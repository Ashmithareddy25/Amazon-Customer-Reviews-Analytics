B000002UAF|5.0|At this point in the Beatles' career, they had perfected the pop rock album.  Of course they would go on to experiment and be one of the few bands that had popular appeal and who blazed musical trails.<br />Of course, when you put this album into the context of the times, they were writing pop music still, and the songs were still all about love. So don't expect too many deep statements.  Of course, these are some of the best poppy love songs you will ever hear as they rock and roll like nobody's business. There aren't any songs i dislike on the album and i especially love the opener and title track, \\"If I Fell,\\" and the classic \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" This album is a must own and will provide you with 30 minutes of pure rocking Beatles fun every time you put it on.
0380820846|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Julia Quinn book so far.<br />I like that Penelope is a rather shy (and plump) wallflower. She is a spinster after only God knows how many seasons, and pines for a dashing sort of guy (Colin). Unfortunately, she isn't the type Colin would be attracted to (even her best friend believes so).<br />But Colin seems to &quot;grow up,&quot; and is soon bewildered at his gradual view of Penelope in a romantic light; he also gets an urge to kick himself because he didn't notice she was a great girl sooner.<br />It's also great that they actually talk about things as friends. Realistically, I don't believe people can become lovers without being friends first.

B000068QY7|5.0|Quite simply, this is a great album by a great band - best album of the year so far, in my opinion. From start to finish, this is their best album ever. Even 'Definitely Maybe' and 'What's the Story Morning Glory' had throw-aways.<br />What's so messed up is how the U.S. ignores Oasis so much. Why won't radio stations play them? In the UK, this was a Top Ten album for like 3 months.
0385495323|5.0|Here comes another absorbing tale from Simon Singh after his equally gripping &quot;Fermat's Last Theorem&quot;. Singh must be applauded for successfully rejuvenating this arcane subject and making it accessible to the curious as well as the specialist. Cryptology is as old as human civilization and the need to put a message in a code or a cipher led to its birth. Since then it had become an inalienable part of statecraft, diplomacy, war and government strategy and now in commercial transactions.<br />Cryptology is a science of encrypting a plain text message/data by a use of a cryptographic algorithm or cipher and making the message secure(cryptography/code-making) and in reverse decrypting the cipher text by various analytical/mathematical tools and breaking the secure data(cryptoanalysis/code-breaking). This book traces the incredible history of cryptology from the time of Caesar (the Caesar Shift cipher) to the present day attempts to secure data using quantum physics(quantum cryptology). This type of encryption is supposed to be so strong that it is impossible to break it with present day tools, but initial strides made in the development of quantum computer(based on the property of subatomic particles to attain all possible quantum states all at once as stated by the Copenhagen Interpretation and therefore computing results of different variables all at one go and thus it's potency, unlike in the present day computers where computation is done sequentially, taking one variable at a time). In between, Singh has plenty to discuss about the development of the Vigenere Cipher(16th century), ADFGVX cipher(used in WW-1), DES and finally to RSA encryption method. In RSA if an extremely large value of 'n' (product of two massive primes) are taken then the combined effort all the computers on this planet will be unable to break the RSA cipher even if they kept on working MANY TIMES the age of the universe! This is because factoring 'n' into its two large primes is extremely difficult. RSA is presently being commercially used for secure internet communications, on smart cards, secure telephones and many commercial software products. RSA differs from other encryption system because it uses public key cryptography, where key exchange could be done on non-secure lines unlike in other cases where secret key exchange is used and which has to be done in highly secure lines.<br />After completing the book, I found some missing topics like a discussion on the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems, the adoption of the Rijndael algorithm as the AES(Advanced Encryption System). However, these omissions in no way weakens subject. Singh has also peppered his storytelling with interesting anecdotes for good measure. Though present day cryptology is heavily dependent on mathematical tools, this book barely contains any mathematics(Only RSA details some math). However, no math does not mean the book is in any way incomplete. <br />All in all, a truly engrossing and fascinating tale about the science of secret writing which doesn't remain so secret in front of Simon Singh's masterly storytelling. Riveting!

B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a movie which follows the comic book development of the charactors with great zeal. Costumes are excellent as are the special effects. Casting is superb and one can only hope that future sequels will use the same Parker, Harry Osborn and Jamison.<br />The story line is clear and easy to understand. You needn't be familiar with the comic book. Charactors develop naturally and can be sympathized with (or hated).<br />Special effects are outstanding. Nothing more to be said.<br />All in all and outstanding movie -- suitable for everyone in the family. I hope that the next movie will be equally as good.<br />Stongly Recommended.<br />~Paul~
B00006SFBD|5.0|I have to admit that when I first spun this album up in the CD player, I was a bit disappointed.  I was expecting Opeth's new album to build on the beautiful complexity that made Blackwater Park my favorite album.  Instead, they seemed to have done away with a lot of it.  Sure, I enjoyed every song, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Opeth had lost something.  Then, I reached &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;.  The sheer beauty made me stop and think &quot;Wait a second- this really IS a good album.  And then I realized what made this one so different.<br />As previously said, Deliverance is a bit simpler compared to Blackwater Park.  The guitars aren't nearly as intricately layered, and the music doesn't change as often.  Instead, Deliverance is full of more neo-metal dissonance and aggression, ala Nothingface.  There are a whole lot more purely dissonant guitar parts (just listen to the opening of the song &quot;Deliverance&quot;) and the guitars are much more rhythmic and at times are treated as percussion instruments.  The drumming is more aggressive and hell-bent than I've ever heard out of Opeth, with a very liberal use of the double bass.  If you listen very, very closely, you can hear at times hints of a keyboard accenting some notes.<BR>Opeth's mellow parts have also been touched by change.  Compared to Blackwater Park's mellow stretches, Deliverance's are actually more complex in my opinion- much more avant-garde and unpredictable, with an incredibly fresh, unique combination of notes.  Opeth also does a little experimentation with the major scale, believe it or not.  Rest assured it's still not &quot;happy music&quot;.<br />So, simpler and more aggressive heavy stuff; more unique and unconventional mellow stuff: depending on what you look for in your Opeth, Deliverance will either be a minor disapointment that grows on you quickly or a truly awesome album.  Hey, I sure grew to love it.  I'm looking foreward to Damnation, how 'bout you?
B00006CXXU|3.0|I think Christina Aguilera is the only real singer among the pop elite today, as opposed to Britney and J.lo, who really can't sing. I will admit I do not like any of them, I don't like pop at all. But, Christina Aguilera, I will admit, has an incredible voice, absolutely amazing. My question is this - why is she appearing almost naked now? I don't get it. Is it to out-skin Britney?  Is the music-buying public so dumb that one has to flash as most skin as possible in order to sell records? Apparently so. Apparently, having incredible natural MUSICAL talent is not enough. I know artists who are basically barely getting by financially, but who are immensely talented. Has anyone heard singer Lara Fabian? She is incredible, I would say sings even better than Christina, but she is not dancing around naked, though she could, as she is stunningly beautiful. But nobody knows about her. It is just pityful that one has to do such lowly things in order to sell. I feel sorry for Christina, because she has ample talent, and in a musically appreciative world (utopia?) she would not need to do anything except use her marvelous voice to give life to her songs. Sad, real sad.
0060930187|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was 15 years old. I thought it was mere happenstance that I encountered it, and every since that first introduction it has stayed on my mind every since.<br />Sylvia Plath was one of the most interesting writers of our time. She wrote what she felt and rarely has there ever been another like her or will there ever be. <br />I feel that the mere emphasis on depression in her book was indeed a wake up call for many during that time. During the 1950's people did not readily express their emotions, basically what wasn't socially acceptable was generally locked up inside. It was no accident that Plath chose to write about her own neurotic feelings from the perspective of someone on the outside looking in.<br />I clearly believe that Plath was desperately relaying her feelings in terms of the constant hopelessness and utter betrayal that she possibly felt as a brilliant,young, white woman during the 1950's who was relatively endowed with all the possibilities that one could ever hope for but still utterly depressed, lonely, and confused.<br />This book gives wonderful insight for those who are depressed,lonely, and confused. Plath actually comes to a sort of numbness when she realizes that the planning and hoping as it might be to be the best is not all that it is cracked up to be.<br />This book is brilliant, and unfortunately Plath committed suicide during her short life and career. Sometimes, I ponder about what could have been if she had lived just a little bit longer. We all face times in which we are unsure but we must strive to continue on.<br />&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was and will always be one of the best books that I have ever read. Its not like &quot;Lisa Black and Dark&quot; or any other dark literature that I can recall at this time. It is because it is a real encounter of a real woman in search of love, comfort, and truth.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is no longer a bubble-gum act. Lordy this girl has grown up. This time around she's giving the world what they really want. Even though she has shocked everyone with Dirrty, the whole album is almost nothing like that. Songs like Soar have a great message to follow your dreams. Alicia Keys wrote Impossible which has amazing vocals and is kind of jazzy. THis album is comepletey different from the first and she sounds amazing. You will get chills every time you hear her voice. Infatuation is the only song that really has a latin influence. Get Mine, Get Yours is a great and flowy dance song. Make Over is really rockish and she gets her anger out. Beautiful is an amazing song about accepting yourself. She sounds amazing on this song and we can all relate. Christina wrote all but one of the songs on this album and it sounds amazing. If you don't have get it because it's going to be a classic.
B00006RAKP|4.0|One of the great pop artists of the last three decades, Elton John(or maybe his record company)again feels the need to release yet another compilation, this time trying to encompass all three decades of his more-often-than-not great work.  As with most compilations involving an artist of John's scope, it falls just shy of being what I would call definitive.  Disc one concentrates primarily on his seventies' work--it's fairly spot-on in terms of quality.  Disc two, however, has some definite head-scratching selections.  Conspicuously missing--  'Blue Eyes', 'Healing Hands','You Gotta Love Someone', and 'The Last Song', to name four.  I find it hard to believe that John would actually rank trifle like 'Written In The Stars' or even sap like 'Blessed' higher than any of the aforementioned four. And while I'm glad the highly underrated 'I Want Love' is present, why include 'This Train Don't Stop There Anymore' which, in the whole scheme of things, remains barely a blip on the radar?(If he had to have more than one track from SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST, I would rather have seen the better 'Original Sin' instead).  Overall, this is more than solid, but could have actually been even better.
B000060P79|3.0|Simple Plan brings absolutely nothing new, musically or lyrically, to the pop-punk scene as we know it, flat out. That said, this release still has its moments and the band is young and energetic. That in itself shows some promise. The songs deal with the average teenager's life: girls, high school, and problems with parents. Pretty cliche stuff. However, if you are still interested to see what these fellas can dish out, and you have some extra money laying around; go pick it up. There are some worthy tracks with pretty good repeat value on &quot;No Pads, No Helmets....&quot; They're worth a try.
B00001U0CP|4.0|The eighth novel in Patricia Cornwell's series of books centered around the world of Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta finds the good doctor up to her elbows again in a case that draws heavily on the past.  Someone is dumping dimembered torsos into landfills, and it's a thread that dates back to a similar case ten years prior in Europe.  The question is whether this is the same killer or perhaps a copycat.  Along the way, Scarpetta gets exposed to a deadly pox virus--the same one found on the last discovered torso and one that is spreading through a local crabbing town located off the mainland.  While in quarantine, Scarpetta manages to lure the killer--screen name deadoc--into a chat room on the internet in an attempt to ferret out his location.  As with most of her previous novels, Cornwell's greatest strength beyond her own personal knowledge of forensics is the relationships she's established throughout the run of the series.  Scarpetta's relationship with police detective Pete Marino remains the most honest and fascinating of the bunch, while her on/off relationship with profiler Benton Wesley remains nothing more than a boring and uninteresting sidenote.  In the end, though, this is another solid entry in Cornwell's already considerable catalog.
B00006690G|3.0|Fortunately for his fans, Eminem has not changed.  He still can rap, he still hates everybody, and he's still not afraid to say it.  Any doubts that he would be around for a long time are shattered once and for all in The Eminem Show.<br />However, perhaps realizing that pure shock value wasn't going to sell his records this time around, Eminem  added some more pop elements to appeal to more mainstream fans.  Several tracks feature him singing (poorly), and others show a sappy side of Eminem that doesn't really befit his style.  Most rap fans that I know don't buy Eminem albums for love songs and ballads about him cleaning out his closet.  Granted, on the majority of tracks Eminem shows that he hasn't lost his edge or his flair.  And mixing things up isn't necessarily a bad thing.  He just has to make sure  his original fans aren't alienated--which they aren't...yet. <BR>    <BR>Some may applaud his \\"creative expression\\"  and say that his experimentation with different kinds of music shows how he has grown as an artist. Yet it's interesting to note that the best tracks, like \\"Business\\" and \\"When the Music Stops\\", are where he collaborates with his old friends Dr. Dre and D-12, his backup group who still has yet to get the respect they deserve.  It may be like his old stuff, but that's what he's best at.  Afterall, since when is laying down phat beats with Dr. Dre a bad thing?  <br />As he points out on the album, Eminem is our Elvis.  But remember even Elvis didn't write his own songs.  Eminem's an amazing talent as a rapper and and lyricist.  But he's not good enough to leave behind the people and the technique that got him to where he is now.  This album is very good, I just hope that his future ones are too.

B000002L82|5.0|PCL is slowly becoming my favorite New Order album.  It's not quite Joy Division, not quite Mid to Late era New Order... it's the band at thier most experimental.  For you that means you're getting some excellent material.  Granted, this album is somewhat inconsistant: We All Stand sounds like a bad demo, and Ultraviolence isn't one of my favorites (plus, Blue Monday and The Beach are awakardly tossed in- If I want to listen to Blue Monday I'll put in Substance).  However, everything else is just fantastic... It probably will take a little while to grow on you, but give it time.  I don't know how you can accuse Benard of being incapable as a frontman; His voice is very distinctive and adds a lot of emotion to the album.  The lyrics, as previously stated, are about everything and nothing.  Plus, I want to mention... 586, while containing some simailar sounding material from Blue Monday, is a completly different song with new lyrics and everything.  Don't let the sample on Amazon fool you... The song really only takes off a minute or so after it starts.<BR><BR>Classic New Order!  Pick it up, give it time, learn to love it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Forget about her ultra-sexy clothes or new trampy image.  Aguilera has a superb voice and works with many styles on her latest, from old-school R&B to hip hop and smooth soul. Standouts include the duet with Lil' Kim, \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\"  the Latin-tinged \\"Infatuation\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Loving Me 4 Me,\\" on which she sounds like a cross between Mariah Carey and the late Minnie Riperton.  Also look for the hard-edged rocker \\"Fighter.\\"  The first-released single \\"Dirrty\\" really is no representation of the album.  It's a bit too overproduced and doesn't really allow Aguilera's voice to do its work as her vocals are drowned out by too many sirens and beats.  Aguilera really proves she has a great multi-octave vocal range on \\"Stripped.\\"  She totally eclipses Britney and the teenybopper image with this one.

B00006M183|5.0|A bold statement, to be sure, but bear with me.  Pearl Jam has been cranking out good music album to album for the last decade.  From Ten to Vs. they showed great growth and accomplished what was, until now, their finest moment.  Then Vitalogy and No Code, while both contained some great songs, were spotty at best.  Then they decided to refine their sound, and Yield and Binaural followed, both solid albums, especially Binaural.  Now they bring us Riot Act, the culmination of the two previous efforts, and the results are impressive.  They have proved that altering their sound didn't affect the quality of the songwriting.  With folksy tunes like the first single, &quot;I Am Mine&quot; and &quot;Love Boat Captain,&quot; and the prerequisite rockers like &quot;Save You,&quot; &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Get Right&quot; they show their versatility.  The surprise track of the album may be &quot;You Are,&quot; a song written by their latest and greatest drummer, Matt Cameron, formerly of Soundgarden.  I have never heard a Pearl Jam song that sounds quite like it, and it's a great mid-point of the album.  &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; is a part spoken word, part singing track, in the tradition of &quot;Push Me, Pull Me&quot; from Yield, that's a tribute to our beloved (sic) president.  &quot;Green Disease&quot; brings to mind &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; albeit not as classic a song.  The album closes, after a brief, minute-long track of moaning or something, with &quot;All or None,&quot; a great, partially piano-driven track, perhaps the best on the album.  Mike McCready's solos abound and are in top form, Cameron's drumming is top notch as always, and Eddie Vedder's vocals, which are aped by nearly every throwaway rock band that surfaces these days, are fabulous as always, even if he doesn't go for the high end as often as he used to.  Pearl Jam continue to impress me more with each subsequent album, and with nary a wasted minute, this has to be their best.  I can't wait for thenext one.

B000002N3J|5.0|After the relatively poor success of her previous albums (Erotica and Bedtime Stories), Madonna returned to top form in 1995 with Something To Remember - a stunning collection of beautiful ballads from the Queen of Pop herself. The hits on Something To Remember span a total of 12 years, from 1984's Love Don't Live Here Anymore to 1996's One More Chance. All Madonna's greatest ballads ever are all here in the ultimate collection of Madonna's finest slow-jams. The album peaked at No.3 in the UK in November 1995, and has sold 10 million copies to date worldwide. This album not only portrayed a more mature style to Madonna's vocal and songwriting abilities, but signalled that Madonna's sex-era was coming to an end...<br /><br />The album starts with the superb and equally haunting I Want You. Madonna guest stars with Massive Attack on this superb ballad, yet it's Madonna's excellent vocals that make this song so exquisite. The song was never released as a single, which in a way can be a good thing; if it had been released, it would've been overplayed (having it just on this album makes it more personal). Track 2 is I'll Remember. This average Madonna song was the soundtrack to the flop film, With Honors and peaked at No.7 in the UK in April 1994. Tracks 3, 4 and 5 are Take A Bow, You'll See and Crazy For You which charted at No.16 in December 1994, No.5 in October 1995 and No.2 in March 1985 respectively. I consider Take A Bow to be one of Madonna's best ballads - and definitely one of the best on Something To Remember. You'll See is a serious and moving ballad with some amazing vocals and powerful basslines. Crazy For You, on the other hand, is another excellent slow-jam that sounds perfect playing it around Christmas time. This trilogy of classic Madonna ballads is followed by track 6, This Used To Be My Playground. Another splendid song, This Used To Be My Playground is my favourite song on the entire album. The song was released in August 1992 and peaked at No.3 in the UK, going two better at No.1 in the US. The song was the theme to the hit baseball movie, A League Of Their Own and has some amazing lyrics and instruments. Tracks 7 and 8 are Live To Tell and Love Don't Live Here Anymore. The former is a poignant and powerful ballad, one of Madonna's most memorable hits to date and peaked at No.2 in the UK in April 1986. The latter however, was never released as a single but featured on Madonna's second album Like A Virgin, yet a video was made for it. Madonna showcases her full vocal ability on this phenomenal cover version - can the album get any better?!<br /><br />Well the answer to that question is yes! Track 9 is Something To Remember and is quite different to anything Madonna has ever done before. First featured on 1990's I'm Breathless, this smoochy ballad has a superb bassline and is reminiscent of 1950's jazz. Overall, another fantastic ballad from Madge! Track 10 is Forbidden Love. The song was never released as a single and featured on Madonna's 1994 album Bedtime Stories. The song is more up-tempo than slow, so even though it's a great song, I wouldn't have included it on Something To Remember. Track 11 is One More Chance and peaked at a lowly No.11 in the UK in March 1996. The main reason the song probably peaked so low is because of lack of radio airplay with no video to go with it. The song follows a sort of acapella style which exposes Madonna's raw vocals a lot more so than if the song had been studio-produced. Tracks 12 and 13 are Rain and Oh Father. Rain was released in July 1993 from the album Erotica and peaked at No.7 in the UK. The song is superb with some beautiful lyrics. Oh Father originally featured on Madonna's 1989 album Like A Prayer, but was released as a single in January 1996 after featuring on this album, peaking at No.16 in the UK. The video caused a lot of controversy, but unusually (for Madonna) didn't result in making the single a big worldwide hit. Track 14 is I Want You (ORCHESTRAL). This is just the same version as the one earlier in the album, yet (as if it wasn't obvious) is an Orchestral version - not as good as the original, but still good.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />All in all, Something To Remember is essential for every Madonna fan - and also those who aren't interested in her. If you're looking for a definitive ballads collection, choose this! Many artists have tried before in the past to do what Madonna has done by releasing a ballads collection, but failed terribly (Elton John springs to mind). Madonna, however, pulls it off with ease. Along with Ray Of Light, Erotica and The Immaculate Collection, this is one of Madonna's most essential albums. Is this better than The Immaculate Collection? Not quite, but time may change all that...me version as the one earlier in the album, yet (as if it wasn't obvious) is an Orchestral version - not as good as the original, but still good.

B00005Q66T|5.0|Throughout the 1990's, Madonna's The Immaculate Collection sold more than 22 million copies worldwide and gained a reputation as one of the most complete and essential greatest hits collection ever - Madonna was going to have a job on her hands to repeat the success of that with her follow up, Greatest Hits: Volume 2 (GHV2) which was released worldwide on November 12th 2001. Basically, it doesn't take a genius to realise that GHV2 doesn't quite live up to the \\"immaculate\\" (no pun intended) quality that The Immaculate Collection so proudly displays. Firstly, GHV2 contains no new material from Madonna, whereas The Immaculate Collection contained two new songs - Justify My Love and Rescue Me. Secondly, every song on The Immaculate Collection was a massive hit worldwide, which is probably the reason it did so well. GHV2 on the other hand, has a few songs that are less recognisable - Bedtime Stories, Take A Bow and Secret are an example of this. Despite these few mishaps, GHV2 is saved by songs from the albums Ray Of Light and Music. It's the sheer quality in terms of lyrics and vocal ability on songs such as Frozen, The Power Of Goodbye, Ray Of Light and Music that made GHV2 the must-have, essential album of 2001...even if it was beaten to No.1 by Westlife - we'll see who's still around in 10 years time!<br />The album opens with Deeper And Deeper and Erotica. Both songs were taken from her controversial 1992 album Erotica. The former is a fantastic dance party track - the true definition of Madonna at her most up-beat and camp; ironically, the song was supposedly about a young gay coming to terms with his homosexuality. Erotica, on the other hand, dealed with the pure raunch factor that had family groups up in arms. The song is pure fun, but with all the kinky, soft-core sex thrown in for good measure. The song is superb, yet the image of a dominatrix-clad Madonna always pops into my head everytime I hear it! After this, we move onto Human Nature and Secret - both tracks of which were taken from Madonna's 1994's album, Bedtime Stories. Both songs are average at best; not the type of music I like and love Madonna for. Track 5 is Don't Cry For Me Argentina. The song was taken from the film Evita in which Madonna starred as Eva Peron alongside Antonio Banderas. Track 6 is Bedtime Story - the third song on GHV2 to be taken from the album Bedtime Stories. The song is fantastic to say the least and has beautiful, yet strange lyrics with a catchy dance beat produced by Bjork. The album chugs on with The Power Of Goodbye and Beautiful Stranger. Both songs are examples of some of Madonna's greatest 1990's work. The Power Of Goodbye was taken from Madonna's superb and critically acclaimed 1998 No.1 album Ray Of Light. The song has a superb instrument arrangement with some beautiful, almost royal, vocals from Madonna. Beautiful Stranger is pure pop fun and was the soundtrack to the hit film, Austin Powers II. \\"If I'm smart then I'll run away, but I'm not so I guess I'll stay,\\" sings Madonna. The lyrics are total silliness (in a good way) and shows Madonna in a totally different light from the dark and moody phase of the mother-Earth era (Ray Of Light). We're dragged back to the mother-Earth era with Frozen, a superb and hauntingly poetic power-ballad that shot straight to No.1 in February 1998 - Madonna's first UK No.1 since 1990's Vogue. Take A Bow from Bedtime Stories is Track 10. This is one of Madonna's best ballads to date, peaking at No.1 in the US for seven consecutive weeks in 1994. Tracks 11 and 12 are Ray Of Light and Don't Tell Me, taken from the albums Ray Of Light and Music respectively. The former saw Madonna back on the dancefloor as it proudly portrays funky dance beats and loud party vocals. Madonna admits that the song's about celebration and living life to the full. Don't Tell Me is a wonderful country pop song with same jerky beats and brilliant vocals - the video featured Madonna dancing around in cowboy gear! Not surprisingly for the Queen of Pop, it set off another fashion craze - a trend that would've been unthinkable as well as laughable a year previously. GHV2 continues with What It Feels Like For A Girl and Drowned World/Substitute For Love, taken from the albums Music and Ray Of Light respectively. I like both songs, but I think they should've included the Dance Remix of What It Feels Like For A Girl, as the version that features is so-so. The final song on GHV2 is Music, which was Madonna's most recent No.1 in August 2000. The song is one of Madonna's most popular of her entire career and is a great way to close such a superb album.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br />All in all, GHV2 is an essential album for every Madonna fan in the world. The album had record pre-advance orders of 800,000 in the UK and has sold 10 million copies worldwide. Whilst GHV2 is a superb album with the songs it has to offer, I think it could've been so much better by adding hits such as the US No.1 This Used To Be My Playground and other hits such as Rain, Bad Girl, Nothing Really Matters and her 2000 UK No.1, American Pie. If these excellent songs had been included on GHV2 along with two or three new songs, it would've been the perfect greatest hits album - definitely surpassing The Immaculate Collection. If it had some new material, it would've sold twice as much as a lot of die-hard Madonna fans did not buy this through the lack of new material. Anyway - I'm waffling...GHV2 is superb, Madonna is superb and so are you if you buy this from Amazon now!isingly for the Queen of Pop, it set off another fashion craze - a trend that would've been unthinkable as well as laughable a year previously.

B00005N919|5.0|I love everything that makes my skin crawl with suspense. Basic Instinct is one of the cleverest erotic-slash-psychological thrillers ever made. This film was also a milestone for Sharon Stone, who was practical unknown at the time. Her role as the sinister and manipulative novelist Catherine Tramell is incredible -- Stone cleverly makes the character seem dark and complex. The handsome Michael Douglas also does an excellent job playing the troubled detective Nick Curran. The erotic scenes aren't overdone -- they're vital to the twists in the story. As I've already said, Basic Instinct is one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made! I recommend this DVD most highly!
B00004X01U|5.0|Throughout 1998 and 1999, Madonna portrayed the mother-Earth image in videos such as \\"Frozen,\\" \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" and \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" which was backed by her phenomenal comeback album, \\"Ray Of Light.\\" Her fans loved it but by 2000, they seemed to be sick of it - as we all know, Madonna is the pop chameleon of re-invention and people were dying to know what she would do next. Quite possibly one of the greatest transitions in her 20 year career, Madonna did the total opposite to being all serious and moody - she let it all hang out and partied into the new millennium. The career change worked a charm when she released her eighth studio album \\"Music,\\" in September 2000. The album went straight to No.1 in the UK and US - and a staggering 24 other countries worldwide, a feat not matched by Madonna since 1986's \\"True Blue\\" (No.1 in 28 countries). Music followed a similar style to Ray Of Light, but was more pop/dance-oriented rather than the techno/electronica-oriented feel of Ray Of Light. Madonna had a job on her hands if she wanted to please her fans. How could she provide the world with another stunning album like Ray Of Light? The simple answer is that she couldn't - Music is good, but doesn't come near Ray Of Light and I'm not sure another record in her career will do the same...<br /><br />Music begins with the album's title track, \\"Music.\\" Undoubtedly a Madonna classic, Music was released in August 2000 and rocketed straight to No.1. The feel-good dance beats and computerised lyrics were a refreshing change from the Queen of Pop - people loved it, but was it here to stay? A die-hard fan of Madonna will know her style never stays permanent. \\"Impressive Instant\\" is the next song. This is another superb dance track that went down a treat at Madonna's Drowned World Tour in 2001. It's sort of a follow up to Music with a similar bassline and voice co-ordination. The biggest crime is that it wasn't released as a single. \\"Runaway Lover\\" is another great song, because it has a high-pitched, echoing beat with a Mr Oizi (Flat Beat) style bassline! It's yet another fast-paced disco-filler that would've sounded perfect on Ray Of Light. For some strange and unexplainable reason, the song always reminds me of a ship out at sea in a storm - it's probably the \\"You don't care where you drop your anchor\\" lyrics and the beat that sounds like it's rising from the sea bed to the surface after the lyrics, \\"It doesn't pay!\\" that are repeated over and over. Definitely an album highlight. \\"I Deserve It\\" is a slower song. This mid-tempo indie track is an obvious complement to Madonna's hubby, Guy Ritchie (\\"This Guy was meant for me\\"). The song is also a thank you to her tens of millions of fans across the world as Madonna croons, \\"Many miles, many roads I have travelled - fallen down on the way. Many heart, many years have unravelled - leading up 'til today.\\"<br /><br />\\"Amazing\\" is a good song, but seems a bit too much like a weaker version of Beautiful Stranger. This song was co-written and produced by William Orbit - the man behind Ray Of Light. The song lacks the emotion of any of the tracks he previously produced on Ray Of Light, but the fun and high-energy choruses, bassline and beats make up for it. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" is rather slow but still beautiful. This soft and mellow mid-tempo ballad is quite strange. Madonna's vocals have vocoder special-effects on them which might sound cringe-worthy, but this is Madonna and she can make anything sound good! The album continues on a high with \\"Don't Tell Me.\\" This country/pop inspired song was the second song to be taken from the album Music in November 2000, where it peaked at No.4 in the UK. The video saw Madonna clad in cowboy gear as she danced her way around with a selection of cowboys. The choice set off an international craze as fashion designers all over the world fell over themselves to re-create Madonna's unique style - a style that would've been unthinkable a year previously. \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" is a soft and gorgeous almost-lullaby song. This was the fourth and final single to be taken from Music in April 2001. The video caused outrage around the world. \\"Madonna drives the censors potty - again!\\" screamed the headlines. The video was banned from MTV and released on DVD worldwide - once again, Madonna made millions from the sales proving she knows how to make a bob or two! The single version was a dance remix, while the album version is a much more mellow and calm effort.<br /><br />\\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" is the album's masterpiece. This superb song clocks in at over six and a half minutes and was produced by William Orbit. This time he gets it spot on; this amazingly complex yet simplistic gem is definitely Ray Of Light material and is one of the best songs on this album. \\"Gone\\" is This is another mid-tempo indie/rock song with a superb acoustic guitar solo. Despite being an all round brilliant song, I see it as the worst on the whole album. \\"American Pie\\" is Madonna's much-hated cover, which flopped in the US! This was the first single to be taken from Music in February 2000, where it peaked at No.1 in the UK - Madonna's ninth UK No.1 single. This cover of Don McLean's classic is superb and expertly done - another superb song from Ms Ritchie.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Music is an album that not only has superb creativity through its lyrics and beats, but also strengthens the theory that Madonna truly in the greatest female artist that has ever walked the Earth. If you don't have Music buy it now to add to your Madonna collection. I've had it since Christmas 2000 and listen to it on a regular basis. It's one of those albums that you might forget about a bit, but once you drag it out again you'll find a whole bunch of new reasons of why you loved it so much in the first place.t Feels Like For A Girl\\" is a soft and gorgeous almost-lullaby song.

0316666343|5.0|I already want to read this book again, and I only finished it 2 days ago!  What a beautiful, beautiful novel written by Alice Sebold.  I could not put it down.<br />The story takes place from Suzie Salmon's point of view from heaven, and goes into what happens on earth after she is killed when she is 14.  The characters were so perfectly developed, and her writing is so perfect, that I actually read certain sections over and over again, hoping to commit her words to my memory.<br />I cannot wait for her to write another novel.  I've just started \\"Lucky\\", her non fiction account of her own rape.  I am loving that one too...but I yearn to read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" again.
B00005RDAF|5.0|Notice how I just said \\"another great Britney video\\"? That's my way of saying that Britney Spears puts out superb home music videos everytime without fail. This third offering from the Princess of Pop may only be 30 minutes long, yet is packed with amazing, must-see stuff for Britney fans everywhere. It is called Britney: The Videos, yet contains only two actual music videos - three if you count Overprotected which is just a performance with out-takes from Crossroads. In November 2001, Britney released her third album, Britney. It went to No.1 all over the world, sold 17 million copies...blah, blah, blah - see my review of the album for more. Later in the month, Britney: The Videos was released as a sort of essential item of merchandise to accompany the album. Everytime Britney releases a video, sales go through the roof - especially in America. At its short time-length, this video surpassed everyone's expectations as it topped the VHS chart for ages in the US and has only just left the Top 20 - almost a year after it was released!<br />The video begins with the music video to Britney's April 2001 hit, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know which was taken from her second album Oops!...I Did It Again. The video is set on a deserted beach as Britney runs around, scantily-clad with the love of her life. The video is beautiful - and not just because of Britney! The sky is a deep blue/purple and the sea is so calm. Despite this, the video caused a lot of controversy, but not enough for the single to go Top 10 in the UK - her only single not to chart in the UK Top 10 to date. The video also apparently caused outrage with Britney's mum who condemned her daughter for producing such a raunchy video - she had no bad comments to say about the I'm A Slave 4 U (which I regard to be even more steamy than the video in question), which makes you think that this whole affair with Britney's mum being shocked was another false accusation by the world's press from the Britney Rumour-Mill. Speaking of I'm A Slave 4 U, the next feature is probably the best on the whole video. In September 2001, at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, the whole world got a sneek-peak of Britney's new single I'm A Slave 4 U. Britney wasn't nominated for any awards, but stole the entire show with her controversial and highly-publicised performance. She went on-stage with real live tigers and lions and even belly-danced with a poisonous snake. As it wrapped itself around her neck and arms, it became the most envied creature on Earth amongst millions of red-blooded the world over! The third featurette on Britney: The Videos is Joy Of Pepsi. In March 2001, Britney signed a (estimated) $90 million deal to be the face of Pepsi. The first advert she made was called Joy Of Pepsi - and is on this video. This 90-second advert features Britney dressed in an amazing outfit as she struts her stuff in a Pepsi factory. In the advert, Britney is like the boss of Pepsi in more ways than one; through 2001, Pepsi reported a worldwide increase in their sales. Many popular singers such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, the Spice Girls, Robbie Williams and Gareth Gates have sponsored Pepsi - but Britney has proved to be the biggest hit with the mega soft-drink firm. The fourth feature in this video is the video to I'm A Slave 4 U. Released in October 2001, the song was a huge hit worldwide peaking at No.4 in the UK. The video was equally, if not more, successful than the song - especially where male fans are concerned! A lot of people say Britney looks awful in this video, but how does she?! She is the ultimate definition of a female sex-symbol of the 21st Century - this video supports this theory even more. The fifth and sixth features are Britney Strikes A Pose and I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (Sydney Performance) respectively. The former is an average feature where Britney plays around on a photoshoot for Vogue magazine while the superb song Anticipating (from her third album Britney) plays in the background. The latter is just another average performance of Britney singing the otherwise brilliant ballad I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman in Sydney, Australia in September 2001 - before the September 11th terrorist attacks...<br />The video continues with Overprotected (featuring out-takes from Crossroads) and HBO Presents Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas. Again, the former is a great feature as Britney performs her huge hit Overprotected (UK No.4, January 2002) while funny out-takes from Crossroads are added in. The latter is the worst feature on the video. This is only the advertisement for Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas, not the actual concert which was released earlier this year. The advert is a bare 45 seconds long - not worthy of reviewing! The final featurette on Britney: The Videos is The Making Of Crossroads. This is one of the video's highlights as we go behind-the-scenes and witness Britney filming her debut film Crossroads. It has interviews with Britney (Lucy) herself, along with co-stars Taryn Manning (Mimi), Zoe Saldana (Kit) and Anson Mount (Ben) and director Tamra Davis. The video ends as the credits roll with several pictures of Britney as the song Let Me Be (from her third album, Britney) plays.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br />All in all, Britney: The Videos is another must-have, essential Britney Spears home music video for every Britney fan. I so feel, however, that the video was a little rushed. There's so much more that they could've included such as Britney's other two amazing MTV Video Music Awards performances from 199 and 2000, along with the music videos to Born To Make You Happy and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart from her debut album Baby One More Time which don't feature on Britney two previous home videos - Time Out With Britney and Britney - Live And More. They could also have included a special Britney Awards where all the awards that Britney has won over the past 4 years were featured. Oh well, no point in moaning!

B00005BJR0|3.0|When, oh when, will they release a REAL Blade Runner DVD?  This classic deserves a heck of a package with it's legendary status and enduring popularity.  Yet we sit around with an inferior version.  Hey, you folks at the studios KNOW there is a market for this film - why not give us (and believe me, there are many of us) what we want?  I promise you will get the dollars that you crave.  Just give us a decent release and soon?  You did it with LEGEND and heaven knows that film deserves nothing more than the crumbs of Blade Runner.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|I can't believe anyone would let this movie be produced for the amount of money it cost to make it.  Surely someone could have written a decent sequel to the first one (which was wonderful).  I am sorry I spent any money seeing this movie.   Not real original with the jokes.  It was a true waste of talent for T. Jones and W. Smith to have been in this movie, and what an embarrassment for both of them!
B000002LND|4.0|What  a  title !!  It  couldn't  possibly  be  a  dig  at  \\"Immaculate  Conception\\"  could  it ??

But as these were the early songs....the singing (voice) could be better....less of a bleat. She has improved since  (I think after Evita).<BR> <BR>Considering that I am not a Madonna fan (though I admire<BR>her daring marketing, power-total control thing, in-your-face innovativeness), I guess it says something when I still went out & bought this CD anyway.

B00005RY7X|5.0|There isn't a single insightful thing said on this album, yet it's still one of my favorites of this past year. Andrew W.K.'s \\"She Is Beautiful\\" probably sums this whole album up, as there is no real artistic venture past thrashing anthems and drinking songs; in fact, this whole album is nothing more than loud, trashy anthems dedicated to drinking and partying. Yet, isn't it great? This album's strong points are in its catchiness and its great instrumentals. The powerful \\"Violent Life\\" probably has the deepest lyrics of all the tracks on the album, but after-all it is an instrumental. Truly this album's theme is nothing necessarily bright or fascinating, but it's the raw sound itself, the amount of energy-pumping explosions in each chorus that makes it a true gem. The album can get redundant after a while though, with the choruses being repeated to the point where you wonder: is this supposed to be a sampler? Still, it's a great album any contemporary rock fan should look in to. \\"I love NYC\\", \\"Don't Stop Living in the Red\\", and the fast \\"I Get Wet\\" are the shining tracks on this album.

Would like to hear from someone who has seen the Full Screen to see if there is a difference (like mfrs screwed up)<br />But having said that, the movie was awesome. The acting was great and wouldn't be surprised to find a Spiderman 2 coming soon.

B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears's third studio-recorded album, appropriately titled 'Britney', is actually not bad at all, as some would believe. Britney even co-wrote much of the music on this album and some of the songs get very personal. Here is the album's track listings:<br />1.) \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" ~ funky, upbeat song. I like it! Keeps you moving on the dance floor. 4/5 stars<br />2.) \\"Overprotected\\" ~ the DarkChild remix is actually better, but this song is still very catchy and great for dancing. 5/5 stars<br />3.) \\"Lonely\\" ~ not one of my favorites. OK upbeat song, but kind of strange. 3/5 stars<br />4.) \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" ~ one of my favorite Britney ballads. Think she can't sing? Just listen to this song! 5/5 stars<br />5.) \\"Boys\\" ~ fun dance song! Love it, especially the song's topic! (lol) 5/5 stars<br />6.) \\"Anticipating\\" ~ great R&B-sounding dance song. One of my favorites. 5/5 stars<br />7.) \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" ~ cool remake of the classic Joan Jett song. Very cool beat. 5/5 stars<br />8.) \\"Cinderella\\" ~ another one of my favorites. Like the beat and the lyrics. 5/5 stars<br />9.) \\"Let Me Be\\" ~ an OK upbeat song. 3/5 stars<br />10.) \\"Bombastic Love\\" ~ catchy, upbeat song. It's different, but I like it. 4/5 stars<br />11.) \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" ~ a good slower song, not exactly a ballad, but slower than most of the other songs. 3/5 stars<br />12.) \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" ~ the song written by Justin Timberlake and Wade Robinson. OK, but I don't really like Justin. It would've sounded better without him. 3/5 stars<br />Like I said before, Britney's third album is a pretty awesome one. Britney's voice works well with the songs she is given. She's a great performer and deserves way more credit than what she gets. <br />I highly recommend 'Britney', by Britney Spears.<br />Score:<BR>85/100<BR>B
0316666343|5.0|Novels that create strong emotional responses and an empathic human connection with their readers do not occur often. When they do, readers long to spread the word in a desire to share their reading experience with as many friends and family members as posible.<br />Such is the case with THE LOVELY BONES, a story about the rape and murder of 14 y.o. Susie Salmon and her observations from her heaven during the ensuing years, as her family and friends cope with the loss. At times funny and other times sad, it is always poignant and insightful with the ability to make the reader reflect on how s/he would think and feel in similar situations.<br />This beautiful story is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for those who need to slow down and reflect upon the gifts of life and the love of family.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is simply the best jazz album you'll ever get!
B00006M183|5.0|After almost giving up on my favorite band after the release of their last album, &quot;Binaural&quot; I'd have to say that Pearl Jam has come back with this release.  While the songs on Binaural were well-written, they didn't seem to reach out to you and pull you in like this album does.  If I had to compare this album to any, I'd say that its a return the PJ's early days- prior to No Code.  The first track, &quot;Can't Keep,&quot; could have been lifted right off of &quot;Ten,&quot; whereas other tracks such as &quot;Save You,&quot; &quot;Cropduster,&quot; and &quot;Green Disease&quot; remind me of PJ during the Vitalogy timeframe.  Matt Cameron's contribution to the songwriting on the album seems to have inspired in the band a grungier, punkier feel that has been missing in the last few albums.  &quot;You Are,&quot; and &quot;Get Right,&quot; both written by Cameron are standouts. The slower &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; is a track unlike any other song on the album and is of the best Vedder's ever written. If you've given up on this band, don't give up yet.  &quot;Riot Act&quot; seems to have brought Pearl Jam back to its roots with a multi-layered mix of rock and punk with a few surprises thrown in, and is the band's strongest release since Vitalogy.

B000002LEE|5.0|With all the media hype about &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual&quot; everyone seemed to forget about &quot;Nothing Shocking.&quot; To put it in plain, simple english, this cd will deliver Janes Addiction at their best. If the cover art doesn't get your attention, the music contained inside will. Just buy this cd and play it very loud.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I cannot believe how amazing this album is. Since the day that I bought it, it has not left my cd player. This is one of the few albums that I don't skip around. All the tracks are worth listening to. Beautiful is really beutiful, Walk Away is so vocally astounding and I'm Okay leaves you in tears. Ms. Aguilera has definitely turned me into a fan of hers. She's got  the voice and writing talents to last her for years to come. You go girl!! You are beautiful, no matter what they say.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne claims she is all punk and tries her hardest to avoid the pop image. The album is great but it is very pop in my opinion. It all depends really on what pop means to you. To me pop is the way the music sounds. It doesn't have anything to do with whether you wrote the words and the fact you can play guitar. I know both these things apply to Avril. Regardless this album is very much pop. It may not be Britney but it is POP! The way she looks doesn't matter either. The props I will give will be for the fact that the album is nice and many of the songs have a nice melodies and Avril does hve a fairly decent voice. If only she wasn't so &quot;IN YOUR FACE&quot; about herself then i'm sure i would be able to enjoy this album more if i didn't have to constantly think about what a juvenile she is. She thinks she knows herself so well but in time she will find she is wrong. I'm am not sure who Avril is... her image and &quot;claims at total punk&quot; or the way her voice sounds and the lyrics. Time will tell and it might take awhle and a few more album mistakes but i am sure that Avril will find her true self-whatever she is.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam are not trying to write new Jeremy or ALive, they just evolve in their prefferd directions and don`t care about others at all. Riot Act, their 7th studio album (after Ten, Vs, Vitalogy, No Code, Yield and Binaural), isn`t an effort, because they are so good and trained after this years that they don`t have to try to make a good album - they just do. Many crititcs have again tried to analize Vedder and his fears and battles, wich really pisses me off - this is a quintet, damn it! So don`t belive bad marks in \\"professionals\\" magazines such as Rolling Stone - they have too much issues with this group to be objective. I will try to be objective, although I am a great fan. So, being very objective  - they`ve outdone (if that is even possible) themselves again. <br />1. Can`t keep - No Code style song, nice vocals and catchy tune. Intro song, you know.    4/5<br />2. Save you - Oh my god. Killing riffs, great lyrics, wild and uncotrolled - new Evolution. An easter egg - includes lines from their VS song, Don`t go.   5/5<br />3. Love Boat Captain - Dedicated to nine fans that died during their concert, Love Boat Captain is wavy, great paced and overall beautifull song.   5/5<br />4.Cropduster - Binaural style song, with great lines (this world is an accident...)and great music, written by Matt Cameron, drummer.   5/5<br />5. Ghost - now, I can`t really identify this one. Maybe a strange hard alter-rock song with distorted guitars and nice refrain. Written by Jeff Ament, the bassist.   4/5<br />6. I Am Mine - not much to say. A fantastic old-school song, first single and already legendary lyrics - I know I was borng and I now that I`ll die, the In between is mine. 5/5<br />7. Tumbling my way - The closest Vedder will ever get to Dylan - and very very close indeed, I must say. A powerfull and beautifull song with to-die-for lyrics and definetly a song that will not get so much attention that it deserves.  5/5<br />8. You are - experimental guitars, abstract lyrics,but it still sounds great and interesting.  5/5<br />9. Wanted to Get Right - Cameron`s song, nothing special, great McCready solo although.  3/5<br />10. Green Disease - Oh yeah - Vedder`s love towards nature (he even smokes American Spirit cigarettes, no chemical additives)and hatred towards money and corporation explodes in this song...I just like it very much - it is not very catchy, but it has power. 5/5<br />11. Help Help - Ament`s song, experimental - just give it time, it will grow on you.  4/5<br />12. Bushleaguer - You will hear about this song a lot and probably hear it a lot - Anti-Bush tune, Vedder chants 3/4 of words. It is a pollitical attempt, but still has great music (Stone).  4/5<br />13. 1/2 Full - song that just keeps going, great and inovative riffs, again great lyrics. 4/5<br />14. Arc - Well...this one [is no good]. It can be understood as a provocation, but...just...doesn`t have a point, doesn`t fit in an album concept. They should just left it out.  1/5<br />15. All or None - Oh yeah - blues!!! I just love it - Vedders sounds very soft, everything is soft, but still not too much - aa grunge blues song. Just love it.   5/5<br />Pearl Jam don`t have to evolve, they just have to do what they do best - write great songs. And, yes, this album is full of them. Go get it. You won`t be dissapointed.

0380977788|2.0|If you're under 13, this book might be good for you.  But the audience that enjoys Harry Potter will definitely not want to spend money at an overpriced bookstore for this book.  I got it through my book club, so I can't complain, but it's just not that great.<br />I'm sure by now you've heard the premise, but this book evidences something Gaiman once mentioned in his blog, \\"plot coupons\\".  In this case, it's other children who've been caught by the Other Parents.<br />The book is too straightforward and, while creepy enough to keep the interest of the target audience, is just not GOOD enough to justify Neil Gaiman's name being on it.  I've enjoyed everything else Neil Gaiman has done (except Stardust, which really didn't do it for me), but Coraline just isn't that good.  Sorry, Neil.  Better luck next time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I had high expectations for this album, and I am glad to say that they were completely fulfilled. \\"Stripped\\" is an amazing album comprised of a range of different genres such as R&B, pop, rock, classical. Here's a list of each individual song and what I thought:<br />1. Stripped Pt 1 (Intro) - I'm actually digging this intro even though its only 1:40 mins long. It's very confusing and busy... but a good introduction to the rest of the album. 4.5/5<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down - An R&B influenced track featuring Lil Kim.. It's not one of the highlights of the album, but its still a funky song. 4/5<br />3. Walk Away - My favourite song on the album. It has a very bluesy feel to it. Her vocals do the song extreme justice. Every emotion is expressed through the song. Definately 5/5.<br />4. Fighter - Another amazing song. Very rock-ish, expressive and strong. One of the select songs on the album I play over and over again. 5/5<br />5. Primer Amor Interlude - A Spanish interlude... not much to say, but I still like it. 3.5/5<br />6. Infatuation - A funky, Latin-influenced track. Very catchy. Overall a pretty good track. 4/5<br />7. Lovers Embrace Interlude - I actually really like this interlude. Very sweet and flowing.. 4.5/5<br />8. Loving Me For Me - A romantic, emotive song. Not the best song on the album, but still a very good listen. 3.8/5<br />9. Impossible - I personally was expecting more from this song considering Alicia Keys' imput. It's more of a filler... Christina uses good vocals but the song isn't very captivating. 3/5<br />10. Underappreciated - A funky track about relationships becoming taken for granted. I think a lot of people can relate to the message. 4/5<br />11. Beautiful - An inspiring, motivational song. The vocals are very raw, and the song is extremely emotive. 5/5<br />12. Make Over - Christina's attempt at Latin beats cross hard rock. Despite the slightly bizarre combination its still a great listen. 5/5<br />13. Cruz - This is by no means oneof the best songs on the album.. its more of a filler, but its still a good song. 3.9/5<br />14. Soar - One of my favourite songs. This song is very uplifting and inspiring. 5/5<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours - I LOVE this song! It has a very Madonna-Fever kind of feel to it. Very funky backround beats, and her voice manipulates the lyrics very well. 5/5<br />16. Dirrty - This song, despite the raunchy filmclip, is a great effort. It's not particularly meaningful or mature, definately a dance tune, but still extremely listenable. 5/5<br />17. Stripped Pt 2 (Outro) - I love the outros/intros/interludes on this album... they're just as addictive as the songs. 5/5<br />18. A Voice Within - A soft ballad which is pretty good, but I don't find it one of the best songs on the album. 3.5/5<br />19. I'm Ok - A very chilling song. Extremely emotive. 4/5<br />20. Singing My Song - One of my favourites off the album. It's a very positive song and well sung. 5/5<br />Overall 'Stripped' is an amazing album. It's mature, real and expressive in every circumstance. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm not exactly a pop fan either, I just like who I like! That's all! Here's the track review:<br /> Stripped Intro: 5/10 Good for an intro, most intro's like this I give 1 to 3 stars, like Sum 41's.<br /> Can't Hold Us Down: 9/10 Great upbeat song, with Lil' Kim.<br /> Walk Away: 7.5/10 Long slow song, but pretty good!<br /> Fighter: 10/10 My favourite, I LOVE IT!

Great cd, buy it!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Don't let the fact that Princess Mononoke is a cartoon, or from Japan, turn you off to this great movie.  In no way is it childish or Disney-like.  Princess Mononoke is a beautiful film that can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys fantasy.
6304884419|5.0|&quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; is an extremely well done movie with terrific acting and an excellent script.  It depicted the life of a young Italian boy growing with such consideration and sensitivity.  It showed that life is not a dichotomy of good vs. bad, but that life is continium of many different perspectives.  <br />A lot of critics disliked the Jane-Calogero plot, but I really liked it and I thought it added another dimension to the movie.  Their union showed that Lorenzo, depicted as the &quot;good&quot; guy, has his flaws.  In contrast, Sonny, who is depicted as the &quot;bad&quot; guy, shows his wisdom beyond the times (after all, this was set in the late 1960's when interracial union was still very much frowned upon).  <br />And I also thought the awkwardness of Jane and Calogero's courtship was also well done, whether intentionally or not by Mr. De Niro and the actors, Taral Hicks and Lillo Brancato Jr.  These are two sixteen year olds with not much dating experience afterall.  Everything from the uneasiness of their conversations to thier kissing was very realistic and should be given credit.       <br />One thing that I wish could have been explored more but wasn't is more background on Sonny and Lorenzo's feud.  The movie alluded to some bad blood between the two men but was never fully explored.  <BR>But maybe what is left out of the movie is what makes it so great.  <br />All in all, I give this movie five stars.  Excellent directorial debut by Robert De Niro.
B00006F2TV|4.0|This was a good movie and it stayed with the comic book. Except for Mary Jane. His first gf was Gwen and she died on the bridge. I still enjoyed this movie. If you are a fan of Spider-Man then you will enjoy it too.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill was just twenty-something when she released this stunning solo debut -- a recording that far exceeded the previous Fugees' effort. It's basically an R&B record, but there are also flashes of rap, hip-hop, funky and even pop (\\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\") and rock.<br />The music is full of original moments, none of the songs sound alike. Lauryn has defined the style I would call 'biblical rap'. Apart from clever rhymes, her rap intermezzos do not relate usual stuff about sex, drugs or guns, but rather contain profound wisdom based on the Bible and life's experience. Hill shows herself as an insightful observer of the world, showing us all the sensitivity under her smooth surface. And... the songwriting is fantastically varied.<br />Dynamic \\"Lost Ones\\" ranks among her top rap performances. Moving \\"Ex-Factor\\" comes straight out of the heart, full of raw emotion and ending with a great guitar solo by Johari Newton. \\"To Zion\\" is autobiographical, too, touchingly describing the dilemma the girl/artist was facing when about to give life to her child. Guest guitar by Carlos Santana also shines, making the song an all-out drama, along with chants \\"marching, marching, marching to Zion...\\"<br />Of other extraordinary tunes on this opus, \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" has great lyrics (performed uniquely as blend of naturally spoken language, rap and singing). \\"I Used to Love Him\\" features equally brilliant vocal performance by Mary J. Blige. \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is a smoky neo-soul duet with fellow R&B star D'Angelo. Edgy strings on \\"Everything Is Everything\\" work beautifully, as well as hammond organ does on the amazing title track, accompanied by 'delightful' sound cracks, coming as if from an old LP record...<br />Not up to par are \\"Superstar\\" and hidden track \\"Tell Him\\" but the overall potential Lauryn showed here is enormous. Hill's individual artistry is undoubtedly a top priority for her; although I did not like her 2002 \\"Unplugged\\" near as much as her debut, it's still a pretty respectable record, since it shows the musician as her fans know her -- as an independent, African-American female who has much to say. If she would never release anything else, the \\"Miseducation\\" is vastly enough to keep her in the books on popular music.<br />The album is framed by audio scenes as if from a (high?) school, where Lauryn is not present at a lesson and thus misses out on the education. Instead, she offers us her 'miseducation.' Although I was never a truant in my school-years, I would here choose the latter, too.
B00006IR5S|5.0|This soundtrack is brilliant! John Williams has done it again! The music is fantastic and so well performed! You can imagine the scenes of the movie as the movie plays! Fawkes the Pheonix is enchanting! You have to buy it! It's the best music ever! This has to be the best soundtrack of all time!
B00005KHJR|4.0|I first saw this film as a rental from the video store.  It was a dusty sun bleached box sitting at on a bottom shelf.  I'd have to admit I was a little confused about some parts of it when I was done.  It was not till a few years later that I bought the extended edition that I really began to enjoy this movie.  If you are going to buy this make sure you watch the extended edition, everything finally makes sense.  For some reason they felt American audiences would not \\"sit through\\" the regular version so they cut it down.  Anyway, Edward Woodward as the annoying Sergeant Howie does a great job and Christopher Lee is as always a great actor to watch as Lord Summerisle.  Some of the music is quite laughable, especially the song the villagers sing in the pub, but overall it is mostly a fun movie to watch.  Besides is it is a great conversation piece to have in your DVD collection.  The special features are not really that great, although the trailers are quite funny in the fact that they are poorly done, there is also a \\"hidden\\" interview with Christopher Lee which is a very poor picture quality.  The main reason to buy this version over the regular one is the extended edition of the film.
B0000029DD|5.0|Despite what many believe, yes it is possible to wear out a CD! There are only three CDs of my 400 that I have played to the point where they had to be replaced; The Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Siamese Dream\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Houses on the Holy\\", and Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\".<BR>I was introduced to him by a co-worker and budding musician who had discovered him through the internet. He said that he found this MP3 by this \\"dead rock/folk guy\\" and \\"stayed up every night for a week trying to learn to play all the songs.\\" Knowing how talented my co-worker Jim is at guitar (his influences are as eclectic as Michael Hedges and Jimmy Page) I knew I had to take a listen. The sound quality was mediocre and I couldn't focus on anything, so having an extra $10, I went to my local music store and picked up a used copy and sat myself down for a good listening session.<BR>It was weeks before I listened to anything else, and I still find myself choosing it over older favorites when I'm in the car. It's been almost a year and I still can't say that I own an album more satisfying than this one.<BR>I was a little awestruck that I found such delight in a style such as his, since my other purchases of that time were albums by Tool, The White Stripes, and Depeche Mode. More worrying still was what my friends thought about someone who used to be known for my \\"evil\\" wardrobe and my dark and gothic personality listening to uplifting vocal music. Let me tell you, you're not buying Justin Timberlake or Maxwell, here. This is good rock with an unlikely but ironically complimentary vocal accompaniment. It's not just some dreamboy singing about girls, it's a bashful musicial singing about life and loss. Any timidness in his singing should be looked at again after reading \\"Dream Brother: The Lives and Music of Tim and Jeff Buckley\\", which sheds a bit more light on the situation.<BR>He had low self-confidence and most of the people who knew him didn't even know he could sing until he put out an album. He was shy and introverted. You can sense a little more coming out of him in \\"Sketches...\\" where he gets a bit more bold, daring, loud, and testy. Really, the only track that shows his indulgence is \\"Eternal Life\\" during which he truly lets loose with a little rage. There is a highlight during \\"Grace\\" that's worth mentioning, however. After the last vocal refrain when he crescendos orgasmically into a very high and long-endured note like an opera tenor reincarnation of Robert Plant.<BR>It's not quite the vocal acrobatics that his father produced, but his father was an egotist and careerist and spent seven albums building up enough confidence to weigh down his reputation. Had Jeff been given a seven album career, you could expect nothing less from him, though I know he wouldn't have made the same ill choices.<BR>It was a bit moody for someone like me who is usually just in the mood for something to have in the background while I relax. It's impossible to keep this in the backgroud because it keeps coming forward with some incredible note or lyric that slips into your mind when you least expect it and reminds you that it's there. It also doesn't do a good job of relaxing me because I always feel envigorated and renewed after hearing this music. It's like going in for a Shi-atzu and getting a colonic by mistake; still helpful, but in a different way.<BR>There's something in this album for everyone to enjoy. The accompanying band is so harmonic that it makes me wish that they were all still together somewhere, even without Jeff. Jeff's guitar work is haunting for a fusion-influenced folk artist like himself. It's like nothing I've ever heard before. It's not like a roaring classic rock solo, but it's so acoustic and soul-searching that it doesn't have to be. This isn't guitar-solo music. His style fits it all so well. It's rare that you see a band that is so complete. Fair warning, however. This album may change the way you see music.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana is still going strong, and now she presents us with her first live album. Her rendition of 'Deed I Do' is breathtaking and 'Devil may Care' is just as it should be: fast, furious and funny.<BR> My only complaint? It should be bigger. But oh well, here's waiting for more albums, Diana.
B00001IVOF|5.0|this is mobb deeps best album this album was there last really raw album they were hungry when they drop this one the best songs on here are bloodsport,drop a gem on em,extortion,man down(here come the vultures) cant get enough of it, hell on earth, get dealt wit,apostles warning the song nighttime vultures is a gothic masterpiece the whole album is truly a classic
B00001OH1S|5.0|Thomas Crown himself would have picked these same songs. 'Sinnerman' by Nina Simone is the perfect song to be featured in the climax of the movie. Sting's rendition of 'The windmills of your mind' is nice. Basically, a very good soundtrack that you won't be able to get out of your CD player.

B00004SCX6|5.0|She is So great because she really opened the way for female artists. She has such great songs as well and this album really prooves it. I love \\"Oops I Did it Again\\" \\"Stronger\\" \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the last to know\\" It is a great album and i think everybody should add it to there CD collection.
B000060MMI|5.0|This CD absolutely catches the full weight of the Celt-Punk genre in full force! It exemplifies the &quot;Mollies&quot; at their best. The vocals are drenched with that killer celtic lilt in the ballads, and you can definately hear the celtic pride in the hard stuff. If you are into the Celtic-Punk stuff or just are into anything with a touch of Guiness, this CD is for you!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This Album is one of The best Britney Spears CD's Because of the following Songs on the album \\"I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\" and the other songs are great Too. I think Britney Spears is the best singer no matter what other people say i have loved her music ever since her first album \\"...Baby One More Time\\" came out. I think if you love Britney Spears you should get this album.
B00005MP58|5.0|The best of the updated Austen works. The acting is supberb. Colin Firth is one of the best actors of his generation. You feel every emotion with his Mr Darcy throughout this film. <BR>I cannot count the number of times I have looked at this series. <BR>I favorite movie ever!
B000002LND|5.0|This is an awesome album because it features a lot of Madonna's hit songs such as &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Justify My love&quot; To name a few. I think if you like Madonna you will Love this album.
1559408855|5.0|Pasolini applies his craft as an amazing poet to the medium of film.  A brilliant artist, Pasolini explores the calculations and fantasies behind the sadistic decadence of fascism.  This film is a traumatic voyage through unconsensual sadism, betrayal, and murder.  The dramatic cimematography provokes a strong empathetic response to the degradations of the prisoners and is a difficult experience to get through.  However, this is far more than a shocking film bordering on snuff.  Pasolini conveys a warning not only about fascism but the ugly side of human survival where in extreme situations, conformity is pursued instead of martyrdom.
B000002GI0|4.0|I bought this cd for the incredible song that Emmylou Harris covered - 'Icy Blue Heart'. That song alone puts John Hiatt up there with the best singer songwriters. As a bonus I also got top tracks like: 'Drive South', 'Sometime Other Than Now', 'Ride Along', 'Slow Turning', 'Is Anybody There' & 'Feels Like Rain'. I also highly recommend the previous album: 'Bring The Family', for more gems like: 'Memphis In The Meantime', 'Lipstick Sunset' & 'Learning How To Love You'. The bonus on that album is you get Ry Cooder, Jim Keltner & Nick Lowe in the band, and you can't ask for more than that.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you like blues and folk mixtures this is a CD for you.  I had been singing the praises of Eve Cassidy's CD Songbird to some friends and they instantly ran out to the car and threw a copy of Norah Jones at me.  Never having ever heard of Norah before I was very pleasantly suprised.  A great chill out CD, in front of the fire with good friends and a great wine.
B000001GJU|5.0|In his final days Herbert von Karajan was just crankin' 'em out, sometimes his third or fourth reading of a certain piece, just to try and get as much of his repertoire recorded digitally as possible.  This recording - which was also used for one of his Telemondial video productions - is one of those.  The Vienna Philharmonic the ensemble used this time after his fallout with the Berliners shortly before.  I've had older renditions of this work on vinyl recorded with the Berlin Phil that were quite exceptional.  I've always thought, why not just digitally re-master a 20 or 30-year-old recording from the late 50's through the early 70's when he was really in his prime, as opposed to issuing another rendition just to make a digital version of it?  Nonetheless, these are still very fine readings of The Dvorak and the Smetana, and after reviewing a library copy, I would still be tempted to buy myself one of this 1985 issue just for the sound quality alone.  The Deutsche Grammophon Original-Image Bit-Processing digital sound on this recording will blow you away.
B00006M183|5.0|I really don't understand all the negative reviews of this album.  Sure, it may be hard to grasp at times, but that only makes it more interesting and gives it more replay value.  I didn't think this was a mellow album AT ALL.  The band really shows their ability to rock out on this album.  Every song is a winner, with the mellow \\"Thumbing My Way\\" snagging one of the top spots.  It's a really pretty song with top-notch vocals and lyrics from Ed Vedder.  If anything, his lyrics are getting better and better with each album(with perhaps the exception of Binaural, a horribly disappointing album).  They aren't quite as ambiguous as on some previous albums; they have a little more of a straight-forward approach.  Ed even borrows a line from Lennon and McCartney on \\"Love Boat Captain\\" by saying \\"all you need is love\\".  Sure, it's a simple statement, but sometimes simplicity can be more effective and appropriate than complexity.  I mean, if these guys wrote lyrics as complex as Fugazi all the time, people would get sick of it.  I think this is a great direction for PJ, moving away from the melodically empty sounds of Binaural.  If you're looking for the sound contained in the band's radio hits like \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Alive\\", and \\"Daughter\\", then look somewhere else.  I'm not dissing the band's earlier work, but it really is miraculous to see the progression taking place.  All of the members are top-notch: Ed's vocals are most definitely Ed, and sound as soulful as ever, Mike and Stone are AMAZING, playing riffs and licks that fit the atmosphere of each song perfectly, Jeff creates a channeling underbelly with his wide array of bass guitars, and Matt proves himself a good PJ drummer/percussionist after a disappointing performance on the last album.  But hey, as Ed says in \\"Thumbing my Way\\": no matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead.  Even after the devastation of the band members from seeing fans trampled to death trying to rush the stage at a show in Denmark during the Binaural Tour, they have flourished and prospered.  They continue to impress, and their future seems to have no end.  Maybe they'll save America from Disturbed, Staind, Linkin Park, Saliva, Puddle of Mudd, etc.  Keep growing your mohawk, Ed.  Looks good on ya.
0375414053|5.0|I started reading this book on an airplane and laughed all the way home!  Since then, I have purchased several copies as gifts.  This novel is so painfully funny that you will forget that it is not a true story.  Kate Reddy is the totally honest alter ego of all of us who work two jobs with great intensity.  Don't bother buying this for the stay-at-home moms.  This book is definitely intended for those of us who work in traditional male environments while trying to raise our children (and spouses) and maintain what little is left of our sanity!
1573222038|4.0|sarah waters is a genius. fans of her first two novels will be equally taken with this, her third offering. unlike gregory maguire's creative vision, which seems to have lost a little steam after the spellbinding _wicked_, waters' universe of theives, rogues, lesbians, ingenues, scallywags, mystics, orphans, loons and vaudvilleans remains as fresh and captivating as it was in _tipping the velvet_ and _affinity_.  while descriptions  of sexual situations and bodily functions are discussed more frankly than they would have been in a true victorian novel, her attention to details is mindboggling. and, while this is the author's longest work, to date, the reader is more likely to fret about running out of pages than having to read another. go get this book.
B00004XMV6|4.0|Mickey Was his wonderfull romantic self in 9 1/2 and it made as a good &quot;fall in love movie&quot;.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Back in May when I first saw Spider-man, my jaw dropped at the incredible graphics, acting, story, and emotion put into this comic book brought to life movie. I saw the movie 2 more times in theaters, then rushed and bought the DVD on opening week (sold out the first few days). After viewing everything, here's what I thought:<BR>First off, the movie: I loved this movie, and is one of the top 3 of my favorites ever! The story goes a lot with the old comic books. A kid by the name of Peter Parker is the main character. Through his whole life, he has had a crush on a girl next door named Mary Jane. He's always been a bit shy and for that matter; geeky and never really talked to her. On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a geneticly enganeered spider. The spider gives him super-human powers like a spider, and he doesn't know what to do with them. That's when one night, his uncle (he lives with his aunt and uncle) is shot by a burglar and dies on the very street. That's when Peter knows who he must become. He uses his abilities (web sling, incredible strength, and super-human speed and senses) to fight evil. His first openant: his uncle's killer. From that day on, Spider-man must fight off evil. A trully great start.<br />Now, after getting his powers, a person (a few miles away) by the name of Norban Osborne is testing a human enhancer drug. The drug makes his mind go mad, and while he does get the enhancers affects, he also gets a criminals attitude. The whole movie is basicly these two fighting. Pretty boring right? No, not at all. Because the villain (green goblain) is willing to do anything to win, and in this case, finds out Spider-man's true identity and...you'll have to see.<br />What made this movie so great was A. The romance between Mary Jane and Spider-man and wonderful acting all around and B. Perhaps the best graphics ever seen in a movie. Everything seems so real that you can't really tell it's special affects. I, toward the end of the movie, really felt like it was possible (which it really isn't). Like there could be a Spider-man out there somewhere. The city landscacpes and swinging is just incredible. Explosions, realism, web, destruction, everything makes this movie so real and exciting...<br />So if u like a good romance, lots of action, incredible graphics, and a ton of fighting (with a little humor) Spider-man is for u. Millions of people did not flock to theaters again and again for nothing. This was a great movie, with a great ending that sets up for...should I give it away?...Spider-Man 2 (set for realease about 2004)<br />The extras: Tons! The making of the movie, messups, a free demo of the PC game of Spider-man, staff thoughts, and a lot lot more. This DVD was awsome, and brings u the blockbuster hit that rocked theaters all over the world last summer. <br />Overall, u should get this DVD. For the movie, the extras, and because of just how good it is. If your still not convinced, rent it on video. Then you'll c y u have to get Spider-man: The Movie; a classic of the future (in my opinion). <br />I hope this helped, and I know that I love and can't get enough of Spider-man
B00005221M|1.0|The director's cut is exactly that, it cut some of the dialogue and the Clannad musical score. The movie it self is great just not this version.I have both versions on DVD. I watch the Theatrical version. To much has been cut out of the Directors Cut.The only good addition to the Directors Cut version is the closeing speech. It's worth getting a region free DVD player or DVD X Player for your computer so you can watch this and other movies you cann't get here in the U.S.. I shop Amazon.co.uk to find movies you cann't get here.
B00006CXXU|2.0|20 tracks of angst and poor pitiful me.  Which is unfortunate -- yeah yeah, you're so put upon.  The production is excellent, the musicianship outstanding and Christina is in great voice.   Might be best for her to give up writing her own stuff until there is actually some life to write about.
6304007523|5.0|This the best movie ever in my opinion.  It is about a club boxer from the slums of Philly in 1976. The boxer Rocky, is a high school drop out going nowhere. The heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed is going to fight in Philly to celebrate the Bicentenial anniversary of the US. When his opponent drops out of the fight, Apollo decides to fight a local nobody. Because of his nickname, The Italian Stalion, Rocky is chosen.  When he finds out Rocky starts a brutal training program.  In the end Rocky fights Apollo to the end, and he loses narowly by decision.
B00003CY0V|2.0|After the reviews I was expecting a really good movie.  So much for hopes.  I give this movie a middle rating only because there are some great special effects and there is enough action going on to keep it entertaining.  It falls in the rental category under \\"something to watch when the wife/girlfriend is out\\".<br />Berry's boob scene was mostly embarrassing.  If she is going to pose semi nude in a film, the least she could do is insist that the situation at least has something to do with the actual plot, I mean it is supposed to be a movie.  There is a scene in the film in which she is in her underwear that actually does play into the plot of the movie and makes sense being in the film.  And by the way, note to producers, she is infinitely more sexy in this scene than in the bare breast shot.<br />The one great special effect sequence in this movie is well worth watching and perhaps gives this one an extra star.  It would recommend this movie when you are in the mood for a simple guys film, entertaining but nothing special.
B000067DNC|5.0|I am very pleased that MGM finally decided to bring these out on DVD.  I always wanted to own perfect quality, commercial free episodes of one of the most original sci-fi shows around.  Stargate had a special chemistry and story between the actors just like Star Trek TNG did.  A true classic to own and watch later in life.
B00006CJOY|5.0|I grew up in Europe listening to Mano Negra, and i must say after almost 10 years in the US i had forgotten all about it, until i found Radio Bemba Sound System at my local record store. It brought back some nice memories. Since then i never leave the house without it. It's so full of energy, and it's every contagious, you'll find yourself addicted to the beat. If you can catch Manu Chao live someday, don't miss that opportunity. You won't regret it. Mano Negra was such a phenomenon around the world, it's a little sad American never got the chance to fully experiance the live shows.
B00000K3CR|4.0|In a decade which everyone could do without (If George Bush wasn't president, we know Bush Jr. wouldn't be), Big came along and we got a glimpse of the future cinema which is yet to occur.  Tom Hanks is an awsome actor and the script was amazing.  I won't ever let what happened to him happen to me, only because I'm 18.  But, if I was 12 I'd do everything he did and of course get Sadaam so that we wouldn't have the Stupid War.  If you don't listen to me amuse myself than just get this movie.  If you do, you can read my other reviews.
B000060OFT|5.0|Not only is this movie based on the greatest love story of all times, but this take on it is unbelievable. Baz Luhrmann uses his own style to show and present this movie, and the modern approach is amazing. It is as visually captivating as a movie can get. This movie is great and I highly recommend it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|While I thought this movie was very intertaining, I couldn't help but want to compare it to Shrek.  Whether that was a fair expectation or not, I don't know, but I give both movies a 5, even though I'd pick Shrek as the better of the two.<br />My 18 month old daughter was maybe a bit nervous with the opening scene, but that soon ended as this movie certainly isn't frightening, but instead is humorous and lots of fun to watch.<br />The computer has come a long way and the animation in this movie is beyond great, it represents what I think computer generated movies should be.  If movie makers try and take computer generation along the route that Final Fantasy took, then eventually we'll have computer generated movies that look like live action movies, what would be the point?<br />I think the way these &quot;monsters&quot; were made to look like and take on human characterists was fabulous, especially since they didn't look human at all.  The little girl in the film was very well done and her interaction with the monsters was handled expertly.<br />I didn't bother to rent this one, I bought it right away.  I know we'll enjoy it for a long time.  A strong recommendation.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stays faithful to the popular book which inspired it (though sometimes a little too faithful), and creates a magical film that everyone in the family can enjoy.<br />Bringing the text of J.K. Rowling alive is an excellent cast and superbly designed set and props. Without any major changes or exclusions, fans of the books along with those un-read in the adventures of Harry Potter should enjoy this flick. The celluloid world authentically feels like the words Rowling wrote. Daniel Radcliffe is great as Potter, and the young actors playing Ron and Hermione are equally as astonishing. But it's the late Richard Harris who is most notable, perfectly cast as Dumbledore the headmaster. The wisdom in his eyes reflects the genius of the head wizard.<br />The one flaw this film has, however, is its straightforward adaptation. With hardly any changes made from the book, the film seems too rushed and crowded with characters and events. When adapting from a book, the movie should take scenes and characters that work in the transfer to the different medium, and change events or scenes that don't work. That which works in a book, doesn't necessarily work in a movie. Comparing this to Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, which came out at the same time and is another fantasy adaptation, it's easy to see that Potter wasn't quite as successful in the adaptation process as that movie, which knew what it had to change and delete in order to make it work on the big screen.<br />But despite that problem, this film still works as a whole. It's magical, beautiful and perfect for the whole family. Kids will love seeing their favorite characters come alive and see first hand the wonderful world of Harry Potter.
B00006G8LB|1.0|The only reason this got any stars (at all) was for the direction, and I suppose a couple of the characters. The story was lackluster.I wasn't really pulled in to it and I'm a big Marvel fan.  Kirsten Dunst was unconvincing,of which pails in comparison to her Virgin Suicides performance.  Simmons performance as Jonah Jameson was enjoyable. I wont go into this to much further other than to say that if it weren't for Mr. Raimi this film would be a wash. Totally forgetable. DISSAPOINTING!!  I hope whoever, does a better job with the Fantastic Four and The Hulk.
0807205567|5.0|Sabriel is my favorite book I have ever read. Garth Nix is a genius in writing this amazing book about a young girl named Sabriel. I cannot wait until the third book in the series.
0140277447|4.0|In this book, Iris Chang recounts the story of the Rape of Nanking, the main incident that drives a wedge of enmity between the Japanese and Chinese to this day. When Japanese soldiers descended on Nanking, they slaughtered, in cold blood, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. The book was so \\"to the point\\" in its horror(pictures of piles of bodies and severed heads included) that it made me want to throw up. I think the book did a good job in describing an event that very few people in the West know of. It is just right in the amount of disgust and types of emotions it evokes in people. However, it could have been more exciting, vivid, and explored some segments more deeply. Totally too gruesome for children, but the rest of us owe it to ourselves to read it, and attempt to prevent such things from happening later.<br />In response for all those people who ask why Chang doesn't give us a lecture on the atrocity of A-bombs or other incidents against humanity, her story was not about the Holocaust, or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We cannot deny that these were horrendous as well, but we must also, when faced with the evidence, deal with the fact that the Japanese did in fact do this, and put aside for a moment whether or not Chang is biased. By arguing about the number of people who were killed or whether Chang is being unfair, we are only muting the voices of the victims. The most important thing is to realize that one isolated event cannot be used to judge an entire nation, nor should it be forgotten.
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah brings true joy and peace to all who listen to this beautiful album.  You can feel the spirituality and sincerity in her voice as she takes the opportunity to share her love of Christmas and God.  This CD is ALWAYS in my CD player during the holidays and everyone I know has a copy.
B00006LHYC|3.0|Like other female singers who have tried to make it in the English music market and had some nominal success, Laura shows a slight accent, and doesn't have the power and passion she exhibits when singing in her native language. The two songs here that I enjoyed also happened to be originally released in Italian. I bought this CD to complete my Laura Pausini collection, but I won't be listening to it as much as I will continue listening to her Italian language CDs.
0060930187|4.0|having suffered from clinical depression myself, i found this book an exceptional piece of work in the sense that plath described esthers feelings so brilliantly that i could relate to it all on such a personal level. the descriptions she used were not too different from the ways in which i had attempted to describe my feelings at a point in time, however the poetry of her prose is brilliant. whilst reading the book, i commented to others that it is inevitable that plath had to have experienced these issues herself because there is no other way she would have been able to use descriptions the way she has. only after having checked out her website now, i realise this is true. the thing that destressed me a bit is the fact that the term &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; is used too broadly as far as i am concerned. perhaps this is due to the date of publishing in the 1960s where psychiatry was not as advanced as it is today...its seems more to me that esther was suffering a serious mood disorder (a chemical imbalance) more than anything else.<BR>i found the end a bit disappointing aswell, it was unclear what the outcome of all her treatment was and i was looking forward to reading about the long term results of what happened to her.<BR>this book comes highly recomended for anyone who enjoys narrative novels and especially fans of j.d salingers &quot;catcher in the rye&quot;. i found the similarity uncanny...<BR>enjoy ( if thats that possible?)!
0440237688|4.0|The book 'The Giver' was a book that could tech you lessons. It was a type of book that you had to pay attention to so that you could understand the meaning and the lessons that we going on throughout the whole book. I thought that it was intesting at some parts because you had to really go back and think about what you were reading. What i really thought was intesting and yet neat at the same time was that Jonas could interperate these memories that the Giver had, and also being able to say the word before The Giver told him what it was.(p.85) <br />Like i was saying the book really makes you want to think about all these questions that run through your mind...like \\" Is this possibly what the future really holds,\\" or \\" If it is the future then how will it start and when will it start.\\" Just different questions ran through my mind about some of the things. This book overall was a pretty good book! I think that it could have a different ending to it, but if that is the way that Lois Lowry wants to end it then i guess she can.<BR>                     7.3 MB
B00006RAKP|4.0|With all due respect to Michael Jackson, I always believed that Elton John is more deserving of the title &quot;King of Pop.&quot;  Both performers have endured their share of artistic and personal ups and downs, but while Jacko has recently morphed into self-parody, Sir Elton still churns out freshly-crafted pop (as evidenced on his excellent &quot;Songs from the West Coast&quot;).  I'm excited as the next Elton fan that we now have a double-disc greatest hits album spanning his entire career, but let's be honest: it's not as comprehensive as it could have been.  There are enough omissions on this recording to warrant a third disc: &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; &quot;Empty Garden,&quot; &quot;A Word in Spanish,&quot; &quot;In Neon,&quot; &quot;Kiss the Bride,&quot; and so forth.  Also, the disc completely ignores the albums &quot;Victim of Love&quot; and &quot;Leather Jackets,&quot; which is a smart move since both records were easily among his least inspired.  But moving on, the material that DOES surface on this collection is, for the most part, mind-blowingly good.  Disc 1, which covers the 1970s, is utter perfection, a snapshot of classic, vintage Elton in peak form.  &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Daniel,&quot; &quot;Tiny Dancer,&quot; &quot;Somebody Saved My Life Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Rocket Man&quot; form ample evidence that Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin were among the best songwriting teams of the 1970s.  Disc 2 (which covers 1980-2002) has some good stuff, but it's easily the lesser disc which has some decent tunes as well as a handful of not-so-great ones.  &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot; is still a winning tale of perseverence, while &quot;Sad Songs,&quot; &quot;I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues,&quot; and &quot;Little Jeannie&quot; also stand out, too.  However, I wasn't a big fan of his work for &quot;The Lion King,&quot; and personally wasn't fond of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; and &quot;Circle of Life.&quot;  However, this disc closes on a great note with &quot;I Want Love&quot; and &quot;This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore,&quot; which are from 2001's &quot;Songs from the West Coast.&quot;  The limited edition has 4 tracks; the best of which is the live version of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; (NOT the tribute to Princess Diana) and his duet with George Michael &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.&quot;  Overall, I'm impressed with this hits collection, which comes with some really cool liner notes and nice photographs from his early years.  For a one stop guide to Elton's work, &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002&quot; is the way to go, warts and all.es on a great note with &quot;I Want Love&quot; and &quot;This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore,&quot; which are from 2001's &quot;Songs from the West Coast.&quot;  The limited edition has 4 tracks; the best of which is the live version of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; (NOT the tribute to Princess Diana) and his duet with George Michael &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.&quot;  Overall, I'm impressed with this hits collection, which comes with some really cool liner notes and nice photographs from his early years.

B00005OWIU|4.0|2001 was an unusually light year for John Williams, with only two scores to his credit: Steven Spielberg's &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot; and Chris Columbus's &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; Although &quot;A.I.&quot; may be a more serious film than &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; don't think that Williams treated the film as just a simple child's movie. From the opening celesta solo of the &quot;Prologue&quot; to the final crashing chords of &quot;Hedwig's Theme,&quot; the &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; album features Williams at his finest. Dispersed throughout the album, Williams introduces several themes that will undoubtedly be used in the sequels he scores. The principal theme of the score is &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot;, primarily voiced with celesta solos (expertly done by Randy Kerber). The theme appears in various tracks with different instrumentation, often only for a few notes as more of a motif than a theme. The second theme, best referred to as &quot;Harry's Theme&quot;, appears both in sweeping string passages (the middle of &quot;The Arrival of Baby Harry&quot;) and in moments of quiet reflection (&quot;Leaving Hogwarts&quot;). There is also the light &quot;Flying Theme&quot;, a wonderful woodwind piece that appears in &quot;Mr. Longbottom Flies&quot; and other tracks in various forms.<BR>Other tracks worth noting include &quot;Diagon Alley&quot;, a wonderful piece for what sounds like Pan flute and violin that seems to be missing from the final cut of the film, &quot;Hogwarts Forever!&quot;, a very dissonant piece for horn quartet, and &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot;, a suite of themes from the score that appears during the film's end credits. The score's darker side appears in &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot;, featuring a heavy brass exposition of &quot;Voldemort's Theme.&quot; Another track, &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot;, provides wonderful action underscoring featuring a wonderful brass fanfare.<BR>Overall, Williams's score serves its purpose, although it seems to lack some of the magic in some of his previous films of the fantasy genre, such as &quot;Hook&quot; and &quot;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.&quot; However, John Williams's genius still makes this album an enjoyable listening experience that one will want to repeat again and again. I certainly haven't tired of it yet.
0066620996|3.0|The book is very well researched and reads very smoothly. At 210 pages, \\"Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap and Others Don't\\" reads very quickly. Jim Collins writes in a clear, concise style that uses effective analogies to get his points across. But I gained little from reading this book. The insights are good but not great, they are simply not new. The road to greatness according to Jim Collins is:<br />1. Get the right people<BR>2. Set the right goals<BR>3. Execute relentlessly<br />The data mining exercise that Jim Collins put his team through yielded few surprising results, and whatever useful lessons can be drawn from the exercise I can summarize in 10 pages. This is a deep quackery, another \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" for people who spend all day in meetings trading consultant speak, thinking they're working and \\"adding value\\".
0671646788|5.0|Dr. Schwartz's book drives home the message that the size of a person's success is directly proportional to the size of their thinking. In Schwartz's words, \\"Case history after case history proved that the size of bank accounts, the size of happiness accounts, and the size of one's general satisfaction account is dependent on the size of one's thinking.\\"<br />The Magic Of Thinking Big is perhaps the easiest-reading personal growth book ever written.

B00000DQSZ|5.0|The title track to Kraftwerk's 1977 LP is among the most influential and vital singles of the modern era. It's a hauntingly beautiful exercise in electronic minimalism, stripped down to eerie synths, crisp drum machines, and a seductive monotone vocal. When it segues into the next track \\"Metal on Metal,\\" with its click-clack beats, the recording approaches its very climax. \\"Trans Europe Express\\" was released in an era when disco was hitting its peak in popularity and while classic rock bands like Boston were ruling airwaves. Its arrival may have stuck out like a sore thumb, and naysayers may dismiss the album as cold, detatched, and synthetic. But the truth remains that this album, a classic in its own right, is the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" of electronic music, and it deserves to be on as high a pedestal as any beloved rock and roll album. It was powerful enough to transcend many barriers, including hip hop, as Afrika Bambatta stole the title track's synth line for the single \\"Planet Rock.\\" Beautiful and attention-grabbing in every which way, \\"Trans Europe Express\\" is a classic that's also essential listening.
B00006IR5S|5.0|One often wonders how John Williams is consistently able to take themes from his previous films and incorporate them into his new scores in fresh, enchanting new ways. Williams has certainly done all this and more with his score for &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, the sequel to last year's blockbuster &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;<BR>Unable to complete the score to &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; on his own due to previous commitments with George Lucas's &quot;Star Wars: Episode II&quot; and Steven Spielberg's &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, William Ross was brought in to adapt the new themes Williams had created for the film as well as to supply a large number of underscore based on Williams's material. The collaboration was very much a success, and this album is proof of it.<BR>&quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a much darker film than &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, and the CD is full of cues that are much darker than cues from the previous album. As conducted by Ross and performed by the unparalleled London Symphony Orchestra, the score for &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is one of the most original and best sounding scores I have heard in a long time.<BR>The album begins with &quot;Prologue: Book II and The Escape From the Dursleys&quot;. This track features a compilation of many of the themes from &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, beginning with &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; on celesta (once again played by Randy Kerber), then transistioning into the music from &quot;The Arrival of Baby Harry&quot; on the last album. The &quot;Flying Theme&quot; and &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot; round out the familiar themes in this track, which provides a wonderful re-introduction to the world of Harry Potter and John Williams.<BR>The next track, &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot;, is a wonderful new theme that has an uplifting feel similar to &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot;. Track 3, &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot;, is appropriately dark, ending with chords punctuated by heavy trumpets.<BR>&quot;Gilderoy Lockhart&quot;, the theme for the pompous, arrogant character of the same name, is an appropriately pompous, arrogant track. The use of harpsichord gives this theme a sort of stuck-up Baroque feel that is perfect for Lockhart's character.<BR>Other tracks worth noting include &quot;Fawkes Is Reborn&quot;, featuring the &quot;Fawkes The Phoenix Theme&quot; from track 2. &quot;Meeting Tom Riddle&quot; features a prominent reindition of &quot;Voldemort's Theme&quot; from &quot;Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; &quot;Cakes for Crabbe and Goyle&quot; is an amusing, light cue featuring bassoon and pizzicato strings.<BR>&quot;Reunion of Friends&quot; brings back many of the themes we know and love, ending with a triumphant version of &quot;Harry's Theme&quot; similar to the end of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;<BR>With &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Williams has once again brought to life the world of Harry Potter in a way no other composer can. Although it probably won't win the Academy Award, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a very good score and belongs in the collection of any John Williams fan.
0375823360|1.0|Read the first two books and throw the third away. In The Golden Compass, the first book of the Dark materials trilogy, Philip Pullman proves that he can tell a great story. The characters are engaging, the plot is interesting, the action exciting. The second book, The Subtle Knife, is only fair. The action continues, but the plot is obviously just keeping time until the third book, and the (too) numerous new characters are flat. The third book, The Amber Spyglass, reads like a rough draft, one that should have been thrown away. It is worse than not worth the paper it's printed on.<br />In the third book, the plot is building toward two related climaxes: a battle between the forces of good and evil on the scale of Milton's Paradise Lost; and a more personal, individual quest to preserve \\"Dust,\\" the cause of consciousness in the universe. After a buildup of nearly three books, the best Pullman can do with his epic battle is to have a couple of humans drag the leader of the evil angels into a hole. Then, the universe is saved from a total loss of consciousness when the 2 13-year-old protagonists realize they are in love and--it is implied--have sex. Writing doesn't get any worse than that.
6302409365|5.0|This has got to be THE funniest and most creative movie out there. It's the perfect wierd family that secretly we all want to be part of. They don't care what anyone thinks and have fun being themselves. I mean, if you think about it, they do everything exactly opposite of how we do things, and their lives are so much better. Bravo to the director, bravo to the cast. U gotta get it or at least see it. It is defenetly worth it, and it deserves way higher than a 5! It should get a 10 out of 5!
B00006V9A0|4.0|Eight years since Kurt Cobain's death and following a nasty legal battle, we finally have \\"Nirvana,\\" a straightforward collection of the band's most popular songs, including one previously unreleased track \\"You Know You're Right.\\"  Frankly, I had reservations about this track, and I feared that it would be an unfinished, lackluster song that was probably better off left in the vault.  Much to my surprise, the track works, and it's just as good as anything off \\"Nevermind,\\" in my opinion.  The rest of \\"Nirvana,\\" pulled from their previous albums, remind us why were so lucky to have had this tremendous band in our lives.  Of course, there's the signature hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" but there's also the excellent \\"Been a Son,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" \\"In Bloom,\\" and the semi-controversial \\"Rape Me.\\"  The material on this album has been remastered, and the sound projects at full force on each of these songs.  But as brilliant as the stuff on \\"Nirvana\\" is, I have to dock a star for its brevity.  At 49 minutes, it doesn't really give an in-depth look inside the band.  Like most diehard Nirvana fans, I'd suggest to the casual listener to get Nirvana's individual albums instead.  But if you have to have one album, I suppose this will do.  The final verdict?  \\"Nirvana\\" is short, but sweet.
B0000028VT|5.0|This is one of her best albums to date!  I love this album because it's from her early days, when she actually sang songs with meaning and fully utilized her voice, instead of just humming along with her rappers and backup singers.  If you want old school Mariah, this is a good choice!  I know it's overruled by ballads, but Mariah does a good job at singing them with emotion and making them actually stand out from each other!  No two songs sound the same!  This is one of the very few CD's where I love each and every song!
B000003NA4|5.0|Diana has a lovely voice, well suited to these romantic songs, but she is also a brilliant pianist, although this latter skill is more obvious on the very different, upbeat King Cole Trio tribute album. This album creates it's own mood - if you aren't in the mood for love when you start playing it, you surely will by the end.<br />The songs are mostly from the thirties and forties (a characteristic of all Diana's albums to date), beginning with All or nothing at all, an American number one for Frank Sinatra in 1943.<br />Diana also does brilliant covers of songs which were originally American hits for Peggy Lee (I don't know enough about you, 1946), Fred Astaire (They can't take that away from me, 1937), I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you (Bing Crosby, 1933), You're getting to be a habit with me (Bing Crosby, 1934), How deep is the ocean (in 1932, three different versions were top ten American hits - Guy Lombardo, Paul Whiteman and Rudy Vallee), Garden in the rain (Gene Austin, 1929) and Shep Fields (That old feeling, 1937).<br />Of course, some of those singers and bands have long since been forgotten even in their homeland, while others have been immortalised. Diana's covers of these great songs, nicely updated for today's music fans, demonstrates their enduring quality.<br />I largely ignored jazz music and the Great American Songbook before I discovered Diana's music. This was the album that changed everything for me - I have since become a huge fan of Peggy Lee and Claire Martin, among many others.<br />Thank you, Diana.
0380789035|3.0|As is often true, winning the Hugo OR the Nebula (not both) means 'pretty good but not super'.  The story of Shadow and his decent into the world 'backstage' is a little rough at first.  Held over from his work in comics, Gaiman tries to force feed you scene after scene of the astonishing and bizarre underbelly of the forgotten gods in the New World.  If you manage to make it through this early shockfest, the main character actually ends up growing on you and you begin to hope the best for our friend Shadow, who gets dragged further and further into this chaotic world that he never knew existed.  It feels like a story (with a little imagination) that could happen to anyone; that is until Gaiman gives us a reason for it (which I don't think was needed) and then rushes to finish up the story in the last 50 pages or so.  In short, I went from skeptical before reading, to disturbed early in the reading, to comfortable and enjoying the story for nearly all the rest.  The ending however made me feel very cheated, which puts this book in the average category for me.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|As a movie soundtrack, \\"8 Mile\\" is not the best, especially since only a few of the songs appear in the movie.  Eminem, of course, contributes the best tracks and this time from the prespective of his \\"Rabbit\\" character instead of \\"Slim Shady\\", which adds a new dimension to Em's already powerful MC arsenal.  The problem is the rest of the artists give an uneven contribution.  Even the rap heavyweights are disappointing at times.     LOSE YOURSELF-You've problably heard this 100 times by now.  It's still great;  a different and more inspirational track than Em's other commercial hits.  (5/5)     LOVE ME-An odd semi-love song.  The funniest verse comes from 50 Cent.  (3.5/5)     8 MILE-More than just the movie's title.  A terrific 6-minute escape-from-home rant from Em and perfect for the film.  My favorite track.  I liked this even better than \\"Lose Yourself\\".  (5/5)      ADRENALINE RUSH-I hated this.  Em's protege' Obie Trice, who contributed a really disgusting verse in \\"Drips\\", does no better here.  An empty diss of whomever ....  Obie's track on the bonus sampler is much better than this.  (0/5)      PLACES TO GO-To me, 50 Cent shows much more potential than Obie.  He has a more laid back style in his delivery.  Pretty smooth track and fitting for the movie.  (4/5)     RAP GAME-Pretty amusing track from D12.  Funniest moment is Em rapping in Pig Latin.  (3.5/5)      8 MILES AND RUNNIN'-Okay track from Jay-Z & Freeway, but it sounds like an ad for \\"Blueprint 2\\".  (3/5)      SPIT SHINE-So-so rant from Xzibit.  He been more forceful in his previous work.  (2.5/5)      TIME OF MY LIFE-Sure, this song is out of place, but I still liked it.  (4/5)      U WANNA B ME-Normally, Nas is one of the more deep, thought-provoking rappers around, especially in songs like \\"One Mic\\", but he's completely wasted here.  This is an idiotic, unnecessary dis of Jay-Z, or whomever.  Truly awful.  (0.5/5)      WANKSTA-50 Cent's first single from his upcoming album \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\".  Pretty good, but I liked \\"Places to Go\\" better.  (3/5)        WASTING MY TIME-Just as out of place as the Macy Gray song, but much less memorable.  A waste of your time.  (1.5/5)      R.A.K.I.M.-Rather dull and not very bounceable.  (2/5)     THAT'S MY N***A FO' REAL-So-so filler track.  (2/5)      BATTLE-Pretty good gangsta track.  (3.5/5)      RABBIT RUN-Awesome conclusion to the soundtrack from Em, who takes you inside the head of an aspiring rapper and his creative struggles.  Yet another new dimension from Eminem.  (5/5)      The best tracks from the sampler come from Em, 50, and Obie. The start of \\"Rap Name\\", of course, started Em's hit single \\"Without Me\\" and the chorus samples the hook from \\"Drips\\"        So I was impressed with Eminem and underwhelmed with the rest of the artists.  However Eminem's contributions are great enough to buy the album.  You can skip some of the rest.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Well... The guys at the cinemateque said it must be a bad film. But I was curious and I went to check it out. God, they were so wrong! What a funny film!<br />This is the story of a (so called) dumb blonde who is not only smart but also full of pizzazz. In other words, this is the story of a girl who, in her own unique way can be as good (or better) as any other.<br />The script is full of wit, charm and all the elements that remind us of old classic comedies like Born Yesterday or Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The story of a blonde girl who decides to go to Harvard just to impress an ex-boyfriend is just the start of a great story about friendship, self-esteem, pride and the right to be different. Add great dialogue, hilarious characters, plot twists and great jokes and there you have it: a winning project that will leave everybody laughing out loud.<br />Everything is right on this film and the DVD also brings a nice tray of extras. Check out the commentary and you'll get to know more about the film and its characters. A great buy - arguably, the greatest comedy of the year!

B00005JL96|5.0|Like many other reviewers--I came to this movie expecting something much different--something light and zany a la the Emperor's New Groove. Instead what I saw was the best movie of 2002. It asks a very serious (though expertly disguised behind beautiful watercolor animation and a great deal of very funny scenes) question--what does it means to be part of a family. Its answer: unconditional love between, and mutual responsbility to, each other. <br />A truly wonderful film.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney bust into the pop scene with her above average debut album ...Baby One More Time. Her debut album sales reach a peak of 13million which no other pop singer can do than easily. My favs songs includes the Title Track, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, Sometimes, Born To Make You Happy and a few other.<br />After a year, she's back with her sophomore album Oops!.. I Did It Again. This is also my fav Britney album of all three. Songs like Stronger, Lucky, Title Track, When Your Eyes Say It and many other more are great.<br />At 2001, she released BRITNEY. That's the album that i save my cash on. BRITNEY seem to be her worst album to date. The lead single from the album I'm A Slave 4 U is really the worst song that a singer can ever produce but Britney did it.

B00006G8LB|5.0|This movie has everything! It has the classic struggle between good and evil, romance, an action! Spidey fans will find some changes have been made, but it fallows the comics very closely!!!!!
0375414053|2.0|I was absolutely exhausted reading this book!  I have been a work-outside-of-the-home mother, a stay-at-home mother, and a part-time-at-home mother.  A lot of what Kate Reddy goes through is true to life, but this book was just too much!  I didn't care about her childhood, and I thought the degree to which Kate/the author patronized and infantilized men was just ridiculous.  Kate Reddy did not have my sympathy one bit.  She deserved to feel guilty and exhausted.
B00006F83Y|5.0|i can't really compare this album to anything- Queens don't take themselves too seriously, so their album has this experimental feel to it. Each song is a masterpeice in itself, with time signatures that tie your head in a knot and chord progressions that you only understand after a few listens. Its stuff like this that forces rock to evolve. Theres no excuses not to own this one.
B000000W5B|3.0|Sorry all you revisionists, but I think the reviewers had things right the first time around.  There are some pleasant moments on this album, make no mistake about it, BUT WHY is it that halfway through spinning this album, I always get a hankering to pull it from my player and punch up \\"Exile\\" instead?  I'll tell you why.  \\"Exile\\" has the blues, the bite, the go-for-broke Stones in all their ragged glory.  \\"Goats Head\\" marks, (as another reviewer wisely put it,) the beginning of the Stones' descent into self-parody, and I ain't just talkin' 'bout \\"Mr. D.\\"  \\"Silver Train\\" is a pale imitation of EXILE'S \\"All Down the Line,\\" with a lame beat that Charlie Watts could pound out in his sleep.  \\"Can You Hear the Music\\" is the Stones trying to be Sly & the Family Stone and falls flat.  \\"Angie\\" is a catchy ballad, but lacks the world-weariness of \\"Wild Horses.\\"  On the other hand, \\"Winter\\" works, as does \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Starf***er,\\" but already we see the Stones moving toward a slicker 70s sound that's passable, but nothing compared to their 1968-72 heyday.  Too bad Keith & Co. got kicked out of that French basement where the funky \\"Exile\\" stew was concocted.  \\"Goat's Head\\" has some nice tunes but misses the attitude by a mile.  Buy this if you're a Stones fanatic... beginners should start at \\"Exile,\\" \\"Beggars,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and a compilation of the early stuff with Brian.

0385484518|5.0|I recommend that everyone read this book at least once. If you are a teacher I recommend that you assign this book to your students because they will learn a great deal about life. Fortunatly, my sociology instructor assigned this book as a mandatory read for a critical analysis paper. Otherwise, I may not have read this life-changing book. <br />Morrie was a sociology professor, but he taught his students a lot more than how to observe social situations. He taught his students how to be human and that is the most important lesson in life. Too many people miss the point in life and persue the wrong things that only lead them down the road to unhappiness. Morrie is absolutly right in that most people feel unfullfilled in life because they have bought into the fallacy of the American culture. Our culture conditions us to believe that money is everything in life and that the more money and the more success we have the happier we will be. This is a lie. <br />Morrie encourages us to create our own subculture by placing love at the top of our list. It is critical to the success of society that we learn how to be human by being compassionate, sincere, forgiving, and giving and accepting love. We must look inward to our hearts for fullfillment instead of outward for material gain to provide us with a false sense of security and happiness.<br />Few people in life have the insight and wisdom of Morrie. His philosphy is simply to let love rule in your life. Many people go through life never realizing what is truely important. Family and friends are the true treasures in life, not financial success or anything else.<br />Thanks to Morrie many of us can realize the secret of life before it is too late. Our lives and the lives of our loved ones can be greatly enriched by the wisdome of Morrie.

It is one of those things that are nearly impossible to fill up; I don't know a single person who has filled up one of these cards. It is a great buy and a must have if you have any games at all for the PlayStation2. It is not compatible with the original PlayStation. Over all it is a great buy and if you are thinking of getting it buy it.

I have to agree with the author in that the knowledge contributed to many people by Morrie was probably the most important information they could attain in college or in life. <br />Many people are unhappy and feel unfulfilled because they buy into the fallacy of the American culture. Contrary to popular belief, the aquisition of wealth and power are not the most important things in life. We have taken the gift of life for granted, and sadly many of us never realize this sad fact. Morrie's philosophy concerning life include learning to love, being able to accept love, and living life in a way as to avoid future regrets by learning to forgive yourself and others.<BR>Fortunatly, there are beautiful souls in the world like Morrie who touch our lives and add richness to it through their wisdom. Morrie advises us to make our own culture by being compassionate, helping out in our communities, and most importantly loveing one another. The success of society depends on people learning what it means to be human. The true treasures in life are family and friends, and the person who dies with the most \\"toys\\" wins nothing.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok, if you've heard \\"dirrty\\" and your thinking \\"i'm not too sure about this cd\\" ... think again.  dirrty is actually the least challenging song for christina on the album and not really a true representation of the rest of the cd.  she really expands the use of her vocals into different realms from total \\"whitney\\" like vocals to \\"fionna apple\\" like songs. her slower songs are AMAZING and she really opens up her true self a little more.  if you liked the first album you will like this one!
B00006SFBD|4.0|I've had a pre-release copy of Deliverance now for over a month. I've had the chance to put about 50-60 listening hours into the album, and feel my opinion will be a somewhat less biases from a review standpoint.<br />     By far, Opeth's newest disc \\"Deliverance\\" is a great album. However, I do not feel it is a superior album to anything they have released previously. Deliverance is a bit more experimental and has a different style than anything I've heard from them before. However, some of the songs have a familiar feeling. Here is the track list for the album: 1) Wreath 2) Deliverance 3) A Fair Judgment 4) For Absent Friends 5) Master's Apprentices 6) By the Pain I See in Others.<br />     What I'm going to do is write this review based on the songs and give a description at the end. Starting with \\"Wreath\\". Wreath took me a lot of listening to before I finally started to enjoy this song. At first impression, this song starts off with really fast and aggressive drumming. The drumming on this disc is far heavier in sections than heard in an Opeth album before. My first few times listening to Wreath, I did not like it; this song is not too catchy! Eventually the song grew on me, but it is nowhere near as good as the rest of the tracks on the CD.<br />     Deliverance, the title track and second song of the CD, is by far my favorite piece on this album. From start to finish this song is probably the most true to something you'd here off of the last 3 Opeth albums. What I really love about this track is the ending. The end section is similar to something you would hear on a Fear Factory CD where Opeth's drummer, Lopez, matches the drumming to the guitar riffs. Overall, Deliverance is a really flashy song that will really appeal to any Opeth fan.<br />     Track three, A Fair Judgment, is another song I'm iffy on. This is the only clean tone vocal song on the album. It starts out really soft with piano, which I really love. However, the first 3 minutes on the song is really eerie and accompanies the song well. The thing is, I really don't like it. Then about the second half of this song kicks in about 3:30 - 4:00 minutes into it. This part is really cool, and the vocal melodies are great. At the end of this song, it retorts back to the beginning part of the song. A Fair Judgment somewhat leads into \\"For Absent Friends\\" which is a 2-minute instrumental. This song is nothing special, and is nowhere near as cool as Patterns in the Ivy (Blackwater Park) or Requiem (Orchid). <br />     Master's Apprentices is definitely another one of the best tracks of the disc. It starts off Cannibal Corpse / Morbid Angel heavy. This song is really different but a great addition to the album. There is a really great interlude in this song that really fits this album well. Track six, \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\", is the most experimental song I've heard by Opeth. The song reminds me of White Cluster or Moonlapse Vertigo from Still Life. The intro vocals are different than anything I have ever heard from the band and they sit on top of acoustical guitar work. The thing is the vocals are distorted but not death metal style almost as if they are done with a distortion effect. I really enjoyed By the Pain I See in Others from the first time I listened to it. I really hope to hear Opeth write more songs like this in the future.<br />     Overall, Deliverance is a great album. I'd give it (on a 10 point scale) an 8.5. My Arms, You're Hearse, Orchid and Still Life are my favorite Opeth albums. Followed by Morningrise, Blackwater Park and then Deliverance. Don't get me wrong, Deliverance is my least favorite Opeth album but is still a phenomenal piece of work. I strongly recommend purchasing this disc if you are a fan of the band (or genre). So, check it out... You'll like it!!! I promise!

1559409002|4.0|This 1962 black and white cult classic was directed by Herk Harvey during a 3 week vacation. As the film starts out we learn Mary Henry is the only survivor in a car racing accident. The accident doesn't seem to fade her, and she is off for her new job in another city as an organ player in a church. As she drives to the new town she passes an old deserted carnival. Soon after she begins seeing a man following her everywhere, and has other weird things happen to her. She has nightmares, and becomes very paranoid. A doctor thinks all this is a result of emotional trauma from the crash. She doesn't think so. She believes her answer is at the carnival and she goes there to find out. <br />This film is amazing considering it was shot on a budget less than $30,000 and in 3 weeks. The direction is superb, and cinematography is wonderful. The script is pretty good for 1962, and would foreshadow some films of recent years. The whole film has an eerie atmosphere, with a creepy soundtrack. The only problems are the acting is not great, and on the DVD the audio of the dialog is low. For some the film may be to slow, but if you can handle that, then don't worry. Those are the only problems. If you picture yourself in the woman's situation you will see how frightening this film is. I recommend this to anyone who likes creepy atomospheric intelligent horror. 4 stars. Check it out.
B000021YQV|5.0|Very rarely especially in today's music world can you call an album a masterpiece, but Toxicity, the latest album from System of a Down is definately worthy of that label. Mostley every song on the album is grounded in politics and the songs are fueled by the virtuosity of vocalist Serj Tankian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, drummer John Dolmayan, and musical genius/guitarist Daron Malakian, who is responsible for writing most of their songs. This album contains elements of many different genres of music, the most dominant is of course, metal. The album opens with Prison Song which is about the U.S. prison system, the song shows some of Serj's vocal abilities, by going from a whisper to a scream in the matter of one line. That is like many songs on this album, he has the ability to completely change the sound of his voice and his singing style. Some more high points on the album include the songs Deer Dance, Needles, Bounce, and Forest which are all heavy upbeat songs with odd time changes and insane lyrics, to say the very least. I'm sure most of you are familiar with the singles: Chop Suey, Aerials, and the title track...Toxicity all of which are amazing songs and do a very good job summing up the what is an amazing album. Another song worth mention is ATWA, it's a slow/midtempo song featuring amazing harmonies between Serj and Daron. This album is definately worth the money, it's a true classic and i personally feel that it will go down as one.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This 1954 film was directed by the great master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock and stars James Stewart as Jeff, and Grace Kelly as Lisa. Jeff is a photojournalist with a broken leg after an accident on one of his previous news assignment. He is bound to his wheelchair in his small apartment over looking a wide variety of people with different stories, and situations. He's bored so he observes them, but when one of them shows suspicious behavior, he believes there has been a murder. He becomes obsessed and watches day and night, even getting his friends involved. Since they have no evidence, they must investigate themselves.<br />This is another masterpiece from Hitchcock, with many layers, and stories going on. The direction is great, and the film ends very suspenseful. The acting is perfect by both leads. The film is great as entertainment, but also you can have a variety of interpretations of what Hitchcock really meant with this film. This is a classic and should be in every film lovers DVD collection. Highly recommended. 5 stars.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Don't let the current trend in indie rock bands fool you, The Strokes are completely different than the Hives, or the Vines, or the White Stripes...they're actually good. Even though the songs sound very similar it's not necessarily a bad thing, they stay true to a formula that works, it's obvious after listening to the album that the band members do dummy down their playing for the album, but it works very well. While guitar players Albert Hammond Jr. and Nick Valensi are responsible for the overall sound of the album, the real star of the band is Julian Casablancas, his vocals and lyrics are amazing and very differernt that anything around at this time. Even though they haven't fully taken off yet, they gained a dedicated cult following with singles such as Last Nite, Hard to Explain, and their current single Someday, all of which are absolutely amazing. There is only probably one song on the album that could be considered filler, Take It or Leave It. The rest of the album features somewhat short and to the point songs. The best song on the album in my opinion is Trying Your Luck, it's one of those songs that will be with you all day long. Some other standout tracks include Soma, Alone Together, and Barely Legal. The title track is also a standout, it's very short and mellow but sounds great, another song not featured on the U.S. edition is NYC Cops, which is an excellent song, so if you find an import version it's definately worth it for the one extra song. All in all this album is definately worth it, and has a very wide appeal
B0000027I6|5.0|I picked this album up several years ago.  Must've been right after its initial release. Roger has always been a lyrical genius, but on 'Death' he's has incorporated a musical touch that amplifies his message.  Had this album benefited from the musical genius of David Gilmour, it would have (no doubt) been ranked among the most brilliant pieces of Floydian history.  It's still a masterpiece, regardless of the abscense of the 'Floyd' sound.  Roger is my eternal hero, but the added emphasis of Dave would have propelled this album beyond The Wall and even Wish You Were Here.<br />Stop.<br />Roger and Dave still command the ranks. 'Death' is better than any solo album and even better than any post-Waters Floyd album.  Dave did a fantastic job with 'Division Bell' and 'Reason<br />', but 'Death' is Floyd reborn, and Roger is still at its core.<br />I definitely recommend this album.  If you like powerful lyrics and (even in this case) powerful music, Amused to Death is an experience you will not soon forget.

B00004Y62T|1.0|I can see how this would be a good novel or play.  As a movie, the pace was off.  It was bogged down in details.  The slow character development was tedious, leaving you to wonder when ANYTHING was going to happen.  From the point where Mr. Ripley kills Dickie Greenleaf, I watched in anticipation of seeing this vile person captured.  Instead, Ripley misleads some pretty dim characters.  He's not even a convincing liar.  He gets nervous and sweaty each time.  That he spent Dickie's money without remorse repulsed me more than anything else did.  I wondered when the film would end repeatedly.  It was sheer torture to spend so much time in the company of a loathsome con artist/serial killer.  I would never willingly watch this film again.  Matt Damon did an excellent job and I still can't stand to look at him to this day because of it.

B000002MU3|3.0|R.E.M.'s 1994 album MONSTER came two years after AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE, an album of soft grace and absolutely perfect production, which thrilled many fans (I consider it the best album ever). With MONSTER, however, the band took off in an entirely different direction. Gone is the acoustic ambience of the two previous albums, and instead the band rocks out with screeching electric instrumentation and a ragged sound that shows the band taking what they want out of then-nascent grunge rock. It's often considered a brash, noisy record, and yet if one examines it without thinking of it as the post-AUTOMATIC release, MONSTER can be a tremendously entertaining album.<br />MONSTER opens with &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth.&quot; Most listeners would instantly remember this odd take on a schizophrenic's assault on Dan Rather in the 1980's because of its massive exposure following the album's release, including such stunts as having Rather sing it at one of the band's concerts. It's a good-time song, not the best the band has ever released, but fun to listen to. The following songs, the entire first half of the album, are the best. &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; is a rather experimental track reputedly inspired by an encounter with Courtney Love. &quot;King of Comedy&quot; strays even farther from familiar R.E.M. ground, as Michael Stipe's vocals deeply and angrily chants against being chained to corporate dictates. &quot;I'm not a commodity&quot; may have been ironically sung before tons of concert-goers, but at least it shows that this is a band that strives for originality. &quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot; and the frenetic &quot;Star 69&quot; may sound wild and unexpected, but their style is but a fantastic electric update of their sound from ten years before.<br />The second half of MONSTER is mostly a let-down after the first, validating many complaints about the album. Songs like &quot;Tongue&quot; and &quot;I Took Your Name&quot; go nowhere. The savage &quot;Let Me In&quot; is an exception. A reaction to Kurt Cobain's suicide, Stipe's pained and passionate vocals are backed only by layers of Peter Buck's razor-sharp guitar.<br />MONSTER is definitely a period album. So much of the sound and lyrical content is rooted in 1994. As a result, those who don't care much for that wonderful year may find the album dated, like psychadelia from the late 1960's. This makes the album difficult to rate, I've ultimately given it three stars, as I found it's first half extremely listenable.;Let Me In&quot; is an exception.

B00005JKCH|5.0|By taking itself somewhat seriously, Spiderman proves that a &quot;seriously&quot; made comic book is both entertaining and rewatchable.  In addition to the standard &quot;this is how a superhero is made&quot; elements, there is a love triangle, a search for a purposeful life, and other pieces which are subtley done.  The acting is excellent throughout.  My main criticism of the film is that spiderman looks too computer-animated.  The DVD extras are good... you know plenty about the film by the time you're done.  The main commentary by Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst and some others has some neat insights, but there's too much &quot;credit has to go to so-and-so&quot;.  That stuff is nice if you're &quot;so-and-so&quot;, but unilluminating to someone outside of Hollywood.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I recently bought this c.d,due to the fact I totally fell in love with the latest track\\"You Know Your Right\\", and I really want to keep Nirvana alive. If you dont already own this album,BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!Although I did really miss the songs \\"Drain You\\" and \\"Polly\\",this album contains many of the songs that totally made us fans fall in love with Nirvana.I would say Krist,Dave,and Courtney did a great job.This is something every so called hardcore fan should already own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanx Courtney,you are always loved!!!!!!!!!
B000002NJS|2.0|Madonna's improbable career has been fascinating to witness: One of the most famous (and infamous) stars in the world, she put out a 50-dollar book of glossy sex photos, and became a loving single mom, she starred in the blowzy musical Evita, and she has released glossy pop singles, dance-floor sensations, breathy come-ons, and at least one high-profile ode to spanking. She is one of the most enigmatic and unpredictable celebrities in the world, and her 13th album Ray Of Light-her first collection of new studio songs since 1994's tepidly received Bedtime Stories-mostly lives up to that remarkable legacy.<br />It does take a while to get going, opening with a couple of dreary ballads and other electonica-induced songs, though once those clumsy declarations of maturity and chage are out of the way, Madonna packs most of Ray Of Light's remainder with remarkable songs. The dense, doomy ballad \\"Skin\\" is effectively dramatic, and the pumped-up title track is bound to be a deserving smash. The chugging \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" has a chorus (\\"Nothing really matters / Love is all we need\\") that should ring across dance floors for years to come, while the atmospheric \\"Frozen\\" is a great first single. Much is made of the record's electronica influences-as well as Madonna's collaboration with producer/remixer William Orbit, but it's never distracting, in part because she wasn't exactly grunge before making the switch. Besides, Ray Of Light sounds ok from start to finish. At 67 minutes, it could have used some judicious editing: For example, it wouldn't have been a tragedy had those first two tracks been lopped off.
B00006NSGX|4.0|With \\"Unplugged\\" a decade gone by, the time for another live Eric Clapton offering is most welcome.  So out comes \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\", a more expansive (career-wise) concert that provides a refreshing twist on his classics, and a taste of his newer material in a live format.<br />Clapton is in fine form here.  He is still at the peak of his guitar prowess, and his vocals seem to get better with age, as he knows his limits while also infusing that gravelly \\"growl\\" in the right places, as any good bluesman would.  His set seems a bit more laid-back or mellow than in previous years, but he still fires off plenty of driving rock to appease his most hard-core fans. <br />Disc one of this two-CD package could almost be classifed as the \\"new\\" segment of the concert in that the majority of songs are from the past decade.  Also, the first half of this disc is drawn from a mostly acoustic format, which is a outstanding display of Clapton's talents.  Few performers these days would take a chance at dropping an instrumental into their live set, but Clapton does here with a catchy version of \\"Reptile\\".  One of the hidden gems on this disc is the scaled-down, acoustic-driven \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", which comes off beautifully.  <br />Having seen Clapton in Seattle during his \\"Pilgrim\\" tour, I knew that the tracks from that CD sounded so much better live than they did with the awful, overproduced R&B presentation on the studio cuts.  The same holds for this live disc; he performs several songs from \\"Pilgrim\\" here, with the same pleasing results.  <br />Disc two of \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" hits the throttle a little harder, as Clapton rolls through more of his classic hits.  A slightly re-tooled version of \\"Badge\\" is another gem on this package.  However, he seems to roll too quickly through \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", which nearly rips the blues out of this classic blues staple.  He also performs an uninspired version of \\"Cocaine\\" in which he also adds the lyric \\"that dirty cocaine\\".  Quite obviously cocaine is - like any drug - horrible, but he almost seems to give a more politically-correct bent on this song.  \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" is overdone, and not helped by the unintelligible, over-dramatic singing from one of his bandmates.  The other hits are good, if not unspectacular, and the closing number - \\"Over The Rainbow\\" - is a surprisingly pleasing track. <br />The one handicap with this CD set is the sound.  Overall, the sound isn't bad, but there are places where it's not all that great.  In a few places, most notable when he's talking between songs, the \\"echo\\" from the speakers in the arena are picked up.  Also, there are a few points where the instruments drown out Clapton's vocals, or vice versa.  I will concede that it's tough to finesse an audio track recorded in an arena setting, but there have been higher-quality recordings from similar settings and venues. <br />All in all, \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" captures Eric Clapton in strong form, and the tracks recorded provide a nice broad brush of his career.  The sound quality is a bit of a drawback, and a couple of songs not quite up to par, which keeps me from giving a full five-star rating.  However, there is plenty about this release for all to enjoy, and it will be a worthwhile addition to anyone's collection.
0783241542|4.0|Crazy movie! Bound to spawn more sequels than one and many offbeat parodies. I wonder what would happen if they made an American Pie movie when these characters are in their forties? LOL
0060523794|5.0|While at IBM Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. developed a reputation for arrogance and for being aloof. One would never suspect this from reading his book, in which the author gives generous credit to the many thousands of people who created the IBM Corporation and to many others, by name, who helped to save and resurrect it. <br />As a former IBM executive who took early retirement twenty years ago, just as the company's bureaucracy was starting to strangle the organization, I was fascinated to learn how that bureaucracy spread and the extremes to which it went, creating a culture that <BR>led to committee decisions, tacit compromise, and actions taken to protect oneself. Even more interesting is the rapidity with which Louis Gerstner disgnosed the sickness of the company and administered tough medicine.<br />Despite IBM's condition, Gerstner saw it correctly not only as a business enterprise but as a &quot;national treasure&quot; well worth restoring. <br />Unlike Jack Welch's adolescent &quot;Jack: Straight From the Gut&quot;, this book focuses on the processes of leadership and management, the elements of strategic choice, and the decision process. But it speaks also to the issue of corporate culture, at IBM a  culture based on values rather than just on being first.<br />As a recovering IBMer I salute Mr. Gerstner for his achievements,<BR>and as a reader I applaud him for this exceptional contribution to the business book genre.
B000023VR6|4.0|Okay, I know that this is Dr. Dre's project, but Eminem along with other great collaborations makes this CD even better.  The CD is full of nonstop hits and hilarious skits.  This CD is definitely a must have in your music collection so go get it if you don't have it!
B00005JKCH|1.0|I'm not a fan of the whole comic book genre, but I can appreciate when it's done right on the big screen. Superman and Batman were very well-made movies and I really enjoy and appreciate both of them for their creativity and honesty. About as much time elapsed between Superman and Batman as between Batman and Spider-man (note the creative hyphen), yet Batman was in no way a rip-off of Superman; it, instead, had an entirely different style, plot and spirit. Spider-man, on the other hand, is very much a mimicing of Batman... with concepts also copied from Superman, just to increase the chance of success.<br />I'm sure that many could readily and willingly count on both hands the ways in which Spider-man is different, but the differences are superficial. When you dissect the big picture, it's really just the same story told with different characters... and an avalanche of dizzing CGI shots that must've seemed like reason enough to make the movie.<br />Sure, Batman wasn't too deep, either, but it was fresh and, thus, its shortcomings forgivable. Spider-man fails not so much because it is THAT bad of a movie, but because its all been done before. Spider-man is a clone, inspired not by creativity, but by proven formula. Hollywood sometimes pulls it off, but Spider-man isn't one of those times. It could've been fresh and highly entertaining, but convention and formula won out the screenwriters' pens over originality and creativity. It's really a shame.<br />That said, this is all in the opinion of this reviewer. Spider-man has garnered tremendous addulation this year from most everyone else. I honestly cannot understand why. It probably has some to do with the complete lack of quality in the theaters in 2002. It is probably also indicative of an audience looking for cheap, momentary Summer thrills rather than the satisfying kind of old that stayed with you and had you looking forward to returning to see it again the following weekend, rather than simply to the DVD.<br />Spider-man is your typical, brainless Summer thrills movie, and if that's what everyone wants, that's fine. My main concern is that such public appreciation for a subpar movie will no doubt bring a flood of more movies lacking in plot and originality that I doubt that the public is aware that they're asking for.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The DVD release of \\"Band of Brothers\\" is an exceptionally high-quality home video product. For anyone interested in World War II or epic filmmaking, this is a must have.<br />The set consists of six DVDs, five of which contain two episodes each. At first you may wonder where the audio and language options are when the main menu for each DVD appears. These menus appear once an episode title has been selected. The menu for each episode includes chapter selection, an episode summary, a variety of audio options, and in the package's only real failing, the option to have only Spanish subtitles or none at all. No English subtitles are available, so the hard-of-hearing or the script geeks (like me) who like to follow the text on the screen, will need to have TVs with built-in closed captioning.<br />The sixth DVD includes the documentary that was aired on HBO about the real men of Easy company, as well as trailers for upcoming episodes. Additonal video features include the premiere of the series at Normandy, where the actual veterans of Easy Company were in attendance. It is great to see the actors together with men they portrayed.<br />One feature found on every DVD, which I found incredibly useful, is the Field Guide. This has definitions of every military term used in the series. For those who have wondered about military ranks, this field guide has the complete listing of each rank, along with the appropriate isignia. Take a look at this before viewing, and the appearance of characters' uniforms will be much more meaningful.<br />For those who saw HBO's Golden Globe/Emmy winning mini-series when it was telecast, this DVD will be a welcome way to revisit and savor this great depiction of a true story (or rather, multiple true stories). For those who have not seen it, this is the one HBO product to have. Forget \\"The Sopranos,\\" forget \\"Sex and the City.\\" These are quirky products which are vastly over-rated by the critics. \\"Band of Brothers,\\" on the other hand, is a monumental achievement for television, rivaling the dramatic intensity of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and far surpassing every other war movie released since then except for \\"Blackhawk Down,\\" another true story. If you think that, because it was made for television, it will pale in comparison to its megaplex brethren, think again. \\"Band of Brothers\\" stages some jaw-dropping battle sequences, and follows the lives of a cavalcade of characters with deft skill. Acting, direction, editing, special effects, music...all are top-notch.<br />A few riveting moments:<BR>Episode 2: Easy Company assaults and captures a German gun position that was firing on the landing parties at Normandy. The episode's epilog points out that this assault has become THE textbook example of how to attack a fixed position, and is still taught at military academies today.<br />Episode 3: Easy Company holds the line against an armored assault by the Germans after the companies flanking them have fled the field.<br />Episode 9: On patrol in the woods of Germany, Easy Company stumbles upon one of the great horrors of this or any war, a concentration camp.
B000068TPN|5.0|I just came across this Reuters 11/11/02 news story concerning \\"We Were Soldiers\\" and \\"Green Dragon\\" and was shocked by what's happening to one of the actors. Thought I would share it with all viewers out there, whether you have watched or intend to watch those two films.<br />\\"A Vietnamese actor branded a traitor by the Hanoi government and placed under virtual house arrest for appearing in an American-made Vietnam War film has broken his silence to call the charges against him \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"cruel.\\"<br />\\"Don Duong, who played a Vietnamese officer opposite Mel Gibson in \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" and a refugee in  the 2001 film \\"Green Dragon\\" opposite Patrick Swayze, defended his work in a letter released this week by family members in California. Duong's relatives have said the 45-year-old actor has been placed under house arrest and restricted from traveling and could face jail time. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" depicts the battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam's Central Highlands in 1965, in which men from the 7th Air Cavalry led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore, played by Gibson, overcame a more experienced and much larger North Vietnamese force.\\"<br />\\"Gibson and others in Hollywood, including Duong's \\"Green Dragon\\" co-stars Patrick Swayze and Forest Whitaker, actor Harvey Keitel and \\"Soldiers\\" director Randall Wallace, have called for leniency in his case.\\"
B00006LLNV|5.0|Elliot Goldenthal, the scorer of movies such as \\"Heat\\" and \\"Titus,\\" comes back with a brilliant blend of traditional Mexican and original latin music to go with one of the best movies of 2002: Julie Taymor's \\"Frida.\\" The soundtrack as a whole is simply outstanding, yet it has some peak moments: Lila Downs' performances, most specifically the opening track, 'Benediction and Dream,' the sexy tango 'Alcoba Azul' and the theme that plays during the closing titles, 'Burn it blue' which she performs with Brazilian super-star, Caetano Veloso. Also the rendition of \\"La Llorona\\" by Chavela Vargas is outstanding. The tracks that are part of his score work are also outstanding, and reminded me a lot of the music from the album \\"Ronroco\\" by Argentinian composer and producer, Gustavo Santaolallas. All in all, a very eclectic and hypnotizingly beautiful soundtrack with supreme good taste.
B000063DIH|3.0|To say this is good would be playing with the truth . From here to eternity is a mess from start to end . Fear is the key , The Apparition are mediocre . Weekend Warrior would have been decent , only they had to make it semi hard rock . Otherwise the album has some great material - be quick or be dead , chains of misery , the fugitive . The album has two  absolute masterpieces - afraid to shoot strangers and Childhood's end . The title track is somehow better live .
0375823360|5.0|To describe this book in less than the 1,000 words (the maximum for reviews) would be impossible. These books are perfect. They have everything that a good book should have only 20 times better. Mystery, sci-fi, fantasty, love, all of it. Pullman takes you into other worlds and on great adventures. Lyra is the main character and as you read on you see not only her, but all the characters change and you will grow to love them.  Each time that I finished a chapter I couldn't stop reading.  The books went by so fast I was horribly sad when I was done. The reason I am not telling you much about the story line or the plot is because there is to much to it, and like i said before, I can't describe it in 1,000 words.  I'll leave you with that.

B00006L3S3|2.0|First, let me say that I think the sound quality is amazing and would be interesting as a \\"Novelty.\\" Hearing stuff I've never heard before is cool and put a smile on my face for the first listen and I love hearing some of the parts in the mix I've never heard before. I feel the same way about the other John Lennon \\"RE-MIXED/ RE-MASTERED\\" CD's that have come out in the last few years. But... now that \\"Mind Games\\" has come out in the same way as it's predecessors I really wish they would have just re-mastered John's albums the way the were recorded and left them ALONE!!! They sound very different from the original recordings. As flawed as some of the original mixes are I would think that for history's sake we wouldn't repaint the \\"Mona Lisa.\\" The re-mix DOES change the music completely at times. For example... The beginning of \\"Meat City\\" sounds completely different than the original. The new version is much mellower. Also, the end of \\"Meat City\\" is missing some of the spoken words. I always thought that was one of the coolest things about this album. And... It must be noted that it was flawed on the original CD release also. It faded out TOO SOON also! Was it lost on the master tape somehow? If not this MUST be corrected! Overall... This would be cool as bonus disc with the original mix CD. Perhaps a 2 CD set. If we all complain enough maybe we can get them to re-issue the orignal mix simply remastered. (I wonder if they're planning on doing that. What a great way to get me to buy the album a total of 4 times :)....Strange but, I never heard hiss on \\"Nutopian International Anthem \\" before... wasn't it complete silence and only 3 seconds long not 6?<br />I'm wondering and somewhat paranoid about what will happen to \\"Wall and Bridges\\" and \\"Rock n' Roll\\". I am now going to go to E-Bay and look for the original LP/ Album/ Record/ Vinyl (which it looks like I may have parted with too soon) and place a bid just so I can hear John say... \\"Why are they doing those strange things\\"... maybe he was forseeing the future about these re-mixes.<br />Today is May 18 2013.

B000002MJC|5.0|I have been a fan Of DM for a long time.  I used to listen to my sisters tapes of People Of People and Catching Up... I was so excited when My mom brought me the tape of SOFAD back in 93 and when they took me to see them live during the SOFAD tour.  I love Martin Gores and David Gahan's vocals.  They are so dark and mysterious on this album.  My favorite tracks are &quot; walking in my shoes&quot;, &quot;Condemnation&quot;, &quot;Judas&quot;, &quot;Mercy In you&quot;, &quot; In Your room&quot;, &quot;Get Right with Me&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;One Caress&quot; and my personal favorite in which they started out at the very beginning of the show &quot;Higher Love&quot;  this is DM at their best.

B00007BKVC|5.0|Before I say anything else: Thelma & Louise is not a male bashing, anti feminist film. If you see it as that you are sadly identifying with the wrong characters! It's a thrilling tale full of life affirming energy and the two leads each deserved twenty Oscars each! On a par with Toys as my favourite film ... and I'm male! This is an alternatively powerful, harrowing and hilarious slice of 90's cinema that ranks among one of the best films ever made.<br />MGM released Thelma & Louise early in 2001, for a fairly early disc, it carried a strong line up of special features, which happily have found their way on to this SE re-release. The original release had a damn shoddy print quality, as MPEG encoders had still not quite been perfected yet, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 was all over the place!<br />Not now! The film has been stunningly remastered into anamorphic widescreen, and looks like it could have been made six months ago. The soundtrack also benefits extensively from a good cleaning up, still remaining in the standard 5.1, it has an enormous presence now. It is quite incredible that MGM have managed to house a 2 hour film plus well over two hours of extras on a single 9GB disc ... <br />The most rewarding extra feature on the disc is the new hour long retrospective made in 2000. It features almost all of the principle cast and behind the scenes characters, and is cleverly broken down into five sections: Conception, Casting, Production, Reaction, and the final section is devoted to the cast and crew looking back on one of the most brilliant pieces of cinema ever to grace the world, all looking understandably pleased to have been involved. <br />Elsewhere, you can enjoy two audio commentaries, one featuring director Ridley Scott (very rewarding and a good deal of technical information and insights into how difficult it was to get a ground breaking film like this made) and a second featuring Susan Sarrandon, Geena Davies and screenwriter Callie Khouri. This is a more chatty and funny track, but Khouri keeps the two witty cast engaged in conversation relevant to the film, not stopping a few hilarious outbursts along the way. The deleted scenes are very interesting to watch, and it is (for a majority of them) a good thing these were cut, they wouldn't really add anything. <br />A more controversial extra is the much hyped alternate ending. Extended is really a better word, showing T&L's '66 Thunderbird falling at an awkward angle over the cliff, somehow ruining the whole effect that the two girls had just launched themselves into freedom. The are also some very good storyboard sequences, startingly similar to the actual shots in the film and a collection of theatrical trailers and home video previews. <br />Please avoid the music video however, it is shocking 80's cheese and disturbing to think it was only 12 years ago!<br />All in all, MGM has done a fantastic job and put a lot of thought into creating this Special Edition, and if you already own the 2001 version, for God's sake go buy it anyway!
B00000J7JO|5.0|ok for starters i wasnt gonna review this album.. but after reading so many stupid reivews (ie giving this album 1 or 2 stars!!) i now want to settle a few things..<br />firstly, the peppers WERE NOT THE LIMP BIZKIT OF THE 80z.. RHCP have talent (whereas limp a teenage wannabe - fred durst).. if you dont believe me PLS download stone cold bush on SNL (around 1990) - get vid from kazaa or something - and youll see why flea is considered one of the best bassists and john downright cool. Secondly, RHCP are good live!! ive seen them!! go see them and find out why many have actually labelled them world BEST LIVE BAND!!!! :P.. also kerrnag awarded these guys BEST BAND IN THE WORLD in 2002!!!<br />ok, now to the album... this was the first peppers album for me. really, really enjoyed it especially around the world, otherside, scar tissue and parallel universe. overall every song on this album is good to very good.. no absolute classics really but definitely worth 5 stars - best album of 1999. I recommend buying BSSM as your first chilis purchase then either Californication or One Hot Minute.<br />Give credit where credit's due. These guys earned it!

B00003CX8Y|5.0|I was so happy that one of my most favorite Disney movies was finally going to be out on DVD.  I wasn't disappointed either. The classic came back to life because the picture was so amazing and the sound that much better. I also enjoyed all the special features that came with this DVD, namely being able to watch the entire DVD in French.  That was quite amusing.  A must have for any true Disney fan!

B00006CXXU|5.0|OK, fans of Chris and non-fans alike.....<BR>I must admit that I have been a Christina fan since she began her recording career. I mean, really, this girl can belt a song.<BR>But the single thing that attracts me to this album most is the fact that she doesn't use her trademark \\"vocal gymnastics\\" to sell this album. The material on this album has alot of depth-from a giant talent. Yes, she caught alot of flack for \\"Dirrty\\", the albums lead single, and although it may not have as much depth as the some of the other tracks, I'm sure the intent was to give the club scene something to dance to --and it does rock.<BR>My personal favorite track on the album is \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\", a song about protecting your emotions when a lover just wants a \\"physical thing\\".<BR>\\"Infatuation\\" is fine track as well, a great song about mother-daughter relationships and making choices for yourself, becoming your own person.<BR>\\"The Voice Within\\" is a strong ballad that should be released as a single that encourages a girl to trust her intuitions, be strong, learn all she can, and most of all to be proud of who she is. <BR>I think with alot of artists, a follow-up album can make or break a career. Christina has no worries. She has gone really deep for this CD, and it has paid off. \\"Stripped\\" is fantastic...I highly recommend it. It's  more than just a pop album, it's a CD about self-discovery.
B00006CXXU|2.0|Christina may try too hard to please her fans with this LP. First of all I Am no Christina Aguilera fan but I Found a time to listen to this album and there are many things I Want to say. First of all she collaborates with many well known artists. Not like theres anything wrong with that but they write and produce for her and it becomes a big whole mess. This album is way too long almost 78 minutes and after I listened to this album i felt relieved it was over and I Did not want to listen to it again. There are some songs in between that are good but this cd contained a lot of filler. All the songs are different with different production and vocal ranges and its good that there are some variety on the LP however when the songs are so different you cant exactly find Christina on it. The songs are many way too long and the LP becomes a half empty even being so long. it needs more depht and more originality. She just decides to do this and do it well instead of thinkin wether this is good or not. And by the way I Dont like her image and I Just saw her at MTV Europe Music Awards she barely could sing a note and she lip synched in some verses of the song Dirty and not many people were applauding.
6305971153|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen.  I watched it years ago when I was 7 and I still love it today,  It is not just a gimmick movie playing off a cheesy plot, but it has a good base, AND a fun Christmas extraveganza thrown in for good measure.
B000001E7T|5.0|One of the best Albums of the 90s. A great gem for a woman in rock. Was voted the album of the year in numerous magazines and truyl deserves it. If you are a music lover and you dont have this album. Buy it now and if youre into girls in rock music this is a must have. Buy it now its among the best.
B00005OC0G|4.0|This CD shows the NY Phil at their very best. Lyrical, with the excact mixture of grip and spaciousness. Kurt Masur leaves the NYPO at the Zenith of their accomplishments. <br />Mutter is colorful. A very different approach from many other recordings such the Karajan one ( w Mutter), or Barenboim/Zukermann) or Furtwaengler/Menuhin. Still here, some of the serene beauty is missing.<br />Buy it for the NYPhil performance! You won't regret it!
0060523794|1.0|\\"Gerstner quarterbacked one of history's most dramatic corporate turnarounds.\\" <br />This is nothing but a load of . . . . The fact is IBM turned around as the economy turned around, and did it slower than most companies. To make people believe he was doing something, Neutron Lou got rid of bodies, and that is all he did. <br />\\"When I said in August of 1993 that the last thing IBM needed right now was a vision...\\" <br />This was an appropriate statement because as far as turning the company around was concerned, (little) Lou did not have any vision. The only vision he had was how to get rich by using inflated earnings to inflate the stock price. This was Lou's only reason for being at IBM, a golden opportunity to make millions at the expense of laid off employees and stockholders who are still holding stock. <br />\\"\\"Lou Gerstner saved IBM, period,\\" the Times wrote.\\" <br />An example of one corporate giant scratching another corporate giant's back. This kind of hogwash is what resulted in the accounting scandals that have recently been publicized. No one had the . . . to say what really happened.<br />\\"Gerstner said his retirement from IBM will not be affected by shareholder concerns about executive compensation. In recent months, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch has come under fire as details of his retirement package were made public during divorce proceedings. Welch later gave up some of his perks, such as a New York apartment.<br />When asked whether he was worried about his own package, Gerstner replied, \\"Not a bit. Not a bit.\\"\\"<br />Do you really thing someone who fleeced a company for 500 million dollars has any concern for what anyone thinks?<br />How can this type of person capitalize even more on the hype that was his career? Why not write a book.
B000002HPT|5.0|I got a bit fired up when I noticed that this CD only averaged a 4 star rating , come on people you know its better than that! This is the most polished Dream theater CD to date and the songs are very well writen .With classics like A new millenium, and Lines in the sand, both cutting edge prog metal, beautiful songs like Peruvian skies and Hollow Years , great rockers like You not me and to top it of a magnum opus, Trial of tears, this CD is not only great, its longevity lasts. James Labrie sings better than I have ever heard him sing on this cd, John Myung is always consistant, John Petrucci is at his best, Mike Portnoy, his placement is far greater than usual, Derek Sherinian well all i can say is the split must have been personality based, cause Dereks keys are outstanding on this CD. I would put this recording in the top 3 Dream theater CD`s. This recording runs for over 75 minutes and is jam packed full of goodies.
0425107469|5.0|I finished reading \\"Watchers\\" last night, it took me whole six days, to read this incredible story. Everyday this week i was wondering when i will get some time to sit down and finally read it!!<BR>The story about Travis, Nora and Einstein will make anyone fall in love with them. I am not the worlds biggest dog fan, but i came to love that dog in the story and i couldnt get enough of it. I felt sad and happy reading it, i even felt sad for The Outsider. His obsession with Mickey Mouse was almost cute, when his cave was found, with the folded blanket, and those little ornaments, i felt sorrow and pity for the creature. I dont want to give the story away, like some other readers had, so i minght sound ambiguous for now.<BR>And when i read the sentence \\"Fiddle broken. No doctor...Afraid, afraid\\" i wanted to cry!!!<BR>Fabulous book, kept me on the enge of the seat from the 3rd page, and didnt stop till the end! The thought of the Outsider was constantly on my mind. Best Koontz book yet!
0312119038|4.0|A distinctive memoir of life-altering decisions is made utterly interesting by the author's painstaking class act as a writer.  All the verve and clear insights of 'A History of God' are here under a more intimate patina.  Karen Armstrong's patient English temperament can almost drive you to distraction as she seeks the calling God, but reward for your own patience is found on nearly every page.  Surprising is Armstrong's regularly vivid self-criticism, and it's interesting she possesses a post-Christian understanding true enough to keep her at all times from recrimination, toward both the Church and her own decisions.  It's a mark of post-cloister spiritual maturity that colors the whole book &amp; makes it a satisfying read on many levels.  Armstrong's intelligent economy of thought and language combine with sharp insight and simple English forthrightness to make a winner.  You wont be disappointed with Narrow Gate.
B000002U8G|5.0|This album is an absolute must for any pink floyd fan.  Fearless &amp; Echoes are two of the most insightful pieces of music I have yet to encounter; the rest of the CD is also wonderful.  I have nothing but praise for these beautiful tracks.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I could begin by telling the wonderful story of how the one hit wonders (Creep) came back with a fantastic second album (The Bends) that not only proved the critics wrong but cemented them in the music world. But I'll not as it is a bit tiring and you've most likely heard it all before. Instead I would like to make clear my opinion on this particular album. I've (literally) listened to this album tens, perhaps even 100+, times and I am still amazed at how fresh and interesting it remains despite my exploitation of the record. After countless listens to No Surprises I still managed to discover something new which added a totally new dimension to the song and the album follows the same suit, there is always something new to discover. That's what sets great albums (Nevermind, Dark side of the Moon, Sgt Peppers, Rumours, The Bends) apart from the good albums. You don't get sick of them, you can play an album 20 times and not get sick of it and when you find this album then this is a true great. OK Computer is just such an album by 5 very talented musicians. If you don't like their music you can't deny their talent. For me, I will always hold OK Computer in the highest regard but beware OKC, Kid A is fast approaching the top with every listen.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie, perhaps my all-time favorite, is about the theme of how the deepest object of our affections can allude us no matter how much we desire union. In this case, music is made into the touching metaphor of Love and Salieri is the fumbling Romeo who's courting technique, no matter how admirable, fails in winning his beloved.<BR>But Salieri is content in being near his love, always with the hope that one day his efforts will be acknowledged by God and he would be rewarded with the ability to become united with music. Then one day, Mozart, here portrayed as the most annoying, obnoxious, despicable character comes marching in. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, isn't the character we love to hate. It's almost painful to watch him on the screen and so it only helps us understand Salieri's bafflement all the more on how such a fool could be blessed with such a aspiring musical genius.<BR>   In short, Mozart the bad boy, gets the girls, while Salieri the good guy is left to wallow in the unwarranted torment, he believes, God has created for him.<BR>   Of course, this isn't historically accurate in the least, but should we expect anything else from Hollywood? However, as a film in-itself, Amadeus will leave you breathless.
B00006LJ72|2.0|I love Enya, and I do have this collection, but there is something corrupt about it. Where are ALL the b-sides? Let me show you a list of them: Isobella, May It Be, Aniron (Theme for Aragorn and Arwen), I May Not Awaken, As Baile, Eclipse, Morning Glory, Oriel Window, Song of the Sandman, Midnight Blue, The Promise, Storms in Africa Part II, Willows on the Water, Oiche Chiun, Book of Days (Far and Away), An Ghoath on Ghrian (The Solar Wind)-although I know that's stretching my hope much, S'Fagaim Mo Bhaile, and The First of Autumn. WHY WAS WEA NOT SMART AND MAKE ONE ENTIRE DISC A B-SIDE COLLECTION! We fans, have been waiting for years!!! Not only does this collection not feature these rare beauties, but it does NOT have even some of her great hits! Like \\"On My Way Home\\" (ask me if I've ever cried during that song) and \\"Only If...\\" (a whimsical song without equal). I'm very disapppointed with this release, mind you the production value of the set is wonderful, especially the notations from Roma (she's a personal savior of mine), everything else about this collect is down right cheap. It's as if Enya has no control over these releases (there's been three of them), and the company just tells her what they're going to do. Or, I shudder to think, Enya actually WANTS to do make these releases cashing in on all of us, her poor noble fans.
B00005JKCH|5.0|&quot;Spider-man&quot; is a very good send-up of a comic book hero. The director Sam Raimi filmed many scenes in such a way as to almost seem like paging through a comic-book's storyboard while watching the exciting action and stunts. (For example, there's a scene where you see the DNA being mutated and this is what you'd see in a panel on a page in a comic book, explaining how Spider-man got that way.) Toby Macguire is believable as Peter Parker, nerdy teenager who becomes a superhero, and Willem Dafoe is always reliably nasty as a villain. His facework in the scene showing the dual Dr. Osborn-Green Goblin is worthy of an Oscar. A bit role played by by J. K. Simmons as &quot;J. Jonah Jameson, Daily Bugle Editor&quot; was particularly amazing--he looked exactly like the comic book drawing. <BR> <br />The surround-sound was quite distinct in this DVD--in fact, sometimes it seemed a bit contrived, as you could hear vehicles pulling up behind you, but they were clearly forward of the action on screen. However, for the explosions and special effects, the surround sound plus the wide-screen format made the action film very exciting on the home screen. We didn't regret that we missed this in the theater.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The two monsters James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski work at Monsters, Inc., a company that generates energy by collecting screams from children.  However, children are getting harder to scare due to social influences from media and Monsters, Inc. is struggling to produce power for the city.  One evening when James stays to finish up some paper work he finds out that someone is working at an unauthorized time, and a child is accidentally sneaking into the monster world.  This is extremely dangerous, because the monsters have been socialized to believe that a child's touch is as lethal as the ebola virus.  Monsters, Inc. is an entertaining film that teaches morals concerning parenting, greed, fear, and much more and will have the audience laughing hysterically.

B00005R87K|5.0|By not having any, FW Murnau's visionary film Nosferatu succinctly demonstrates how severely dialogue can dilute and trivialise a piece of cinema. Even disregarding the technical and artistic limitations prevailing at the time this film was made (if by 1929 cinema was no longer in its infancy, it was certainly still pre-adolescent), this film is one of the most astonishing pieces of cinema I have ever seen.<br /><br />What is greatest about it - and pretty much everything about it is truly great - is the visual imagery and the beautiful way in which every scene is framed. I think I'd have missed a lot of this if I'd been focusing on a linear narrative, which is what an audio dialogue would have obliged me to do. At first the absence of dialogue seems an imposition on the modern viewer (it wasn't one on the director, for I am certain he felt no need for it) for it forces one to concentrate on looking. It seems an odd thing to say, but in these enlightened cinematic times, I really don't think we look properly any more. And what a treat it is when you do.<br /><br />Not a frame is wasted. Each shot - even such innocuous scene-setters as morning light falling across Hutter's face and Ellen relaxing with a kitten by a window - anticipates another, and creates or reinforces motifs as the film carries on. Murnau subtitled Nosferatu \\"a symphony of horror\\", and (though it must sound frightfully pretentious to say so) the construction of this film really is symphonic.<br /><br />While it forged countless cinematic devices which have since become cliches of the horror genre, when you view it as a symphony, it really isn't a horror at all. In this day and age it isn't frightening, but it certainly is haunting, and beautiful, but more than anything else, it's sexual. Despite having seen many different versions of the Dracula story (including Coppola's overtly sexual reading), I had never appreciated how deeply this story is an essay on sexual repression and potency. When you look at it this way - Nosferatu is really just a personification of Hutter's absent sexuality - the horror falls away. And this is unquestionably how it was intended: Watch Ellen's first approach to Hutter at the commencement of the film. We see the closed door, resembling a coffin lid. She opens it and creeps around the door, and approaches Hutter - from stage right - with her talons outstretched. When he accepts her embrace she nuzzles into his neck ... action for action, it is exactly how Orlock first approaches Hutter in his castle. Given how carefully every scene was framed (from time to time they resemble paintings, they're so well constructed), this could not possibly be a coincidence.<br /><br />Aside from the bloodsucking (which apart from the final scene, is all implied), there are many truly haunting images: darkness seeping like blood across the Carpathian valley; darkening skies behind the rugged mountains; the black ship of death silhouetted against the sun; a procession of funerals down an otherwise abandoned Wisborg street; Ellen waiting amongst partially submerged crucifixes on a desolate ocean beach for her loved one to return (note to file: it is Orlock who is coming by sea; Hutter, by contrast, is coming round the mountains); and one quite extraordinary shot in which, as the black horse-drawn coach carries Hutter to Orlock, the frame is suddenly plunged into the negative - but eerily, the Coach and Horseman remain black...<br /><br />The version I viewed had an extremely enlightening narrative from a satin-voiced Australian film critic, and some interesting featurettes about the history of the locations in which Nosferatu was filmed.<br /><br />the only point on which I'd mark the film down - and then only really on \\"authenticity\\" grounds - is for its curiously (and ironically) dated sounding electronic soundtrack, which sounded like it was generated some time in the eighties. While it is a moody, discordant piece which fits the film well, the obvious anachronism does jar a little at first.<br /><br />Werner Herzog made a fairly faithful \\"talkie\\" remake of Nosferatu in the late 1970s with the great Klaus Kinski as the count and Wagner's Gotterdamerung providing the soundtrack. This is well worth checking out, but in terms of building your film library, Murnau's original is a keeper.<br /><br />Olly BuxtonWerner Herzog made a fairly faithful \\"talkie\\" remake of Nosferatu in the late 1970s with the great Klaus Kinski as the count and Wagner's Gotterdamerung providing the soundtrack.

0679441018|5.0|In the fifth Vampire Chronicle, Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic mortal daughter of a drug lord. Dora has moved Lestat like no other mortal ever has, and he cannot get her out of his visions. At the same time, he is increasingly aware that the Devil knows who he is and wants something from him. While torn betwen his vampire world and his passion for Dora, Lestat is sucked in by Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil himself. Memnoch presents Lestat with unimagined opportunities: to witness creation, to visit purgatory, to be treated like a prophet. Lestat faces a choice between the Devil or God. Whom does he believe in? Who does he serve? What are the elements of religious belief? Lestat finds himself caught in a whirlpool of the ultimate choice.<BR>This one matched the first two and with a more *magical* touch in the way Anne presented the first 50 pages. It was alluring and more of a spider web the way she spinned the events around the reader.

B0000025KI|3.0|Despite it's significant commercial success, &quot;The River&quot; is without doubt Bruce Springsteen's weakest recording with the E Street band. Perhaps due to incessant critical pampering, perhaps due simply to a creative lull, \\"The River\\"  for the first and ONLY time in his career, sees Springsteen sounding uninspired and repetitive. The first record is definitely the stronger of the two with the pop smarts of &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, the moving father/son ballad&quot;Independence Day&quot; and the sorrowful lamentation of the title track, displaying Springsteen in top form . For the most part however, he is caught in mediocrity, chugging out bland rockers and cheesy, overwrought  ballads, many of which would not be out of place on a Bon Jovi album.(see \\"Crush on You,\\" \\"Drive all night\\"  ). Furthermore, the production is a mess with the vocals often being swamped by  muddy and irritating guitars and Weinberg's drumming slipshod at best. Critics of \\"The River\\" have often queried why Springsteen felt the need to record a  double record and certainly a more strict culling process  would have made this a more coherent release if nothing else. My personal contention however relates to the songs Springsteen left off the record. &quot;Roulette&quot;,&quot;Where the bands are&quot; and &quot;Held up without a gun&quot; were all recorded during &quot;The River&quot; sessions and are far superior to much of the pedestrian  material on the actual release. Of course this is obviously opinion and Bruce probably sees the whole thing in a different light. All the same, I'm pretty sure I'm right.

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a unique, multi-faceted story of a small town and the people who live there during the mid `30s.  As I began reading this story, I found it hard to keep up with all the characters that played a part of it.  The deeper I read however, I began to understand that the author was portraying the many facets of people who made up the town of Maycomb Alabama.  <br />The story's central focus was on two young children, Scout and Jem, of a widowed lawyer Atticus.  It portrayed how life was in the small town of Maycomb through the eyes of Scout.  Harper Lee does a wonderful job of weaving the meaning of the title, into the story, and its relationship to a trial of a young black man.  <br />In reading the back cover, I found that Harper Lee considered her book to be a simple love story.  I believe it to be more of a story about human compassion, or the lack there of.  This book is very descriptive in detail, that one could plainly visualize its characters and setting.  Although I thought it started out slow, I found it hard to put down (I can't wait to see the movie!).<br />I highly recommend this book to young and older readers!

0316666343|2.0|I'd waited months to read this book (before I'd finally gotten around to getting a copy of it) and dove right in after receiving it.  My honest opinion?  The first 21 chapters are AMAZING.  They are filled with humor, sadness, and a 14-year old's perspective that really brought back some memories of my own (I was a child of the 70s also).  However, around the 20th chapter or so, the author seemed to lose direction and the book went from being a sweet story to something resemblimg &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot; or &quot;The Twighlight Zone.&quot;  It was a huge let down after reading all of those first chapters that were so beautifully written!  I'm not sure what happened in the writing process to make the tone change so dramatically in the end but I'm glad I read it since everyone is talking about it.  I wouldn't recommend it to others because of those last few chapters.

B00006M183|5.0|This album is very good. I hope all of you agree that a lot of work was put into this album, especially the production. It was an excellent idea to get Adam Kasper producing because you could notice how &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;crisp&quot; the sound quality was. i was also impressed with the songs that Matt Cameron wrote. For example, &quot;cropduster&quot; has many variations in the tempo and key signature. We should all give Pearl Jam credit for the music they've made for the past eleven years. Thanks guys!
B00005MP58|4.0|The production itself deserves all five stars.  I can't think of enough good things to say about it, and its faithfulness to the original book, my very favourite novel of all time.  <br />The transfer to DVD, as has been noted by others, is disappointing.  I am very happy to have this work in DVD format, because I expect I shall watch it several times a year, but I do wish the colours weren't quite so washed out.  What a shame.  <br />In my opinion, it is still well worth having.
B00004T8RK|3.0|I can say that Binaural is a decent album, but there is something missing in it. If you were a person who didn't know much about Pearl Jam, you'd probably think that this was the last studio album they released. I recently bought their newest studio album titled &quot;Riot Act&quot; and to me, it sounds much more &quot;Fresh&quot; than this one. My favorite songs off this one are &quot;Thin Air&quot; and &quot;Light Years&quot;. Light Years sounds like it belongs on &quot;Yield&quot;. &quot;Soon Forget&quot; in my opinion, is a comical song, but was a waste of time. If I were Pearl Jam, I wouldn't have even put it on this album. For some reason &quot;Grievance&quot; is a song that I CANNOT listen to. There is no explanation for this. Dont get me wrong, Pearl Jam is my favorite band and I consider them the BEST rock band in the world, but this is not their best work. The production done by Tchad Blake was awful! I guess that's why &quot;Riot Act&quot; is better because Adam Kasper is an excellent producer. I'm not saying &quot;Don't buy this album because it's not that great&quot;, i'm just stating my opinion.

I'm curious about the new audio version and wonder about the movie that's been promised for years, but I never tire of Johnson's vocal characterizations -- from pompous Ignatius to the porter Jones, the gay man in the French Quarter, Mrs. Reilly, Miss Trixie, and the great Santa Battaglia -- they're all fabulous.<br />...I just talked myself into buying a used back-up copy. I won't lend the one I have until I do. This is a review of the abridged audio version (out of print).

B00006IR5S|5.0|This is one of the BEST soundtracks available today. I think this represents some of John Williams best work. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams has done it again. This soundtrack is an absolute wonderful thing to behold. Just as he did for the Star Wars movies, he has carefully crafted the themes from the first movie with some brand new cues. Fawkes' theme is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard. The music from these two movies is quickly becoming my favorite orchestral scores, a spot previously held by The Rocketeer, by James Horner (another excellent score). Buy this soundtrack, you will not be disappointed!
0618001905|5.0|I call him thing because I would never give him the respect of calling him king.  This book is so unbelievably horrific that I can't believe I was reading what I was reading.  I'd like to dig him up and torture him like he tortured my African ancestors.  You will be mystified at what people will do in the name of \\"greed.\\" People of African descent had better read this book and never forget what you read.  Many thanks to the author for bringing this ghost to my attention.
B0000026J6|4.0|The songs contained on this release are absolutley stunning.  Cohen mixes a world weary point of view with a dry dark humor, and his verbage so economical that not a word is wasted. Cohen may not have the &quot;golden voice&quot; that he jokes about in TOWER OF SONG, but he nails the vocals on every song here with just the right emotion and inflection.<br />Then comes the backing tracks.  This could be a primer on cliched 80's production values.  Cheesy synthdrums, backing vocals worthy of Diane Warren songs and generic keyboards would destroy lesser artists or tunes.  Only TOWER OF SONG and EVERYBODY KNOWS get treatments worthy of their fine lyrics and vocals.<br />I would love to see Cohen redo this album with a sympathetic producer, who would frame these dignified tunes with the backing they so richly deserve.  It never hurts to dream.

B00006CXXU|4.0|I admit that when brought this album to the cash register to pay for it, I wanted to hide under the counter in embarassment. I only bought it to review it for my school newspaper, so imagine my surprise when it was good! This album features a soulful insight into Christina's past that begs the listener to ask, \\"Where has this girl been?\\". But under the naked, cess-pool dancing Christina is the talented singer-songwriter who evidently woke up from the pop coma she was lulled into by producers a couple years ago. With songs featuring Alicia Keyes and Lil'Kim, Aguilera gets down to business and addresses her mom's abusive husband ( \\"I'm OK\\")and her own experience with unhealthy relationships (\\"Fighter\\"). This is really not my type of music, but I was astonished at the maturity of the lyrics. I recommend it to anyone looking to change their mind.
B00003CXXP|1.0|must have been one of the worst movies i've ever seen...and i've seen a lot of them
6304362498|4.0|I am adding my own two cents to this review not to offer a critical analysis of the movie itself, (All of the previous reviewers have covered it well.) but to further question why a movie that was so hyped when it came out in '84 has seemed to have all but disappeared.<BR>I was, like others in this review, both surprised and appalled to find that this landmark piece was not readilly available. For anyone who has every read the book, one must question this for it would seem that this movie was itself put in to a &quot;memory hole&quot;! With the recent attacks on our freedom in the USA from our own big brother, (Bush, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, &amp; co.)you would think that this movie would be in great demand.<BR>I recommend this movie,( and the book for that matter!) to any person who is concerned about recent developments in our society and about the constant erosion of our most basic freedoms.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is one reason you shouldn't smoke cigarettes. The other requires smellivision.
B00005BCPC|1.0|Jane Austin wrote about society in the Nepolianic era no more and no less. to polititisise her works is to do them no justice. I have enjoyed many a film that was loosly based on her novels and if this movie had been give any other name I would have given it a highter rating. This story was not and I repeat was not Mansfield Park! not as Jane Austin wrote it anyways. Sence and Sensabilities took liberties but this was a all out fraud. watch the BBC mini series its production value leaves a lot to be desired but the interpertation was excelent and I enjoyed it a great deal.
0060523794|5.0|While at IBM Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. developed a reputation of aloof arrogance. One would not suspect this from reading his book, in which he gives generous credit to the tens of thousands of people who created the company and to many others, some by name, who helped to save and resurrect it.<br />As a former IBM executive who took early retirement twenty years ago, just as the company's bureaucracy was beginning to strangle the organization, I was fascinated to learn how that bureaucracy spread and the extremes to which it went, creating a culture thst led to decisions (if any) by committee, conspiratorial compromise, and self-protective behavior. This is not the IBM I had known. Even more interesting is the rapidity with which Louis Gerstner diagnosed the sickness of the company and the speed and persistence with which he administered tough medicine. <br />Despite IBM's near-terminal condition Gerstner saw it correctly not only as a business enterprise but as a &quot;national treasure&quot; that was well worth the collossal efforts needed to restore it.<br />Unlike Jack Welch's adolescent &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;, this book focuses on the processes of leadership and management, strategic choice, and the decision process. But it speaks also to the essential importance of corporate culture, at IBM a way of life that is based on values rather than just on being first.<br />As a recovering IBMer I salute Mr. Gerstner for his remarkable  achievements and as a reader applaud him for this exceptional contribution to the business book genre.<br />Don't miss it.
B000062TU1|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie.  I love the books and thought I would be disappointed but I wasn't.  There were certain changes but the look was right on target.  The actors were perfect for the roles.  Kudos to the entire cast!<BR>An instant classic!
0151008116|5.0|When hearing about the premise of this book, I thought it was intended to be a fable at best. I mean, a story of a sixteen year old Indian boy and a Bengal Tiger that share a life boat after their ship sinks couldn't be a real premise, could it?  Man was I wrong. This fantastic adventure story is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit, a fascinating study of the way we relate to animals both behind and in front of bars,as well as a raw example of the human instict for survival. Pi Patel's sometimes violent recounting of his over 200 days at sea is one of the most engaging books I've read this year.I've already started stocking up on copies to give to people for the holidays.
0792845730|5.0|If you're looking for a good supercop science-fiction movie mixed with tons of strong violence and blood & guts, then this is the movie for you. Robocop is the ultimate supercop movie that takes you on an incredible thrill ride like no other film has ever done before. Peter Weller does a splendid job as a police officer who is gunned down by baddies and brought back to life as a supercop robot known as Robocop. There's plenty of bloody carnage and for gorehounds. The action scenes and climax are very very intense! If you loved Terminator 2: Judgment Day then you'll friggin' love this, man. I guarantee it!!!!
B00006M183|1.0|This is the worst CD Pearl Jam ever came out with.  There are only 3 songs worth listening to.  The other songs sound as if the band was playing one song and Eddy was singing another.  The rips are too short and don't match the beat of the song.  Can't believe that this is the same band!!
B00006LLNU|5.0|This cd has been in my player since it came out. It's a stunning piece of music that builds on what the band started with Aegaetis Byrun, and takes it further. Writer Warren Ellis said of 'Svenfn-G-Englar' on that album: 'it's like God crying you a love song from the moon'. This new album is a sonic shaman's trip. Beautiful, otherworldly, spacious, elegant, ecstatic, moving, journey music. I saw Sigur Ros play in Atlanta recently, and their live renditions of these tracks were amazing, building to a moving finish with the incredible track 8. <br />Lovely.
157492589X|5.0|I'm a viewer of westerns from way back.  From Have Gun Will Travel, The Rifleman, and my favorite, Gunsmoke, I've relished the chronicles of hard men in a hard land making hard decisions.  I've seen all the Clint Eastwood westerns, Shane, Rio Bravo, Red River, The Searchers, The Magnificent Seven, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and I can say unequivocally that Lonesome Dove is the best western 've ever seen.  All the performances are great but Robert Duvall's Gus McRae is absolutely indelible and has become my favorite character in film no matter what the genre.  Certainly Lonesome Dove had an advantage over the aforementioned western films by being a mini-series and thus having more time to develop the characters and story, but the production values and performances rival those of the finest film.  We should rejoice that it was a mini-series because there was no other way that true justice could be done to the great novel it was adapted from.  It has both scope and intimacy, unbearable cruelty and immeasurable tenderness, romantic dreams and crushing reality.  I've never seen six hours go by so fast.  It is the best western ever.
0060523794|2.0|Gerstner's book is one of the most self-congratulatory and disingenuous insider accounts of all time.  Arguably, IBM was down and nearly out in 1994.  Moreover, much of his analysis of the pre-Gerstner era is closer to the truth than old-timers might be willing to admit.  Fat, sassy, arrogant, ingrown, puffed up, and unprepared to meet the challenge of an industry undergoing monumental change--and competition.  But the human toll--i.e., the bodycount--of Gerstner's actions is never really acknowledged.  Ask any of the tens of thousands of loyal IBMers who were summarily kicked out of their offices, especially those who were nearing retirement or had many years of seniority--and you will hear a different story.  Some would tell you how IBM then hired them back at half the wages and no job security.  Not quite Chainsaw Dunlop, but for many--close.  A companion book that undertakes extensive interviews of the victims of this &quot;turnaround&quot; would nicely complement this official view from the top by the man who has the most lose from a nuanced analysis of this period. So too would a work that examined the lines that IBM sloughed off--e.g, the printer line to Lexmark--that managed to regain corporate esprit and turn a pretty profit from IBM castoffs.  In a word, there's less here than meets the eye!
6305081751|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of those deep, touching movies that you can watch over and over again. Most tear-jerkers can only be watched once or twice a year. This movie can be watched anytime. It has humor and a light-touch that strikes you. Cher gives a great, oscar worthy performance. Eric Stolz is amazing. This is pretty much his best performance ever. The soundtrack is really good too.<br />The best part in the entire movie is when his mother buys him a prostitute. That part always has me laughing and crying. It is so touching and moving.<br />If you have never seen this movie then I recommend it, although Amazon doesn't have it in stock for DVD. Buy it on VHS or rent it. It't one of the best movies you will ever see.
6305181772|2.0|This is a great movie if you are a fan of action films.  Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt.  Jon Voigt fair as Jim Phelps.  The supporting characters add to the action and the suspense is solid throughout.<br />But if you like the TV show, this is a lousy movie.  It has little spirit from the TV show and what they do to Phelps is a crime.  If Hunt's character is created new for the franchise couldn't they have used another character - instead of Phelps - to play the role they designed?  <br />When you remake a television show there are certain elements that should be true to the remake - otherwise totally remake them.  Putting in new characters?  OK - just don't play with the believability and the make up of the old ones.  Of course when a show is as old as Mission you aren't going to want the same leads playing their old characters, at least not if they are in a lead role.  Voigt is not Jim Phelps - appearance:  wrong; style of speech: wrong; leadership ability:  wrong.  <br />This isn't to say that Mission is so sacred that it can't be changed.  But if the plan is to use the popularity of an old TV show to stir interest, why insult that popularity in the manner in which they did?  Dan Ackroyd used the Dragnet franchise to make a comedy years ago - but he honored the spirit of the show in doing so.<br />The long technical moments showing Barney and Willy or some other character from TV are missing here and probably rightfully so.  They could be boring on the big screen, especially if not done right - and it appears that the director and star weren't planning on doing it right.<br />This is a star vehicle for Cruise and he handles it well.  But they had no business messing with the franchise.  At the least, they should have made up for it in the sequel.
0385508417|2.0|I always believe if you take the time to read, make it worthwhile.  Something to tickle the kanoodle at least.  This book was just a waste.  It would be fun for a 12 year old.  It was just downright silly.  I expected more from Mr. Grisham.  I am willing to bet that one of his kids either wrote it or gave him the story line.
6305358613|3.0|Elizabeth is quite my favorite member of English Royalty, and I had always felt that her life would make for a brilliant movie. So I was terribly excited when this movie came out-- and I cringed and writhed in fury through the whole thing. <BR>  Yes, I will grant it is beautiful cinematography, costumes, acting, dramatic tension, etc (hence the 3 stars), HOWEVER! I expected dramatic license, but that they would strip away her brilliance, her independance and self-reliance, everything that made her the fascinating woman we know and respect, was a shock and a severe disappointment.  <BR>  From the first shot of her floating about flowery fields in wispy clothes, and frolicking with her boyfriend, through the heartbreak! that turns her into a murderous machine, the whole thing was nauseating.  The woman in this movie starts out naive, trusting her lover, is disappointed by him, and consequently places her trust in another man as murderous and unscrupulous as the first was gorgeous. \\"Most lame and impotent\\" character development. <BR>  In reality, Elizabeth had had to save herself from the scaffold from a very early age with only her wits to rely on; she was a skilled diplomat before she ever even knew for certain she would acceed to the throne; she depended on no one, and indeed deliberately played her couselors against each other so that none could gain absolute power over her; she was certainly not indebted for her throne to a series of political assassinations. <BR> This movie is an insult to women, as it blatantly ignores all the strong characteristics of one of the most powerful women in history and reduces her to a sap who must cling to the men in her life to help turn her into steel.<BR>  Cate Blanchett was brilliant: it is one of the supreme tragedies of this film that she was wasted on it and she will not be available to play in the better version that I desperately hope someone will take it upon themselves to produce.
B00004YA12|4.0|I would not recommend this film as a &quot;must see&quot; for the general public. First, it's black &amp; white &amp; the unwashed masses will start fiddling with the TV/remote controls to correct the &quot;mistake&quot;. Second, it has subtitles; need I say more? Third, our viewing tastes have been molded by Hollywood over the years &amp; the filming style of the 1930s will appear stilted &amp; boring (see earlier &quot;review&quot;). Fourth, it's history...<BR>I would strongly recommend this film for the serious student. There is truth in the old saying: Seek and ye shall find. Serious students learn not by the repetition of dry facts but by understanding causes &amp; effects.<br />PS: Reviewer Thomas M. Seay is a pinhead.
0684853523|5.0|ON WRITING is better than I thought it would be. It's marvelous. I finished it in less than two days.<br />In the First Forward, Stephen King observes that popular novelists are never \\"asked about the language\\" when queried by admiring fans. Thus, he states:<br />\\"What follows is an attempt to put down , briefly and simply, how I came to the craft (of telling stories on paper), what I know about it now, and how it's done. It's about the day job; it's about the language.\\"<br />In the first hundred or so pages, King shares his experiences growing up in Maine and Connecticut, his marriage, his struggles as a novice writer, and his drug and alcohol problems. King intends this section not as an autobiography, but as a curriculum vitae. It ends with the assignment of the paperback rights to CARRIE, his first novel.<br />In the next 150 pages, the author describes how he performs his craft. He explains the \\"tools\\" of writing (vocabulary and grammar), the creative environment (the room, the door, the determination to close the door, and the music - Hard Rock in King's case), style and formatting (paragraphing, narration, description, and dialogue), and the final stretch to a finished piece (drafts, editing, and proofreading by a trusted friend - wife/author Tabitha in King's case).<br />The final few pages, in a way, are the most interesting. It's Stephen's account of the road accident in 1999 that inflicted multiple fractures to his ribs and lower body, and the effect the mishap had on his writing. Ironically enough, he'd half completed this book at the time of the incident, and he had to struggle to come back and finish.<br />Though King was once a high school English teacher, ON WRITING is in no way pedantic, but chatty and informal. It's a book straight from the author's heart, and it shows.<br />\\"Don't wait for the muse ... This isn't the Ouija board or the spirit-world we're talking about here, but just another job like laying pipe or driving long-haul trucks. Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you're going to be every day from nine 'til noon or seven 'til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he'll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.\\"<br />The author's first rule for good writing is that the writer must read a lot. Well, I do that - constantly. Perhaps I can improve my own poor scribbling. In this review, I've followed his advice; I've kept the paragraphs short and avoided use of passive sentence construction. That's something, at least.job is to make sure the muse knows where you're going to be every day from nine 'til noon or seven 'til three.

0767811070|5.0|Boyz In The Hood was John Singleton's directorial debut.  Only twenty-three at the time of the release, he crafted a gripping and revealing film about life in the gang-riddled, hard scrabble streets of South Central Los Angeles.  The movie centers around Tre, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.  Tre lives with his father Furious (Laurence Fishburne), an Afro-centric businessman, who is constantly trying to instill a sense of pride in his son about his culture and his people as well as a respect for life and becoming a real man.  Tre's best friend, Rick (Morris Chestnut), is a star football player being heavily recruited by colleges, but also has a young son.  Rick's brother Dough Boy (Ice Cube in his acting debut) has just served jail time and is a drug dealer who hangs on his front porch drinking 40's and dealing.  The movie is marked with violence as Mr. Singleton shows how on an average Friday night, gunfire can erupt and lives can be lost in an instant.  Mr. Gooding shows signs of greatness as he portrays Tre with a naïve and quiet quality, Mr. Fishburne is commanding in his role, but it is Ice Cube who gives the best performance.  With no prior acting experience, he is the heart and soul of the film.  The scene at the end of the film where Dough Boy and Tre are discussing the state of the ghetto is powerful, moving and heart wrenching.  Boyz In The Hood is Mr. Singleton's American Graffiti.  Though it doesn't wax nostalgic like that film, it is Mr. Singleton's ode to his youth and neighborhood and it is a lasting and powerful film.

0316666343|3.0|This book started off so good, I couldn't put it down. I did have my small criticisms on how the story was told. I felt that the author made Heaven look bland and unGodlike. But when the author threw in the twist near the end, where Susie goes back to earth, I was yelling \\"NO!!!\\"  She took a good  book, maybe a very good book, and turned it into a twilight zone episode!  It made the story go from charming, heartwarming, sad/happy, unique to ridiculous.<BR>I'm sorry the book took such a bad turn 3/4 way through. I can't believe the author could not think of better ways to tie up the loose ends . It's written almost in the Danielle Steele style. \\"Wrap  it all up in the last chapter\\" I was hoping that Susie would realize after so many years that she need not watch over her family anymore. That the killer was found and put away, and that she would move on to the real Heaven waiting for her, ~~didn't the Grandfather tell her she was not ready yet?~~ READY FOR WHAT!!??  I thought the author would have her symbolically kiss her family good bye until she see's them again, and that she would finally (sorry I don't write books) go toward the light!  Where HEaven would be the answers, the beginning and end all.  That Susie realizes that she needs to move on, take hold of her Grandfather's hand and wave fondly goodbye to earth,. But jumping into someones' body??  OOOOkay!!!<br />....Started off good...but then a letdown
B00005JLEX|5.0|Writing a review about a non-esisting Seinfeld tv sitcom DVD? Well, it seems someone at Amazon likes it, like millions of people on this planet (and who knows where elese :)<BR>X-Files, Star Trek, Friends, Fawlty Towers, 24, Malcolm and even Space 1999 tv series are now available on DVD. Why not the Seinfeld 180 episodes?<BR>The only reason I can think of is corporate greed. The show is still shown on tv, in the US it is broadcast at least once a day (in my area - even three times now - Fall 2002. Nielsen ratings are not publicy available for non-prime time tv so we do not know how many people are watching, but certainly quite a lot. thus attracting advertisers. What is bad in this, some shows are repeated very often (e.g. Contest or Car Dealership) while others are never or very rarely repeated (e.g. Mom and Pop Store, Puerto Rican Day). Fortunately dvd burners are so cheap now that some individuals offer home made episode collections, but not on ebay, which restricts it and chases for copyright violation. What can we do? Write to our congressmen?

0316666343|5.0|I read this book, after it was suggested by a co-worker/friend of mine. She loved it and another woman I know loved it also. I was intrigued by it and it grew on me as I read it. I have always been a believer that there is something else out there after we pass, and that there is a heaven and you can pretty much make your heaven personal. Well, in the middle of reading this, I lost my brother, he was murdered by a \\"friend\\" of his and tossed out of a car onto the curb, like garbage. I had to take a couple weeks to get back into this book, but it really helped me think about my brother and I am slowly becoming more okay with losing him and I know there was a reason I was reading this book at the time of his murder. Nothing will help me get over this, but I know that I will get past this and live my life, I know my brother would want me to do that. I love the way Susie would watch over her family and I hope he is doing the same thing for my family, because he did that while he was here and now he can do it in heaven. I know he is my angel. <BR>My only complaint with this book is that I don't think Susie's family, particularly her father, got any kind of closure. Mr. Harvey left town and he was still trying to get the clues he needed to show the detectives.
B00005JLRR|5.0|11/19/02 - How the heck can you review a movie not released yet? It's probably not even it its final edited form yet. I have read the script floating around the Internet some months ago and the trailers look like they have got the basic outline of the story, at least, accurate. Some details, if true, look to be intriguing and irritating all at the same time.<br />Ricker finally takes command of his own ship - after all he has done, it's about time. He goes flying off to sectors unknown at the end. They can bring him back for the next movie by using that hoary old device, blow up his ship and have Enterprise rescue him (see Worf in First Contact). Ricker and Deanna finally get married - nothing like a 30-year courtship and engagement - yikes.<br />Wesley makes a cameo - after living in the Traveler's realm of alternative reality he reemerges to attend a wedding, then gets edited out for time constraints? Hey Wes, how was the vision quest? Did you meet Sisko on the other side? Is Ashley Judd's know-it-all character in or out, married to Wes, cut out, too?<br />Worf is no longer Federation Ambassador in the Klingon Empire. OK, its better than getting a ship shot out from under you, I guess. Data looks like he will suffer from the worse case of RESET button disease ever documented. To what end? A cloned Picard? Big deal. Why would arrogant Romulens follow a human, anyway? Earth will be attacked and destroyed by 1 (one) cloaked ship. Excuse me, I see Earth's defenses have not gotten any better after being attacked by 2 big fat probes in the TOS movie series, 2 Borg cubes, creepy worm eating buggy aliens in Star Fleet headquarters, Kelvins, and what have you. It would seem to me that after defeating the combined Dominion/Cardassin/Breen fleet and incorporating some of the enhanced technology from the Borg and the future Janeway (who does make a cameo) that one ship, even a big-assed cloaked one, would be detected and destroyed before it gets to Sector 001.<br />I don't know. It's just a movie, but the producers have to understand that it will be dissected and analyzed by the faithful to death so it better be good and it better make sense. We will see.

B00005RFVL|4.0|I would expect a lot of people have high expectations of  this album. A lot probably have low. This is like sitting an eleven-plus of pop music; the examiners are we, the public, and the small boy is Robbie Williams. He can get halfway there because of his looks and cheeky charm, but with these songs, he will need a lot of talent too. The songs are associated with some of the finest technicians of his craft, and Robbie must have either a lot of confidence or a lot of arrogance to take them on. Convering songs so inextricably linked with another artist, Frank Sinatra in particular, will inevitably lead to comparisons, and doing a 'duet' with the said singer even more so. Even to a Robbie Fan like me the difference is obvious. Robbie is a great personality, he has style, and he is a good singer. But he is not a great singer. But full marks for trying. The songs just bounce along,and I suspect in years to come, especially with a few singles put out, we will get more used to Robbie's version of classics like My Way and the Lady Is A Tramp. But will we ever think of his as definitive versions? I don't think so. I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen is a strange thing. It is totally Robbie and not very much in the style of the other stuff here. The excuse for putting it on the album seems to be that it fits better here than on a normal Robbie album, but I think it might have more to do with songwriting royalties. With many of the songs out of copyright, a greater proportion will go to the the holders of copyright material, hence - Robbie and his writing partner. My criticisms are niggles, this is a great album, and one which will remain on my turntable for a good few weeks yet.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|the follow up to the brilliant 'Headless cross' comes<br />in less than a year later... and is just as good as its<br />predecessor. Headless cross and Tyr are my 2 favorite<br />Tony Martin albums for the mighty Sabbath. i'd give this<br />4 and a half stars because somewhere in the middle (odin's<br />court, the battle of tyr) the album becomes kinda slack,<br />but kicks back in with the monstrously riffing 'Valhalla'.<br />so you got quite everything here; melodic excellence on opener<br />'anno mundi', lyrics you'll find yourself humming at the least<br />expected times (jerusalem, the sabbath stones, feels good to me)<br />and a muscular, fresh sounding closing rocker in 'heaven in black'. all in all, a total success in capturing the mystical<br />and ancient essence of the cold north.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this cd is very very good and the editor did not give him any justice at all. I just wanted to get that out of the way before i went on.Jonh Mayer is a very good singer/songwriter,he just seems like your next door neighbor or something,you wold never believe this guy is kinda famous.His songs are about things an average person can relate to,and there is just something about his songs that make you like them.The lyrics in his songs are amazing,and he is also a very good guitar player.Alos his songs seem to come from his heart which helps you like his songs even more.
B00006M183|1.0|Why can't this band wake Eddie up before they record his vocals. I've never heard a man sound so bored singing his own songs.After Yeild I was hoping they had gotten passed the No Code curse of boring me stupid but then came the last album that I won't even name cause it's so damn bad. Well too bad for me this follows the same road of mummbling garbage that has now become the PJ I once loved. If your gonna buy a PJ cd pick up Ten or Vrs. at least eddie was awake for those.
B000060OWV|5.0|His music is tasteful, diverse and technically advanced. This is another great Ford CD. Don't miss it.
B00005ATQC|1.0|Let me first state that I highly enjoy movies with an intellectual stimulus and that actually make you think beyond the roll of the credits.<br />This is not what this movie is.<br />What it is, is garbage.  There's no intellectual quest, emotional investment, or discovery of character.  It's an excuse to produce a film of nothing but people walking around naked in highly-unbelievable sadomasochitic bliss.  If this version is Kubrick's actual intent, then shame on him.  Tom Cruise is at his worst.  There's nothing enjoyable or even redeemable about his character.  He's just trite and boring.  Kidman fares somewhat better, given the material.  Ironic that after their divorce, her movies get better (bordering on brilliance) and his get worse.<br />\\"The difference between pornography and erotica is lighting,\\" said Gloria Leonard.  This movie is neither.  It's lining for the litter box.
B00006AG5N|3.0|I purchased this cd at costco this weekend. The first<BR>13 songs were &quot;mono&quot;. Songs 14-30 were in stereo. What<BR>up with this? I am very dissappointed.
0671027573|5.0|Not change-the-world writing, but definitely writing that fully commanded my attention until I knew I had to read it in one sitting.  It's impossible not to adore Jaine Bright, the plucky heroine of this novel.  She's foul-mouthed, hot-tempered, and perpetually in heat.  But she's funny, caustic, wry, and intelligent.  It's so refreshing to read about a woman who isn't terrified or can't take care of herself.  Further, Jaine is smart enough to know when she needs real help.<br />The basic story is that Jaine and three of her fellow colleagues are out for a drink after work one night, and come up with a list of attributes for their Mr. Perfect.  One of the four's loose lips separate and tell another coworker, who in turn spreads it all over the office.  Soon, it's posted on the internet and a media frenzy ensues.  It's really funny, until the group of four becomes three when a psycho concludes that the list was specifically targeting him and his shortcomings.<br />Good dialogue and a fast read.  Marriages fall apart and come together; estranged families learn what counts.  A good surprise ending concludes the tale.  Very satisfying.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Period.  If you give this less than 5 stars after a couple listens, that's fine. I would have. But since I wasn't hasty enough to make that mistake, I listened to the Cd about 10 times, and understood its brilliance on the 10th. Since then, OK Computer has been played about 40 times on my CD player. I still love it that much. This is in a 2 month span.<BR>Anyway, most of the new reviews are an effort to bring up the 4 star rating, which looks bad when bands like nsync get 5 stars. Screw the rating, if you listen to a couple songs of it on the internet and love it, then get this Cd. And please don't compare it to pink floyd. If radiohead is slow motion music, then pink floyd is dehydrated snail music. Pink Floyd also uses a lot of blues and classic rock scales that the incredibly inovative Radiohead guitarist doesn't.
B00006690G|4.0|The customer who buys The Eminem Show with sharp recollections of the vicious, sarcastic, inflammatory \\"Slim Shady\\" of the Marshall Mathers LP will be at once delighted, mesmerized and confounded by The Eminem Show. In that the songs offer onslaughts of epithets laced with all sorts of creative combinations of swear words and obcenities while exploring psychological caverns where civilized Americans don't want to go, The Eminem Show roughly approximates its vastly inferior predecessor. But with the exception of \\"Stan,\\" the Marshall Mathers LP offers no glimpses of the expressive, ingenious snarls of metaphor, rhyme and alliteration that emerge, however infrequently, in the Eminem Show. <BR>    The Marshall Mathers LP reveals an artist with a flare for rhyme, repetition and alliteration but whose verses consist mainly of piles of pedestrian cliches. Even in \\"Stan,\\" a fine and varied rap ballad, Eminem resorts to lines like \\"you've got some issues\\" and \\"I think you need some counselling.\\" Eminem struggles with this problem in The Eminem Show but to a much lesser extent. \\"Hallie's Song\\" repeatedly employs a reference to Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders: \\"sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders, / Everyone's leaning on me.\\" But Eminem develops this conceit much further that he would have on the Marshall Mathers LP. No sooner has the speaker described himself  growing \\"colder the older\\" than he relates how the \\"boulder on his shoulder\\" grows \\"heavier and harder to hold,\\" only to describe his \\"neck breaking\\" under the boulder's pressure. In conclusion he asks the listener whether he should \\"give up\\" or \\"live up to the expectations.\\" The speaker's dread of losing his daughter is palpapable. The logic of the metaphor could not be more explicit. <BR>   Eminem displays breathtaking literary skill in \\"My daddy's gone crazy.\\" He uses his gifts for rhyme, alliteration and repition to produce a seamlessly connected sequence of images. The speaker transitionsfrom posturing about his talent as a rapper to wailing in agony upon his uncle's grave in the space of a few lines. The speaker reveals how easy it is to \\"misinterept\\" his \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" lyrics. Eminem adroitly exploits \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" through the speaker's promise to \\"yank his teeth\\" and \\"slice his gums\\" before ever \\"biting his tongue.\\" The verbs (\\"yank,\\" \\"slice,\\" \\"bite\\") are razor sharp and as a result the central conceit is vividly and sensuously conveyed. Eminem rhetorically situates the threat to \\"slice my gums\\" after \\"bite my tongue,\\" which allows him to inifinitely extend his series of hypothetical propositions. The speaker promises to \\"get struck by lightning twice at once\\" and \\"die and come back as Vanilla's Ice's son.\\" This conceits vanish for a few lines only to resurface, for transformed psychological insight and extraordinary emotional power, in the speaker's description of himself standing on \\"Ronnie's grave, screaming at the sky,\\" while at the same time \\"clouds gather\\" ominously above the graveyard. Eminem uses the \\"lightning\\" to transition from the little girl \\"inside of a plane aimed at the world trade\\" to an ashen graveyard. The breadth of this journey across psychological and physical landscapes rivals Whitman in its breadth and heterogeneity.  <BR>   The logic of Eminem's lyrics falters at times. In \\"Hallie's Song\\" he asserts that the \\"years\\" he has \\"wasted\\" are \\"nothing to\\" the \\"tears\\" he has tasted.\\" He means that the time he felt he wasted with Kim pales in comparison with the pain he felt throughout the tenure of their relationship.  \\"Years,\\" a time span, and \\"tears,\\" symptoms of grief, cannot be quantitatively compared. Eminem lacks the persistence to make this comparison fruitful. He needs to specify what he \\"wasted\\" during the years even if it means he has to search for another rhyme. The metaphor, as it stands, is meaningless.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't care about where the strokes came from or why they are making their music. I just know it sounds great. Casablancas has a absolutely great voice, and one or both of their guitar players rips out some great, albeit short, solos. Everything about them is old-style, but who cares? They can whoop on most new metal or punk band out there. Not all metal and punk, I have serious respect for black sabbath, marilyn manson, and the ramones, among others. The strokes are awesome, no matter what the 1 star people say.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The 10 part series is a testament to the men of Easy Company for their heroics as well as to all men and women who stood together during a dangerous period of world history.<br />The interspersing of actual members of Easy Co. and the story line brought to life the joys, fears and lives of the men.  The ensemble cast does a remarkable job of bringing to life events of the past and recreating the events.  The only down side is the often cartoonish southern drawls of the British actors.  All else is flawless!
B000002BUY|5.0|This album is so underrated and I don't understand why. I'm a huge Incubus fan, and this cd is by far the best out of all of them. Incubus is the ONLY band with a DJ that actually has talent (Linkin Park? You have GOT to be kidding me). This album is for people that are more into hardcore funk metal type of music. \\"Make yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\" are also complete masterpieces, but this one tops them all.<br />I'll go through and rate each song just like all of the others:<br />1. Redefine - 4.5/5 - This song is the perfect opener for the album. Brandon Boyd sorta raps on this one, but the lyrics are great.<BR>2. Vitamin - 3/5 - I don't care for this song. It's not horrible, but it just gets on my nerves a bit.<BR>3. New Skin - 5/5 - This song is incredible. It's about how society is a scab, and the only way for it to improve is to pick the scab and let the new skin breathe. An Incubus classic.<BR>4. Idiot Box - 5/5 - Probably my favorite song on the album. The lyrics are of pure genius. In this song, the term \\"Idiot Box\\" means a television.<BR>5. Glass - 4/5 - Not bad. Not much to say about this one.<BR>6. Magic Medicine - 2/5 - The worst song on the album. It's extremely bizarre. It has a record of a woman reading a children's story throughout the whole song. Creative, yet boring.<BR>7. A Certain Shade Of Green - 5/5 - Another Incubus classic. Catchy hooks and lyrics. (Check out the acoustic version sometime. It's slower and beautiful). A pure gem.<BR>8. Favorite Things - 3/5 - It's ok.<BR>9. Summer Romance - 4/5 - A good love song. Has a cool sax solo. Other than that, nothing special.<BR>10. Nebula - 5/5 - Extremely creative song. Probably my 2nd favorite song on here. Pretty hardcore, too.<BR>11. Deep Inside - 2/5 - BORING! SKIP IT!<BR>12. Calgone - 4/5 - Pretty good. The 2nd heaviest song on here.<BR>Bonus Track - No rating. It drags on too long.<br />As you can see, this album is pretty damn good. This album makes all of the other \\"nu-metal\\" acts look sillyand uneducated. Get this cd. It's destined to be a classic.
1567302017|5.0|Immensely powerful, disturbing, accurate and heart-rending. The most absorbing production relating to the Holocaust that I have seen.<br />Here the horrors of the Holocaust are presented by real people in real time. Holocaust survivors, their captors, torturers & executioners are all interviewed on camera.<br />Any detachment that the reader might have felt in reading books on the subject is destroyed as everything comes to life before your eyes. To actually see apparently 'ordinary' human beings who were responsible for such atrocities, speak about these events with such 'matter of fact', carefree abandon makes one's blood run cold.<br />This footage is all the more real to me, having personally visited most of the concentration camps referred to and having seen at first hand what is being referred to. Nevertheless, this footage will shock even the most hardened viewer & educate the least informed amongst us on the subject. It really is a 'must view' on the Holocaust.<br />It is quite lengthy, some 9 hours in all & with subtitles, yet this does not diminish from it's veracity and impact. It is such a shame that this production is not required viewing in our schools. We all need to be educated about this period in our not so recent history, before it happens again.<br />Recommended.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|I seem to recall a time, in the not too distant past, when vampire movies actually made a little effort to be scary.  This is no longer the case, apparently, for nowadays the vampires themselves have become so image-conscious that they just can't seem to be bothered with anything as mundane as conjuring up a few goose bumps for a thrill-starved audience.  These modern-day Draculas need to devote all their time and energy to proving just how hip, cool and trendy they really are.  Take the bloodsuckers in \\"Blade II.\\"  In this sequel to the highly successful 1998 original, the vampires all talk in the vernacular of streetwise thugs and sport the very latest in grunge attire (one would think that there would be at least a few old timers in their ranks who would rather don a Bela Lugosi-type tuxedo than a torn jeans and leather ensemble, but, apparently, in this day and age, vampirism has become strictly a young person's game).<br />In this film, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the laconic \\"half-vampire\\" who, unlike his full-blooded brethren, can move around in the daylight.  Blade has dedicated his life to defending mankind against the deadly assaults from the world's apparently enormous vampire population.  However, in \\"Blade II,\\" a new twist has been added.  Blade learns that a new form of vampire - a \\"super vampire,\\" one that feeds on vampires as well as humans - has suddenly been unleashed onto the earth, and the mere conventional vampires are forced to enlist the aid of their own archenemy to help defeat this new strain.<br />Because \\"Blade II\\" ends up substituting action for suspense, the movie quickly turns into a monotonous series of nonstop chase scenes, gun battles and kickboxing sequences - all filmed so darkly that it is often hard to fully see what is happening on screen.  I guess we are paying the price for the success of \\"The Matrix,\\" since every action movie worth its salt now has to feature at least half a dozen martial arts sequences to make the action-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.  The makers of \\"Blade II\\" also rely so heavily on gross-out effects and state-of-the-art gizmos and gadgets that they all but drain the life's blood out of the film.  With no one for us to identify with or care about, there is really no way for the story to generate any actual suspense.  We sit and watch, admiring of the technical aspects of the film, perhaps, but completely unabsorbed in the action on screen.  In \\"Blade II,\\" the vampires, super-vampires and pseudo-vampires, by waging what is little more than a two-hour long gun battle, end up boring us long before the sun peeks over the horizon.tion-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.

B0000203Y5|5.0|I love a documentary. One on Cuba would be facinating but the addition of the histories, lifestyles, and opinions of the members of the BVSC in one DVD makes for an eye-opening, humbling view of the artistically-honed Cuban muscians. You visit their homes, meet their loved ones, see Cuba from their eyes. The differences between Americans and Cubans is impressive. To watch this DVD is to become more intimately aquainted with peace with one's self, humility, and humor about life. It rounds out the music disc in ways that are impossible to describe -- perhaps something like having a frank, private two-hour conversation Sinatra then having front row tickets and observing him sing. Just replace Sinatra with Ferrer. If you like BVSC, the making of it will touch and delight you -- and possibly much more imporantly -- make you grateful for the small things in life. Highly recommended.

B00004I9VE|5.0|Were you to young to have danced the night away to in the 80s? Didn't get to learn to moonwalk to it? You're not too young to rediscover perfection. Thrill your friends anew with your chic musical 'fluence. Every song is great. The CD has beautiful flow from one track to the next. It's a CD you throw on when you're doing the laundry and want the hour to fly -- or your pals are over for quesadas and you're getting ready to go out. Or -- my favorite place to hear it -- while you're soaking in the tub, sticking your toe up the faucet, singing and smiling. I love this one. Get it for yourself, get it for someone who's never heard it before. And let 'em slow-jam.
B000002GGU|4.0|No messing about with Bryan Adams, he has a distinctive rock and roll voice and he uses it to full effect on this album.  Kicking off with a trio of danceable rock numbers including Run to You then slowing it down before The summer of 69 which must surely feature on most Greatest Rock compilations that are produced. The album features the Tina Turner duet It's only love as well as a couple of credible ballads.  Why Bryan Adams never achieved the recognition for his work i don't know but when you listen to this and realise it was recorded nearly 20 years ago, your estimation of the man goes up.

030716327X|5.0|I bought this book for my youngest son who is 11 months old.  The first time we read it, he laughed out loud when he saw his reflection in the little mirror in the book.  The second time we read it, he knew to touch the bunny's fur & Daddy's scratchy beard and put his finger through Mummy's ring on his own.  For some reason this book holds his attention like no other.  As others have mentioned, it is not very durable, however, I just keep it in my room to read at bedtime, I don't let him play with it. It is really a sweet little book!
0066620996|5.0|This is another book from the new trend of collecting data, and come out with a summary. Instead of having a set of guidance in mind and trying to convince the readers abuot its value, books like this one and the &quot;First, Break All the Rules&quot; did the survey and extract the common factors among the subjects.<br />I know several companies bought many copies of this book and distributed to their middle and high level managers. An easy reading that is quite useful!
B0000039QA|5.0|This album is a graceful scence of how a rapper from the slums became one of the greatest lyricist the game has ever seen. This album defines quality and inovative rap music and Notorious B.I.g. came correct on this release. This album is a must for any rap fan andit should be noted that Biggie is one ofthe best MC's to ever get in the rap game.
B00000064G|4.0|This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like \\"Radio\\", \\"Which Will\\" and the well-known title track. \\"Know\\" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of \\"Parasite\\" has an almost hypnotic quality. \\"Ride\\" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. \\"From The Morning\\" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic.
0316666343|5.0|This s a wonderful book about the grief process and what happens when someone losses an immediate family member to unexpected circumstances.  <BR>Unexpected or not family members all deal with their grief in a very personal way.  <BR>This book touches on some of them.  As someone who has lived through it and experienced it I can say that this book does a VERY good job at getting the point across.
B00000064E|4.0|My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation, i.e. Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar, piano and bass; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement, and; Cello Song, a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello, bass and congas. I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours, a brooding little number. As with all Drake's work, the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies, where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places.
B00005JL96|5.0|Who would have thought the story of a fugitive, mass-destructive alien crashlanding on Earth could give lessons in the struggle of low-income families, biological engineering, how hard it is to grow up \\"different\\", and the meaning of family? It does it all and more in Lilo & Stitch. This is the first Disney movie since The Lion King to inspire that deep-down connection that we yearn for and find very seldom anymore in me. The Hawaiian ambience is beautifully rendered with music and the watercolor backgrounds, and shows that it isn't idyllic in paradise, with Nani desperately trying to hold down a job and support her problematic little sister Lilo. Then enter Stitch, aka Experiment 626, a bio-engineered alien lifeform programmed to destroy. Escaping from exile on an asteroid belt, he crashlands on Hawaii, where he is taken in to an animal shelter--and adopted by Lilo. Meanwhile, the scientist that created Stitch and an alien Earth enthusiast are sent to reclaim the experiment. It is action-packed, but the story is cohesive and drags you in. It proves that everyone deserves a second chance and that \\"ohaha means family, and family means that no one is left behind.\\"

B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson is the craftiest pop opportunist to come down the pike since Malcolm McLaren. Culling rock elements that have been hammered down by others, he has cultivated a clever pastiche that does a suitably lewd -- if not particularly inventive -- job of preserving shock rock tradition. Now that he and his band have milked their kinship with Nine Inch Nails for all it was worth on Antichrist Superstar, the motley crew has moved on to fresh blood.<br />Mechanical Animals, meticulously produced by Michael Beinhorn, unwinds like a high-tech tribute to the dissociative David Bowie of the '70s. The cover art features Manson airbrushed into a creepy androgyne that looks like Aladdin Sane with breast implants. Inside, a space-age glam shot of Manson emblazoned with \\"Omega and the Mechanical Animals\\" is an unmistakable reference to Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The musical connections are just as pronounced. \\"The Dope Show\\" smacks of \\"Cracked Actor\\"; \\"Rock Is Dead\\" resurrects \\"The Jean Genie\\"; \\"The Speed of Pain\\" is a recombobulated \\"Space Oddity\\"; and \\"I Don't Like Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\\" hints at \\"Fame\\" with its slack groove and a conspicuous line about 15 minutes of shame.<br />Beinhorn, whose specialty is tidying up unruly rock for easy radio consumption (see Soul Asylum, Soundgarden, Hole, etc.), provides just the right touch of studio gloss and coaxes out Manson's sensitive side in the form of moody ballads. The acousticisms of \\"Coma White\\" contrast nicely with the dark music, and Manson does his best Nick Cave on \\"Fundamentally Loathsome,\\" but crooning isn't really his cup of tea. The strongest tracks -- \\"I Want to Disappear\\" and \\"New Model No. 15\\" -- cut the gloom with doses of new wave cheesiness instead.<br />Still I think this album is great. The music is amazing and the lyrics are beautiful.....
B00006LLNU|5.0|If you like Agaetus Byrjun by Sigur Ros, you will like this new one.<br />It retains all the good qualities of that first album--the deep emotionality, the sweeping melodicism, the unconventional instruments, the touching vocals.  And it adds an amazing amount of MOMENTUM.  The tunes grow and grow and build until they reach an almost overpowering force.<br />Also, the percussion on this album is enormously strong and distinctive.<br />The singer's voice--male but very androgynous--starts out shakily, almost creaking, but even this shakiness becomes a strength, because the voice gains sureness as it continues, and gets more and more confident.  So the initial weakness becomes touching and appealing, like a child's first shaky steps that grow more balanced by the moment.<br />A truly amazing album, like the first.<br />Sigur Ros is the new Pink Floyd--though they really do not sound like Floyd.  They have Floyd's sureness of approach and great, thematic, compositional skills.
B00006M183|4.0|In less than a week, over 100 reviews are posted for the album. Rather than go song-by-song to describe it for you, I'll just review it in its present context.<br />\\"Riot Act\\" is a bittersweet album for me, because it cements a painful truth: Pearl Jam will never write another \\"Ten\\". The best any fan can hope for is more \\"Riot Act\\".<br />Hey!  There's nothing wrong with wanting the old voice and the finely-crafted songs from \\"Ten\\".  Those who revel in the self-congratulatory condescension of damning the old-school adherents appear to be snobs.  Forget them.  Like what you like, and take each album on its own merits.  And if you still think \\"Ten\\" was their best album, your opinion is no worse than anyone else's.<br />This isn't to say \\"Riot Act\\" is a terrible. It is merely good in many places, and shines less than it could. I'll never be happy with Eddie's now-annoying monotonal low registers, and I think the band takes a few shortcuts that ought not to be taken.<br />Will you like the music? Probably. Pearl Jam is a rock and roll band, successfully transcending the grunge label and fully migrated to their ultimate destination.  If you've come this far in their journey, I think you'll be happy with album.

0788821075|2.0|This movie basically put me to sleep. It seemed like it was 4 hrs. long! I was disappointed. This is the first time I've seen this movie after all these years of hearing all positive things about it. But I guess everyone's taste is different. I laughed only a couple times. And if it wasn't for the funny couple things Julia Roberts said or did I would have only given it one star.
0140288503|5.0|Murphy's Law in Combat<br />Reviewer: MoAddams from Terra Firma, USA<br />At the end of Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden said his goal for this book was to write a comprehensive account of what happened to US soldiers at Mogadishu, Somalia; and he wanted this book to read like a novel. He achieved his goal and then some.<br />I should say up front that I knew very little about the &quot;art&quot; of war, and I knew absolutely nothing about the technological equipment that's now used to fight battles. I did need to make a cheat sheet for myself to keep track of the military terms with which I was not familiar and which I kept forgetting. Once I did that, I found I could not put this book down. The story is that compelling.<br />Thanks to Mark Bowden's excellent research, all the events of the Mogadishu battle are very clearly described. The writing is so good and, where it needs to be, so graphic that reading this account is almost like being there. Given so much technical detail, that kind of writing takes a superb talent.<br />Now that the US is considering invading Iraq, Black Hawk Down is an important book to read. I don't think people who have never experienced war on this level can begin to tell someone else what to think or feel about further invasions. I think it is important for US citizens to have some idea of what we would be asking our military to do should the decision be made to invade Iraq. I also think it is important to understand the perspective of those who have agreed to fight these battles on behalf of our country. Their honor, bravery, and loyalty are nothing short of remarkable in situations such as those which present themselves in times of war. I think it is important that a country support those who fight in war on their behalf. Black Hawk Down makes it clear just how much pride we deserve to have in our military and the debt of gratitude we owe to them.
B000002KHY|3.0|I still own this on vinyl, and it was about the tenth CD I bought to replace an old LP because it was priced reasonably and contains no duds. James Taylor at his best is most enjoyable, but I have never found any of his albums, not even Sweet Baby James, to be first rate when compared to the works of a Jackson Browne. That means that I have no interest in buying any more Taylor albums even though I know a few songs from the Warner years I would like to have. Warners is not going to sell countless copies of any James Taylor CD in the future, for hardcore fans already have them all, and the rest of us have the Greatest Hits. It is time for Warners to release an expanded Greatest Hits (perhaps titling it Retrospective), spurring thousands of people like me to buy another JT product from them. Add another 6 to 9 songs ('Hey Mr. That's Me Up On the Jukebox' is an obvious choice), and Greatest Hits could be a thorough overview of Taylor's most creative period.
B00000JMQE|5.0|The ability to revisit childhood classics can be a poisoned chalice. We all know this. There are few things more disheartening than returning to a book or a film of which you have such fond memories, only to discover that it's actually rubbish of the lowest order.<br />I rented 'Return to Oz' this weekend - and found it to be not only still fantastic, but even better than I remember it being.<br />I first saw this film at the cinema when I was five years old. At the time, I was thrilled and freaked out in equal measure; watching it again now, at a remove of seventeen years, I get the same emotions. It's wonderfully twisted: Dorothy undergoing shock treatment to get rid of her dreams of Oz, the shattered yellow brick road, Princess Mombi with her interchangeable heads (and the headless dancing girl statues that she harvested them from!). There are no twee songs or overly-optimistic fluffiness here. Well, a little of the latter, but I can forgive a happy ending when the journey there is so deliciously dark and uncompromising. A genuine sense of menace pervades the whole film; Dorothy's victory over Mombi and the Nome King never feels like a foredrawn conclusion.<br />And the Wheelers are just as creepy as they ever were...<br />Fairuza Balk turns in an excellent performance as a brave, intelligent little girl determined to do whatever it takes to save what she believes in; and there is a real sense of character development by the end of the film that doesn't consist solely of \\"Aren't we all better people now?\\"<br />Distinctly creepy and disturbingly clever, today just as it was for a five-year-old in 1985.<br />But why-oh-why isn't available in PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD? I want my own copy...!

B000068TPN|5.0|After all those terrible years of \\"Deer Hunterish\\" drivel and \\"Apocalyptic\\" nonsense, Hollywood has finally, if (probably) temporarily, acceded to that fact that there is nothing glorious in the lot of the soldier other than the fraternity and special respect of a fellow soldier.  With almost no nod to the steaming domestic politics of the 1960s other than those that directly affect the soldiers and their families (or any contemporary politics either - how refreshing), \\"We Were Soldiers\\" does a pretty fair and honest job of exposing both the rubies and the warts of a combat soldier's life.  Thankfully, most of the gratuitous machoisms that the entertainment industry finds so entertaining in war flicks are absent.<br />The 1st Cav (the unit that is the subject of \\"We Were Soldiers\\") was the cutting edge of air-mobility for most of the Vietnam conflict - and, having served with the Gerry Owen bunch, they never seemed to loose their special can-do spirit.  Much of what was learned about combat assaults, extractions, coordination of multiple levels of tac-air, aerial rocket artillery, hunter-killer teams and highly mobile ground based artillery, was pioneered in real-time by the Cav and quickly shared with the Infantry divisions who deployed to SE Asia in the next year or two.  \\"We Were Solders\\" does a pretty good job of outlining the metamorphosis of 11th Air Assault at Fort Benning, Georgia into the 1st Cav, and it's subsequent deployment into Vietnam as America ramped up its ground efforts beyond the badly stretched Green Berets, and other military advisors.  (BTW:  The area, Kelly Hill, at Ft. Benning where the real 11th Air Assault was formed, was also the same area where much of John Wayne's \\"Green Beret\\" was filmed).<br />Special kudos also to \\"We Were Soldiers\\" for doing a pretty fair job of showing the sometimes harsh realities of the life of the military family (the rather sterile \\"Top Gun\\" is the only other recent film I can think of that has taken the time to try to explore the often forgotten heroes back home...).  The military family, regardless of the rank of the soldier, seldom enjoys the predictable, geographically stable character of their civilian counter-parts.  I remember those years well, and \\"We Were Soldiers\\" does a pretty good job of showing why military families get to know the local U-Haul dealer so well.  More telling, of course, is the burdens, frustrations and pure fright that come with having a loved-one deployed.  Those families didn't carry protest signs during the 60's, instead they carried letters to the mailbox - some will never know what a large part they played in keeping \\"their\\" soldier going. <br />Very good flick - gives a deeply personal, fairly genuine and somewhat painful look at the life of the American soldier.
B00006LI4S|2.0|I really didn't like this DVD.  The music is very slow, and very depressing, and very uninteresting. I also don't believe that Mr. Gilmour's voice has held up very well.  I think he chose a couple of songs which are clearly out of his vocal range such as the one with the French title.  (However, he did sing well on about 5 of the selections.)<br />The guitar work wasn't as bad, but his playing wasn't very expressive.  It was almost like a dry run through and lacked emotion.  I like much of his past work, but this DVD just doesn't do his talent justice.  He is capable of much better.

0385508417|5.0|This was the perfect book for me to read on a cold, wet, UGLY November day.  It was light-hearted and funny, and I agree with every one else... it's destined to be a made for TV movie.  I know I'd watch it :).
B00006CXXU|5.0|Without any hesitation, this is the best CD of 2002.  Songs in this album are uplifting, meaningful, and \\"beautiful.\\"  This album is definintely stripped of all the fake pop-music shelterings, and is remodified into a CD which has meanings and thoughts.  Stripped consists of soul(Impossible), R&B(can't hold us down), hiphop(Dirrty), rock(Fighter), and ballads(Voice Within, Beautiful).<BR>* The ones that are in parenthesis are the best songs on their categories in this album. <br />Keep in mind to open your mind, when you listen to music.  That's how you become a true critic of music, or not just music but everything in this world.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I hate to admit that I bought this CD after hearing only two cuts but that is what I did. One night I was in the kitchen fixing a cup of tea. I had just come from the upstairs. The television was on but I was not paying any attention to what was going on. Then I heard it: a voice so distinct yet familiar that I stopped doing what I was doing and went into the media room sat down and watched this young woman play and sing. That was enough for me. I promptly went out and bought this CD. There is not a weak song on this CD. Nora Jones reminds me a lot of a young Carole King:  she has the ability to write, play and perform her own music. She also does quite well with songs made popular by other artists. There is a richness here that is rare. A richness that is not as obvious in the music of most of todays popular artists. Although I admit that I discovered this artist by accident, I am most pleased with my discovery. Of course, now that I am familiar with her music I have learned that presently Nora Jones is quite popular : her music is everywhere and rightly so. COME AWAY WITH ME is a must own CD.
0553573411|5.0|My first foray into Robin Hobb's literary world was the book Fool's Errand--> at the recommendation of George RR Martin's website. It (of course) was very good.  In fact, it was jolly well enough to compell me to read the originating Farseer trilogy.  The first book (Assassin's Apprentice) was OK-- a 3.5 star effort-- a good start to a series.<br />Royal Assassin, however, is a different beast.  Whereas Assassin's Apprentice was a good, but not great, beginning, Royal Assassin is the consummate trilogy midpoint.  A 5-star effort in every sense (think: \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" kind of mid-trilogy effort), leaving disappointment only in it  ending & heaving empathic protagonist-despair.  <br />Both expected, of course-- being the calling card of a trilogy-- but also excellently implemented.<br />Are there hairs to split?  Of course.  The Fool is, perhaps, way too heavy with the ranting which, empathetically, is a huge stepdown from his portrayal in book 1; Regal, a pleasant villain, is portrayed as both amazingly vainglorious and treachoroulsy thorough-> a good character point, but, in my eyes, left slightly lacking in portrayal; Molly, accurately--to fault-- painted in puppy-dog/first-love love eyes... but these are minor quibbles.<br />Again, though, the book is a good read, solid read.  It is a strong step forward from its predecessor and left me wanting more.  Those are sure signs of an investment well made.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I loved Deep Space Nine and aside from growing up on another love, TNG, I would have to put DS9 right up there with TNG as the best Star Trek series' ever!  The reviewers I've seen here are RIGHT!  DS9 was SO under-rated and looked down upon as the ugly middle child it HURTS!!!!!  It trekked through space in a way never conceived before.  The new civilizations trekked to DS9 instead of the other way around and the show explored the strange new worlds of an awesome tapestry of characters.  I could go on for a VERY long time, but most of all I wanted to post my praise of this AWESOME series and bring the news to all of you.
0380789035|4.0|the book will take you away whether you want to be taken or not. it reads like a dream.... it feels like being swept out to sea by a strong undercurrent, and you know yer supposed to be dead but you remain alive under water by some miracle and you get to see a whole different world pass before your eyes.... finally the sun comes up and yer allowed to surface.... and you want to drown yourself again but you know it's over and you're changed and it would be difficult to go back. it's the saddest moment in your life but you take a deep breath and smile. the only thing is, i thought the ending didn't quite live up to all that build up.... but read it!
B000065U1N|4.0|It is interesting to read some of the other reviews for this movie.  Yes, it is a movie with little character development and dialogue.  However, it is probably about as close to the real thing any movie has ever come before.  Only a small part of our population has ever been in the military or know very much about it.  The people in the military take their jobs seriously.  They do what they are told and they watch out for each other.  You see that in this movie.<br />Black Hawk Down is a violent movie that leads you through the events of a mission gone bad.  It shows the failure in leadership and lack of ability in making a good decision.  This movie is a good movie to learn about what not to do in a crisis.  Don't have your people drive through the worst part of the battle twice.  Find other alternatives.  Do the best you can.  The people on the ground did just that, the best they could and heroes they all are.<br />It is not for us to discuss whether they should have been there or not.  Save that for the philosophy class.  The actors in the movie did a great job portraying the different people.  Overall, this is a pretty good movie.  If you want to see what war is like, watch this movie.  If you want character development and all that, then watch Titanic.

B000002UVX|5.0|After continuing pressure from his critics to play with an all Black group, Jimi Hendrix finally formed the Band of Gypsies to accomplish just that.  The band's African roots are reflected in much more than simply the members' skin color though and this ethnic consciousness is used to invent a new sound that draws equally and prominently from every Black musical style imaginable.  Dropping the more straightforward rock approach sometimes taken by the Experience, the loose, limber band of Gypsies is as deeply ingrained in free jazz and funk as The Beatles style psychedelia.  Like any Hendrix CD, \\"Band of Gypsies\\" boasts breathtaking extended guitar passages and heartfelt vocals, but unlike many of the Experience albums, Hendrix's current associates seem much more vital to the process.  Even though Mitch Mitchell was always an admirable drummer and Noel Redding was consistently a solid bass player, the smooth, sleek rhythms of Buddy Miles and Billy Cox seem to compliment Hendrix's sonic licks in a much more irreplaceable way, especially when coupled with Miles' beautiful one of a kind voice.  On a technical level, \\"The Band of Gypsies\\" album perfectly captures a number of songs performed during 3 of the band's sets at the Fillmore East and the impressively clean sound quality gives it a nice studio sheen while still keeping the live energy intact.  Expanding and changing Hendrix's ever evolving style in unprecedented ways, the Band of Gypsies was an important stage in Hendrix's musical career and the music they made easily ranks among his best work.  In fact, the only disadvantage to this CD would be that the 2 disc \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" set released after Jimi's death is a much more comprehensive collection than the 6 song \\"Band of Gypsies\\" album, but if you don't want to fork over the extra cash for a 2 CD set, \\"Band of Gypsies\\" is well worth the time and money.
0140177396|4.0|An outstanding book.  This book is a decent look at humanity.  It is a simple explanation of human nature.  All of these are descriptions of a novel I recently read by the name, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by a well-known author John Steinbeck.  I would rate this book 8 on a scale of 10 because I learned so much about the way we treat others and their reactions, told through a man who has had much experience with the subject.  Lennie, a big dumb, jock, was born slow, mentaly incapable of reacting to daily life.  After George, a caring yet riggid man befriends him early in child hood, the two become traveling partners and best buddies.  George becomes weary of Lennie's childish ways and misachievous antics, which continually causes the pair trouble and forces them to skip around the country.<BR>    \\"That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a    quarter mile.  We're gonna go in an' see the boss.  Now, look-- I'll give him the work tickets, but you ain't gonna say a word.  You jus' stand there and son't say nothing.  If he finds out what a crazy ... you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk we're set.  Ya got that?\\"<BR>This story is special because all aspects of diction, from all characters are described in simple English.  The story had no useless vocabulary or pointless explaining, just a plain dexcription of the people.  The story also uses vivid imagery when George tells Lennie about how they were going to own a ranch and Lennie can raise rabbits.  Steinbeck reveals the simle truth about racism, dgradation, and jelousy.  People in the book are struggling to overcome an obstacle that holds them back.  At their final stop, they meet all types of people, which teach them about diversity and how to deal with it.  The story's resolution reveals how humans deal with the sorrow of our society.  The outcome may shock us, yet it seems just in it's own irony.  I sincerely suggest this book to those looking to explore humanity and to thosewho would like to know what friendship and loyalty is and if you liked \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" or \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", you will like this book because I, Jamil Faruque a student of Falls Church HS, have read both of these books which shows similarities with \\"Of Mice and Men\\"
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam is regarded as the last remaining great Seattle band by many people,and while that may not fly in some people's opinion,their new album \\"Riot Act\\" will surely opened people's eyes and ears more to find that the band can still play well no matter what century they're in. This album is by no means in the same legendary status as \\"Ten\\", or \\"Vitalogy\\" or even a return to the rocking Pearl Jam people expected to hear, but it is by far one of the best pure rock record to have ever come out and a songwriter lover's haven, if you're into that kind of things. The album opened up with \\"Cant Keep\\", a good opener in the tradition of \\"Once\\" and \\"Go\\", but sounding more like \\"Sometimes\\". The album then picked up its creative juices and flows pretty well, despite the range of  creative sounds presented in the album. The best song on the album is easily \\"I Am Mine\\", the first single, and listening to it over and over again makes me wonder how Eddie Vedder could come up with  incredibly written songs like that. But that song is by no means the album's only ace, what with such keepers as \\"Love Boat Captain\\" (great piano work in the vein of \\"Black\\"; also a tribute to a great Beatles song, which you'll find out once you listen to it), \\"Thumbing My Way\\" (perhaps the best song lyrically on the album),\\"Bushleaguer ( a little spoken word/song rant about our Texan leader) and \\"You Are\\" (Matt Cameron's best song out of the three put out on the album), this album doesnt disappoint at all in the song selection. I'm very happy to see more of the band's contribution (rather than mostly Eddie's) to the songs in this one. I mean, i didnt know Matt Cameron could write a song like \\"you are\\", play guitar and drums on it, and have it sound like a cross between a Radiohead song and a latter-day Pearl Jam tune, which is a very good thing. I guess Cameron used his instrumental and songwriting expertise from his Soundgarden and Wellwater Conspiracy  stints well in this album. Overall, i really recommend this album for the fact that its one of the greatest musical rock album in the last few years,and easily Pearl Jam's best since Matt Cameron came on to the band. It may not be as exciting as \\"Ten\\" or as wildly experimental as \\"No Code\\", but after the  near impactless showing that was \\"Binaural\\", \\"Riot Act\\" is definitely a step up and a move in the right direction for Pearl Jam. So  go ahead, buy this album, and let the Rioting begin!
B00004Z459|1.0|Does this garbage actually interest teenage boys these days?<BR>Whiny little kids with blaring guitars? And they try to rap over all of it! What is this world coming to?

B000002SYG|4.0|Culture Club have many compilations in print, most of them ruined by having Boy George's later inferior solo work tacked on to it. This budget-line CD is really all the casual fan needs, containing all of the band's Top 40 hits, including the much-maligned (but still fun) \\"The War Song\\". <br />As is the case with most budget line CD's, I would imagine that the sound quality here isn't as good as on some of their more \\"proper\\" best-ofs. If you're that big of an audiophile, the recent \\"VH-1 Storytellers/Greatest Moments\\" collection would probably serve you better. <br />My only complaint - the failed single \\"Mistake No. 3\\" (a decent ballad) isn't here. Small error though. This is a very good Culture Club greatest hits set.

B000060MY6|5.0|This film oddity from acclaimed director David Lynch is incredibly strange, but very entertaining. It's like watching a strange dream unfold before your eyes. There really isn't any sort of concentration on a plot here. There are devices injected into the film that look like a story, but there is no real direction that the movie takes us. It's enormously hard to follow and nearly impossible to decipher, but the watchability factor makes this flick a definite 5-star. Creepy and very confusing.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I do not like teen pop.  I never have, I never will but, when I heard her sing Beautiful, I thought hmmmmm, sounds like she is growing up.  This whole CD is well written and different.  Different meaning that her voice takes on as many pitches as Mariah Carey.  To buy the CD, I had to get past the part that she is half naked on the cover.  I thought maybe she was confirming many peoples' view that she is [loose], but when I listened to this \\"outspoken\\" CD I realized that she is nothing like her first CD. She literally has \\"Stripped\\" herself of what Teen-idol producers want. Christina has become a woman in all aspects.  This CD will probably be in almost every womans CD collection, or at least it should be.  It's empowering to us.
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book yet. The Perks of Being a Wallflower was about a lonely, shy boy, Charlie. The book is written in letters to a friend that he does not know and visaversa. But as the reader, the reader takes on this role as the \\"Dear Friend.\\" I, the reader, became the one Charlie was writing these letters to. It felt like he was telling ME his issues. The book relates completely to the real world that the average teenager goes through. It is filled with quotes that you can cary with you and remember for a life time. It makes you feel like you have someone that is going through the same dating issues as you, or school issues, or drug issues, etc...<BR>      Read this book, i promise you that it will change your life.

B000065U1N|4.0|As everybody now knows, Black Hawk Down is the true story of the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place in October 1993, when an American elite force carried out their mission (to abduct two lieutenants of the notorious Somalian warlord Mohammad Aidid) and ended up in the longest post Vietnam land battle involving American soldiers. During this ferocious gun battle 18 American soldiers were killed and 73 injured, whilst over 500 Somali gunmen also lost their lives.<br />Ridley Scott, hot off the heels of Gladiator, pulls no punches in his direction of this tragic fiasco, as he provides us with 135 minutes of ear shattering, stomach-churning, war is hell, all out action. There to the story is that American troops are on a peace-keeping mission trying to support the supply of food to the people of Somalia, who are being starved as a result of the local warlords commandeering all the Red Cross relief efforts. However, as is usually the case, their efforts are compromised by politics and they have to watch on helplessly as the Somalian guerrillas turn their guns own their own starving people. As a result, a plan is formulated by the army to enter the hostile capital of Mogidishu in broad daylight to abduct two of Mohammad Aidid's most senior aides. However, even before the mission can begin, the plan is hamstrung by Washington politicians who limit the mission's aerial support and firepower. And so the mission begins with the Delta Force and Rangers but everything starts to unravel when one of the helicopters involved in the mission, the said Black Hawk of the title, gets shot down in the middle of the city and the whole mission begins to tragically unravel.<br />  Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have provided a 135 minute deafening assault on the senses. The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is impeccable and in a strange way aesthetically pleasing and the cast, led by Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana (The Hulk) and Ewan McGregor, is perhaps implausibly good looking and McGregor's first attempt at an American accent is not altogether consistent or convincing. However, the aesthetic appeal of three of Hollywood's hottest young stars is balanced by the chunky Tom Sizemore and the so ugly (only a mother could love that face) Ewen Bremner of Trainspotting fame, who actually provides a stand out supporting performance and an American accent which impressively belies his Scottish roots. Also particularly impressive in another supporting performance is Jason Isaacs (Event Horizon, The Patriot) as Captain Mike Steele.<br />One of the most refreshing but also most frustrating things about Black Hawk Down is its lack of political context. There is no explanation as to whose decision it was to limit the mission and no finger pointing at those that inevitably made the decision to pull out of Somalia. There is also very little background character development about any of the soldiers with perhaps the exception of Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), who is presented as being somewhat pragmatic and anti-war. The movie does not follow the traditional formula of war movies that focuses upon ordinary men overcoming great odds through glorious sacrifice to triumph with flag-waving patriotism. Instead it focuses upon professional soldiers drawn together by a common aim to stay alive, free of the usual moral justifications of being a soldier in the first instance. It is neither anti-war, nor anti-army. It is about comradeship through necessity, kill or be killed and in Black Hawk Down there is plenty of both. Or as Eric Bana's character puts it \\"It's about the man next to you; that's all there is.\\" Ultimately, whether you enjoy Black Hawk Down or not will depend on whether you like war movies and whether or not you like them to be gritty and realistic.

B00005A0V0|3.0|This was my first introduction to Caravan, and I was really eager to finally hear them. It was not worth the wait. While all the songs are well done and the musicianship is quite good, the album is just....boring. Seriously, these guys make the Moody Blues sound raucous by comparison. &quot;Golf Girl&quot; is a silly song (not that there's anything wrong with that) and &quot;Love to Love You&quot; is forgettable. &quot;Winter Wine&quot; is a nice, mystical piece to fall asleep with. The title track is decent, but the  monotonous &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot; is unbearable...22 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Maybe their other albums have more of a pulse?
0743216458|5.0|Having read many books about the battles and wars throughout the history of the world I find that Band of Brothers gives a remarkable insight into the bonds of the frontline combat soldier. Ambrose is truly a national treasure.This book caused a great stirring of emotion in me from lauphing out loud to breaking down into tears. It also showed me a great story about true heros, like major Dick Winters when he and members of easy took a battery of 88s in Normandy.I have enjoyed this book many times and hope to do so many times more.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act is Pearl Jam's stongest album as a whole.  Every song is remarkable.  Riot Act may not contain a single individual song as powerful and raw as say, 'Not For You' (Vitalogy).  However, as an entire album, it is their stongest.  You won't be disappointed.
B000005HLV|5.0|This was the very first BLACK METAL album I ever picked up. To this day I am still looking for something to top it. It is raw and it is power personified, it is everything heavy metal has built up to. I have an entire collection worth of Black Metal now and only a few songs here and there come close. This album has some of the benchmarks of the genre. Funeral Fog, Buried By Time And Dust and The Freezing Moon come to mind immedietly. <BR>  In recent years the whole scene has transformed itself toward highly trained musicians and crystal clear production. Unfortunately none of those things can match the fury of the early releases. There is something so pure about the sound of this album that it can literally change the way you look at music. It did for me, I am still looking for its equivalent.<BR>  By the way, if you are just getting into the Black Metal scene also pick up the Burzum Anthology album and stay away from that ... book Lords Of Chaos which is nothing more then sensationalistic garbage. Remember, it's all about the music, not dressing up as evil clowns and dancing around pentagrams. <BR>  I myself was writing similair music(but nowhere near the beauty of this album) in the early 90's. It was just the logical progression for people like myself who loved Venom, Motorhead, Kiss, Metallica and others. Don't let anyone convince you that some church burning wackos in Norway invented all of this. What they did do, was bring it all out in the open and give it a name. Now go out there and buy this album, if you are looking for something different in heavy music and think that it has all been done, you will not be dissapointed. It may just even change your life.
B00003CX5P|4.0|It's funny, in this day and age that a movie like this could come out and be \\"snubbed\\" the way it is.... It is perplexing to me!! This is a great movie, period, for many reasons and yet I read bad review after bad review, people calling it a \\"B\\" movie with A+ special affects. It's Star Wars for Pete Sake!!! Not one of the original movies was a literary masterpiece!! `Com on folks, lighten up and enjoy it for what it is... A Sci-Fi adventure, and it's supposed to be fun, light, \\"un-real\\" and have great special affects. This movie has those very qualities; squared!! Though I have to agree on some level that Jar Jar can get to be a little much. Also, I feel you never warm up to Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn. The only thing that I can come up with that is Jinn is a little \\"mechanical\\" in his demeanor and though he doesn't do anything to keep you FROM connecting with him, he doesn't do anything to win you over either. This could also be a direct result of Liam Neeson though. I've seen quite a few of his pictures and this is a common occurrence with the characters that he plays. Also, as a side note, I'm hoping that one of the films will delve more into the mystique of the Jedi night and the \\"Force\\". Now back to the movie... What made the first 3 so great was the \\"newness\\" that the films had! We, John Q public, had never experienced anything like it and the affects were so mind blowing that the whole experience was phenomenal!! But now, there has been so many of these types of movies; The Star Treks, Starship troopers, lost in space, etc (never mind the bombardment of space shows on TV)... That we never thought the new Star Wars would be another one in the pack; we expected it to be as ground breaking as the originals! This was an impossible feat and that's why it \\"failed\\" on some level. Also, the time between Return of the Jedi and the release of Phantom Menace probably caused the \\"larger than life\\" anticipation. It's a shame really, a good movie lost to it's own promise... The DVD is quite spectacular and one of the best as far as extras go. I'm not big on extras though; I just like the great Audio and Video. I'm a Home Theater owner and this is the very movie that fits HT!! The pod race is demo material and the luscious landscapes and horizons on the different planets are total eye candy! This is one to buy and watch over and over!  Just remember, you need to keep your mind in the same genre that the movie is in and you will fully enjoy it...

6300185249|4.0|I always come back to this movie after a few years of not having seen it, and it's fresh and funny every time! One of my all time favorite comedies, if you like the old slapstick stuff from the 30's, you should like this. What the heck happened to Tom Hanks? He used to be a hysterical comedy actor, as this movie showcases. He's become Mr. Serious, and frankly, pretty boring. I prefer him in these light comedy roles.<BR>Ah, the joys of homeownership, in this case involving everything from trees that fall at the touch of a finger, to bathtubs that fall through the floor (all time classic film moment!), to electrically challenged kitchen appliances (I recently saw a TV commercial that spoofed this scene!), not to mention racoons in the dumbwaiter, holes in the floor that trap you for hours and overall chaos.<BR>Delightful and enduringly funny!
B000004286|4.0|When I heard all of the reviews of this soundtrack and how highly everyone rated it, I knew I had to get it. Braveheart is a celtic sounding score with a lot of other Irish feel to it. The themes are superb and the orchestral performance is excellent, but for me most of the soundtrack sounded like a lot of background music with nothing, besides the themes that would stand out. Horner uses traditional Scottish and Irish instruments such as the Uillean pipes along with the Bodhran drums. He also uses his usual brass and percussion as well which any fan of Horner will instantly recognize. The tracks that were the best are &quot;Main Title&quot;, &quot;A Gift of a Thistle&quot;, &quot;The Secret Wedding&quot;, &quot;Sons of Scotland&quot;, &quot;For the Love of a Princess&quot;, &quot;Betrayal and Desolation&quot;, and the &quot;End Credits&quot;. Action music was dominant in &quot;The Battle of Stirling&quot;, &quot;Falkirk&quot;, and &quot;Mornay's Dream&quot;. By now you are probably thinking why didn't you give it 5 stars. It's mainly because the majority of the music is simply background music that, while still good, doesn't succeed nearly as well as when the majestic themes are played in their full force. Yes the themes are used a lot in the score, but that can also get a little old after a while. If debating about getting this one, I suggest that you get it. It is very long, with about 78 minutes of music on it. It is a satisfying listen on the whole, but needed a little more oomph to it.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Well, I guess if you want to be literal \\"Greatest Hits: 1970-2002\\" does offer up most of Elton John's greatest hits.  The album can not claim to be a comprehensive collection in that regard because it only provides songs written by John, meaning covers like \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" are omitted (too bad he never recorded a version of \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" that he used to play with the lights on at the end of concerts).  However, the problem from my perspective is simply that some of Elton John's best songs were not hits, which the collection recognizes by including \\"Levon,\\" which was always an FM favorite but never made it over to Top 20 AM radio.<br />Yes, picking this up is a better deal than picking up all the Elton John hits albums individually.  But liking Elton John for just his hits is really a superficial appreciation of the man and his music.  There are only seven songs in this collection from albums Elton John and Bernie Taupin put out before the double-album \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" which is the duo's high water mark.  I think I can make a pretty good argument that some of the songs released on those earlier albums but left off of this collection are better than pretty much everything that came afterwards.  We are talking about songs like \\"Skyline Pigeon,\\" \\"The King Must Die,\\" \\"The Greatest Discovery,\\" \\"Burn Down the Mission,\\" \\"Madman Across the Water,\\" and \\"Have Mercy on the Criminal.\\"  Go check out the \\"Elton John Live in Australia\\" album and see how many more of these \\"forgotten\\" songs are included instead of later \\"hits.\\"<br />The bonus material on Disc 3 is certainly a little nice touch and saves us from Kiki Dee being his only duet partner on the album.  Again, if all you want are the hits, this will suffice.  But if you want the best of Elton John take the high road and pick up his first half-dozen albums.  You will end up having more great Elton John songs in your music collection that way.
B00005T30L|1.0|Ghost World is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i can't believe someone reviewing this movie dared compare it to rushmore. I'm so sick of stupid 'indie' kids ridiculing pop culture, and thats the whole point of this movie...worthless. And on top of the stupid plot, Thora Birch is ugly and she has cankles, and those damn combat boots certainly don't make things better. My idea of a pleasant movie going experience is not ghost world, in fact in my ideal movie, none of the actors/actresses in ghost world would be present, they'd all be dead. After watching this movie, i felt like going on a murderous rampage, thats how bad it is.
B00006M183|5.0|I spend time with my music.  I take it home, unwrap it, read the liner notes, take in the experience of the album as a whole.  Then I pop the CD in and take a ride.  I am a fan of several different types of music, from pop to rock to metal to jazz, my CD collection jumps all over the place.  I am not biased towards anything.  I have though, been a Pearl Jam fan since Ten, and have every album since then, among other things such as their excellent Touring Band DVD.  So before I begin, I'd like to say that it is pointless to expect songs like \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Black\\" or \\"Rearviewmirror\\" from a band that has grown so much in the past few years.  Pearl Jam are probably not in the same places they once were, and I hope you and I aren't either.  <br />So, as I pop in the disc, I am stunned by the passion of the vocals that I hear; the swirling ringing of guitar, bass, drums and vocals that is \\"Can't Keep.\\"  Contrary to what else I have read from a few people, Eddie sounds more passionate and emotional than ever.  You can just hear the emotion quivering from his voice.  And to the person that said \\"Thumbing My Way\\" was emotionless, did you even listen or pay attention to the lyrics?  \\"All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives/choosing the shiny ones instead/I turned my back/now there's no turning back.\\"  The way Eddie sings those lines make me remember how I felt the first time I heard \\"Release.\\"  Not to mention how beautiful a composition \\"Love Boat Captain\\" is, with a melody that is bleeding with intensity not felt by other bands these days.  \\"Save You\\" is a frustrated emotional explosion \\"Too important to us/we'd be lost without you/let yourself fall/i'm right below you,\\" while in \\"1/2 Full\\" Eddie spits \\"Don't see some men as 1/2 empty/see them 1/2 full of sh*t.\\"  Yeaaaah.   <br />Even more suprisingly incredible than the lyrics is how the music sounds alive in ways that you might not expect.  Matt Cameron feels more connected with the band than in Binaural, and seems to have acheived that great 'tight-looseness' that the band had with Dave Abruzzeese back on Vs and Vitalogy.  Jeff always rocks, but Mike and Stone really work magic on this album, from beginning to end, sounding off with contrastingly interesting parts at all the right moments, such as on the bluesy rock jam \\"1/2 Full,\\" and sounding like a huge wall of sound where it's incredibly appropriate, like on the brilliant rocker \\"Get Right.\\"  <br />Yes, everyone has their opinion.  I just feel that anyone who doesn't like this record must be expecting something that they have heard before, and from the bottom of my soul I feel that is the worst way to approach new music.  Just because Pearl Jam invented a distinct sound way back in the early 90's doesn't mean they have to cling to it.  They are showing their versatility and talent in performing different songs such as \\"You Are\\" and \\"Green Disease\\" with such effectiveness as well as courage.  I could have done without \\"Bushleaguer,\\" but hey, self expression is self expression.  The sound of the record is something else to consider, as the music sounds clearer and crisper than recent pearl jam albums.  Riot Act sounds like it has the clarity of Vs. with the good bottom end sound of Yield.  The production and mixing is quite well done, and going back and listening to Binaural makes that album sound like a muddy mess at times.  Kudos to Adam Kasper and Brendan O' brien for making a great sounding band sound even better.  <br />Coming from a music fan that loves equally Tool, Opeth, Peter Gabriel and Wes Montgomery, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  Anyone who doesn't recommend this did not give this album the chance it deserved.  There's something for EVERY Pearl Jam fan here.  $12-16 is a small price to pay for quality music like this.
071484232X|5.0|This is the best book on the works of John William Waterhouse to date. From Waterhouse's early works to his decline in popularity after World War 1 to his rediscovery, everything you wanted to know about his works and the man himself. Also his master works like Saint Cecilia, Hylas and the Nymphs and many others are presented in wonderful color to take your breath away. If that wasn't enough some addition works from Rossetti, Burn-Jones and Millais and other Victorian era artists are also featured here. This the ultimate book for lovers of Waterhouse's art works.
B00003CXI1|5.0|although the movie loses something on the small screen...it was wonderful to be able to watch certain scenes again and again.  Most notably the Chess scene which was brilliant.
B000007MVX|5.0|_A Passion Play_ is probably Jethro Tull's most dark, dense,  and unfathomable album. It followed the same lengthy one-track formula as the previous album _Thick As A Brick_. The concept on here seems to center around a man who was just deceased. He wonders whether he wants to go to heaven, hell or to be reborn--that's my take on it. While the combination of dense lyrics, wry humor and biblical imagery may hinder the &quot;full&quot; understanding of the concept, the complex musicianship found on this 45-minute work is top-notch. Ian Anderson and the boys seem to kick up their compositional/writing insights a notch more than they did on previous albums. On here, you'll find organic forms of jazz, classical and folk blended nicely with sophisticated rock. The technical prowess displayed by all the musicians on here is awe-inspiring and masterful. Ian Anderson takes on the flute, two kinds of saxaphones and acoustic guitars. He handles them all quite well.<br />_A Passion Play_ is a work that may require many listens before being appreciated to it's fullest. It's a work that features moments that can bring fright, melancholy and sinister laughs to many. It's a work that many people can come to appreciate after they've soaked up Jethro Tull's (or anyone else's) most accessible work, then realize it's true beauty, genius and transcendence.
B00006LPER|5.0|Isabelle Huppert is in one great movie after another. A couple of years ago she played the mysterious and apparently selfless wife of a famus composer in Claude Chabrol's Merci Pour Le Chocolat. This time she plays a piano teacher in yet another role filled with subtlety and mystery. The role is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier one as Huppert reveals clues to her characters troubled psyche with odd and disturbing actions which offer a sharp contrast to her calm and collected exterior. She does much of her acting with the same expression which makes her one of the most interesting performers to watch for what she conceals with each performance is what fascinates and keeps us attentive. The performance Huppert gives as the piano teacher is a disturbing one for beneath her reserved exterior and her very high reputation seethe the passions of an unhappy woman. Whether her mother has caused her daughter to grow into the person she has become or not is perhaps a matter for debate. It appears the mother is over protective but then as the story progresses one sees the mother has good reason to be over protective. Huppert's piano teacher loves her mother it seems but also wants to torture her mother. For her students the piano teacher wastes no time with feelings it seems but again the performance is subtle and layered and offers clues that perhaps she does care for them in her way. It is possible to interpret some of her actions in more than one way. Ultimately we find it is only she herself she wants to humiliate/torture as we see her act out in various circumstances-- most notably in her actions toward a young student who has an infatuation with her-- her own self-degradation. Frame to frame the story is exquisitely shot and told. The music is used to incredible effect. In one particularly fabulous scene the director allows the high plane of music of a previous scene to follow Huppert into the next scene where she enters another plane,one that is not high.
0399134204|5.0|Have you ever heard of a book called The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan. A book full of imagery, good choice of words that created pictures comes to life as if it was happen right in front of your own eyes. From the scale from one to ten, i would have to give it a nine because of the author careful of words. I love the way that Amy Tan created the picturso real &quot;the peak looked like giant fried fish head trying to jump out of a vat of oil&quot;. The book comprised with many different types like mystery, adventure, romance, and fiction. if you like these type of book then you would love to read The Joy Luck Club. <BR>     This book is about how a daughter trying to learn her mother's secret with the help of her mother's best friend. But the story also included of the other four members and their daughter whom also came to the u.s during the world war 2. Each women tells thier stories throught flashback ans their recall of the difficult time growning up. when you finish this book i garantee you would want to read it over again
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma is another much-maligned Pink Floyd foray into experimentation (see &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot;), and unjustly maligned, I say.  The live disc is great, and I challenge you to find a better version of Astronomy Domine or Careful with that Axe, Eugene (with the legendary Syd Barret armor-piercing shriek).  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun is better here than in its original state.  The live rendition of Saucerful of Secrets seems to have more direction than the original version.  On to Disc 2.  This seems to be a popular whipping boy for the Dark Side/Wall fans.  Some of it seems to be filler (see Sysyphus parts 2-3), but other parts seem to be flashes of brilliance.  I think the opening to Sysyphus is great (I call it &quot;Music to Build Pyramids By&quot;) and Grantchester Meadows is great for background music.  The Narrow Way is definitely a highlight.  Several Species of Small Furry Creatures Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict (which i think holds a record for longest song title) is odd, but I find the Scotsman part hilarious (&quot;Aend aye rdrdroolled daewn the maewntin...&quot;).  The Grand Vizier's Garden Party is a bit of an enigma to me, but I still give it a listen every now and then.  Overall, a great disc, and detractors be damned.
0743424425|3.0|i read this book when i was 12, thought it was the greatest thing ever. i just finished reading it again, im 32. its pretty poorly written in parts - a lot of parts. stanley kubricks film was excellent. i think this because he edited out all of the stupid, unbelievable things in the book, like the hedge animals coming to life. so ridiculous. he also added the scenes with the little ghost girls that was so much more affective than what was written in the book.
B000002U9W|5.0|I bought this at my college's campus store, and was surprised that they even carried it!  Atom Heart Mother Suite is one of the best songs they ever did, and I can't believe they haven't released a live version of it yet (and I know they've done it live: I've seen 'em).  I really enjoy the fact that they convinced an entire orchestra to experiment musically with different sounds, shrill noises, static starts and stops, and even a motorcycle (or is that a lawn mower?).  I'm surprised that no one has made a short film using it as the soundtrack (hey, if you're into Floyd soundtracks, check out 1969's &quot;More&quot; and 1972's &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; both of which are killer).  Anyhow, enough about the 24 minute masterpiece... &quot;If&quot; is an alright song by Waters: good to mellow out to.  &quot;Summer '68&quot; is probably the second best song on the album, penned by Richard Wright.  I hate pop, but this is actually pretty good.  &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is another good mellow-out tune, only this time it's by David Gilmour.  &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,&quot; which I think is one of the best titles ever, is probably the most underappreciated Pink Floyd song in history (after Corporal Clegg).  It's a great song, with the sound effects and all, and granted, it does take a few listens to get used to, but its detractors seem to hit the skip button too often.  All in all, probably the best pre-Dark Side album they made: its got folk, pop, rock (at the end of Fat Old Sun), psychedelic jam session, and a side-long epic.  Bravo, gentlemen.
B00005YXZH|5.0|It's not hard to figure out why this CD's average rating is one star lower than it should be.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot has received media scrutiny from all outlets, and particularly because of the label snafu and the Sam Means film.  When there's no pressure on a record to perform, a listener who's pleasantly surprised might get overzealous and give five stars.  However, there's a whole set of built-in expectations whenever a record receives top ratings in the New York Times, Rolling Stone Magazine, Alternative Press, CMJ, &amp;c.  People feel cheated if their initial experience with an album of this sort is anything short of orgasmic.<br />There are good reasons, however, to love this album.  Most obviously, the rest of Wilco's catalogue (which included some pretty good stuff) is entirely unlistenable after you hear this album.  The extra attention to texture, pitch, timbre, dynamics, rhythms, &amp;c., might lead to some slip-ups, but the overall sound of this album is far richer and more complex than anything the band, and probably the sub-genre, has ever produced.  And simply put, the songwriting and instrumentation are often beautiful.<br />Furthermore, the album traces several arcs.  Most apparent is the dynamic buildup and layering of songs, and effects from start to finish.  Equally important is the fact that the album is seen as one cohesive unit, rather than a diverse collection of singles.  Themes from the first track are picked up later on, and rhythms and songwriting devices are recycled.  Despite this, each track manages a unique freshness.<br />You may think this album's a little pretentious, or that Tweedy's voice isn't exactly a thing of beauty.  You'd be right on both counts.  But Wilco is so far ahead of the FM radio crowd, and so far ahead of the more &quot;indie scene&quot; that this album is a necessity, no matter what your musical tastes.
B000002C1W|4.0|Besides &quot;Ummagumma&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; this is probably the most disrespected album that Pink Floyd ever produced.  The critics hated it because Roger Waters left, and Floyd were trying to figure out how to continue without sounding empty (like they had to completely reinvent themselves after Syd Barret descended into hallucinations and living like a hermit).  Occasionally, this album sounds tragically 80's, but what can you do?  There are, however, really great songs on this album, such as Learning to Fly, Dogs of War (am I the only one who likes that song?), One Slip, On the Turning Away, and one of the top ten Floyd songs of all time, Sorrow.  That song alone is worth the price of the CD.  But that's just my opinion. Buy it yourself and see what you think.
1559409002|4.0|This is a fantastic film to watch sheerly for the way it was made. With a budget of $30,000 and made in Kansas, director Harvey manages to scare the viewer with little special effects. The location is beautiful, especially the abandoned amusement park (giving at least one good reason to visit Utah), and leaving the viewer wishing the filmmakers had made more than just one feature film. It is not the greatest movie by any means, but it resembles Hitchcock's Psycho in its small size and independence from typical Hollywood. <BR>The extras on this Criterion Collection gives greater insight to how a movie can be made and that anyone can really do it. In 1962, remember, there was no Sundance or Cannes and independent films were rarely done and even more rarely acknowledged. This one has built a following over the years for good reason; anyone interested in filmmaking and technique should watch this film.
B00006AW2P|5.0|The Rolling Stones way back when started off as a R&amp;B, Blues band that interpreted the songs of their idols. On this album, we get to see the influences first hand, and I can only wish that they still made songs like this. There are some good songs here that only casual Stones fans wont know, but they are missing some great music. I think that the listener should give these following songs a real listen to: NOT FADE AWAY, ROUTE 66, I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU, HONEST I DO, CAN I GET A WITNESS, LITTLE BY LITTLE, I'M A KING BEE. These songs are great and fun to listen to. With the bonus of being remastered, I think compared to the earlier CD, you can hear a difference. I highly recommend this CD for every STONES fan, and this isnt a bad place for some casual fans to start.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I've been a comics fan for most of my life, so when I heard that there was going to be a Spider-Man movie, I was happy. But I remembered how dreadful the past 2 Batman films had been, and hoped against hope that Spider-Man would be better.<BR>Was it ever.<BR>Before I go further, I'll go over the plot. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is your average high school dork. On a field trip to Columbia University's science lab, he gets bit by a genetically engineered spider. The bite gives Peter exceptional agility, stamina, and strength, as well as the unique ability to spin webs from his wrists. Originally using his powers for self-gain, he decides to change his ways when his Uncle Ben is killed by a gunman in a carjacking that he could have prevented. Living by Uncle Ben's motto, \\"With great power comes great responsibility,\\" Peter becomes Spider-Man. His powers come to the ultimate test when New York is terrorized by the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).<BR>The acting was solid on all counts. Maguire was good both as the nerdy Peter Parker and the wisecracking Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst, who plays love interest and high school student Mary Jane Watson, wasn't spectacular but had great chemistry with Maguire. Dafoe was over-the-top at times as Green Goblin, but there was one scene in particular involving a mirror that was maybe the finest scene in the movie. Supporting actor J.K. Simmons stoke the show as J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of a newspaper trying to make Spider-Man come out looking like a criminal.<BR>This DVD is loaded with tons of special features and easter eggs (special features not listed on the menu that you have to 'hunt' for). Included is a gallery of Spider-Man artists, the HBO Special \\"Making of Spider-Man,\\" and various character files. One of my favorite easter eggs was a CGI gag reel. Good luck finding it, though.<BR>Overall, director Sam Raimi has created a comic book movie that's not just for comics fans. Smart, witty, dramatic...Spider-Man has it all, and special feautures that you'll actually watch. I can't recommend it enough.
B00006BXI0|5.0|If you like your music, heavy, progressive, and most importanly original, this is the album. People who just like music as backgound noise need not apply. They won't like it one bit. If you are a musician in any genre, there will be a thing or two you can pick up on here.
0345404475|4.0|\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Philip K. Dick is a science-fictionary novel which deals with the issue of genuine and artificial life. In it, protagonist Rick Deckhard, a bounty-hunter with the duty of \\"retiring\\" escaped androids, runs into uncertainty about his true origin himself.<BR>The mainstream religion by 1992 is the so-called Mercerism, its leader being the Christ-like Wilbur Mercer.By holding on to \\"empathy boxes\\", Mercer's followers go into fusion with him and everyone else connected to the boxes. Empathy is an important human trait throughout the novel, since it cannot be felt by the humanoid robots. By trying to uncover Mercerism as a swindle, the androids even try to disprove the concept of empathy itself - as something the humans have made up in order to inhabit a virtue the androids are not able to experience...<br />I believe that this is a pretty good book, so I advise you to read it if you have time. And if you have some idea of how they produce these androids you might want to contact me (jtesch@gmx.de), I am interested in it but I couldn't find out.
0684803356|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is a fantastic book.  Hemingway writes heroes with fears, doubts, and faults so well that I feel a deep connection with them.  Not every man is a John Wayne; passing through life clear of purpose and without second thoughts.  (But watch a little tv and you'd think it were so.)  Hemingway creates characters I can understand, appreciate, and connect with.  Also, Robert Jordan's love interest reflected my own with my fiancee.  The book was fantastic for its story, its plot, the characters and the way it made me feel reading it and afterwards.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Agaetis Byrjun has changed my life. I honestly feel sorry for those who have not yet experienced the music of Sigur Ros. Since I first discovered Sigur Ros a year ago, I have passed this album on to everyone I've felt is worthy of its deep beauty. But now is the time for you to get this album and experience it for yourself. I honestly believe that if everyone in this world sat back and listened to Sigur Ros together, there would be peace. Within Sigur Ros lies the universal language.
0688062334|5.0|I first read Howl when I was thirteen, and it left such an impression on me that I am still reading it at twenty.  The story of a girl who is turned into an old woman and who has to endure many strange ordeals - like green slime and weed-killer! - while seeking her fortune, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" turns the fairy-tale world wonderfully upside down.  Sophie is a completely human protagonist, and Howl is an impossible but endearing male lead (like Chrestomanci but rather more prone to hysteria).  All the supporting characters, from Calcifer to Fanny, are drawn with such individuality that one almost feels books should be written about them as well!  <br />The book is funny, complex, fast-paced, and filled with some of the most memorable characters of children's literature.  More subtle and sophisticated than Harry Potter, it treats themes such as death and lonliness realistically while remaining unforced and relentlessly cheerful.  An added bonus is the clever use of John Donne's \\"Song\\" as a central plot device.

B000002GK1|5.0|Quite possibly one of the greatest rock albums of all time, not only hard hitting but great to sing along too...that is if you could ever come close to the wailing god that chris cornell is. If you dont care much for singing, but guitar is your thing, then you will be shot back in your chair after hearing this one.
7119005901|4.0|The story gets Five stars But the quality of the books gets a Three or Four. The pages are really thin and there are a lot words that are spelled incorrectly. Thankfully, the words are fairly easy to figure out, but having to solve the occasional word puzzle in the middle of the story can be quite annoying. This is still one of the greatest stories ever written and an excellent buy.

0345404475|2.0|The novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" by Philip K. Dick is the futuristic story of Rick Deckard. Rick is a bounty hunter who is assigned to \\"retire\\" humanoid robots, who live unnoticed in the San Francisco of 1992. Throughout the course of the book, Deckard finds himself caught between his own feelings and the requirements of his job to kill.<BR>The book is very complex and fairly difficult to understand, whick makes one read a passage again, in order to see through it. Philip K. Dick made up some technical terms, because the action plays in the future. Those terms though, sometimes make the action look ridiculous, since we know today what 1992 really looked like. <BR>The story did not attract me much and I was quite bored reading the novel. Still, there are some interesting aspects about it, such as Dick's definition of what human life is all about, which gives the story somewhat of a profound stroke.<BR>I can recommend this book to those of you who are into science fiction and feel like reading about a dark and disturbing vision of the future.
B00006LIRI|3.0|How can any U2 90's compilation leave out:<br />- The Fly<br />- Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses<br />- Lemon<br />- Elevation<br />- Walk On<br />- and perhaps... Please<br />Leaving 6 singles off of an album that is a 'greatest hits' just doesn't make much sense! Perhaps Disc One should've been a 'greatest hits' while Disc Two (instead of silly remixes) could have been the band's personal favorites that weren't singles. This would've made for a more cohesive collection...
0800141849|4.0|I've never watched any other Barbra Streisand movies, and I don't listen to much of her music, but this movie struck a chord in me--I LOVE IT!<br />Lauren Bacall and Mimi Rogers really make the movie.  They play Rose's (Barbra) extremely vain mother and sister, and they are truly funny.  The movie is full of humor--not exactly high-brow, but well above the usual un-intelligent jokes in so many movies these days.  The more I watch it, the more funny moments I catch!<br />There is some dialogue that gets a tad bit too deep for this movie, but it's limited enough that you may not even notice.  Don't look to this movie for nuggets of infinite wisdom, but for a cozy night with popcorn and a blanket, it's a winner.<br />It's not for you if you don't like chick flicks.  But if you have an affinity for corny, cute movies, this one might be for you!  And finally, it hardly hurts to have Pierce Brosnan in the movie!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is unusual. It keeps you guessing, but not because the story changes or because you do not (really) know what is going to happen next. It is because you have become like the main character of the story -- your memory is not what you are accustomed to. You realize you know much more than you think, but cannot piece it together. The movie does not play tricks with the camera, as some do to a nauseating degree, rather it plays tricks with time (and, hence, your mind). These are the better kinds of movies. Only ten minutes or so are a little slow (you can see some repetition only so much). Definitely one of those that you want to see -- not as a hot-item summer movie, but as one that you have to see in order to say you have experienced all types of movies. Try it.
0312117337|5.0|Do you want to have your own personal Zen Master, Guru, or Old Wise Yogi to help you along your Spiritual Growth and in life in general?  Sure you do, but you ask yourself.   \\"Where am I going to find a Wise Master in the Heartlands of America, the Deep South, or in the Rural New England?\\"  You can find this Wise Guru deep within, as we all have Wise Spirit Guides, and with the use of these beautiful cards, you can finally harness their voice.  <br />The Osho Zen Tarot card, is not like your traditional Tarot, but something more.  Each card has a beautiful image with one single word, and when the cards are lade out in front of you, many of your questions can be answered.  These cards are beautiful and good to use during your personal meditation time.  I use the Osho Zen Tarot  as a great tool for meditation, you know sometimes the mind wonders when we meditate, and this is an excellent way to control the mind.  Ask a question as you begin to meditate and pull out one card and meditate on that certain card.  <br />The Osho Zen tarot is good for your own Spiritual Work, or for giving readings to those who are also on a Spiritual Road.  But do not confuse this deck with your average Fortune Telling Tool, or Tarot Deck, as this deck will confuse those who seek answers to love, money and material gain.   The Osho Zen Tarot is a tool for inner and Spiritual Growth.   The Osho Zen tarot is excellent when working with your Spirit Guides, Ancestors or Angel Guides.   Place these on your Ancestral Shrine, and when ever you want an answer from your Spirit Guides or Ancestors lay the cards out, and get ready for a bit of enlightment.
0738203335|3.0|My father asked specifically for this title.  He reports that it's very interesting.
0449227421|2.0|On a recent trip to Florida I stopped in at the airport book shop and purchased a book for the return flight to Italy. I had read Ken Follet's excellent &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; a few years ago and decided to try another of his books. This book did not even approach the level of the first Follet novel I read. Unlike &quot;Pillars&quot;, in &quot;The Third Twin&quot; Follet does not appear to have done any research on his subject matter. In one section he has a character reminiscing about his father who was a SECOND LIEUTENANT in the US NAVY. The US Navy has never had second lieutenants; junior officers of that pay grade are called Ensigns. But this is only the beginning of technical errors that destroy an otherwise compelling story line. One of the main weapons of the protagonist is a computer program that she wrote to compare elements in database to develop genetic comparisons. Unfortunately, the way the thing is supposed to work is closer to something that Gandalf or Harry Potter would whip up rather than something out of computer science class. The poorly researched and unbelievable stuff goes on and worsens throughout the book. More examples - people out on bail without a security clearance wandering the halls of the Pentagon and putting magic floppy disks into the Pentagon computers - you guessed it - so they could search the databases on those computers. All in all, I was very, very glad when the book drew to its predictable close. <br />Follet is a good writer, but he really needs to research his subjects better before writing a book.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's about time I reviewed this. It's been one of my favorite albums since the day it was released, and was the first cd that I really anticipated the release of. No cd have I listened to more intensely during the weeks just after it's purchase than this one. It's almost beyond reviewing. It's hard to really say why it's so good, beyond just to say it rules. Hopefully, I can elaborate on precisely why it rules.<br />People like to criticize Tool for not being true Virtuoso musicians.(Conversely people criticize Dream Theater for focusing too much on their technical skills. Both groups are morons.) I don't see how anyone can have a problem with the rhythm section. Carey is a great drummer, easily the most distinctive I have heard, particularly on this album. No one plays patterns like him, and he can still lay down the hyper-speed barrage of thrash and death when he wants to.(listen to Ticks&Leeches) Chancellor is one of the best metal bassists out there, primarily because he is simply a much more significant piece of the band than most are.  His hypnotic, flowing bass-lines provide the starting point for the albums winding structures, rather than him simply adding power to the guitar parts.(though he still does that a lot) He and Adam Jones have easily the best interplay of any bassist and guitarist I have ever heard.(Come to think of it, Carey and Chancellor have the best interplay of any rhythm section I've ever heard.) People try and tell me Adam Jones is a bad guitar player, and I don't really buy it. I don't play the guitar, and while his stuff doesn't sound that hard, I frankly have no real idea, and I doubt most of the reviewers who criticize him really know what the hell they are talking about. He's no John Petrucci or Dave Mustaine, but so what. He's doesn't try to be like them. He's about mood and texture and is frankly much more creative than either of those guitarists I mentioned.  Maynard holds it all together. He's long been my favorite vocalist, and I don't forsee my opinion changing any time soon.  He can snarl with real rage and drone robotically too, and everything in between. Once again, he doesn't have a stunning range or technique, but has an other world intensity to him which is simply unmatched. He's probably not as good here as he is on there previous 2 albums, but he still crushes most anyone else.<br />Some people have tried to complain that this album doesn't have much music, that it \\"only has 3-4 real songs\\". These people need to learn to count. This album has 6 (somewhat) conventional songs, and one ultra-long composition that isn't really properly described as a song, but is made up entirely of \\"actual music\\". All in all, this album has over 70 minutes of \\"actual music\\" which is a whole lot more than most cds you'll buy. There isn't a bad song on this album. The Grudge is the opener. It's a solid rocker, with some intense drum work and a great flow to the song as a whole, with the basic riff slowly mutating throughout it. The guitars are great, with gentle and hypnotic portions giving way to some truly intense pounding. Maynard's vocals really shine here too. He uses a monotonous drone as the bass style, which gives way to the envenomed shouting and a slower, gentler style as well. The next two tracks Eon Von Blue Apocalypse/The Patient make up the next full song. Eon Von... is just an intro with gentle, eastern guitars, which continue into the beginning of The Patient, which builds to the lumbering metal assault that characterizes the second half of the song, which also includes some nice multi-part vocals. Schism is the next song, and the first single to the album. It is arguably the weakest songs, but is still very cool. It's sort of a toned down The Grudge, with a similar vocal style to it, and a similar basic structure, with main riff slowly being built upon and then dismantled again. Parabol/Parabola is another single, though they sadly cut leave off Parabol, even though it is clearly part of the same song. Parabol and Parabola are the soft/loud, gentle/violent counterparts to each other, with the Parabola part being one of the heavier, more unrelentinly intense parts of this album, particularly the slow, brooding instrumental section that closes the song. Tick&Leeches is very cool. It's a return to the more hostile, enraged Tool of yore. This is one of the heavier songs they've done. Carey's drums simply astound, and Maynard gives one of his most vitriolic vocal performances to date. The quiet bridge in the middle is even pretty cool, though I feel it should be a little shorter. Lateralus is probably the single best song on the album. It was also a single, though the radio jerks usually cut out the middle 2 1/2 minutes, which really hurts it. The introduction is just beautiful, and it creates a good sense anticipation for the song itself. It's got more inhuman drumming, particularly during the verses, and a good mix of power-chord pounding and more atmospheric squealing from Jones. The middle section is the key to the song, with more stunning vocal work. The epic composition of Disposition/Reflection/Triad follows, which is easily the most ambitious thing Tool has ever done to this point in their career. Reflection, at 11 minutes is the centerpiece of the composition, and is a stunning piece at that. It's flowing and softer than most Tool work, with a rather psychadelic feel to much of it. I would try to describe it further, but to do so is essentially pointless. Just listen to it yourself. Triad is an extremely unusual, and therefore very appropriate closing section. It's an instrumental section, with an odd, half industrial, half tribal beat to it, an excellent use of some very strange sound effects and some of Jones best near avant-garde guitar squealing combined with some pounding and stunningly thick sounding rhythm work. Faaip de Oiad is the other not really music track. Still, the drum work in it is very cool.<br />Tool rules. Buy Tool now.f the same song.

B00006CXXU|5.0|this CD just ROCKS! I'm interested in this little girl since her debut, she really has an amazing voice, but her songs were really soo teen-pop classics and her debut album is (made her a grammy-winner) a very well example of what a teen pop debut album should be... but on this one, oh my GOD! I'm pretty sure that this is the best CD I've listened so far, like about 3 or 4 years. She improved herself as the lyrics, melodies, vocal techniques, and now she really has her own style! She's not &quot;one of those Britney-ish teen-popper&quot;s anymore. If this girl follows this way she'll surely be the next queen of soul!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Wow. This album is great. I haven't listened to much Radiohead, but this is really amazingly good. These are the tracks:<BR>1 - Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box - Great opener. Sort of a danceable tune. Quiet beats and percussion that sounds like the drummer or someone is banging on pipes or a kitchen pot. It's really innovative and cool.<BR>2 - Pyramid song - Hoo-boy. This is a harrowing, piano-driven ballad that is really inaccessible, but it is still marvelous and haunting. Thom's vocals are sublime.<BR>3 - Pulk/pull revolving doors - Pure fuzzed-out techno. It enters with a bang. The track could easily be on an Autechre record. The spoken vocal is so heavily treated - with distortion, reverb, and god knows what else - that it's really difficult to understand what he's saying, although it seems like Thom's reciting a laundry list of different types of doors. Sort of dumb, but has the feel of the Alien spaceship.<BR>4 - You and whose army? - Smiply divine. The track starts with a Country/Western feel (don't worry, that's really good in this case), but as the track progresses, Thom's vocals proceed to become more shrouded in reverb, and the piano and drums make an entrance for the ages. It ends sounding like late-period Beatles, and while I might have just committed blasphemy, I don't really care. Worth the price alone.<BR>5 - I might be wrong - Indispensible. The twangy, distorted lead guitar is awesome, with drums that are quiet, yet riotously funky. The muted strumming and funky bass are sweet. Sounds like Thom Yorke in charge of a funk band. I like it when the tune suddenly deconstructs with a minute to go.<BR>6 - Knives out - This is beautiful, classic Radiohead - the Radiohead I was expecting to hear when I got the disc. You can understand Thom's vocals. The lyrics are great. Such a relief after the first five tracks, although it's nothing of the sort on it's own. Splendid.<BR>7 - Morning bell/Amnesiac - There had to be at least one misfire, and this is it. It is an utter death march. I loathe this track. Avoid it at all costs.<BR>8 - Dollars and cents - Easily the best drumming on the allbum, and possibly of the year. Phil is great. The only misstep is the lyrics, which are a little too preachy. Basically an anticapitalist rant about how dehumanized captilism is, with \\"we will crack your little souls\\" ending it.<BR>9 - Hunting bears - This is a doodly little instrumental consisting of guitar and a keyboard. Not much here, but better than the death march commonly known as \\"Morning bell/Amnesiac\\"...isn't there another version of this on Kid A? Is it any better?<BR>10 - Like spinning plates - This is the notorious \\"backwards\\" song. Yes, it was recorded backwards, with the backing track of an unreleased song, titled \\"I Will\\", played backwards. It does sound like spinning plates. Thom sang the vocals backwards, and then they played the tape of his voice forwards. It's really good.<BR>11 - Life in a glasshouse - I heard this described as Thom Yorke fronting Charlie Parker's band. That is not at all accurate. It sounds like Thom Yorke fronting Louis Armstrong's band. The sheer power of Humphrey Lyttelton's trumpet - still intact at 80 years old - is amazing. Thom's utter despair is great. I've run out of good adjectives, can't you tell?<br />I really love this album, but I wish they hadn't even tried that remix of \\"Morning bell/Amnesiac\\" because it really does [stink]. A lot. However, other than that, the album is incredibly good, and shows that at least one band is still making good music (although Blur's 13 was incredible, too). Buy it!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I don't normally review &quot;Best of&quot;s and live albums - too much of a &quot;been-there-done-that&quot; thing going on - but, like the Tom Petty anthology of a few years ago, there's a completeness and comprehensiveness to THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC that can't be ignored (the fact that Fleetwood Mac is my favorite band of all time probably has something to do with it as well!). The disc could very easily be subtitled &quot;The Singles&quot;, as it includes almost every song released by the band as a single between 1975 and 1992. But that's only part of the set's charm....there is still a vitality and energy to this music that's enchanting, even now. I dare anyone to listen to these songs and not have one or two jump out at them, reminding them of some one, some time, some place or some thing. Highlights for me include &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, the opening track on Disc One, with it's energetic Buckingham vocal and in-your-face guitar, and &quot;Dreams&quot;, the band's only (believe it or not!) #1 song. With it's bass line pounding like a heartbeat and Nicks cooing her poetry-like verses, this song is as powerful as it was twenty-five years ago! Then there's &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, a song that's appeared on practically every &quot;Best Of&quot; list over the last decade. This is angry rock &amp; roll, both literally and figuratively, and it's biting attack jumps out of the speakers at you still. Then there's &quot;Silver Springs.&quot; I'm so glad this track has finally gotten it's just dues in the last five years; with it's tinkling keyboards, soaring backing vocals and emotion-drenched performance by Nicks, this is a true classic that deserved better than the long-out-of-print, non-album B-side fate it had suffered for twenty years. &quot;Love In Store&quot; is a melodic rocker that presents Fleetwood Mac at it's best....tight playing, a creamy lead vocal by Christine McVie and that unparallelled harmony vocalizing from Buckingham and Nicks. Why this wasn't a bigger hit upon it's release in '82 still amazes me! &quot;Tusk&quot; is still as fun as ever, while the beauty and simplicity of &quot;Songbird&quot; never grows old. Closing out the disc is &quot;Storms&quot;, an album track of Nicks' that still gives me chills. &quot;Haunting&quot; is the only way to describe this beautifully-sung, brilliantly-arranged masterpiece. Disc Two, though, has to be my favorite. You've got &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, with it's slightly naughty (for 1977!) overtones, and &quot;Little Lies&quot;, probably one of the two or three best singles ever recorded by the band. Then there's &quot;Think About Me&quot;, a churning rocker that was sadly overlooked in 1980. I still find &quot;Hold Me&quot; as magical as I did in 1982, while &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; is still the &quot;classic-waiting-to-happen&quot; that I thought it was in '87. &quot;World Turning&quot; still has that &quot;in-your-face&quot;/jamming-in-the-studio vibe to it, probably the main song off of FLEETWOOD MAC that hinted at all the good things yet to come, while &quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot; is the &quot;Little single that never got a chance.&quot; Released as the last single off of TUSK, it quickly disappeared. Don't let that fool you....with it's sinister guitar and forboding lyrics about clawing fans and wasting away to the point of being unrecognizable, this song is as eerie and mesmerizing as it was in 1979. &quot;Family Man&quot; is goofy fun, while &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot; still floats like a butterfly and stings like.....a stolen kiss. I'm also glad to see they chose &quot;Skies The Limit&quot; to represent BEHIND THE MASK versus the much weaker &quot;Save Me.&quot; Wrapping it all up is the springboard beat of &quot;Paper Doll&quot;, another strong song from Nicks that deserved a better fate than the one it encountered in 1992. Soooo.....as much as I love this set, is there anything I would have done differently? Oh, yeah! Besides cutting back on one or two of the album tracks from RUMOURS, I would have used this chance to finally release &quot;Ricky&quot; on an album. This non-album B-side from the &quot;Little Lies&quot; single is amazing, unlike any other vocal by Christine McVie we've ever seen. I would have also swapped out one of Buckingham's tracks from RUMOURS with &quot;Oh Diane&quot; from MIRAGE, as well as included the studio version of &quot;Big Love.&quot; As for Miss Nicks, I would gladly have traded &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; - the weakest song she's EVER recorded!- with &quot;Angel&quot; from TUSK, &quot;That's Alright&quot; from MIRAGE or &quot;Love Is Dangerous&quot; from BEHIND THE MASK. Which brings us to my only other bone of contention - there is no mention whatsoever of Billy Burnette or Rick Vito anywhere in the liner notes, even though they played on four of the songs (Vito's writing credit is even removed from &quot;Paper Doll!&quot;). I know this set was meant to showcase &quot;The Big Five&quot;, but it's just not fair to act as it these two weren't part of the band during this period. Vito and Burnette deserved better. That said, pick up THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC and get reacquainted with some old friends. I guarantee that you will be transported back to - to quote Stevie Nicks on &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; - &quot;a certain time,...a certain place!&quot;ack on one or two of the album tracks from RUMOURS, I would have used this chance to finally release &quot;Ricky&quot; on an album.

B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall has been hailed my many as one of the great jazz musicians of the modern era. After hearing her last album, the wildly successful The Look of Love, I couldn't understand why. Sure, it was recorded well, but to these ears, it was little more than a cure for insomnia. It seemed like her management was more interested with marketing her based on her looks, rather than her musical abilities. But now, on her newest release, Live in Paris, I can hear what all the fuss has been about. <br />Accompanied by her core band--Anthony Wilson on guitar, John Clayton on bass, and Jeff Hamilton on drums--Krall wows the crowd time and time again. Then again, it's hard to go wrong when most of the material is coming from the Great American Songbooks of Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, George and Ira Gershwin. <br />Recorded live over four nights at the historic Olympia Theatre, Live in Paris gives you a firsthand account of the ambience and excitement of a musical evening with her. The only thing missing is the stage banter you'd hear at a `real' show. Krall is actually very talkative during her shows and (as anyone who's had the pleasure of seeing here perform will tell you) the fact that the interaction with her audience is missing is a disappointment. <br />The majority of the songs are performed by her core band. They're joined by the Orchestre Symphonique Europeen on \\"Let's Fall in Love\\" and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\" In addition, percussionist Paulinho Da Costa joins them on 4 tracks, and John Pisano contributes acoustic guitar on 3 tracks. However, make no mistakes. As great as her accompanying musicians may be, this is Krall's show. Swinging like there's no tomorrow, tracks like \\"I Love Being Here With You,\\" \\"'Deed I Do\\" and \\"Devil May Care\\" are the disc's biggest highlights. <br />She doesn't slack off on the ballads either, though. Her distinctive phrasing and cool, sultry vocals turn the songs into true works of art. Her stunning cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"A Case ofYou\\" is a perfect example. The only drawback, if you can call it one, is the extra studio track here--a cover of the wedding reception staple, Billy Joel's \\"Just the Way You Are.\\" It's not that it's bad (it's a straight rendition of the song); it's more a case of just being unnecessary. <br />All told, Live in Paris is an excellent place to start for those who may not be familiar with the Grammy Award-winning musician, and longtime fans are sure to enjoy it as well. The only bad thing about this CD is that it's too short.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I don't even own a dvd player but i'd buy one if seinfeld was released on dvd. Looking at some of the other reviews it is clear that seinfeld is loved the world over so why wouldn't someone cash in and make it.<br />I heard that the show was syndicated so much all over the world ,and that they need the approval of everyone it was syndicated to if they want release a dvd, that it would be a logistical nightmare to organise. but surely it would be worth the effort for the money it would make. If they want someone to sit and call each tv company involved across the glode i'd gladly do it and pay the phone bill too if it meant i could have every glorious episode of seinfeld on dvd.
B000002IWH|5.0|Naming my favorite soundtrack wasn't a very hard choice, but it's a very close call between this one &amp; Singles (mainly cuz the musical vibe was more consistent in The Crow), which are both equally good movies.  I don't even own very many soundtracks, mainly cuz there's usually only a few good songs, or I already have the songs I like on the artist's albums. This one is a rare exception that someone else pointed out that actually GOES WITH the film, not just a cash-in with mediocre songs.  Another problem with soundtracks is the variety is usually too diverse, which is why people only like a song here &amp; there.  This one does have a diversity of songs by different types of rock, but they're not all that mainstream (STP prolly the only exception).  Most people who don't go for mainstream as easily are usually more appreciative of other types of styles &amp; actually enjoy exploring other bands they're never heard of.  These diverse songs somehow go together to paint a dark picture for the whole film.<br /><br />The Cure's &quot;Burn&quot; is a great start for the album.  The thing that bugs me is that people who ordinarily don't like The Cure really like this song...&amp; what a shame too, cuz they're missing out  (they're my favorite band)!!  If you haven't heard Disintegration, shame on you!!  It has a similar driving bass vibe that &quot;Fascination Street&quot; has.  MLG's &quot;Golgotha Tenement Blues&quot; is a WAY cool creepy song, I can't believe some people don't even like it!!  Also check out another cool song of theirs, &quot;Butterfly Wings&quot;.  &quot;Big Empty&quot; is definitely my all-time favorite STP song, mainly thanks to the drastic dynamics from the mellow verse to the intense chorus, &amp; an interesting bass line.<br />NIN's &quot;Dead Souls&quot; was THE reason I got this, but I didn't know it was a cover until a couple of years after I got it.  *I* think NIN did it justice though... &amp; yes, I love Joy Division (&amp; New Order) too, so don't condemn me for not knowing about it before :P  RATM's &quot;Darkness&quot; will satisfy any Rage fan (like myself) with it's funky vibe, but the title alone gives it a place here.  The Femmes &quot;Color Me Once&quot; is definitely one of the highlights on here... so much infact that one VERY late night I came home &amp; listened to it prolly 10+ times in a row... which made it skip REALLY bad after that &amp; I had to get another copy :-D  Don't ask how it affected me, it just kinda crept up on me, &amp; now it's prolly my 2nd favorite song on here.<br />I usually have to be in the mood for tracks 7-9, but they're cool songs too.  FLNL's &quot;Slip Slide&quot; is an exceptional track for one of the least known of bands on here.  TKK's &quot;After the Flesh&quot; &amp; Mary Chain's &quot;Snakedriver&quot; are good ones from them, &amp; will satisfy old fans as well as others who've never heard of these good &quot;late '80's&quot; bands. Medicine's &quot;Time Baby&quot; kinda signals the end with its more mellow vibe, but is a good song, &amp; both this band &amp; TKK are featured in the movie.  I definitely have my favorites on here that I wanted to hear more than once, so I rarely got through it all the way &amp; heard the slow last track &quot;It Can't Rain All the Time&quot; the least.<br />This definitely has something for every true rock fan... alternative, metal, goth, industrial, whatever you wanna call it.  It's a consistently dark soundtrack for a dark movie, &amp; even better when listened to at night.  This soundtrack &amp; the movie also far surpass the sequels.  If you like any of these bands or any of the songs from the movie, GET THIS NOW!!, so don't condemn me for not knowing about it before :P  RATM's &quot;Darkness&quot; will satisfy any Rage fan (like myself) with it's funky vibe, but the title alone gives it a place here.

B000007T1M|4.0|A lot of people who know about System will show off how 'old school' they are and brag about \\"how Toxicity just ...compared to the first album.\\"  Many of these folks are hard-pressed to give you a specific reason behind this statement, however.  What exactly, if anything, makes their first album better?  What are the differences/similarities between the two?  Which one is the better buy?  Where are we going and why am I in this handbasket?  I'll try and help you solve these and other questions, if only you continue reading the most helpful review I could produce for you kids. <br />The reasons that I, personally, prefer System's self-titled album to Toxicity are numerous and simple.  Here's a quick break-down.<br />1.)  The first album is heavier, more aggressive, more 'metal'. <BR>2.)  The first album is more creative and fresh than Toxicity.<BR>3.)  The first album seems to represent the band better as a whole.<BR>4.)  The songwriting on self-titled seems more experimental, over-the-top.  The same is often argued in favor of Toxicity instead; I disagree.<BR>5.)  Serj's vocals and lyrics are funnier, more political on self-titled.<BR>6.)  If hear some Linkin Park fan talk about how great \\"Chop Suey!\\" is one more time, I'm going to pass a stone...why is this STILL happening?<br />In short, I think that System's is much more intense, heavy, and brilliant than Toxicity, which, while still an excellent release, is rather drab and toned-down when compared to the original material.  All kinds of critics and writers are hailing Toxicity as one of the greatest metal albums ever...give me a break.  While not all of the songs on this album are truly outstanding, they all have their great moments, whether it be some riff or drum timing change, or some crazy vocal peice or whatever, and I think it's safe to say that the songs are more memorable than the second album.  Let's take a look at some of the more stand-out songs on their own merit, and cut with the comparissons for amoment.<br />Song 2, \\"Know\\".  A social commentative song from Serj, which is the kind of song he writes best, I think.  Great drum section from John, too, really kicks up the album's energy up a notch.  Lots of screaming with aggressive bass and guitar riffs to match.  <br />Song 3, \\"Sugar\\".  Chances are, if you've heard any song on this album before, it's this one or \\"Spiders\\".  Admittedly, they're the singles that turned me onto the band in the first place, and I still love both songs.  This one is basically just a fun, fast-paced tune to get your blood pumping and your body movin'.  Addictive vocal hook that will have you singing along instantly, even if you can't figure out what the hell he's saying.<br />Song 4, \\"Suggestions\\".  If you combined Primus, Jane's Addiction, and Metallica, you might get a song like this.  Shavo's rhythmic, pounding bassline compliments the schizophrenic guitar part, perfectly.  Contains an undeniable 'laugh out loud' moment at the beginning of the third verse.  Genius.  The predecessor to that \\"Chop Suey!\\" #1 single thing...<br />Song 5, \\"Spiders\\".  Total change of pace for the album, even the band itself, but it works.  Very dark, moody, haunting...great lyrics with an absolutely chilling guitar riff will have you putting this one on repeat for awhile.  Most emotional, serious song on the album, without a doubt.  One of the scariest basslines ever, I think it's safe to say.<br />Song 6, \\"DDevil\\".  It'd just like to point out the fabulous drum/bass breakdown 12 seconds into the song.  That is all.<br />Song 8, \\"War?\\".  Brilliance!  This is my absolute favorite System song, to this day.  \\"War?\\" is a perfect example of what system is all about, I think...part thrash, part alt-metal, even a trace of hardcore punk thrown in, with great political flavor and a quirky sound overall.  This song defines System of a Down.  You'll have the chorus (\\"Of war, we don't speak any more of war...\\") stuck in your head in no time.  WE WILL FIGHT THE HEATHANS!<br />Song 13, \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\"  Probably the most blatant political song on the album, but doesn't take itself too seriously (or lightly, for that matter).  Great way to close off one of the most outstanding metal albums of the era.<br />In conclusion, I strongly recommend this album to anyone who hasn't heard it before, or who simply hasn't had a chance to pick it up yet.  If you're worried that it's a little TOO different from Toxicity, don't worry, it isn't like they totally remodled their sound or whathaveyou...but I think that the musicianship and songwriting on this one is far superior anything they've done since, so check it out.  Amazon's got a great price on it, too...as I write this, it's just over [$].  Can't beat that.  I've heard this band described as 'Rage Against the Machine meets TooL' more than once, and even though those two just happen to be my favorite bands of all time, I disagree.  They have some elements from either band, but they're more original than that.  With this album, System invented a sound and feel purely their own, and I hope they're able to stick with it, as well as with each other, for a long time coming.<br />Ditch that \\"Aeriels\\" junk and pick up this one, baby.  You'll be glad you did.
0375414053|1.0|It's difficult to not give anything away about the book in order to back up the criticisms in the review title, but the character read as someone that couldn't possibly exist in the real world. A collection of stereotypes: the high-powered career-woman and the stay-at-home-mom, smashed impossibly together.
B00004XONN|5.0|Most definitely the best Radiohead album. I had bought a couple of other Radiohead CDs like OK Computer and Amnesiac before I bought this one and i never really appreciated them. Once I heard this one, you can say I tuned in to the Radiohead wavelength. They are a fantastic band and if you're just starting out on them, get this one.<br />The reason why I think this album's so good is the way it has interwoven various styles and sounds producing a not so coherent sound, but with a haunting melodious overtone. Songs like &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;How to disappear completely&quot; are masterpieces. Radiohead have wonderfully blended discordant tones and lyrics into music that at once begs introspection and amazement. Somehow I felt Amnesiac was more distant in its call.
B000001FP8|4.0|The guys took 4 years in the making of this album, but the result is very high:<BR>once again the partnership with Desmond Child pays off...especially on such tracks as BAD MEDICINE, BLOOD ON BLOOD and the energy-filled YOU WERE BORN TO BE MY BABY.<BR>I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU is the classic rock ballad that is an apology from a man in love who knows he made mistakes. <BR>Useless to point out the best track of the whole CD is something in which Diane Warren teams up with the rest of the band.<BR>WILD IS THE WIND could have easily been a # 1 hit...yet no single release was scheduled, so it remains one of those hidden nuggets you need to buy the album to be aware of.<BR>The whole CD is filled with a cowboy-style plot, although it does not even remotely border to country music, but just take a listen to STICK TO YOUR GUNS or RIDE, COWBOY RIDE and won't take long to understand these guys grew up on western myths...<BR>Possibly one of their best.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I'll start off by saying I'm a religiously devout Bond fanatic. I did however find International Man Of Mystery and The Spy Who Shagged Me hilarious, and was consequently surprised how bad Goldmember turned out to be. <br />Indeed, Myers is a funny man, and he's proved he can parody Bond just well enough to save it from becoming a poor copy. The Dr. Evil (obviously Blofeld) and Frau Frabissner (Rosa Klebb) were genuinely side splitting, but in Goldmember, everything seems a little convoluted.<br />Despite being really mad parodies, the first two films followed a more traditional narrative, whereas Goldmember goes completely off the rails. Michael Caine obviously misses his glory days as Britain's best, but Beyonce Knowles is a pleasant surprise, combining blaxploitation and sassy girl very very well. The script has the cringe worthy jokes that we all laugh at, but they're delivered in a way so they actually seem more cring worthy, but not funny.<br />Awash with cameo's (why Steven Speilberg, why?) from people that obviously had nothing better to do, this is a shameful entry to the otherwise side-splitting series.<br />I was relieved to hear that this was the last AP flick
B0000009SE|5.0|This is a wonderful album with highly imaginative extended brass arrangements (and great playing, of course). In particular, check out &quot;Big Swifty&quot;. It's also got some great recording effects, on the vocal and instrumental parts, which were somehow created by Zappa long before computers were used in recording studios. Think about buying this along with the &quot;Grand Wazoo&quot; and maybe &quot;Hot Rats&quot;, too.
B00004XOWM|4.0|As much as I hate Fred, I just gotta give it to this band because I haven't heard another rock/rap band that can stack up to this one except Linkin Park. Yes, Fred's lyrics are pointless and really show off his ego. Yes, there is an infinite amount of cuss words on this cd. And yes, they are posers. But a lot of these songs just sound so good that I can't stop listening, and I'm not gonna deny that. These guys are good at what they do and I like to listen to them, not get into their personal lives. Just don't expect well written lyrics if you buy this album.<br />Highlights are: &quot;Livin it up&quot;, &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, &quot;Full Nelson&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot;.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Cary Grant and Grace Kelly have great acting in this film. I like how easy they make it look to catch a thief... Thieves who get caught, as we see in this movie- get fired from their jobs. I used to think it was cool to be a thief- until I got caught. Now I know, only I lose in the end...
B00006CXXU|1.0|Well I did like Christina's first cd but you know after her xmas cd I should have had 2nd thoughts about this one as with the xmas cd she just went way over the top bawling out her lungs. <BR>This album I feel is a total mess. I would not recommend it and wish I hadn't wasted my money. It was a big disppointment. I think she's a very confused person if this album is anything to go by and clearly she should not have co-wroted these songs as it's obvious she has no talent in that area.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I am not a Christina Aguilera fan.  I wasn't crazy about her first CD, but recognized that Genie In a Bottle was awesome.  My concern was what did the real Christina sound like minus uses of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.  If you want to know the answer get this CD.  The real Christina (as some of us guessed including me) is Amazing.  You can catch glimpses of her talent in her first CD but it's all over in this second CD.  And what a talent to behold.  She has placed herself in the same caliber as all the other singers who have won Best Female Grammy.  In fact I think with this CD she is a definite shoo-in.  Her range and talent in many ranges of music is incredible.  Her real voice without trying to be like another singer is incredible.  This CD is without question Christina coming on her own and as a number of music critics pointed and what a talent to behold.  It be interesting towards the end of 2002 with some really big names in music coming out with their CD if they can out-talent Christina.  If you listen to this CD with all the range, ability, and creativity this CD will be a hard one to top even with the likes of Carey, Braxton, Hill, etc coming out with their records towards the end of the year.  My prediction: Christina will get a Best Female Grammy this year hands down.
B00005B364|4.0|This isn't too bad.  Hocus Pocus is a really repetitive, yet fun song.  It gets lots of laughs from everyone I play it for.  The next few songs are on the mellow side, but are decent.  The last song is the epic of the album.  It's a great song, sounds alot like Emerson, Lake and Palmer with the do-dee-do-dee keyboards.  Worth checking out if you own the whole Yes/ELP/Rush/King Crimson catalog.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I liked this movie, fast paced and well done, dragons are believable; I just have trouble with the overall premise, dragons taking over the world? Anyway, suspend disbelief and enjoy...
B000002J20|5.0|What a load of pseudo-intellectual crud!  These songs are just silly!  They're way too long, not catchy, and you can't dance to them.  It's totally pretentious and boring.  The philosophical lyrics on this pitiful album are there just to sound \\"smart\\".  It's for people who like to drink complicated coffee orders while reciting poetry as they bang on bongos.  And it's a 2 cd album!  It's also really happy crappy and fluffy sounding.<br />I LOVE IT!!
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This CD presents a very important collaboration. Stan Getz may be the most lyrical tenor saxophone player to have ever graced the face of the earth. Only Lester Young comes close. Prez modeled his sound on that of Frankie Trumbauer's C-melody saxophone, and Getz' model is Prez. Both of them transcend Trumbauer's syrupy improvisations. Getz' tone and the lyricism it supports are evident. All of this is for context, of course. This recording is truly a major musical event. It was on a par with Lester Young's famous collaborations with Teddy Wilson and Oscar Peterson. During this 1957 recording session, all of which is on the CD, Peterson's trio and Getz were more than comfortable with one another, and their mutual musical respect yielded classic performances . The cooperation is evident in Getz' solo on \\"I Want to Be Happy,\\" a model of precision and lyrical invention. Peterson's solos are equally impressive; there's no unnecessary embellishment or decoration, and he swings powerfully. The long ballad medley--\\"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,\\" \\"I Don't Know Why, I Just Do,\\" \\"How Long Has This Been Going On?\\", \\"I Can't Get Started,\\" and \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\\"--features fine solos by Getz and Peterson as well as Herb Ellis on guitar and Ray Brown on bass. In the interplay between the trio and Getz in such numbers as Getz' \\"Bronx Blues.\\" the quartet sounds like a permanent group. In \\"Three Little Words\\" Ellis sets down a solid rhythm and Peterson comps behind Getz' opening solo before delivering an eloquent statement of his own which Getz answers with equal grace. The Getz-Peterson collaboration is particularly appealing on Ellis' \\"Detour Ahead,\\" a prime instance of their treatment of ballad material. On \\"Sunday\\" Ray Brown's persistent bass and Ellis' percussive guitar support Getz admirably. The quartet even approximates a rhythm 'n blues song with Getz' \\"Blues for Herky.\\" It's not every day that you hear Herb Ellis playing blues guitar with Oscar Peterson doingboogie woogie and Stan Getz blowing like he was in a jump band. But here it is, and it comes as a surprise bonus with some really superb jazz.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Other reviewers have spoken of the glory of this disc. You must hear it to believe it. This is what AMERICAN MUSIC is all about. It's honest, heartfelt, executed with stunning precision and fun! This is a must have for anyone who enjoys American music!
B00006RGCT|4.0|This is a relly good movie and it is a good buy.  But to get this movie you have to watch &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;
B00005JL7Q|5.0|this is simply one of the best movies i have seen in years.  the performances are wonderful and the storyline is sweet and sad and hystericlly funny all at once.  the only thing i can recommend is that one reads the book.  i like the ending to the book much better than the movie, and it provides more insight as to the characters.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I would go straight to the point : in the Book, Crawford appears ; in the Book Thomas Harris explains why Lecter became cannibal and it is related to Lecter's childhood and his little sister Misha; what about the Palace of the mind?; in the Book there is Mason Verger's sister who teams with Barney; AND OVERALL IN THE BOOK THE ENDING IS 180 DEGREES OPPOSITE TO BOTH ENDINGS OF THE DVD AND THE THEATRICAL RELEASE : I cannot describe the ending, read the book, it is suprisingly incredible. Why change it totally in the movie, MY GOD !!!.
B000002ADT|5.0|I've must have listened to this recording many times over the last thirty years and I've never gotten bored with it.  This recording can be enjoyed by casual jazz fans and jazz fanatics and musician types like myself.<br />The music is very &quot;accessible&quot; as opposed to the heavy hard bop that turn non-jazzers off.  Yet, for all its accesibility, the music swings from the first beat of the crash cymbal that starts &quot;So What&quot; to the cool &quot;All Blues&quot;.  The haiku-like &quot;Blue in Green&quot; is the closest to a Jazz tone poem I've ever heard before or since.  If i were to characterize this recording with one word it would be &quot;understatement&quot;(maybe that's two words).<br />The personnel: Miles Davis,trumpet;John Coltrane,ten. sax;Cannonball Adderly,alto sax;Paul Chambers, bass; Wynton Kelly and Bill Evans on piano; J. Cobb on drums, have all been freed from the strictures of chord fragments and progressions to create and develop any improvistional idea they could dream up.  This was some revolutionary stuff in the pop song dominated hard bop repertoire of that era. With the exception of &quot;Blue in Green&quot; all the tunes are based on modal scales. Which freed the musicians to play anything they wanted within that scale.<br />Coltrane is superb. It's one of his last dates with Miles before recording exclusively as a leader.  His ideas are muted, inventive and never tired.  Cannonball complemented the horn section with bright,exuberant and rapid fire phrasing.  Miles' &quot;less is more&quot; approach to playing on all of the tunes tie the whole album together into a seamless masterpiece, yes masterpiece.  The spaces between his notes are as much of the music as the notes played.   <br />If you are a musician and want to play with the CD, I would suggest you purchase versions that correct for the original pressing being recorded at a slightly faster speed than the music was actually performed. This resulted in the tones being a half step higher resulting in slightly sharper tones.  If your ear won't or can't detect that, it really doesn't matter which version you pick up just as long as you add this to your collection.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Romantic easy short cuts, great for romantic movie background<br />Makes you sleepy,<br> You won't notice the different in between songs<br />Very flat arrangements<br />I hate it, same setbacks than Diana Krall except Dianna has great legs...<br />Go for Stacey Kent if you are looking for great vocal jazz<br />little culural note:<br>She is one Ravi Shankar's daughters.<br>The sitar player, who taught George Harrison to play the sitar and who played with the Beatles.
B00006RG9K|3.0|Maybe I was just expecting more after viewing Roxy Music(just awesome),Cranberries,Pink Floyd (Pulse--vhs) and Talking Heads I was,sad to say, dissapointed.It is more of a Phil Collins concert video,which is okay, instead of a Genesis concert.This concert is on two dvds,part of concert is on two different discs,Ihave no idea why that was done,its anoying.Its very difficult to find your way around on this disc menu  I thought I was playing \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" and a live commentary track kept playing over the music ;I thought I had some annoying sound interference from a stray radio signal.Plus if I want a slide show and interviews I will buy a book. They should have put all music on one dvd left the junk out then it would be a 4 but not a 5
B000002UAO|5.0|Oh, man!  What a huge step forward the Beatles took with this album!  They went from Help! to Rubber Soul in just a few months, but this must be the hugest step forward any band has taken in that amount of time!  In my opinion, &quot;Help!&quot; is the third worst Beatles album, over Please Please Me and Beatles for Sale. Then RUBBER SOUL, with the sitar on Norweigian Wood, and the wonderful ballads of &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot;, the semi-psychedelic &quot;The Word&quot;, the guitar riffs of &quot;If I needed Someone&quot;, I'm Looking Through You, and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot;, Paul writing some of his best songs in &quot;You Won't See Me&quot;, a perfect Lennon/McCartney collaboration with &quot;Wait&quot;, John taking us on magical journeys with &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;  and &quot;In My Life&quot;, and then when you think the CD's about through, it isn't.  The Beatles flee from the scene with style, giving us the threatening &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;.  One of my favorite George Harrison songs, &quot;Think For Yourself&quot;, is on here, and my favorite Beatles song written by Lennon, besides Strawberry Fields Forever, is included; In My Life.  Although that's not even my favorite Lennon song: &quot;Instant Karma&quot; and &quot;Mind Games&quot;, both post-beatle compositions, take the prize for me.  Altogether, Rubber SOul is my third favorite Beatles album, my second being Sgt. Pepper and my first being Revolver.  Oh, and please check out the White Album, as well. THe BEatles were fantastic, so much better than Elvis that I cannot contain my laughter when thinking about it, and my least favrite of their albums, Please Please Me, I'm gonna give five stars, too.  Everything the Beatles did was amazing, and if your a fan, you should buy all their albums. I'm 14 years old, and I have them all, and am quite proud of my wonderful collection of music.  You should feel the same way.  BUY THIS AND ALL OTHER BEATLES ALBUMS!  ANTHOLOGY TOO!  I can'timagine not owning them all...and being happy.
B00006SFBD|5.0|When I first heard Opeth (Morningrise) I was struck with both the amazing technical skills possessed by the members of the band and the originality of their sound. Successive albums have each done their part to better the previous release. <br />The same holds true for Deliverance. From the first chords of Wreath, the listener is in for a wild ride across an incredibly diverse musical landscape. Many of the songs are heavier and darker than previous releases. (Harkening back to the My Arms, Your Hearse days). There are also more progressive influences in this album (especially the time signatures and start/stop song structures).<br />Each song is in and of itself a masterpiece. The album as a whole is simply astounding. <br />Highlights are: Deliverance, Wreath, For Absent Friends, and By the Pain I See in Others.<br />If you're new to Opeth, this is an excellent place to start. If you're a long time fan, you probably have had this in your cd deck non-stop since 11/12/02.<br />5 stars plus.<br />Opeth: if you guys read these: Well done! Time for a US tour (please) :)
B0000035E7|3.0|This LP proves beyond any doubt that Nirvana was more than Kurt Cobain.  Without Dave Grohl at the drum kit, Nirvana sounds like a thousand other grungy metal bands. The sound on BLEACH is more raw and less powerful than on the big label Grohl-drummed records that the band would do later.<br />Still, Cobain was a certifiable Rock genius and the formula that he would perfect on NEVERMIND can be heard on &quot;Downer&quot; and &quot;About A Girl,&quot; which resurfaced on UNPLUGGED a few years later. &quot;Love Buzz&quot; sounds faintly psychedelic, but the overall vibe here is young, fast, and razor sharp.<br />But I gotta wonder...who is this &quot;Kurdt Kobain&quot; mentioned on the album's credits?  Kurt Cobain's bizzaro world twin?
0425107469|5.0|This was my favorite Koontz book yet! I read it in six days and all i wanted to do was, sit and read, do nothing else, to disturb this gloriuos story. I felt nothing but love for Einstein, and im not worlds biggest dog fan, yet he made this an amazing story. The suspence grips you on page 3 and doesnt let go<BR>The Outsider is always there on the back of your mind, leaving corpses behind as he narrows in on Einstein, Travis and Nora.<BR>I was up till 3 am everynight telling myself ,&quot; just a few more pages&quot; but my intentions went unnoticed compared to this great story, which i could not put down! I recommend it to anyone who craves an interesting and gripping book. I lovded it, and so did a lot of people who read it.<BR>And everytime i see soemeone with a dog, especially a golden retriever i want to ask them if they read this book, because i know they would fall in love with it too.
B00001OH7N|3.0|The songs on THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD are what fans call &quot;progessive&quot; or &quot;artful;&quot; critics label them &quot;self-absorbed,&quot; &quot;pompous&quot; and &quot;pretentious.&quot; <br />Bowie has always walked that line. I have to admit I find it pretentious when he turns his accent off and on, or when, in his stage shows, he used to do mime. But more often than not he hits the nail on the head and his lyrics touch a nerve.<br />I can't agree with the praise of &quot;All The Madmen,&quot; but &quot;The Width Of A Circle&quot; works for me, and &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; is fantastic. It's the only tune on this record with any recognizeable structure, it has that soaring Mick Ronson lead part, and the vocals are mixed forward for a change. It took 25 years, Kurt Cobain and Nirvana to improve this song.<br />If Tony Visconti had been any kind of producer at all this would have been a much better LP.  Bowie's vocals are mixed low, drenched in echo and reverb, and often sound as if they were recorded over a telephone line.  Visconti should have been shown the door.<br />Luckily, Ronson saves the day. The man was a wizard, and there hasn't been anyone who played with such enthusiasm and power since he died.
B000077VPU|5.0|An awesome concert of superstars as a tribute to one of the greatest vocalist of all time.  I still have the original VHS tape and love it.  This DVD (finally) is a must for all the fans of Queen and Rock & Roll music.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|There was never a thought in my head that a sequel to Blade could be just as fun, dark, witty, and great as the original. I was wrong. Blade returns in his justly commendable sequel with just as must action and more bite than the first. More bite is mucho thanks to the events that takes place in the film. Blade is forced to join teams with a group of highly trained vampires to rid of a new breed of vampire called Reapers. These reapers, woo, they were some ugly freaks. They not only feed on humans, but plan to rid the world of vampires too. In Blade 2, it's basically good vs. evil vs. evil vs. good. This whole agenda made for some great plot twists which I didn't see coming at all, and a few I did, but they still were effective. The action is up a notch from the original, and it's all good. Most notable is the \\"House of Pain.\\" Ouch.<br /> Wesley Snipes becomes Blade once again, and adds more depth to the character. Kris Kristoffersoon returns as Whistler. Yep, thought he died in the first one too, but his return is simply and quickly explained. The estrogen in the film comes from Leonor Varela as the daughter of a respected vampire leader. Great actress, and her last scene is quite poetic. <br /> Guillermo del Toro must have known exactly what he wanted, and he must have known what the fans wanted. He pulled all of the right punches, made a great cast of characters (It's all about Scud!), and gave the Blade storyline another level. Here's to a third . . .

0780020685|5.0|I will be the first to admit that foreign movies tend not to interest me, but a friend strongly recommended that I watch this movie sometime.  I was not disappointed in the least.<br />The scene is in medieval Japan where a village is being plagued by bandits, and in desperation hire 7 ronin (samurai without a lord to serve) to fight them.  What you get is a truly epic movie that makes Hollywood movies seem amateur.<br />I really enjoyed the comraderie of the seven samurai.  The movie has a gentle pace at first, as the samurai first assemble one by one.  You get to find out each one's personality and history, and a lot of time is spent on character development.  As you begin to appreciate their individual personalities, the story accelerates into the battle with the bandits.  There is no cheesy Hollywood dramatics, or unnecessary bravado.  Instead, you get a powerful battle that is one for the ages.  You just have to see it.  :)<br />I really can't praise this movie enough.  I was really impressed with Kurosawa's attention to detail (who better to make a Japanese movie than a Japanese director?), time spent getting to know the different characters, and the compelling ending.  I truly enjoyed this movie and I sincerely hope you will too.
0316666343|4.0|I tried to read this book since it was rated so highly, but I could not get into it at all. I am an avid reader, and an author as well, and like almost any sort of book. I just could not find anything satisfying about a young girl watching herself be so brutally murdered, and all that happened to her. I thought it was terrible the way she saw her family go through hell after her death.<br />Perhaps some of my disatisfaction stems from the fact that I am ill myself . . .and I shiver thinking my family and friends will find horror in my death. I want them to think of me in a positive way, and know that I have found a more peaceful place to be. <br />I know a few people who read this book and said that it was ok. Others said it was on a talk show so everyone bought it which made the ratings high . . .Either way, I did not like the book. I do wish the author well in her indevavors. . .
B000001FOL|3.0|On my first listening, I really did not like her voice, her phrasing, or the way she interpreted the songs, which are beautiful. The more I heard it the more it grew on me. It's still not my favorite album of all time, or anything like that, but her deep, pained, melodic voice grows on you and absorbs emotion over time.
B000067G3C|3.0|Whoever at Fox Home Video organized this DVD set forgot to put the DTS digital soundtrack on.  I knew something was wrong when I didn't see the DTS trailer at the beginning of the movie.  Please FOX, go back and put DTS back on Speed.
B000002UAR|2.0|It boils down to this.  Taxman and She Said are good songs.  Good Day Sunshine, Dr. Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, And Got to Get You Into My Life are merely OK. Though it seems to have picked up a cult following, the rest of this album is a mess. <br />Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere are orchestral and just plain boring. I'm Only Sleeping, Love You Too and Yellow Sub are forgettable, and wouldn't even be of mention today if not for the artists.  Finally, Tomorrow Never Knows is just chaotic - no melody, no nothing.<br />2 stars - only because Taxman is so good.
0609610570|3.0|As some of the other reviewers have stated this seems little light on the real &quot;how to get things done&quot; part.  I cannot disagree with anything that is said here and if you are new to the idea of dealing with fact, tactics, and action, then this is a good primer to soften you up before getting into action.  But it still left me feeling that so much has been left out.  This is like the presentation you get that is followed by three times as long on the Q&amp;A session as we all ask loads of questions.  I think the guys know their stuff but I doubt they have put much time into this and the poor old ghost writer has been burning the midnight oil to shape this one up.  I could have been like Gary Hamel's &quot;Leading the Revolution&quot; with so much more check-lists and key question templates.  I think the authors would be dissapointed with how this one worked out if they were not already making shed-loads of money at the day-jobs.  Still I guess it kept Charles Burck busy and gainfully employed
B00005OAIE|5.0|I haven't been this happy with a CD in a very long time. Every song is fantastic; for several months it's virtually the only thing I've listened to. The lyrics are thoughtful and funny--he creates a great story. I saw him in concert this summer and it was a great experience. I'm looking forward to his next CD!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just finished watching the last part.  This series is simply amazing.  I couldn't stop watching it and now that I'm done I wish there was more.  If you've ever read a great book and couldn't put it down 'till it was finished you know what I'm talking about.  Get this DVD set - you will not be disappointed.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This CD features one new song, &quot;you know you're right&quot;.  Other than that, its just a complilation of some of nirvana's greatest hits.  Excellent buy.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I've listened to the new album by Audioslave three times now, and everytime I find new meaning from an arrangement of songs that flow from one to the next, for the purpose of quietly sending out a message to their fans, the critics and everyone in between.  A message that let's us all know that these four individuals will no longer be held back or over-shadowed by their previous band-mates.<br />  Rage was a very political band, probably one of the most political bands in recent times, taking on issues that would have gone unnoticed by the il-educated ignorant masses of the world. Had it not been for Rage's attempt to educate and fight this ignorance, many of us would not be aware of the stuggles of Leonard Peltier or Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Being so out spoken on such issues came at a huge price, eventually leading to the collapse of friendships and most of all, the end of a crusade, a crusade that was to inform the masses of the travisties that go on right under our noses every day.<br />  This new album is not political, it's a spiritual opportunity... the question is, will we be able to see and understand this oppotunity that has been set in front of us.  With eyes open and our minds clear of any pre-set notions as to what this album should be, you can hear what each individual is trying to say, using their instuments and voices as a  vehicle to carry this message and annouce their arrival.  Audioslave is a grown-up, mature sound that will appeal to people of all ages. each person will find their own meanings in the songs, and hopefully learn a little more about themselves... but at the very least you will hear a clean, organized, solid rock and roll album, that starts out fat and leaves you in the lobby of a Jenny Craig Diet Center by the end of the last riff, because the sound and emotion grows fatter and fatter, with no relief till the very end.
B00005YU1O|1.0|I had to give up on this movie after less than 15 minutes because it was making me sick to my stomach -- literally! Not because it's gross, but because the constantly shifting, floating, warping images were producing the same sensation I used to get on car trips when I was a kid. I've learned from experience (boat rides, airplane flights, etc.) that I am much more susceptible to motion sickness than most people, and Waking Life made me very queasy, very fast.  (And from the 10-15 minutes I did see, the dialog is no prize either; kind of like what you'd hear at a university-area coffee house at 2 am.)<br />I realize that many other people think this is a really wonderful movie, but if you have motion-sickness tendencies, stay away!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I haven't listened to the actual album release yet, only the 13-song demo collection that leaked out earlier in 2002.  But, based on the strength of those recordings, it's safe to say that Audioslave is a brilliant project and the perfect marriage of Rage and Soundgarden.  You get the bombastic intrumental machine of the former Rage musicians, welded to the more-melodic stylings of Chris Cornell.  Hopefully, the ridiculous politics that brought a clownish aspect to Rage will take a back seat to the music - although the renaming of 'Save Yourself' as 'Cochise' and Tom Morello's insistence upon linking the song to romantic notions about native american resistence should prove a sop to those who want lefty polemics with their hard rock.  Run, do not walk, to purchase this album.
6303269826|5.0|One of the best movie's ever made! So watch it... buy it actually...I still enjoy watching mine, after \\"many\\" viewings!<BR>WHEN WILL IT BE OUT IN DVD...my tape will probably wear out soon!
B00003CXI1|2.0|Hmmm.  This is one of the most financially successful movies ever made, based on the equally successful line of books by J. K. Rowling.  I'm puzzled by the popularity of this film; the plot is rambling and never really gives the viewer time to get to know the main characters.  As such, I found I didn't particularly care about what happened to them.  The actors did a fine job (given the material they had to work with), but it just seemed empty to me.  <br />Movies based on books always have to omit huge amounts of material but it seems like the characters suffered the most in this adaptation.  I'd much rather have had less of the sportplayed with flying broomsticks (and the giant chess game) and much more characterization.
B00006M183|5.0|not quite as good as 10 but its up there...<br />songs you should check out are &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; &quot;I Am Mine&quot; &quot;Save You&quot; &quot;Green Disease&quot; and &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;
0887307280|5.0|Good and informative, but entertaining at the same time.  This will give easily-implemented ideas for creating a successful business.<br />One of the things I found most useful about this book was the real-life examples that Gerber uses.
B00006YXEK|5.0|'Brainwashed', the album George Harrison was working on before his death last year, is a beautiful coda to his magnificent body of work. Containing a lot of his recognizable and haunting slide guitar work, the songs are lovely and clever, filled with equal doses of Harrison's spiritual faith and acerbic wit. It's hard to pick a favorite song from this collection because they are all excellent. A favorite of mine is 'Looking for my Life', I've played this one several times. Others are the instrumental 'Marwa Blues' and the radio single 'Stuck Inside a Cloud', whose catchy melody will play in your head after you finish listenting to it. George has a playful moment with Hoagy Carmichael's 'The Devil & The Deep-Blue Sea' on his ukelele, and does a down-home blues on 'Rocking Chair in Hawaii'.<br />I brought the limited edition version with bonus goodies like a poster, an official guitar pic, a sticker and a dvd on the making of the album. It's a pity Harrison is no longer with us so we can thank him for this excellent collection of new songs, which can stand proudly with his collective solo and Beatles cataloge. George Harrison left us with a lovely parting gift with 'Brainwashed' and it will be a welcomed addition to his musical legacy. God bless you, George.
B000001FDE|5.0|In 1969 session guitarist Duane Allman put together what would become one of the best rock bands in America. The lineup included two drummers(Jaimo Johanson & Butch Trucks), bass player (Berry Oakley), singer and organist (brother Greg Allman) and another lead guitarist (Richard Betts). What was immediately notable, apart from two drummers, was the way Duane Allman and Richard Betts played twin lead guitars - either in harmony or taking turns at solos. The music on the first four albums ('The Allman Brothers Band', 'Idlewild South', 'At Filmore East' & 'Eat a Peach') was blues rock with some jazz & country influences. What gained the band a name was their live shows with extended jams which featured the incredible guitar work by Allman & Betts. Many blues rock fans regard these albums as their finest work.<BR>In late October 1971 tragedy struck when Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. The band had been working on the fourth album 'Eat a Peach' and they now completed it with Richard Betts playing all lead & slide guitar parts. The album consisted of studio material (including the last guitar work by Duane Allman) & a live track 'Mountain Jam'. One song on the album written and sung by Richard Betts was the first indication of the sound he would bring to the band on their next album 'Brothers and Sisters'. The song was 'Blue Sky'.<BR>Instead of trying to replace the guitar of Duane Allman, the band introduced Chuck Leavell on piano as the second soloist, but while they were working on their next album, Berry Oakley was also killed in a motorcycle accident. <BR>Lamar Williams was recruited on bass and with Richard Betts as the defacto band leader the new lineup eventually finished work on the record. The completion of 'Brothers and Sisters' was a triumph over adversity and the band were rewarded with no.1 on the album charts after it's release in 1973.<BR>'Brothers and Sisters' showcased Richard Betts' ability as a great singer songwriter as well as a brilliant guitarist. Another feature was Chuck Leavell's outstanding piano work. Greg Allman contributed three tracks: 'Wasted Words'-  and  the highlights,'Come and Go Blues' & 'Jelly Jelly', - but it was Betts who  changed the focus of the band's sound with a more melodic country rock influence on the standout tracks: 'Ramblin' Man', 'Southbound', 'Jessica', and 'Pony Boy'.  <BR>'Brothers and Sisters' stands as a classic album in the history of the Allman Brothers Band and American Rock Music.
B00005R8FI|5.0|This remarkable album featured something new in blues-rock music. Mayall formed a band with no drums and no electric lead guitar, relying on the bass of Steven Thompson to keep the rhythm, and substituting acoustic \\"finger-style\\" guitar in place of the blistering electric licks that had been a prominent feature of Mayall's style. The format was not new to Mayall; the liner notes to the \\"Room to Move\\" compilation state that he got the idea from another, less well-known band. Regardless, Mayall's sound on Turning Point was unique; the use of woodwinds and acoustic guitar, combined with Mayall's harmonica, flirted around the outermost fringes of jazz, and the live tracks presented here are smooth and flowing, reaching a peak in the magnificent \\"California\\" which became a staple of FM radio for a time. \\"Room to Move\\" was the closest Mayall would ever come to a bona fide hit in the U.S.<br />Unfortunately, this was a turning point for John Mayall, commercially and artistically. Shortly after this release, blues went out of fashion, and the quality of Mayall's work plummeted. The no-drums format became increasingly difficult to work with in large, noisy concert halls and was eventually scrapped.<br />Mayall has returned to produce fine work in the 1980s and 1990s; his most recent release, \\"Stories\\", is one of his best; and he released first-rate albums such as \\"Chicago Line\\" and \\"A sense of Place\\" in the 80s. At close to 70, he is still recording and performing new work, but \\"The Turning Point\\" remains the high watermark of his career. This is one of the great albums of the 1960s, and one not to be missed.<br />This version has three \\"extra\\" tracks, and I'm happy to say that they're excellent and well worth the price of the disc, even if you own a copy of the original CD.  I wish there was more of this stuff!
B00006X06U|5.0|Travelogue is a collection of some of Joni's most lyrically and musically outstanding material reinterpreted through the use of a 70 piece orchestra with arrangements by Vincent Mendoza who worked on Joni's 2000 album Both Sides Now and last year's Vespertine by Bjork.<br />Some of the highlights include The Dawntreader, The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song), Amelie, and Trouble Child among others.<br />But whole cd really excells as a whole.<br />Good job Joni!  I hope this really isn't your last record.
B00005LPE5|5.0|I'll keep it short; This is an amazing album! I am very picky about music and it's rare that I find an album that has more than 4 songs on it that I like. I was stunned when picked up this album and heard 14 awesome rock songs in a row! Melodic rock, beautiful vocals and haunting lyrics. A true masterpiece and a must for any rock fan.
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is stunningly beautiful.  If you're willing to slow down your mental pace for a little over an hour and listen to it all (which I usually don't do when I listen to it, btw), you'll be rewarded with one of the most touching and complex albums out there.  This is one of the very few albums whose appeal only increases over time with me.  Corgan's lyrics are very dense and wordy, but if you look at them line by line, it's really beautiful and. . .accurate.  Not melodramatic, like Mellon Collie (which is of course amazing as well.  Their intention was to be over the top on MCIS).  There are about seven songs on Adore that are absolutely mindblowing:  To Sheila, Ava Adore, Tear, Shame, Behold! The Night Mare, and For Martha are perfect.
B000007177|4.0|1972 - Tull delivers one of the greatest progressive rock albums ever with the release of 'Thick as a Brick'.  Then, what happened in '73?  They fled to France for a tax exile and laid down the framework for another potential masterpiece.  But....the work achieved there never saw the light of day.  Instead, sections of the tape were reworked and released as 'A Passion Play'. / After hearing the original delivery on this double disc set, I have to ask - - Why!?!  What the hell was Anderson thinking?  The original 'vision' for 'APP' is fueled with fire, feeling, intensity and much integrity.  The released 'version' of it is NOT.  What caused this error in judgment?  A little too much herb, perhaps?  It couldn't be the record companies.  Not yet.  Not in '73.<br />I've been a Tull addict since the remasters have come out, and, hearing this band - being afforded the same richness and clarity of today's technology, has instantly put them on my top-ten of all-time.  Picked up Aqualung first (had it on vinyl as a kid), then 'TAAB', followed by 'Stand Up.  Feeling confident from the choices in the previous three selections, I bought 'Nightcap' on a whim.  Satisfied as a mother-father up until this point....Yeah,  Bigtime.  Then, i say to myself, let's pick up 'A Passion Play'.  It's based on the work done on disc one of 'Nightcap'....Has to be even better. Right?  blah. Wrong.  Something, Everything was lost in the translation and the trek back to England.  My 'Passion Play' disc was instantly remanded back to the Used-CD store.  It was passionless compared to the keeper - 'Chateau'.  <br />The album 'A Passion Play' is extracted from tracks 7-13 off of what is coined as the 'Chateau d'Isaster' tapes on this 'Nightcap' collection.  The above referenced files are on the same par as any note evidenced on 'Thick as a Brick', but instead of a solid, tightening re-write and subsequent release, this rough draft was filed away for twenty-someodd years.  Very upset, and feeling a need to rationalize, i have dubbed the tracks on 'Nightcap' as 'my own passion play album', as it insistently and progressively blows the doors off of the official studio release.  On my dream version of this '73 album , 7-13 would be retained in its rawest form and appear on side two - aptly entitled 'A Passion Play'.  Side One would be a heavy reworking of tracks 1-6, taking on its own theme and ingested separtely from Side Two (a la Rush 2112, in reverse).  They are great tracks to begin with and an Anderson second-retelling of them would serve 'em proper.  That would have made a hell of an album.  But, we're left with this divergence of reality instead.  Better off to live in mine.<br />Disc two of 'Nightcap' is compiled from 80's and 90's material and is - - AS good as anything that has appeared in album form.  Some tunes, i have to say, i like better than their chronological counterparts.  I could just imagine the wait this double-album was for longtime Tull fans.  Pick this up.  Get fat on Ian.   -[}TULL{]-<BR> P.S . (genius):<BR>....While ladies get their bedding done<BR>To win themselves a bouncing son--<BR>But bad girls do it for the fun of just 'being'.<BR>And me, I'm here to sing along,<BR>And I'm not concerned with righting wrongs,<BR>Just asking questions that belong without an answer.<BR>But God is laughing up his sleeve<BR>As He pours himself another cup of tea,<BR>And He waves good-bye to you and me, at least for now.
0375823360|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite book series. The descriptions are so incredibly beautiful and complex, all of it really makes you think. I was  in an entirely different world the entire time I was absorbing these books. I highly reccomend this to anyone who has any kind of imagination at all!

B00006LJ72|5.0|There are no words to give the due honor to all who participated in the creation of this truly spectacular arrangement!<br />This selection of ever favorite songs, arranged by Enya, Nicky, and Roma, from the &quot;debut soundtrack album&quot; &quot;the Celts&quot; to the lastest masterpieces that shall be unforgotten for all time.  This CD set contains a 24 page booklet of inspired beauty and splendor.  There is much information unknown to many written within, although it is recommended that &quot;the listener derives their own special meanings from the songs,&quot; you may find much may be to your advantage in your listening experience.  This is a wonderful buy for any who love the sound of Enya's amazing music and outstanding lyrics, as there is a limited supply of 200,000 copies in this worldwide release- Do not hesitate for the time may come but once and after it passes there may not be another chance!  <br />   Although I love every one of Enya's songs, it surprised me to learn so much about her, that I may never hear some songs the same again - they now hold a newer and greater magic that touches my very soul!  I would never allow myself to miss this opportunity.  I orderd this collection long before its release, and after such a long wait, I found that my passion for these songs has deepened, and I now hold Enya, Roma, and Nicky in a much higher respect!  I thank them for all of their work!<br />Thank you!<BR>  -Thomas Barnett
B00005Y228|1.0|That pretty much sums this album up.  There's not enough to it to warrant many more words.  Any guy who listens to this album (unless forced to by an extremely attractive female) should have his &quot;dude&quot; license revoked.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is near flawless in my opinion, what does this mean to you aside from some random guy worshipping an album you know nothing about?<br />Nothing really but if you like progressive, experimental music this is your band and album.<br />Tool takes the heavy melodic road to an experience,  I've compared them to a modern day Zeppelin or Floyd.  Bands who use their music to display the power and emotion they have in it.<br />Don't get me wrong I'm not saying Tool is Floyd or that Tool is Zeppelin, but I'm saying elements are there<br />This album is incredibly edgy.  You grit your teeth and yell with Maynard, you feel what he feels.  You enter a spiritual journey guided by your mind and their music.  <br />I think I have nothing more to say how I feel<br />Shut up and buy their record
0441003257|3.0|The title gets it absolutely right.  \\"Good\\" Omens.  Not stellar, not great, not even fine omens, but good ones, all packed together in this discardable little book by humor-fantasy meister Terry Pratchett and dark-fantasy meister Neil Gaiman.<br />It's a comic novel about the end of days and darned if I didn't laugh out loud.  A lot.  But the jokes were cheap and easy and didn't really showcase the talents of either of these writers.<br />Aziraphale and Crowley shine as the main characters and turn the novel into a sort of Crosby & Hope \\"Road to Armaggedon\\" kind of story.  Their appearances are the only worthy bits in the entire novel.  The rest reads as more a Three Stooges movie.<br />If this sound sappealing to you, more power to you.  Admittedly, I liked it enough to read a second time, many years after the first reading, but that was because I had finished \\"American Gods\\" and was in the mood for another dose of Gaiman that would not soon be forthcoming.  I knew what I was getting into, however, knew I would be reading a light, airy fantasy without any real meat to it, but for some reason that wasn't enough the second time around.  <br />This is a charming book to use killing an hour or two, but don't try to make a meal of it.  You'll starve to death.
0375414053|3.0|Okay, I know this is a parody, but is there a working mother out there who could identify with this woman?  She doesn't seem to like her children, she treats her husband abhorantly, and her crises are self-made!  (I mean, really, the kid doesn't need a Teletubbies cake, he needs his Mommy at home from her business travel!) Life as a working mother is hectic, but this woman made herself a victim.  Also the story seems to be missing.  Buy the Nanny Diaries -- it's better.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Entertaining for both children and adults.  It's a fun and witty movie the whole family can enjoy.
0316926345|5.0|I can't read this book without remembering that it was written during the war, at a time when it really did look like the world might end at any moment.  Waugh must have felt that he had to work it all out on paper, Catholic v. Protestant, homosexual v. heterosexual, sinner v. saint.  This book is incredibly beautiful in passages, tragically bleak in others.  You won't easily forget it.
0380977788|5.0|I read this book in one sitting.  When I finished, I wished I would have read slower.  The characters are delightful to spend time with.  I have never read a Neil Gaiman novel, but plan to after this delightful book.  The illustrations are excellent fun, as well.  I find myself comparing this to 'The Thief of Always'by Clive Barker, which is one of my favorite fantasy books.
B00005LLK8|5.0|Set during Northern England's miners' strike of 1984, Billy Elliot is a heart-warming, inspiring story about an eleven-year-old boy from a poor working-class family who aspires, despite the odds, to be a ballet dancer.  Billy, however, lives with his elder brother and his father, both of whom are striking miners and neither of whom can abide let alone comprehend Billy's desire to take ballet lessons.  It simply isn't done.  It's not for a lad, and that's that. <br />Billy struggles to follow both his heart and his innate talent in order to break free from a less-than-ideal (and at times even violent) home life and the prospects of a bleak future.   As a result, walls, cages, barriers and other images of entrapment figure prominently in the film, underscoring his predicament, and his dancing (by which means he struggles to break free) is powerfully juxtaposed with scenes of the violence, rage, and hatred in the community at the time.  <br />The Special Edition of the video contains a 20 minute blurb (after the closing credits) with the show's stars, producers, and director talking about the film, the characters, and the situation in England at the time, all of which is interspersed with brief clips from the film.<br />The film is a 2000 BBC co-production with a running time of 111 minutes.  Apart from a superb storyline that is powerfully portrayed, the acting is absolutely first rate by all involved.  The Northumberland accents may be a little difficult at first for some, but it's nothing that can't be overcome with close attention, and it's well worth the effort.  <br />In short, I'd highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving and inspiring yet rough-around-the-edges story of a lad intent upon breaking free and following his dreams in spite of the odds.  This is not some slick but gooey, maudlin Hollywood-style production, and in my opinion it's all the better for it.  The production is extremely well done--all the more so for being done in a manner so sensitive to the subject matter and the setting.

B00000GUZP|5.0|&quot;Aliens&quot; creator H.R.Giger is responsible for the out-of-this-world look of Harry on the cover, suggesting that the musical contents found within would be anything but ordinary.<br />And they really are a mixture of styles, as have other reviewers have suggested.<br />I just love what Chic-meisters Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards did for the punk-rock diva.<br />This is definitely not a &quot;backfire&quot; and holds its own with the best of Harry's work with Blondie.
B00002E23E|2.0|The sound is poor as it prologic and very centre channel,the video is hacked up and out of synch with the energy on stage, the off stage sequences are rediculous and unnecessary But it is Led Zep and therefore good to watch Page at work. Bonham is an animal, I think Keith Moon would have gotten out of breath trying to keep up on the skins. I think the camera work spent too much time on Plant below the belt and we would have all been served better above the waist.
B000002HPV|4.0|Iceland is a place of wilds, and wilder wilds, where glaciers and volcanoes coexist uneasily with one another -- and the people there reflect that unusual mixture of fire and ice. Reserved on one hand, violently passionate on the other, they are probably one of the most unique, inscrutable populations on the face of the earth. <br />A perfect example is Bjork Gudmundsottir, former lead singer of the Sugarcubes, currently one of the most unique and thrilling artists in modern music. Her work is a law unto itself; like Bjork it's a distillation of her culture: rigidly arranged and produced, yet also wild and free flowing. \\"I thought I could organize freedom/how Scandinavian of me!\\" Bjork sings during \\"Hunter,\\" the first track on 1997's Homogenic -- and while the line raises a knowing smile, it's also telling that she would use such a sentiment to open the album. Homogenic was Bjork's freest, most experimental, and most challenging album up to that point. It is also her least organized album -- not necessarily a bad thing, though it does lead to missteps as the album progresses.<br />Homogenic starts promisingly, with two songs as daring as any Bjork has ever recorded. First is the aforementioned \\"Hunter,\\" with its eerie swirls of accordion and backing vocals, its dramatic, sweeping, even percussive string arrangements, and Bjork's calm, even quiet singing, in counterpoint to the restless lyrics: \\"I'm not stopping/I'm going hunting.\\" The song peaks with the climbing notes in the bridge, and Bjork's multi-tracked voice, singing the same lines again and again, until the resulting miasma of sound raises goosebumps. <br />The next song, \\"Joga,\\" is one of the singer's finest moments, describing love as a \\"state of emergency,\\" a puzzle to be solved, a \\"coincidence [that] makes sense/only with you,\\" and does so while surging over, under, and around a chorus of strings, a pulsing bassline, and background percussion that could best be described as seismic in its intensity.<BR><BR>And \\"seismic\\" is a fairly accurate description of the entire album. Whereas on previous releases the percussion, whether programmed or \\"organic,\\" was crisp and clean, here the beats sound submerged, subterranean. They rumble like ocean waves, like the erupting volcanoes and calving glaciers of Bjork's homeland. This comes up repeatedly, in songs as gentle as the romantic \\"Unravel,\\" as strident as the thrumming power-ballad \\"Bachelorette,\\" and as harsh as the dark and dissonant \\"Pluto.\\" It's a long way to this from songs like \\"Crying,\\" \\"Big Time Sensuality,\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" on previous albums; more timid listeners can hardly be blamed for not following Bjork into these newer realms of sound&amp;#61628;particularly songs such as \\"All Neon Like,\\" with its underwater- bass sound and trip-hop-dance-hall-reggae sensibility. <BR> <BR>Bjork herself seems as if she couldn't care less. She says as much in \\"5 Years,\\" where she complains about \\"cowards/that say they want/and then they can't handle,\\" and dares you to take her on, over music that is almost all distorted, compressed, programmed beats. It is the least musical song on the album; in spite of the bravery and bravado of the lyrics, it doesn't really belong here. In my opinion it shocks you out of the mood that has been so powerfully building up to that point, and I think Bjork may have gotten a little carried away on this track. But the chiming, charming \\"Immature\\" brings things back into focus, with its simple lyrics and orchestration. Bjork's vocals are in fine form, neither overpowering the song nor letting it get away from her, as on \\"5 Years.\\"<BR> <BR>\\"Alarm Call\\" sends things spinning in another direction altogether, and surprises the listener again. It's one of the most finely crafted pieces of radio fodder I've ever heard, with its poppy, bouncy bassline, its memorably singable melody, and clever \\"beep-beep\\" backing vocals. That's not the surprising part -- Bjork has proven more than once what an excellentsongwriter she is. What amazes me is that this incredible song was, with typical Bjorkian nerve, never released as a single! That speaks of supreme self-confidence, and one can't help being impressed by it. <BR> <BR>Equally impressive are the two closing tracks, \\"Pluto\\" and \\"All Is Full of Love.\\" The former song is a pounding distortion-fest that hearkens back to some of the grittier tracks on Post, such as \\"Army of Me\\" and \\"Enjoy,\\" but outstrips them both. There's a punky energy here that's missing from those songs, and Bjork really lets rip with those amazing pipes of hers, growling, howling, and roaring her way right through to the climax.<BR> <BR>\\"All Is Full of Love\\" is another of the experimental songs Bjork uses to close her albums, and this one's a wowzer. It's at once earthy and ethereal, strange and familiar; known instruments like harps, accordions and synthesizers collide with one another, becoming new. Laid over this is the singer's voice, cajoling, comforting, even chiding, rising over the enveloping sounds as she sings over and over that \\"all is full of love/you just ain't receiving\\" -- and somewhere in that voice is the promise that, if you are patient, you will receive. <BR> <BR>If one thing sums up the diverse sprawl of Homogenic, it's this: towards the end of \\"Joga,\\" the music swells up into a sweet coda of strings and rising vocal notes; then the original string arrangement comes back in, and Bjork begins singing the \\"state of emergency\\" chorus again. As she does there's a little laugh in her voice, a laugh of delight at what she's created. That's Bjork in a nutshell: taking pure delight in a workplace that is also a playground, a playground of fire and ice, where seismic sounds paint emotional landscapes. Homogenic captures that feeling as well as any of her albums, flaws and all, and in my opinion it's more than worth owning.
0142000663|4.0|The book reflects on the struggles that the poor farmers went through during the Period of Depression. As for Joad's family , they decided to move to California to find better jobs and get a new life. On the trip to California, Joad's family met other family that also moved to the West. They helped each others to survive through the hardship. The humanity that people had for each other was so wonderful, and nothing was better than that. I don't think nowaday we can have that humanity in society because as time has changed, people don't share similar experience and it hard for them to understand each other.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's got everything anyone would want in a movie: Adventure, action, love, mystery, special effects, comedy and a great message: That everyone should be judged by who they are rather than what they look like. The DVD specials are also amazing and very entertaining, altough Chip's Challenge Game has been difficult at times. Overall, excellent!
6302787068|4.0|Alladin is a great film for children, although a lot of adults have already seen and really enjoyed it.<BR>The soundtrack is amazing, specially a song called A WHOLE NEW WORLD, which all children seem to know by heart.<BR>I recommend it and it's ceartain that the film won't desapoint you.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I LOVE this soundtrack with a passion! I am a total Lord of the Rings Fan, and I believe Howard Shore completed the difficult task of creating music to go along with this complex story with great results. I personally like &quot;Aniron&quot; the best. The story of Aragorn and Arwen is my favorite theme in the books and movie. The tone of the orchestration and Enya's voice coincide perfectly with each other. I highly reccommend it. Can't wait until The Two Towers Soundtrack is available!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I just picked up this cd on my lunch break and it is outstanding.  This albumn features vintage Cornell.  His voice sounds as it did on Temple of the Dog, Louder Than Love,  and Badmotorfinger.  This cd reminds me of my high school days when Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and STP, first came out.  Great rock album.
0767906543|5.0|I just finished this book today, and I have already told everyone I met how funny this book is. You would have guessed from the title that it is about a relationship ... the relationship of Mel &amp; Duffy through the eyes of Duffy ... I found it very interesting to see the point of view of Duffy about his relationship ... there is a certain innocence in him (that I think we find in every man) which makes even the most normal scenes very funny ...(loved it when he describes the day at IKEA with Mel) <BR>I laughed throughout the whole book ...<BR>In the same category there is 'Junk Mail', very funny as well
B00005OCMR|4.0|TRON is one of the most overblown kid movies ever made.  The plot, in which a hacker is sucked into a computer and must battle evil programs to escape(!), is ludicrous on so many levels that you'll probably be tempted to just skip the first fifteen minutes of the movie all together.  And why not?  After all, it's the special effects that are the lone saving grace of this film.<br />But what a saving grace they are!  This film looks GREAT. The filmmakers did a perfect job of capturing a uniquely 80s view of the inside of computers and video games.  There is talk of a sequel, and if it comes to fruition, I can promise you that, while it may look very different, it won't look any better than the original TRON.  It can't.  This film is a feast for the eyes, and the stupid plot (that tries very obviously to be a religious parable) actually enhances the experience by giving us the opportunity to turn off our brains and sit back and enjoy the visuals.  A must have for any fan of visual effects.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was introduced to Avril Lavigne by a friend of mine, in turn I bought the CD. Which really hit me by surprise. I'm not into Britny Spears, Cristina Agulara, or any other &quot;Teeny Bopper Band&quot;.  But Avril caught me off guard, because I wasn't expect so much from this 16 year old is why I did get so much.  Its amazing that this girl could write so much, so well. The way the words are expressing her feelings, and how the music fits so well. Its like it was meant to be. If this is what a 16 year old can say about her life experiences, imagine what she'll have to say when she's 26. I know I'm looking forward to what's next. Let's Go.
B00005JL3A|4.0|As a lover of science fiction movies, I am too often disappointed by their ridiculous and over-the-top production and implausible plots.  While I grudgingly accept that far out tales are what make science fiction actual fiction, let's have some grounding in reality, okay?  This isn't the best movie I've ever seen, and far from the best sci-fi adventure I've watched, but it's certainly worth two hours of time.<br />The basic plot deals with a an elite group of characters trained for combat who are sealed underground in a complex known as the &quot;Hive.&quot;  A deadly neurotoxin is purposely filtered through air vents and kills all who it comes into contact with.  Supposedly.  Soon you discover than while the toxin kills unmercifully, it also reanimates the corpses of its victims!  Think Frankenstein en masse set loose in a labrinyth.<br />Milla Jovovich is a capable actress, but good acting really doesn't drive this movie.  She's at least believable.  Rodriguez is over the top, but in a good way, as the ever-vigilant militant soldier.  Good action sequences and superb special effects render this movie one to consider.
B000067CPX|5.0|I absolutely adore this cd, and constantly find myself listening to it. Anthony's voice just melts me.<br />Venice Queen - This song is beautiful, the first time I listened to this cd I can say that..I didn't listen to it all the way through, but after I did, I was amazed.<br />Universally Speaking - It took me a while to like this song, but it grew on me.<br />Throw Away Your Television - Sorry, I just don't care for this song, it's definitely my LEAST favorite.<br />This is the Place - I like the attitude, hah. This song is good.<br />Zephyr Song - Loved this song, that is until I saw the video. Still a great song though.<br />Warm Tape - Again, this wasn't one of my faves at first until I heard the chorus, which is beautiful. AWESOME.<br />Tear -  OOOH Anthony. Listen to this song, it's mahhhvelous.<br />On Mercury - Different, but I like it a lot.<br />Minor Thing - This song is alright. Reminds me of &quot;Can't Stop&quot;<br />Midnight - Adore this song. I love the lyrics, and Anthony's voice sounds so soft and sweeeeet.
630289915X|5.0|I didn't discover this jewel until I caught it on cable television in the 1980's.  Now I own a copy, and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is watched faithfully each Holiday Season--often several times.<br />Frank Capra's endearing classic is the ultimate feel-good movie, like a sip of hot chocolate to warm the throat following a festive night under the stars looking at lights.  All of us readily identify with George Bailey, a common man with big dreams and grand expectations.  But when George's life consistently fails to meet his expectations, he becomes more disillusioned, disappointed.  If only he could have traveled the world, designed and built the skyscrapers and bridges he talked about as a boy, his life would be meaningful.<br />And then George faces the ultimate conflict:  possible bankruptcy, scandal, and imprisonment.  He contemplates what, quite frankly, many of us would contemplate at such a time--suicide.  Instead, he is given the ultimate gift:  a chance to see what life would be like had he never been born.  What he sees is bleak, even hopeless, and suddenly George realizes:  his life has been meaningful, all along.  And the majestic magnitude of his life is manifested during the film's final scene, when George's family and friends embrace him and rush to his aid.<br />James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore lead an exceptional cast in this wondrous film.  Released in 1947, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a timeless classic that will be just as entertaining in 2047 and all the years to follow.<br />&quot;To George Bailey, the richest man in Bedford Falls!&quot;
B00006M183|5.0|I normally do not acknowlege, read, or give any type of reviews, but this time curiosity got the best of me.  I decided to check out a few reviews of \\"Riot Act\\" just to see where the hearts of PJ fans truly lie.  I am not going to waste your time like many of my fellow reviewers by going down the tracklist of this album and telling you my favorites.  The whole is my favorite.  Reserve judgment and listen in its entirety;  if you are a real PJ and a real music fan, you will understand this.  I am also disgusted with all of the \\"PJ fans\\" who are looking for the next \\"ten.\\"  This was a GREAT piece of work, but nobody wants to hear the same songs over and over on seven different releases.  If you are looking for mtv-friendly songs which have nothing to say,don't buy this album because it actually means something.  PJ didn't make this music for you or me...it is for them, and we should all be thankful they decided to share it.  So if you want something which is catchy but doesn't say anything, please stick to bands like the \\"Wish we were Pearl Jam\\" Creed.
0380778556|5.0|I had to read this book as required reading in high school.  I didn't think it would interest me, but happily, it did!!  Everything about it was fascinating, from the characters to Manderley to Ms. DuMaurier's graceful (if somewhat rambling)prose.  Naturally, I read the sequel MRS. de WINTER immediately after it was published. I am in the process of reading the third book in the series, REBECCA'S TALE.<br />REBECCA is narrated my the nameless Mrs. de Winter.  A traveling companion and servant to a snobbish socialite, Mrs. de Winter is swept off her feet by Maxim de Winter, a wealthy and sophisticated widower, while on vacation in Monte Carlo with her employer.  After a whirlwind courtship and quick, quiet wedding, Maxim whisks her away to Manderley, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast in England.  She's not there long before she realizes that her predecessor, the ineffably beautiful and accomplished Rebecca, is everywhere yet nowhere, dead yet still alive, gone yet not forgotten.  And no one underscores these sentiments more strongly than Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's housekeeper who had been Rebecca's loyal serving woman.  Constantly haunted by Rebecca's memory and forced to do battle with Maxim's odd mood swings, Mrs. de Winter fights to hold her own in her new milieu.  The turning point in the story comes with the discovery of Rebecca's sunken sailboat at the bottom of the bay, and with it horrifying new revelations that she may not have drowned but had been murdered instead.  A series of suspenseful events follows that will keep you on the edge of your seat as the de Winters fight for their love and their lives, and the story concludes with a shocking ending.<br />The movie, made in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock, is also excellent and stays pretty true to the novel.
B00006YXEK|3.0|on the dvd which came with new george recording george states his wish that these last tracks he'll ever have a chance to make be kept \\"demo\\"sounding. bare, just he and his guitar. jeff lynne on the same little trailer admits \\"george wanted these tracks in a real natural demo state but I and i underscore I, the great mondo producer, the great and powerful lynne \\"felt they deserved the full treatment. sorry George.\\" well mr. lynne, you ruined some tracks that would have been so much better without your formulaic \\"driving wheel\\" stale, rehashed methods. it's a sin, you are so dim mr. lynne. the only song that was a true knockout punch for me was, track 10. between the devil and the deep blue sea [harold arlen number] this is the artistic level to which george had evolved, playing in his favorite style. i which he had enough faith in himself to have done a whole album of standards such as these. he does such a beautiful and unique thing with this song. sounds jeff free. track 6, marwa blues, hauntingly beautiful,is my next favorite. and lastly track 10, rocking chair in hawaii is cool. the rest are much like others he has done with monsoir lynne in the past. boy do i hope there are tapes of him playing other songs in the style of track 10. that would excite me. georges' son dhani seems like a very nice young man. i would suggest you all spring for the box which includes a signed guitar pick a poster and dark horse bumper sticker. love ya george.
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton is arguably the best white guitar player that ever picked up the instrument. But on 'Unplugged' he dies it down a few notches to bring up a type of passion, and fortitude that is not shown in his studio albums. From the acoustic version of 'Layla', to the masterpiece, 'Tears In Heaven' this album is arguably the best live album ever. <br />This was the first album that I purchased of Clapton's when I was 12, and is still an album that I listen to today, dispite my friends thinking that I am crazy and old-fashioned for it. <BR>So I will leave you with saying to pick up this release, and if you don't, you are missing out on a remarkable 'Live' album.
B000066I6N|3.0|This one is a bit strange. On one hand I think it is a beautiful and brilliant, passionate album. On the other hand I think that he lost a bit of his power. What I miss here are new songs after so many years without doing it solo, and the frue fire he used to have, it is also sad to notice that his voice, THE voice of rock,  is not what it used to be. <BR>But, can't wait for the next album, as this time he put a realy good band together. Sadly missing only is Michael Lee.
B000002MTU|5.0|One thing that should become obvious after listening to 'From The Cradle' by Eric Clapton is that he is trying to pay homage to his blues heroes(Clapton was originally a straight forward blues player back in the early days) and not trying to rip them off. It seems to me that Eric Clapton knows the blues and all of his passion is into playing it and he is releasing it out on his guitar. <br />Anyways; 'From The Cradle' is a blues masterstroke, perfect for any young guitar player who loves the blues, but also likes to rock. Fortunately, Clapton does both; simultaneously on this record, and performs it to perfection. Being one of the greatest living guitar players, Clapton shouldn't be tied down to just playing blues, or just playing acoustic music, or just playing rock, he should have all right to mix all 3 or just do a single one. On this album he chose to play the blues the way it should be played. <br />This album has no compromises on it. It is blues tothe core and rock in the heart, just the way good electric blues should be. From the cover of Muddy Waters 'Hoochie Coochie Man' to Elmore James' 'It Hurts Me Too' he makes rock fans appreciate blues music and vice versa. While most of Clapton's newer material is more prone to being pop-rock with scatterings of blues, I choose this album as one of Clapton's best because without blues music there would be no rock, and without really good blues music, it gives us nothing to compare the impersonaters with<br />So al-in-all, if you like blues music, I mean REAL blues music; this is the CD to pick up.
B000002JKS|3.0|This one I was excited to buy, as it came out straight after the beautiful Honeydrippers album. I am proud of Plant for trying to reinvent himself and making a modern sound out of Zep.  But only Little by Little and Sixes and Sevens are instant classics.
0553212478|5.0|I believe at the time that this was written, that readers were expected to come away from reading this book with a sense that people should not try to emulate God by creating their own life from scratch. And in such, readers were supposed to empathasize with the monster and shun the doctor. I had the opposite reaction. Initially I had pity for the monster but it slowly disolved as the story wore on. I felt pity for the doctor. I think this is one of the classic stories of good versus evil. And the fact that the interpretation of who is good and who is evil is up to each individual reader. And it's because of this that this is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend it.
B000002JK4|5.0|This one I bought a few months after it came out. But, it grew on me, and now Big Log is my classical song, the song of the songs.
B000002AGN|5.0|I have come to jazz from the blues, so for the past 20 years I have been listening to Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Johnny Hodges, Armstrong, Coltrane, Miles Davis, and many others who have given me some of that blues feeling.<br />The Dave Brubeck quartet is playing another &quot;feeling&quot;. Aside from &quot;Three to get Ready&quot;, which is closer to European music than to jazz, all tracks on this CD are definately within what I consider the Jazz Idiom. Even when playing the blues on Blue Rondo, Paul Desmond does not even remotely resemble Lou Donaldson, Jackie McLean and other blues inspired alto jazzmen.<br />While I will never stop listening to blues inspired jazz, I enjoy discovering other directions, other sounds. To me the music on TIME OUT is great for its sound and mood, as well as the introduction of &quot;Other&quot; rhythms. I found the improvisation on the 5/4 meter a little undaring, probably because Desmond did not feel these rhythms as well as he did the 4/4 and 6/4 ones. This is understandable since the 5/4 is not part of American cultural heritage, and improvising requires total absorbtion of rhythm before anything else.<br />There are beautiful moments on every track, and the &quot;hits&quot; are not necessarilly the ones that attracted me most here.<br />This all time hit does not need me to recommand it. But I can add that it belongs in every jazz collection, even one like mine, that is generally blues oriented.
B000002JNG|5.0|Ah, this one, is pure fire, it rocks and rocks and still rocks! Only Hurting Kind is a dated track, but all the others are masterpieces, even if the lot-of-hair-hard-rock-attitude from the 80's is still present. A must have.
B00000064F|5.0|The cinematic instrumental, Introduction, opens this treasure trove of an album, and is followed by Hazey Jane II, a lilting dreamy pop number. At The Chime Of A City Clock has its jazzy moments with lovely sax, while One Of These Things First, with its lively piano, is the closest Drake comes to happiness. The wistful and spacious Hazey Jane I is followed by the title track, an elegant breezy instrumental, and the sublime Fly. This version, with its fuller instrumentation, is my top favorite Nick Drake song, displaying the man at his best in its exquisite spirituality. Poor Boy is a jazzy/R&amp;B song with soulful backing vocals, while John Cale's celeste, piano and organ contributions on Northern Sky make this track a classic. Like two of his collaborators, Richard Thompson and Cale, Nick had his own poetic voice from the beginning, and his legacy is being rediscovered by a new generation of musicians. This album is the perfect entry point to investigate Drake's magic. So many styles, but so coherent. Bryter Layter's variety, sympathetic production and breathtakingly beautiful songs make it my favorite by this gifted artist.
B000002I7R|4.0|I first bought it  just when it came out, back in 82. How excited I was... And how worth the waiting was! Slow Dancer and Moonlight in Samosa were what I was expecting from Plant, a logical step of what Zep would be after In Through the Out Door.

B0000648WZ|4.0|.... and nobody does it better than Paul Verhoeven. This movie eats up Star Wars alive and spits out the pieces, with better special effects, more engaging (if superficial) characters, more deliriously paced action, and best of all, not one speck of self-important pseudo philosophy.<br />Set in a typically wholesome fascist society of the future, children learn all throughout school that, first and foremost, military service means citizenship. Johnny Rico and his buddies anxiously plunge headfirst into enlistment, little realizing that what lies ahead are divided pathways, conflicting values, class distinctions, unavoidable war and LOTS of explosions and loud music. Just as they start to question the course they've taken, their homeland is destroyed, and they are confronted by an inevitable battle with ruthless, screeching, oversized and extrememly unfriendly insectile aliens. The largest of these critters shoots fiery plasma out of its butt, capable of immolating orbiting starships and knocking dormant asteroids into the earth. It's up to our brave citizens-to-be to stand up to these bastardly bugs on their very planet, cripple them at their source and destroy the threat for good. Are you doing YOUR part???<br />Okay, so it's just a big gooshy noisy cartoon. This film is at least very blatant and honest about its lack of pretense, and still manages a very fulfilling two hours of no holds barred entertainment. You get it all ..... romance, conflict, explosions, entrails, nudity, sex, Jake Busey's sneering, Michael Ironside's glaring, Dina Meyer's endowments, and seamless digital wizardry, both in space and down in the dirt. This is one of the least boring movies ever made, and even the dumb parts are fun because you know it was done on purpose. A top ten guilty pleasure this viewer can never seem to tire of.
1577311523|1.0|The theme you heard many times \\"live in the present\\".This is great advice ,but for most people i would say almost all, not practical.How can some rate this book 5 stars when i am willing to bet very few will be changed to any great degree with this book .This information is as old as time itself and reveals nothing that is new.The problem with this and many other self help books is that word are just that if there is no practicality in application it is relatively useless.
B00005JKG9|5.0|The title of this review will make sense when you see the movie. Now, onto the show. In this particular year at the Academy Awards, both Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon were nominated; Pacino for best supporting actor, and Lemmon for best actor. But Pacino was also nominated in the best actor category for &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, which is not only a far inferior film, but a far inferior performance to the once that he gives in this film. So, what they should have done was give Lemmon the best actor nod and given the other little statue to Pacino for this film instead of the other one. But that will go down in the books as another classic Oscar blunder (like giving the top 5 awards to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and not even nominating &quot;Glory&quot; for a best picture oscar in 1989). Ok, off my soapbox and into the movie. For those of us who have had the joy to explore the many works of David Mamet as a playwright, this movie is a wet dream. Not only do the actors understand the particular cadence of Mamet's dialogue, they also understand the language itself. For many actors, Mamet is a language all its own, and if done badly, can result in horror. But in James Foley's superb direction, the bringing of Mamet's words from the stage to the screen seems effortless. The film still has all of the sweaty paranoia and claustrophobia of the stage play and with an added bonus: Alec Baldwin, in possibly the greatest short supporting role of all time, as Blake, the man who has been sent to the office &quot;on a mission of mercy!&quot; His monologue is unforgettable. It sets the tone for the entire film. It is shocking, hilarious, direct, abusive, ascerbic, acidic, spiteful, rageful, pompous and hateful. Many of these actors put in the best performances of their careers, like Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, and Ed Harris. Pacino is fantastic; the ultimate salesman as Ricky Roma, a suave smooth-talking, silver-tongued, sharp-dressed wheeler-dealer who could sell a stranger in a bar thousands of dollars of land after having only a few drinks with him. Kevin Spacey is pitch-perfect as the wimpy &quot;company man&quot; Williamson; a man whose whole life seems to be based around the success of others. I have to take a moment to thank the movie gods for assembling a cast of this magnitude, giving them the perfect roles to dive into head-first and staying true to the rhythms of Mamet's dialogue which is always more important than what the story is about anyways. Jack, I'll miss you. You will always be The Machine.bar thousands of dollars of land after having only a few drinks with him.

1577311523|1.0|The theme you heard many times \\"live in the present\\".This is great advice ,but for most people i would say almost all, not practical.How can some rate this book 5 stars when i am willing to bet very few will be changed to any great degree with this book .This information is as old as time itself and reveals nothing that is new.The problem with this and many other self help books is that word are just that if there is no practicality in application it is relatively useless.
0385508417|5.0|It's got it all -- laughter and tears.  Grisham captured life as most of us in America know it.  A wonderfully fun book and an easy read.  It will be a favorite at our house for many Christmases to come.
B00006RU5B|1.0|So, here we have it.  The worst elements of two bands watered down and limply performed for the sole purpose of selling records, which it will, but not if I can help it.  This [stinks], really [stinks].  There is nothing good about this record.  Every song is slow and painfully drawn out with no surprises to be had.  There are quite a few guitar solos featured on this disc which are utterly laughable in there simplicity.  Any kid with a guitar could have done the same thing.  For those of you who are familar with the Rage stuff you will be amazed that these plodding, pointless tunes are the best these guys could come up with.  [Heck], even the song titles are uninspired, \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"Exploder\\", \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\", etc., give me a break.  While the collaboration of these veterans sounded lame on premise the results put to tape and released by the money hungry folks at Epic AND Interscope are ridiculous.  This whole thing should have been aborted after the first 30 minutes of practice together.  But no, they stuck together and spent years, really YEARS on this junk. If you happen to come across a copy of this the lyrics (all by Chris Cornell), are good for a chuckle.  They read like an angst ridden 7th grader's poetry notebook and are full of vague references to creative topics like the sun, highways, setting things on fire and Jesus.  Oh yeah, all the artwork is as bad as the music.  It's really too bad that a -5 isn't available for these reviews because that's where Audioslave belongs.
B00006X06U|5.0|This is an epic and astonishing work. This is not merely a rehash of old material, but a song cycle made up of startling and revelatory interpretations of familiar and less-familiar songs in Mitchell's songwriting canon. It's an overwhelming experience, that demands your attention. This is not casual listening. The album takes the naked emotionalism established with her recent interpretations of \\"Both Sides Now\\" and \\"A Case of You\\" on the last collection, to new heights. Special note should be given to Vince Mendoza's expressive and cinematic orchestral arrangements. It has been said this is the last recording for Joni Mitchell -- whether that is true or not -- it has the feeling of a summation, yet despite its inherent nostalgia, points towards the future and hope of great and lasting music. A landmark album for Joni Mitchell, and one to measure all others for the ages.
B000069AUI|5.0|This a a great Cd, I received both Coldplay's Cds for my birthday and I can't believe I didn't get the first Cd sooner. The best Track I believe on this album is Clocks....how can anyone not love this song? This Cd is breathtaking. Yes, I do normally listen to Punk music and Rock music but this is the odd man out, along with Travis, Radiohead, John Mayer and DMB...Okay I take back the punk/rock music statement. I listen to Punk, Rock, and alternative...
B000059XY5|2.0|People all over complain that Joel Schumacher killed the Batman franchise. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that kept that Bat-series alive was the huge amounts of cash it raked in (Batman was the highest-grossing superhero film of all-time until they released Spider-Man). From the very beginning, the movies were a disgrace to the original comic book (which to this day I am still a devoted fan of). First of all, people accept without question that Michael Keaton is the best choice to play Batman. I'm thinking... no! Michael Keaton is a bad actor, and, despite popular belief (although I love Jack Nicholson), Jack was not right for the role. He was a good villain, but a bad Joker. Anyway, off to THIS movie. Everything that was wrong with the first film is still here. Poor casting (the only one they ever got right was Alfred), bad script, mangled storylines, and everything. The mangled storyline is what I'm most concerned about here. And I bet you know whos. Oh yeah, the Penguin. First off, he never was a mutant. Penguin was always just a nickname. Second, he never lived in a sewer. The Penguin is a crime-tycoon who lives in luxury, not some ...  . Third, he DEFINATELY, NEVER, EVER, ATE RAW FISH! People just can't understand! He is not a Penguin! That is his nickname! And killer penguins? Sheesh... But seriously? You would think in this case that it would be cheaper to stick with the storyline (since the wouldn't have to have all those extra set pieces, and they wouldn't have to bribe Bob kane to let them use it). But anyway, Danny DeVito does a good job, considering the... script-type thing, he has to work with. Also, they should have left out Max Schreck entirely. Just, no. Other than the silly script, the bad acting, and the mangled plot, this movie is fine. And the music and set design are so amazing, I was nice enough to give this poor excuse for a film an extra star. Anyway, I am simply ecstatic that the Batman movie franchise is being rebooted! SOMEONE ATWB FINALLY CAME TO THEIR SENSES AND PULLED THEIR HEAD OUT OF THEIR ...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I must say, that this is one of the best albums that I've ever listened to. Words can not describe how great it is. You'll just have to listen for yourself. Don't let the title of the cd or her latest single \\"Dirrty\\" throw you off. \\"Dirrty\\" is much, much more different than the other songs on the album. Nothing comes close to it. Also, the title Stripped is not meant to be dirty. It's about the album, and how it's stripped of all the glam and glitz, and you get to know the real her. That could not be more true. Now on to my review of the songs. The album starts off with Stripped Pt.1, which is a little intro that basically states the meaning of Stripped. The next song \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is upbeat and somewhat of a woman anthem. It also features Lil Kim, and talks about why is it that a woman is called a slut when a man is \\"the man\\". I think you get what I'm saying. The next song \\"Walk Away\\" is a ballad that is so beautiful. It's about how she can't get away from something that's bad for her. The next song \\"Fighter\\" is another anthem about how all the bad things have made her stronger. It's got an upbeat tempo and also features Dave Navarro on guitar, which adds a nice touch to it. The next track is an interlude for \\"Infatuation\\", and she speaks in spanish the whole time. It sounds good too. The next track is \\"Infatuation\\" which she debuted live at the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's about how the latin lovers will sweep you off your feet. The next track is an interlude for \\"Loving Me For Me\\", and she talks about how a man loves her for her, without all the fame and makeup on. The next track \\"Loving Me For Me\\" is basically what she talks about on the interlude. The next song is \\"Impossible\\" which was produced by Alicia Keys and she also sings backup on it. Great song! The next track is called \\"Underappreciated\\" and I think it's pretty much self-explanatory. The next song \\"Beautiful\\" is just that: beautiful. It's an anthem to feel good about yourself and to not let people decide how you feel about yourself. Very empowering! The next song \\"Make Over\\" was produced by Linda Perry, and it's kind of odd. Christina and Linda actually shout during the chorus, and although it's different, it's another good song. The next song \\"Cruz\\" is just her about being happy. \\"Soar\\" is another ballad which has some choir to it. It's probably my favorite song on the whole album. \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is just about casual sex, to put it bluntly. \\"Dirrty\\" is the next track, which I will again say is nothing like the rest of the album, so don't judge the album just based on that song. \\"Stripped Pt.2\\" is a continuation of part 1 and it goes on about the Stripped thing again. The next song \\"A Voice Within\\" is about listening to your voice within and not giving up on your dreams. The next song \\"I'm OK\\" is about her father's abuse in the home. It's not really manufactured which gives it a raw edge, and it also is real. You can hear her voice crack from the emotion. Very powerful! The last song is \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" which is very good. There is a choir and it has a gospel feel to it kind of. So that's my review. Please go out and buy the album. It's so awesome! 20 songs, 4 of which are interlude things, and Christina showcases her voice so well. There are so many different genres and it's just so great! Go buy it now!

B000063S6Z|5.0|Yes, this album is very similiar to his 1999 masterpiece \\"Play\\". But why is that a problem? It's still unique. Have you heard ANYBODY else do what moby's doing now? No. I think the problem that most fans have is that he has repeated a formula; something he has never done before. Most of his albums are complete changes from his last. \\"Animal Rights\\" sounds nothing like \\"Everything Is Wrong\\". As moby has said in an interview, \\"for this album, i feel that i don't have to jump up and down to get people's attention... 'i can write what i want'\\". <BR>The songs are well written and well played. He is an excellent piano, keyboard, guitar, bass and drum player. He's alost great at programming and dj'ing....<BR>Moby- do what you want. Don't care about always changing your image. I love this work. Keep up the great job.
0060930187|4.0|&quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; a classic novel by Sylvia Plath, describes the dark depressed world of Esther Greenwood through her battles with depression, which paralleled the author's in many cases.  The novel is semi-autobiographical and includes Plath's harrowing experience with an attempt at suicide.  <BR>    The story begins with Esther and eleven other girls in a New York city hotel room, all winners of an internship from a fashion magazine contest.  It follows her through a variety of adventures as she slowly sinks deeper and deeper into depression.  The slow demise of Esther's mind is shown and explained in her attempt at suicide to her experiences in a rehabilitation center and is made to seem almost, but not completely rational and understandable to the reader.<BR>    &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a compelling and engrossing book that will keep the readers eyes glued to the page until the abrupt ending.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I purchased this box set only because I missed the HBO series, and boy was it worth it! Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg put together an excellent cast of actors to portray the hardships the men of EASY Company 506 PIR had to endure. Though brutal in their fight for our freedom, I'm sure glad these guys were on our side. A must see for any fan of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". Remember the next time you're in the company of a veteran, take a moment to thank them for all they did for us, and to keep freedom and liberty a way of life for all americans!!
6302529867|5.0|This is not so much a story about mountaineering as it is about personal transformations and the bonds of friendships.  It's a very personal story driven by characters and very playlike as was pointed out to me.  Sure enough, if you read the credits, you will discover that this was a play.   <br />It's a hidden gem. I recommend it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rage against the Machine's TOM MORELLO, BRAD WILK AND TIM team up with former SoundGarden frontman Chris Cornell to make the best hard rock experience of the year! Take the rockin' riffs from ladder rage albums and mix em with the skyrocket vocals from SoundGarden and you have what is to be one of the finest sounding groups in years. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF RAGE OR THE GARDEN!
B000068CNX|5.0|All the Friends DVDs that came out have really been a gift to all their fans! If you really are a true Friends fan, you will buy this DVD. Getting to watch the episodes in the order that they were meant to be seen is a real treat. There isn't always time to catch the episodes on TV!! With this DVD, Friends is always there and you can watch it as much as you want. I am anxiously waiting for all the other seasons to release on DVD. I can't get enough of Friends!! I love this DVD, and the first season DVD, and the Best of Friends Collection DVDs!! BUY ALL OF THEM!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is the best album of the new millenium. It is head and shoulders above any form of of &quot;music&quot; since the separation of soundgarden and rage against the machine
B00007G207|5.0|This movie is the director's cut that Miramax Chief Harvey Weinstein chopped down into the US theatrical cut with which most American audiences are most familiar. The \\"new version\\" adds in extra bits here and there throughout the movie, but the most noticeable change is in the third act, where Toto's adult life is given more screen time. The story takes a darker tone here than in the rest of the movie, but it does not diminish the power and beauty of the ending, which has remained intact. This DVD is highly recommended for fans of the movie.
0452281881|5.0|He nailed it! I know each and every character in this book. Matt Beaumont has done an amazing job at bring the exciting, sometimes scary, always interesting world of an ad agency to life. As a copywriter, I totally related to all of the whining, the bickering, the back-stabbing and the gossip that went on at Miller Shanks. While the email format takes some time to get used to, it is well worth the effort. This book is entertaining enough for anyone to read. But if you work in an ad agency it's downright scary how on-target Mr. Beaumont is. You will finish this in one sitting. Must go now: the circus that is Miller Shanks is right outside my door.
B00004Z459|1.0|I am afraid to admit that at one time, i liked this album (in fact, if you check my other reviews, you'll see that I also liked other nu metal like korn and RATM). However, I have descended into the realm of REAL metal, and looking back, I laugh at how pitiful linkin park is. Quality of the band aside, it is practical common sense NOT to buy this album. First of all, its only like 35 minutes long, 12 songs, and pretty much half of this album can be heard whenever you turn on the radio or MTV. Now, onto the musicianship. The decision to carry two vocalists was obviously one that linkin park made without realizing how stupid it was. Think about it, since only usually one \\"sings\\" at a time, all the other does is just stand there and walk around at live shows. Damn it, at least put a bass in one of their hands (the band has no bass player, HA!) so at least theyre doing something rather than look like an idiot. As for the music itself, I can only stand so much of D minor without a SINGLE KEY CHANGE! Yes, linkin park are true innovators of tuning down their guitars and plyaing D minor. The drumming is quite exceptional--for a 5 piece set. Seriously, the band's dumb drummer is a millionaire, but all he intends to use is his hihat, snare, crash, and single pedal, yet he thinks it's enough to provide the full metal assault. YEAH RIGHT! Moving on, the guitars are boring (no solos at all), there is no bass, and the samples are just an attempt to make the band happy with ghetto folk and sell more albums. All the descriptions previous reviewers have described for this band can be found in much better places. For example, if you want skilled musicianship, check out Yngwie J Malmsteen. If you want intense metal, look no further than slayer. If you want intense music with skilled musicianship and much more melody and emotion, commit yourself to CRADLE OF FILTH and the black metal gods of the underworld!!!
0345347951|5.0|What more can I say? Epic in scope, beautifully written, interesting throughout ... Clarke is just the best. I would rather read bad Arthur Clarke, where little happens, and the plot is hackneyed than good stuff from someone else. The guy just knows how to write. And this is one of his best, if not the best. I wish they'd make a movie of it now that the technology to do so exists.
0743201140|5.0|I love this book because it simplifys the mysteries of what a strength is and how important it is to honor and value who we are.  Self-awareness is the foundation to a happy, successful life with self-esteem intact.  Everyone will benefit from reading this book and participating in the strengths-finder assessment.  This is what I am recommending to everyone regardless of what they think they know about themselves.  I am buying it as gifts for everyone.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Rarely does an album (if we're still allowed to call it that) come at you with great song after great song.  By way of explanation, my idea of a great song is one that sticks in your mind and you find yourself humming riffs and choruses before you go to sleep and when you wake up, when you're in the car, at the store, at work, pretty much anywhere.  On Ragpickers Dream, all 12 songs fit that definition of great.  All of them stick in your brain and won't leave. All of them could carry the record by themselves. Wow.
B000066NW0|5.0|I found avril before she was popular with her hit song complicated. And i was not suprised how fast she caught on.  I like Avril for her music. She is not like brittnay spears who only sells becuase of her trashy dress habits and sexy songs. Avril is a true singer with a all right voice and some great songs.  She may not be popular forever but her songs are fun and enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this album for anybody that loves some good rock-pop-punk music.
B00006IUL7|3.0|Not what I expected from a wonderful cast, and a good movie trailer.  This movie was slow and painstakingly \\"get to the point\\"!  Ok, there were two aspects I can say I liked.  First is the setting--Alaska.  Not your typical place for a movie, and that combined with the 24 hours of light that the movie portrayed is quite interesting.  The other thing is Robin Williams.  He's terrific.  Whenever he leaves behind the comedy and is just your bare bones actor he never disappoints, and he won't here.  I love seeing him in strong, non-comedic roles, it just shows his wonderful range and the broad spectrum of his abilities.  But that's all the good I can say about this movie.  Al Pacino is tired, and I'm not sure that was just his acting for the movie.  Pacino is terrific in so much, I wonder what happened here, and Hilary Swank is just there.  She plays a cop who is uncovering Al Pacino's character and is ho-hum in doing so.  So I suggest this movie only for Williams' performance, if you can make it through the muck of the whole picture.  I am rather disappointed that Insomnia wasn't better, I had such high hopes going in.
0060523794|5.0|This is by far one of the best business books I have read in a very long time. I had been waiting for this book for some time  and picked it up the day it came in. One reason was that I really wanted to know about the IBM turnaround. Second was that I wanted to know more about the slightly elusive Mr. Gerstner about whom media never has too much to write, unlike some other CEOs who anyway never tire of talking about themselves.<br />In simple words, this book is outstanding on both counts. Very well written, has the right amount of depth, provides excellent view of what happened at IBM and also the rationale behind Mr. Gerstners actions. There are good amounts of humour and emotional stuff also. <br />I would recommend this book to all. And congratulations to Mr. Gerstner for having a dream career and then polishing it off with a superbly written book about his crowning glory.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best &quot;true&quot; war docu/movie I have ever seen. One for the ages. I didnt have HBO when it was first shown, so I had to wait for the DVD. It was worth the wait. Some people have made the comparison with Saving Private Ryan. To be truthful, &quot;Ryan&quot; had a weak story line, if it were'nt for the amazing battle scenes, it would have been a flop. Anyway, this is far superior, and the most amazing thing is that, this is a &quot;true&quot; story. These guys were truly brave souls and we certainly owe them our freedom, so, the next time one of these old guys is driving 20 miles per hour on the road, and you blow your horn, just remeber it was that generation that you owe your freedom to. <BR>DVD Features DTS and DD5.1 surround and 16:9 widescreen format, so you see the film in its original format is great. <BR>Just one gripe..not with the movie itself but with the timing of the documentry &quot;we stand alone together&quot; They should have put this on the very first disk. When you see the &quot;real&quot; men, it gives you a greater appreciation of what they did. I am in awe..
B00005JKOV|1.0|I couldn't stomach my way through the whole film, the \\"speeches\\" in this sound like they were written by someone who got a hold of an intro to philosophy text and skimmed the chapters.<br />To those who enjoyed this film for its \\"intellectual\\" merits: Go read some good books!!!! The ideas 'discussed' in this film have been around for a long, long time, and have been expressed much clearer. A lot of this is just 'pop-philosophy' gone berserk.<br />It IS interesting visually: I agree with one reviewer who said this would have made a good 15 minute short film, that would have done the trick.<br />It depresses me that so many people were impressed by the content; it just demonstrates to me how uneducated people are. Anyone who didn't sleep through their humanities coures in college would find this film sophmoric, pretentious, muddled, and ultimately insulting to the viewers' intelligence.<br />Again, to found this thought-provoking, Fantastic!! Now just take the next step and go read some books written by educated, intelligent people with things to say!
0684803356|1.0|Simply put, this book, and Hemmingway in general, is overrated. There is nothing unexpected in the prose nor storyline, just a typical page-turner or \\"best seller\\" -- and that is *not* a compliment! Lacking in any real insight and imagination, Hemmingway is more like a modern-day Stephen King or Amy Tan or any other writer who sells their soul for the sake of popularity.
0395389496|5.0|I have to say that out of all of the Christmas books I have read this is possibly my favorite. I really enjoy illustrations and the story. I am in my teenage years and I really love this story. Everyone should read this book.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Having never played the video game, I thought this movie was pretty good and stood on its own.  With an interesting storyline and some rather innovative twists, Resident Evil is fun--now I want to play the game.  Jovovich stars as a cop/heroine who gets mixed up in the whole \\"zombies taking over the world\\" thing.  But she has amensia and doesn't remember she's a cop, or what she was doing before it all started.  My favorite scene is in the tunnel of lasers where everyone was sure to met their demise.  It is fun and graphic and there's a few laughs thrown in, and overall Resident Evil is a good Friday night movie that will give you bang for your buck.
6304539487|2.0|Plot: It's the future, there's android machine people, and the story follows a cop who's an android. The humans get body parts replaced, even their brains, but they have a &quot;ghost&quot; which seems to be what makes them &quot;human&quot;. Deals with a theme of what makes us human. (It was hard to follow, that's what I could gather from it.)<br />My thoughts: The plot was very hard to follow, the dub of the main character's voice is horrible, didn't give me any care for what happens to the characters. I watched the first half, with no desire to watch the second. The animation itself was good, which is what gives it the 2 stars.
0688172377|5.0|This book has opened up a whole new world to me.  I have read both of Waris's books.  There are ways of life and cultures that I have never heard of before.  This woman had an amazing struggle just to live.  The pain of FGM when she was 5, Having to run away beacause your father wanted to sell you into marriage for 3 camels!  This is real, people live like this.  Waris went from being a desert nomad to being a model in the western world.  Talk about culture shock.  Hers is an incredibe story about life and love and the struggles we face.  After reading Her books I was so interested that I went on to read &quot;Do They Hear You When You Cry&quot;  and &quot;Western Dress Bound Feet&quot;  I became so incensed that I continued not only to read more about this type of subject matter, but I also joined Equality Now and am trying to inform my peers of situations other than where we live.  I would recommend this book and any like it to everyone and anyone.  Read about the world and learn
B00006M183|4.0|I must say, my first listening of the new Pearl Jam album was disappointing.  I guess I still expect, album after album, to hear Eddie Vedder break out the vocal styles common on \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\"  But, a few listens in, this album really grabbed me.  I guess I would sum up the difference between \\"new\\" Pearl Jam and \\"old\\" Pearl Jam in the following way: whereas Eddie Vedder was pissed and energetic on early albums, he is now pissed but depressed.  Therefore, the lyrics take a somewhat subdued tone, but the music really shines.  But, listen a few times, and the lyrics actually jump out in subtle ways.  This is a very effective, deep album, that needs to be appreciated at a more concious level than some of PJ's prior efforts.  Definite highlights include \\"Can't Keep\\" (trust me, give it a few spins), the immediately powerful \\"Save You,\\" (ok...I will skip ahead...the first several songs are very solid).  \\"Thumbing my Way\\" is an excellent acoustic song with emphasis on the vocals.  \\"You Are\\" also caught my ear early on, and continues to shine.  \\"Arc\\" answers the band's critics: can Eddie Vedder still use overpowering vocals?  Apparently, yes, although in a somewhat humorous fashion.  This is definitely one of the good surprises of the year, along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' new album (and opposite of Our Lady Peace's terrible commercial effort).  I highly recommend a purchase- Pearl Jam is the greatest rock band of our time, and their music is deeply rewarding, going further than the shallow pop melodies of much lesser bands.
B00005YXZH|5.0|but so what.  Here's my simple litmus test:  I keep putting this CD on, month after month.  I've bought a lot of enjoyable stuff in that time period and listened to all of it more than once, but I keep coming back to this album.  When I haven't listened to it in awhile, I catch myself humming one of the songs, maybe singing a few words from &quot;Reservations&quot; or something.  This is by far my favorite Wilco album, but it is more than that.  In a collection of 500-600 CDs, this one has methodically worked its way up to the top of my list as one of the best CDs I own.  No joke.
B00000255X|2.0|This is not Dylan's best, this is clearly one of his worst works ever!
B00005JG6R|3.0|Plot: Tetsuo, a member of a biker gang in 2019 Neo-Tokyo, meets these children who have psychic abilities which awakens his own psychic and physical powers, but will he be good or be a monster? &quot;Akira&quot; is one of the children with psychic abilities who is rarely seen, and who might cause the end of the world.<br />My thoughts: Weird, just plain weird. The plot is rather hard to follow, but there's cool action sequences, great animation and one very funny scene with a giant teddy bear that I'll never forget. If I was rating based on animation alone it would have 5 stars, but taking into account the whole movie (plot, characters, etc) I can only give it 3. Even so, it's still a must see for anime fans because of the animation and the impact it had on anime. <br />When I first saw Akira the only other anime I'd seen had been Sailor Moon on weekday morning TV. If you've only seen a few anime shows and they're all like Sailor Moon, I wouldn't recommend Akira as a first step into darker/drama/weird/thinking anime. If you're already into darker/drama/weird/thinking anime then you'd probably love Akira.<br />Definitely not for anyone under 13, I might go so far as to say 16 and up (it's a bit disturbing).
B00000DC10|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums of this decade. This completely redefines punk as a genre. It seems most punk bands out there all sound similar and arn't really interested in creating anything revolutionary... isn't that what punk is supposed to be about? The technical brilliance of this CD makes me wonder why it wasn't more widely noticed. It's practically the only thing that makes me still believe in punk as a genre... you owe it to yourself to check out this CD. you have to listen to it all though, this is one of the albums that absolutely must be experienced as a whole.
B00006LIRI|4.0|A great history of one of the worlds top rock bands ever.  I have to agree with a previous reviewers track listing, from a fans perspective.  I do feel that the entries from &quot;Pop&quot; should have been left alone.  Those songs (and the whole album) sound amazing!!
B00006M183|5.0|...The album is very down to earth.  Both lyrically and musically the album is not just relevant, but cutting edge.  Get your hands on it whatever way you can, listen to it, resist temptation to compare it to what's \\"good\\" according to your radio announcer.  Then when you realize how amazing it is, just buy it.  It's [X] well spent and you get some incredible artwork and a lyric book that actually took time and creativity to make.  All in all an amazing album!
B00003OO3O|5.0|Amazing. Schenker is simply the best. I'm so sorry that he was such a volatible guy, and his troubled work relantionship with Phil Mogg was responsible for him exiting the band, thus ending the best (and only worthwhile) period in UFO's career.<br />With FORCE IT, the second of the four now considered classic albums, producer Ron Nevison began to focus the band a little bit more. The result is a strong, full hard rock album, where even the ballad HIGH FLYER has Schenker doing one of his best slow and melodic solos ever!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B00006LLNV|5.0|This CD has a lot of mexican chants this CD has lots of relaxing sonds too
B00003CXI1|5.0|My mom bought me this movie thanks to being a very big HP fan.  The only complaint I have about it...not long enough!! I was disappointed when it was over!<br />I saw it twice in the theater and watch it over and over again thanks to having it on DVD.  Love it &amp; love all the characters in the movie..they look just like I imagined!
0446678430|3.0|Not a lot of nutritous or fulfilling substance, but it does get you pumped up pretty good.  I agree with other reviewers that the book is short on specifics.  To be fair, however, Kiyosaki never claimed that this book would have a lot of specifics.<br />On the up side, however, I felt very motivated after reading this book, and, came away with some general ideas.<br />I can't help but wonder two things, however:<BR>1.  Is this book simply written so vaguely that you make out of it what you will?<br />2.  Was &quot;Rich Dad&quot; omniscient and ominpresent?  It's amazing how many fables, fairytales, bible stories and diagrams he seemed to teach for every occasion.  Just a thought--you draw your own conclusion
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt accomplishes the rare feat of turning out a memoir that is both incredilby moving as well as entertaining.  The vivid images portrayed by McCourt as he recounts his childhood in Limerick will make you seem like you are living the experiences yourself.  You see the landscape, smell the smells, feel the air, hear the sounds.  You will find yourself laughing out loud one minute and reaching for a Kleenex to wipe your tears the next.  McCourt is a true talent.
B00006LSM3|5.0|It's been about 15 years since George Harrison has put out a solo album, and nothing could be more eagerly anticipated than this posthumous release - and rightfully so. The 12 Brainwashed tracks that represent the work Harrison was doing over the last few years of his life are melodic, beautiful and fun. \\"Any Road\\" starts the album off on a Traveling Wilburys note - the song is bright and bouncy, and Harrison sounds as healthy as ever. The standout tracks come a little later; \\"Looking for My Life\\", \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" are absolute masterpieces, with the latter two sounding as achingly beautiful as anything he did with the Beatles or on All Things Must Pass. The guitar playing stands as some of Harrison's best and most expressive work ... just watch out for \\"Marwa Blues\\" because the song will get you right in the throat. What I was struck by most as I listened to the lyrics is the wisdom this man was blessed with from the very beginning. The things he sung about hypothetically as a young, ex-Beatle came true here on his final release. A great album, by far the best any Beatle has done in a while.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Well this CD is just plain great.  That's all that really needs to be said, but I'll continue anyway.  Having the hard edge of Rage Against the Machine and the lyrical, musical, and vocal genious of Chris Cornell, Audioslave is just amazing.  All the the things I love about Chris Cornell are are their best, and all the things I loath about RAtM have given way to what I consider better music.  These guys have a real chemisty together.  The performances are tight and creative, but still hard and mainstream enough to satisfy RAtM fans.  Especially including Chris Cornell, who is without doubt one of the best rock singers/writers of the past 15 years.  If you think you might like this album at all, it'll be better than you imagined.  I don't recommend you drive while you listen to it, someone might get hurt.  Ok that was a lil' joke.
B00006LSM3|3.0|A fitting ending for a famously uneven solo career, Brainwashed is a nice improvement over the majority of George's releases following the majestic All Things Must Pass. Most of the tunes are acoustic guitar driven, with George's trademark electric slide woven throughout. True to his word, producer Jeff Lynne kept the production simple, thankfully without his ELO  signature sound that was so apparent on Cloud Nine. The guitar playing is well up in the mix, and George's playing at times is beyond what many probably thought his fretwork limitations were. Though George's voice sound a bit worn (which is understandable) it has aged well and fits the material to a tee. The lyrics are George wearing his thoughts and visions on his sleeve with a bit of venom here and a bit of humor there and a lot of resolution throughout. Pisces Fish, Looking for My Life and Stuck Inside a Cloud rank with some of his finest solo pieces. Marwa Blues is a stunning instrumental piece, laid back and peaceful. Overall, worth the wait. Sadly, our last wait for a George recording.
0688145078|4.0|I give this book (and its companion, \\"I'm A Big Sister\\") to every family I know who is about to have a new baby arrive. It has proven to be excellent in preparing a young child for the arrival of a sibling. I only have one gripe - the assumption of one manner of feeding. It would be much better written to have both options alluded to, as in, \\"Babies need milk.\\" (which is in the text) with a picture of baby nursing along with a picture of Daddy or big sibling giving a bottle. Then each family could adapt it to their situation. I am glad, however, that the bottle-feeding illustration shows the Daddy giving the bottle, which does happen in some breast-feeding families. Would love a revision to include both situations, however! All in all, a WONDERFUL book!
0671775308|4.0|This is a great motivating book.  It makes you want to get into action and learn how to budget budget budget!  It speaks of the people next door who you would never know were rich because they spend below their means.  That's the key!  Invest, save, and most of all don't spoil your kids...hee hee. <BR>     The downfall of this book is it is a bit repetitive.  They tend to dwell when you want to learn how to do it!  This book does not teach you how to invest or how to budget.  It's a great book to get you motivated and to start learning how to do these things.  Basically, it comes down to getting together w/ your accountant.<BR>     So, for a starter book it's great!  But, don't expect to know exactly what to do when you are done reading it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|My son is 2 and loves the movie. I love the movie and my husband loves the movie. What's there not ot love : )
0312932081|5.0|I love all Orson Scott Card but this one holds a special place in my heart. Ender's Game is one of those books that is extremely life changing. I read it as an adolescent and I think this is the best time to read this book to truly empathize with a displaced, estranged child. This science fiction book is perfect for both the sci fi lover and those who never touch the stuff. The book is really about Ender and his struggles in adjusting as a small boy with a big mind in a cruel place. It avoids some of the tiring technical information that you find in many other science fiction books. A great read!

0060920084|2.0|So a guy takes a trip around America and finds something wrong with our country at every turn.  He doesn't believe in God, hates all Republicans (especially Reagan) and disrespects war heroes like Eisenhower.  If he hates America so much maybe he should move to another country.  Oh wait, he did that.  He just came back here to write this book and make some money.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I saw her in concert, when she opened for Dave Matthews Band. She rocked I loved her voice and that she's so real about it.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Just wanted to say that George's final album is fantastic and classic George.  All the tracks sound reminiscent of Traveling Wildbury's and Cloud 9 tracks.  Marwa Blues, a nice little slide guitar jam/intrumental provoked some Beatle riffs and Any Road is a definite Wildbury's style track.  All in all, it was a fitting finale to George's career.  The tunes range from buoyant and poignant to honest testaments of the trials of life....Thanks for the music George.
B000004756|5.0|\\"The Guitar Trio\\" of Paco De Lucia, Al DiMeola, and John McLaughlin join together again to perform their magic again with this stunning album. Although it has the same premise as their \\"Friday Night Live In San Francisco\\", there are some big differences. One, it's not live, and two, twenty years have passed. Although it is missing a bit of that live energy, this is an incredible album.<br />The Trio work well together taking turns soloing over the tune. The liner notes are kind enough to tell which of the guitar virtuosos is taking the solo. On most of the tunes, they each take one solo. Not only do they share the solo work, the share the composition work each taking the pen to write several songs each. The playing moves from fast and furious, to slow and peaceful. The rhythms are almost all Latin with a flamenco feel to them. \\"Le Monastere Dans Les Montagnes\\" is a good representation of both of these feels. The song is sometimes quiet, and nearly passive, and then with a burst of finger, the notes leap out at you in a rapid fire pace. The album opens with a very flamenco sounding \\"La Estiba\\". Add in highlights like \\"Midsummer Night\\", \\"Manha De Carnaval\\" and \\"Espiritu\\" you can't go wrong with this album.<br />Once again, these three show the unique chemistry they have between them. It would have been interesting to see how this album faired if it was recorded live. These guys get better with each passing year, and I look forward to their next collaboration. This should definitely be added to your Trio collection.
0792842073|5.0|This movie takes a look at a death row inmate facing his last few days of life and how he comes to grips with the crime he committed.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn give riveting performances as the main characters in this film.  Penn stars as Matthew Poncelet, a man sentenced to die for committing two brutal murders.  Sarandon stars as Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun who begins corresponding with Poncelet and finally goes to the prison to meet him.  What she encounters is a hardened criminal who shows no remorse for his crimes, and even places blame on the system for locking him up, all the time claiming his innocence and insisting he was merely a bystander.  Prejean tries to break through Poncelet's thick exterior and help him realize that he is indeed responsible for his crimes and he should seek forgiveness, both from God and the victims' families.<br />I was struck by the way the film showed the change in Poncelet as his execution date neared.  Gone was the rough exterior, replaced by a person who has finally accepted his fate and his mistakes.  Prejean also grows to genuinely care for Poncelet, and he of her, as well.<br />Sarandon won an Academy Award as best actress for her role as Prejean, and Penn was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Poncelet.  This is a gripping, realistic drama about life on death row, and Penn and Sarandon make it seem very life-like.  I highly recommend this moving film.  You won't think about the death penalty the same way again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I happen to be a huge Mamet fan. &quot;House of Games&quot; is easily in my top ten of all time and I love &quot;The Spanish Prisoner.&quot; But Glengarry Glen Ross is the best of the bunch. I never cease to be amazed as I watch Jack Lemmon acting in this movie. Yes indeed --- he should have won an Oscar. You can feel his desperation. His scene at a prospective customer's house is a classic, as his his final scene with Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey as the impotent office manager, Alec Baldwin as the overbearing motivator, and Al Pacino as the all-star salesman are equally unbelievable. Some may be turned off by the profanity, but it fits for the circumstances in this movie. If you are tired of the current trend toward overblown movie special effects and want to see how dialogue can carry a movie, Glengarry Glen Ross is for you. Best line (among many) --- &quot;Coffee is for closers.&quot;
B0000028RR|5.0|The flawless combination of Zack de la Rocha's raging, politically-charged hip hop lyrics, Tom Morello's ingenious guitar techniques and riffs, and the backup of Timmy C. on bass and Brad Wilks on drums, is one that should never be underestimated.  Each and every track on this album is a perfect combination of these elements, there are no fillers whatsoever.  It seems nearly impossible to describe a similar band, although I like to think of Rage as an angry Chuck D. meets a modern Led Zeplin.  Zack's amazing rhymes will incourage every listener to educate themselves about political issues and social injustices in the world.  This is a rare trait in rock music today; the majority of lyrics consisting of the rantings and ravings of         <BR>high, high school drop-outs, of course well thought out lyrics are to be expected from a band whose guitarist is a Harvard grad and the son of a United Nations delegate.  I strongly recommend this album to fans of rap and rock alike, everyone can get something out of Rage's music.  I also recommend picking up a copy of Rage's other albums including 'Evil Empire', 'Live &amp; Rare', and some of their newer albums.
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour's new DVD is absolutely amazing.  The music is performed beautifully.  Even though there's not the flash and spectacle of the typical Pink Floyd concert, Dave proves that the music can hold its own.  I can't stop watching it.  You even get to see Rick Wright join in with the band for a couple of songs, something every Pink Floyd loves to see.  I especially enjoy the extras that come on the dvd.  They give fans a glimpse into the life of David Gilmour, something that He has usually kept to himself.  There are scenes of his house boat Astoria while he sings Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, and I think that is my favorite part of the dvd.  It's absolutely breathtaking.  The music, Dave's voice, and the scenery create an almost dream like experience.  I would urge any true music fan to buy this dvd.  It should be an essential item in everyone's dvd collection.  A must have.
0780622545|4.0|William Hurt, Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, and Jennifer Connelly star in this dark sci fi thriller.  Sewell stars as John Murdoch, a man who wakes up in a hotel room with no recollection of how he got there.  He also find out that he's a suspect in several prostitute murders.  Visions of &quot;The Strangers&quot;, beings who can stop time and alter reality, also haunt Murdoch's mind.  William Hurt stars as Inspector Frank Bumstead, a cop who is pursuing Murdoch and trying to figure out the riddle of &quot;The Strangers&quot; as well. Kiefer Sutherland and Jennifer Connelly give fine performances along the way.<br />I felt that this was a good , but not great movie.  I found the plot hard to follow at times, and the dark scenes made the viewing difficult.  I did enjoy the computer animation, and the acting is good throughout.  I would recommend this movie to sci fi and film noir fans.  It is worth watching.
B00006G8K0|5.0|There are many lengthy, detailed, and generally fine (positive) reviews here for the movie, one of my top-ten all-time favorite horror films, and justifiably lukewarm or negative reviews of the DVD itself (nice print, virtually no extras, shoddy packaging), so I won't reiterate them at length, but endorse the general consensus. Movie: Fantastic! DVD: Eh! The main piece of crucial info I wanted to add, that I didn't see anyone else mention here, is that the brief shots of spurting blood seen during the staking of Lucy ARE intact here. They had somehow been excised from Warners' previous VHS issue of Horror of Dracula, rendering that edition null and void for hardcore fans. Whether intentionally or through dumb luck (in Warners' case just as likely) the missing footage has been reinstated, so Hammer fans can relive the moment in digital clarity! Enjoy!
0316666343|1.0|I read the first few chapters and wasn't at all involved.  The 14 year old didn't seem like a 14 year old.  Heaven didn't seem like much of a heaven. Trying to give it a chance, I continued on.   Never did any of the characters touch me in any way...Never did I really care.  Never did I forget that I was reading a book and that it seemed to be tedious at that. ..Finally, 3/4 of the way thru I gave up and gave it away.<br />I want a novel to surround me, involve me.  I hate the feel of required reading and there was nothing here to make me feel otherwise.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovey Bones packs a powerful punch in the first chapter and keeps the reader engaged, reeling for more.  Immediately, the reader meets Susie Salmon who gets brutally murdered in the first chapter.  We then hear the tale through Susie's eyes from the comfort of her heaven.  The book made me ponder two questions: 1) Would the family or her friend Ruth find the killer and the key to the murder mystery?;  and 2) How did author Alice Sebold come up with such a clever and original way of telling a story?<br />I haven't been so engaged in a book since I read Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha a few years ago.  The Lovely Bones gives the reader the elements of suspense of an engaging murder mystery while making it the complex story of a family trying to survive the aftermath of tragedy.  Sebold has compelling and succinct prose.  And I would disagree with any review that argues that she tells without showing.  I had a complete picture of the town, her house, the cornfield and the characters.  I'll be interested to see what Sebold thinks of next.
0553801481|5.0|As others have pointed out this book is best read after the assasins/liveship triology.  Still a wickd read though (didn't want to finish it cos it was sooo good)
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Not only does this DVD include Special Features like...John Williams conducting the films original score during the film's premiere in May 2002, but it includes the new edition which Spielberg perfected, as if he really needed to. This DVD is a must have..with more special features than you have time to watch. Spielberg rules!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Please allow me to be one of the first thousand people to say, &quot;it's about time&quot;!  This film was sorely missing in action for so long I nearly gave up on it!  And I for one am glad they gave it a full-screen 1.33:1 treatment in addition to the letterboxed widescreen 2.35:1.  I mean, it's not like we are trying to squeeze 6 horses and a chariot into the frame in Glengarry Glen Ross, this film is an intense character study, and the closeups are so very necessary.  Many snobby dvd websites make remarks all the time like &quot;who watches fullscreen versions anyway?&quot; but a movie like this demands fullscreen--- in fact, if you compare the fullscreen and letterbox-widescreen of this movie, you will notice that the letterboxed version actually omits some top and bottom information, it is masked apparently just to satisfy the always-vocal widescreen TV owners!  Look at the Alec Baldwin scene and notice that his tie is not showing in closeups on the widescreen disc.  But look at the same frame on the dreaded &quot;fullscreen&quot; disc and you see the knot of his tie in all its corporate glory.  Fullscreen looks right.  I am one of the quiet millions who have normal sized televisions (in the 19&quot; to 32&quot; range) and I prefer the fullscreen versions to the widescreen every time---FILL THAT SCREEN!  <br />This Glengarry Glen Ross dvd looks great, the sound is very clean and clear, and if you can't understand a snippet of sales-dialogue, just a touch of the subtitle button fixes the situation.  The soundtrack to this film is exceptionally cool jazz, and sounds so much better than we were forced to endure on VHS for 10 long years.  The dvd menus also give you a bit more of this music to sample.  Two nice interview snippets from TV show Kevin Spacey doing the &quot;Go To Lunch&quot; scene with a nervous acting student, and Jack Lemmon talks about aging and getting the good roles.  There is a nice tribute to Jack Lemmon as well featuring his son, director James Foley, and actor Peter Gallagher mainly, and two sales-oriented seminars.  I would have liked to see the trailer for this film, but maybe there wasn't one... after all, this wasn't an FX-laden summer blockbuster, it was a Pulitzer Prize-winning play made into a film, and the movie stands on its own simply based on merit:  Taking into acount the acting, the script, the direction, and the music, there really is not a bad frame in the entire film!  This movie is a masterpiece.  Get yourself this dvd, put that coffee down, and enjoy!
0385505833|5.0|When a person wants some easy holiday reading, this is the book!<br />I read this last November and can't wait to read it again!  I have recommended it to all of my friends as a way to start the holiday season.  Nothing too heavy, but a nice story.  Great if you're short on time, but like a bit of a comical story with an uplifting ending!
B0000028TN|5.0|This Album is all I need to take a rest after a hard working day. It seems you are feeling the warm brazilian sun on your skin. The mix of jazz, funk, fusion and brazilian rhythmes takes you into a new dimension of music. What can I say more? Here it yourself!
B00006IUL2|4.0|What can I say?  I liked it.  The other reviewers seem to find this film a humiliation for Callas.  Well, maybe so.  But it was still lots of fun.  Yes, it is a little Ed Woodsy, but I think that's a part of the enjoyment.  Callas was obviously used to the great melodrama of opera, and certainly Medea is a role with lots of sturm und drang.  But still, I was moved by her grief at being cast aside (does anyone in the world NOT know the story without it being outlined here???).  I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of film, so to speak.
0805062971|5.0|While the film Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, was great- like most cases in which a book is made into a movie, the book is _better_.<br />Providing more context, more analogies, and a better view into Project Mayhem, this book surpasses the movie in almost every description and event. It's worth the read, and worth forking over the money to buy your own copy.<br />From the book:<br />\\"About my boss, Tyler tells me, if I'm really angry, I should go to the post office and fill out a change-of-address card and have all his mail forwarded to Rugby, North Dakota.<br />Another thing I could do, Tyler tells me, is I could drive to my boss's house some night and hook a hose to an outdoor spigot. Hook the hose to a hand pump, and I could inject the house plumbing with a change of industrial dye. Red or blue or green, and wait to see how my boss looks the next day. Or, I could just sit in the bushes and pump the hand pump until the plumbing was superpressurized to 110 psi. This way, when someone goes to flush the toilet, the toilet tank will explode. At 150 psi, if someone turns on the shower, the water pressure will blow off the shower head, strip the threads, blam, the shower head turns into a mortar shell.\\"<br />\\"Tyler asked what I was really fighting.<br />What Tyler says about the crap and the slaves of history, that's how I felt. I wanted to destroy something beautiful I'd never have. Burn the Amazon rain forests. Pump chlorofluorocarbons straight up to gobble the ozone. Open the dump valves on supertankers and uncap offshore oil wells. I wanted to kill all the fish I couldn't afford to eat, and smother the French beaches I'd never see.<br />I wanted the whole world to hit bottom.<br />Pounding that kid, I really wanted to put a bullet between the eyes of every endangered panda that wouldn't screw to save its species and every whale or dolphin that gave up and ran itself aground. \\"
B00006LSM3|5.0|When hearing about a LP from a person who dead not one year ago, one thinks its a rush job to cash in.<BR>Not with this jewel.

0316776963|4.0|Mostly a collection of short stories that build upon one another, David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a refreshing break from the novel format. I took this in with me to the gym to keep me company as I worked out on the treadmill and found myself laughing out loud. It only took me a few work outs to finish, and made the time pass easily.<br />Sedaris truly has a caustic wit. The rest of his books are next on my list.
B000003CMD|4.0|After the tragic death of guitarist Duane Allman, The Allman Brothers regrouped and came up with their most accesssible album up until that time.  Gone were the extended guitar workouts that had previously been their signature (indeed, the entire running length of \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" is barely longer than the half hour-plus song \\"Mountain Jam\\" from the preceeding album).  In their place came some terrific songwriting hooks and their most popular single, \\"Ramblin' Man,\\" which took its place alongside Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" as the twin towers of Southern rock anthems.<br />Other standout tracks include fine rockers \\"Wasted Words\\" and \\"Southbound,\\" as well as the gorgeous instrumental \\"Jessica.\\"  The band also keeps in touch with its roots with \\"Come and Go Blues\\" and the more traditional country sounding \\"Pony Boy.\\"  Only the short length (only 7 tracks) of the album keep it feeling somewhat slight and out of 5 star territory.<br />Overall, a fine recording that once and for all established Southern rock as a cultrual force.
0375703764|4.0|This is one of the few books that has ever creeped me out while reading it. It was a while back that I read House of Leaves, but the overall sense of the book tickling at some esoteric notion of existence still rings in my mind every time I look at it sitting quietly on my bookshelf. The story was sometimes bogged down by the abstract approach to the narrative, though I found it effectual and admire the book for it. Overall a wonderful work of philosophical fiction, I suggest it for those that like to think, ponder, that like head-trips.
B00005OAA6|5.0|The first post Spice Girl album I bought was Geri Halliwell's &quot;Schizophonic,&quot; which I still enjoy listening to every now and then.  Emma Bunton's (aka Baby Spice) voice never appealed to me, Mel C made a strong single debut, and Mel B should never have released anything post Spice Girl.<br />So I was understandably skittish about getting Victoria's solo offering, but after reading the reviews, I knew that I had to listen to it myself.  After just one spin, I realized something that probably no one realized while the Spice Girls were popular: Victoria can sing.  Granted, she doesn't have a strong voice, but neither does Janet Jackson, Natalie Imbruglia, Kylie Minogue, or many others not blessed with Mariah-esque vocals.<br />I especially love the following tracks;<BR>- &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot; - just really great!  the beat is danceable.<BR>- &quot;A Mind of It's Own&quot; - ballad-y and i think that it would've been a good single to release to the U.S.<BR>- &quot;That Kind Of Girl&quot; - another ballad-esque but it does show that she can sing.  <BR>- &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; - one of my most favorite songs!<BR>- &quot;Midnight Fantasy&quot; - just phenominal<br />I would write more about the tracks but they are ALL REALLY GREAT.  I think that Victoria would've greatly benefitted from exposure in the U.S. - this Spice Girl could've done what other's have failed to do - capture the U.S. market.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. What more can I say, everyone says the same thing I want to. Alo to the person who said there aren't any extras. Yes, on Disc 2 there are a ton of extras, try looking.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I heard the complete soundtrack and then went to the movie. You know what was funny? The only song i remeber actually being in the movie was Lose Yourself. Ill have to see it again. Lose Yourself is one of the best songs ive heard in a long time. Probably since MOP's - Ante Up. Chances are that this will be one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. And with good reason. Nas disses up Jay-Z hard on \\"Wanna be me\\" and Jay-z with Freeway shines on \\"8 miles and running\\". And how about rap veteran Rakim? and the inclusion of Ganagstarr. Of course there's all his label mates and newcomer 50 cent with his hit \\"wanksta\\". However what i found that stood out was Macy Grays track. She comes off better than Xzibit. Overall 8 mile if close, if not, the best hip-hop soundtrack that is in existance. Oh ya. And the movie is damn good too.
0553579908|5.0|Short and sweet, my review that is, not the book.  Never the less, all I can say is that Martin is currently, hands down the best alive today.  Don't wait for the softcover and don't be intimidated by the length or the number of characters.  If you can afford it get first editions, get them signed, and place them on the shelf never to be read.... for that you can do with the softcover editions you will buy.  Then you wait, for the next book and pray to whatever gods you love that both you and Martin live to finish this amazing, stunning saga.
B00005JJX8|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD since the format was introduced. Yes, it would have been great if Paramount had restored this candy. But the colors ARE nevertheless nice and rich, Grant is full of panache and Grace Kelly is simply scrumptious. In the words of Joe E Brown in  \\"Some Like it Hot\\"---YOWZA!  The supporting cast is great, but to me the real stars are the post-war beauty that was the Riviera, and the gallic life style--however romanticized it may be. I suspect this is a DVD release that would benefit from a 16:9, HDTV screening. A major advantage of seeing it on DVD is the obvious crispness and detail of both the foreground and, when it was convenient to Hitchcock, the backgrounds as well. Interior scenes benefit from the detail as the richness of the Rivera hotel and restaurant locations can be savored. Come to think of it, this may be one of Mr. Hitchcock's most sensual movies, emphasizing the tactile: you see the patient fondling of the jewels, the enjoyment of the food (\\"..it's a quiche lorraine...\\")and wine and, by implication, the treat represented by the lovely Miss Kelly (\\"...have you ever had a better offer?...One that guarantees satisfaction?\\") It may well be, as many viwers have said, that this is a \\"lighter\\" Hitchcock. It is by no means less enjoyable. Grab it (and devour it with a quiche and a glass of crisp white wine. A muscadet). Sixth star, anyone?
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I just recently recieved my copy of the 2002 widescreen collector's edition and it was wonderful. I hadn't seen this movie since I was 11 years old, so I didn't notice the changes right away, except for the extra scenes (which I LOVED) especially the scene with Elliot giving E.T a bath. As Steven Speilberg explains, it makes Elliot and E.T's day together longer, and gives them more opportunity to bond. This scene should never have been cut. For those of you who, like me, haven't seen this movie in years, I recommend watching \\"The making of E.T.\\" on the second disk, and then go ahead and watch the 2002 version, and see for yourself how great it looks AND sounds, with the digitally enhanced soundtrack. Speilberg explains what they did to improve certain scenes, with the advanced technology we have today.For example, he shows the way E.T's mouth moves when speaking in the 1982 version,(like a puppet) compared to how it moves in the 2002 version (he looks like he's really saying \\"home\\" or whatever dialog he's saying in a scene. He's WAY MORE LIFELIKE and more BELIVEABLE. Isn't that why we watch E.T- to suspend our disbelief and get lost in the story and the characters? If Speilberg could find a way to enhace the believablity and improve upon certain scenes, what's wrong with that? He knows what he's doing. ...Speilberg himself said the guns made him uneasy, and frankly, as the mother of a three-year old, I prefer not to have to explain to my daughter why those men have guns (which they never point, and are totally unnessary.) So it doesn't look odd at all to have walkie-talkies in their place, since they are not pointing walkie-talkies in place of guns, which was what I expected from reading that nasty review. I understand they wanted to make it more family-friendly, so my only complaint was, why not clean up the language? Was it really necessary for Elliot to call his brother \\"Penis Breath?\\" I know it's a funny and shocking line, by the mom's reaction, but it's not something I like my 3 year old to hear. All in all, this was a great package, and has wonderful bonus features on both disks,and I recommend it for anyone who likes beautiful touching family films with a message about love, tolerance, and friendship. We all need that.
6302862949|3.0|Dated, yes....but I bought it because of the first five minutes, when Misha dances a ballet of utmost beauty...if the whole rest of the plot is dated and silly, those first five minutes or so will leave you breathless, as it's a tribute to the beauty of Baryshnikov as a dancer. Typical cold war, Russians vs. US plot, with a few more memorable sequences of Misha and Gregory Hines doing their thing, both exceptional talents. Buy it for the dance sequences, forget the storyline, and I think you'll be satisfied.
0446608955|3.0|&quot;A Walk to Remember,&quot; by Nicholas Sparks is a heart-warming novel about two young people who are completely different, but they convene with the help of faith and fell in love. Together they overcome the negative remarks made by the popular &quot;in&quot; crowd and enjoy a relationship built on the strong foundations of trust and religion. This beautifully written book by Sparks deserves a rating of 8 from a scale of 1-10. Though the plot is sad, it was not enough to leave me in tears. Landom promises the readers that the book will bring smiles and tears, &quot;First you will smile, and then you will cry- don't say you haven't been warned...&quot; If it had made me cry then maybe it would have been a solid 10 rating. Sparks simple created a young man who was all about reputation to a complete romantic. Overall, the chemistry and romance between Jamie and Landon is satisfying. I enjoyed the park where Landon recites a quote from the bible that begins with &quot;Love is patient, love is kind...&quot; That definitely describes the love that Jamie has given him. Sparks diction is old fashion. His language is simple. Landon's tone when he was 57 years old is reminiscent; while the tone of a 17 years old Landon is a hopeless romantic. If you liked &quot;The Notebook&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; then you'll like this book.
B00005JKOI|5.0|Pretty in Pink? ahhh, what can I say? Ms. Ringwald in that role of Andie was my greatest role model growing up in the 80's. In this role, she was sassy, an individualist, in a world that said the car you drive is more important. I never get tired of watching this movie...and I suspect it will live on, mainly for the plot...boy wants girl, girl wants another boy, boy ditches girl...girl falls back on the boy who dotes on her...but she can't commit...what a dilemma!<BR>I also looked up to Annie Potts, what a brilliant role she played as Annie's friend, [X] co-worker, who drives her on to better, and bolder, ideas....she was/and is, a true gem of an actress..<BR>watch it once, but better yet, watch it again@<BR>This isn't one to miss!

B00005JKZ3|2.0|The original Men in Black was a rather clever film that exploded at the box office. It was funny, at that time it was original, and it didn't take itself too seriously. So, I went in expecting the sequel to be just as impressive, if not more, for surely if they could lure these stars back after a few years, they must have a pretty solid script full of non-stop laughs, right? Wrong. <br />It is astonishing how much this sequel resembles a \\"B\\" movie. This flick smells of Hollywood executives having a bit of extra money lying around and itching to make a few more bucks off this premise. The story was so flimsy and second-rate that it's hard to believe that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones even agreed to sign on to this after they read the script. Sure, there were highlights: the pug, for example, was very funny. But, do you really want to spend a few bucks seeing what you already saw in the trailer? Because beyond the pug, the humor is very limited here.<br />Which is not to say that Smith and Jones have lost their edge; to the contrary, their performances are more than decent despite the lousy script. If only they had words to say as funny as their facial expressions, this would have been a great entertaining film. There is really nothing new to offer. If you've seen the first one, you've seen this one; unfortunately, the sequel is a poor man's version of MIB I.
B00004XONN|5.0|Breathtaking, a must have for any one who claims to have even half decent taste. Listen to Idioteque and know beauty in its purest form.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I had been hearing about this show, but I had no idea that it was this good!  I saw one episode before my family and I moved to Germany.  It was the episode wear Charlotte gets hooked on the vibrator.  I thought it was great and was sad to find out that I wouldn't see the rest of the series.  Then one day, on Saturday, I walked into the video store and there was season two sitting on the shelf, with the cover all battered and worn from rental use.  I didn't want to start with season two, so I asked if they had season one.  Sure enough, someone was just returning it, in its battered and worn cover from rental, to the store.  I rented both and couldn't stop myself from watching.<br />Now, I'm hooked and hoping my video store has season three.  I guess the reason I didn't know that they had the first two was because they stayed rented out so much.  I have never seen a show that just sizzled with truth about dating and relationships.  Thanks HBO, you have really been churning out some good original shows.
B00003CX8J|5.0|X-MEN was great no doubt about it. This movie is what a lot of us had been waiting for years, a movie based on a Marvel series that wasn't terrible (IE: remember Dolph Lundgren in that awful PUNISHER movie? And let's not forget any of the made for TV Marvel movies that also did no justice to the great Marvel name).<br />Now for any of you older X-MEN fans that have some of the original comics, X-MEN the movie does stray away from the original series because in the original series, the first X-Men were Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel and Ice Man (when they made Ice Man like a snow man). This one went with the most notable X-Men, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm and Rogue. That and another thing that might bother older fans is how Rogue is introduced as a 16 year old girl when in the original series, she is introduced as an enemy to the X-Men after stealing the powers of Ms. Marvel.<br />One last thing that absolutely bothered me was that Sabretooth wasn't the 8' tall, buff as hell, ominous monster that he is in the comics. Personally, he looked like a regular guy who snarled and had bad nails. Don't get me wrong, X-MEN the movie is otherwise nearly flawless and very entertaining and very cool. I'd suggest this movie to anyone, whether Sci Fi fans, X-Men fans or Action movie fans. It's definitely worth your money!<br />Another thing I would suggest (especially if you're a Marvel fan) is SPIDERMAN. Another impressive remake of the very popular marquee Marvel series. It's as visually striking as it is to watch. These are noth 2 great additions to anyone's DVD library!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I've been waiting for this album for what seems like forever..and after 1 listen I'm not dissapointed. When I heard Cochise I was under the initial impression that this was just going to be ratm part 2 with chris cornell singing instead of zach's scream/rapping. However, after hearing the rest of the cd, I must say I'm impressed with the growth and change. The album has a zeppelin/70's funky-rock vibe on a few tracks, which isn't new for the former members of rage nor cornell. Other tracks are much more gentle. I can't put my finger on the sound just yet..and that's a good thing, they have some kind of a sound of their own. <br />The only problem I have with this band is that it seems to be lacking a purpose like RATM..cornell certainly isn't running around spewing out political rants like de la rocha..but I can tell you now that I'd take Chris' pipes over Zach's anyday..the man can sing! <br />Morello's guitar playing seems to have expanded alot..he dabbles in out-of-this world sounds..but he's definately broadened his playing..he actually throws in a little melodic noodleing in place of his usual dj-like noise at times. <br />In the end, this album will rock you..if that's what you're looking for. I'm not quite sure where cornell's lyrics fall, but they certainly lack the firey passion present in de la rocha's..maybe they're more personal and will take longer to decode..but they certainly don't reach out and grab me like zach's..this band is more traditional in its purpose and aspirations...but they sure as hell can rock like nobody's business. So don't come here lookin for the next rage or soundgarden, and avoid comparing them to either band..You'll see that audioslave has its own little niche, and pretty much blows away the other clichèd modern rock trash in the mainstream today.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I must admit, a comic book fan I am NOT. So, I'm not familliar with anything to do with Spiderman. Heck, I didn't even know the guy's name was Peter Parker. So, I came into this movie with no preconceptions and no expectations.<br />I can say this: It IS a fun movie. It has some pretty cool special effects and I like the characters for the most part. It is a typical superhero movie, although I find &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The X Men&quot; to be superior films. Tobey McGwire does a very good job portraying the unlikely hero. I also liked Kirsten Dunst, but that goes without saying. <br />I think I am just amazed at how cartoonish and bland some of the climactic action sequences were. This movie is a strange case where I found the plot and character moments much more satisfying and believable than the actual action. <br />As much as I like Willem Defoe, the villan in this movie is HORRIBLE, and the villan in these cheesy flicks is basically a &quot;make or break&quot; point. Maybe this is why the action sequences did nothing for me. <br />I'm amazed that this film outgrossed Star Wars. At the same time, I think a sequel done with a slightly better villan and a somewhat more serious plot might just work.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This was a great cd. We are all going to miss kurt.
B00000255X|2.0|If you´re a beginner to Dulan´s sound, skip this album. If you´re a long time fan, you probably already know this turkey.<br />His is he mos uninspired DYlan album I´ve ever heard.
B00006F7S4|4.0|He's a long way from the let-your-hair-down Hot Tub party he threw on 1999's \\"Midnight Vultures\\", and maybe that's just the reason that Beck's latest album is such a stand-out.  <br />\\"Sea Change\\" is an hour in the life of a break-up and, by the sound of things, I'm guessing its one of the first hours.  For most of the album, you can almost see him sitting at a dimly-lit desk, singing to a framed-picture of someone he's just lost.  Maybe there's a tear in his eye, or maybe he's cried all he can. The pain is fresh.  And, while he may be depressed, he is no less artistic and creative (albeit more simplistic) in the music he makes from his loss.<br />Songs like \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" relive the kind of pain he explored with \\"Nobody's Fault But My Own\\" from 1998's \\"Mutations\\" album.  \\"Its only lies that I'm livin' / It's only tears the I'm cryin' / It's only you that I'm losin' / Guess I'm doing fine,\\" he sings, and the pain is uncharacteristically simple.  <br />And so is the music.  While \\"Vultures\\" and his breakout album, \\"Odelay,\\" were hour-long battles for musical supremacy between any and every instrument at Beck's disposal, \\"Sea Change\\" is a stripped-down (but not all the way down) concentration on melody.  \\"Paper Tiger's\\" mood zigs and zags with its orchestral arrangement, while \\"Lonesome Tears\\" soars higher and higher until it reaches overload and it's wings melt.  <br />And while he surely spends some time reflecting on loss, it isn't the only subject under review.  On \\"Lost Cause,\\" Beck washes his hands of a failed romance.  \\"I cannot believe / you've got a devil up your sleeve\\" he sings on \\"All In Your Mind\\" and the simplicity with which he conveys his disappointment is heartbreaking.<br />While his vocals may be a little weak, the rawness in his voice makes his words more universal.  He's going through a rough time, and we're glad that he wants to share.
B00003OO3O|3.0|UFO´s Force IT is another example (if we need one!) of how one should not pay attention or think about hard rock lyrics...<br />How such a powerful band, with Schenker, Mogg, Way, Raymond and Parker can write such [poor] lyrics that does not make any sense at all, where you don´t have the slightest clue about what they´re talking about.<br />As for the music, word aren´t needed. It´s hard rock at its marvellous best.
B00006RU5B|4.0|There are only a few things that gel great together when each has different experience.  Audioslave is one of them.  When you take the musical talent of Rage Against The Machine and you add the voice of Soundgarden what have you got.....You've got Rock &amp; Roll!  This album is not like Rage or the Garden, I prefer to call it a work of art. The different melodies explored by the two groups and the hard feel of the band make this album one to add to your collection.  From the pounding introduction and classic guitar of Tom Morello in \\"Cochise\\" to the melodic content in \\"I am the Highway\\", back to the explosive rock you expect and hoped for in \\"Light my Way.\\" This album is worth the Andrew Jackson it sells for. Get up and get your copy now! This Album kick's @ss and was definitely worth the wait. It's all about making noise.
0385484518|5.0|This wonderful, if sad, book about Morrie Schwartz is a story of two men, one young, one old, and about the lessons of life as passed from one generation to the next.  Mr. Schwartz's philosophy of life, passed on each Tuesday, to his former student, Mr. Ablom, can be a philosophy for us all.  This man, Mr. Schwartz, and his ability to deal with ALS in such a way as most of us could never imagine, is a great example of courage.  Where we might feel sorry for ourselves (which he does, but only a little) and leave it at that, Mr. Schwartz moves on, dealing with his affliction (ALS).  His views of life, love, relationships, and the things people value: love, money, sex, and so on, may seem naive to some, simplistic to many, but in the end, there is a lot of truth to what he said.<BR>I have no doubt Mr. Ablom came away from his \\"lessons\\" with his former professor a (hopefully) better person and I believe we could all come away better if we would read and adopt the late Mr. Schwartz's views.  It's a wonderful book, a bit sad, as I stated at the beginning but I'd highly recommend it to anyone who (when they feel overshadowed by life's trials and tribulations) sees how one man dealt with them.  May the late Mr. Schwartz be eternally blessed.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|Don't buy this unless you already saw it and liked it. It is not as good as Indiana Jones like people say. Angelina is a good actress but is slightly cheesy in this role. Effects are pretty darn good though but storyline is missing something.<br />Overall it is a renter on my part.
B00003CXBK|5.0|As an old-school anime fan I was at first put off by the obvious American influence in this movie, especially in the dubbed version. I was very sad at the thought of such a classic cult phenomenon as Anime' being mainstreamed; the same feeling I had gotten when I saw that, after twenty years, George Lucas had finally digitized Yoda. I was sure I was about to watch the death of something unique that had been swallowed into the mass media forever, and I prepared to greive and gripe nonstop. <BR> That feeling lasted about thirty seconds. <BR> I have sinced watched Princess Mononoke about fifteen times, and each time it gets better and better. Old-school fans, take heart - it's not the gut-twisting violence of Akira or the tongue-in-cheek comedy of Dirty Pair, but Mononoke offers superb, smooth-flowing animation of exquisite detail and texture. All the quality one could ever expect from today's high-tech animation is readily visible, but you won't see CG anywhere.<BR> The story details and violence might be a bit much for the little kids, but adults will love it. Simplistic themes of man-against-man and man-against-nature tangle intimately with underlying tones of mystery, community, love, despair, and ultimate sacrifice. This is a complex movie; it lacks the rough edges so common in line-drawn animation. Neither is it a bland, commercial delivery mass-produced for inspection. It is ART. It is PASSION. It sits in the mind and heart like a well-shaped stone in a Zen garden, awaiting contemplation without distressing the stomach.<BR> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in animation (Japanese or American - Disney fans, beware the quality coming at you, it might unseat you!) or to families with children old enough to grasp the concept of a small struggle inside a larger one, inside a massive one. My seven-year-old will be seeing it shortly - with me. AGAIN. Aw, heck - I recommend it to ANYONE who enjoys a good story and likes to watch good movies. Just make sure you have a lot of time on your hands; you're going to watch this disc often.
B00005LOUP|3.0|It is a cute movie for kids but adult value is low. Kind of boring nice imagery and art, Jim looks great but not worth 2 hrs film time. I'd rent something else if you are an adult watching it w kids.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is a jewel in my CD rack. Although the most memorable Dream Theatre songs are on Images and Words, this masterpiece cannot exactly be called a collection of songs. Rather it sounds like one whole song, since there is a continuity between the tracks except in the change of acts. However, let me do something unforgivable. Let me evaluate the tracks piece by piece as though they were totally disconnected.<br />1. Regression: a mellow acoustic opener with the memorable tick-tock of the hypnotherapist's clock, not the most memorable track on the CD but deserves an 8/10 just the same<br />2. Overture 1928: this instrumental is the connection between the real world and the subconscious world in these theme album and it blows you away! 10/10<br />3. Strange Deja-Vu: the way DT manage to change into various styles in the same song is absolutely unique 9.5/10<br />4. Through My Words: another melodic acoustic 8/10<br />5. Fatal Tragedy: good track, yet even though it deserves 9/10, it is still not the most memorable on this CD<br />6. Beyond This Life: a chunky piece of trash metal 9/10<br />7. Though Her Eyes: nice weepy ballad 9.5/10<br />8. Home: this track is so darn good, so much the best on this CD, so much the best track ever written by a rock band, that I have to breach the rules and give it a 12/10. It is almost thirteen minutes long and it is not one bit boring. And that sitar works beautifully. Only musical geniuses can write such a song since words cannot describe its beauty.<br />9. Dance of Eternity: this is instrumental make take long to get used to since it may seem to be just an emotionless display of Dream Theatre's skill but it's a great instrumental .... and the way the song slows down for the 1920s piano piece and then starts once again is wowww ..... marvellous! 9.5/10<br />10. One Last Time: this is the start of a memorable trilogy of songs which end this album 9.5/10<br />11. The Spirit Carries On: This ballad is really the tops! 10/10<br />12. Finally Free: Perfect closer for a perfect album. 9.5/10<br />Instead of wasting your money on ... buy this CD, it is [well] worth it. These are the masters of contemporary music. All make a standing ovation in respect for this great band.

0316666343|5.0|Once I began reading this book, I could not put it down!  It was touching, disturbing and incredibly well written.  I highly recommend it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of those movies that you either love or hate. In my case, I found the plot and characters very interesting. The idea of feeling good (or bad, I was not sure) about your life by pounding the crap out of each other was an idea that might not have worked out under another director's belt. But Fight Club's director, David Fincher (Se7en, Alien 3) does what he does best in creating a dark, creepy setting, full of plot twists and clever dialogue. In the beginning, Fight Club is full of humor. Our unnamed hero goes to support groups for people with various diseases. Although he does not have any of these diseases, he goes to feel better about himself. The first 30 minutes could be described as a dark comedy, but as the film progresses into the actual \\"Fight Club\\" stage, it gets more and more like a psychological thriller. Though, through bloody fights and confusing plot twists, we begin to see that Fight Club is much more than just a thriller. It tells us that we need to hnestly confront our own demons in order to figure out who we are, who we want to become, and how to take control of our lives. With good performances all around, I recomend Fight Club highly to anyone who wants more than just an ordinary thrill ride. PS: For another good thriller that makes you <BR>think, I recommend \\"the Usual Suspects\\".
0316548189|5.0|This book deserves a 10 star rating.<br />Nelson Mandela is not only a hero of mine, he also symbolizes human rights and the struggle for equality.  Long Walk to Freedom is a remarkable story of a hero's journey.<br />I am a white man who grew up in a sheltered, white, middle class neighborhood.  I have been enlightened after reading this book.  In the past, I heard minor stories of Apartheid (from the white perspective), but I never knew about the horrifying human rights violations that were an everyday occurance for black and other non-white South Africans.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding Mandela's heroic life and the great antiapartheid movement.  I would also recommend that this story be read by all future generations in all learning institutions.<br />This is the story of a hero, one of the greatest heroes of all time.
B00006M183|5.0|If you are a fan of Pearl Jam or of good rock, buy this album, it will be a classic someday.
0634014331|4.0|I thought there were no Hammond methods, but somehow I found this one, and it's a good starting point for neophytes of the B-3 and drawbar organs. Don't expect it to disclose all the techniques you heard on Jimmy Smith's records, but it can be really useful as a reference book. The addition of the CD is absolutely essential: a good feature from the author. <BR>It's a fairly good catalogue of riffs, although I wish it focused a lot more on funk and jazzy riffs (there are some good examples, however -but not enough nor representative) than on poppy ballads and clichs. <BR>Anyway,at least it can lend some help to us forgotten organists and lovers of the Hammond!
B000002HRE|1.0|This is far and away Metallica's worst effort. Every song on Reload sounds like some sort of corny parody of thier past (and often great) works. Very disapointing. Avoid.
B00006L83N|5.0|As a relative neophyte to the metallice stylings of Symphony X (though not to progressive music by any means) I waited with braced anticipation the release of this album.  I have heard some of the older SyX songs and absolutely love them, but wanted the Odyssey to be my first purchase.  This may have been a mistake. <br />This album is so utterly, mind blowing, amazing (the list could go on!) that I honestly wonder if it can get any better!  (Actually, it just whet my appetite for more!)  Every song on this album is a real masterpiece, with some fantastic highlights.  The title track is one of the greatest concept songs I have ever heard, masterfully continuing the imagery and art found on the cover of the album and painting a fantastic tapestry of the voyage and trials of Odysseus.  Accolade II is just one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of music I have ever heard.  Awakenings proves again that these guys are masters of their craft.  Russel Allen's dualistic vocal work on The Turning is great, and the terror of King of Terrors is palpable.<br />In short, this is one of the greatest albums I have purchased in years, and would recommend it to anyone interested in some truly great music that defies simple catagorization.
B00000BKDS|5.0|This is were it all started (unless you count the 'Sound House Tapes). Iron Maiden, the cream of the NWOBHM hit Britain with this albam that would jump strait to N# 04. Make no doubt this is an excellent albam, strait from the first track, Prowler, you know this is something special. The pace continues in sanctuary, and the EXCELLENT Phantom of the opera and the strange but beautyful Charlotte the Harlot and the fan fav Iron Maiden. <br />As a band, Maiden show how good they were at a younger age, Di'anno vocals perfect for the job, and its difficult to imagine Bruce singing instead, although he would do later on. Murray and Stratton are killer together, whilst Harris plays the bass superb. Clive Burr is very steady on drums and keeps the band on course.<br />This albam is full of classics that are a found memory in any Maiden fan whoes heard this albam. Buy it, buy it now.
B000066AXC|4.0|I just finished watching In The Bedroom two days ago. Then I watched the other best picture nominee (Beautiful Mind), the one that won, today.<br />I really think that Oscar should have went to Bedroom or Moulin Rouge. A Beautiful mind is good but not perfect. If it is slightly better than a perfect hollywood movie, that is because of Jennifer Connelly and Russel Crowe. They were amazing. Ed Harris's appearance seemed almost a cameo in comparison. (I should add, Harris is one of my favorite actors.)<br />I thought the second half was much better than the first...I actually yawned in the first hour! Even though In the Bedroom was an even slower-moving movie than this movie, I just didn't find a false note in Bedroom. In Beautiful Mind, I actually noticed camera angles, mood music, camera set ups.<br />Nevertheless, I recommend this movie based on the two leads' performances, but more importantly, the introduction to a true/real life love story between two incredible human beings.
B00005JKG9|5.0|As a future realtor; this movie was very helpful; so is this what it really is like being a realtor??  No respect; dog eat dog; lies; etc. wow what a career.
B00005YTFG|5.0|What a movie...I was not expecting anything and pow! Within 5 minutes, after the shock of its originality wore off, I loved every second of it. A totally new way of looking at a musical. Madonna can only wish her movies came off this well.<br />It's like watching your favourite music video continue on for a couple of hours! It moved at a breathtaking pace. I was never bored.<br />I really wanted Nicol to win the Oscar. (I also think Sissy Spacek would have been a worthy cadidate for In The Bedroom).<br />Kudos to the production, directions, costumes, and music. Hey, this is the first time in almost 50 years a challenger to the great Marilyn Monroe rendition of Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend has appeared! That alone is worth the price of this rental!! Enjoy...
B00006RU5B|4.0|When Zach De La Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, I'm sure that I was one of many who felt that the remaining members wouldn't be able to survive the demise of one of the best and most influential bands of the last decade.  When I heard that Chris Cornell was jamming with the remnants of RATM, I was excited at first and then skeptical.  It never felt so good to be wrong.<br />The alt-rock supergroup, christened Audioslave, comes out with a slew of introspective alt-rock songs on their debut disc that will satisfy fans of both Soundgarden and RATM, while introducing a whole group of new fans that have been inundated with second tier rock-rap to some of the founding fathers alternative hard rock.<br />The Cochise single is a powerful opening to this album that ranges from hard rocking, funk dirges to deep, melancholy songs that showcase both Tom Morello's inventive songwriting and Cornell's heartfelt vocals.<br />Fans of RATM will not be disappointed for it seems that the core RATM members are writing the majority of the music, although Cornell's contributions are obvious.  Cornell's lyrics have evolved from his Soundgarden days and seem more focused.  This project is also a welcome change of pace from Cornell's off-beat and experimental solo project.<br />Audioslave has the makings of the first supergroup to emerge from the &quot;alternative&quot; revolution and may even have the chops to transcend their respective histories.
B000066NW0|4.0|I must confess I wasn't too sure I was making the right decision when I spent my money on this CD, but now I don't regret it at all. I listen to it all the time, especially the songs Complicated, Sk8er Boi, Mobile, Anything But Ordinary, Things I'll Never Say, My World, and Nobody's Fool. The other songs are either too slow or too &quot;punk&quot;. I like the way she writes about real issues like in Things I'll Never Say. (Nobody's Fool is just WEIRD, but that's part of the attraction.) I think we have something really great in Avril Lavigne.
0380713802|4.0|I'm glad I read this book in the privacy of my own home. If I had been reading this in public, I would have been mistaken for one of those crazy people you see sitting at coffee shops and laughing hysterically by themselves.<br />This is the first book I have read by Bill Bryson, and I was completely impressed. As I was reading through this book, I had to keep myself from running back to the bookstore and buying his whole collection.<br />In &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; Bryson is reliving a journey he had taken through Europe in his youth. If you've ever been to Europe, you will deeply appreciate the sarcastic humor that Bryson uses to describe the people he meets and the places he visits.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|You won't win many popularity contests by professing to be an A-ha fan, but these guys have been making quality pop music for almost 20 years now.  A-ha has always been for the person with a bounce to their step and a sentimental heart and regretably neither has been much of priority for American audiences since the early nineties.<br />Somehow, I have remained fond of the bands sound for each of the six records that followed Hunting High and Low.  This one, their sixth overall (they have a new one called Lifelines), ended a seven year absence and the time off definitely paid off.  The group returned more confident and, song for song, this is their best album.  Even as a fan, I can admit that a couple of A-ha's albums had some spotty moments (Stay on These Roads, Memorial Beach).  This record though is consistant throughout.<br />My favorite song is probably Summer Moved On, but the record really is a nightmare for anyone trying to make a A-ha compilation.  There are simply too many great songs here to be able to discriminate which to include and which to leave off.<br />The only track I don't care for is Barely Hanging On.  Velvet could have (and should have) done for A-ha what Ordinary World did for Duran Duran.  As fate would have it, a cameo in a Matt Dillon flick is the best the track could muster.  Its a shame.  I Wish I Cared is a frequently quoted favorite by A-ha fans for good reason.  The track is supported by dreamy synth work (I believe by Pal Waaktaar) that would serve proudly on any record by the significantly more chic Everything But The Girl and Morton Harket's vocals soar during the chorus.  Other hightlights include the title cut, Little Black Heart and Thought That It Was You.<br />It is frustrating when good music isn't properly recognized but in a way, I listen to this record and wonder if A-ha's unseen brillance is actually better this way - as our little secret.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I am surprised there are people, who actually don't like this album. It is better then all other Metallica albums so far. The classics sound perfect with the orchestra and the way James Hetfield sings, is simply fantastic! <BR>I have to agree that a few songs - Of Wolf And Man or Minus Human - are not performed in a 5-star way, but they still sound great. The best track is Outlaw Torn, by far, but I think No Leaf Clover, Bleeding Me, Master Of Puppets and The Call Of Ktulu are good too.<BR>All people should listen to it at least once. Metallica have proven that there is no other band on this planet that could play such great music as they do.<BR>Now about the songs, each rated 1 to 10:<br />The Ecstasy Of Gold: 8.6/10<BR>The Call Of Ktulu: 9.1/10<BR>Master Of Puppets: 9.5/10<BR>Of Wolf And Man: 8.0/10<BR>The Thing That Should Not Be: 8.5/10<BR>Fuel: 9.4/10<BR>The Memory Remains: 9.5/10<BR>No Leaf Clover: 9.5/0<BR>Hero Of The Day: 9.1/10<BR>Devil's Dance: 8.9/10<BR>Bleeding Me: 9.8/10<br />Nothing Else Matters: 9.2/10<BR>Until It Sleeps: 9.3/10<BR>For Whom The Bell Tolls: 9.9/10<BR>Minus Human: 8.1/10<BR>Wherever I May Roam: 9.0/10<BR>Outlaw Torn: 10/10<BR>Sad But True: 9.4/10<BR>One: 9.8/10<BR>Enter Sandman: 9.5/10<BR>Battery: 9.3/10

B000002UJQ|5.0|I can't believe the reviews that say &quot;I like Karma Police and Paranoid Android but everything else is garbage&quot;. Just as a lot of other people have said, the first time i listened to Ok Computer I wasn't that impressed. The only song that stood out in my mind was Let Down. But after having the cd for awhile I can't understand how I ever thought that way. This CD is a masterpiece from start to finish.

0316666343|3.0|Susie Salmon murdered at age fourteen narrates the story of her family as they deal with the aftermath of her death. A heart-wrenching story that keeps you turning page after page in search of resolution. She shares the details of her after-life and the loss that she feels for her own youth. Alice has incredible descriptions of the dispute between holding on and letting go. I felt that the ending was anticlimatic, but Alice has amazing potential.  I think that she fell into some great commercial success, but the book is overrated. A predictable, but good read! Just try to have realistic expectations before reading and you will enjoy it.
B00006LLNV|5.0|this sound track has some real mexican music.<BR>i really think is one of the best sound track for a mexican movie
0060930187|5.0|This is the first and last novel of Sylvia Plath and a permanent indention in the literary world. The story begins with the awakening of a young Esther Greenwood to her own uniqueness and eventually the self-awareness that drove her mad. She realizes that she is alone in the world and that there was no one that in any way resembled herself. She shares her innermost thoughts of those around her: <BR>      &quot;The figures around me weren't people, but shop dummies,   painted to resemble people and propped up in attitudes counterfeiting life.&quot; She also reflects with her own difficulties with the prospects of love.<BR>   &quot;And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restrauraunt dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what she secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat. What a man wants is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security, and, what a man is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the arrow shoots off from.&quot; This story was the self-prophecy of Sylvia Plath and allows us to travel on her potent emotionally wrenching journey.
0553470485|5.0|As we drove 500 miles in the car on our way to visit a relative, my 2 and 5 year-old sons and I listened to this tape. It was simply wonderful. They had not heard the book read aloud to them yet and they loved the story.<br />The best part of this recording is that the author is the narrator. There is something special that happens when we are privileged to hear an author read his own work. There are slight nuances we may miss when reading the book to ourselves or aloud, the tone of the voice, the slightly different voices for each character and so on. E.B. White's Maine accent is wonderful to listen to.<br />There are plenty of book summaries and reviews that discuss the content of the story so I won't repeat that. Suffice it to say this is a wonderful story about friendship, loneliness, empathy and teamwork. The mourning of a natural death of a friend is counterbalanced with the joy of birth and making new friendships.<br />Do yourself and your children a favor and listen to this audio recording. It is wonderful for long trips in the car, for listening to before bed, or while working on an art project or with Lego's.<br />A pure delight!
B00003CXI1|3.0|The down side of this DVD is that the extras seem to be aimed more at kids than adults.  I would have liked to see more about the making of the movie - how the F/X were done, the location choosen to be Hogwarts, etc.  If you are a fan of the Harry Potter books, you will find the look of the movie to be just as your imagination might have built it.  The casting is abosolutely first rate - Emma Watson as Hermione was perfect, as was Alan Rickman as Snape.  The one downfall of the movie seems to be a general failure to capture the magic of the story.
B000067DNC|3.0|Yes, it's a great series. Yes, we're all smiling silly at the opportunity to see the episodes in season 2. But the DVD format is supposed to allow for the inclusion of extras, which simply aren't there this time. Very sad. Season 1 DVDs had captions; not this time. Season 1 DVDs had several featurettes; season 2 has only one. Season 1 had innovative navigation screens; season 2's is as dull as can be.<br />Season 2 DVDs should improve on the first season's release, being better, richer, not less so. In any case, this series is remarkable by the quality of its screenplays, production, concepts and ideas - if you like sci-fi, you should check it out.<br />We can only hope that Season 3 will come anytime soon and will have what every DVD release has: extras (in addition to great sound and picture quality, of course).
B00006LHYC|4.0|I love Laura Pausini and look out when the US catches on to her!  There are some positively awesome songs here that will be on her 'english greatest hits CD is 10 years&quot;, lol.  There are two remakes of previous music- but with English words.  The other thing the impresses the heck out of me is that she didn't run to  the Backstreet Boys producers to make her English CD like so many stars do now-a-days to sellout for a radio friendly approach.  Laura's music is accessible and she does just fine with the formula she's got.  In the liner notes, it is full of Italian and Latin names..showing she is true to herself and her style that has made her famous.  The first track, &quot;I Need Love&quot; is awesome and catchy!  The best ballad (imo) is &quot;Without You&quot;.  I would also reccomend her &quot;E Ritorno Da Te&quot; (italian version) for new listeners.  It's a greatest hits collections and it's fantastic.  GOOD FOR LAURA!
B000077VPU|3.0|I owned it on laserdisc and I've been waiting for the DVD release for a long time....so when I bought it (Region 4)...Well I am very disappointed....the first part of the show (Metallica, Def Lepard, Extreme..)was taken out of the DVD !!! So tell me why they insert extra material and cut out the first part of the show ??
B000068QY7|4.0|It may not their best album to date but Noel Gallagher did say he didn't think he'd ever better Morning Glory.<BR>  At a point where i thought the once almighty oasis had nothing more to offer comes a wonderful surprise that will keep fans and critics alike content for the next few years.<BR>  The songwriting buck has been passed and Noel puts pen to paper on 6 of the 11 tracks including the opening 'Hindu Times', 'little by little' and the spirit lifting 'she is love' with Liam Gallagher not only trying his hand at writing but actually doing a pretty impressive job with 'songbird' and Born on a different Cloud' as well as including contributions from Andy Bell and Jem Archer.<BR>  Unfortunately the band self produced the album so the dirty grunge sound remains but it's more than a step back in the right direction from the last album.<BR>  The beatles influences, a binding factor in the band still surface at times but there is by far no question that the album is a work of good music and originality.Although not being too adventerous lyrically there are bands and artists who are also suffering from similar ailments at the moment but it's an all round well crafted piece of work.Although a shame that they will never fully break America because of their terrible attitude in the past it would be a crime to let that stand in the way of listening to this.<BR>You'd do much worse than to add this one to your collection.<BR>Listen without prejudice.
B000002U9W|4.0|This album characterizes a highly experimental period of the Floyd, between their highly psychedelic early years and their more progressive works which were to come following this album, such as &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; It's by no means an easy listening album, nor Floyd's most experimental either (Ummagumma has that title well earned, in my opinion): it has a very unique balance resulting from the crafty musical minds of Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason, the influence of Ron Geesin, fundamentally in the 24-minute epic suite that gives the album its title, and finally, the collaboration of Engineer Alan Parsons, who would break musical ground with the band later on with &quot;Dark Side...&quot;
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is quite possibly the best cd to come out in years.  After &quot;grunge&quot; died so did the music, but this cd proves there is still a spark of hope left. Great guitarist...the best rock vocalist ever...what more could you need.  Soundgarden fans will have a great time with cd, as will rage fans.  And if you are nither....,which is very wrong might i add, and you are just looking for a great rock cd, I highly recommend this one.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Okay, this is the first Eminem CD I've purchased. I did listen to \\"My Name Is\\" about a million times when it was overplayed by the radio stations before. And I recently watched \\"8 Mile\\" which was good. After seeing the Hollywood version of Eminem, I wanted to see why there was so much controversy over this guy. So I chose to buy the most infamous CD he had. \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" did not disappoint! There are MANY great tracks here, including \\"Stan\\", \\"Kill You\\", and \\"The Way I Am\\". I definitely recommend this as a good starter CD for new Eminem fans.<br />Be forewarned however, like it has been discussed before, the track \\"Kim\\" is totally messed up. Has a catchy chorus that will stick in your head though. :-p<br />Anyway, I'll be getting \\"The Eminem Show\\" next. See you then!

B000056BOR|4.0|I like this movie. It isn't my favorite Doris Day movie, nor my favorite Cary Grant movie, but it still has it's moments. The fashion scenes with Doris are great. My favorite scenes occur in the automat, where Doris's roommate works.  I also love the scene where Gig Young is talking to his homely secretary and looks her over and decides she might be beautiful under her glasses and pinned up hair, so he takes off her glasses and lets down her hair and... well, you'll just have to see the movie! Another great movie to stay at home and watch on a cold night!
B00006CXXU|5.0|So, I admit it. I never thought I (a 24 year old female) would actually plop down money on this CD, but thank goodness I did. I got the cd, put it into my player and listened to the entire thing twice. I was amazed at how much I liked it. Track 3-Walk Away is so strong and powerful I tend to replay it over and over. I hear it and think of some dark, smokey blues club. Then track 4-fighter comes on and suddenly I feel like a boxer working out some anger. Impossible is just as wonderful. In fact, the entire cd is like Christina saying &quot;Love me, like me, hate me..this is who I am. This is the music I wanted to create and share.&quot; <BR>You may dislike her attitude or her taste in apparel, but no one can disagree with her immense talent and honesty.<BR>If you have a few extra bucks in your pocket, go buy this cd!---Written by someone who enjoys a little variety in her life.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave is like a puzzle. You have two different peices, both belonging to a different puzzle. On one hand you have Chris Cornell, who fills this CD with his classic vocals and unforgettable voice. On the other hand, you have the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine. You have Tim Commerford on bass, Brad Wilk on drums, and Tom Morello on guitar. These guys are the other piece of the puzzle. This CD brings Chris Cornell together with the rest of the guys and makes an amazing puzzle from two different, yet both talented, worlds of music. They fit perfectly. <br />The first song titled, &quot;Cochise&quot;, is only the beginning to what this CD has to offer. It is full of classic RaTM guitar riffs and distortions, but, it also has a new sound that is all its own. They don't try to stick with the sounds of their old bands. (Chris Cornell and Soungarden. The rest of the guys and RaTM). They do well to bring their sound together, and they mix it up into a CD full of great listening pleasure.<br />This CD is a definate addition to your music collection. It has everything from harder, grinding songs. To more mellow, laid-back songs. This CD has it all. I can actually say that I like almost every song on this CD, that doesn't happen much. If you want to hear your favorite older sounds, mixed with a lot of new. Then this CD is definately worth checking out.
B00006LSM3|5.0|All I have to say is get this CD.  Great melodies and deep meaning.  Thank you George for all the lovely music.  You will be missed.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in a while.  It rocks! Hopefully they'll get back together and go on tour (with Rage Against the Machine &amp; Soundgarden)!
B00006CXXU|5.0|yo this album is dope....what can i say, she is the hottest gurrl on earth, and she's dirrty too...she can sing, she can dance, she is amazing, she inspired me to get my labret pierced ;-)  i think she is fierce for not taking whatever from loser guys and i love her new style, she better work :-)
B00006LSM3|4.0|George's last album, this selection comes 15 years after his dazzling Cloud 9 offering. While much of the zip that punctuated Harrison's earlier recordings is missing from Brainwashed due to his understandably weaker voice (think 2000's My Sweet Lord remix), this album is still well worth listening to. At times, the sound is pure Traveling Wilbury's, and other times, the introspectiveness of Harrison shines through.<br />I was skeptical about this album going in, because of the involvement of Jeff Lynne. However, I'm happy to say that the typically over-produced album that Lynne is noted for is not as prevalent this time around. Check out this album, I don't think you'll be disappointed!
B000002MH5|5.0|I first heard Dinosaur Jr., when Green Mind came out and was a casual fan.  But when Where You Been came out, I was blown away!!  Nobody wraps more emotion into a guitar solo than J Mascis.  The highlight for me is &quot;Get Me&quot; which just builds and builds to angst-filled, screaming guitar solo as the song closes .... and the chorus &quot;... you're not going to get me through this, are you?&quot; leaves me utterly drained.  I've read the other reviews hear and cannot at all agree with those who think this is a week DJ effort.  There is not a bad song on the album ....... I can't say that about Green Mind or any of their post-Where You Been efforts...
0375414053|1.0|Allison Pearson's novel is a screeching disappointment.  As a working mother, I happily ordered the book online after reading the New York Times Book Review recommendation that suggested that I was the prime audience.  Little did I know that this novel is a post-feminist backlash tract disguised as a feminist agenda.  It really should be marketed to smug stay at home Moms who have the economic freedom to make what they consider a \\"choice\\"--which really means that they have someone else to support them.  They will be pleased at the ending, which basically says that you can't do both.
B00006M183|4.0|This was Pearl Jams best CD start to finish since Vs, mainly because there are so many solid tracks.  The first song &quot;Can't Keep&quot; is an excellent example of Vedder's vocals and there is not a better rock and roll song on the album than &quot;Save You&quot;.  &quot;Cropduster&quot; is a classic and &quot;thumbing my way&quot; and &quot;I am Mine&quot; are two great tunes with excellent lyrics.  I still don't know what's going on with the song &quot;Arc&quot; though, its some kind of chant that could have been left off.  This CD was a huge upswing from Binaural and although No Code and Yield were both good, this album is more consistant all the way through.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I thought this movie was really great! Great animation, great storyline, great voices. Heartwarming tale of friends. And, seeing this in the theater, the short before the film (also included on the DVD) was worth the price of admission itself! Really funny.

1577311523|5.0|Who would imagine that a concept so simple as the NOW could be so easily forgotten?!  How could you forget what is?!  Well, after struggling with the premise that there are no problems, and really working to get my arms around Tolle's teaching of the NOW, I was hungry for more practical applications!  I could finally intuit the concept, but wanted ways to practice staying in the NOW.  I was turned onto another resource called Present Moment Awareness that gave me clarity of the NOW in simple and practical terms.  (So practical that I made it a required reading for my students.)  So, now the two books sit together at my bedside.  I thank you, Tolle, for compelling me to get present, and I thank you, Duncan, for teaching me how to stay present.
B00006JDVV|3.0|The theatrical version of the movie was something I had been holding my breath for in antici----pation. When it came I was almost satisfied. <BR>The acting was above average. Both of the main characters did an excellent job in their own right, but the producers could certainly have chosen MORE characters (actors) to fill in the gaps.<BR>The special effects were SPECTACULAR. I don't think anyone would question that one. This alone is reason to see the movie.<BR>The Plot is captivating and inspirational. I have been thinking of this premise, off an on, ever since I saw the movie and is frequently the topic of conversation to this day between several of my friends and myself.<BR>The execution of the plot, that is another situation entirely. As has been mentioned before there was certainly way too much talking and not enough fighting. I understand the limitations of budget and time on a project of this scale, but come on. They could have spent their time an energy working on one huge battle scene (with multiple dragons) for the end of the movie and spent the first part building up to it. There were several hundred dragons in London alone when the majority of the movie takes places. The characters see them when they assault the city to get the \\"king\\". Where are these other dragons when all this is going on...<BR>Well, anyway, for all its faults it is still worth seeing. I hope you enjoy it.
B00006HBUA|3.0|I seem to remember this movie just getting killed by critics when it was in theaters. After watching the DVD I realize that it wasn't that bad. It all probably depends on whether or not you grew up watching the cartoon as I did. With plenty of inside jokes regarding the predictability of the cartoon, makes it more than a kids movie. Even a reference to how so many fans thought the addition of Scrappy-Doo was terribly annoying. A fun kids movie with enough self-depriciating jokes about the cartoon for those (now) adults that grew up with it.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Fantastic action scenes.  Good story line, (withthe exception of the mush).  Two buddies grow up to become pilots in one of our countries darkest periods.  Depicts the courage of many different groups, Nurses, Sailors, Airmen,pretty well.  I especially liked it when Doolittle mad his appearance.  That guy had a backbone.  Worth watching many times.
0679735909|5.0|Possession is the story of two British literary scholars and their discovery of a century-old secret--the passionate relationship between two Victorian poets, the married and well-established Randolph Henry Ash, and the presumed lesbian feminist poet Christabel LaMotte.  The details of their brief affair are discovered slowly and inexorably through a trace of documents and linguistic ties: they are academic detectives.<br />Byatt prose is laced with literary allusions that any lover of British history and fiction will appreciate.  Notice for example that Maude Bailey is often described with reference to Yeat's muse because of her golden hair, or that Christabel LaMotte, whose family name suggests &quot;moth.&quot; she says &quot;no mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed.&quot;  In every sense, the plot of this novel is dense, its characters tightly-knit.  Discovering hidden meanings within the names and places of this novel was half the fun of reading it.<br />Possession is also a montage of the remaining documents of its characters' lives, which LaMotte says is the end motive of all writers--the longing to be preserved on the dusty shelf.  The contemporary storyline is juxtaposed with letters between the lovers, the diaries of Ash's wife and LaMotte's lover, Blanche, and the poetry itself, which reveals clues about the relationship invisible to the typcial, merely academic reading.  Some of these documents drag, but then again they create a type of tension.  The reader feels much like the scholars must have felt, looking for subtleties that may reveal an entire narrative.  <br />Running parallel to the nineteenth century narrative are the personal lives of the academics Maude Bailey and Roland Michell, who stand to turn the world of Ash and La Motte criticism on their head with their discovery.  I actually enjoyed their story even more than that of the poets.  They seemed more real,  more intimate, more subtle.  And like their objects of academic desire,they as well battle with the questions of possession, of possession of a person, an idea, or the possession associated with the brief insanity that overcomes the lover.<br />This novel is very time and emotion intensive, which makes the somewhat abrupt ending rather surprising.  After carefully weaving a narrative that spans over a century, Byatt wraps up her novel with what can be compared to a chase scene.  However satisfying it is to have the clues of this mystery all tied up, it left me wondering about the author's motives at the end.  But perhaps that is precisely the point of the romance: abruptly ended, fleetingly passionate, like a moth to the flame.<br />Possession was made recently into a more than adequate film, though some of the essentials have been changed, especially with regard to Roland Michell, who is portrayed in the film as a very charasmatic and inquisitive American.
B00005JRNN|4.0|OK, this is listed as the Hong Kong release, but I got the Australian release so who knows what you're gonna get. Either way, the track listing is the same. Everyone knows all about the regular Music album so I'm just going to review Disc 2 (the remix disc). OK,they chose to include the Deep Dish and HQ2 remixes of &quot;Music&quot;. Those were good choices, as I think those were 2 of the best among the Tracy Young and Groove Armada ones. Either of those 4 were good choices. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; was included as the Timo Maas and Tracy Young mixes. Again, awesome choices! The vission mix would have worked too. So far so good. Now, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;..they included the Paul Oakenfold Perfecto mix, but I think Paul's Saturday Night mix would have been a better choice because 1)It has more vocals than the perfecto mix and 2)it remains unreleased as promo-only. The other &quot;WIFLFAG&quot; version they include is the spanish version. This was an ok choice, but I think the Tracy Young or Vission Velvet Masta mix would have been a better choice. All in all, 6 audio tracks for you to enjoy. the final thing on this disc is the video portion. It includes the full uncensored video of &quot;What It Feels Like&quot; along with a mini 3-image photo gallery and cute interactive menu with the perfecto mix playing in the background. Overall grade: A-
B00005JKCH|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was very entertaining.  Although I had never followed the comic book series I was still able to follow along with this movie.  The movie had a good plot and a good story line.  I think that this is a movie for all.
B00006YXEK|5.0|i bought this album today (11/19/02), ten days short of the 1 year anniversary of George's passing, and it filled me with such a good feeling.  it was like he wasn't even gone, that he was still here and in a way, he is -- through the wonderful music on \\"Brainwashed\\".  the world has been waiting a long time to hear from George again and this album is so upbeat.  it's a good way to think of him, ending on a happy note.  the songs are amazing, the lyrics are meaningful, this could very well be George at his finest.  any George fan must add this album to his/her collection.  if i were you, i wouldn't miss this for the world!
B00006LSM3|4.0|It has been almost a year since the passing of George Harrison and now we have his long anticapated final release \\"Brainwashed\\" to enjoy.  The cd obviously sounds very Harrisonish with melodies that bring back memories of such work as \\"Thirty-three & 1/3\\" and the Traveling Wilbury's.  The classic Harrison slide guitar sound is prevalent throughout.  The tile track \\"Brainwashed\\" is a fantastic song about how all of us are brainwashed by modern day society and technology.  The best tune on the cd \\"Run So Far\\" was originally written for Eric Clapton by George for his \\"Journeyman\\" cd.  George's version could easily be an adult contemporary hit if it were to receive some airplay.  George plays and clowns with the Ukulele on  a couple of songs and his playing on the tune \\"Devil and The Deep Blue Sea\\" is not to be missed for a surprisingly pleasent vaudville sing a long.  The cd features Jeff Lynne[ELO]playing several instruments, Jim keltner on drums and the emergence of Dhani Harrison on guitar, wurlitzer and vocals.  It is quite obvious that a lot of care went into finalizing this record and thankfully they did not rush this out after George had passed.  Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison did the job right and a year after his passing George Harrison fans have good reason to smile, for he has left us with a fantastic final cd which is right up there with some of his best work.
0385484518|5.0|This book was one of the only book that I had a hard time reading.  I was such an emotional book that I found myself crying and wishing that Morrie would live forever.  I found this book to be very inspirational. It allowed me to reflect upon my life and see that living my life in the fast line was not allowing me to enjoy live.  I found myself don't being about to put down the book.  As well as long to hear every drop of wisdom and every philosophical point of view that Morrie had.  I want to be a Tuesday person just like more.  This is one book that anyone who has lose someone in there lives and relate to.  <BR>Its a self help book with a plot.
B00000HYXB|5.0|You have to love what Hansi and they guys have set out to do here To make a recording so vast , dripping with emotion and so EPIC and the truth is ? they pull it off splendidly. This is the best POWER metal I have ever heard and I have heard tones and tones of the stuff. From the fast yet precise drum work of Thomas Stauch<BR> through to the wonderfull guitar work of Andre Olbrich and Marcus Siepen. This recording will go down as the ultimate epic fantasy power metal recording of all time. From start to finish its pure energy and so much fun, you got to love it.
B00006NSGX|1.0|Obviously Eric's heart is no longer in the music.  I did not buy his last release, after hearing the drum machines in a preview at the store.  I should have passed on this one, also.  You will not recognize the song 'Cocaine' -- Donny Osmond or even Yanni could probably have done a better job.  What's up with the synthesizers and assorted pop/disco/whatever additions?  What a waste of talent.  Do us a favor and retire, Eric.  Just keep re-releasing the old stuff; because once you were the best, we just have to dig back a few years to try to prove it to anyone.  <br />Can I get a refund?
B00006LSM3|4.0|listening to brainwashed is like going back to 1970 and listening to all things must pass.  harrison displays his ukulele skills on devil & the deep blue sea. if you are a beatles or george harrison fan, or have ever heard of them, this is a must have.
B00000IUT7|2.0|This is the only train we have encountered with a \\"reset\\" button underneath which my son finds more interesting than the train itself. Now the bells and whistles go but the train does not. Why in the world did they put that button there when there are already 4 buttons on top? And yes, it does drain those batteries quick!
B000003FD9|5.0|Leslie Gerber's on the money with the comments above. A colossal set with incomparable HEARING (playing) by Starker. What a MUSICIAN, my gosh!!  Prelude of the First Suite gives IMMEDIATE peace-- it's overwhelming! the way Starker embodies the ends of phrases -- such patience!-- this is Bach eternal!  Where Fournier can move chapel into dance court, Starker makes no compromises- the metaphysical comes first!  The AIM sometimes less elegant, but pure temple Breathing once inside.  For me, the god Fournier makes everlasting Bach. I know this, still a part of me made conversion of some kind hearing the Truth of Starker's completely immediate Art in Prelude of the First suite!  I tell you, Suite freaks, if YOU havent heard this recording you need to. Wispelwey is bright and free, I know. Starker, however, is Religion without artifice. Check it for yourself.  I heard the Mercury recordings only once & they stunned me. I should listen again. Tough to imagine another recording exceeding the depth of pure musical intention embodied in this one, but there's nothing valedictorian in Starker's understanding. This is Pure Musical Art, & as good as it gets.
B00006LHYC|5.0|To begin, Laura is an amazing singer which has already demonstrated to half of the world she can sing in italian, spanish, portuguese and english long before she released this exclusive english album.  Pure voice talent, filled with great melodies and profound lyrics (no-nonsense). <BR>From the Inside offers so much more now, great music arrangements that have changed somewhat from her usual type of songs, obviously because of the mixture of producers she has on this CD (which is amazing who and how many she has).  &quot;I Need Love&quot;, which had to be the first one, is just a terrific song and she sings it beautifully. Includes new tempos, upbeat and sincere at the same time.  She sounds a bit different from her other CDs due to the backgrounds too, but it's refreshing nonetheless.  &quot;Surrender&quot; is a welcoming pop song that everyone should have heard it by now I hope.  Her english adaptions of a few songs turn out well, although you should buy the other versions to fully enjoy it.  There is one song that really stands out in my mind now because it is so surprising, &quot;I DO TO BE&quot; which is very well performed, totally different, new style (could not even recognize her with all the electronics in it) but sounds really good and catchy.  Most importantly, it suits her because when Celine Dion tried a new style, uuhh, it did not go.<br />Laura has grown professionally, and this CD is just another gift for the long time fans.  To end this, &quot;WITHOUT YOU&quot; follows her usual ballad style and she shows her powerful singing voice and the ranges she can obtain.  PERFECTION.  A DEFINITE CD to add to your Laura Collection and a for the new listener, you will love her!
B00005JKNF|4.0|I actually managed not to hear about this movie at all before I saw it. The title sounded dimly familiar. I know it won awards, but so do most movies starring Tom Hanks, and I'm sorry, but if that's the official arbiter of excellence, I'll just stay home. Anyway, I read the back of the DVD and figured it would be one of those films that I'd find boring on first viewing, yet gradually begin to appreciate if I bothered with it any further. <br />Well, it IS rather \\"dry.\\" I found it odd that Altman claims that the \\"F-word\\" was deliberately insinuated into the script a sufficient number of times to secure an R rating - supposedly to keep teenage boys with too much testosterone from seeing \\"Gosford Park.\\" I should think the testosterone itself would do the job. Nothing explodes in this film, there's nary a lick of that crazy rock music the kids like, nobody gets killed...oh wait, somebody does get killed, but even the murder scene is impossibly dull and boring. Bloodless, antiseptic, British. <br />This is an \\"adult\\" film in the true sense. This is a film about adult social politics and intrigue and gossip, about the strange edgy relationship between these indefatiguably haughty upper-crust aristocrats and the ever-complacent servants they depend upon for every least personal function, yet whom they openly revile as congenitally inferior. It would be rash to presume that the plush and pampered \\"Upstairs\\" life is really any easier psychologically than the cramped and calloused \\"Downstairs\\" life, however. \\"Gosford Park\\" is an interesting investigation of what happens when the constraints and tabus of this sort of caste system render the lives of everyone involved practically intolerable. The servants have been just as thoroughly conditioned to automatic submission as outright slaves. Their entire existence is drudgery; their only dignity is vicarious; they acquire the pretensions and snobberies of their masters and often turn viciously and hypocritically on one another. Yet the aristocrats themselves, who never have to flex a muscle for the most trifling amenity, have been driven by inevitable boredom and inertia to likewise ruthlessly intrigue against each other purely to while away the time and maintain the status-quo. Their insanely regulated and mannered lifestyle is as nigh impossible for them to embody as it is for their servants to set up. As such, everybody all-around is miserable, conspiratory, two-faced, paranoid, vindictive, jealous, insecure, chasing after an ideal which can never be realized. This social climate is the perfect breeding ground for every sort of moral dis-ease. <br />Nice craft on everybody's part really nails this home. Each actor - from Maggie Smith as an excruciatingly pompous, impudent, willfully-helpless old mummy of a Lady, to Sir William McCordle as a fat, nasty, overbearing slob, to Kristen Scott Thomas as a harsh, withering, jaded, manipulative Marlene Dietrich doppelganger - was fitted with an individual mic so that multiple simultaneous conversations in a scene could be recorded and then mixed to allow salient bits to come through in the final cut. This invests \\"Gosford Park\\" with a certain realism and allows the viewer to feel like an invisible voyeur wandering amongst these complicated proceedings and catching both relevant and irrelevant snippets. <br />Am I recommending it? I suppose I am. I did enjoy this film precisely because I'm the type that tends to get caught up in the minutiae of period customs and conventions, which are evidently rendered with exacting accuracy in \\"Gosford.\\" The documentaries accompanying the DVD are very interesting and informative in this vein.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I picked this cd up the morning it came out.  It rocks.<BR>Every track is solid.  This will be in my car cd player  for at least a month.
B00006690G|5.0|hey this dude is just awesome.he's bout the first rapper to be hilarious and make your head bang on the same songs.this is his best cd too.every track is tight and his lyrics make me crack up every time i look at em.top 3 tracks are white america,#3,and #13.his tracks with nate dogg and dre have crazy beats and rhymes.hey,you get it-eminem kicks ... and all you people who hate him just cos' he disses your favorite band,lighten up!i listen to limp bizkit and he threw a ew shotas at them on this album.so let your hair down and square dance to this tight cd!
B0000640SA|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a genius. It isn't that he took an obscure little short story by his brother and used its gimmick of a man with memory loss to amuse us enough into staying with it to the end. What he's done here is take a gimmick & imbue it with deeper meaning than it was meant to have. In doing so, he's elevated a simple film noir to the level of existentialist classic and simultaneously reinvented the rules of film noir, a<BR>once dead genre. <br />    Nolan was smart enough to not resolve the old cliche of the amnesia victim like movies of yore where they just suddenly remember everything & then it's O.K. From the begining of the movie we get clued in that Leonard Shelby is going to be permanently scarred, and so he comes to represent ALL that is wrong with forgetting, including our own absent mindedness. <br />    It is this hook of the \\"unreliable narrator\\" that makes the movie endlessly fascinating. We begin to look for the one true cause of Leonard's problem. Is it his injury? Is it his notes? Is it people misleading him? Is he purposely misleading himself?<BR>In Nolan's film they are all dependent on one another, and the movie becomes a Rorshach blot for ourselves, represented by Leonard's constantly looking into mirrors & coming to absolute conclusions that shatter his world farther. He can never accept the tatoos built up over time in lieu of memory without being reminded of his wife's murder (Jorja Fox, later of CSI. Don't blink or you won't catch her). Even \\"Teddy\\"/Lt. Gamel clues him to missing pages only to be blotted out like an incorrect note.<br />    Plotwise, this movie stands in league with Kurosawa's Rashomon, its complement. In Rashomon, we get an individual questioning witnesses brought forth to tell stories to provide for clues. In Memento, we get clues provided for stories to tell witnesses brought forth to question an individual. Both movies point fingers at relative & absolute judgement being nothing without each other in the pursuitof justice.<br />    Nolan has reinvigorated film noir as a style for illustrating<BR>modern ills. Rather than using the old black & white shadows & tilted camera angles, however, he uses all the opposite tones, light, colors: the character being sure & naive rather than cynical & doubtful, the loud enamels of modern hotel rooms, instant polaroids instead of newsprint, characters who consider Leonard a nuisance instead of a threat, etc. This isn't completely origional on Nolan's part, Tavernier used it in Coup De Torchon, but Chris realizes its potential here.<br />   This has become one of my top five films ever. It still affects me.<br />    What you get with this Limited Edition is Nolan's commentary (sadly left out of the origional) & other behind the scenes stuff. My favorite part of it is the packaging & the convoluted entry screens that play on the theme of a psychiatric file filled with tests of perception that you have to take to play the movie. Not for those who want instant gratification or are easily frustrated, but lots of fun to those of us who like to stoke the paranoid atmosphere of the movie before watching.<br />   Christopher Nolan is the new post modern Hitchcock.<br />   A classic in every sense.
B00006RU5B|5.0|. . .you'll like this CD.  If you care for one band and not the other, then you may not care for all of the songs.  \\"Cochise\\" demonstrates the best blend of Rage and Soundgarden's sound along with \\"Gasoline\\", \\"Set it Off\\", \\"Exploder\\", and \\"Light My Way\\".  This band should be commended for trying to do something special with this album and Rick Rubin does a great job on production. . .yet again.  If you like both of the bands that helped form Audioslave, you're in for a unique rock experience with both sides coming together on tracks like \\"I am the Highway\\" that don't really fit in either of their former band-molds.  Enjoy!
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is one of the few movies we have seen where we could not easily foretell the ending.  Kevin Spacey was terrific we thought and the revelation at the end was awesome.  The only problem is that once you've seen it, it will never be as good again the second time (though you can then spend your time looking for clues).  Still, a great time at the movies.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Get this CD now! Make sure to check out Rage Against the Machine CDs... Tom, Tim, and Brad from Rage are 3/4 of this band. This CD seriously rocks.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  The mystery here, which we think we figured out at the end, was brilliantly developed, step by backward step.  We thought the plot was thought provoking and the pace and action of the movie were as  driven as the lead character.
B0000020C4|5.0|The TAC is awesome! I think that having to sing live in front of an audience made the performers put more feeling into their songs, because this recording probably has the best acting of any Les Miserables album I've heard yet. The missing bits of music were somewhat irking, and might make it hard for you to follow the story if you're not familiar with it, but I guess you can't have everything. Loved the cast, except maybe for Judy Kuhn. She sounds way too old to be Cosette. I especially liked Ruthie Henshall as Fantine and Michael Maguire as Enjolras (though he still can't hold a candle to Anthony Warlow). The ending, with all the different Valjeans doing &quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?&quot; was a cool twist, too. If you plan to buy only one Les Miz album, I would advise you to make it this one.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I love this album. It is a more brutal version of Opeth, which is cool with me. However many long time Opeth fans are crying over this album being to brutal. To me that's ridicouls Opeth are an Extreme Metal band they're suposed to be Brutal.   Don't get me wrong this album still has as much creativity as any Opeth album. It just has the Brutality that Black Water Park Lacked, and I for one say thank god. Opeth still has the creavtie and soft elements that make them Opeth, but this time around there is a strong Brutal Death Metal skeleton holding everthing together, just like all Extreme Metal should have. To Opeth I say Bravo, to all those whining over this album being to brutal I say get real this is Extreme Matal at it's finest. If you don't like heavy music go listen to Briteny, or M+M you jackass
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is the bomb. He is the next Dave Matthews. I love DMB but you can actually understand all of John's lyrics. This cd has been looping in my car cd player for the last 10 months straight. No joke. This is the one cd worth getting.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I have been waiting for this one for awhile.  It's everything I hoped for and nothing what I expected. <br />I was figuring that the record was going to be very &quot;in your face&quot; like the single &quot;Cochise&quot; (not that it is a bad thing...hardly) but was shocked and impressed by the soulfulness and variety of their sound.  <br />I don't think this is going to please all those kiddies who ran out and bought their Che Guevara t-shirts, not having any clue who he was, after listening to RATM.  But you know...that may not be such a bad thing.<br />Between this and the new Queens Of The Stone Age record, this is turning out to be the best year in a looooong time for rock fans.<br />Thank you guys.
0380820846|4.0|This book was by far the best of the Bridgertons'.<BR>In fact, having read it before the others  made the rest seem a bit of a disappointment, but have-no-fear! It is great for multiple readings.<BR>The unlikely heroine made the book stand out amongst the crowd of &quot;simpering debutantes&quot; authors of the genre like to mock while simultaneously employing for use of the female lead. Penelope was not beautiful, not naive, not (too) young, and not an heiress. She was intelligent, awkward, and very funny. She is much easier for the average woman to identify with, I think- which leads me to wonder why more Regency authors don't take a hint. <BR>As for Colin, he was refreshing as well, especially for those who are as tired of the &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;enigmatic&quot; nobility. <BR>As one reviewer mentioned, the build-up between the two characters was probably the best aspect of the novel. I especially appreciated the fact that the novelist took time to establish a friendship and build-up to the romance. It made it more touching, and surprisingly steamier as well.<br />I definitely recommend this one-  even not-so-avid romance readers will appreciate the wit of Penelope and her alter ego.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is a concept album on the life of the first human clones.<br />Everything in its right place--<BR>everything has to be in order at the genetic level to produce the 26 clones, Kids A-Z. and a message from the scientists--sorry, kids, there will be some kinks to iron out in later clones, like there are only 2 colors in the clones' heads, they have extrasensitive taste centers (\\"yesterday, i woke up sucking a lemon\\" saying the air even tastes sour and lemony.)<br />kid a--<BR>the clones are born.

B00006RU5B|5.0|... Hopefully, this album will spark the ignition for rock and roll once again. Amazing...period. \\"Cochise\\", \\"Set It Off\\", and pretty much every track on this album is as intense as both Soundgarden and Rage were in their prospective era! Buy this CD...
B000006045|5.0|It took me until the new millenium (2000) to even begin to listening to trip hop but what I missed before that time I am now making up for.  The first time I listened to trip hop, I heard this entire album and liked maybe one song...however, as I've grown to listen to more trip hop and electronica, I came back to this album recently and found it's a very rare jewel.  This album is not necessarily for a newbie to trip hop because it is much denser than some of its counterparts.  The album first opens with &quot;Angel&quot;, a beat that just takes you in completely and sets the &quot;mood&quot; and followed by &quot;Rising Son&quot;, it makes a set that just makes you want to dance or do even more than that.  &quot;Teardrop&quot; is a good song but almost seems out of place following the first two tracks...might have been better towards the end of the album.  &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; is definately a song with tons and tons of complexity and it took me a long time to figure out the lyrics and some of the meanings behind it and it follows in the same seductive fashion as the first two tracks.  &quot;Exchange&quot; sounds a lot like Portishead, whom are good but not my fav either in trip hop, but &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; definately has musical complexities and is an amazing track.  &quot;Man Next Door&quot; is a good track as well but almost seems to get lost between &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; and &quot;Black Milk&quot;, a track only a Cocteau could sing perfectly and so inticingly...reminds me of Garbage's &quot;Milk&quot; but much darker and hungrier.  &quot;Mezzanine&quot; is definately a proposition song and talk about something anyone would take up upon hearing with the rhythmic beat throughout the track.  &quot;Group Four&quot; has the spy-like theme to it that just grabs you and also goes to primal need.  This CD is definately filled with awesome songs but it's also not for the faint of heart from the lust and ecstasy throughout the CD...but definately one ofthe best CDs ever produced.
0151008116|5.0|This book is one huge adventure into the life of seeking out. Not at all what it outwardly conveys, the theme is in fact our journey, what most people search out. Tells tales of who we are through characters other than humans. <br />Pi's life is changed in a ship sinking.<br />The ship wreck, reveals our first dive into life, the mix we suddenly become aware of and how we would like to meld in. The dive in can't be manipulated, however we can choose many different routes, even almost to the point of ignoring the journey we are on, a form of spiritual blindness is revealed.<br />We all seem to carry these thoughts around with us all our lives. this book offers real portals which a reader can take great advantage of.<br />As  far as writing style and editing, the book flows amazingly well, there are no characters or events in the book that can be forgotten or confused with, very clear throughout.<br />I have to say this is one of the most intelligent themes I have ever been able to comprehend, a similar book which should be read in conjunction with this is SB or God
B00003CX9W|3.0|Having lived for years with the very distorted audio of the VHS version of FANTASIA, I tried the 2000 release of the 60th Anniversary Special Edition of FANTASIA (1940), with its \\"completely restored\\" label.  <br />The original FANTASIA was allegedly recorded with \\"perfect\\" fidelity using an 8 channel optical process developed for FANTASIA called \\"Fantasound\\".  At some point, the original sound track was apparently transferred over telephone lines.  In 1955 a magnetic recording was made to save the deteriorating optical copy.  The results were bad, and a new sound track was made in the 1980's, but it lacked the synergism of the Stokowski orignal, so they reverted to a best effort cleanup of the magnetic copy of the original.  In 2000 a \\"complete\\" restoration was made of what sounds like the magnetic copy.<br />Even though the 2000 \\"restoration\\" of the original score is better than the earlier VHS version, it is still distorted enough in places, that it is hard to stick with it. There is a lot of what I would call \\"modulation\\" of volume between different passages and much outright distortion at higher volumes. The voices are clearer, but still fuzzy in places.<br />Probably no one really knows what FANTASIA sounded like at its Premier in 1940, but this wouldn't hack it today.<br />The visual images have held up better.  Good color, artistic originality that hasn't grown too old, and incredibly detailed animation.  <br />I won't say anything about Disney's self censorship of rereleases of its own products, except that it's obvious where this movie was altered since something like a digital zoom was used.<br />This is probably the best soundtrack we will see for FANTASIA (1940) because it doesn't appear to be winning any viewing contests.  <br />This movie may be listed for Kids.  It probably should be \\"Family\\", and a moderately liberal family at that.  There are devils, witches, breasts and skeletons, naked human images and implications about evolution to go along with the dancing hippos and abstract musical images.<br />Bottom line: buy this one if you have to choose from what's available today.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one of the few bands that has consistently put out good product since its inception in 1991, when its vocalist and guitarist decided to start a project dedicated to the theories of a mysterious text called The Joyful Guide to Lachrymology.  Their fourth effort (preceded by Aenima in 1996, Undertow in 1993, and the EP Opiate in 1992) manages to satisfy their fans' extremely high expectations and in the process, raise the bar once again for their contemporaries.   An album that plays well from start to finish without discernible flaw or break in mood, Lateralus conjures fond memories of the way Led Zeppelin's Presence flowed, and the of the sort of amazing extended-length atmospheric songs that Rush used to craft, such as \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\"  Actually, those who will try to categorise Tool can only fail-sure, they fall somewhere in the hard-rock-to-metal genre, but nothing can adequately describe the fragile combination of raw power and ethereal beauty that their music imparts.  Stop reading, stop pigeonholing, put on the headphones, and pump up the volume.  Rest assured, you'll reach all the right conclusions.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's latest studio album (but probably not his last, as late artists tend to release more than just one album for some reason) is a strong album that seemingly gets better track by track and with every listen. Lyrically, Harrison is in fine form as he mixes spirituality, social commentary, and his losing battle with cancer in an uplifting way that doesn't preachy, heavy-handed, or corny. The layers upon layers of gorgeous slide guitar helps out as well. It manages to overcome Jeff Lynne's glossy and crisp production which sounds a bit outdated. Thankfully, Lynne restrains a bit and lets Harrison and his guitar do the talking and the result is a fine record that ranks among his best solo albums. Now it's time for a box set and the rest of his albums remastered....
0953104907|3.0|The book in terms of organization and information is good. One of the biggest shortcoming of the book is that there are no dimensioned drawings or sketches. All the dimesions are sort of buried in the text. But the saying goes:&quot; a good picture is worth a thousend words.&quot; Mind you, there are a lot of pictures in the book, however, they seem to demonstrate rather trivial operation. For instance pages 86-87 there are 4 pictures; one showing the body being cut on band saw, another a hand holding a sand paper (only information one gets is &quot;a hand holding a sand paper&quot;) again another one of the guitar body in a semi finished state with the<BR>heading &quot;the body&quot; !!. I am still trying to find out locations of the pickups relative to the bridge. Or what effect it has on<BR>guitar if I chose on some arbitrary position (within reason ofcourse). Well it wouldn't be fair if I don't mention that I am<BR>a mechanical engineer. But I am a wood worker too. I don't think I would want to build a set of chairs and a breakfast table from<BR>pages and pages of &quot;descriptive&quot; instructions. A sketch would really go a long way, even if it is on a napkin.<BR>I was trying to answer a question in my own mind: &quot;Is the electrial guitar and purely electrial &quot;appliance&quot; or does the associated wood and other stuff adds value or quality to its performance ?&quot; Well according to Mr. Hiscock, the truth lies somewhere in between. Of the 218 pages of the book only about 27 are dedicated to what Mr. Hiscock calls &quot;electrikery&quot;.I don't know if Mr.Hiscock is convinced of what he is saying !!<BR>Again, assuming that it is a combination of the word &quot;electricity&quot; and &quot;trickery&quot;, one would find it very hard to locate any description of &quot;tricks&quot; that a professional guitar maker like Mr.Hiscock would know and would like to share with his readers.<br />And finally, the last question that lingers in my mind &quot; Whatthe heck is a &quot;woolly&quot; sound ?&quot;, that, Mr.Hiscock claims, comes from a strong pickup.
B00006RU5B|3.0|It's good, though it's not Badmotorfinger or Evil Empire.  It's<br />not even an idea of either.  It's nice to hear Chris wail<br />his heart out again...I am a fan of both, but more so<br />a fan of Chris Cornell...The music<br />is all 'RAGE',the vox are all 'SG' so it's pretty much what you<br />will expect to hear.  A few nice surprises are the ballads.<br />But fans of Temple Of The Dog or Chris' Euphoria Morning<br />will recognize this style. If you get a chance to listen before<br />you buy, I'd recommend that.
068484267X|5.0|I loved this book!  It is sometimes very painful to read, but the value is emmense.  It can be light-hearted on one page and then almost too painful to get through on the next, but it is always worth it!<BR>To me, the most important thing to remember here is that this is NOT fiction!  This man lived this childhood, and if he could survive and become successfull, I can certainly read about it.<BR>There is a great deal of value in reading how another can overcome the worst and triumph.  It gives anyone hope!
B00006RAKP|5.0|this album has all of his popular hits and singles from the beginning of his musical career and, boy, are they great to listen to. some i haven't heard in years. i won't mention all of the good/great songs because there are just too many and most people who are familiar with elton john's work already know most (or all) of them. so, with that said, the only other album you need by elton to have the &quot;ultimate&quot; collection is his 1971 album &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. Out of the 34 songs here, not one is from that album because none of the songs were hits. however, it's his best single album and it's unlike anything he ever sang about. it's a homage to the old west, gunfighters, soldiers, and hard-working farm families that is a unique treasure to discover and own for the rest of your life.
006441034X|5.0|Hilarious, unpredictable, and exciting; with unforgettable characters and a great scarecrow.  Not to mention the dog.<BR>One of Wynne Jones's best -- don't miss out!
B00006LSM3|5.0|God Bless George and keep him close to the heart of truth. The Quiet Beatle has said goodbye with an album that is every bit as remarkable as his first solo effort 30 years ago. The one least enchanted with being a Beatle and often relegated to secondary composer status, George eschewed all manner of ego centric efforts because he was ever and always focused on a truth more fundamental. Coupled with a brilliant sense of humour and an often brutal honesty, George always delivered the real deal. <br />This coda to a body of work that was always good and sometimes phenomenal deserves very high praise. Start to finish, the songs are terrific. Filled with his observations and sage admonitions, the man who wrote BEWARE OF DARKNESS opens up with ANY ROAD, a lighter take on the same theme. P2 is a brilliant Harrison ditty, like PIGGIES or CRACKERBOX PALACE. And then George sets about ripping your emotional guts out. LOOKING FOR MY LIFE, HIDDEN IN A CLOUD and the balance of the CD are as heart wrenching and honest an evaluation of a life as you'll ever hear anyone deliver. George is the anti-dote to Peter Gabriel. Great songs, exquisite guitar craft, and that voice that seemed to wobble at times and cajole and then offer some of the most incredibly beautiful love poems ever written are all in full display. His self deprecating gallows humour tackles BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA, compleat with killer ukelele runs. At times he references musical ideas from his canon. I swear I can almost hear the Beatle and solo tunes to which he briefly refers in his playing and chord structures. MAGWA BLUES is a sublime response to WHILE MY GUITAR. His observations sneak up on you, they always did. He was ever and always understating his case, all the more for its impact to live with you long after.<br />Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison have rendered George's demo tapes beautifully. Lynne restrains his ELO excesses to an absolute minimum, and Dhani has brought tremendous love and sympathy to his father's work. The old man would be proud. Liner notes bid farewell to Paul and Ringo. Jim Keltner and Jools Holland contribute perfectly, and the ending of the disc is absolutely, categorically, beautifully George. We're going to miss him.
0790743507|5.0|One of my all-time favourites.  Funny no matter how many times you've seen it.<BR>'Yes, yes, yes!'  'NO, NO, NO!'<BR>'Oh, Pierre, you SHOULDN'T have come!'
B00006AFF5|1.0|Okay, maybe I shouldn't comment on this edition, since it was last years edition, that I bought and was pleased with.  What I am displeased with is that one year later, we have another Deluxe edition, which is getting to be more than a little bit of overkill.  How many editions of a movie does Hollywood think we need to own? (Unless you're a collector of such things).  The same goes for all the third and fourth editions of movies that the Studios want to pick our pockets with.....365 days a year!
038542471X|5.0|I absolutely love The Client! It was the first Grisham that i ever read and it got me hooked!!! Absolutely a great read, I've read it 4 times!
B000002WYT|5.0|This was the first DMB CD I ever got, and I have to admit, I got it becuase I loved \\"Crash Into Me.\\"  For a long time, that and \\"So Much to Say\\" were the only songs I listened too.  Then, one day, a song came on and I left it one.  After hearing it, I was immediately hooked.  That song was \\"#41,\\" and it is now my favorite song of all time.  The CD is their funkiest, but at the same time, their most beautiful.  This song has some of the best melodies and sounds I have ever heard in a CD.  The music is magical, as are the lyrics (most notably on #41, Crash Into Me and Cry Freedom).  The CD is beuatiful and it contains the quote by which I live my life: \\"Eat, drink and be Merry.\\" (I wrote my college entrance essay about that quote.)<br />So Much to Say- (10 of 10)- I actually read a review on this page that criticized my favorite line in this song, \\"And my heaven is a nice house in the sky, got central heating, and I'm all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\"  I love this song so much.  It is one of the funkiest songs.  The music is funky, and the lyrics are too.  <br />Two Step- (11 of 10)- This is one of my favorite Dave songs of all time.  The lyrics are wonderful and the music is very clever and very fun to listen to.  If you like this song, listen to the version on \\"Listener Supported.\\"  This song is awesome, \\"life is short but sweet for certain...\\"<br />Crash Into Me- (11 of 10)- Once again, an all tiem favorite, with spectacular lyrics and wonderful, harmonous music.  \\"Oh I watch you htere through the window as I stare as you wear nothing but you wear it so well, tied up and twisted the way I'd like to be, for you, for me, come crash into me.\\"<br />Too Much- (10 of 10) By far their funkiest song, with a great beat and awseome lyrics.  \\"Ooh traffic jam, got more cars than the beach got sand, suck it up...\\"  This song is a great song.<br />#41- (12 of 10)- By far the best dave song of all time, in my opinion.  The lyrics are wonderful.  Pure magic.  The jam session in the end is spectacular.  The band is so talented in this song, and it is the strongest part of the CD.  \\"Why won't you ever be glad, it melts into wonder, I came in praying for you why won't you run into the rain and play, and let the tears splash all over you,\\" and \\"I wanted to stay, I wanted to play, I wanted to love you.\\"  The song is perfect, and it always picks me up on a bad day.  It is pure magic<br />Say Goodbye (9 of 10)- This song is spectacular and the transition from #41 into this song it wonderful.  This is such a good song with powerful lyrics, and it gives a happy take on saying goodbye.<br />Drive In, Drive Out (9 of 10)- This song is very fun to listen to.  The lyrics are funky, and the song is too.  It could be stronger, but, hey, there's not much you can do to a song this good.<br />Let You Down- (10 of 10)- This is a great song.  \\"I have no lid upon my head, and if I did, you can look inside and see what's on my mind.\\"  That is such an interesting line, and the first time I heard it I thought it was very cool.<br />Lie in Our Graves- (10 of 10)- This is a quintessentail Dave track.  It is a great song, and once again, the lyrics are amazong.  \\"I can't believe that we would lie in our graves dreamig of things that we might have been.\\"  That is a very powerful line, and along with a quote in \\"Tripping Billies\\" it's my favorite Dave quote.<br />Cry Freedom- (10 of 10)- This is one of Dave's best written songs.  The lyrics are magical and read like poetry, much like \\"Before These Crowded Streets'\\" \\"The Dreaming Tree.\\"  The song is wonderful.  \\"Hands and feet are all alike, but gold between divide us.  Hands and feet are all alike, but fear between divide us.\\"  <br />Tipping Billies (11 of 10)- The quintessestial Dave song.  It has awesome music, awesome lyrics, awesome solos (Boyd is awesome) and the best quote of all time (even though it's in the Bible, dave does something amazing to it.)  \\"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\\"  I wrote my college entrance essay about this song becuae it taught me how to live life to the fullest.  I love this song.<br />Proudest Monkey (9 of 10)- This is a good song, although it gets a little old, especially after the power of the song it follows.  In my opinion, if it were right after \\"Cry Freedom\\" I would probably listen to it more often.  Nevertheless, it is still a very good song, and the lyrics are just plain funky.  I love it.<br />I closing, this is probably my scond favorite Dave album.  I love it so much.  It has great music and great lyrics and great everything else.  I would reccomend this album to anyone.  This album opened the door for me and I have been addicted to DAv'e music ever since.  This is a great CD.
0151006903|4.0|I've been an unabashed fan of Eco's for nearly two decades now, and leapt into &quot;Baudolino&quot; enthusiastically, despite the sour taste that still lingers from &quot;Island of the Day Before.&quot;  Eco's gift is rare -- his erudition and his tangential details bring to vivid life not only far-away times and places, but also firmly root the reader in the psychological struggles of the protagonist.  &quot;The Name of the Rose,&quot; Eco's first and best novel, was a page-turning story and also made me feel the pressing weight of monastic politics.  &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; although set in the second half of the 20th century, convincingly sweeps the reader into a truly frightening dance with the occult.  All three readings of &quot;Foucault&quot; left me sleeping uneasily for several nights.<br />I thought of &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; as Eco's first real stumble.  Neither the story nor the atmosphere seemed remotely as compelling as in either of the two previous novels.<br />In many respects, &quot;Baudolino&quot; is a return to form.  The return isn't complete, however.  Twelfth-century Europe springs to life here, although it doesn't ring true -- there seems to be an overly-modern sensibility written into the dialogue and into the motivations of most characters.  For example, the medieval archetype of unrequited courtly love is reduced to an episode reminiscent of the nubile Stepmom from &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.&quot;  <br />Perhaps &quot;Baudolino's&quot; greatest accomplishment is the cool eye it casts toward the very modern notion that a well-crafted lie exposes a greater truth.  Baudolino's proclamation to that effect seems much more benign than, say, the claims of Tawana Brawley -- but is it really?
B00006LSM3|4.0|George had nearly completed this album at the time of his death so Jeff Lynn and his son Dhani completed some overdubs and production on it.  It's a great album filled with all the things you'd expect from George:  good melodies, lots of slide guitar, odd humorous lyrics and of course the sitar.  Stand out tracks are the Wilbury's sounding Any Road, the single Stuck Inside a Cloud and the ukulele drenched cover Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. Thanks for a parting shot worthy of your legacy George!
B000066C8G|4.0|Zoolander is one of those films where a silly sense of humour is required.  It's based on the New York fashion scene, with dimwitted model Ben Stiller being brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia.  This seems essential to the big fashion corporations as the prime minister has passed new laws to end the child labour on which their careers survive.  By taking such a fantastic concept the film enters into a fairly expansive parody of fashion and people's preoccupations with it.<br />Although there are several scenes of note, it is Stiller's over-the-top, exaggerated performance (complete with silly walk and frown) that make this movie worth seeing.  Whether he's pouting at the camera or prancing down the catwalk he is constantly funny.  In many ways the humour of the movie is like Charlie's Angels in that it never takes itself seriously.  This is a parody but in no way a serious one and isn't afraid to have a little bit of harmless, stupid fun on the way.  When Stiller's character insists to his roommates that to alleviate their sadness they go to have orance mochas and they all break into dopy grins, it's one of the movie's best moments.<br />Obviously this is a subject that's easy to lampoon but you can't help but love a film that's as earnest as this.  Like Josie And The Pussycats made a point of saturated media imagery, so does Zoolander with a huge amount of celebrity cameos from Winona Ryder to Gwen Stefani to Vince Vaughn.  Even Stiller's parents are there.  Yet even though this movie belongs to Stiller, there's a nice supporting role from Christine Taylor (Stiller's wife and previously seen in The Wedding Singer and The Craft).  Ultimately this is a movie that will make you feel good, but not in a sappy way, and thankfully even the happy conclusion has a fair bit of humour injected into it.  This isn't as good as the sharply observed Meet The Parents, but it's still one of Stiller's best.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Needless to say, this CD is a must-buy for anyone remotely interested in George's music. His slide guitar playing is very prominent and tastefully performed, as usual. <BR>The music resembles that contained on the Travelling Wilburys and Cloud Nine albums, and a few of the tracks (Stuck Inside a Cloud, Run So Far, and Never Get Over You) even sound like they could've come from his late-seventies/early-eighties period.<BR>The production by Jeff Lynne is very good overall, though it does venture into his trademark &quot;ELO-clone&quot; style in places.<BR>In all I highly recommend this release. If you like George, you'll be pleased with it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|My mom used to say that if Elvis ever pulled up next to her in traffic and said the word, she'd be gone....engine running, door open,...and she'd send for me later. While I knew she'd do it, I never really understood til I heard Norah Jones. While some complain about bland arrangements, I couldn't agree more with the way the tracks were done. The idea is to showcase the vocalist. Overdone arrangements and, shall I say, flashy videos and the same dance moves Michael Jackson did in Thriller, do not fill the bill. Shut it all off and listen to that voice. Go deep enough and the sheer sweetness of &quot;Seven Years&quot; becomes a tear-jerker. I don't even like all the tracks on greatest hits cd's, but I love every track on &quot;Come away...&quot;. It's no wonder people refer to fireplaces and wine. This cd is simply wonderful.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The new Audioslave album which dropped today is hands down the best album to come out this year. If you loved RATM, then you will love this. If you loved Soundgarden, then you will deffinately love this. i'm not surprised at how unbelievable this album is concidering the members that it is composed of. Literially every song rocks. If you had any doubts about this band i can assure you that you should not anymore. this record highly exceeded even my expectations, and i was the biggest RAGE fan i knew. YOU NEED THIS ALBUM!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Like many others, when Christina first arrived, I didn't give her much of a chance.  I liked \\"Genie in a Bottle,\\" but didn't think she would do much past that.  After all, there was already a Britney Spears on the scene.  However, Christina has something that Britney doesn't, the ability to actually sing.  So, I took a second listen to her, and realized that underneath the \\"pop\\" sound was a voice screaming for freedom.<br />In \\"Stripped,\\" Christina really breaks free of the pop realm.  She's soulful, beautiful, and brings life to each song she sings.  From \\"Walk Away\\" to \\"Beautiful\\" she brings the ballads to life, however keeps the tempo up with \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Infatuation.\\"  <br />Even if you are turned off by Christina's fashion style or previous pop music, give this album a chance.  You won't be disappointed.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I got the album at midnight when it was released and popped it into my cd player, i was amazed, even the demos that were on it had been changed and were a lot more incredible than the already amazing demos.  Chris has amzing vocals, tim is great on the bass, brad's new style of drum playing after reading those budhist books and watching ac/dc is awesome, and the things that tom does on the guitar are unbelievable.  after the second time of the chorus on nearly every song tom does a solo that is like nothing that has ever been heard before, its the best album i've heard in a long time!
0316666343|2.0|I couldn't wait to begin reading and had expectations of a great book, engrossing and compelling.  After only a few chapters, I realized this book wasn't going to be the &quot;literary find&quot; I was hoping for; I had to force myself to read a few chapters each evening and was determined to make it all the way through.  Needless to say, I was disappointed; I really can't find anything good to say about the book.  I feel as though I wasted many hours trudging through it with the hope that the ending would be worth the time.  Again, sorry - the ending was just as disappointing as the rest of the story.  Good thing I didn't pick it to read while on vacation. . .

B000001FE0|4.0|Reviewers have observed that this album is the Bee Gees' &quot;White Album.&quot; I beg to differ: it's really their &quot;Smiley Smile.&quot; The Odessa concept died in direct relation to the band's personal problems, in similar fashion to the Beach Boys and their legendary &quot;Smile&quot; album (the remnants of which were hastily thrown together as &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; after Brian Wilson could continue no further with it). At about the midpoint of the production of Odessa, things really started to go badly for the Bee Gees. Robin, looking for a way to have some creative control, left after it was decided Barry's &quot;First of May&quot; would make a better single than his &quot;Lamplight.&quot; That vital third seems, from listening, to be somewhat unenthusiastic about some of the tracks on this album.<br />The boys started recording with a grand design: a concept album made up of letters and observations written by an English sailor shipwrecked, stranded and alone aboard an unapproachable iceberg, doomed to wander the icy Black Sea for an indeterminate amount of time. The general feel of the album, I would speculate, is intact in the title track. A few compositions, like &quot;First of May,&quot; &quot;Seven Seas Symphony&quot; and &quot;You'll Never See My Face Again&quot; share the general atmosphere of that track and the lyrics fit thematically. But, as a result of discord within the band, the album was never finished as intended. Instead, current material seems to have been added to fill it out and it was released with its full potential unrealized.<br />If the band could have maintained the overall theme and mood as established in the core Odessa tracks, it could have been a near masterpiece. But the band was moving musically in a direction away from orchestral pop, a style they had developed via such seminal tracks as &quot;World&quot; and &quot;Cucumber Castle,&quot; from previous records, and mastered by the time of Odessa, embracing instead styleswhich were coming into fashion just then: country and folk rock. &quot;Marley Purt Drive&quot; provides the tell-tale link to such future soft-country albums as Life in a Tin Can. This didn't bode well: when the ground-breaking Main Course came out, with the blueprint of disco coded within, it was hoped this newest change in direction would light a fire under its flagging fan base (it did).<br />In any event... the true potential of the group lay on the control room floor in bits and pieces after the Odessa sessions.  Never again would an orchestra and a pop group meld in such a perfect way as on the remnant Odessa tracks (sorry Moody Blues fans).
B00006YXEK|4.0|There is no 'buyer beware' here.  Often with posthumous releases, you never know how 'ready' the artist had his work.  'Brainwashed' from the legendary George Harrison has everything but a George here on earth to promote it and possibly tour with it.  It's great, not 'All Things Must Pass' great, but great compared to much of what passes for music in 2002.  If you liked The Traveling Wilburys, you'll love it.  If you liked 'Cloud Nine' you'll love it -- in many ways it's 'Cloud' Part 2.  And if you loved him as a Beatle, there's no way you won't like it.  Lots of juicy slide guitar.  It's also very topical.  Stand out tracks are: the perfect album opener, the kicking \\"Any Road\\"; \\"Rising Sun\\", with its topical commentary; the weepy \\"Never Get Over You\\", and a personal favorite is his demo-sounding cover of \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\", reminding one of \\"For You Blue\\" from bygone days.  Jeff Lyne, of ELO fame/Wilburys, lends the production hand and, fortunately, doesn't make it into an ELO album.  It's 'solo George' pure and simple, and there will never be anything like it again.  As the sticker bluntly says: The Final Studio Album.  Thanks for leaving it behind, George.  A tip: spend the extra few bucks and get the enhanced/with DVD version rather than just the audio CD, absolutely beautifully packaged and makes a better 'gift' to give.
B00005B36H|5.0|Mere words can not describe the complexity and depth of this album. But one thing can be said out of certainty. The more you listen, the more you'll be captivated by it. This is the best TOOL album so far and i can not recommend it enough. You would be doing yourself a great disservice by not buying this. My favorite songs are The Grudge, The patient, Schism, ticks and leeches, parabol/a, Lateralus, and well simply all the rest. Just do yourself a huge favor and buy this album
B00006YXEK|5.0|We all know  That George Harrison passed last November, that he had a cache of songs that he was working on, that he left the job to his son Dhani to finish. Most often, posthumous releses are awful, rehases of greatest hits and/or record companies attempts to cash in on the recently departed. What a surpirse, shock, then, to encounter BRAINWASHED. It is a cliche` to say that it is{was}his best work since ALL THINGS MUST PASS,though it is also true.From any road,to the rocking P2 vatican blues,from the lovely elagaic looking for my life to Run dso far, Harrison found his voice, both literally and metaphorically at the end. The starined vocals present on the remix of MY SWEET LORD on the re-release of ATMP are gone, instead Harrison sounded less forced, his voice sounding steady and sure. His guitar playing ,especially his slide guitar, is in tio form. The Hoagy carmichael classic BEWTEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEPBLUE SEA gets a new re-working here, and it works very nicely. There is a polished tone to this rercording, unlike some of Harrisons other recent[if you call late 80's recent] work. In all, al must for the harrison fan, or any fan of good music. The special packake comes with a DVD on the amking of the albu, a poster of the album, a neat guitar pick[which my oldest son glommed] and a sticker, really a nice little package for a couple more bucks. First Rate music, great packaging, HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!
B00006YXEK|2.0|While the music on \\"Brainwashed\\" is charming (\\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" an \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" are highlights), the \\"extras\\" you get in this Special Edition are, in my opinion, hardly worth the extra cash.  The DVD contains only 1 track -- a 7-minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" look at the making of the record that barely says anything at all.  The \\"poster\\" is small and too delicate to do anything with.  The guitar pick is cool, though, but I have other guitar picks.  Unless I'm missing something, I hardly think the Special Edition is worth the extra hard-earned.
B000059HCN|5.0|Requiem for a Dream was not only a commentary on the chemical addiction which plague a minority of the US's population, but rather on the large scale addiction which plagues the country as a whole - television.  The woman was addicted to tv (there was not one moment in which my disbelief was not suspended - proof of the first calibre acting which swept this movie along).  She saw herself in a distorted light not only on the tv but in her waking world as well (when she was not sitting in front of her addiction) . . . the lengths to which she wanted to merge with that medium (dieting) are seen in many examples in our own waking worlds - how many people do we know who have eating disorders?  They are more out there than they let on.  TV is a drug.  Through excellent directing and surreal cinematography (sp?) the screen appeared to shriek at the viewer while the actors were tormented in their own fantasy worlds. TV and drugs are not community binding for the actors were protrayed as individuals with their own problems from which there was no support from any outside party. They were alienated from society, social rejects. (The authorities in the film never related to the characters as people, but rather as objects taking up space). In television there is a perfect world which does not reflect our waking realities, people watch it and yet, truly, what do they get from it?  A thirty-minute to an hour high from which they come down when they realize that they're hungry.  Is a sitcom truly different from heroin...or coke?  Which one is the more productive, the most longer lasting, the most worthy to society.<BR>None of them.<BR>Think about it.
0316666343|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Wonderful, detailed writing puts you in the scene. I truly felt for this fictional girl. The story of her family's breakdown and eventual rebuilding over a terrible event was very real - not overly dramatic, not glossed over. While the story centers on a young girl, every member of her family had an engrossing story. I was rooting for them all, and the ending is satisfying.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Even if you didn't take into consideration the traumatic and painful events of George Harrison's final years, one would hail Brainwashed as a masterful album, one of the best \\"solo Beatle\\" efforts ranking up there with George's own All Things Must Pass and Cloud Nine, Starr's Ringo, McCartney's Band On the Run, and Lennon's Imagine. <br />From the opening statement of \\"give me plenty of that guitar\\" on the Wilbury-esque \\"Any Road\\" to the final Hindu chant at the end of the title track and album, Brainwashed is an upbeat, introspective, and supremely poignant record. Expertly polished by longtime Harrison collaborator Jeff Lynne, and son Dhani, it is the clearest glimpse into the heart and soul of a reluctant rock legend.<br />The overall sound of the album is similar to Harrison's previous efforts with Lynne...the Traveling Wilburys, the new tracks from Best of Dark Horse, and Cloud Nine. And while there are no obvious singles that might crack the Top Ten, keep in mind that there weren't any hits from Sgt. Pepper's either.<br />Highlights include \\"Any Road\\", the acerbic \\"Vatican Blues\\" and \\"Brainwashed\\", and the lovely \\"Never Get Over You\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\". Though \\"Pisces Fish\\" is somewhat tedious, the album quickly regains its stride with the best original song on the album, \\"Rising Sun\\". Featuring strings, slide guitar and minor chords it's Harrison in top form, with a latter-day Beatles/All Things Must Pass aura. \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" has George playing the ukelele with Jools Holland on piano and Joe Brown on acoustic guitar. It might be the simplest, happiest moment of George's solo career, and brings the album to it's apex. As Dhani Harrison said, \\"it reeks of my dad\\", and this is certainly the image George wanted to leave us with...a regular guy, having fun fooling around with an old standard, an old ukelele, and some old friends. A fitting coda, indeed.
0446530573|5.0|This is not your average cookbook. Yes, it has great Italian dishes. But it also is written to be funny and entertaining. Which it is. My girlfriend wants me to cook for her. She figures since I'm Italian that I can cook. Fat Chance. My Mother can cook. So, I figured I'd better get this. If you like the show, and Italian food (And who doesn't like Italian food?), then this book is well worth it.<BR>--MICHAEL NASELLI--AUTHOR OF \\"THE LITTLE GUIDE TO HAPPINESS\\"
B00006YXEK|5.0|George Harrison has proven himself time and time again with his wonderful music.  \\"Brainwashed,\\" of which I own the Special Edition, follows that wonderful legacy.  Every song, from the single, \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud,\\" to the instrumental, \\"Marwa Blues,\\" stands out as a stellar track.  Let me rephrase myself: There's not one clinker on this album!!  And, the Special Edition is definately worth it for the collector's box, the normal edition packaging included, the guitar pick, and the poster.  The DVD is somewhat of a letdown.  It is only a seven minute-long documentary, but even that is very well done.  The video shows George in the studio and talking about his beliefs, and I must say, he didn't even look sick at all.  Hopefully, people will give this album the credit it deserves, and if you are a George Harrison fan, this album is perfect CD to complete your collection.
B0000065O1|5.0|I really haven't been able to find a workout tape like this one! I mean because it has a little for every part of the body.<br />This tape is about 64 minutes long, which after working out so long you get relieved it is over, because it really is the \\"next challenge\\"!!<br />The tape consists of: <BR>a warm up, about 2 mins of jumping (like rope jumping type jumps), 20mins of legs (lunges or all sorts, and some kicks) which has a lil water break every 4mins or so, then its abs 1, which has some crunches, then has some chest exercises, (which I've not been able to find any like these anywhere else), then its abs 2, then moves on to arms/shoulders/upper back for 10mins (and those hurt!), then moves on to abs 3, and continues to lower back, and cool down, et voila, you are done!!<br />Cindy is accompanied by a personal trainer, Rudu (i believe is his name) and hes always in the background always guiding Cindy and reminding her of proper form at all times and helping her count the sets.<br />I like this video because it has some aerobics, weight training, abs. It is a well-rounded tape, even though after a while the second half of the tape (from abs1 to lower back) it gets to be not so challenging, but you can always change the sets to suit your fitness level.<br />The background seems to be an empty loft, and the desert. The music is very soothing, (it has a Blondie song).<BR>I'd recommend this tape, it is nicely done.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was surprised by this album, I thought it was going to be dirty and trashy like Christina's appearance but it's not. This is a wonderful album and Christina dilivers it well. There are 16 songs on here and not one clucker like on most albums. \\"Dirrty\\" is a good song but does not ever tell you of what the album is about at all, there are many different styles of music and some very beautiful arraingments. \\"Soar\\" is one of my favoirte tracks, it's inspirational and fun to listen to. It's surprising how much a person can change and grow in the course of 3 years but Christina did that and we are left with a work of art for someone like of her abilites. \\"Stripped\\" isn't just about sex, it's about growth and love and finding inner strength, it's a must have for anyone who likes good music. I think that you will be pleasently surprised.
B000002513|2.0|Sure, Rosilita is a fun tune, but nothing here compares to the Bruce of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Nebraska, or Tunnel of Love.  If you already own all of those, though, this is a cheaper Bruce-dose than The River or Human Touch, and has about the same percentage of great songs.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Co-writting a lot of the tracks on this album Britney takes her music in a more personal (while remaining pop and a bit impersonal) direction. It all kicks off with the song about 'music' ;) \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" which is a fun song to just dance to. This album has classic Britney \\"Anticipating\\" and new Britney \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" and both are very welcomed. \\"Anticipating\\" has to be my favorite track on the album, it's fun, it's light, it's dance, it's dirty (just look at the lyrics). This is her best album and I would (since it's gonna happen anyway) compair this to Madonna's classic album \\"True Blue\\" for those of you familiar with that album. I say pick this one up.
B00006YXEK|5.0|I expected to be disappointed with this CD because Harrison's past efforts have been spotty with a few gems scattered here and there. I was pleased to find that I enjoyed 95% of this CD. And the more I listen to it the more I like it. The tone is mellow throughout with beautifully proficient slide guitar work used to great effect and a nice bit of Dobro on the blusy Rocking Chair in Hawaii. I especially like the instrumental Marwa Blues and Stuck Inside a Cloud and Pisces fish, but then I'm getting mellower as I get older. The more up-tempo tunes like Any Road and Brainwashed bookend the collection.<BR>The deluxe box is the way to go for true George fans. The packaging is nice with a small poster with the \\"dummy\\" cover photo on one side and a black & white of George on the other side. A round dark horse records sticker and a guitar pick with his gold imbedded signature on it that mad me wonder if this was the actual weight of pick he preferred. The DVD clocked in a little short. I wish they would have included more of the interviews with Harrison that they gave us snippets of. Just the same it was nice to see him in such a jovial mood and the comments of Dhani, Jeff Lynn and others about the recording and mixing of the CD.Thankfully Lynn tred lightly in most places. <BR>Peace!
B000002NJS|5.0|Upon my first listen of Madonna's Ray Of Light I loved the album.  It wasn't like any other album listening experiance I'd ever had before, it's easy to say that this is my #1 favorite album of all time.<BR>Madonna is on a journey in this album and she takes you with her, she's looking for love, she's found the love of her life in her daughter, she's trying to recount her life and she shows you well. While &quot;Material Girl&quot; was about posessions you now get the anit-&quot;Material Girl&quot; in &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; a fun dance track that is not lacking in depth and you really can understand what Madonna is talking about in this. &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; is one of the best tracks on it with it's dance beats and it's faith inducing lyrics, I would have to say that my favorite track besides the title track would be &quot;Skin&quot; it's just simply wonderful to listen to. All the songs on here complete the album and without even one of them the album would not be the same. This is a woman in the throws of change and a spiritual awakening and she takes you with her and you have fun on the way.
B00003CXDD|3.0|Like most George Lucas projects, WILLOW has a lot of elements in it that feel very familiar. As with the STAR WARS movies (drawn from the FLASH GORDON serials, Jack Kirby's \\"New Gods\\" comics, the King Arthur legends, Doc Smith's LENSMAN novels, Kurosawa's samurai films, the WWII movie THE DAMBUSTERS, Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" books, and so forth) WILLOW \\"pays homage\\" to a herd of sources, such as Tolkien, the Moses and/or Jesus birth legends, Tolkien, Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, and PETER PAN adaptations, Tolkien, Swift's GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, Tolkien, L. Frank Baum's \\"Oz\\" books, Tolkien, and his own initial STAR WARS trilogy. Oh, and Tolkien. Unlike the first couple of STAR WARS movies, WILLOW fails to grow into anything more organic than the sum of its many parts, remaining to the end a handsomely mounted mishmash of fantasy cliches, directed with reasonable efficiency by former AMERICAN GRAFFITI star and HAPPY DAYS survivor Ron Howard.<BR> So, why three stars? It's not easy to explain, even to myself. Frankly, I like the movie better than it deserves to be liked. Warwick Davis is appealingly gentle as Willow, and Jean Marsh has fun as Bavmorda, a.k.a. the Wicked Queen from Disney's SNOW WHITE, curling her lip and cackling hatefully. The two brownies, Lenny and Squiggy, are pretty funny, and Billy Barty has the best line in the movie (\\"Ignore the bird; follow the river!\\"). Some of the FX are impressive, not surprisingly, as they're the only things Lucas has really put any effort into since the early eighties. There's an enjoyable wizard's duel at the climax, during which, in a great down-to-earth moment, the aged sorceress Fin Raziel abandons magic and resorts to punching Bavmorda in the face repeatedly; there's also a two-headed dragon that's so stupid it manages to blow one of its own heads off. Occasionally the movie is unintentionally funny. The beautiful Joanne Whalley, cast as Bavmorda's supposedly menacing soldier-daugter Sorsha, wears a suit of black armor that seems to be three of four sizes too big for her; she looks exactly like Darth Vader's cute little daughter playing dress-up in Daddy's clothes. There's further costume humor later when Val Kilmer, as Han Solo wannabe Madmartigan, briefly dons a plumed helmet that resembles a huge Christmas ornament. Kilmer also does a drag routine that manages to get a laugh precisely because it's so embarrasingly corny; the fact that the filmmakers thought that it was funny turns out to be funny in itself. And then there are all those pigs. In fact, WILLOW is significantly more entertaining than, say, petrified duds like the two (so far) STAR WARS prequels, not to mention Ron Howard's holiday abomination HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS. When WILLOW was initially released, the pretentious Lucasfilm hype that accompanied it was enough to skew one's judgement; George, we were pompously told, had \\"studied myths from around the world before defining WILLOW to his satisfaction.\\" Yeah, right. And Tolkien. He also claimed that it was \\"a pure fantasy that came right out of my psyche\\". As Pauline Kael wrote, \\"Maybe only a movie mogul can believe that he's the source of the world's treasury of legends and movies\\". Now that some time has passed, and having seen Lucas virtually lose touch with the very concepts of storytelling and drama, WILLOW looks pretty watchable now; a first-rate guilty pleasure, if nothing else.
0920668364|5.0|Of the books on our family shelf, this is one that will never grow tiring ... and one that we will never outgrow.<br />This is heartwarming but simple story of a mother's love for her son and how it endures, overshadowing the trials and tribulations of each stage of \\"boyhood.\\"  Each night, she rocks her child and sings her love to him softly - <br />I'll love you forever<BR>I'll like you for always<BR>As long as I'm living<BR>My baby you'll be<br />Though her son grows up and moves out on his own, her love for him doesn't dim and she sneaks over to his house late at night to croon to him.  <br />When he has a child of his own, he finds himself rocking his child and softly singing the same song, his mother's love flowing down through the generations.<br />And finally, when his mother is too old to care for herself, the story comes full circle as the boy gathers his mother into his arms and rocks her gently, softly murmuring the song which so effectively expresses the love that has bound them together.<br />A word of warning ... after all these years of reading this story, it's still not possible to get to the end without tears welling in my eyes...keep the Kleenex close by.
0783229526|5.0|Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is without a doubt the greatest dark comedy of all time. This is no joke, this film is absolutely flawless. I found myself at times laughing so hard it was all I could do to catch my breath. The picture was directed brilliantly by Terry Gillam and the casting was perfect. Johnny Depp play Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke. A reporter whom must go to Las Vegas for the weekend to write a column on a race being held. Along side him is his \\"Samoan\\" attorney Dr. Gonzo. And off the pair goes to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs. As Raoul describes \\"two bags of grass, four hits of sunshine acid, a quart of rum, a quart of tequilla, a mass collection of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, twenty-five pellets of mescaline and a pint of raw ether\\". This begins the wildest trip in cinematic history. Before they even arrive to Vegas, Raoul has snorted ether, smoked some weed and done two hits of sunshine acid. His lawyer the \\"samoan\\" has snorted ether, snorted cocaine and eat some mescaline. Thus ensues the two into a nightmarish \\"trip\\" that leads them to the wildest weekend in Vegas...EVER! A must have for fans of the late 60's and early 70's...if you know what I mean. Don't forget to purchase the 2-disc criterion collection 1/8! The DVD will contain both the theatrical version and an unrated version of the film!
B00005NOOH|5.0|Factual, unbiased, bursting with rich historical detail, beautifully directed and peerlessly narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier; this is the definitive WW2 documentary series. Made in the 1970s it contains many, many excellent interviews with people from both sides who actually took part in he war which provide superb insight into the events being documented. The World At War is a long series but necessarily so - no consideration is missed during the course of its many hours which deliver coverage of the build-up to war, the execution of the war and its aftermath in terms of its effect on both military and civilian populations and from the perspective of all the major participant nations in both political and military terms. Not merely excellent in content, The World At War is also a flawlessly crafted piece of television - images and sound (allowing for its date of production and the inclusion of many archive clips) are excellent as are the score, script and narration - Laurence Olivier really does do a great job.  To conclude - I can not recommend The World At War enough. If you are interested in the genre or a student of 20th century history then you should buy it: you will not regret it. If you consider the hours-of-viewing to price ratio it is also pretty good value to..
0792841050|2.0|The reason for the rateing is that I thought that this movie came in color and when it arrived to my home it was in black and white. Cna someone there tell me does this come in color as while if so please give me a price. Other then that I really enjoyed the movie.
6305508550|5.0|This movie has a great, subtle pace that for the most part doesn't try to hit you over the head with the comedy (but don't worry, it's hilarious). It's really nice, and fun to watch. I've seen it countless times and reading these reviews just makes me want to watch it again.<br />The movie's got some really great lines you'll probably find yourself saying here and there, and discovering unexpected Office Space fans around you in the process.<br />And if for nothing else, you've got to watch it to see Lumbergh. A truly great character and truly a great performance by Gary Cole.
B00006RU5B|5.0|For the most part this album sounds like Rage Against the Machine minus LaRocha +Cornell.  There are a couple of tracks that sound like Cornell solo album Euphoria Morning like &quot;I am a Highway&quot;.  I always believed that Rage Against the Machine was missing a good vocalist, maybe they finally found one.
0316096199|4.0|I read Sebold's The Lovely Bones before I read this.  I was very anxious to hear the real life story of the author's real life rape and how it affected her life.  I was not surprised to find that, like The Lovely Bones, Alice Sebold knows how to write...and she does it well!<br />The rape description and courtroom drama are extremely gripping.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  I also found her life after the rape was described so well and deeply touched me.  I had never thought much about how rape may affect someone in their later years, and Sebold beautifully describes every detail.
B00005U122|5.0|Just a few words... I saw this dvd with a friend who is a<BR>black metal fan ( no comments ). He got shocked :-) Now when<BR>the discussion comes to music he says \\"When are we gonna see <BR>it again? PLZ!\\" :-) The best word to describe this dvd is<BR>FEELING. And the last song ( a new one i think ) \\"Each small<BR>candle\\" is perfect. Whether you are a Pink Floyd / Roger Waters<BR>fan or not, just buy it.
0521397812|4.0|So, I was recommended this book, along with a couple dozen others, from my TESOL class.  I FINALLY bought it here in Seoul and I'm happy to have the help with the ideas.  Teachers have to be creative but it's nice to have the help.  The only thing that I might have liked to see (and this is just to spoil me) is have the book broken down into their categories in the front of the book, instead of just the index...and by level.  I still highly recommend the book because I don't see myself living without it again.
B00006YXEK|5.0|One year after his death, George Harrison's final recording sessions are issued.  Frankly, I was expecting a somewhat patchwork album with seams showing, given George's musical inactivity in recent years, his lack of attention to current pop music trends, and his serious health problems.  Yet after hearing BRAINWASHED I'm convinced that George left us with his strongest, most consistent solo work since ALL THINGS MUST PASS.  What immediately grabs the listener is that George sounds rejuvenated and energetic throughout the album--not only his singing, but also his instrumental work.  Furthermore, his songwriting is recharged, offering tunes with attractive hooks and lyrics reflective of George's spiritual vision.  If anything his songwriting is positively rather than negatively affected by the long layoff...while some tracks stand out more than others, there are no weak spots on BRAINWASHED.  <br />Jeff Lynne and George's son Dhani co-produced the album: George's keep-it-basic musical approach is maintained throughout, with little in the way of outside influences or contemporary musical strains (fortunately the results sound timeless, not dated).  The tablas that enter on the closing title track add some variables to the mix...probably the one thing I would have liked to hear more of would be for a bit more usage of such outside elements, but that is a minor point.  The bottom line is that BRAINWASHED is an important work not only from a post-Beatles perspective, but its musical integrity and spiritual vibe may make a considerable impression on the contemporary music scene that George admittedly had little affinity for.       <br />P.S., Although only 7 minutes in length, the bonus DVD will be of considerable interest to even casual fans.  It is a mini-documentary of the BRAINWASHED sessions, featuring footage and interviews with George, Dhani, and Lynne.  Although in the midst of the health problems that took his life, George seems happy and in a musically-productive state-of-mind.  My only regret with this DVD is that the documentary wasn't longer, with more extensive musical footage.
B00006M183|5.0|After two long years of musical pollutants of the rock world, such as Creed and Linkin Farce, Pearl Jam is back with a new album to set things straight!  The last album Binaural, although very good, lacked any sense of consistency, and many of the songs seemed rushed.  Not so with this one.  Riot Act is easily PJ's best album since Vitalogy, containing some of the best songwriting in years.  This album is definetely a lot rockier than Binaural, &quot;Save You&quot; is the heaviest and angriest song Vedder's written since &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;.  Even some of the slower numbers rock, like the great &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, and the single &quot;I Am Mine&quot;.  &quot;You Are&quot; contains an unusual but awesome funk effect that sounds incredible.  &quot;All or None&quot; is the best closer on a PJ album since &quot;Immortality&quot; from Vitalogy, very sincere and passionate.  The only mistep is the sappy &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;, a boring ballad that seems to drone on forever.  Aside from that, this is Definetely one of the best albums of this pitiful musical year, don't miss it.  If you're new to PJ, get the classics Ten and Vitalogy first.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|My nearly three-year-old saw the commercial for this movie and flipped!  She was so excited when I brought it home.  Need I tell you it's been playing DAILY at my house?  She never seems to get bored with E.T. and \\"the boy\\"!  Fortunately, it's a classic movie that is also adult-friendly.
B00006YXEK|3.0|A typical George Harrison album. He doesn't make music to make money. He makes music to make music. Although not as memorable as Cloud Nine, \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\" Between the Devil and Deep Blue Sea\\" are two songs that stand out. In \\"Brainwashed\\" the sound of Harrison's haunting guitars are all over the place;even though his son also played some guitars. Considering what was going on through his life at time of these recordings these songs can be very moving. The songs come deep within Harrison. It is as close as you can get to George Harrison without having met him in person. Jeff Lynne and Harrison's son Dhani did a remarkable job of preserving George Harrison's musical essence.
B000000XCK|3.0|I really like CCR's catchy old songs about bayous, trains, and graveyards, but for my taste their albums progressively went downhill, and were close to the bottom in several respects with all albums from 1970 on, which includes &quot;Willy And The Poor Boys,&quot; this one (from December 1970), and &quot;Mardi Gras.&quot; This was in stark contrast to their earlier bayou era albums, where almost every song was a hit. However, although these later albums were weak in catchy songwriting and southern imagery, they were strong in other aspects. &quot;Pagan Baby,&quot; although repetetive and uninteresting, is fairly intense, and has some of Fogerty's fastest lead guitar lines. &quot;Born To Move,&quot; despite being very un-Creedence in style, is a surprisingly good jam with organ that sounds a bit like Santana, Eddie Harris, or Ten Years After. &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot; is also very un-Creedence and has some interesting speeded up guitars and organ reminiscent of Yes. However, despite a promising start, it winds down without reaching any climax. The remaining songs are all unnoteworthy, in my opinion. I never liked the biggest hit from this album &quot;Have You Ever Seen The Rain?&quot; due to the ballad's vocals being raised to a high key where they distort, and its slow, boring chord progression. In summary, I liked the playing and instruments on this album, but the songwriting just doesn't cut it. They should've focused more on good songwriting, regardless of style, instead of getting distracted by showing off how many instruments they could play. Hell, if they'd pursued their Santana and Yes directions that they started on this album, they might've reached unprecedented new heights instead of disbanding, although their contract with Fantasy Records may well have been hurting the band at this point, sad to say.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Five years after the breakup of Soundgarden and three years after the release of Euphoria Morning, Chris Cornell is back. But now he is backed by one of the strongest groove bands in rock music today, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford, who were formerly in the band Rage Against The Machine. This unexpected collaboration has formed an extremely strong, new style. Their sound ranges from atmospheric, with Cornell singing resplendant melodies(of haunting themes), backed by a Morello's trippy, delay soaked guitar, to bone-crushingly heavy. Cornell and Morello have a sonic connection in which the vocals and guitar seem to be one entity, moving together, soaring and decending, screaming and whispering. All the time, Tim and Brad never fail to lay down a rock solid groove. In my opinion, this is the best album of the year. If you don't own it yet, buy it! It is the essential rock album of 2002.
0790731452|4.0|This movie was not based written as a spoof for any movie that was released before it. This movie was base on an underground card collection that told the graphic and demented story of Martians who came to earth to do one thing. That thing is clearly represented in this film, and as far as Burton goes, I feel none could have done it better. The only thing this movie lacks is the (artistically) odd shapes and lines usually found in Tim's artwork (see the \\"melancholy death of oyster boy and other tales\\") and movies such as \\"Beatlejuice\\" and \\"Nightmare B4 Xmas.\\"
B00006RU5B|4.0|Let's get one thing straight before you buy this cd. This is NOT Rage against the machine, if you are expecting heavy guitar riffs and hard rap vocals, prepare to be disappointed. That said, this is an excellent cd. It is very melodic and well written, and Chris Cornell has an amazing voice. Tom Morello, Brad Wilks, and Tim Comerford are as solid as ever, and some of Tom's solos are incredible. The best tracks are Cochise, Gasoline, I am the Highway, and Set it off, but all the tracks are good. I think i still like Rage a little bit better, but this is still worth buying for sure!
B00006LSM3|4.0|Jeff Lynne has been very apologetic about fleshing out these recordings to make the CD more accessible to the masses. I think Jeff should be commended on his efforts.  The typical Jeff Lynne hallmarks are all present that were on the highly successful \\"Cloud 9\\" album in 1987.  I am glad that Jeff has brightened the songs a bit and made them more commercial and hopefully more accessible to the masses. This CD, on first listen, seem to be the natural progressor to \\"Cloud 9.\\"<br />This is pretty typical George fare and any Hari fan will be pleasantly surprised I should think.  It is just a damn shame that George didn't put more out between 1987 and his premature demise last year.  All the Hari trademarks from his solo post-Fabs career are present on this CD.  I hear tidbits that make me smile when they make me think of earlier George solo and Beatle work (trainspotters only).  George's distinctive slide work is all over this CD and indeed welcomed.<br />Any Hari fan has already heard the old standard, \\"The Devil and The Deep Blue See\\" which was actually used years ago on Derek Taylor's \\"All Those Years Ago\\" BBC special/video.  Great song with Hari in fine form on the ukele.<br />The whole CD is far more uplifting and bright than I had anticipated.  George seemed a bit dogged by it all towards the end and perhaps even a bit bitter.<br />Hari has left this world with his last statement and it is well worth listening to even if you never were a Beatles fan.<br />The Peace shines through and we are all a little less without Hari around.
B00006V9A0|1.0|This album is a waste of money for true nirvana fans who already own all their cds. To get the unreleased track, you only need to buy the single, and Ta-Da! Your collection is complete. This album is a waste of money. Courtney Love is the devil. If it wasn't for her, this album would have been released long ago, not to mention that Kurt would have lived longer to keep producing more music.
B00006YXEK|5.0|It's all here--the pop songs with a point like Any Road, the left turns like Rocking Chair in Hawaii, a cautionary tale in Rising Sun, borderline silliness in a cover of The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (and I like the ukulele very much), and spiritual statements like Brainwashed.  That's just an overview,  I haven't even got to the bonus disk yet.<br />Oh, yes, this a George Harrison album so good you've got to smile despite what we seemed to have lost.  It sounds like a George Harrison (and not a Jeff Lynne exclusive) with Mr. Harrison in full command.<br />To all involved, thank you.
B00006YXEK|3.0|since long before his death, we've been anticipating this album.  It's great to finally have it<br />honestly, I'm more a fan of George's earlier solo work;  haven't really gotten into anything since Dark Horse, other than select tracks.  Brainwashed fits right in with the albums he's released since then, in my opinion.  Nothing terrible about any of the album;  it's just that very little of it stands out much<br />the first few tracks on the album all reflect George's spiritual interests.  The music and lyrics don't mean much to me, other than the fact that it's George playing.  It's also a treat to hear George's son Dhani play and sing alongside his father<br />the tracks that I enjoyed the most were the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", \\"Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea\\", and \\"Rocking Chair In Hawaii\\".  'Rocking Chair' is a fun song, not too fast or slow, just a treat to listen to.  'Deep Blue Sea' features George on ukulele and is also fun.  And \\"Marwa Blues\\" is just beautiful.<br />the special edition includes a DVD of the making of the album, a poster, a Dark Horse sticker, and a George Harrison guitar pick (pretty cool).<br />Honestly, I don't see myself playing the CD as much as my Beatles CDs or even any other Harrison-solo CD, but just having a copy of the last album George Harrison ever recorded makes it a special addition to my collection
0800132343|2.0|\\"Das Boot\\" isn't a bad movie but it's not the cinematic tour-de-force as some have suggested. \\"Das Boot\\" does have its moments of intense drama but the problem is, they're only moments. The rest of the film consists of long, drawn-out scenes with a lot of nautical dialogue and political rhetoric. Yawn! I give \\"Das Boot\\" high marks for its realism and technical detail. Unfortunately, there's not enough action to hold the viewer's interest for any length of time, which is something to consider since \\"Das Boot\\" runs well over three hours. If you're looking for a good war movie to add to your video/DVD collection, I would recommend \\"Stalingrad\\" or \\"Cross of Iron\\" instead.
6304698658|5.0|We have a collection of our favorite Christmas films on DVD and this is one of them.  Very funny, somewhat irreverant, but tires you out from laughing.  Highly recommended!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This sets the standard by which all war movies will forever be measured. The only danger is that someday someone will say, as has been said of Shakespeare, &quot;Band of Brothers is all cliche,&quot; forgetting that it was the original from which the cliche came.<br />One complaint I have heard is that the men seem all alike in their uniforms, dirt, and blood. But as you watch the entire series and watch it again the subtleties become readily apparent. <br />Finally, it is difficult not to fall in love with Winters, a reaction I shared with many female friends.
0385505833|5.0|I wanted to read this book just because the title was intriguing alone.  I've had thoughts of what it would be like to skip Christmas instead of going through all of the things we all do - year after year.  Grisham's writing style had me laughing out loud several times.  It almost brought me to tears too.  I read the book over the course of a few short plane flights and probably could've read the whole thing in a few uninterrupted hours.  I wish it was longer - only because I enjoyed it so much.
B00006YXEK|5.0|This special edition of the final George Harrison album is a must for the artist's fans.  The DVD--while a bit on the short side--shows exclusive interviews with the reclusive ex-Beatle, son Dhani, and producer Jeff Lynne.  Clips of live performances and George's talking about life, faith, and music make the DVD a welcome addition to any fan's library.<br />Included also in the attractive black case are the album (of course), a small poster with the album cover on one side and a black-and-white of George on the other, a vinyl stiker of the Dark Horse records logo, and a guitar pick stamped with George's signature.  <br />If you are a major fan of George Harrison, you may want to pick up this special edition of his final album.  Otherwise, the CD itself is more affordable.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I have to admit..when I first heard about ex-soundgarden singer chris cornell collaborating with the surviving members of rage I was a little skeptical. For some reason I pictured Cornell singing is a rap style pattern like Zach Del a Rocha used to do with rage(don't ask)so I think that was why I was skeptical..then I heard their single Cochise and I was totally blown away. It sounded like rage with a better singer. Now don't get me wrong..I have been a huge rage fan for years but hearing cornell sing for them just makes you wanna feel like saying..the hell with rage..as bad as that might sound. I went and got this cd the first day it came out and listened to it front and back not being bored by one song. Every song on this album is strong..the texture and uniqueness of Tom Morello's guitar playing is superb. He uses a lot of different elements with his guitar(even something he never did with rage..an acoustic sound)plus the rhythem section couldn't be better. I really can't give a favorite song because 1-14 are my favorites..I must say that the long wait for this cd payed off and I would recommend this album to anyone who is soooooo sick of the music scene nowadays, especially with the whole rap scene that I'm getting so sick of. This is just a great rock album...good music...great lyrics..great everything. I would definetly vote this album to be album of the year. Don't wait any longer..GO GET THIS ALBUM NOW!
B00006LSM3|5.0|This posthumous release is a solid rock album.  The twelve tracks here (though Amazon's listing is missing #3 \\"Pisces Fish\\") are all strong songs.  Of course, George always took his time releasing albums (almost fifteen years since his last studio album).  <br />The album itself is mostly upbeat, with George playing the moving guitar licks for which he is famous.  His voice--though weakened over the years--still imparts wisdom, dark humor, and spiritual guidance, all rolled into one 48 minute album.<br />The Wilbury influence is heavy on this album.  Jeff Lynne's production is never hard to miss.  The jangle of George's twelve string guitars may call to mind Tom Petty, while his voice now more resembles Bob Dylan than his earlier solo outings.<br />In short, this is a good album from a legendary musician.  If you like George's other solo stuff or his work with the Beatles, you should also enjoy this album.  I especially like the tracks \\"Looking for My Life,\\" \\"Stuck in a Cloud,\\" and \\"Brainwashed.\\"
B00002MZ12|5.0|what can i say... this is the best cd ive ever heard. alanis sings her best songs from her cds plus an extra 4. my favorite song on it is These are the thoughts. i can listen to that song forever, its so beautiful; &quot;why do I feel cellularly alone? am I<BR>supposed to live in this crazy city? can blindly continued fear-<BR>induced regurgitated life-denying tradition be overcome?&quot;. beautiful songs like that and powerful songs like you outta know and joining you and uninvited make this cd amazing. king of pain is an exelent cover for her to do, she fits the song so well.. this is a must buy for anyone and everyone. live a little, and buy this cd now!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I was prepared to blast the mighty Spielberg for his useless<BR>PC changes to the original E.T. The digitally altered E.T. isn't bad - it's just different, and I don't want different. When they announced the original version would only be available in a ... box set, I was depressed. ... Both versions look wonderful, and it was a bit shocking to think it has been 20 years since the 18 year old version of me watched this movie 5 times in the summer of 1982. I laughed, I was moved and thrilled by the expert and deft touches<BR>that keep the magic real for the entire movie. Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore still give 2 of the best kid performances ever.<BR>E.T. gives a pretty excellent performance too. John Williams' music is still wonderful. It is nice to just see E.T. the movie instead of E.T. the phenomenon. If you liked it back then, get the DVD now.
B00006M183|4.0|It's now common knowledge that Pearl Jam's fall from superstardom was mostly self-engineered, as they wanted to just make music and have people judge the music on its own merits, and to stop obsessing with Eddie Vedder's hairstyle and other inane aspects of the band's personal lives. Hence Pearl Jam may be the world's only band made up entirely of hermits. I bet that 75% of the grunge fans who worshipped the band in the glory days aren't even aware that they're still releasing new albums regularly. PJ surely don't care if you wish they still sounded like &quot;Even Flow&quot; - besides, if you were in your late 30's would you want to be judged forever on something you did back when you were 26? Therefore modern Pearl Jam albums are meant for the serious, non-judgmental fan who can accept the music on its own terms.<br />And on its own terms, *Riot Act* is a rather successful album, though you can clearly see that PJ is trapped in their own little world with little helpful contact with the outside. It's better than the dreary *Binaural* and the drowsy *Yield* with more experimentation and some moments of serious rocking out. This one is also much more of a group effort than the last album, which was nearly an Eddie Vedder solo record. All five band members are writing songs, and everyone except Mike McCready is writing lyrics (Mike's too much of a pure musician for words). While some of Eddie's songs are dangerously close to countryish singer-songwriter territory (like the snooze-a-thon &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;) there's a real surprise as Matt Cameron makes several strong contributions, making him the most involved of PJ's long line of temporary drummers. I hope he's officially &quot;official&quot; by now. There are a few surprises here, like the healthily rocking &quot;Save You&quot; and &quot;Wanted to Get Right,&quot; while &quot;Bushleager&quot; (though rather clunky overall) has absolutely brilliant lyrics. You don't have to be a genius to figure out who that one's about. The bizarre metallic funk of &quot;You Are&quot; is the biggest surprise - the most eccentric thing PJ has done since way back on *Vitalogy*. While there are some goodies like those, the album is more prone to hermit-like professionalism than passion, showing that PJ is still trapped in their own little space. At least they're still doing it for the real fans.one's about.

B00006M183|3.0|All the great bands/artists of our days have gone through experimental periods of growth and artistry.  So why does Pearl Jam resist the chance to stretch out and grow.  There's certainly nothing wrong with Riot Act, however I get the feeling I'm listening to the same PJ record that I have been for the past 7 years.  Its one thing to not change stylistically, but this record has the same dry &quot;anti-sonic&quot; sound going back to the sound of No Code.  Is progression not in the Pearl Jam vocabulary?
B00006M183|5.0|I have thier very 1st album (ten) on tape. That's an original copy, bought way back when it came out. Now i'll tell you what, the sound of Riot Act, compared to Ten, is way different, but I think that's good. These guys have been able to keep reinventing themselves, and keep coming out with solid album after solid album. Best song on the album, hands down, All or None. If your a pearl jam fan, as I am, you can appreciate this song. Listen to the guitar solo, wow. Work of art. Reminds me of a certain guitarist from the 67-70 era. Eddie's screams on Save You, classic. Listen to him really just let into it. He's still one of the best, and he can still perform. Love boat captain, &quot;i know it's already been sung&quot; ovbiously refering to John Lenon here?I think so. If you consider yourself a fan of pearl jam, like me, and every single other person who bought this album, do yourself a favor and get it.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Maybe it's because the actual music in her songs is the stalest, blandest bubblegum rehash that's dominated the airwaves in ages. Only \\"Just Like A Pill\\" starts off sounding kinda cool, but then falls flat on its face with that tired chorus. Gross.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can't believe that Christina Aguilera puts out such a bad image. I think people are probably afraid to buy her CD because of it. &quot;Dirrty&quot; is the only song on the CD that matches her image. All the other songs are amazing. They dispaly her voice perfectly. It's even better that she helped write most of the songs. This is very mature compared to her last one, which was way too pop. She sure has grown up and it's easy to tell from her new songs. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite CDs ever! I love the songs &quot;Infatuation&quot;, &quot;Soar&quot;, and &quot;Voice Within&quot;. They're truly amazing!
B000001FA4|5.0|This album cemented my status as a lifelong U2 fan. Every album for U2 up to this point has been a great leap forward, but this one steps into another universe. The guitar textures added by the Edge alone constitute a huge breakthrough. Bono does some of the best singing of his career. At the time he said that soul music is when you reveal rather than conceal through singing and Bono is able to convey a lot of feeling this way.<br />\\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" starts off the album, but it is not the strongest track. People have accused it of being muddy, although that's not really the case. There's just a lot of guitar overdubs. The biggest problem is the vocal delivery and the lyrics (\\"I'll be there tonight\\") which have already become U2 cliches. After that though, \\"Pride\\" gets the blood pumping as one of U2's biggest songs, a heartfelt tribute to Martin Luther King. As the song climaxes toward the end, Bono's overdubbed harmonies sound like a choir of angels.<br />Every other song on here is fantastic so I won't ramble. I'll just mention that \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" (probably the most controversial song on the album) is incredible with Bono rambling improvised lyrics and a slow burning build-up.  And \\"Promenade\\" is my absolute favorite.  This is one of those albums that can really evoke a time, a feeling, a memory that claims a place in your heart.
B000002KAT|5.0|this album is almost too good to listen to.  i cannot  put this cd on in the background and do something else.  it is distracting.  when i listen to this album, i sit down and stare at my stereo.  it is mind-boggling.  thank you

B00006RU5B|5.0|The new Audioslave album can be summed up in just one word...AMAZING! For people who wondered what Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine would sound like together...well...it sounds exactly like Soundgarden singing over Rage Against the Machine music...which CAN'T be a bad thing. The guitar from Tom Morello is still fresh and funky and the bass and drumming from Tim and Brad is deep and hits with an impact. Chris Cornell's vocals once again prove he is one of the best vocalists of all time. The album has songs that make you want to jump around and also some mellow songs that are soothing to the ear. This is by far, the best album I have bought in a long time, and I hope it can spark a fire in the rock scene again. Maybe Audioslave can be rock's redemption.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Despite constant debate about the subject of the prequels, once you lay all that aside and look at the movie itself, you realize that The Phantom Menace is indeed a very good movie. There were some very big shoes to fill when Phantom was released and for the most part, people felt like there was something missing. As this movie ages however, I feel that it will begin to grow into those shoes.<br />Set many years before the first trilogy, Phantom Menace introduces the viewer to many new characters along with introducing us to younger versions of some of the classics such as C-3P0 and Obi Wan. The story becomes very interesting once the viewer sees the movie for a second time, after the initial shock has set in and settled down. The movie does a nice job of setting the groundwork for the next two and begins to answer some of the questions about Darth Vader's past. There are dazzling special effects, a very intelligent storyline and great action sequences. The light saber battles are incredible and leave even the most disgruntled viewer feeling pleased.<br />Most people would rather complain about something instead of enjoy it, eventually people will forget about their petty quarrels with the movie and settle down to enjoy the movie as well as the other two prequels. This is a must see for any Star Wars fan young or old.

0060523794|5.0|Imagine a nation without defense, health care and education. And imagine these services without IBM. It is this company (despite criticisms on various fronts) that was responsible for bringing computing to a scale that could run large organizations and even nations. It is natural that such a business assumes elephantine proportions in terms of size and product portfolio. Soon it is accused of monopolistic practices and the elephant slows down. In business terms it turns into a white elephant, slow and sick, on the verge of being dismantled; everyone looking for their fair share of the ivory. Such an elephant needs special treatment, and the ideal person to put it back on its feet, and bring in the agility of a horse should be adept at the skills of a mahout and the training of a Vet. Enter Louis Gerstner Jr.<br />Over the years, thanks to the unbridled market success and subsequently the shadow of antitrust, IBM by the late 80's was a large dysfunctional bureaucracy. IBM had a dress code that again had outlived its times. I remember a joke during the early days of IBM in India: \\" If you see a man dressed in a three piece suit crossing the road on a hot summer noon in Delhi, chances are that he is mad or he is from IBM.\\" <br />IBM's basic Beliefs were misinterpreted and practiced contrary to the very purpose of their origins. \\"Superior customer service\\" came to mean, \\"Servicing our machines on customers' premises,\\" instead of paying real attention to their business. \\" Excellence in everything we do\\" became an obsession with perfection and a led to several layers of checks and approvals, slowing down decision making and delaying product launches and response times. \\" Respect for the individual\\" soon became an interpretation for life long employment, entitlement for rich benefits and the freedom to ignore organizational priorities over that of the individuals'.As a group, the employees served themselves better than they did their customers. <br />Among the various issues on product portfolio, pricing and customer service, the greatest challenge faced by Lou appears to be on the cultural front at IBM. Being an outsider, and the time it would take to gain acceptance in a multinational organization as big as IBM, the biggest challenge is his battle is against IBM's insiders; entrenched bureaucrats, steeped in old ways who kill initiatives in new directions.  <br />The transformation that Lou brought starts with the compensation system. Commonality, Fixed rewards, Internal benchmarks and entitlement was what he saw in IBM. These words were replaced with Differentiation, Variable rewards, External benchmarks and Performance. <br />The chapters that deal with product portfolio decisions, strategy and e-Business make interesting reading. But the bull, I am sorry, the elephant is caught by the horns, I mean, by the tusks, quite early in the book. In the end, when Lou bids farewell to the new IBM, he admits that his heart has become a \\"true Blue\\". Jim Burke had mentioned to Lou before he took the IBM job: \\" You owe it to America to take the job\\". A job well done, now America owes it to Lou for saving the national treasure.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|That was the most twisted piece of cinematography and intelligent storytelling I've ever witnessed. For a long time I have wondered what my most favourite film of all time is. Well, I now know. Donnie Darko. Anyone who says &quot;I don't get it&quot;, has simply missed the point. I'd say to them, &quot;watch it again, and then watch it again&quot;. I did. And now I'm going to watch it again. This movie simply cannot be seen once.<BR>  It's clever. Maybe slightly too clever. But that never spoils the intrigue.<BR>Richard Kelly.<BR>The man is a legend.
B00006X06U|5.0|With its richly textured orchestrations and lush, heartfelt vocals, this Travelogue collection is Joni's crowning lifetime achievement.  No wonder Joni can't stand the music business; she's in a class by herself.  This is a completely unique project that magically manages to be both sweeping in its grandeur, yet as intimate as a whisper in your ear.  It's hard to pick out favorite tracks, because this is really a work of art as a whole rather than the sum of its parts, but I particularly love Hejira (which I heard performed live on Joni's last tour) because the orchestra and jazz band at its center sustain Joni's beautifully matured voice and her lyrics in a caress of music that will make your soul melt.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I just want to add that you can really hear the growth in Beck's phrasing on this album. It has matured greatly since Mutations.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Lightning does strike twice!  Williams has done a fantastic job composing the music for Chamber of Secrets.  Both Sorcerer's stone and Chamber of Secrets are worth checking out!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is the best rock album to come out in years, possibly since the last Soundgarden album, 'Down on the Upside.'  Very aggressive guitars and Chris Cornell's awesome vocals and lyrics.  Audioslave has brought together everything great about Soundgarden and RATM and created something completely their own.  Buy it today!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I must admit when I first heard Chris Cornell was teaming up with the remaining members of RAGE, I was skeptical.  But this album is the perfect blend of true musicians.  This is one of the best albums of the year in my opinion.  The mix sounds like what I thought Euphoria Morning was going to sound like, but Cornell was a little too mellow on that album.  Here he is back to his old Soundgarden days of screaming and the high pitch we loved on Superunknown.  Being a fan of both RAGE and Soundgarden, this album could be considered the followup to Down on the Upside - If Soundgarden were still together, and the followup to Renegades - only BETTER.<br />This album has many tunes that you definitely hear the RAGE guitar you are used to, and mixed with Chris's voice, it is a perfect album.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone that is a Sondgarden or RAGE fan, you WON'T (or shouldn't) be disappointed.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison leaves us with a classic, a fine sequel to his last album - 1987's Cloud Nine.  George knew he didn't have long to live while recording this CD, but does not dwell on death here, instead celebrating love and life.  Brainwashed is an uplifting and memorable collection of songs, with light-touch production from Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison. It ranks with the best work that George recorded in his near 40-year music career.  I wish there could be more...<br />Now it's time for those remasters of George's back catalog!
B000002BQK|4.0|I bought this CD for the song Butterfly but when i first heard it I was really dissapointed because it has so many R'n B/Hio Hop songs on it that are really boring. Now I have it for almost three years and I really like it. But it's as i said by far not her best work.<BR>Honey: I didn't like this at first. It introduces not only the album but also the &quot;new&quot; Mariah. Now i like it.<BR>Butterfly: This ballad is still my favourite song on the album.<BR>My all: This is Old school Mariah. If you liked the songs from &quot;Music box&quot; you'll probably like this one.<BR>The roof: This is just boring. Why did she release it as a single?<BR>Breakdown: The same goes with this one.(Wasn't right was it?)<BR>Babydoll: The lyrics are so sassy. Sweet like sugar<BR>Close my eyes: Very atmospheric ballad with wonderful lyrics.<BR>Whenever you call: Another Old school Mariah - ballad. This is the version without Bryan McKnight.<BR>The beautiful ones: Please, no Prince-song!<BR>Outside: Nice song.
B000002UB6|5.0|Without a doubt Let it Be is an underrated record.  So, it may not have the coherence or sharp production of Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road and dare I say it, the &quot;White Album&quot; (which sort of gels in its own crazy way), but no album containing Let it Be, The Long and Winding Road, Get Back, I Me Mine and Across the Universe can be bad.  The production does seem wrong (George Martin could have done a better job in my opinion) but the songs themselves are good - although John's contribution may be fairly minor compared to that on previous releases, Paul turns out some of his best songs ever, as does George.  At some moments this album is more hard-rocking than anything else the Beatles recorded.  The end result may be a bit sloppy, but its not that bad.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album is one of the best CD's in my collection. I was HIGHLY impressed with the amazing drum work,sadistic bass lines and demonic guitar riffs. This album is also a lyrical work of art. I highly recomened this album for anyone!
0393312836|5.0|This book is a genuinely unique literary experience.  Having read some of Burgess other novels, I can only fathom what sort of talent he must have had to completely step outside his own norm in order to adopt a completely unorthodox presentation; focusing strongly on language, humanism, and plot.  His other works, Such As \\"The Doctor Is Sick\\" showcase his style of using alternate spelling of words to make them sound phoenetically like a certain dialect, where he even \\"spelled\\" out lisps in characters who spoke with them, almost as otomotopeia. In \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" this device is altered and taken to an extreme; here the words are all new, all unique derivatives of Russian and English syllables combined to form an intuitive language that the reader comes to understand while moving through the novella.<br />Burgess rationalizes the slang in his introduction of this book, stating that it was meant to make the almost overly-shocking or pornographic nature of it's content seem more acceptable, if that were possible. The slang is very hard to explain and very abstract at first, but once you settle in and get used to Alex's use of it, his words become second nature.  That if nothing else is true testament to Burgess' skill in crafting this \\"nasty little shocker.\\"<br />To summarize the plot in a few sentences, The story focuses on Alex, a teenager who lives in the near future where the streets are ravaged at night by violence and deviant teenagers.  Alex, the main character of the book, is such a teenager, and routinely commits acts of \\"ultraviolence,\\" including beatings, rapings, burglary, you get the picture.  He finally pushes his luck too far and commits an act, and then is incarcerated.<br />This is just the beginning few events in the novella, and I don't want to ruin the experience should you decide to read it.<br />This book brings several issues to the reader's attention in terms of how we percieve our own inalienable rights as humans.  One of the most important questions this book asks whether we cease to be human when we are stripped of free choice.  I'll go no further than this, though I'm only grazing the surface here. Like I said I don't want to ruin the experience for you.<br />I treasure this book; it is by far one of my favorite three pieces of literature simply because it is daring, psychological, and completely unique in that it teaches a lesson in the most unlikely way imaginable.  If you aren't faint of heart, give this one a try, and you may be impressed.<br />And once you get about 3 quarters of the way through the book, ask yourself if you feel sorry for poor old Alex.  You may be surprised at yourself....nt questions this book asks whether we cease to be human when we are stripped of free choice.

0380789035|4.0|Here's the gameplan, travel the country visiting local tourist attractions pleading your case to the dying gods of \\"the old world\\" while avoiding the gods of this \\"brave new world\\" and you have the culmination of several small cons perpetrated by Shadow an ex-convict and Wednesday, not the day, the man, excuse me, I should say the god.<br />It's Wednesday (the day this time), and Shadow is finally released from prison, after serving 3 years of a 6 year sentence, and learning that his wife died in a car accident. As if the release from prison and planning how to deal with the death of a spouse Shadow gains a new job as an errand boy/bodyguard for Mr. Wednesday. They travel the countryside and Shadow meets all sorts of interesting people. A leprachaun who loves to fight and pulls gold coins right out of the air. A curvaceous Easter who lies to herself that people still believe what they practice in worship. Mr. Town and Mr. World who work for shiny new gods of computers and media. The punchline. . .War, on a godlike scale. It's all about preparing your army, maneuvering into position, and learning what you really believe.<br />This is a fantastic read. Gaiman paints the gods with such vivid irony and cynicism that it's almost impossible to claim that they don't really exist. Not to mention the bizarre web of short tales that permeate the overall novel, they explore all manner of worship and belief. But for me the ultimate thrill in the tale is in it's Hero, Shadow, a man who is not dead, and yet somehow isn't really living either. A man who is haunted by his late wife, and dreams of buffalo-gods, towers of human skulls, and thunderbird feathers.<br />Read and believe, if only for a moment that the gods are here; that we need to believe almost as much as they need to be believed in; that there are things that we really can't explain without them.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I always felt like George was an underrated songwriter who created several songs as fine as anything from the famed Lenon-McCartney partnership.  I really grooved on the classy reissue of his masterpiece All Things Must Pass a couple of years ago.  As for this final work from the Spiritual Beatle, I would like to try talking about it as a collection of music.  In other words, let's avoid the temptation to rate it as a perfect album simply because it was his last recording.<br />There are many strong aspects of the new disc, such as George's marvelous slide guitar playing, especially on the sublime instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues.&quot;  Jeff Lynne's production is non-intrusive for a change, allowing both the guitars and vocals to come through clearly.  The whole album has a light-hearted feel about it, not necessarily what you would expect from a man in his last days.  Several songs have the same casual air as Harrison's songs with the Traveling Wilburys.  That makes them pleasant to listen to, but let's be honest...a couple of the tunes are pretty insubstantial (ex., &quot;Run So Far&quot;).  On several occasions he reaches for another immortal composition but doesn't quite hit the target (&quot;Never Get Over You&quot;).  After hearing this CD about 2 and 1/2 times, I'm left feeling the loss that we will no longer have George Harrison with us here on this plane, but it's not this album that will stick with me, it's his greater body of work.
0790749815|5.0|This is Gary's best movie as far as I am concerned!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Another Opeth album, and again the pillars of progressive metal must inevitably quake in terrified awe. Luckily, most will remain safe since Opeth basically remains a niche within a niche. For the esurient progressive music fan not queasy with a hellish vocal, however, it is obvious that they are one of progressive metal's leading bands.<br />Opeth's latest album continues to their brutal heavy passages with gorgeous acoustic interludes and a protean expanse of other flavors ranging from Scandinavian folk to jazz to 70s prog. Even though this is their sixth album, Mikael Åkerfeldt's bohemian preoccupation with creating progressive music remains as poignant as ever. While _Deliverance_ does call upon familiar elements from past albums, it likewise adds new assets to the Opethian palette -- especially the final song, \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\". After all, Opeth is nothing if not surprising.<br />Right now, I'm not sure how I would rate this relative to other Opeth works. Certain things are clear, however. For one thing, it the most complex musically. This makes it difficult to take in quickly, but Opeth was never musical fast-food anyway. With only six songs, all ten minutes or longer (not including a short instrumental), it is quite overwhelming to take in at first. The astonishing drumming, heaviness, and seemingly impenetrable song structures necessitate a lot of listening. Lyrically, Åkerfeldt has mined a very personal side which makes this the most emotional of Opeth's albums. The lyrics are gorgeous, haunting, darkly evocative. Ex. \\"Pacing further down   Familiar children's laughter   Dissonant and out of time   And their eyes are dead   Watching myself in a pool of water   Wearing the mask of a ghost   Smeared all across my skin   Rotten earth and insects.\\" Creepy!<br />\\"Wreath\\" opens with a tempestuous fury unlike any previous Opeth song. An inferno of guitars pours on the attack, a gale of drums besieges the mix, and Åkerfeldt's chthonic growl waste no time getting into things. The towering sonic architecture of Opeth's compositions stands out for all 11 minutes of this fierce track, a menagerie of dark, crushing rhythms.<br />As this song demonstrates, the band is so surreally powerful due to the sheer density of their heavy assault, especially here, because this is their heaviest album by a fair margin. This disc is a big onslaught of sound. Opeth's thick wall-of-sound arrangements are not just distorted blobs of noise, however -- the instrumental interplay is elaborately constructed, rife with nuance and intricacy. Guitars are often used in a keyboard like way, creating waves of ambience over top a scorched-earth battlefield of guitars and drums and the hellfire vocals of Åkerfeldt.<br />\\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" is one of the most experimental Opeth song to date. Early on, the gelid growls washing over the acoustic guitar is an absolutely spellbinding and somewhat unnerving effect. Later, an eerie section evoking carnival music forms a haunting atmosphere. Awesome riffs are everywhere. And when it goes quiet at the end, keep listening...one of the most mysteriously beautiful Opeth moments brings the album to its end.<br />And in between, you have four other amazing songs: \\"Deliverance\\" is sure to be an Opethian classic, with awesome riffs from the outset, stirring ambiance, and beautiful soft sections; \\"A Fair Judgment\\", a pseudo-ballad with soaring guitars lines, melting pianos, ghostly bursts of atmosphere, gorgeous vocal harmonies (you can hear Steven Wilson's vocal influence big time); \\"For Absent Friends\\", a brief halcyon instrumental with a touch of jazz; and \\"Master's Apprentices\\", opening with an evil groove and proceeding through a terrain of rhythmic power and gorgeous soft passages typical of Opeth.<br />_Deliverance_ demonstrates clearly that Åkerfeldt is turning into a fine singer. While he summons forth his demonic growl from some nether realm, his singing voice must be called from the heavens. He is also a classic aesthete, with an ear for arrangement and chord selections that would humble the best.<br />_Deliverance_ showcases a band that continues to astonish and grow. _Deliverance_ makes previous albums -- while beautiful and amazing -- seem underdeveloped, in a way. In March 2003, Opeth will release the _Deliverance_'s \\"mellow\\" follow-up called _Damnation_. Until then, we can revel in what we have here -- yet another astonishing release from one of the most powerful forces in progressive metal. Opeth is a truly mythic experience, and _Deliverance_ is your salvation from traditional prog metal. Enjoy.ens.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect when I heard Cornell was teaming up with the remaining members of Rage.  I have always been a pretty big Rage fan, and Soundgarden was pretty good, but never really got into 'em.  But this cd is purely awesome.<br />Cornells voice is very good on all the tracks.  Morellos crazy guitar effect things are still there, and he's still badass.  <br />All the tracks are extremely well done.  <br />I like how on the inside book it says &quot;All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals&quot;  None of that crazy mixing stuff, or turntables for Audioslave.  Truly what music has been missing lately, some good ole ROCK!

0060934913|4.0|Tony Bourdain's work unpretentiously describes the world of cooking as seen by a cook. His gruff prose and semantic swagger match perfectly the world he describes, often reading like a collection of choice transcripts from kitchen conversations. If you want insight into a world you don't know, if you want the lowdown on what those immigrant are doing to your food while you enjoy candle light and conversation, or if you want information on how to become, yourself, a culinary master--this is not the book for you.<BR>If, however, you've spent any time at all behind the swinging doors--as cook, expediter, dishwater, or even waitron--even for just a short time--you'll love it. You'll see a lot of people you know, you'll relive luxurious and painful experiences. You will laugh until you cry. <BR>This insider-chic is not, however, Tony's one big flaw. That flaw, rather, is the foolish notion that his life outside of the restaurant is uninteresting. He left me hungry for more information on his drug problem (and, no, I do not consider this non-pertinent to his culinary career) and more about his wife, Nancy.
B00005JKED|1.0|This movive was terrible, let alone the flagrant attempt at street-esque scriptwriting. Come on.
B000066F6H|5.0|For the first time in over a decade, I find myself embracing a new musical style and getting every CD from this new crop of bands I can get my hands on.  The corporate powers that be haven't really come up with a convenient catch-all name for this music.  Some are calling it \\"garage-rock revivial\\", some are calling it \\"pseudo-punk\\", some are calling it \\"retro-rock\\", some call it \\"attack of the 'silent e' bands\\".  Call it what you want, but the White Stripes, the Hives, the Strokes, and the Vines really rock my world as of late.   Of the most recent albums by all four of these groups, the Hives' CD is easily the hardest rocking and the least diverse in its offerings, but this is hardly a liability.  It's just a full-on noisy burst of energy, front to back.  Forget all those so-called punk bands of the 90's like Green Day and Blink-182, this is easily the most punk album to be put out since the heyday of the Clash and the Sex Pistols.  <br />\\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" is the obvious crowd-pleaser, boasting a catchy hook and Top 40-minded production flourishes (a little bit of chugging synthesizer in the intro, Go-Go's-style tambourine keeping time throughout the tune), but \\"Main Offender\\" and \\"Supply And Demand\\" also have some instant sing-along appeal to them.  Elsewhere are the full-throttle workouts \\"Die, All Right!\\", \\"Statecontrol\\", and \\"Outsmarted\\", the out-of-left-field \\"Find Another Girl\\" (a 60's-style ballad, and therefore the only song that truly sounds different from the rest of them), and the bizarrely-titled \\"The Hives - Declare Guerrre Nucleaire\\" and \\"The Hives - Introduce The Metric System In Time\\".   <br />Best yet, this CD is only about 27 minutes long.  Some of you may balk at that as being a [cheat], but in this age of bloated CD's with way too many songs that boast quantity over quality, 27 minutes is plenty for me.  To be honest, much more than that would get old after awhile.  I mean let's face it, punk is meant to kind of grate on you, and you can only \\"enjoy\\" being grated on for so long.  <br />If you like this, check out the White Stripes \\"White Blood Cells\\" as well!
B00006RU5B|5.0|We all know the members of the band and with the first song Cochise this album does not let up. A strong mix of hard songs and some surprisingly slower songs, Like a Stone and I am the Highway are awesome. Also the genius that is Tom Morello comes out as usual with his powerful guitar in all songs. There is some influence from his time spent with The Crystal Method on Hypnotize as well.<br />I was kind of skeptical at first to hear Chris Cornell with the remaining members of what was Rage, but he does not disappoint. On the harder songs you are expecting to hear Zack, but it still takes some time to get used to, but all the other songs he sounds right at home. <br />If you liked Rage you need to check this out, if you were a fan of Soundgarden you need to check this out too. The album is great, there is not a bad song on it. Just hit play, sit back, and enjoy the ride!
B00006RU5B|5.0|With the cool voice and pulse-pounding music, this cd is an excellent buy.  There's a good variety; the types of songs that make you angry and feel like driving fast and the more mellow songs that let you experience the brilliant lyrics.  This is an awesome collaboration that you do not want to miss.  Buy it now!  You won't be disappointed.
B000035Z3K|5.0|This DVD is the \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" of the classic Universal horror films released in that format. It includes a quality print of the Bella Lugosi DRACULA, with options to play the film with Philip Glass' recent soundtrack; the so-called \\"Spanish\\" DRACULA starring Carlos Villarias; and a fascinating documentary hosted by Carla Laemmle, who has a bit role in the Lugosi DRACULA and who was niece to Universal studio head Carl Laemmle.  There is also an audio track by David J. Skal, production notes, and the like.<br /><br />The Lugosi DRACULA is somewhat problematic.  DRACULA had been previously (and illegally) filmed as the silent NOSFERATU, and a later stage adaptation proved a staple of the British theatre.  When the stage play at last arrived in New York, the title role fell to Bela Lugosi.  Although Universal optioned the material, studio head Carl Laemmle was not enthusiastic about it; although European films were comfortable with the supernatural, American films were not, and Laemmle did not believe the public would accept such an irrational story.  Nor was Laemmle interested in Lugosi; if DRACULA was to be filmed, it would be filmed with Lon Chaney.<br /><br />When Chaney died the screen role went to Lugosi by default, but there were further issues.  Originally planned as a big-budget production, the deeping Great Depression made the film's box office possibilities seem even slighter than before and its budget was cut to the bone.  And Todd Browning, who had been such a successful director of the macabre in the silent era, proved clumsy with sound.  The resulting film was more than a little clunky--but it had two things going for it: a superior first thirty minutes and Lugosi.  Although Lugosi's performance may seem excessively mannered by today's standards, audiences of the 1930s found it terrifying--and even today, when the character of Dracula comes to mind, we are more likely to think of Lugosi than other actor that later played the role.<br /><br />For a brief time after the advent of sound, several studios made foreign language versions of their productions.  The \\"Spanish\\" DRACULA was one such film, and when the English language company wrapped for the day the Spanish speaking cast arrived and filmed through the night using the same sets.  This gave the Spanish company the benefit of hindsight: they were perfectly aware of what the English language company was doing, and they deliberately set out to best it.  The result is a somewhat longer, more cohesive film with some of the most arresting visuals and camera work of the early sound era.  But unfortunately, star Carlos Villarias was no Bella Lugosi: although much of his performance was more subtle than Lugosi's, it was also less intimidating, and where today Lugosi seems mannered, Villarias seems unfortunately comic.  In a perfect world, we would be able to insert the Lugosi performance into the \\"Spanish\\" Dracula.  As it is, we are left with two deeply flawed but nonetheless fascinating films.<br /><br />In their own ways, both films proved incredibly influential, and it is difficult to imagine the evolution of the classic-style horror film without reference to both the Lugosi and the \\"Spanish\\" DRACULA.  The Lugosi film is not perfectly restored, but the print is very, very good, easily the best I have seen.  The \\"Spanish\\" DRACULA has more problematic elements, partly due the fact that the film borrowed some scenic footage from the Lugosi version and snips of footage from earlier films (there even appears to be a brief clip of the ballet from the silent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in the film); the film is sometimes dark, sometimes very spotted, but short of a cgi restoration this is probably as good as it gets.<br /><br />The Philip Glass soundtrack, which is optional, tends to divide viewers.  The Lugosi DRACULA had virtually nothing in the way of soundtrack; the \\"Spanish\\" DRACULA used music to a greater degree, but even so that degree is comparative.  The Glass scoreis often quite interesting, but it is also as often intrusive as it is effective.  Some feel it adds quite a bit to the film; others find it distracts.  Whatever one's reaction to the film, either English or Spanish language, or with or without the Glass score, this is a remarkable DVD package, and fans of classic horror will find it an almost inexhaustible pleasure.  I cannot recommend it too strongly.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweris often quite interesting, but it is also as often intrusive as it is effective.

B00006F7S4|4.0|The transformation of Beck from street musician to eclectic recording artist and songwriting wizard must have been a difficult one, and we see an awful lot of pain in the album. The songs all have a serious, sad, sometimes powerful tone to them, which is not actually matched by the lyrics when you take a good listen - there is hope there.<br />But what really impressed me was the arrangements. There are a lot of strings on here, and the arrangements vary from sparse to bombastic. The fourth song, &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot;, in particular has one of the most powerful string arrangements ever commited to disc. <br />Those arrangements - it's obvious that great care was taken in making this album, something which cannot be said for all releases. I played it awfully loud yesterday, and became thoroughly involved. It is a participatory album, not one that listens well in the background. You pretty much have to pay attention to this one.

0316666343|1.0|I guess you either love or hate this book.  When I see the stacks and stacks  ... - one sure sign of the new author's rite of passage - I marvel at the marketing power of the book industry.  The book is deceiving, with its theme, concept, and moral/ethical stance.  And what a marvelous premise.  As a single mom of an 11-yr-old girl, I think about this sort of thing constantly.  Unfortunately, what starts out so promising fizzles like a cheap firework snake.  The heaven scenes were laughable (why all the forced \\"Heaven\\" geography?), the family dynamics played out like a worn out soap opera, and the ending was so contrived it almost made me hurl. (And that bathtub scene - shamelessly stolen from \\"Ghost.\\")  Fortunately I only wasted an afternoon and a trip to the library (something told me not to spend any money on this one).  Sebold: bag the fiction and stick to memoir.

B00006RU5B|5.0|What more can you expect from the best collaberation in years, singer Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and the members of Rage Against the Machine (minus Zack de la Rocha). From track 1 to track 14, Chris's deep vocals are amazing and the music behind it is stunning. If you don't like their new single \\"Cochise\\" that much, don't worry, it wouldn't even be in my top 5 favorite songs of the album. This CD is very different from the typical watered-down rock that's been released. First of all, most rock CDs have about 12 songs on it. Secondly, there's usually about 2 maybe 3 good songs on them. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself the only rock CD that's worth buying, Audioslave.
B000002IZM|5.0|The best soundtrack album I own.<BR>I liked the film, but to me it seems that it's popular in a cult way because it's moody, different and because fashionable people want to like it. <br />However, I think the soundtrack is excellent and has universal appeal. The snippets from the film become inbedded into your head after a few listens - quoting &quot;artificial owls&quot; and &quot;attack ships on fire&quot;. I love listening to this CD when I'm relaxing. A long train journey, in a bath, or after herbal indulgences. Vangelis does a great job, I love the sweeping music and mix of musical styles apparent on this CD.<br />DJ Paul Oakenfold voted this his favourite album ever. I'm not going that far but if I'm on a desrt island and Ive got limited space - I'm taking this CD.<br />Highly recomended!
B00004W19V|4.0|A feature with a feel I consider to be slightly different than others.  This movie bases itself around a piece of machinery that becomes much more.  Like many movies out there it explores concepts of AI, but further more artificial emotions.  Expressed in what I feel is a highly entertaining and humorous manor, it is definately worth a viewing, and perhaps owning.<BR>Of course there is the draw back, of the fact the DVD is letterbox widescreen, meaning that if you have, or plan to get a widescreen TV the quality will be short of that of an anamorphic version which appears not to exist at the time, it is the sole reason for 4 versus 5 stars.

This movie also stars Don Knots, Audrey Meadows,John Astin, and The New York Yankees. It a great movie for any fan of either Grant's or Day's.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have read the book, and the movie mostly follows it.  There are a few slight differences though, but in general it was a great movie with flawless computer graphics and special effects.<br />The only problem i had was that the movie was based in a place with english accents, and some word choice that might not be heard in the USA threw me off.  Such as when Mr Dursely called the mail service &quot;post&quot;, whereas in the USA we call it &quot;mail&quot;.  None the less, still very easy to follow, and they really did a great job with the Twist ending.<br />Note: This movie is for kids and adults alike.<br />~hope this helps
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you liked the film, you will love this CD, Oh Brother Where Art Thou.  It has all the toe-tapping cuts from the movie and is one of the few sound tracks I recommend.  Sometimes with sound tracks, you end up with music that means little without the film to accompany it.<br />Generally, I review Celtic music, which is my first love - followed by a small circle of classic rock and classical.  I tend to avoid any kind of music which even remotely sounds like bluegrass with vocals (although I like instrumental bluegrass quite a lot.)  You will probably never see me give a good review to rap, or most pop music.  If I don't like this kind of music that I cannot be impartial, which is the point of the review.<br />If I had not seen the movie first, I might not have written this review, but the music was so good, I had to eat my words about what I really like - which caused me to have to revamp my standards...Well, I did so, and I lived through it, much to my delight.<br />I enjoyed this CD and recommend it highly.  It isn't your typical country/bluegrass music, and it will change the opinions of those who might be expecting otherwise.  <br />Remember when someone said to you, &quot;Try it, you'll like it.&quot;?  At some point in your life, you were pleasantly surprised about whatever new thing you experienced for the first time.  I had that experience when I first ate lobster, escargot and crablegs - all I could say and think was &quot;Oh wow...&quot; - and I have consumed them all with great enthusiasm.<br />So, I say to you, &quot;Try it - you'll be surprised!&quot;<br />Catherine Wallace<BR>Celtic Music Review
B00001R3HX|5.0|Out of all the pre-Signify releases of PT (the time-frame I consider their original sound much like the Moody Blues had a Classic 7 era), I consider Up the Downstair to be my personal favorite.  This album is pre-Chris Maitland as well, they were still using drum samples and synth for most of this album.  My favorite cuts are &quot;Synesthesia&quot;, &quot;Always Never&quot;, &quot;Small Fish&quot;, and &quot;Fadeaway&quot; (probably my favorite way PT has EVER ended an album and one of the most beautiful rock songs of ALL time in my opinion).
B00006RU5B|4.0|I was always a fan of both Soundgarden and RATM. I'll admit that when I first heard of this project I was thinking.. that will be interesting.. in a bad way.. but.. I have to admit, this is an excellent CD. The music is great... I haven't listened to it enough times to do a breakdown and get all technical, but, if you liked either of these bands, chances are you'll find something you like here.. Unless of course you're one of those I hate anything that is new people.. in which case.. I am wasting my words.
B00006LSM3|5.0|WOW what an amazing cut.  Great to hear George tip his hat to Cab (The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea) Calloway in this awesome CD.  The wonderful thing about covers is that they bring people together around a common denominator. When you hear the Calloway Original version next to Harrison the connection is even clearer! Cab Calloway was THE afro-male popsinger from the 20's to the 40's, dominated the way the Beatles dominated, and recorded the ultimate version of this song before George's take.  It's GREAT to hear George make the Calloway link, just like Janet Jackson, and Tupak. I love this CD!!!

I know all of these guys have been in headline bands before- and comparisons are obviously going to be made to their past works (at least on this first album), and rightly so. Their are certain songs that musically just have that \\"Rage\\" sound... crunching riffs and bass lines and the \\"Tom Morello Guitar Solo\\" (effects out the ...). And by the same token, there are songs where just through his voice, Chris Cornell brings that \\"Soundgarden\\" sound- I think that was to be expected in their first effort... not that sounding like either of those bands is a BAD thing- I'm just trying to brace you for what you are going to hear when you put this one in your cd player... BUT I can't prepare you!!! The sound is neither \\"Rage\\" nor is it \\"Soundgarden\\"... these four musicians have created their own sound on many of the songs on this album and they're calling it \\"Audioslave\\"!!! If you don't think Tom Morello knows how to play a pretty guitar? I would suggest you listen to track #8 (I Am the Highway) as well as track #13 (Getaway Car)*my favorite 2 songs on the entire album because they give us a great sound that we have not heard before (almost a classic rock/ bluesy type of feel) and if this sound is going to be the \\"Audioslave\\" sound, then I'm already on the edge of my seat for the second album*  YES!!! This is definitely a five star album- it truly has it all. Neither ex-\\"Rage\\" fans or \\"Soundgarden\\" converts will have anything to complain about- but MORE important is that this album will satisfy many more fans than either of those bands could ever have done alone. PICK THIS ONE UP NOW!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|I found this album, like all PT releases, to take on a life of its own.  There is something indescribable about the PT sound...it creates visual landscapes in your mind with every listen, they have their own 'sound' and are beautifully atmospheric.  This album continues that PT tradition and just like with every album, each one has its own place.  PT are in no way a stagnant, boring band.  The musicianship is virtuoso and the writing is pleasantly transparent proving it isn't about the lyrics, the music takes the gold.  This album is a consistent, dark trip (much darker than past PT releases).  My favorite cuts are \\"Gravity Eyelids\\", \\"Trains\\", \\"Strip The Soul\\", and \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\".
B00003CXZ4|1.0|The film attempts to make you feel as confused as the lead character.  But misses the mark terribly.  The backwards progression of the film becomes EXTREMELY ANNOYING and frankly, this film is totally predictable.  One of the worst films I have ever seen.
B00006LSM3|3.0|Don't get me wrong!  It is a very good album.  Nevertheless, I do like better Cloud Nine, even though it is very commercial.  His lyrics are very good, but the musical part tends to be somewhat repetitious.  His slide playing is all over the place, which is a treat for every one who truly appreciates his playing.  I expected more from the CD liner notes, something related to Harrison's departure, last days, and final input on this album.  To my dismay, it doesn't have too much information on the liner notes -- besides, I think there are no liner notes.  To this moment, I have only listened to it once, so don't assume this review is &quot;written in stone&quot;.  Up to now, my favourites are the first and last song.  But this can surely change!  George Harrison was a great lyricist, guitarist, composer and singer.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Well, I'd like to bash this album, but I can't ignore decent guitar playing. At least he can play his instrument. What ever happened to singing? His voice is .. well.. not that good. Sounds like a DMB wanna-be. And his song writing - well.. it's not good either - there is no deep meaning to it. This album is made for teenagers who think they like to listen to adult music. This music is easy to write, and seems more like an advertisement than a music record. John Mayer made a record for the wallet and not something from his heart.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Excellent, is all I can say. Chris Cornell, hands down, is the greatest rock vocalist around today, which was shown during the Soundgarden days &amp; especially with his solo project, but this collaboration with the members of Rage cements it! My faith in great music has been revived in the last year with Bjork's unbelievably creative CD &quot;Vespertine&quot; and now &quot;Audioslave&quot; :-) Thanks guys!
B00005BIIP|4.0|While not a proper album, this collection of rarities and outtakes would serve a PT fanatic well.  It has a nice assortment of songs and none of them are 'awful' which most bands CANNOT say about their outtakes.  While I am not huge on some of the tracks, I do like the majority.  Personally, I DO NOT understand why &quot;Buying New Soul&quot; is not on an album.  It has to be my favorite cut from the CD, I love the lush, dark, and atmospheric keyboard intro (my favorite keyboard riff of any PT song).  I also like the track &quot;Disappear&quot; a lot and feel it deserved an proper album slot as well.  This is all in all a GREAT CD for any PT collector or anyone who is looking for a bit rarer taste of PT.
0380973650|5.0|I've been a fan of his writting for years, and he's only getting better.  The only gripe I had with this story was the hero's conclusions which he jumps to with little to no evidence supporting his correct conclusions - or maybe I'm mad at myself since I didn't see them all in advance.
B000002BQK|5.0|The lyrics are amazing, the music is awesome, her voice sounds great.. The songs are INCREDIBLE. Enough said really.....check the other reviews for more info ;-)
0316666343|5.0|This is a must read.  Alice Sebold does a brilliant job of detailing the grief process.  I loved this book!
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is the greatest piece of work that Kevin Smith has ever done.
B00006CXXU|4.0|You'd think this album would be typical pop album, especially after you saw her new video \\"Dirrty\\".  In fact, all but 2 other songs are actually in depth and personal.  I didn't really like \\"Make Over\\", for it's more of a rock song.  My favorite songs definitely have to be Can't Hold Us Down, The Voice Within, and Fighter!  I love their vibe!  I must admit this IS NOT A DANCE ALBUM.  It's just one of those CD's you lie down and listen too.  But it's still terrific.  I like Britney spears, but NOBODY can sing better than Christina!!!!
B000002G0P|5.0|This album is a journey into the hearts of the artists who created it. Not many artists expose themselves so openly to their fans the way these guys do. Each and every song seems to cry out &quot;Look at me. This is who I am as person. This is how I feel. These are my weaknesses and fears. These are the things that make me angry and sad. This is what frustrates me.&quot; As you listen to the album you begin to empathize with the artists, because you probably feel the same way. We all feel a little overwhelmed by the ugliness of the world sometimes. We all want to find something to believe in in the midst of the chaos we live in.<br />Side I: Yours looks at the world at large. There is war, hypocrasy, racism, violence, and anyone who stands up and tries to change things is usually taken out. <br />So then Side II: Mine goes all introspective, looking at how a person deals with the chaos of the world in their own mind and heart. Is there answers to be found in Love? Family? Religion? Is there no help from above to guide us through all this mess? <br />Finally Side III: The truth attempts to answer these questions. Rise n' Shine suggests that there is hope, but it must be sought out. Am I Ever Gonna Change? implies that the solution must come from within, by conquering your own faults and failures a person. It talks of accountability for your own actions. Whether you're good or not is up to you. You can't just let a priest wave his hand and absolve you of your sins with a short chant. Who Cares? is an examination of the loss of hope in a person's life. If nobody really cares then what's the point of going on with anything? This song is offered as a prayer to a God who may or may not be there, or seemingly doesn't care. The prayers is answered in the music though. The beauty of it suggests that God is there and he does care. He has not given up on the world and if the individual will continue to seek him he will be found. Of course this is simply my interpretation. Youshould listen to it for yourself to find out what it means for you.<br />A few people have classified this album as Christian-themed. While there is mention of God, and even quotations from the Bible I think it's more an examination of faith in general. The songs discuss the search for God as a possible answer to the trials of life. It is never suggested that Christianity is the answer (though they probably believe it is), rather, they examine the struggles a person has in trying to believe in God and hang onto faith in such a dark world. It should not be thought of as preachy or religious.<br />Not only does this album tell a story in itelf. It also tells a story in the history of Extreme as a band. This album fits comfortably in between Pornograffitti and Waiting for the Punchline, starting out with riffy hits like Rest in Peace and Warheads as was typical on Pornograffitti, and ending on a sad note with songs about fading hope and growing cynicism which lead perfectly into Waiting for the Punchline, an angry album rife with bitterness and cynicism. This album works as a segue between the previous and next albums.
B000003TAL|4.0|Daydream Nation is widely considered as one of the great alternative masterpieces of the 80s. I bought this album having heard only one song (Teen Age Riot) and reading the huge praise of the album. And this is one great sound: the energy, wit and rawness of punk mixed with the epic scope of progrock/artrock. It does take more than one listen to get. Here's a trackbytrack:<br />1. Teen Age Riot - Utterly brilliant. Great lyrics, riffage, drumming, craftsmanship - everything. Sums up everything DN is about. Rating: 10/10<BR>2. Silver Rocket - Opens with doomy arpeggios and riffs. A very angry sounding song, and an excellent one, but the rock song doesn't last long - it moves into pure distortion before the second minute. Rating: 8/10<BR>3. The Sprawl - Fantastic lyrics, ridiculously cool. Threatening sounding. Breaks down for the last few minutes. Rating: 9/10<BR>4. Cross The Breeze - Gorgeous opening riff but soon moves into complex, fast art-punk. Great use of guitar duetting. Rating: 9/10<br />5. Eric's Trip - Sounds drug-fuelled. Very atmospheric and dark. Rating: 8/10<BR>6. Total Trash - Good, memorable but sounds similar to whats gone before it. Rating: 7/10<BR>7. Hey Joni - Ditto. Rating: 7/10<BR>8. Providence - Dark, arty, neo-classical piece blending stark piano with a spoken sample and rumblings. Different, but not much of a composition on its own. Rating; 6/10<BR>9. Candle - Opens with the most gorgeous guitar work you could imagine, then goes into good but standard DN. Wish they could have built the whole song round the intro. Rating: 10/10 (intro), 7/10 (main song)<BR>10. Rain King - The most distorted, dischordant, challenging song and with the exception of Providence the least conventional. Screaming, burning, angry, excellent. Rating: 8/10<BR>11. Kissability - Good lyrically, somewhat insubstantial musically until the last few seconds. Some of the moments of brilliance on DN are somewhat fleeting, while less inspired moments can be drawn out. Rating:6/10<BR>12. Trilogy - This song has everything you could want in its 14 minutes: straight-up rock, beauty, dischord, artiness - often all these at once. Rating: 10/10
0806930152|5.0|I own several drawing books including: Drawing A Contemporary Approach (Betti / Sale), Figure Drawing (Goldstein), The Craft of Drawing (Wood), Gray's Anatomy, Drawing on The Right Side of The Brain (Edwards). BRIDGMAN'S is bar the best purchase, and possibly the only drawing book you need to teach yourself to draw.  Let me preface that by saying, Betty Edwards book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain I also give five stars, primarially as a fantastic tool for teaching drawing, and for those beginners who are not right-brain dominant but want to draw. <br />Open to almost any page in Bridgman's and you'll see several illustrations to begin working from if you choose. Or, read from the beginning the simple text that helps break down the figure, and the figure's components, into shapes and go from there.  This book is brimming with accurate and easy to read text and anatomical poses to learn from.<br />I guarantee you, if you draw as you see in the Bridgman's book, or if you even copy every drawing in the Bridgman's book, you will draw the figure, and everything else, like a professional. This book should be on every teacher and professor's course syllabus for all drawing levels. Great tips, great tools, great reminders. Enjoy drawing!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Overall, there are a handful of excellent songs on this cd.  But, in its entirety there are a couple of misses.  I was never crazy about &quot;Cochise&quot; and its exciting that there are songs on this cd that blow that track away.  The stand out tracks have the thundering bass that both Soundgarden and Rage are known for, great drums and guitars, and Chris Cornell's amazing vocal range.<br />Some songs are very Soundgarden-like, some are very Rage-like, and a few (the ones that in my opinion are not so good) are very Cornell solo-like.  Also, there are a few vocal experiments that I think just don't work, and I am one of Chris Cornell's biggest fans, so its a tough call to make.  They are almost uncomfortable to listen to.<br />Overall, its a solid effort, and I can't wait to see them live.
B000006TRV|5.0|I liked it.  It deserves 5 stars.
0425170349|5.0|If you are in to suspenseful novels with surprising twists, this novel is for you!  From start to finish, possibly one of Tom Clancy's best. It gives details and keeps you in tune the whole time, never leaving the reader in the dark and simultaneously biulding a plot to keep any reader interested foir the duration. Very well done!
B000000OPZ|5.0|This is Whitesnake's great work of art. Every song makes you sing along and play air guitar. Even people who don't care for heavy metal liked this when I played it. Whitesnake was the best of the bands to pop up from Deep Purple alumni. This record gives Led Zeppelin a run for their money. It is even better then Van Halen's debut. John Sykes is one heck of an axe player. Neil Murrey had been im Whitesnake for it's entire career since it formed in '78. Dunbar is a decent metal drummer. Adrian Vandenburg did some guitar work on this album, and he also contributed the nicely done keyboards. A huge album, it was overshadowed by Guns N' Roses debut the same year. This is one of the best classic heavy albums of the 80's and all time.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|Like the &quot;Peaks and Valleys&quot; reviewer, I think that the only two songs that truly work on this album are &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; and &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;.  However &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; is the one that truly devastates me.  This is Johnny doing what he does best:  profoundly expressing the regret of of someone who's made a terrible mistake.  It's hard for me to believe that Sting wrote it, because it truly sounds like something Johnny would have written.  It haunts me almost as much as his previous album's &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; does.<br />As for the rest of the album:  Somehow it just doesn't work, and it's hard to put my finger on why.  American 3 had a bunch of tracks that should never have worked, but they did.  Beautifully.  As a matter of fact, all three previous American albums made me shake my head and say to myself &quot;Man, they know how to use him well.&quot;  I'm sorry to say that in the case of most of this album, they lost track of the formula.<br />With that said, American 4 is still more than worth buying just for the two tracks mentioned.  And of course other fans will find meaning in the other tracks.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Very few movies will hold my original interest on repeat viewings, but Heat is definitely one of them! Let's put aside the fact that with Pacino and DeNiro starring in the same movie, the trail is already off to a great start. This movie actually gets my heart pumping during the shoot-outs and bank scene, and also makes me really *feel* for what the characters Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro), Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cerrito (Tom Sizemore), Charlene (Ashley Judd), Eady (Amy Brenneman), etc. are going through. It's not just another \\"cops and robbers\\" story. It's deeper than that. A lot deeper. If you watch this movie and don't see anything but the crime taking place and the cops chasing the bad guys - then you've missed out. Big time! It shows the \\"other side\\" of an officer's life (problems and struggles with family issues), and the inner emotions, and even the \\"soft\\" side of the criminals. There's actually a storyline beyond the crime, and that's one of the many things that makes this movie so great!
0446310786|5.0|This is a great book! We had to read it for school, and I thought it would be boring, but it wasn't at all! This book keeps you on the end of your seat, and it hard to put down. It really touches you, too. This story is about prejudices and how a little white girl learns that the world isn't really fair towards negros. This is a book I would reccommend to everyone, of any age. It teaches a valuable lesson and is just great to read.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Listening to Brainwashed for the first time was confusing in some ways.  This album is as good or better than George's 1987 release, Cloud Nine.  It is fun to listen to with pleasant sounds in the vocals and music.  The lyrics are touched with introspection but are mostly positive as well.  But there is still that cloud of loss surrounding this album.  Listening to it seems kind of bittersweet.  Great album- sad that it is the last Harrison release (unless they find some vaulted material, of course).<br />Choosing a favorite song is difficult.  The first single was Stuck Inside A Cloud, and it deserved to be released.  It's a wonderful song musically and lyrically.  But I think the remake of Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea is probably my favorite.  The ukulele sound is stronger in this one, and I can perfectly see George smiling and enjoying playing and singing this one.  The first track, Any Road, came close to claiming status as my favorite.  It very much resembles the bouncy quality of some of the Traveling Wilburys songs.  However, the lyrics are much more profound than most Wilburys song ever attempted to be.  But that's just George being George.  This track (like most of the songs on this disc) is filled with that great slide guitar sound that Harrison had perfected.<br />The bonus dvd in this special edition version is good, but it is a bit short.  The content is a mix of Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison talking about finishing the project after George passed away and George talking about various things in his garden.  A few recording sessions appear in clips with the longest being a session of Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea.  I enjoyed everything on this dvd, but like I said, I wish it could have been a little longer.  <br />I didn't mind the extra ten dollars for the special edition at all.  It also included a poster, an official George licenced guitar pick, and a Dark Horse decal.  I like the cover of the box better in its simple elegance too, but the normal album cover is good, and the normal version is included inside just as you would find it separately.  <br />I have been waiting for about 10 years for a new George release.  It's just a shame it has to be the last.
B00006X06U|5.0|One critic has called this double-CD \\"bizarre.\\" He may be correct - it is oh-so-different. Nobody, but nobody other than Joni Mitchell could possibly have created this very unusual and notable work. On Travelogue, Mitchell revisits - and recreates - 22 of her previously recorded songs, from the folky innocence of 1968's The Dawntreader to the complex, world-weary Sire of Sorrow, from 1994. All are recorded with the ultra-sophisticated sounds of the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Vince Mendoza. The results are uniformly fascinating, though not quite uniformly fabulous. There's only one real miss, Sex Kills, and the miss results mainly from Mitchell's vocal limitations and the fact that the song is simply too street-wise to be performed by an orchestra. You can't help but notice the damage done to Mitchell's voice by smoking, and perhaps other factors, but the musical journey here is intriguing enough to overcome the shortcomings. Most enjoyable are the the jazz-pop numbers, including You Dream Flat Tires (this one swings), Trouble Child (darkly sensual and dreamy) and Be Cool. Songs from Hejira, the album that the hardest of hard core Mitchell fans call their favorite, are well-represented here: Refuge of the Roads and Amelia are lovely; Hejira has a fusion-esque, tantalizing arrangement. Some will undoubtedly claim that this set is over-orchestrated, but it's not - the orchestration is lovely and subtle when it needs to be. This CD might be a good starting point for classical or jazz fans wanting to give Mitchell a try. And by the way, the packaging on this thing is fantastic, complete with reproductions of Mitchell's September 11-inspired paintings. Travelogue - one more (and perhaps the last) fascinating step in Joni Mitchell's amazing muscial history.
0812523008|4.0|I'm not sure how I heard about this book, but I sure love the title.  It's intriguing.  So I read the novella about the last man left on Earth who fights vampires every night, and really enjoyed it.  I enjoy reading Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, the series includes some of my all-time favorite novels, and I Am Legend, although much different, was effective at creating an atmosphere of dread and despair.  The title comes into play on the very last page if I remember correctly, and the ending has stuck with me since I read the story a few months ago.<br />Matheson's story is similar to a Stephen King story, and it is interesting to see how the main character survives every day in an empty world inhabited by vampires.  I don't want to supply any plot spoilers, but the ending is fantastic, yet eery.  Anyway, if you like vampires and a decent tale, then give it a try.  Oh, the short stories included with the story are just OK.
B000003TA4|1.0|This has been hailed as one of the greatest albums ever made.... WHY??! It is a horrible album.. Nirvana are sell-outs... This is stuff that MTV and the media TELLS you is cool... Not stuff that IS cool.. You wanna hear a good album... Hear &quot;ABBEY ROAD&quot; by the Beatles.. Ya Ya... You can criticize me and say that that's been hailed as one of the greatest albums ever made too.... but the media were darn right when they chose &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.... No other song can compare to &quot;Something&quot; or &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;. The Beatles are geniuses... Nirvana are not...  Stop ranting and raving about Kurt Cobain being dead.... So what if he committed suicide? It's over and done with!  Move on! We've got alot more things in life to worry about!
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book!  It's beautifully written with believable characters and a real sense of what loss can mean to the living. I cried an entire plane trip, not just as I finished reading it but afterwards when I thought about it.  I hope that anyone who has lost someone reads it and feels accompanied.  I loved Ruana and Grandma, made me wish I was closer to home.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I am priveleged to be the first to review this CD. It is quite simply some of George Harrisons finest work. I was scared and skeptical because usually posthumous releases are weak at best and are things that should have stayed on the cutting room floor...This album is NOT like that..IT IS BRILLIANT. Its the best thing since \\"All things Must Pass\\" and if you liked the wilburys a little bit...you will LOVE this album. The lyrics are powerful, thoughtful, and fun. The music has that sweet slide guitar that can bring a tear to your eye.  The title track Brainwashed is vintage Harrison with the Indian chants and all. The first song \\"any road\\" is a wilbury song all the way. Beautiful heartwrenching songs like \\"pieces fish\\" and \\"stuck in a cloud\\" will blow you away. I also love \\"run so far\\".  All in all i can't say enough good things about this CD. If you are a beatles, harrison, wilburys, dylan, petty, or ELO fan.. or just appreciate great musicianship and songwriting played by real humans with real instruments...BUY THIS CD!
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman's new fantasy novel, American Gods, is filled with myth, magic and disturbing insights into American values. The novel is well-written, fast-paced and entertaining. Gaiman (Neverwhere, Stardust) creates believable characters in unbelievable circumstances.<br />The story begins with Shadow, a man finishing a three-year sentence in prison, who wants only to return to his loving wife, Laura. Two days before he is to be released, the warden tells Shadow that his wife and best friend were killed in a car crash, and releases Shadow early for the funeral.<br />On the flight home, Shadow meets a mysterious old man that says he has been waiting for him. The man, who introduces himself as Mr. Wednesday, knows Shadow's name and many intimate details about his life. Mr. Wednesday offers Shadow a job as a bodyguard and errand boy. Shadow reluctantly agrees, since the job he had lined up for himself after prison died with his best friend.<br />At the funeral, Shadow and Wednesday begin a cross-country adventure on which Shadow discovers that Wednesday is really Odin, the All-Father of the Norse religion, brought to America by the Vikings. Wednesday is trying to unite the other \\"old gods\\" in America for a battle against the new gods of technology like television, the media and the Internet.<br />Throughout the novel, Shadow becomes acquainted with American versions of gods from various religions. With no one making sacrifices to the gods or even believing in them, the gods became weak and had to find work, buy homes and start lives. The Queen of Sheba works as a prostitute; Wednesday is a con artist; and Mr. Ibis is an undertaker.<br />Gaiman's idea that gods are only as powerful as the belief in them is reminiscent of Small Gods by Terry Prachett, with whom Gaiman co-wrote the novel Good Omens.<br />The writing is descriptive and reflects Gaiman's dry sense of humor. \\"Shadow had heard of men who were barrel-chested before, but he had no image to accompany the metaphor. This man was barrel-chested, and he had legs, yes, like tree trunks, and hands like, exactly, ham hocks.\\"<br />Gaiman's writing talent humanizes and brings life to his characters, even the dead ones. \\"Laura looked up at him with dead eyes. `I want to be alive again,' she said. `Not in this half-life. I want to be really alive. I want to feel blood moving through me- hot, salty, and real. It's weird, you don't think you can feel it, the blood, but believe me, when it stops flowing, you'll know.'\\"<br />American Gods will satisfy both Gaiman fans and newcomers to his work.man was barrel-chested, and he had legs, yes, like tree trunks, and hands like, exactly, ham hocks.\\"<BR>Gaiman's writing talent humanizes and brings life to his characters, even the dead ones. \\"Laura looked up at him with dead eyes. `I want to be alive again,' she said. `Not in this half-life.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Big Rage fan, bigger Soundgarden fan, and I was eagerly awaiting this one.  I had hyped it up so much in my mind, I just had so many expectations for this, it would have been impossible for this album to have met those expectations . . . but it did.<br />Real quickly, Track 12, Tom Morello's guitar work went a little loopy.  I love his work, but it sounds better when it actually sounds like it's part of the song and not somebody just throwing in something &quot;cool.&quot;<br />Other than that, I loved every second of it.  I listened to it 5 times yesterday, I'm sure I'll listen to it 5 times today . . . this is just bombastic blues-rock.  No metal.  No rap or hip hop.  Blues-based rock, that's all this is.  Great stuff.  Good real rock is so hard to find these days.<br />Buy this record.  If you're a rock fan, you like Zeppelin, Sabbath, Rage, Soundgarden, Aerosmith, this is a must own.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I went looking for a DVD one night and saw Scooby Doo in Full Screen.  I wasn't going to purchase it because I don't like watching DVD's in Full Screen.  I decided to dig a little and didn't fine a Wide Screen version, so I was going to wait it off.<br />I was looking around the section a little more and found another stack of Scooby Doo's, and again, they were Full Screen.  I decided to look through the entire pile still, because I was hopeful.  Surprisingly, I found a Wide Screen version.  Of course I picked it up.  I'm a fan of the cartoon (who isn't?), and I also enjoy Sarah Michelle Gellar as an actress.  <br />So I went to a friends house and watched the DVD.  It was quite enjoyable.  It had very amusing parts, and it was quite reminiscent of the original cartoon series.  The story was very fun and it wasn't one of those movies that kept you glued to your seat, but it was one of those movies that kept you laughing and smiling and enjoying the entire experience.<br />I was actually surprised, because as I was watching it, I felt like I was a child again watching a Scooby Doo cartoon on a bright, sunny Saturday morning.  The acting wasn't Academy Award worthy, but it was good enough to make you enjoy the movie.  Scooby Doo and his antics are always amusing and it's always fun watching Mystery, Inc. solve a mystery.<br />All in all, I thought this was a really good movie, and definitely a film the entire family should watch.  The bonus material on the DVD isn't fulfilling, but it will keep you satisfied and keep the movies appeal alive.
B000067DNC|5.0|I love this show and am thrilled to get this on DVD finally. I missed a lot of the past couple seasons so I can't wait until they come out as well. The best part is that the show is seamless. normally when they release tv shows, they fade to black for a few seconds where the commercials are usually inserted. In the stargate dvd's, it flows seamlessly. We watched about 7 episodes in one night when we first got it. :)
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I searched far and wide for this one and I must say that I am so happy that my search ended. I can't say enough about this cd. I love it. It has to be one of the best CD's in my collection. Ray sounds great and Jake shreds it up. MY favorite song is fat cat. Jake's solo is awesome. If you like Badlands or just the blues this cd is a must have. If you have trouble finding it, look to zrecords they will help you. Later all
B00005JKCH|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the original Batman, Spider-Man is by far the best of the superhero movies.  In the Superman series of movies, an over emphasis was placed on the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent.  An identical problem occured with Batman.  Spider-man however, while still featuring the obligatory love interest of the superhero, didn't sacrifice other parts of the story.  It made it a great movie for anyone, whether they are the diehard action movie buff, or love story fanatic.<br />The special effects are another subject all together.  They simply have to be seen to be believed.  No more glibly swinging through city streets as in the old cartoon.  Instead, we are able to see the power and strength required as Spider-man traverses the city.  It's great to see that special effects people for once, decided to pay attention to an often neglected law: physics.
B00006RU5B|5.0|What can I say.. this album absolutely knocked my socks off.  What one expects from a Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine joint venture is not what it delivers.. its altogether different than expected, and so much better.  From the hard rock of &quot;Cochise&quot; to the quiet splendor of &quot;Like a Stone&quot; this is the first album I have heard all year that I don't have the urge to hit SKIP on any of the tracks.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I was a fan of RATM. I was a fan of Soundgarden. The idea of &quot;Rage with Cornell on vocals&quot; sounded like it might work. However, the reality is that some of the songs sound vaguely like Rage, while the rest sound a lot like Chris Cornell solo , or some of the mellower Soundgarden stuff from their later albums. Not really what I wanted. Hopefully it'll grow on me.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera really comes into her own on her sophomore CD.  Showcasing her amazing vocal talents along with her surprisingly good writing skills, she lays her heart and soul on every track!  My favorites are Can't Hold Us Back, Infatuation, Beautiful, Fighter, Impossible, I'm OK, Dirrty and Loving Me 4 Me.  I definitely recommed this as a present for any music lover for the holidays- heck, better yet, treat yourself!! You'll be glad you did! = )
B00006LSM3|5.0|To say that \\"Brainwashed\\" is an important release is an understatement.  Not only is this Harrison's first studio collection since 1987's \\"Cloud Nine\\", but it also the last.  That being said, there is enough here to make the collection essential.  \\"Any Road\\", \\"Looking for My Life\\", \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" and \\"(Can Only) Run So Far\\" are all beautiful and heartfelt compositions, displaying Harrison's guitar virtuosity and his coming to terms with life and death.  Add to the recipe the magical intrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", the playful rendition of \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" and the title track, with its moving closing prayer.  This is Harrison's gift, his giving back a little of what was taken away by his death in 2001.  \\"If you don't know where you're going,\\" writes Harrison, \\"any road will take you there.\\"  If George Harrison's music and words were a vital part of your musical diet, help yourself to a final serving.
0440234743|4.0|Book does an excellent job of portraying the emptiness of money.  On one hand you have the spoiled heirs who have had every need met.  Contrasted to the heirs is Rachel Lane, a missionary who lives in stone age conditions, but is happy.  Nate O'Reilly moves between both worlds.    One  theme is, Rachel , the heir, has no interest in the money, the other disinheritied heirs are consumed by it, to their downfall.    Good characterization, as expected from Grisham.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you're looking to get your [rear] kicked, I recommend two methods: flirt with your buff neighbor's wife, or listen to \\"Audioslave.\\" Both work equally well, but there's a certain element of enjoyment contained in the latter method, one which should not be ignored. Audioslave, comprised of ex-Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell and three former memebrs of the ultra-political and enormously underrated band Rage Against the Machine, have come together to from rock's next bigh thing: a throwback to \\"the old thing.\\" Every song on \\"Audioslave\\" reaks of 1970's hard rock, from Led Zep to, well.....Led Zep! But believe you me, this band does more than just model itself after an older, more famous band (stupid garage rock revival! Arrgh!) This band expands upon the sonic assault of classic riff-rock, adding doses of nu-metal and hand-clapping funk. Songs such as \\"Cochise\\" and Gasoline\\" see the band explode with an inspiring level of energy, while other tracks like \\"I am the Highway\\" and \\"Getaway Car\\" see the band at its most sober. In short, Audioslave sounds like a mix between Led Zeppelin, Stone Temple Pilots, and AC/DC. What more could a rock fan ask for?

0064407667|5.0|This book is an excallent book along with the other 8 books. This makes you want to read on and never stop. I personally went crazy until the 9th book came out and will be crazy until the 10th is out. Lemony Snicket talks to the reader with his own made up personal experience and explains things. If you have read Harry Potter, I highly suggest these books! To learn more before reading them.
B00006G8HX|4.0|The real winner in this set is the text commentary option for the film, as written by Michael Okuda (whose visuals have made the franchise's view of the future so interesting)
B00006JDVV|4.0|I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was out in the theaters and thinking to myself, &quot;oh what a bunch of garbage.&quot;  I can't remember who finally convinced me to see it, but I did and I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is a little more believable than you would think and the characters are great.  Matthew McConaughey plays a great character.  You'll never forget him in this role, I promise you.  It's a good flick for a light night's entertainment.
B00006RU5B|5.0|All i can say is anyone who liked Rage or Soundgarden will love this cd.  At times it is quiet and at times is load and aggressive.  Gasoline, What you are, Cochise, and I am the Highway are some of my favorites.
B000066NW0|5.0|You ppl that are here complaining bout how Avril is not punk or she's just co-writes the music, let me tell you something. Youre not judging her music, your judging her image. And i have to admitt i do judge image, thats why i like her, coz shes not another girl that goes out on panties and a bra just to sell records. Shes a better role-model and i like her lyrics a lot. even if there co-writed, some artist doesnt even know what there singing about. Her lyrics are REAL. thats why i like them. And she sings well.

B00004R99I|1.0|---<br />Yeah, it's Disney.  Yeah, it's something in front of which brain-dead yuppies are supposed to be able to seat their larvae so as to keep the little weasels from messing with daddy's Sharper Image catalog while mommie goes through her aerobics routine, trying to wipe out those stretch marks.  Yeah, it's yet another one of those Great Amurrican Myths that we're all supposed to internalize, about the beautiful Injun princess and the handsome young English soldier.  Yeah.<br />Of course, the image doesn't get maintained once you take the kids on that week-end trip to the Jamestown historic site and they discover that the Tidewater stomping grounds of the Powhatan Confederacy consists of flat alluvial plains with no cliffs or picturesque waterfalls off which to make impressive dives, that Pocahontas was only the young lady's nickname (meaning &quot;playful&quot; or &quot;little wanton&quot; in Algonquinian), and that no matter what's just around the river bend, you wind up in the Chesapeake Bay.<br />You'll find that it grits in your wife's craw as you explain to your grandkids that when John Smith and Pocahontas met in 1607, he was about 27 and she was perhaps 10 or 12 years old, that they were friends but never fell in love with one another, and that her role in &quot;saving&quot; John Smith's life was part of a ritual of mock execution-and-rescue traditional among Algonquin tribes at the time.  Big romance, right?  Yeah.<br />&quot;All this stuff in the movie is made-up Disney mush,&quot; you explain.  &quot;The English came here expecting to set up farms and develop a self-sustaining colony after an earlier attempt at Roanoke had failed because of a horrible drought.  They were after land, not gold, and if you think everything ended up peaceful and happy with everybody getting along together, you've got another think coming.&quot;<br />Yeah, but it's *Disney*.  Yeesh.<br />---

B00006YXEK|5.0|There are always a few re-occurring themes throughout George Harrison's solo years, the never-ending search for spiritual guidance, social responsibilities, and trying to escape his Beatles past. The first two are most definitely all over this record, many times intertwined trying to answer one from the other. The third is pleasantly not nearly as present as previous records, seeming to signal that George finally came to terms with his 'fab' history, which his previous effort, 'Cloud Nine', seemed to signal.<br />Right away the album feels very familiar with the lead off track 'Any Road' floating in a sea of the trademark slide guitar sound and Harrison's brand of tongue-in-cheek humor Zen-isms \\"Oh Lord We Pay the Price / Spin of a Wheel - With the Roll of a Dice / And if You Don't Know Where You're Going / Any Road Will Take You There\\". And that's the kind of things that myself personally have grown to love and admire about George is that he's able to inject his sly sense of humor while at the same time getting his message across without getting too preachy, which was a negative on some of later 70s output.<br />Harrison's trademark guitar sound is all over this record and it's as lively and fresh as ever. The instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\" is a testament to the poignant work of Harrison on his guitars as he never seems to waste a note throughout. Nearly every song is layered with Harrison's guitar on top of his acoustic track. The floating notes of 'Stuck Inside a Cloud' literally give the feeling of the title.<br />It's almost sad to listen to because it's obviously a man writing down himself coming to terms of his own fate, which he knows is coming all too soon, or maybe not soon enough for him. The title track comes off as a personal mantra, with Harrison hoping God will leave us through the ever mixed up world of money, media, and mobile phones. It's no secret he was a bit of a recluse, more worried about his gardens than his legacy. As he says himself \\"I go outside my gates and I wonder what the hell I'm doing here\\". It harkens back to \\"Awaiting on You All \\" from 1970's 'All Things Must Pass,' which proves to be all that much more true today.<br />Simply put, a more than ample swan song from rock's great mystic, George Harrison. He never seemed to change, but the world around him did quite a bit, too much for his taste. Even to the end the strength he pulled from his beliefs allowed him to face any task head on with his unique brand of humor and taste. And it really shows on this record, which was made in his dying days with the aid of his son, who in his later years was his best friend and he his son's. I'm mostly glad to see that the last reminder we're going to get from this most classy  man is such a class-act itself.tside my gates and I wonder what the hell I'm doing here\\".

0375414053|1.0|I wnated to like this book so much- a working woman, balancing motherhood with a rewarding career, blah, blah, blah.  But Kate Reddy was just so unlikeable.  Not funny at all, in fact, just depressing and whiney.  ugh, those stupid lists of stuff on her to do list were painful.  My advice-  stick to Bridget Jones- at least she has a sense of humor!
B00006LSM3|5.0|I bought this and the enhanced version yesterday (11/19).  I didn't know what to expect.  I knew that Jeff Lynne was going to have a hand in it, si I knew that was good.  On the DVD,Lynne says how George wanted it be more simple and not alot to it, but Jeff Lynne thought the songs were too good to be left alone like that. He was right.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is fantastic album.  Great writing and melodies.  Dhani, Lynne, and Keltner have added terrific ingredients to an awesome album.  My favorite tunes so far are: \\"Any Road\\", \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" and \\"Brainwashed.\\" I'm sure in the coming weeks I'll get to know them all better.  Everyone may not like this album, because it is not as commerical as \\"Cloud Nine\\" was.  But thank you George for being strong enough at the time to put these songs on tape for us!  We miss you.
B00006LSM3|4.0|It's a wonderful record. 40 something minutes of great guitar,<BR>vocals and songs.This just may be the greatest solo Beatle record since Paul's Band On The Run.

It's one of the most emotional things<BR>I've ever heard..........
B00000ILDF|5.0|Alien 3 is the final chapter of the great sci-fi trilogy, and without a doubt the best of all 3 films. Director David Fincher takes us not into a horror world of aliens like Ridley scott did in the first film, not into an actionpacked bulletfest like James Cameron did in the second film, but a great mix of the 2 with a Chocolate coating of \\"dark\\" layered all over it. <BR>The film starts with Ellen Ripley's ship crash landing on a remote planet where she is still in hypersleep after the second film, she's found and brought back to a station that's used to hold the most diabolical sinical criminals in the universe, sort of like an Alcatraz+. One of the small alien parasites makes it onto the planet and empregnates a dog to which later 1 Alien is born. The parasite has also empregnated Ellen Ripley herself as she later discovers. So now the Alien rieks havoc among the prisoners, killing them one by one.<BR>The best thing about this film is the setting, it's very dark,dirty and truly believeable, so you yourself feel as if you've been taken onto planet Hell. The actors are excellent and Segourney Weaver gives another amazing performance as Ripley. <BR>The next best thing about this film is that the prisoners don't have guns or any automatic weapons, so it's going to take sheer intelligence to figure out how to kill this Alien. The film pulls you in and never lets you go, it's not too long, it's not too short, the script is excellent, the films editing is clean and superbly done, and it's just overall very entertaining. It then takes you to what I think is the best ending to any film series ever made. <BR>Any respectable sci-fi/horror fan must own this series, it's definitely a classic and will live on and be talked about for decades to come. I love this movie!
B00005QDW1|1.0|OK, we know No Doubt is a good band. Tragic Kingdom was all kinds of fun. It had a great punk/ska feel. Return of Saturn was amazing! It was one of my 2 top-rated CDs. It was fun sometimes, but thoughtful also and very mature. In light of the fact the No Doubt has so much talent, I have to ask: What are they trying to pull?<br />First of all, theyre the most major sell-outs in the music business. This is absolute pop. It isnt even worthy of the title pop-rock, just pop. There were warning signs, what with Gwen Stefani going on Eve videos wearing virtually nothing and other such things, but this...If you just exchanged Britney Spears for Gwen Stefani in her latest videos, it would fit PERFECTLY, the difference being that Gwen doesnt have implants (yet). The song Hey Baby is an abomination, no less. <br />Secondly, the music. Middle-school dances and pop radio stations around the world rejoice, you just got several new songs to play OVER and OVER until fans of real music are smashing their speakers. Hey Baby isnt just a hit to make the record sell, its very representative of the whole CD, by which I mean synthesized to the point of being fake. Where Return of Saturn was pretty deep, this is just ludicrously shallow. (\\"And the girls say/girls say/Hey baby, hey baby, hey/And the boys say/boys say...\\") I could cry.<br />Last, the band, Gwen not included. Why are they even still there? They play, but due to synthesizer it just doesnt sound genuine, and with the pathetic amount of spotlight theyre getting, I doubt anybody, even Gwen, would notice if they all just sort of evaporated. People who hadnt heard of No Doubt but had the radio on would seriously think it was just some pop star, not a band, playig Hey Baby. I didnt know that song was No Doubt the first time I heard it. Underneath it All is the least shallow and therefore closest to old No Doubt song on the CD, and the video is so bad its almost like theyre trying to make the one good song look like trashy pop like all the rest.<br />So my verdict is, this makes me sick. Who would have thought the mighty would fall so far! The worst part is, this is their best selling CD. They (Gwen) sold out 100% and were ENCOURAGING it! Pop fans should LOVE this CD, but old No Doubt fans, or fans who like real music at all, should not waste their money. If you dont have their old CDs, GO BUY THOSE! Leave this one alone.<br />Closing Comments:The way Gwen dresses, I get the feeling she thinks shes hot stuff. Somebody ought to wake her up.
B00000ILDE|4.0|Aliens is without a doubt one of the best action/sci-fi films ever made. Director James Cameron takes us more into an action oriented Alien movie then the horror-esque type of the first film, and it's done extremely well, engrossing you (for the most part) from the first scene, to the very last. Although saying all of this, it's not perfect. <BR>Aliens opens 57 years after the end of the first film, where Lieutenent Ripley (Segourney Weaver) is found by a salvage team in deep space during her hypersleep, she's taken aback to a station where she's revoked of her Pilot status because of the destruction of the ship of the first film. She is asked to accompany a crew of marines to another planet where a colony of many families is being tested because contact with them has been lost, the plan is to wipe out any surviving Aliens on that planet who are thought to be the ones that killed them, and hopefully rescue any survivors. The rest is self explanatory. <BR>The best thing about this film is the script,and with the new extended special edition we get more into Ellen Ripley's character. There isn't much else except for a few more lost scenes with only about 17 minutes of extra film. The characters act very well and are very much believeable as marines, but the settings are a little too propy and not completely believable which goes to show the budget must not have been very high. And the Aliens themselves,even though still creepy and slimy, seem to move kind of jerky, so you can tell they're just animatronics. Also, even though Camerons directing was excellent in terms of characterization and cinematography, the overall films directing and editing seems somewhat sloppy, especially during the battle scenes. It's just hard to sometimes tell what exactly is going on, but you'll get the jist of it. And with the film running at 154 minutes, the film seems about 10 minutes too long, no big deal though. <BR>These are all minor quirks, if Cameron had just a little more directingexperience and the budget was a little higher, this could've been an absolutely mindblowing film. Keep in mind it's still great for its time and the drabby \\"sloppyness\\" of the film somewhat helps it at times. I myself find Aliens very riveting and entertaining. The trilogy is a classic saga that can run with other great trilogys such as Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings, and Aliens definietly does the trilogy great justice. The movie kicks serious ...! If you're a sci-fi fan, there is absolutely no reason in the world not to own this movie and the 2 others that go along with it.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's \\"Brainwashed,\\" is the most beautiful surprise, from a man who has not put out a new album in about 15 years! The slide guitar tears your heart out and George's voice is brilliant and YES, Strong!! (Especially in \\"Pisces Fish.\\")<BR>\\"The Rising Sun,\\" is to me one of the most beautiful things to hear! And the words...run deep inside. With tracks that range from the chipper toetapping (good words again)\\"Any Road,\\" to \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud,\\" and \\"Never Get Over You\\" (for Olivia)<BR>to the driving beat of \\"Brainwashed\\" itself, This album deserves<BR>all the Listening it can get!! And the more you listen the more you hear. So here is to 'open ears' and hearts. The Sun is Shining and  \\"I say, 'It's All Right, Little Darlin'!\\"
B00006YXEK|5.0|It's a wonderful cd. Having read that Jeff Lynne's production ran counter to George's wish that the album not be too \\"posh,\\" I was happy to find the production pretty understated.<br />Is the \\"limited edition\\" worth the extra money? I think so. The dvd, which is identified on the packaging as a \\"dvd single,\\" is a mini-documentary (very mini) on the making of the album. The chance to see a short clip of George and company on Harold Arlen's \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" (George on uke) is alone worth the price of admission.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first heard Cornell hooking up with the Rage Band, I as well had my doubts - But they were all proven wrong, this CD is amazing. Chris Cornell's voice/singing brings class back into rock. The members of the band show there true colors, now swaying away from that monotone &quot;Fight the System&quot; style they had when Zack was headman - Tom Morello, Timmy C, and Brad Wilks finally show that they can put out classical rock beats. <br />Tom Morello -. He keeps his signature guitar sound, which I absolutely love about Morello - He has the &quot;distinct&quot; guitar sound that differs from everything you hear on the radio. And along with that, he brings back his creative, well-slapped together solos that I have been missing since Rage departed. <BR>Timmy C - is probably one of the most underrated basses ever (along with Tool's Justin C.) Him and Tom, like they did in Rage, coordinate very well together - He as well has &quot;distinct&quot; bass sound that differs from a lot of other bands. His bass lines flows so perfect with AudioSlave. He has definitely stepped up to the plate and improved. <BR>Brad Wilks - I have always thought of him as just an average drummer, and when playing alongside guys like Tom and Tim, it's hard to be the spotlight in drumming. His style hasn't changed much, although when I heard the song &quot;Hypnotize&quot; It reassured me that he does have the capabilities to do more then just keep a beat. <BR>Chris Cornell - The once lead singer of the grunge band SoundGarden, shows his 38 year old voice can still out-due any other rock voice on the radio. Not only did he do vocals for this album, but I also hear he helped write some bridges for the album when the Rage band was stumped. <br />There are a few songs on this album that stood out quite well to me, and are my personal favorites. &quot;Hypnotize&quot; was quite a shocker to me, the techno style drumming by Brad is really awesome, and Tom and Tim put together a nice flowing style to complement it, and Cornell's voice kind of gives off a eerie feeling. &quot;Like a Stone&quot; I'm sure is the favorite for SoundGarden fans - This song reminds me of SoundGarden, just with the Rage tone; but I really like it, the solo is also very cool. &quot;Exploder&quot; is a hard-hitting track that I really love. &quot;Cochise&quot;, the hit-single is just a constant headbanging song. &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; give out the head-nodding beats that make you wanna sing along. &quot;Getaway Car&quot; &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot; &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; are the slow, more paced out songs, but they are wonderful for just relaxing in your room. Chris sings beautifully on these 3 tracks (if you didn't like his voice in Cochise, then give these 3 songs a try). Timmy C does a flat-out awesome bass line in &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; which probably is my #1 favorite track on this whole CD. &quot;Light my Way&quot; reminds me of the 80's for some reason, perhaps it's just the way Cornell sings that chorus, but this song is sweet - The chorus is addicting and reminds me of &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;. &quot;Set if Off&quot; has grown on me, it didn't have much appeal at first, but the more I listen to it the more I gain an appreciation for it, especially the intro, which is just classical Tom. &quot;What you Are&quot; is extremely radio friendly, wouldn't be surprised if this is the second single the radio plays. &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot; is an interesting song - The intro is very smooth, the chorus is nice, but I think Tom overdid it with the Amp Feedback on the solo; that and the voice effects on Chris didn't seem to do it for me. Other then those two things, the song is actually very good, and is growing on me. <br />Rating for entire CD: 9/10 - Lots of variety; blows away a lot of the 'garbage' on the radio today. It's hard to determine where 'exactly' to place this CD, it's certainly better then anything Papa Roach, Linkin Park, POD, Disturbed, etc. will ever put out. I would probably place this CD in the same category that Incubus or System of a Down is in; its not &quot;revolutionary&quot; but certainly the best darn album I have heard this year - If you are like me, and thought this year was a disappointing year for Rock, heh, this album fixes that. This band is definitely here to stay, and will also put on a great live show, considering every sound you hear on this CD is done with guitar, drum, bass, and vocals - No samples, no keyboards. I'm sure RATM fans are aware of that already.
B00006JKLI|5.0|Picked this up yesterday. It is fantastic when compared to the CD version. The vocals especially are so clear that it is like having Jon and Chris in the room with you. The most impressive track is Heart Of The Sunrise. The way the instruments and vocals have been placed in the surrounds is perfect for this type of music. Stereo and CD's are truly dead in my mind. This is the format of the future. It's like listening to the original tapes but better! No hiss. Close to the Edge is their next disc being released on DVD-A. I can't wait!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Let me start off by saying, this album rocks.  Usually, these so called &quot;super-group&quot; collaborations don't work out very well, with the exception of Cream, but this album does and does rather well.   It combines one of the great rock n' roll voices of the past decade with one of the most unique bands in recent memory.  The raunchy groove throught the record along with the waling vocals makes for one hell of a ride.  Standout tracks include; Cochise, Gasoline, Show Me How To Live, What You Are and Exploder.  Of all the tracks on the record there are two weak ones (maybe they are growers).  If you are any kind of fan of rock n' roll this is a must have.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Though never Rage nor Soundgarden, Audioslave is better than anything else out there right now.  Hard, true, honest rock in a time of Creed and other phoney bands. Buy this Album its the best thing out there by far.
B000069AUI|5.0|Wow, what can I say. Coldplay's new album A Rush of Blood to the Head completely blew me away. When I first heard the song Yellow from Coldplay in 2000 I decided to check out Parachutes. That made me a devoted fan! Spies, Trouble, Don't Panic, Yellow and most of the other songs were just incredible in my book. Now with their new album they have truly shown how talented they are with the hypnotic Clocks, the rockin opener Politik, their first single In My Place, the outstanding piano-laden The Scientist (Which is probably the best song) and Amsterdam which was amazing. The only song I didn't really like was Daylight. Besides that, this album is a masterpiece. In the direction these guys are heading musically I expect them to be around for a long time. Buy this and Parachutes ASAP!
1586210912|1.0|The book contains some good basic advice.  Using his definitions of \\"assets\\" and \\"liabilities\\", he teaches the reader to use their money to  invest in assets (thing that create money) and not liabilities (things that dont create money).  The rest of the book is little stories and antidotes supporting this concept.<BR>I give it a 1 because there is little or no real world practical advice on how to actually do anything.  Extensive research on the author reveals that his knowledge of things financial is virtually non existant.  He is making all his money off of the sales of these books which started by selling them to Amway representitives at conventions...  <BR>I love truth, I hate Liers.
B00006YXEK|5.0|I popped in George Harrison's \\"Brainwashed\\" on the way home from Borders and darn near burst into tears.  Easily one of the best albums he ever recorded.  The production by Jeff Lynne(ELO) and Dhani Harrison is impeccable.  The sound is very similar to \\"Cloud Nine\\", but perhaps a bit less \\"produced\\".  The songs are such that before you finish one you're already singing along with the words.  The first single, \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" is just a gorgeous little ditty that deserves radio airplay at a time when teen pop and rap rule the airwaves.  The album is a breath of fresh air. Unlike most albums you buy, there are no \\"clinkers\\".  Every song is pretty and singable (with the exception of the instrumental, which is just beautiful).  George's slide playing is solid and assured.  What strikes me most is the fact that, despite his health at the time of the recording, the album is so positive and life-affirming.  This is one of those sunny day CD's that will lift your mood and put you in a positive frame of mind.  I've listened to this 4 times in a row today and I think I'll just keep letting it play.  I guess the 15 year wait was worth it, it's just a shame that we'll have no more forthcoming.  The enhanced CD has a short (too short) DVD that briefly discusses the making of the album with all the principals involved.  You also get a guitar pick (as a guitar player I treasure this little trinket), mini-poster (with a lovely picture of George on the flip side) and a Dark Horse decal.  My only complaint is the black packaging which I completely overlooked. Thanks to your staff for making me aware of the enhanced version.  Any Beatles fan should treasure this record.
B000002UA0|1.0|I can't believe people are giving this 5 stars.  It's the worst pink floyd album I've ever heard.
B00006LLNU|2.0|The incandescent beauty of Sigur Ros's gtis Byrjun was in the roiling aimlessness of its soundscapes - the span of melodies that sustained and mutated and ebbed so slowly they never seemed to be going anywhere.  Yet move they did, until they arrived - undeniable as a glacier - with breathtaking crescendos.  The ugly secret of the music was the schlock beneath the austere surface.  Jon Thor Birgisson may have been singing in a made up language, precluding literal meaning, but the songs themselves, built on big hooks and rapturous choruses, signified with emotional intensity.  ( ), their third release, is intensely mediocre.  Songs last for an eternity.  Melodies are replaced with \\"atmospheres\\" - tonal noodling in a limited modal range.  The vocals are often choral in nature, slurred and layered, like the music of the spheres.  They are so grand, apparently, they don't feel the need to title their songs.  (Or their CD, for that matter.)  Track 4 and Track 8 have some of the same majesty as gtis Byrjun.  Otherwise, it's a long tedious trek across a snowy tundra.
6302902010|3.0|It was just okay.  That's all.
B00006IU73|5.0|While listening to Porcupine Tree's seventh release In Absentia, you'll be forgiven if you hear echoes of Genesis, Jethro Tull, Yes, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, the Moody Blues, ELP, Crack the Sky, The Church, Sigur Ros, and even, for christ's sake, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  This UK group are unapologetic prog-rockers.  And why should they apologize when they put out records as striking as In Absentia?  These twelve tracks are complex yet never confusing.  Steve Wilson's multi-tracked voice is gentle yet assertive.  The subject matter is the usual prog-rock stuff - space travel, messiah complexes, myth - yet never obnoxious or pompous.  The songs compress motifs and ideas into manageable lengths - they feel epic but not oppressively long.  In short, they're a smart progressive outfit to join the ranks of a contemporary movement including latter-day Church, Elbow, Radiohead, etc.
B0000507R0|1.0|Bummer! Besides the 9 audio tracks that offer a great signal/noise ratio and surround experience, all the rest of the material is not accessible if you use a DVD Video player...which I guess is owned by 99.9% of the DVD-owner population out there. Unlike another DVD-Audio I have from Yes (Magnification), the visual content of this ELP DVD-Audio is not compatible with &quot;any player&quot; with a DVD logo. I cannot open the photo gallery, lyrics, audio interview and album essay!<br />Nothing to do with ELP and the B.S.S. record, which I own in CD and love. But this DVD-Audio disc cover and most ads for it on online retailers are misleading in terms of compatibility with DVD Video players.
048623231X|5.0|I have a horrible confession to make: I much prefer to look at Gustave Dore's fantastic and grotesque scenes depicting Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; with just appropriate lines from the Longfellow translation then have to deal with all those tercets.  Even worse, I think these 135 illustrations from the 1861 edition comprise Dore's best body of work, even better than his famous Bible illustrations completed five years later, mainly because I think Dore's style is better suited to the depths of Hell and the realms of Purgatory, rather than the stories of the Bible.  Clearly Dore found his kindred soul mate in Dante and even though he did classic engravings to illustrate everything from &quot;Don Quixote&quot; to &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&quot; this is his monumental achievement.  Many admirers like the plates depicting the souls writhing in the fiery torments of Hell, but my favorite has to do with the lower level of hell where Dante and Virgil encounter the souls frozen in ice (Canto XXXII).  This Dover edition is relatively inexpensive, which means the paper quality is geared towards economy rather than reproduction, but I think that it a satisfactory tradeoff, all things considered.
B00006L3S3|5.0|I need John Lennon to make day bright. I grow up on Beatle and still find music to give me life every day. This CD sound so clear and improve of the old standard. Thank you Miss Yoko for letting the spirit of music live on. We play One Day at a Time to help our daily journey of peace and survival. The first song on album is almost a mantra of our existence. I'm Sorry is soft plea to unrequited love. Out the Blue is standout song with pretty melody and lyrical vow to wife. Many Beatle fan enjoy this song of all. I Know bring light to a dark world and lift your heart from sadness. Beatle songs speak in this way. Music is gift even after singer has left world. Love through lyrics and light through music. We listen with joy.
B00006X06U|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I am a guy in his twenties who regularly attends concerts put on by local hardcore metal bands. I love hardcore. But I love everything else as well. I'll be the guy at the Killswitch Engage concert wearing a Joni Mitchell t-shirt. <br />There's a simple reason for that. Joni Mitchell is a consummate artist, in the truest sense of the word. She lives and breathes art, she pours her heart and soul into every thing she does, be it painting, photography, writing, composing, or those breathtakingly original guitar tunings. I myself am a guitarist who's trying to learn some of those funky tunings. <br />\\"Travelogue\\" is the second of Joni's albums on which she is backed by a full orchestra. There are 22 tracks, 2 discs. Each song is a re-recording of one of her old songs, with an all-new arrangement for orchestra. And I mean wow. Dude, she blows you away with this.<br />Some fans have complained because she can't sing soprano anymore like she could back in the '60's. I'd like to ask those folks; does your voice sound the same now as it did forty years ago? No. People age, and things change. Granted, Joni smokes. But she's also older, and I personally prefer this voice. This voice is more suited to sing certain songs, like \\"The Circle Game,\\" \\"The Sire of Sorrow,\\" and \\"Hejira.\\" This is the voice of experience.<br />My only gripe? Joni doesn't play any guitar on this album, which is a shame. But it's not a detriment to the recording, just a wish. Everything about this recording is incredible, from the innovative packaging, to the new arrangements, and those brilliant paintings. I enjoy the paintings inspired by September 11, but I'm really fond of the one on the cover; a self-portrait with Joni's face half in shadow, and surrounded by a cloud of politically incorrect cigarette smoke.<br />Basically, buy this album. Come on. Hear a true artist at work.
B000005JA8|1.0|It's so incrediby tiresome to read page after page of fawning reviews about this tripe.  Don't fall for it.  Van Vliet himself calls it &quot;a joke&quot;.  Don't let it be on you.
B000002ITM|2.0|To tell you the truth about this CD,it's an analogy of Metallica's \\"The Black Albumn\\" in that their music really began to stink afterwards.This is where Testament went from an excellent underground thrash-metal to a mainstream hard-rock band.I found the music a drastic contrast to their earlier works...especially when you listen to their albumns such as \\"The Legacy\\" and this one and make the comparison.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that they simply became a sell-out to their true thrash-metal fans...like me.And what makes it worst...they went ahead and tried to go death-metal with their later works...
B00006CXXU|4.0|I am being very lenient giving this album 4 stars.  It probably deserves 3 but I applaud Christina Aguilera's desire to put out an album of her own making and be actively involved in the producing and songwriting aspects of the album.  Still, given the lack of creativity or quality in the lyrical aspects of the song, I would think Christina would have done better to do what Whitney does...and let 'em pick the songs for you hun!  I think having a keen ear for great music is a far greater skill than being able to write lyrics because...anybody can write lyrics.<br />Still, I applaud Christina's desire to step away from the Britneys and Britney clones of the world (she is the only teeny-bopper who has exceptional talent).  Here she is writing about the plight of the \\"underappreciated\\" female and hopefully gaining the young-adult female demographic.  And us boys (some of us) dig this music too - at least some of it!<br />Unfortunately this album is too schizophrenia run wild.  It looks like Christina is trying to please her teen pop fans, adult contemporary fans, R&B fans, and gain a new audience - rock fans with the drafting of Linda Perry as a songwriter and collaborator.  While I love the idea that Christina wants to venture into rock, the music doesn't mold well in Stripped.<br />Christina Aguilera has the best singing voice of the teeny boppers that came out with the Britneys of the world.  Unfortunately, that is not enough to make your career \\"soar.\\"  She needs to learn to use her voice more as an instrument and that subtlety is an art form she must use in her music.  She doesn't have to belt out a ballad like she often does. She oversings and that's bad..very bad.<br />I think Stripped is a step in the right direction, though.  Christina needs to work with better songwriters and tone it down a bit.  And I still don't think she can sing a real ballad.  She up-tempos everything even the ballads.  Still, if you don't like Make Over...you will never like the direction Christina should go into.  That song rocks!  In that end maybe ballads isn't where Christina should be aiming for.  No matter what she does and even if it isn't superb music, I expect her to have a long career.<br />Buy Stripped if you bought Christina's debut.  Stripped shows her musical progression.  It's a better album!  Also buy this if you like most pop music.  Finally, buy this because a lot of the music here is not radio friendly and that's always a plus for a pop singer!  LOLdirection Christina should go into.  That song rocks!  In that end maybe ballads isn't where Christina should be aiming for.

B00004RFCM|4.0|There are few gifts that I can give my wife that will make her really happy. Jewelry and... well, this. Finally I have found something that is cheap that makes her happy. She had seen every one of these episodes on HBO..but being able to view everyone one of them was just the most amazing thing to her. She went back and forth to other episodes to see every detail of these shows. It was like watching guys check out cars.  Amazing stuff! And I even enjoy watching an episode once in a while, it's better than soap operas or lifetime tv...there is some nice scenery to keep men interested as well.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I had high hopes going into this record, for though I didn't like Zack DeLa Rocha, I dug what RATM was doing. I also like Cornell's Banshee wail vocals. Call it a guilty pleasure. So I just gave the record 2 full listens. It's good, but to me not much more than the sum of its parts. I went in expecting to hear Cornell singing to RATM, and that's what I got. Nothing has immediately leapt out at me as decidedly different in direction, and though it still rawks hard, it doesn't rawk new.<br />Definitely a good addition to the genre, and tho not a better &quot;fit&quot; with Cornell at the helm, it doesn't suffer from it either. I'm sure some stuff will grow on me with time, but I don't want to &quot;like&quot; it solely because I wish to. I want it to speak to me. <br />Euphoria Morning (Cornell's solo effort) spoke to me.
B0000039PW|5.0|If it wasn't for biggie we'd probably still be hearing all that g-funk. But luckily B.I.G came to the rescue and gave us the Greatest rap album of all time. Trust me I've heard all the other albums that people say are the greatest, but this is just the greatest.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Somewhere, George's spirit smiles on his son Dhani and friend Jeff Lynne for their handling of this final album.  George's voice is strong, his distinctive sound minimally produced, his themes topical and uncompromising.   It's the sound of a spiritually healthy and forward-facing man confronting the end of his (remarkable) physical life.  Bookended by the punchy  \\"Any Road\\" and the biting title song (which turns into a surprising and lovely Hindu chant performed by George and Dhani), the production is spare and crisp, allowing George's reedy voice, always unpolished and reassuring, to shine through.  Standout tracks are the chipper and ironic  \\"P2 Vatican Blues,\\" the serene instrumental  \\"Marwa Blues,\\" \\"Run So Far\\" (which Eric Clapton recorded on his Journeyman album), and the unutterably delightful ukelele-powered  \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,\\" a song that is impossible to listen to and not have your spirits lifted.  There's great evidence here of George's huge, underspoken influence in the Beatles' sound.   If you are not a Harrison fan this might not be the best intro to his work; All Things Must Pass is that.  Even if George had survived his cancer, this would be a remarkable statement; that it is his coda makes it more powerful and meaningful.  He left the world a far better place for his presence in it, and that's more than you can say about a lot of  what passes for music these days.

B0000039QA|5.0|Simply put. Biggie was just so good, especially at storytelling as he shows in \\"somebody's gotta die\\" \\"n*ggas bleed\\" and \\"i got a story to tell\\". He also has a nice tribute song to one of his friends on \\"miss u\\". Not many rappers can get hardcore then make a love song......... no more like a \\"play this while your girl's over your house song\\" ...
1573229725|5.0|Since John Fowles's THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMEN three decades ago many British novelists have tried to recapture the style and feel of the great pageturners from the novel's heyday, the Victorian era, often with mixed results. Sarah Waters, like Charles Palliser, has carved out a career for herself almost wholly in this subgenre, and succeeds even more brilliantly than Palliser. Her latest novel, FINGERSMITH, beautifully recaptures the can't-put-it-down excitement of her literary forerunner Wilkie Collins, and narrates the story of a group of thieves who engineer a cruel plot to commit an heiress to a madhouse with real aplomb and skill. But the novel is even better than that: it brings out into the open social and cultural concerns Collins or Dickens could not have spoken about quite so directly (particularly pornography and same-sex eroticism), and shows great insight into the metafictional issues involved in reworking this subgenre of the sensation novel. I recommend this extremely highly.

0385335482|3.0|Certainly entertaining, but why do all of these Bridget Jones read-alikes end up in television? At least one could have aspirations besides being a tan, thin, pretty talking head with a cute boyfriend.

B00005JKES|5.0|I was only ten when Twin Peaks was first aired on TV.  I watched it every week with my parents and my older brother and sister.  The show was so bizarre and twisted, and messed with my head so much, i had trouble sleeping for a few months.  But despite my sleeping troubles i still watched it because there was something about the series that fascinated me.  Needless to say, i was pretty much obsessed with it.  I happen to think that it was a brilliantly written show.  I would totally suggest buying the first season, because it's so interesting and so addicting it's hard to turn it off.  I haven't bought the dvd yet, but i've seen every episode, if you haven't seen every episode and you don't feel like getting up at 5am every morning to watch it on Bravo, i would recommend getting the dvd... it's way more interesting than you would expect.  (one suggestion, don't let your kids watch it... it's just a little too bizarre and twisted for most children)
B00006M183|5.0|As a hardcore Pearl Jam fan, many might say that any review I have is biased, but don't be fooled!  I'm so inspired by this album, I felt compelled to tell the world (a.k.a. everyone browsing this section of Amazon) about how this will be one of the best purchases of your life.  <BR>While I love every other Pearl Jam album, Riot Act is the only one without any weak tracks at all.  Even \\"Arc\\" which is basically just Ed chanting is really moving and magical and painfully honest.  And like classic Pearl Jam, the first couple of spins you aren't so sure about it, but by the 4th or 5th time you hear it, you are hooked.  I can't stop playing this CD.  Vedder's best lyrics to date--inspirational and hopeful and genuine.  So many of these tracks have had their turn once and again as my favorites...it's hard to pick just a few stand out tracks.  <BR>Just by reading any articles or interviews that have been floating around about the band and this album, it is obvious that the guys are really proud of the tunes...and once you give this CD a listen it's easy to hear why.  Pearl Jam is the best example of a band that has truly evolved and has only gotten better with time.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, Tool, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, among a few others are arguably the last honest-to-heart rock musicians to be in the mainstream.  A minute few survive to this day with the same impact and popularity as in their hey-day(if not more-so: Tool).  But after Zach de la Rocha relieved himself of vocal and lyrical duties in Rage Against the Machine and left, a door opened.  One which (now-defunct) Soundgarden frontman, Chris Cornell, would enter.  The musicians named their collaborative effort Civilian, recorded some demo's and an LP, only to break up due to artistic complications as well as contraversy relating to the album leaking to the internet.  After overcoming these obstacles the group re-united, renamed their outfit to Audioslave and wrote a new album.<br />This brings soulful old-fashioned rock back.  Reminiscent to Led Zeppelin, it re-affirms my belief that Chris Cornell is the most soulful rock singer there is in rock music today, and one of the most in rock history.  His vocals combine beautifully with Tom's rumbling, and grinding guitar riffs, and with Tim's utter bombast, as well as Brad's powerful and to-the-point drumming.  Listening to this music, I can't help but smile.  It's often driving and aggressive like any good hard rock or metal is, and other times subduing almost forcing us to raise lighters in the air and sway to the totally classic rock vibe.  It is, for the most part, powerful and emotional.<br />For a taste of the bombast of Rage + Cornell:  &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;<br />To sample the classic rock style: &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;

B00006IU73|5.0|....P>This is the kind of album I have waited for from a major music label for more than 20 years ever since Ambrosia's Road Island (ironic because Road Island is only available as an import!!!) In other words, this has been a long time coming and I am very excited about this major label release coming from such a quality rock band with its roots firmly planted in the past and yet planting completely new ones for the future of rock music. This album has everything I would look for in a rock album. Great riffs, singing, production, packaging, artwork. It is all here. ... And if in fact In Absentia does NOT make a big splash in the rock circles next year, there is indeed no chance of rock music to ever be considered worthwhile for me anymore. And that will be the day that I stop listening to what mainstream has to offer, not that they have released anything really good in a long time anyway.<br />Buy this album, and not a moment too soon. You will become a believer as well!!! This band is for real. Better yet, after you buy In Absentia go see Porcupine Tree live!!!
B00006LSM3|4.0|George Harrison has given us another gift. BRAINWASHED is many things, all of them good. I always thought he should have been labeled the 'humorous' Beatle instead of the 'quiet' Beatle. Many tongue-in-cheek lines as well as very thoughtful 'deep' ones make a George album something to listen to many times and enjoy thinking about what he is trying to tell us. Without mentioning any specific songs, George gives us all of his traits in this album. You laugh at his wit one moment then choke up a little when he jokes about his unfortunate situation. In other words, after 40 years the Beatles are still affecting us.
B00006M183|4.0|Wow what a weird album, I would say its very much ike a cross between yeild and Binaural.<BR>     Without a doubt the best song on here is &quot;get Right&quot;, Followed by &quot;I am mine&quot; and &quot;save you&quot;.<BR>    This album has weird ups and downs, unlike alot of their other stuff, and some songs you may find dont work one time you listen and then later they are great.<BR>    all in all its worth buying, unless all you want to listen to is &quot;ten&quot;.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Instead of the 'quiet' Beatle I always thought of George Harrison as the humorous yet thoughtful one. All of his marvelous traits are here on BRAINWASHED. Tongue-in-cheek wit one minute then a serious line that needs to be pondered for a time in order to understand, it's all here on this album. Rather than note any particular song I will just say that the entire thing is a joy to listen to. Working on these songs must have been therapeutic for him and now are ours to savor.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Okay I admit, when I first heard that Cornell was joining up with the remaining members of RATM, I was very doubtful and not very happy.  But I did rush out today and pick up the album, and it is incredible.  The new sound of Cornell on top of Morello's fantastic guitar playing is something that takes getting used to.  But once you're past the akwardness, it all sounds incredible.  This album is terrific.  For all of you with doubts, just give the album a listen, theres something in the CD for everyone.  I can't wait for them to become another legendary band that both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine was.  What a great debut album!
B00006X06U|5.0|It exceeds my wildest dreams -GORGEOUS. The music blows me away.<BR>It is at once, rapturously beautiful, emotionally staggering, and 100% Joni.<BR>I have listened to Travelogue about 10 times thus far and as with all of Joni's work repeated listening reveals layers. One thing that has jumped out at me is how Joni is painting on a huge canvas with lots of colors. To me it is the prime example of Joni's painting with words and music concept.<BR>Sometimes its a short phrase. Examples:<BR>Otis & Marlena \\"Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs\\" the strings sound like shuffling slippers.<BR>Sire Of Sorrow \\"You're stumbling in shadows\\" there is a quick, jagged piano chord stumbling.<BR>Other times it is the entire arrangement. Woodstock is transformed into a dirge. The Last Time I Saw Richard becomes tongue in cheek. Cherokee Louise aches with longing for the lost friend.<BR>I think this is the music Joni has always heard in her head and it must have been a powerful and liberating experience for her.<BR>This is a major work.
B000002H6C|5.0|Most of the songs on here are far beyond awesome, although after this album i have to say nothing else was put out close to Metallica's first 4 original recordings. TO LOVE IS TO DIE, the best song i have ever heard. C'mon guys, the beautiful excellent riffs, and the lyrics written by cliff in the middle, this song is the best. Even if it were just because of this one song, i would by the CD. i Recommend this CD!
B00006YXEK|5.0|I had to have this disc being a George Harrison fan from the Beatle days of the sixties all through his solo career. You can always tell when George Harrison's guitar is playing. It has that special sound only he can produce. The songs here are magnificent - some spiritual - some fun.  I listened to it all day today in a joyful yet sad way. I bought the DVD special edition for 18.88 at Best Buy. It has a poster, a guitar pick with his signature embossed on it, a Dark Horse sticker and a 7 minute DVD of info, interviews and philosophy from George, his son Dhani who talks much like George, Jeff Lynne and others. I love it. Thanks George!
B00005JKZ3|1.0|No plot line, stale jokes, and 2 unenthusiastic, overpaid actors adds up to one stinker of a movie!!!  <br />I went to see it in the theater and asked for my money back!
B00006YXEK|5.0|I had to have this disc being a George Harrison fan from the Beatle days of the sixties all through his solo career. You can always tell when George Harrison's guitar is playing. It has that special sound only he can produce. The songs here are magnificent - some spiritual - some fun.  I listened to it all day today in a joyful yet sad way. I bought the DVD special edition for 18.88 at Best Buy. It has a poster, a guitar pick with his signature embossed on it, a Dark Horse sticker and a 7 minute DVD of info, interviews and philosophy from George, his son Dhani who talks much like George, Jeff Lynne and others. I love it. Thanks George!
B00006RU5B|5.0|The album of the year enough said.
0684833395|1.0|I forced myself through one hundred pages of this book and then I stopped. Nothing much was happening &amp; I just had no interest in the characters or slow moving story line. Maybe the book picks up further a long, but I wasn't interested enough to read on. Maybe I missed something as the reviews for this book are most high.
0345413377|4.0|I enjoyed this series.  The characters where rich, the Paradise Lost plot parallels were challenging even for an adult (though maybe I was trying to read too much into it), and the ending was great!  Lyra, who many feel became Will's sidekick in book 2, is back at the forefront of action (as it should be!).  This novel is full of adventure, twists, and surprizes.  The ending is heart wrenching and left me quite sad that I was leaving Lyra and Will.
B000001EMW|5.0|I was completely dumbfounded when a fellow heavy metal lover friend of mine told me about this group. They did what? I love Metallica dearly and was more than a little apprehensive about this CD. When he said \\"cellos,\\" my reaction was, \\"oh, those funny looking violins that you put between your legs, right?\\" I have a new appreciation for the cello when it was used as a metal instrument. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is my favorite Metallica song, and I love it even more after hearing the Apocalyptica version. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was chilling, and \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\" made me cheer. Even classical players ought to enjoy this CD, especially if you play those funny-looking violin things...
0451528018|4.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles must be one of the greatest classic mysteries.  While I find Holmes to be somewhat pretentious and priggish, his mind is amazing.  The characterization of the moor is beautiful (yes, I think the moor is a character in this novel!).  The story is thrilling and challenging for younger readers.  A great novel to teach students about setting as a character.
B000001EMW|5.0|And here we are back at the very basis of Apocalyptica's music, the hard-core, plain and simple, no-distortions-added-and-no-bass-or-percussion-either CD. And I still love it. Metallica is not my favorite group, (sorry Metalli fans) but that doesn't stop me from loving these cover songs even more. Take the time to listen-really listen-to \\"The Unforgiven\\" or the powerful \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and you'll find the very basis of beautiful music. That's right, I said beautiful-in reference to a heavy metal group. I encourage anyone who enjoys the power of string music, classical fans like myself, or Metalli fans. There's nothing that distorts what Metallica created originally, and without vocals, you're able to focus more on what is so often ignored otherwise-the chords and combinations of sound. It's breathtaking.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Without a doubt the best Star trek series. Even better than the original sreies. Just because of the topics it coverd politics,war,religon and other stuff the other sreies were afraid to cover. It isn't Roddenberry's vision it is better. The best nothing else has to be said.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Not only one of the best comedies ever made.  This is one of the most heartwarming movies ever made.  Bill Murray gives his best performance in this movie.  When you watch this, it makes you want Bill to come out with another movie, he's a very unnapreciated actor.  Very talented.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was very apprehensive about this line-up when it was first announced.  I didn't think there was any way that Rage's sound could be combined with Cornell's vocals.  It just wasn't a mix that I would have imagined.  Upon first listen to this CD ... it is excellent!  Much better than I expected.  Don't get me wrong I thought the original Rage line-up with Zach was great, but Cornell is a much better vocalist.  In my opinion he was the best vocalist to emerge from the Seattle grunge scene of the early 90's.  Audioslave is much more diverse musically with the combination of Morello's distinctive guitar sound and Cornell's wailing vocals.  There are tracks that will appeal to both Rage fans and Soundgarden fans alike.  I would highly recommend this CD!
0800179501|1.0|I see all of these reviews giving this DVD 5 stars and I have to laugh.  No widescreen, sub-standard pan-and-scan print, lack of any quality extras (and this was a 2nd release of this film!) sounds like a VHS review---perhaps these reviews are for that.  DVD means widescreen---period!  With the exception of the older movies that were filmed in fullscreen (i.e. \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"On The Water Front\\" -- two well-made DVDs btw) no movie, not a one, should be released if there isn't a widescreen version on it---certainly a movie shouldn't ever be released TWICE with both versions fullscreen....  Rumor has it that they have been unable to find a useable widescreen version of this film (hard to believe isn't it?) to use for a DVD, but in that case be  up front about it and quit releasing this POS version on DVD---do it a third time and heads will roll.

1559408855|5.0|This very disturbing, controversial Italian film, brings the viewer to another demension of life all together.  The decadance of society and the struggle to have power over others, particularly sexually.<BR>Loads of nude young people...being tortured, whipped, forced to have intercourse with old men, the list goes on and on.  If you are looking to be amazed and shocked...this film may just do the trick.<BR>Not your average film about times during World War II.  It has nothing to do with Facism or Nazi's in Italy during the war.  It has everything to do with perversion, sadistic behavior, sexual gratification and voyerism.  Sit back with the lights dimmed and let yourself into the perverted world of Pasolini....
0618077367|5.0|This is a lovely story. Both the writing and the illustrations are superior. This is one of those books that is definitely worth owning, and in a hardcover version, not a paperback that will wear and tear. Parents: it is a keeper, one that you will save for years and to read to your future grandchildren.<br />The story is of a boy's journey on a mysterious train, the Polar Express, that takes children (adorned in their pajamas) to the North Pole to Santa's village. I won't spoil the story by telling any more...<br />There are loads of Christmas themed children's books out there for this age range. Many are mediocre or just plain garbage. This book is in the superior category and a \\"must own\\".<br />Knowing nothing about this story, both my son and I were drawn to it because of his love of trains. If you don't know the story, just be aware it introduces the idea that not all people believe in Santa Claus. This was the first time my (then) three-year-old learned that not everyone believes, whether they are adults or children. It also explains that as some people grow older they change from a believer to a non-believer. Just know that before reading the story to your child. For us it introduced the idea of non-believing. Another family I know read the book after an older child told this young child there is no Santa Claus, and the book helped deal with the issue of when some believe and some don't believe.<br />The gift pack we purchased had the audio version on CD. Narrator-actor William Hurt's voice is wonderful, slow and flowing...just right to evoke the mood of the story! There is also a CD-ROM for the computer (sold separately), which is a read-aloud story with images that my children watch a handful of times per Christmas season.<br />The gift pack also comes with a Christmas tree ornament. My children are thrilled to have a Polar Express related ornament to adorn our Christmas tree because they love trains and they love this story.
B00006LSM3|4.0|George Harrison...whew, what can you say? John Lennon has become as close to a modern-day religious icon as they come. But while John sang of love and peace, George went much deeper than that and took the journey inward to true spiritual enlightenment. You have only to listen to \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Concert for Bangla Desh\\" to know that he had a higher understanding and appreciation of the ephemeralness of it all. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by the whole \\"Why are we here and what does it all mean? conundrum, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" offers as much understanding of that eternal mystery as is humanly possible (that, and Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" and Joyce's \\"The Dead\\"). As for \\"Brainwashed,\\" if you can get past the first two tracks, you will find music here that at times measures up to and is every bit as sublime as George's best work. A beautiful parting gift from \\"the quiet one.\\"
B00006RU5B|5.0|Its been a long time since i reviewed any thing here at Amazon.com. Looking back at some of my reviews i'm quite embarased of the stuff i was listing too. Well this is defnitly not one of those albums one can look back on with regret. AUDIOSLAVE for those not in the know is the combo of Chris Cornell, formaly of Soundgarden (Vocals) with the 3 remaning members of Rage Against the Machine.<br /> There self titled debut so a rock expolosion! It rasises the question, Why did we have to wait so long to hear the ever so powerful voice of Chris Cornell. But he in not the only one who's proformance is noteworthy. Infact, I think this is Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk at their best. It had to be quite the adjustment going from a someone of such a rythmeic vocal style (Zach) to the more melodic aproch of chris cornell.<br />  Its my personal opinion that this band could be the Led Zeppelin of this generation. and on such songs as the current single Cochise, Shaddow on the Sun, Gasoline and Exploder, they prove that with a very sophisticated intencity. There is also plenty of melody, as demonstrated from songs such as, I am a Highway, Getaway Car and Like a Stone. there isn't a bad song on the entire album and I would defnitly say this may just be the most anticipated album of the year. You will not regret purchasing this album. If you were a fan of either of the bands the members used to be associated with or not.

B00005RY7X|5.0|When you bring up Andrew WK here in NYC your bound to get one of a few different responces. \\"All his songs sound the same\\", \\"What stupid music\\" or \\"He is an unsung genius\\". I happen to be a subscriber to the third belief.<br /> Andrew WK was an overnight obsession for me. I read about him on a message board one night and from the way they were talking i was expecting a snobby new pop star. for a week or so i was confused as to who this Andrew WK person was. My cureosity was confused on a saturday night, when he was the musical guest on SNL. I was so over joyed and taken in by the music and performance i was wittnesing! Here is a big, muscular guy who looks like an excaped mental patient, crossed with a wrestler and hes singing about party, and slam dancing and jumping. He had a smile that NEVER seemed to leave his face. Needless to say, the next day I went out and purchased I Get Wet.<br /> This album is how  I would picture fun to sound like. Its catchy, and addictive pop hooks, mixed with a touch of hair metal, classic rock, and death metal. Andrew him self describes his genera of Ultraisim.<br /> People may believe he is a one trick pony, but there is deepness in these lyrics. Andrew WK speaks of life as one big party, and you have to get the most out of it, and have the most fun doing it as possible. This comes through loud and clear on one of my favorite songs on the album, Gota Do It. In a song that at site of the title you'd think was about sex, Andrew convays messages of never backing down, and refusing to stop doing what you love to do.<br /> I met Andrew WK for the first time this past October after a concert at Irving Plaze. He hung out with me and my friends for at least an hour, and we talked of music,life,insperation, drugs,beer, and other such things. I told him what the song, Gota Do It ment to me, and how I wish he'd played it that night. He said he'd remember that and the next time he was in NY He'd play it for me. There is no nicer or more tolerent artist then Andrew WK. He had hugs for all, and wrote passages on anything anyone asked him to sign.<br /> After meeting Andrew, I've only become a bigger fan, and I think he could make anyone in to a fan at a meeting. Give I Get Wet a chance, with a clear open mind, and you may like it! Hell, you may even Smile! Now i will end this review in true ultraisim fashion, with a big.. PARTY HARD!st then Andrew WK.

0930289331|5.0|Frank Miller will always be best known for The Dark Knight Returns, and many people (myself included) regard Batman: The Killing Joke to be the greatest single Batman story ever. But this is a very close second. <BR>The story begins with recent Gotham City Police Department hiree Jim Gordon arriving for the first time in Gotham. Coincidentally, it is the day that 25 year old multimillionaire Bruce Wayne returns to his hometown after many years of mysterious travel abroad. The story takes us through a year to see how Gordon reacts to corruption and graft in the Police Force, and how Bruce Wayne will become the Batman. It is also told through Gordon's and Wayne's point of view, which was a nice touch. It climaxes when Police Commissioner Loeb orders Batman to be taken down, with a really spectacular ending. <BR>David Mazuchelli's artwork is dynamic and gritty. He draws the Dark Knight and his world beautifully. Frank Miller's words are simply marvelous. I was captured from the first page, and didn't put it down until I had read it.<BR>Overall, this is a great place to start if you're looking to become a Batman fan. The story isn't complicated, but is still riveting. If you don't read this, you're missing out on some of the best comics literature there has ever been. I can't recommend this book enough.
6301942647|5.0|This can be easily THE most beautiful movie I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot), and it's just driving me crazy not having it on DVD, it's insane. Few movies get to touch me so deeply, particularly after all the s**t that comes out of hollywood... thanfully, this is really different. This is the most poetic movie I've ever seen and I can't help to recommend it to everyone, I know not all will like it (because it is unlike anything you've seen) but for those who do, they'll be marked. It is so beautiful, so touching, so deep, so poetic. Unbelievable. Kurosawa is THE genius. Never had I fallen in such deep a trance as in this movie. It absorbs you into a floating state of thought, it embraces you into becoming part of it. I felt the happiness, I felt the cold, I felt the silence. I felt it all. And never had I felt in such a delicate way with a movie. If you can't buy it, rent it, if you can't do that, get it ANYway you can. Believe me, it won't be an opportunity lost.
B00006LSM3|4.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is the last studio recording by the late, great George Harrison, the so-called \\"quiet Beatle\\".  As such, it will always have a certain signifigance in his canon.  However, compared with his two finest (it says here) solo efforts, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Cloud Nine\\", it falls a little short.  For one, both of those albums featured a star-studded cast of supporting musicians (i.e., Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Dave Mason, Elton John, Eric Clapton), which gave more variety to the songs.<BR>In \\"Brainwashed\\", the cast is rather insular, albeit close to George's heart:  his son, Dhani, ex-ELO and Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne and top-notch session drummer (and long-time Harrison friend) Jim Keltner.  The production, thankfully, is devoid of the ELO-inflected sounds and whoops that defined \\"Cloud Nine\\", and for good reason.  Harrison left explicit instrucions to his son and Lynne on how he wanted the songs finished and, it would seem, they honored those requsts.  The songs themselves are pure George:  plenty of slide-guitar backed by driving acoustic guitars, occasional ukelele and tongue-in-cheek lyrics spinkled throughout.  From the first song, \\"Any Road\\", which starts with Harrison commanding, \\"Gimme plenty of that guitar\\", the album reflects all that one has come to expect from \\"Dark Horse\\".  It is revealing, given all that Harrison was facing in his last days, how uplifting the feel of this album is.  After all, he has long resigned himself to the believe that he was only in this \\"material world\\" for but a brief time.  The opening song has a humorous Yogi Berra-like line, \\"if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there\\".  Among the other cuts, \\"Rising Sun\\" is reminiscent of any number of songs from \\"All Things Must Pass\\", yet with a hint that he is about to become one of those things that will be passing.  He also \\"covers\\" a song he wrote for Eric Clapton's \\"Journeyman\\", \\"(Can Only) Run So Far\\"; \\"Marwa Blues\\" is a \\"Wonderwall\\"-like instrumental and he even pulls out an old chestnut from way-back-when, \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\".  The album, which from beginning-to-end is done in a tidy 46:27, concludes with the title cut that is, perhaps, one of the lesser efforts and finishes with Harrison reciting an Indian chant.  Overall, I rate this as a four-star effort;  three stars for the album itself and another star for completing this with such a strong and optimistic outlook as he was \\"heading for the light\\".
B00006YXEK|5.0|If you like the Traveling Wilbury's/ Beatles with a touch of ELO you will love this. Great production from the sixth Beatle Jeff Lynne and wonderful guitar and singing from George. If you enjoyed Cloud Nine it really is a continuation of that album, maybe it should have been titled Cloud Nine Part 2. We are very fortunate to receive this album and as Jeff Lynne stated there are apparently enough songs in the can for a couple more albums.<BR>So please Jeff roll them out asap.<BR>Buy it it's a classic
B00006RU5B|5.0|Best Hardrock CD this year - Period.
B0000009UX|4.0|Listen to the opening lines of \\"The Loved Ones\\" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano \\"noodling\\" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM.
0812548094|4.0|In this book, the author expands on his main characters, Richard and Kahlan, plus brings new and interesing characters into the fold. 'Stone of Tears' is more engaging than 'First Rule.'<BR>This is a fantasy series that I have wholeheartedly embraced. So far, each of the two books are self-contained. Mr. Goodkind &quot;finishes&quot; each story without the cliffhanger ending, so you can enjoy each book on it's own merit. I eagerly anticipate the third book, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; and each book thereafter. If they are like the first two, and I believe they are even better, then this is a series I won't stop reading until I've read all the books back-to-back.<BR>Excellent. Outstanding read!

B00006M183|4.0|Let me start by saying that, although not completely dissatisfied with Binaural, I knew it was not a full-on effort by everyone in Pearl Jam. I thought Matt Cameron and his skills were used poorly, and the music was fine but nothing that this band is fully capable of. Switch gears to the great new album, \\"Riot Act\\", and you see more of what this great band is able to do when they gel and get excited about making music. The guitars sound rawer, the drumming is powerful, and the songs range from exciting to adequate. Eddie Vedder seems a little restrained at times, but sometimes we are quick to forget that he is not necesarily angry anymore. Maybe just miffed at the situations in this world. Needless to say, his voice still speaks volumes, and is still much more engrossing than the Scott Stapps and Chad Kroegers and Aaron Lewises that currently occupy the rock landscape. At times, this album also seems like an answer album, kind of a medium ground between \\"we are keeping the respectability path we have been taking all along\\" and \\"we still want you to like us.\\" Whether Pearl Jam is more concerned with grabbing new fans than satisfying the ones that stuck around after \\"Vitalogy\\" is a question that remains to be answered. As a long-time fan, I am wholly satisfied with this effort. It does jump a bit from style to style, but so do a lot of great albums. Some of Pearl Jam's best and most compelling work is on this set, including the rocking \\"Save You\\" and \\"Get Right\\", the poignant \\"Love Boat Captain\\" (i do have to question the odd title of this one) and \\"Thumbing My Way\\", and the mid-tempo greats \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Can't Keep\\". \\"Cropduster\\" jumped out at me with its strong chorus and ample guitar workings from Mike McCready (who shows up a lot on this album in solo form and rarely disappoints...his most since vs.). The album slows its momentum after the fast \\"Green Disease\\", and this may lose some people, but stick around for what I think is one of Pearl Jam's most atmospheric songs, \\"All or None.\\" Simple in structure and lyricism, it nonetheless ends the album on a strong note, especially with McCready's solo fading. Their best closer since \\"Indifference.\\" This may not still be what Pearl Jam is fully capable of. Like Stephen King was always the late 20th century's answer to \\"who has the greatest shot of writing the Great American Novel,\\" Pearl Jam has always been eyed as the most likely candidate to lay down a mid-career \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Physical Graffiti\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\". Perhaps not this time, but, boy, they're getting close.
B00006RU5B|5.0|You can't go wrong with Chris Cornell.  Whether he's by himself or in a band, he's brilliant.  It sure helps when the band he's with features Wilk, Commerford, and Tom Morello, one of the most imaginative guitarists around today.  There were several times during this album when I wondered how the hell Morello crafted some of those sounds out of just a guitar, kind of like what Jimi Hendrix did, as far as pushing the capabilities of the guitar.  To compliment his experimentation are his funky riffs and fluid hooks.  He really is brilliant, and Commerford and Wilk provide one of the most muscular backbones in rock.  This alubm really doesn't sound like a debut, but I can't wait for the next one, because if this is the beginning, it's almost scary to think of how this band could grow and evolve together.  With such a powerful sound, these guys are going to be a completely rocking live band.
B00006LSM3|5.0|As any pop fan knows George started his post Beatle career with a masterpiece (All Things Must Pass) that many critics felt he never equaled. I for one would have added his \\"comeback\\" album Cloud Nine to that assessment and I have always felt the albums called George Harrison and 33 1/3 were two very strong records and the rest of Harrison's output was always a listenable and professional effort. No huge clunkers like Sometime in New York or Wings Wildlife - but we won't get into that.<BR>I must admit to being nervous on first listening to this, not knowing how I would feel reacting to hearing the first new Harrison album in fifteen years - knowing that it is also the last. But the album on first listening was fine. Yes it has flaws, Harrison was as sanctimonious as ever and his faith he wears on his sleeve, but so what. If you want something characterless and safe there is plenty out there to chose from. This album is a personal and final statement from one of the legends of pop/rock or as he would have preferred leg ends. Prior to his death George had joked he was going to call this CD Portrait of a Leg End.<BR>If you are a fan of Harrison's signature slide guitar playing there is plenty of it on this album including a beautiful instrumental called Marwa Blues. Any Road starts off the CD with a Wilbury-like workout and continues with P2 Vatican Blues. There are many wonderful melodic ideas and his George Formby rendition complete with ukulele of Harold Arlen's Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea is a nice light touch before Harrison's scathing title song Brainwashed but even Brainwashed has its humorous touches and ends with a prayerful Indian chant with his son Dhani.<BR>This album will grow on you with repeated listenings. It may not be a masterpiece but it fits snugly alongside 33 1/3 and George Harrison as very good work and radiates with a character and depth one is hard pressed to find in today's' pop.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I love the Soft Bulletin and In a Priest Driven Ambulance and<BR>I love this album. Buy this album and if you have a chance <BR>go see them live as well, then gosh darnit do it.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Amazing, that's all I can say.
B0000046KM|5.0|I was given a promo copy of this cd back a few years.  Was mesmerized by it then.  Recently, while listening to Diana Krall, I went looking for my Shirley Horn cd.  Have taken Here's to Life out of storage, truly timeless, a classic treasure for your music collection.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I've always admired Beck and his seemingly bottomless cupful of talent. I didn't think I could be so impressed by the quality of his work (already expecting the best), but \\"Sea Change\\" exceeds my expectations. I'll admit that it takes a few listens to get past the initial impression of the music being a bit dull and downbeat. However, upon the 4th or 5th listen, you will begin to appreciate the richly textured music and purely delivered lyrics and you won't be able to stop listening to the disc. The mood of the disc isn't so much melancholy, as some have suggested, but thoughful and sober. It's a complete departure from the fun of \\"Midnite Vultures\\" and \\"Odelay\\" and a few steps further in the same direction of \\"Mutations\\". In any case, it's a fantastic disc from a man who has more talent than one man should fairly possess.
B00006YXEK|5.0|This last testament of George is spectacular.  Every cut is a gem filled with the Harrison wit and insight.  He has been a big part of my life and I am thankful to God that I was alive at the same time he was.  This album is filled with energy and life, much more than you would perhaps think.  George is not bemoaning the facts of life, other than our stupidity as humans-and even that is done with humor.  George touches us in ways no one else can.  If he was indeed the Quiet Beatle, then he listened and learned well.  I must confess I started as a John fan, but found I could only listen to some of his music-the same with Paul. But George was the muse of my soul. Thank you George, Jeff, and Dhani.  May God bless you all for the love you have made.
B00006NSGX|4.0|This CD just goes to show that Clapton plays his best shows in MSG (this cd was recorded from LA and Tokoyo). Clapton is my favorite of all time, its just that this album doesnt seem that well organized with the style and sequence of the songs. This is a good cd with some great live preformances, particularly &quot;Badge&quot; and &quot;River of Tears&quot; one of my new favorites. Bottom line, this is a good album, that you should definately go out and buy, it just could have been more.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Although it doesn't have the scope or depth of Harrison's solo debut (All Things Must Pass although technically speaking Wonderwall was his first solo album), Brainwashed is one of the best solo albums Harrison made. The sad part is that he'll never be able to follow up on this terrific album. None of this is being said after looking through rose tinted glasses; the songs on Brainwashed are among his most accomplished and lyrically adept since ATMP, Living in the Material World and Cloud Nine).<br />Although finished by Jeff Lynne in collaboration with Dhani Harrison (they both added additional touches such as rhythm guitar overdubs, strings whether appropriate and backing vocals on some of the uncompleted tracks), Harrison's distinctive slide guitar playing and singing are never buried or obscured. Lynne and Dhani Harrison have lovingly applied their musical craft to finish this terrific album in a style that Harrison would have approved of (although Lynne does mention in the DVD included that Harrison might have thought the production touches a little too much and apologies by saying, \\"sorry George but they were such beautiful songs\\". They still are and, I don't doubt, that Harrison would have approved).<br />It's as he never quit recording. Brainwashed sounds like the logical successor to Cloud Nine and the Wilbury albums. Harrison, Lynne and Dhani Harrison build an accomplished and tuneful musical ladder that allows George to climb to the top. When he gets up there he lets his playing speak for itself. Brainwashed features some of George's most affecting and powerful playing.<br />The opening track Any Road, Vatican Blues and Stuck Inside a Cloud (a personal fav of Dhani's, it's track number 7 as 7 was George's favorite number)are all outstanding. Harrison's collaboration with Jools Holland and his band on the standard Devil and the Deep Blue Sea isn't camped up. Harrison plays \\"uke\\" (as he and Dhani call it). Holland and his band give a nice swing texture to the track.<br />The magnum opus, though, is the title track. Brainwashed manages to roll all of Harrison's favorite topics into one. The use of sitar and other Indian musical textures both look back to Pepper and acknowledge that Harrison's affection for Ravi Shankar and Indian music was never a fad for George. It's a powerful 6 minute piece and still manages to end the album on a positive note.<br />George's tasteful slide playing is all over the album and reminds me what an accomplished and talented player he was. He may never of had the chops of Hendrix but then he didn't need them. His lyrical and melodic playing always was a highlight of his solo work.<br />The DVD in the deluxe backage is a short documentary on the making of the album. It includes glimpses of the recording of the album both when Harrison was recording and Lynne & Dhani were finishing it. There's a number of brief interviews of George situationed throughout the video. We also get to see a music video that George recorded with Jools Holland and his band for the song Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. Additionally, there's clips for Any Road and Stuck Inside a Cloud that uses footage of George on his estate.<br />The big question will be is the DVD and extras worth it? Certainly if you're a big Beatles or Harrison fan. I wish the DVD could have been longer and included any number of the videos being created for the album. The sticker, poster and guitar pick are nice additions.<br />Given a few more listens, I might change that 4 1/2 star review to a five!e track.<br />The magnum opus, though, is the title track.

B000002LGQ|3.0|Many fans consider this one of Madonna's best.<BR>Sorry guys, i just can't bring myself to like it at all...<BR>the only 3 tracks i think to be worth on this CD are PROMISE TO TRY (now that's a praying-related lyrics, definitely not LIKE A PRAYER or PRAY FOR SPANISH EYES...), CHERISH (which is in my opinion the only tune that holds on to her original pop hits)and KEEP IT TOGETHER (just perfect for the dancefloor, autobiographical to the point and radio friendly).<BR>EXPRESS YOURSELF and OH FATHER are not the masterpieces some people brag about, the duet with Prince is something that feels as if born out of pure commercial marketing, and the rest...well, lukewarm to say the least.<BR>She is an everchanging artist, you are right. And the album is nevertheless better than the average productions.<BR>But this album sounds very fake to me...
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is a collection of beautifully written and performed songs, that make me want to play them over and over again. I don't think I have ever heard George play such wonderful slide, and there have been alot of really sweet solos from him over the years. Every track is great in its own way, while still feeling like totally timeless George. Could be 1973, could be 1986, but it's not the fad of the day. Not as &quot;ELO'd&quot; as Cloud Nine, Jeff and Dhani tread lightly here. Thanks to them for such a fine job finishing, and thanks for sharing this with the world. I hope this CD gets the recognition it deserves in its own right, not just as a curiosity. Buy this, enjoy it, spread the word.<br />I hate digipacks though, I bought both versions, and they will both end up getting worn and scuffed, it would have been nice having the standard issue in a jewel box...
B00006LSM3|5.0|won't say much except this is a keeper.<BR>if you're a beatle fan, its essential..if not still good way to get turned onto the genius and easygoing sound of the quiet beatle (and you gotta add 'all things must pass' to your collection as well.<BR>it's all really well done, a mixed bag of rockers and his eastern sound on a few. very tight and he sounds great.<BR>sorta travelling wilburyish, but vintage harrison as well.<BR>you could imagine the other 3 easily fitting into any of the songs. track 3, looking for my life and tracks 8, never get over you..and  track 10 looking for my rocking chair are standouts.<BR>to think most if it was done as he was very ill, with not a trace of sadness or morbidunity..a really nice ending for the guy.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell is still the consumate vocalist, lyricist and poet in music today. For any fan of Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog or Chris Cornell himself, this is a must have. Tom Morello on guitar is a great compliment to his awesome talent. To say this album rocks, is an understatement<br />If you apprceiate what genuine and inspired music really is, you must own Audioslave. This is a great revelation in a time when music is gasping its last breath.<br />My faith has been renewed.<br />Thank God for Chris Cornell.
B00005K1ZH|1.0|YES......<br />THESE REPLICAS ARE ALMOST INCREDIBLE... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... THE PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT, BUT.....WELL, MY FRAGILE COPY HAS A TERRIBLE ONE CHANNEL MINI DROPOUT IN ROUNDABOUT, ON THE VERY BEGGINING,.  THIS IS UNADMISSIBLE FOR A YES FAN THAT PAYS 30 DOLLARS FOR A CD!<br />MY GOING FOR THE ONE DOES TOO, SO MY CLOSE TO THE EDGE REPLICAS.  I HAVE CHEKED OUT AND THIS DROPOUTS ARE ALL OVER SEVERAL OF THESE MINIATURES.<br />LITTLE DROPOUTS, BUT FOR THIS PRICE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT ! I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS STUFF !  YOU BETTER GET THE OLD REMASTERS OR WAIT FOR RHINO<br /> YES RE-RELEASES. I HAVE HEARD ROUNDABOUT ON YES' NEW BOX SET AND SOUNDS GREAT, WITHOUT THE DISSAPOINTING SOUND DROPOUTS.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This cd is a nice bookend to George's music library. His voice sounds great and the slide playing is tops.The production is mainly  light , with a few exceptions , where strings are added.I would rate this in his top 3 studio albums along with ATMP and Cloud Nine.There are influences of Indian music and lots of bluesy stuff too.I didn't think Beatles when I heard it , just classic Harrison. Dhani and Jeff Lynne did a nice job wrapping it up for George. It is just sad that it will be the last ever , all new cd from George.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is proof that it is still possible to make amazing music. The unmatched originality of the three remaining members of Rage is recreated in an environment that departs from their rap/rock past as Cornell hammers each song with his infamous voice. This album should prove to be an appropriate begining to a band that rocks and will continue to do so.
B00006V9A0|4.0|even though it only has one song to offer long time fans (you know youre right) and even though honestly it isnt that great of a song, this is still a great collection.  i am 16, and nirvana was way before my time in music.  I was only 8 years old when he took his life.  But now the next generation can now appreciate what Nirvana brought to the table, and if you are a casual/neutral fan like me, it is the perfect definitive collection of all their hits packed into one CD.  It goes in chronological order- from their 1989 indie debut, Bleach, all the way up to their last album, MTV Unplugged.  The only complaint i have is that there are only 14 tracks and the booklet and overall artwork deserved a little more attention.  We are talking about one of the most groundbreaking, influential bands in history.  They could have at least put some more pictures or something, because it is all slapped together.  But other than that, this is great in time for the holidays.
B00006IR5S|5.0|As a long time fan of both John Williams and Harry Potter, you can imagine how much I was looking forward to this soundtrack.  When I first heard &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix,&quot;  I was absolutely blown away!  I couldn't believe that John Williams had actually outdone himself!  A lot of John's wonderful music from the first film is reborn along with new material.  Also, if you listen hard enough, you can hear some of his other great scores sneaking in and out of the new stuff.  This CD is awesome!  Go buy it!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. The pain and anguish of lost love is seeping out of Amanda's Root's performance. She has a misarable family, who are only concerned with social rank, hair styles and fashion, and that's just her Dad!  One sister pretends to be sick when she's bored with her children and husband, but still manages to eat like there's no tomorrow! Her other sister is more concerned with the latest in marzipan, than she is in anything else.<br />There's other stuff going on, intrigue, romance and the beautiful English countryside. The characters spring from Austen's book and if you like Jane Austen, you'll certainly appreciate this British version of Persuasion.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This Spiderman DVD was definitely worth the purchase.  The movie is definitely awesome.  SPiderman has long been my favorite superhero, and this movie does good justice to the comic book.<br />At first, I was skeptical to having Tobey Maguire play Peter Parker(Spiderman).  But after seeing the film, I have a little more respect for him, and comparing him to the comic photo shootin' action hero, I could definitely see the resemblance.  And on a side note, Mr. Jameson was ON PAR! <br />As far as extra features, this DVD is packed.  I especially liked the part where you could go to short clips on the making of the movie, while the movie was playing.  The features are good and overall I think this is worth the time and money.
B00005MP58|5.0|I adore Jane Austen's writing. This version is really fantastic. I've read this book several times and this adaptation is very true to the written word. The costumes, scenery, all come to life in this classic tale of misunderstanding and finally, ture love triumphing over all.<br />Elizabeth's likable character is brought to life, as are all of Austen's wonderful characters, all with their own particular foibles.<br />Some of my particular favorites are the Bennett's clerical cousin, an odd-looking fellow, who, in his spare time, composes those little compliments that ladies so love to hear, the Bingly sisters, the eldest, whose angular features are almost as sharp as her tounge, Mrs. Bennett, who is comically annoying and there are many more who make this an engaging telling of Jane Austen's story.<br />I guess I can't overlook Mr. Darcy, played by Colin Firth, who while not my particular cup of tea, does such an excellent job playing the details of Mr. Darcy's pent up feelings of love for Elizabeth and his sheer and utter discomfort during disquieting social situations.<br />Set in the English country side, you'll want to brew a pot of tea for this movie. Turn off the phone and escape to the gentile world of English society.
0375704027|2.0|Haruki Murakami seemed to have little faith in his reader¡¦s ability to get his point¡XHe practically left nothing to the reader¡¦s imagination. Reading this book gives you the feeling that you were constantly hit on the head by a hammer.<br />In short, he tried too hard to make himself understood. In an exchange among Naoko, Reiko, and Toru in the first meeting at the sanatorium, Reiko said, ¡§If you feel like raping anybody in the middle of the night, don¡¦t get the wrong one. The unwrinkled body in the left bed is Naoko¡¦s.¡¨ Then Naoko responded, ¡§Liar. Mine is the right bed.¡¨ A more skilful writer would have done more scene setting to convey what went through the characters¡¦ minds, instead of relying on one character to point out that the other character lied.<br />Murakami also seemed to be too eager to see the reader compare his book to ¡§A Catcher in the Rye¡¨ and ¡§The Great Gatsby.¡¨ A confident writer would have been more subtle, letting his reader discover the similarity through writing style.<br />The conversations throughout the book were neither witty nor romantic. When Murakami tried too hard, the conversations turned contrived or childish, as shown in so many conversations that centered around bodily fluids and women¡¦s underwear. Midori¡¦s dirty talk probably appealed to young adolescent boys, and I emphasize ¡§young,¡¨ because some of the supposedly funny dialogues about bodily functions could bore even people in their late teens.<br />My other complaint was that the author got carried away when it came to sex scenes.  It¡¦s not clear to me what the intention was behind the overly explicit descriptions. Was the author more interested in exciting the senses? Among the numerous sex scenes, the one involving an adult and a child was the most off-putting.<br />The characters in general didn¡¦t evoke sympathy. Instead, they came across as crybabies. Midori¡¦s complaints about her parents not loving her enoughwere laughable.<BR> <BR>In other coming-of-age stories that revolve around love and lust, after all was said and done, the characters invariably remain innocent as a rose, and their plight breaks your heart. On the contrary, this book makes you want to yell, ¡§Get a life!¡¨ and to take a shower afterward.<br />So, my recommendation is that because this book is in easy English (it¡¦s no James Joyce), you probably can breeze through a third of it in no time. If you like it, keep reading to the end. Otherwise, quit right there¡XYou don¡¦t have to give the novel the benefit of the doubt; the rest of it does not get any better.
B00006LSM3|5.0|First, let me say I am a huge George fan. I'm not sure everyone will find me an objective reviewer; but that's OK, because I believe George always targets (targeted) his music toward his fans. He would NOT alter his style or sound.<br />The sound on this album/CD reminds you of the Travelling Wilburys/ELO/Cloud 9 with its rockabilly roots and overall feel. The performance which is basically George, son Dhani, Jeff Lynne and long time drummer Jim Keltner (with a few guests)and production are flawless AND first class. George plays a ton of great slide guitar, and the sound is so George!<br />The songs themselves are extremely well written, reminding me of the spiritual message of Material World, but MUCH, MUCH brighter and upbeat. It is up to you the listener to decide what you want to take from these songs.<br />The title track \\"Brainwashed' is my favorite. It features a Hindu religious poem and mantra, with tabla, but is an awesome song. Again, so George! Another nice song is \\"Any Road\\" with the lyrics sarcastic and cynical \\"if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.\\" The song \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" has that \\"Crackerbox Palace\\" feel with slide guitars everywhere. Another really great song is \\"Pisces Fish.\\" If \\"Marwa Blues\\" doesn't touch your soul, you simply don't have one.<br />If you're a George fan, you'll definitely like this. If you're not a George fan; sit back and give it a listen. Don't expect to hear loud distorted guitars. Don't expect an obnoxious rumbling bass drum or bass guitar. Don't expect songs about sex and violence and \\"contemporary issues\\". If that's what you want to hear, do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one. If you want to hear some really nice songs about life with REAL meaning, give it a listen, you might be surprised. If you are a George fan, it's EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECTED!, you will not be disappointed!!! This will remind you (us) how much George will be (is) missed. Thank you so much George for leaving us this absolute masterpiece.
B00006G8HX|4.0|Though lacking the philosophical depth of The Motion Picture, and the heart-pounding action of The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock ultimately succeeds because it's primarily a character driven story, which recalls the best episodes of the original series. Spock's resurrection is handled convincingly--no magical regeneration with a shiny blue animated line here. In all aspects, Leonard Nimoy does a fine job in his directorial debut--he can clearly handle a camera and brings forth strong performances from his actors.  Robin Curtis more than holds her own in the role of Lt. Saavik, originally portrayed by Kirstie Alley.  The consistently underrated William Shatner shines here, giving a performance which is by turns somber and impassioned.  DeForest Kelley also deserves praise as the Spock-possessed McCoy.<br />Most of the special effects have held up well over the years, and the few that haven't are not overly distracting. Star Trek has never been beholden to special effects, but has generally relied upon character development and story--and this emphasis has served it well over the years.<br />The picture is identical to the first DVD issue, which improved on both the VHS and Laser Disc issues--the colors are more vibrant and crisper. The sound also has more impact than the earlier versions.<br />This is one of the few films where the theatrical cut WAS the director's cut, so there are no added scenes here.  The commentary by Nimoy and the rest is interesting and informative, as is Michael Okuda's text commentary.  The cast interviews, as always, are entertaining, although I would have liked to have heard more of what REALLY happened during the infamous 1983 fire at Paramount studios.  Less entertaining are the featurettes on terraforming, the Klingon language, and the visual effects, which contain almost no behind the scenes footage.
B00005JJX8|3.0|To Catch a Thief is the closest Hitch got to making froth in the later part of his career. It's not as suspenseful as North by Northwest, lacks the emotional power of both Rear Window and the artistry of Vertigo. Nevertheless, it's an essential, if minor, Hitchcock classic. The stunning photography by the late great Robert Burke isn't very well represented on this DVD. The colors are still muted (comparable to previous video and laserdisc editions). It's not hard to see why this won an Academy Award for best cinematography but it is difficult to appreciate it the way it was meant to be.<br />Cary Grant and Grace Kelly give marvelous, witty performances and capture the light touch of screenwriter John Michael Hayes. Sadly, Hayes is no longer around to give us his thoughts (much as he did on the Rear Window DVD). His script is a great deal of fun and Hitch's usual targets are skewered well.<br />The direction is nimble and the film fairly well paced. Really, this is a romantic thriller with the emphasis on romantic. The chases sequences are well designed and shot. They became the template for many other lesser directors (including the  overwrought films of acolyte Brian DePalma).<br />A pity that this isn't one of Hitch's more serious works otherwise it would merit a facelift and much needed make over to improve the picture quality. Hopefully someone will get around to it before the negative becomes even worse off.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This excellent cd featured the greatest songs by nirvana through out their epic career. The CD starts with the last song the group recorded together \\"You Know You're Right\\" and the next song the first one Kurt and Krist recorded together\\"About A Girl\\",  followed by many great hits from the albums Bleach, Nevermind, In Utero and the Un-plugged acoustic album, like Smells like Teen Spirit, Heart-shaped Box, Rape Me, Come As U Are, and the list goes on. This is a great album to buy and if u are an old fan or a new one this is a wonderful album to add to your collection. So im askin u to not rip the songs off the internet but pay your respects to the worlds best rock star, Kurt Cobain, R.I.P
B000002VDW|5.0|Like so many others, I first was exposed to Al Stewart via his massive hit with \\"Year Of The Cat.\\" Time Passages followed that album and was almost as successful but clearly under-appreciated. While it's true that the two Top-40 songs off this disc (the title track and \\"Song On The Radio\\") may not be among Al's best, they're still head and shoulders above a lot of what passes for popular music today...More importantly, the rest of the album is awesome: \\"Valentina Way\\" rocks, \\"Palace Of Versailles\\" is a wonderful history lesson on the French Revolution, \\"Life In Dark Water\\" is (as has been said by other reviewers) \\"haunting,\\" \\"End Of The Day\\" is gorgeous...and \\"Man For All Seasons\\" (despite the historical innacuracy of placing Thomas More under Henry II Plantagenet rather than Henry VIII Tudor) is one of my all-time favorites--brilliant lyrics (\\"Some wait for the waters of fortune to cover them / Some just see the tides of ill chance rushing over them / Some call on Jehovah, some cry out to Allah / Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhallah / While you try to accept what the fates are unfolding / While some say they're sure where the blame should be falling / You look round for maybe a chance of forestalling / But too soon it's over and done / And the man for all seasons is lost / Behind the sun\\") and a great guitar solo ...This is, truly, \\"timeless\\" stuff. Highly recommended.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Posthumous releases always seem to have the ghost of their author aboout them, with the inevitable questions:  What if he or she had lived? Then what?Fortunately, George Harrison remained a creative, energetic spirit till the end (see \\"Horse to the Water\\" on the Jools Holland cd from last year) despite the challenges of recovering from a horrific attack at his Friar Park home and later facing the ravages of cancer. This album has wry and heartbreaking allusions to his bittersweet acceptance of his mortality. It's an incredibly moving, daring album about love, faith, and humor that not only will appeal to long-time fans but also to those new to Harrison.With assistance primarily from his son, Dhani, and friends such as Jeff Lynne and Jim Keltner, George delivers 12 songs, one of which is a spirited banjo-driven cover of \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\"  The album bears repeat listening, and there are many notable moments when one can hear George expressing his fun in simply rocking out on the songs, which makes one think of the simple love he had making music in previous performances such as \\"Apple Scruffs\\", \\"Crackerbox Palace\\", and the Carl Perkins and Friends session from 1985. It appears the finality of working with his son inspired George to go for broke--it's a shame they had only worked together recently.  Some of the standout songs include the rocking \\"Any Road\\", the surreal Dylanesque \\"P.2. Vatican Blues\\",  the candid \\"Looking for My Life\\" (which would make a great single), and the scathing title track which attacks the hypocrisies of the material world with vigor.  Harrison's guitar work is magnificent (check out the heartbreaking slide instrumental \\"Marwar Blues\\") and his vocals and harmonies soulful (\\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Pisces Fish\\"). \\"Stuck Inside this Cloud\\" (perhaps an allusion to the rigors of chemotherapy and radiation treatments he endured) is one of the most distinctive, unusual pop songs to be released as a single in the new century.  As alongtime Harrison fan, I'd rank this among his very best works, solo and with The Beatles. Sonically, it comes across as mixture of ALL THINGS MUST PASS and THE TRAVELING WILBURYS, and co-producer Jeff Lynne opts for an understated mix this time around. In terms of melody and lyrics, there's plenty to enjoy, too-- real turns of phrase and shifts in tone that show a deep appreciation of blues and jazz.  Thank you, George, for your music, humor, and ongoing quest for the truth in the sound and the fury of life.
B00005RRG8|5.0|I like this more than the re-make, but I have to admit, the remake was also very good, much to my surprise . . .<br />I put this and Freaky Friday in the same category, where girls are portrayed as thinking creatures with power. The stars are all female! Okay, that being said, it was made in the sixties, so don't expect any bra burning. Brian Keith, as the Dad does get a good old fashioned sock in the eye! He also falls in a pool and is generally stumbling through the picture, being manipulated by every female within a 5 mile radius! And he plays the part to a tee.<br />Hayley Mills is great in the dual role as two twin sisters, (My husband spent his youth and come to think of it a large portion of his adult life, thinking that Hayley Mills had a twin.)separated at birth, one going to live with each parent, without knowing about the other. One twin is raised in prim and proper Boston society, while the other is your All American teen living free in California at her Dad's (giant) ranch, chewing gum, playing cards and riding horses.<br />They get thrown together by fate at Summer camp, hate each other, through a battle of pranks that will make you and your kids laugh (underwear, scissors, honey and string are all involved). They learn that they are sisters, decide to get their unmarried parents back together and switch places when it comes time to return home.<br />All kinds of complications arise, including Dad's new gold-digger girlfriend who has sunk her hooks into Dad. (You may recognize this actress, she played grown-up Patrick's snooty wife-to-be in Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell . . . they never got married either, she's also in the re-make of Parent Trap, playing gold-digger's mother and still looks fabulous!)<br />As Disney ending go, this ends , well you know, happily. A good movie for Mom's to watch with their girls.
6305212112|5.0|Folks...Kathy Bates is in this movie!  Didn't anyone see Misery?  She one best actress!  Also Jessica Tandy is in this who is well known for her work in Driving Miss Daisy which earned her best actress!  She also appeared in Cocoon, Batteries not Included and many more great movies!  If you have not seen this flick, SEE IT!  Directed by Jon Avnet, who also directed The War...another outstanding movie.  I need a fan club to help me support all these great movies!

B00006X06U|5.0|I preordered this album from Amazon and received it the day after its official release - kudos to them for their great service. Joni is in great voice. The orchestra, chorus & understated jazz backing owes much to Mitchell's original arrangements of the songs, but no less to the mood of the lyrics. Put another way, the instrumental background often echoes the mental landscape of the lyrics. The two CDs are housed in a miniature book which also includes photos of a number of of Mitchell's paintings, including self portraits, several other unidentified portraits, and images related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks (it also includes a booklet of lyrics). The painting of Bin Laden with a blonde bimbo atop his shoulders will surely provoke controversy, but as with the adjacent image of President Bush backed by a crone, Mitchell's intent is ambiguous (although there is an apparent relation to a passage in \\"Otis and Marlena\\"). The main question one may ask about Travelogue is, why did Mitchell choose to redo so many of her songs, especially now, as this may be her final recording? I think she may want to have the last word (or at least make a forceful statement) about her work. She was dissatisfied with tribute albums done in the 1990s and, while I don't know what she thought of the performances on the TNT tribute a few years back, it was a bit disconcerting to see Wynonna & Ashley Judd sing \\"Raised on Robbery\\" (although the rest of the show was a lot better). Rest assured Joni, many of us are still listening to you, rather than to poor covers of your work. Many of us also hope for more new music and painting from you in the future. Whatever the future holds, Travelogue is a beautifully presented work. I'll often listen to it in tandem with the original recordings.
B000006045|5.0|I have owned this CD for two years now.  Usually after 2 years, I dont put reviews in because I have moved on to other music genres and artists.  This is an exception.  I must spread the word.<br />When I bought Mezzanine, being from New Jersey, I had never heard of M.A.  I was pleasantly surprised and perplexed.  How come I didnt hear of this group before? The different music styles used blew my mind. I had never heard any music even slightly close to this before.  Anyways, I listened to it nonstop for at least 6 months upon purchase.  I must say it is still a great CD and is still included in my rotation.<br />I will warn you that this album is addictive.  It will suck you in.  If you are one of those singer-songwriter lyricist freaks, you may not be phased by its charm and you may not like this CD.  The lyrics are not complex, but the outstanding music makes up for that.  The music is dark, mechanical, and engineered for perfection.<br />Personal note: Over the last 3 years, I have purchased about 250 CDs.  I feel that Mezzanine, Radiohead's Kid A, Chicane's Behind the Sun, Doves' Lost Souls, Jay-Z's Blueprint, and Lincoln Park would be among the best.  Yes, this CD is that good.  If you like to chill--be sure to check out Chicane and the Doves.  Not many people (that I know) are familiar with them. They are great.
B00006M183|5.0|This is a very, very good record. It's greatness will be seen down the road once it absorbs, but I've had the cd since September so I've had an extensive amount of time to listen to it, and I have to say it's definitely one of the best. I noticed how most of the negative reviews come from individuals who are still stuck on PJ's old angst-ridden songs focused on individual struggles, but you have to understand that Ed was in his 20s and had a lot of demons to expell. Ed seemed to get most of his issues out on Ten. Since then these guys have looked outward and really defined themselves as a true rock band. The thematic quality of each song is still just as strong as on any other PJ album, including ten. This album may not have a single track that I will treat like a radio station, and play over and over until no one can stand it, but it's so good, that I can just put the album on, and I don't care what track starts up. From start to finish it's a damn good album, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes solid rock music, not just PJ fans.
B00005JLS0|3.0|In the new romantic comedy \\"Two Weeks Notice,\\" Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, a very busy attorney with no free time whatsoever. After getting tired of her self-centered boss George (Hugh Grant), she decides to call it quits. As she searches for her own replacement, George thinks he may have feelings for Lucy. The movie is very funny with witty dialogue and slapstick humor. Sandra Bullock is funny, charming, and very fun to watch. She and Hugh have great chemistry. It's kind of romance-flick, but the frequent humor makes it smooth and successful, and definitely noticeable.
B00006RU5B|5.0|After hearing &quot;Cochise&quot; on the radio, I was expecting this album to be Rage Against the Machine but with Cornell instead of Zach.<br />Except for a few tracks, I was wrong.<br />Without hearing it, you may not be able to imagine it - but take the best of both Soundgarden and RATM and you get an idea of what this album is like.<br />The only thing I miss is the politically charged lyrics.  I guess I can wait until Zach de la Rocha puts out his solo album.<br />Highly recommended!
0553208845|5.0|One of the truly wonderful books I have read and read and read again.  I keep waiting as I age to finally become so cynical that I don't appreciate it, but it doesn't happen.  I have also taught the book at the community college level with an outstanding response.  One interesting note that has been pointed out to me is the book loosely follows the narrative of the Book of Ecclesiastes from the Old Testament.  Like the speaker in that work, Siddhartha experiments with the broad aspects of life:  intellectualism, pleasures of the flesh, acquisitiveness, and so forth.  And like the speaker in the Bible he finds them all a bit wanting.<br />Ignore the reviewers who are picking the book apart on religious grounds, and so forth  -- it's not intended to be educational in that sense.  As for those who say the lessons of the book are ones that we all know -- well, I say that it's the reponsibility of great writing to PRESENT those ideas with the kinds of images that help us feel what the writer is saying.  As Sid. says -- whenever you put life's wisdom into words it sounds silly and cliched.  Hesse successfully puts the ideas into wonderful images.
0767827716|5.0|Ok---I was born in '82,,,,but when I first saw it at about 9 or 10 yrs. old--I fell in love with the car!! I love this movie!! Now, at 19 turning 20 tomorrow on Nov. 22, 2002--I own the Christine car!! This movie is about a 1958 Plymouth Fury who is possessed, but nonetheless gorgeous!!
B000002HRE|3.0|ReLoad should have been an EP, or perhaps the good tracks here could have been added to Load and made that excellent album a classic double-album.  So as an EP or second Load disc, I would add the following songs:<br />1. Fuel - a high-octane hard rocker that never fails to get your blood pumping<br />2. Memory Remains - a killer riff, scathing anti-Hollywood lyrics (quite fitting then that Marianne Faithful should make an appearance)<br />3. Devil's Dance - one of the few songs co-written by (former) bassist Jason Newstead.  Growling vocals, a demonic bass-line, and a wah-wah solo...this is a classic Metallica song.<br />4. Unforgiven II - a kind-of sequel to Unforgiven, but it appears to be from the perspective of a murderer talking to his victim.  Creepy but cool.<br />5. Where the Wild Things Are - another Newsted contribution.  It conjures up so much imagery...the lyrics here are amongst the finest ever sung by Hetfield.<br />6. Low Man's Lyric - ReLoad's answer to Load's Mama Said.  Something different from Metallica than you might expect - a mix of rock/country/folk/ballad.  It could have turned out horribly in lesser hands.<br />7. Fixxxer - starts off slow, but the tension builds into a massive crescendo.  The formula may be safe, but it features some fine playing by Hammett.<br />Better Than You, Slither, Carpe Diem Baby, Bad Seed, Prince Charming, and Attitude are nothing more than filler.  Admittedly when I first got ReLoad (way back when it came out) I quite liked Prince Charming, but after a while the banal lyrics and guitar grunt had lost their allure.<br />As a long-time fan I would still recommend this album.  Most modern CD players allow you to program in your favourite tracks, so you can spare yourself the torture of the filler that takes up half of this otherwise solid album.
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD should easily be listed as one of the best CD's of the year. This CD picks up where Californication stopped. The Chili Peppers have matured and while this CD is more mellow then any previous one to date, every song is pure Pepper magic!
0345451325|5.0|Halo: The Fall of Reach is an excellent novel!  I was very skeptical when I first read it, but I delved into it nonetheless because of how much I have followed the Halo game and the career of its developers, Bungie.  This novel surprised me becuase I was not expecting it to be very in depth.  I expected it to be too much like playing a video game and not like reading an actualy story with depth.  This review does not allow me enough room to say good things about this book and the good job Eric Nylund did!  Cheers!
B0000028WD|4.0|I didnt grow up in the 60's but I love Bob Dylan and this album is  brilliant.  I love that it boasts such a huge collection of classic artists all coming together for a vertially impromtu tribute to such a legend.  It is clearly un - rehearsed and this is what makes it so appealing.  The artists express their own interpretation of the songs and it is somewhat raw in places which provides a nice, almost commical touch.  Each song is different to the original but you can still clearly detect the respect each artist has for Dylan and you can imagine the impact and influence he had on their lives and careers.  Which was the whole point of the concert.  <br />People looking at buying this albmun should remember that this is a concert and although the CD is excellent, the Video (which I give 5 stars) is even better because the performances and the audience definately have more impact on the screen.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison was as true to himself as any person could possibly be. He never diverged from his instincts to suit popular trends or music business demands. His unique and very special guitar, song writing, and singing styles come through loud and clear in this \\"must have\\" CD.<br />A wispy happiness shines through the inimitable Harrison bluesy blend of ringing guitar and assertive vocal performance in this CD. George always had (has) something to say. The performance quality here overrides any philosphical or religious diffrences that a listener might have with George. The aural experience of Harrison's music is both joyful and comforting. George always belived that \\"everything is going to be alright\\" despite what might happen to us along the road of life.<br />Jeff Lynne handled this production with just the right amount of umphhh to instill a commercial gloss that should carry the first single to some degree of sucess. Lynne is an underappreciated producer IMHO.<br />If you buy this CD and decide that you don't like it, you may just be too young or too shallow at this point in your life to realize what you are missing. I hope that you live long enough to \\"get it\\" before you join George on the \\"flip-side\\" of existance.
B00006YXEK|5.0|The quiet Beatle left us with something fantastic to ponder in his absence. If you like the Beatles, you will love George's final effort.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The thunderous bass and\\"electric\\" guitar work of RAGE combined with one of the best rock-grunge vocalists{CHRIS}of all time, put this disc right to the top of my list! 5 STARS!
B00006RU5B|3.0|This album is not bad.  It's not sumething i would recomend for just anyone but if you are a fan of Rage or Soundgarden you might want to get it.  The single &quot;Cochise&quot; is excelent but the rest of the CD lacks the fire that makes older Rage against the machine songs like &quot;Take the Power Back&quot; and &quot;Sleep now in the Fire&quot; the masterpieces that they are.  The vocals are pretty poor.  Chris Cornell is one of the best rock vocalists of the 90s but he doesn't have the energy of Zach De La Rocha.  Tom Morrello is the man that saves this album from being a total dissapointment.  Perhaps the only people to fully appreciate the metal genius of Morello are the small aboriginal cultures in Australia that worship him as a God. Maybe.
B000003TA4|5.0|The best, what can I say.<br />Smells Like Teen Spirit: This song is a bit too much overplayed but it has never lost its vibe. This is the song where I first noticed Nirvana. 4 stars.<br />In Bloom: Great song. Kurt's friend claimed that he was singing about him. 4-and-a-half stars<br />Come As You Are: This is the song that first wanted me to demand for more Nirvana. The Guitar riff is simple but catchy and a bit spooky. 5 stars.<br />Breed: Not the greatest song on the CD but great for moshpits and also catchy. 4 stars<br />Lithium: At first I thought the song was OK but I've learned to like it. 4-and-a-half stars.<br />Polly: This song, they are trying to convey an anti-rape message.probably the softest song on the CD. 4-and-a-half stars.<br />Territorial Pissings: The hardest song on the track where he goes nuts at the end. great mosh-pit song. 4 stars<br />Drain You: In My opinion, this should have been a single. The song is amazing and catchy. 5 stars.<br />Lounge Act: Another good song. 4 stars.<br />Stay Away: This song somehow reminds me of territorial pissings and has great bass. 4-and-a-half stars<br />On A Plain: Personally I think this is better then the unplugged version. Of course very catchy and makes you want to say \\"LOVE MYSELF BETTER THEN YOU\\" along with Kurt. 5 stars.<br />Something In The Way: The guitar riff is so simple and the verses are both soft and haunting. 5 stars<br />Secret Track: Loud crap not worth listening to. 2 stars
B00006RU5B|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure what to think about Audioslave.  I haven't listened to a ton of Soundgarden, but I was a big Rage fan.  When I heard Cochise, the opening track, you get the style of Tom Morello's amazing guitar work as well as the solid drums and bass.  That deja vu to Rage days made it even odder when Chris Cornell's wail came in.  It wasn't long, however, before I got used the the change from Zach de la Rocha, and the rest of the album just rocked.  Recommended for both Soundgarden and Rage fans, but don't go into the CD expecting the same band.  An all around solid CD.
0792842723|4.0|This movie was my return to the world of James Bond after a brief hiatus, and it was certainly nice to be back. The movie's<BR>visuals alone are an adequate reason to give &quot;Goldeneye&quot; a look... Russia looks cold, physical tension looks sweaty, and you'll flinch at every bullet near-miss. The title song does not disappoint, with nifty lyrics by Bono of U2, if I'm not mistaken.<BR>Of all the older films and even the newer Bond films that succeeded it, it still stands alone as simply a great film to look at. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed a more down-to-Earth villain (a former double-o agent) that is a true field commander, matching Bond in both physical and mental strength, rather than sitting back and pressing buttons. The music is a nice update into 90's electronic-enhanced tunes, though Bond fans<BR>may miss the mix of electronic music and orchestra arrangements that was hinted at by John Barry in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, and<BR>taken into the next century by David Arnold. It's a bit funkier<BR>than we are all used to, but still aids the action adequately.<BR>But, hey? Why complain? Make it a part of your collection, and enjoy the world of Bond again in your own home. You'll realize<BR>how much you loved movies all over again!    -KS
0553278223|4.0|This collection of short stories certainly deserves the classic status it has recieved. Each story in this book is an entertaining read. The settings pull you into a bizzare world were anything is possible.<BR>However, to describe The Martian Chronicles as Science fiction is a bit of a stretch. Bradbury's vision of the future, the late nineteen nineties through the beginning of the twenty-first century, is unremarkable. He describes a Mayberry colinization of the planet Mars, complete with cozy little cottages and hotdog stands. This is completely forgiveable if you go into the book realizing it is really fantasy not science fiction. Bradbury makes up for his lack of futuristic vision with his ability to create intriguing scenarios.
0316666343|4.0|Although this book sometimes reads like pulling teeth, I think the end was marvelous. Although &quot;justice is not served&quot; in the traditional sense, it reiterates what the book is telling the reader all along - not everything in life is about fairness. Pick this book up and stick with it, even through the dull or slow parts.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Being a huge Soundgarden fan, I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this album. This band is no Soundgarden, but the album is good. It's nice to hear Chris wailing away over huge heavy grooves, but I do miss  his artistic side, which was much more seen on his solo album. Chris Cornell has the greatest voice in rock, period.  The other members of Soundgarden, in my opinion, are all better musicians than the guys from Rage. Especially the drummer. Brad Wilk just isn't that good. He can't hold a candle to Matt Cameron. But I'm not trashing those guys. They're good at what they do and come up with some of the best grooves I've ever heard. My favorite tracks on this album are &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; (love the Chemical Brothers influence). The RATM members branched out a little with Audioslave, but not too much. Maybe they just wanted to make a straight forward rocking album, which they did, but I hope that if they stay together long enough for a second album, it will contain some songs with more creativity and depth.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This movie is really good if: you expect cool looks, effects, cutting, soundtrack, camera angels, slo-mo and \\"some jerry bruckheimer style\\". I won't explain the plot because it is not needed {considering here written adjectives..}. Being a Slovakian I must say that nobody has shot the beauties of the region looking so cool. Go then with  flow and enjoy.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is unreal. I got it the day it came out, popped it in my CD player, and cranked it up loud!<BR>all things have a certain point when they are too good.<BR>This CD is too good.
B00005JM09|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Terminator movies after watching the first one back in 1987 and \\"T2\\" back in 1991, but i'm looking forward to watching \\"Terminator 3\\" next summer.  It is a little disappointing that James Cameron won't be directing this blockbuster sequel, but it should still pretty entertaining.  After hearing about our cyborg hero and his human buddy up against a female killing machine, it sounded a little funny at first, but it'll be cool to see what new powers she'll be possessing.
0385484518|5.0|This book was pretty cool. It was tight! I mean TIGHT! It shows you how you should look at every situation in your life. There are two ways you can look at things - positive or negative. Morrie lived on the positive side, which kept him happy. The best thing I like about this book is how Morrie put family and friends above the worldly clamors that are so easy to fall into. I would recommend this book to anyone that can read. It's a definite spirit lifter!
B00005JL2O|4.0|I am not sure why many reviewers and critics hated Austin Powers in Goldmember.  I thought it was incredibly funny movie and the best in the series.  Reviewers stated that Goldmember changed it's humor and that made it less hilarious.   However, every single one of those reviewers is wrong.  In Goldmember, the humor switches from toilet and dirty humor (as shown in the first and second) to complete parody.  And as everyone knows, parody is probably the greatest comedy there is.  If you disagree with me, do not continue reading this review.  In the third installment of the popular series, Austin Powers is once again pitted against Dr. Evil and his henchmen.  However, he must also face off against the sick disco lover Goldmember, a man who plans to either join Dr. Evil in ruling the world, or doing it himself.  Austin goes back in time but unfortunately releases Goldmember in our time and now must catch him.  Helping him is his father (Michael Caine)  and a disco singer from the 60's named Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles).  What follows is a bambardment of jokes, pranks, and a whole lot of fun as the most shagadelive secret agent faces off against his long time enemy.  Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great treat and the DVD is rumored to have many extra features such as documentaries and music vides.  Goldmember is definetely a must buy though I suggest not letting the younger kids watch it since it has a couple crude and sexual jokes.  Highly recommended.<br />Time: 96 minutes.<br />Directed by: Jay Roach.<BR>Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor.
0345350499|5.0|This book was ravingly recommended to me by an acquaintance several years before I finally read it.  I had listened politely to her tell me how great it is, but because I was not a fan of Arthurian legends or tales, did not put great stock in her advice.  I wish I had - I would have read it much sooner.  This book was kick a** great!  I loved the tale from the female vantage point, and I loved the story of the lost Avalon.  I have yet to recommend this book to someone who does not tell me &quot;This book was so good I gave up sleep for it.&quot;  Though I have picked up other Bradley works, even those which have a connection to Mists, Mists is the only one I have liked and been able to finish reading, the others just don't compare.  Mists is one of my all time favorite books and I average about a book a week.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Let's congrat the dead George Harrison for one more amazing Beatle-work. 'Brainwashed' is certainly the best album of George Harrison since 'All Things Must Pass' (1970). All people who like The Beatles must have this CD. All I can say is EXTRAORDINARY!
B00001NFCY|5.0|I agree with people who say the album rocks. It is definitely great rock music. But a lot of people seem to miss the spiritual quality of the music, both in the lyrics and the passion that Scott Stapp and the band deliver. This is not a religious record, but rather, it addresses issues above and beyond the routine of life; it is about the meaning of life. I don't know what the band's personal beliefs are, but this is not a specifically Christian record. I'm a neopagan, and it speaks to everything I believe and the type of concerns I think are important. It is a spiritual record that calls us to peace and love. It is also a criticism of American commercialism and our shallow culture that leads to meaningless, destructive, and self-destructive lives.
078322804X|5.0|The best of the SNL movies (&quot;Wayne's World&quot; a close second.)  The DVD is excellent and includes a scene in the movie where Elwood quits his job at an adhesives plant - which I had never known of but helps explain a stunt later in the flick.<br />The documentary was made while they were promoting the awful &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; and is pretty good, although it's obvious Dan Akroyd is pretty full of himself.<br />The music is great, the comedy still funny, and the catchphrases are the stuff of legend!  An essential for your collection.
B00006FXB6|1.0|Don't buy this album if you're buying it because you like Kyuss.  I keep hoping with each QOTSA CD release that they will do something akin to their work as Kyuss but it isn't happening.  There are a couple of good tracks on this one but more of them are embarassing rather than rockin'.  I'll probably buy the next QOTSA CD and sell it to the used shop the next week but until then I'll have to keep Sky Valley in the changer.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's classic, To Kill a Mockingbird, is an awesome book.  The book takes place in a little town in Alabama in the nineteen-thirties.  Despite not containing a real clear plot, the book's plot is full of action and excitement.<BR>  The book brings forth an unbelievable message about childhood innocence, in the form of the main character, Scout.  Excitement come from the haunted house of Boo Radley, the summer friend Dill, and a trial coming from the accusation of a raping.<BR>  Overall, the book brings forth great excitement and keeps the reader reading, as I found myself doing many times, unable to put the book down.  One of the reasons it is so exciting is the reality of it, the fact that this could have happened then.<BR>  This book is an awesome book, but not necessarily a book for everyone.  The book was not overly wordy (descriptive), and the dialogue was easy to understand.  This book is awesome.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Not as good as any Soundgarden or RATM but still very good rock and roll.  Anyone that likes either of the former bands whose members make up Audioslave should have this CD.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's so nice to hear RATM be able to rock -- and I mean ROCK --without being bogged down by the politically inspired messages so prevalent in the Zach de la Rocha years. The new voice the band has welcomed provides something of a rebirth and a cleansing of the messages that, while impactful, frequently got in the way of the band's musical superiority.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act is one of PJ's best albums to date.  I have liked every one of their CDs to some extent but this one is really, very good.  Especially great is that there are no throw-away tracks like on the last four or five albums.  For those of you who say, &quot;it's good but it's no Ten&quot; I say, thank goodness it's no Ten.  Have you listened to Ten lately; listen to it for what it is, not how you remember it.  I doubt you'll think it's that great when compared to Riot Act.  Pearl Jam, rock on and please keep on evolving.
0671721720|5.0|I really loved this book!! All of the characters (with the exception of the Masadans) were protrayed as real people with flaws and virtues. Weber manages to write a great military science fiction yarn and keeps the story somewhat grounded in reality. He doesn't shirk away from exploring the possibilities of what would happen to female soldiers fighting an enemy that views women as little more than breeding stock. <br />I loved the character of Nimitz. I am a dog person but the thought of a pet cat (or companion) who is intelligent enough to play frisbee and has real hands to catch with. Wow! Where do I get one?<br />      All of the Manticoran Naval officers come across as undeniably heroic and altruistic. Even to their deaths. They make Picard and company look like a bunch of dilettantes. When a space battle is engaged, you just don't hear about there being casualties you feel it along with the captains. When a person gets wounded they stay wounded and are not mirculously healed by story's end. Also finally somebody writes a space opera in which the crews don spacesuits before taking their ships into combat!! I have lost track of the number of sci-fi movies or stories in which you see the crew being sucked into space during a skirmish and they aren't wearing more than a t-shirt and slacks.<br />Lastly for some readers who think Weber is bashing Christians. He is not. I am a Christian and if you read carefully, it says the Masadans and Graysons don't believe Christ was the Messiah (in fact they tossed out the entire New Testament) therefore they aren't Christians. Weber doesn't really give them a name but he definitely doesn't call them Christians. So if you are worried about the morality of reading this book. Don't its a good safe read. I highly recommend it.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck's talent has never been in doubt. He has made some of the most innovative and fun music of the last decade. What had only been glimpsed until now, however, were elements such as candor, self-reflection, and poignancy. Apparently affected by recent losses in his life, Beck has made an album of sadness and depth, almost devoid of the evasiveness and light-heartedness that have colored his most popular work. Still, with an album filled with self-revelation, he manages to avoid becoming maudlin or self-pitying. His humor, not nearly as blatant as in past efforts, now is used to cushion him from despair. The music is singular in rhythm and tone, one slow and stately melody follows another. Yet the album is supplied with texture and variation by the usual broadness of Beck's influences--Country & Western, Folk, Tin Pan Alley, Middle Eastern, etc.--and by the flawless production of Nigel Godrich. And Beck's full-throated vocals provide an authority rarely called for and seldom achieved on his previous albums. Possibly his best, certainly his most moving album to date.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Track #3 &quot;Like A Stone&quot; is a great track, probably better than &quot;Cochise&quot;, but as usual the record industry along with the radio stations pick something and force it upon us. This album has 13 great songs and one okay song. Rolling Stone magazine reviewed this album and gave it a lower rating than Justin Timberlake. Maybe they should stick to putting scantily clad actresses on the cover of their mag, and stop trying to interpret music. Those who can't create tend to be the most successful critics. I am not one of them because I am great across the board, but that is very rare.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Whether this is Wilco's best album, we're not quite certain, but it certainly seems to us a natural progression from their previous excellent works and not at all worthy of all the controversy it has generated.  As one of the first bands to garner the \\"alt-country\\" tag (after breaking off from the fathers of that style, Uncle Tupelo), Wilco, under the steady guidance of leader Jeff Tweedy, take pretty, straightforward country/pop melodies and present them in a fresh and different manner. This music is spacey, jangly, and fuzzy, filled with bleeps and glitches. It sounds as if it were recorded at Sanford and Son Studios where the instruments seem to include toy pianos, alarm clocks, leaky pipes, and loose change. Rooted by Tweedy's effortlessly emotive vocals, the music is both timeless and exemplary of twentyfirst century rock and roll.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Compared to her last album, Christina Aguilera definitely makes a name for herself. She totally bust out of her bubblegum image that she tried desperately to create for herself, but wasn't as successful as Britney Spears. Which is a good thing, considering how hard it is now for Britney to get the public to accept the fact that's she's 'not a girl' anymore. And now it isn't so hard for Christina to 'grow up'<br />Anyway...that's besides the point. The album definitely puts Christina at a different level and shows her adult side. On songs such as \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" we see that side of her we never really knew she had in her. And then we really see inside Christina when she sings \\"I'm Ok\\" which just breaks my heart everytime i hear it. Her first single \\"Dirrty\\" is NOT one of the better songs on the album, but does have a good beat to it which is really the only reason why i like it.<br />But overall, the best song on the album has to be \\"Beautiful\\". No pun intended. \\"Beautiful\\" is beautiful.<br />Compared to her last album, i personally think she out did herself. But quantity wise, I think all the songs on her debut album are good as compared to this one where only a few i found to have a liking too such as \\"Can't hold us down\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Impossible\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\".<br />But quality wise, the songs that are worth listening to on 'Stripped' are excellent, and a lot better and compensate in comparisson to her debut.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Jones mixes blues, folk, country,                         cabaret, and jazz and quietly makes them pop.                     Her velvet voice soothes, seduces and                          transports. Her piano style is as confident and                   tempered as her vocals. The other musicians                       provide perfect support.The production is by the legendary Arif   Mardin,'nuff said. We have been taken by a                        number of outstanding young female artists the                    last couple of years. But what distinguishes                      Norah Jones from the rest of her contemporaries                   is her remarkable restraint. She is the                           anti-Mariah, if you will (perhaps she should add                  an 'i' to her name and become 'Noriah'). It                       remains to be seen if this quality will allow her to              compete for the attention of her peers with the                   Britneys and the Belly-Button Brigade. But for                    us grown-ups, this album is pure serendipity.
B000000W5P|5.0|To me this is what a great album is. All the tracks are unique enough to keep you listening, such as the fun and enjoyable Far Away Eyes, Shattered and Respectable. Yet, the true masterpieces here are the more well known Imagination, Some Girls and Miss You. Most of all, it all fits together in its own offbeat way. Highly recommended for any Stones fan or `70s rock enthusiast.
B000069AUI|4.0|As British darlings Radiohead have become                         increasingly experimental and dissonant in their                  music they have created a void for                            bands with a partiality towards melody, like                      Travis, Gomez and Coldplay. We liked this                         group's first cd &quot; Parachutes&quot;, but this one                      seems a quantum leap. More cohesive and,                          simply, better than their previous album, which                   bears the highlight &quot;Yellow&quot;( as opposed to                       yellow &quot;highlights&quot;), this seems to put Coldplay                  at the head of the class. This is rock that fills the             room with sound. Chris Martin's stirring vocals                   dive, twist and soar as they approach those of                    Radiohead's Thom Yorke. Martin never quit                         reaches the emotional heights that Yorke has,                     but neither does he slip into the realm of excess                 and weirdness that Yorke hangs out in. The                        mainly midtempo songs on this album are subtly                    anthemic, never strident. The sound is a wash of                 liquid guitar work, orchestral arrangements, and                  full-bodied production. If these guys can stay                    together like some venerable British bands we                     know (The Stones, The Who (sorta), The Kinks                      (kinda)), we may be in store for a lot more                       magnificent music in the future.
B00006RU5B|5.0|yeah...this cd is pretty good.  in fact, its really good.  its hella late, so this review wont be that in dept, but its a really good comback by both cornell and the remaining members of rage.  some songs u can tell its rage, and other are more cornel influenced.  still nuthing beats tool tho. TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL TOOL
B000069HKH|5.0|If you are looking here to read a deliberative,                   critically balanced, highly analytical, completely                objective review of Bruce Springsteen's latest                    album, fuhgeddaboudit! Try Rolling Stone, or                      Time Magazine, or The Today Show, or go ask                       Ted Koppel (although we're not certain any of                    them are particularly objective either). We've                    placed Bruce on such a high pedestal, you have                    to crane your neck just to get a gander of his                    scuffed, black, motorcycle boots. Perhaps                         because we are the same age, listened to the                      same music growing up, share similar working                      class roots, and hail from Joisey, Bruce's music                  has meant more to us than that of any other                      artist. Therefore we are not gonna waste your                     time babbling about his reunion with the                          E-Street Band, or the new producer, or                            September 11, or the inspirational and                            restorative songs of love, faith, determination                   and hope that sprung from the events of that                      day. Instead, we will herein attempt to succinctly                and biasedly give this cd its due using just                      eleven letters (most of them `U's) and one                       exclamation point: BRUUUUUUUCE!
B00006M183|1.0|I'm shocked by all of their positive reviews for this CD. Let me say that I am a big PJ fan, but this album is severely disappointing. There's a handful of OK tracks, but there's not even one great song or anything that stacks up to the quality of their older material. This is by far the weakest album of their career. Overall the album sounds uninspired, bland and flat out boring. Vedder's vocals even sound bored. The main problem is PJ just don't seem to be able to write good hooks anymore. It sounds like all these songs were written and recorded in one day. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pearl Jam and they are still a great live band. I have always been a supporter of their music, but \\"Riot Act\\" actually makes me think twice about ever shelling out money again for one of their albums...
B000063S6Z|4.0|In these days of accelarated time, one can go from avant-garde to old-hat in the blink of an eye. The most famous and commercially successful ( and we mean that literally, as half the cuts from his last cd, \\"Play\\" became, in fact commercials) music collagist in the business has done a brilliant job virtually recreating the sound and feel of that album. The music here, like that of its predecessor, is rooted firmly in deep soul and gospel. Moby records some of his singers live while exhuming others buried in the vaults. Add his tinkling piano and lush orchestral arrangements and we have the ingredients for another deliciously satisfying, if no longer innovative, platter.
B00006L83N|5.0|If I could figure out how to inject their music into my veins, I would do it.   The meticulous nature of their composition and playing never ceases to astonish me.   Fortunately, they are touring with Blind Guardian in the US and I will see them this weekend.   <br />I refuse to compare them to any other bands, as they are incomparable, but they have set such a high standard for creativity, excellence, and &quot;progression&quot; in their music for me at least (and there is not a hint of bombastic showmanship) that I am drifting away from many of the standard bearers in this genre.   <br />I hope they make music forever, and that the whole world buys their music so they can be rewarded for doing things very few  other musicians seem capable of doing.
B0000214F0|1.0|It is hard to imagine how sex of every description and violence of every sort could be boring, but without feeling, a focused story line, and decent acting, that is exactly what happens in Caligula.  I was titilated by the thoughts of what might happen in this movie, but my imaginings were much more exciting than the reality of the film.  Buy yourself a good book instead!
B00006LSM3|5.0|I think Brainwashed is one of the best Harrison albums, beautifully produced and mixed. Here and there it is very moving, because of the sheer beauty of its sound, especially Pisces Fish, Rising Sun and Stuck In A Cloud. George's slide-guitar licks are of a moving beauty!!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I keep my copy of this film 1n my DVD player at all times because I truly belive that all of life's problems can be solved or at least diminished if you watch Lonesome Dove long enough,lol.  Robert Duvall says that Gus McCrae is his favorite of all the characters he has played, and it shows in his performance.  It is 6 hours of pure entertainment, on every level. The Pulitzer-prize winning novel is excellent, too.  Watching this film or reading the book is a big, delicious, chocolate mental dessert, with a cherry on top.  Treat yourself!
B00006LSM3|4.0|A surprisingly beatiful sound for a Lynn production. Harrison's voice is upfront on many of the tracks, clear and most importantly, soulful, especially on Never Get Over You. It's a song that with its intro reminds one of the what we missed about the Beatles. It has a Lennon cool, McCartney sentimentality (the good kind), Ringo-like percussion changes and a Harrison spirituality that resonates.<BR>The rest of the CD finds Harrison enjoying what he does best, playing the slide, plucking away at the blues, especially on the later tracks, Devil and Blue Sea, and Rocking Chair in Hawaii. <BR>Stuck Inside a Cloud with it's sad, introspective lyrics speak of a finality Harrison no doubt knew was coming. For those of us left behind, it's a sonic milstone that reminds us to mourn but move on, humming all the way. There are some slow spots, such as Pisces Fish with its workmanship-like playing. <br />That asid, buy this CD if you want to hear the great potential few other post-solo Beatles projects have live up to. A fitting summation for a quiet, iconic music hero.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|\\"Donnie Darko\\" has just the right blend of quirky characters, scientific fascination, and narrative ambiguity to make it an instant cult classic.  While never quite as successful as its bigger budget cousins - darkly offbeat films such as \\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Magnolia\\" or the work of David Lynch - it's nevertheless a highly original and ambitious first feature which manages to impress. As does Jake Gyllenhaal, turning in a wonderfully unnerving performance as the troubled Donnie, his innocent looks making his behaviour even more chilling.  This is clearly a low-budget film, but for many audiences the grubby sound mix, poor lighting and (in places) very clunky writing will all be part of the charm.  If not, the 28-day countdown to cosmic doom will keep even the most jaded (or confused) viewers engaged.  Moreover, the late-80's fashions and songs make this film a particularly amusing 'wormhole' for the over-25's.  Dark, provocative and thoroughly entertaining.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Writer Warren Ellis wrote of 'Svefn-G-Englar' on Sigur Ros' last CD, Agaetis Bryrun: &quot;it's like God crying you a lovesong from the moon.&quot;<br />This new cd, the elusively titled &quot;( )&quot;, takes you along on a shamanic journey to the moon and parts beyond. Jonsi's ethereal vocals paint all kinds of emotional trails along the way, as the album builds and builds, culminating in the ecstatic release of track 8. A stunning aural experience. See them live if you can, and take these songs along in your head as your map.
B000001FS6|3.0|I'm a huge U2 fan and I consider it a big deal for me to tell people NOT to buy a U2 CD. It's just that this album really didn't have many good points to it. The live performances are infinitely more memorable in the movie (get the DVD) and the Sun Studio recorded stuff is middling at best. This whole record felt too self-indulgent and arrogant to me. People seem to latch onto &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;, but frankly they bested that song with &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; three years later. The DVD is so much better.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George goes out on this last album the way he live his life - with humor, dignity, and heart. The strength of his voice is evident right from the start in \\"Any Road\\", an up-tempo acoustic rocker with the wonderful line - \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.\\"<br />Making no outright references to his imminent death, the album still touches on George's outlook as it approached. There are a few more heavy handed comments on life and mysticism, such as the title track. But the best parts of the album are the finely detailed guitars, the strong emotive vocals and essentially sunny, cynical world view.<br />For some reason, this record coming out made me feel the way I did so very long ago when the new Beatles LP would arrive. This is a wonderfully fitting exit for a truly loved musician and man.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Great album.  Seems to deliver morsels of all George's best work  throughout.  Go to Georgeharrison.com for interesting album info.  I can't wait to meet him.
B00005JKL8|4.0|The trailers made this movie look rather cheesy, so my expectation were not that high for it.  It is actually not that bad.  Most of the movie was believable with only a few scenes that went over the top (James Bond action style).  That said, if you crave realistic action then Black Hawk Down is a much better movie.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Like most of his later films, Kurbrick's excellent black comedy on nuclear war was filmed in England. Dr. Strangelove is the gold standard of dark comedies and remains funny to this day. Made in the early `60s at the height of the cold war it savagely skewers the paranoia of the era.<br />Sterling Hayden's portrayal of the pathologically paranoid General Ripper is second to none. His expression of concern towards Peter Sellers with \\"precious bodily fluids\\" and their contamination by communist inspired fluoridation of the water system is one of the funniest moments ever put to film.<br />Ripper's decision to send nuclear bomb carrying bombers towards Russia without releasing the recall code sets up the stage for Dr. Strangelove. The US president attempt to warn the Russians and at the same time preparing for the inevitable with his paranoid and dysfunctional advisors.<br />There are so many memorable characters. George C. Scott's General Buck Turgidson adds some great humor with his anti-Soviet posturing in the famous \\"War Room\\" scenes and with his mistress. Sellers is great in his three roles, Group Captain Mandrake one of the only sane individuals in the film who attempt to get the code from Ripper, President Muffley and the hilarious Dr. Strangelove an ex-nazi scientist who keeps confusing just whom he's working for- the Third Reich or the US.Don't miss James Earl Jones as Lt Lothar Zogg and Slim Pickens as Maj \\"King\\" Kong.<br />Dr. Strangelove is still retains its humor. This due to the excellent casting, comedic and smart scripting and Kubricks direction. Kubrick was always a technical genius (see 2001 or Barry Lyndon), but Dr. Strangelove is also less cold than many of his films can sometimes be. It is his only comedy and one of the great films of all time.<br />The highest recommendation.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|First, If you are going to show this movie to someone warn them what it is about.  Let me also be a bit critical of previous reviewers.  The camara work in it was just as any camara work would be in a movie like this, nothing spectacular.  For good camara work I recommend The Graduate or Psycho. It also only plays on the depressing emotions.  In that respect it's like What Lies Beneath in which the whole movie is a series of cliff hangers.  This movie's sole purpose is to bring out the bad of drugs but in the most depressing way possible, and to play that emotion out in the viewer.  That alone doesn't make for a great movie.  See the Basketball Diaries, which is this movie, just toned down, and actually better.  This is the type of movie where I would have been better off to not have watched it.  There are only two movies I know of like that, this being one of them.  This seems to be the formula for what it takes to be a good movie today: Pick an emotion (whichever) and play on it as much as one can in 2 hours.  I just happen to disagree.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is still the best motion-picture adaptation of a comic-book ever made.  True, the 70's era special-effects aren't very convincing any more.  And, yes, technically, the movie is incomplete;  the plot isn't finished until we get through Superman II (Superman and Superman II are really two-halves of the same movie).  Still, this movie continues to outshine every other comic-book movie made since (including Spiderman) and for a very simple reason.  In making the film, director Richard Donner always insisted upon what he called &quot;verisimilitude&quot;, that is to say, a movie that was &quot;true to life.&quot;  Unlike so many other comic-books that get turned into movies this one takes its main subject seriously.  It never gives in to the temptation to parody itself.  That's why it works. Chris Reeve looks like he stepped right out of a Curt Swan-drawn Superman illustration and John William's music is nothing less than a cultural landmark:  heroic, soaring, emotional, glorious.  William's main theme for Superman is simply the greatest musical cue ever written for a character.  Once it is heard, it is indelibly imprinted in the listener's mind.  Having heard it, it is impossible to associate the character with any other musical signature.  This is the greatest score ever written by a great composer.  If you are one of the few people who haven't seen Superman, do yourself a favor and buy it.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I was afraid \\"Brainwashed\\" might be a weak effort, but was very pleasantly surprised to find it is one of George's best.  I honestly like every song on the cd, especially \\"Pisces Fish\\", and his cover of \\"Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". Dhani has done his dad proud!
B00005JKJA|1.0|It started out ok it was interesting and there was quite a bit of clever black humor. but after about the first 45 minuets it turned into this stupid idiotic jumble that didnt make the slightest bit on sense...I like the bizzare nature of david lynch, eraser head, blue velvet ect...but in this film he just seemed to be totally out of control. It didnt even have good acting for the most part and had to rely on lesbian sex in an effort to grasp the audiences attention and I thought that was low and too sleezy for davis lynch. a disappointment....
B00005JKG7|4.0|It's been nearly two decades since I've seen the movie so I can't say if the picture is big improvement over earlier videotape releases, but it is bright (except in the parts where it's supposed to be dark) and clear with a nice 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Carpenter's creepy electronic soundtrack stands out.<br />They managed to dig up some good bonus material for a rather old movie. There is a 1980 documentary of the film and one made for the DVD. Some of the particpants have not aged well. But it was good to see some perspective on how they felt when they made the movie and how the feel now, twenty three years later. There are storyboard to film comparisons for one scene as well as a few bloopers. Janet Leigh is rather hysterical when she flubs a line.<br />The Fog was repeated endlessly on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax and The Movie Channel when my family first got cable in 1982 or 1983 (back in the days when each service only had one channel). I saw it a number of times then, but never again after it dropped off of regular rotation. Although I don't consider it scary anymore, the novel handling of a traditional premise still holds water today, even if some of the boats in the film don't.<br />The Fog takes a standard &quot;Ghosts come back for revenge on their killers' progeny one hundred years after their deaths&quot; and gives it a unique twist by coupling the seawater engorged carcasses with a mysterious fog that takes them wherever they need to go, and causes all sorts of inconvenient things to happen, like broken power and phone lines or smashed car windows.<br />The ghosts ultimately get what they came for, which is not just the deaths of their killers' decendants, but a disproof of the old adage &quot;You can't take it with you.&quot; See the movie if you want to find out what this means.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; is a wonderful Cd.  Ms. Jones voice is very enchanting and I can't wait for more.
B000002UCO|5.0|For anyone thinking of buying this compilation, please remember that it was originally released in 1976 (well before the Dark Horse Record/Traveling Wibury years). So please don't expect to find hits like &quot;Got my mind set on you&quot; or &quot;All those years Ago&quot; or &quot;When we was fab&quot;. If you want a compilation from the Dark Horse years buy &quot;Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989&quot;. George left EMI/Apple in 1976, hence the EMI cash in compilation &quot;Best of George Harrison&quot;. It's a great compilation - in so far that the songs are faultless. However George does deserve a much better compilation which reflects the whole body of his work and in this regard this album, despite the five stars given, does fail. Hopefully EMI and the Estate of George Harrison will agree on this and produce a compilation worthy of George. As to what should be on such a compilation, well that's a very interesting question.....
B000069AUI|5.0|I agree with one reviewer, this album is even better than Parachute. I listened a lot of this album while travelling in Iceland last September. For me, the music of Coldplay conjures beautiful landscapes, melancholic autumn days, unspoiled mountains. <br />The song titled &quot;Clocks&quot; is worth the price of the album in itself.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|This film was one of the first in a series of what I call the \\"New Disneys\\". Beginning with \\"The Little Mermaid\\", the New Disneys were made to be more accessible to grown-up viewers. The New Disneys are designed with more than kids in mind, taking into account that parents are bringing the kids to the theater and have to sit through whatever the kids are watching. Another factor the New Disneys consider is the changing moral and social tastes of the public (Heaven forbid we ever have an Eminem-inspired rapper Mickey!).<br />One manifestation of a New Disney is a sexier character design than previously seen in the Classic Disneys. Here we see three buxom blondes mooning over the arrogant bad-boy, Gaston. Beauty herself is drawn in a somewhat full-figured, realistic style. The key, of course, is to add these kind of elements seamlessly. Too little, the effect will not work. Too much, and the audience will notice and react negatively (these are supposed to be kids' movies, after all).<br />New Disneys are also more politically correct, which can be grating when they push it to the Nth degree.<br />In this film, we have an interesting story that, in the best/worst Disney traditions, does not always follow the original source material faithfully. However, the animation and songs (Be Our Guest), more than make up for any deficiencies in the lack of fairy tale accuracy. We are even treated to some experimental computer animation, most notably in the famous ballroom dance sequence.<br />A great cast offers up good voice characterizations, too. It sure is nice to know that Jo Anne Worley is still working!<br />While \\"The Lion King\\" is (so far) the high water mark of the New Disneys, \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" is still an excellent work. The extras offered on the Platinum Edition are absolutely stellar, and any fan of this animated feature will be enthralled for hours just going through the bonus material.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Simply amazing! What's great about this movie is that it's the first good video game to movie transition I've ever seen! As an avid Resident Evil fan, I noticed that even though the characters and storyline differ from the popular Capcom games, many of the basic elements are still there! I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!<br />For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be disappointed! As for those who haven't played the video games before, you will enjoy this as one of the more scarier movies since Aliens!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is a NEW band that features the talents of Chris Cornell (of Soundgarden fame) and Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk (of Rage Agains the Machine). This new band l;eads an ultra sonic assault on the ears of music listeners everywhere. Chris has the vocals of a screaming banshee and the music is perfect to detail the power behind these musicians. <BR>Cochise has already become a great radio staple but songs such as &quot;Show me how to live&quot; &quot;exploder&quot; &quot;light my way&quot; are only a few more tracks that will make this album a great addition to hard music lovers everywhere. This album is highly recommended to help blow up speakers and soundsystems everywhere.
052594527X|4.0|I have to admit that I was very skeptical about this book.  I had heard a lot of people in various book clubs saying that they had really enjoyed it.  When I found it in my library I decided to give it a try even though it is not usually the genre that I try.  <BR>It did take me a little while to get into, but once I got into it I could hardly put it down.  Griet is an unforgettable character.  She is mature in some ways, but very naive in others.  She is strong, but at the same time very weak.  I felt that she was a well-defined character and very complex.<BR>The setting and descriptions were unforgettable.  Chevalier used so many ways to decribe ordinary things that I could just picture everything in my head.  The scenery and paintings were exquisite.  <BR>The only problem that I have is the character of Vermeer.  He just wasn't as drawn out as I felt that he could be.  I knew nothing of him before I read this book, so that could be just based on his personality, I don't know.  There is just not enough background information on him to really make the reader appreciate his talent.  Maybe you as the reader weren't supposed to, I don't know.<BR>Overall, I was really impressed with this book.  The images are some that I will remember for a long time to come.  Chevalier weaved a wonderful story and I will definitely try her again!
0812550706|5.0|I was very impressed with Ender's Game. There are not too many books that can hold my attention like this one has. We, being my English 1 Honors class, had to read this for an assignment. Seeing as how this was for class, I wasn't too sure about the quality of Ender's Game. In the first chapter, this book grabbed me and held on tight through the entire novel. In my opinion, this book had the right amount of action along with a splash of political and phychologic aspects. Though these elements got pretty confusing, the story fleshed it out enough for me and much of my class to understand.<br />The main character, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, goes to a Battle School to train so that he may fight an insectoid race of aliens, known as buggers. Science fiction is not my niche in novels (alliteration is fun), but killing aliens is almost always cool in my eyes. Throughout the book, Ender faces a lot of conflict, both with other characters and also within himself. I do not want to give a lot of the plot away, because Ender's Game is something you have to read and experience for yourself.<BR>     <BR>Overall, this book was very enjoyable. It was hard to put this book down, and when I did, I wanted to read it even more. I hope you decide to try this book out, and if you do, I do not think you will be disappointed.
B000005DQR|3.0|Shadow falls victim of his own hype..I've read so many good things about this album that it would have been impossible for it to live up to mine, or anyone else's expectations.  What I see is someone taking the best of what's already available, and creating a mixture of different styles, which is an achievement in itself..but def. not covering much new ground here.  His mastery of the beats is commendable, but Paul's Boutique is more interesting and was made about a decade earlier.  His flair for epic-like songs comes off as slow, and you wonder where he's going w/his songs, while his contemporaries in electronic music can achieve this desired effect much more efficiently..thus not dragging us along (ironically, he samples the heck out of Bjork on one song, who's doing a much more entertaining job portraying soundscapes similar in makeup). Still a good buy..but don't expect it to change your life.
0385484518|3.0|I thought at times was to sappy and not enough insight what mitch ablom was going though losing his professor. He didnot say how morrie changed the way saw his career as sports writer. Morrie was to sweet and didnot show enough of his faults. The best part of the book the important of family and friends.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies. Only a DVD format and DTS sound will do justice to the cinematography and the soundtrack.<BR>The storyline is gripping and thoughtprovoking. It is about how two men of the cloth (de niro and jeremy irons)react to the will of God in the best way they can to defend the natives from the greedy imperialist designs of the colonists.<BR>Why is this movie still not out on DVD in spite of it being given a sales ranking of 825 by amazon and a ranking of No.13 in Latin America. I guess this movie was released by Catalyst logic on 01.01.02 but am confused that it is not available on amazon.<BR>Is there a chance that it will be out on DVD shortly. I'm waiting.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  The characters are done remarkably well...this is one of the few movies in which many of the people who did die, I didn't want to.  The art is spiffy as well.  The weapons, vehicles, gear, and environments are downright believable for near-future space travel, unlike in other films where the prop guys just slap something together that looks cool, but doesn't have any visceral tug.  The battle scenes are well done, and the aliens themselves...don't get me started about them.  This has gotta rank up there with \\"Die Hard\\" as one of the greatest action movies of all time.
B000024D4R|5.0|Fast becoming my favourite Pink Floyd album, Animals doesn't get the recognnition of DSOTM or Wall, or even Wish You Were Here, but it could be argued that it is the superior. Including some of the hardest rock the Floyd ever produced, it features Roger Waters at his most 'foul-mouthed', controversial best, as well as contributions from all the other members, with Gilmour at his best on guitar throughout the album (some breathtaking solos). It uses dogs, pigs and sheep as metaphors for people in real life. Dogs - the ruthless tycoon business-men who will do anything to get to and stay at the top. Pigs - rich and greedy hypocritical 'fat-cats' with no morals. Sheep - mindless followers who do whatever the next one says. 'Dogs' for mine is the best song, and up there in the top three of best ever Floyd songs, along with 'Echoes' and 'Shine On'. Waters lyrics are brilliant, such as: &quot;And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around&quot;, and &quot;And when they turn their back on you, you'll have the chance to throw the knife in.&quot; 'Pigs' includes some viscious Waters' lines. Who else but Waters could write, &quot;You radiate cold shafts of broken glass&quot;? <BR>Te album begins and ends with the short and appropriate 'Pigs on the Wing 1 &amp; 2'. For the new Floyd fans, probably best to start with something like DSOTM before getting into something as heavy as this, but this is AWESOME.
B00005J6UP|5.0|On a Saturday Weekend, Brothers asthmatic Mikey (SEAN ASTIN) and Bodybuilder Jock Brand Walsh (JOSH BROLIN) are depressed about leaving the Goondocks neighboorhood. When neighborhood friends smart aleck Mouth (COREY FELDMAN), complusive eater Chunk (JEFF COHEN) and gadget inventor Data (KE HUY QUAN), dedide to drop in for a visit they take a little stroll up in Mr. Walsh's attic and discover a three hundred year old treasure map made by a legendary pirate known as &quot;One Eyed&quot; Willie. Mikey knows the story so well he even recities about the events that led to a battle a long time ago. <BR>From there this group called &quot;THE GOONIES&quot; later joined by Cheerleader Andy (KERRI GREEN)and Fishergirl Stef (MARTHA PLIMPTON) set out to Cannon Beach and embark on an adventure beyond their wildest imagination: their quest to find hidden treasure in need to save thier neighborhood and buy back their homes to stop a foreclosure from demolishing not only thier houses, but the Goondocks as well. <BR>But it won't be easy, they're are two things that stand in their way which are: The Deadly Booby Traps and The Villianous Criminal Family trio called &quot;The Fratellis&quot; (ANNE RAMSEY, ROBERT DAVI and JOE PANTOLIANO). So now The Goonies must make it past the traps, solve the riddles and outwit The Fratellis in a game of Cats and Mouses in a race against time to save the Goondocks.<BR>I have no memory of how I first fell in love with this classic, but I do know that it's the best Story from Steven Spielberg ever seen. <BR>P.S. One of Richard Donner's best directed films.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is generally regarded as one of the greatest rock albums ever produced, and it's not hard to see why. Not a bad song on the entire album, it works best when you listen to it from start to end, uninterrupted. EVERYONE should have this album, Floyd fan or not. It's a concept album about all different areas of life; life, death, money, insanity,etc. 'Money' and 'Us and Them' are brilliant and world famous. 'Time' (the second song with singing) is also superb. My favourite is definitely 'Brain Damage', which contains my favourite line in music: \\"And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, (I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\\"). The way I figure it, if that happens, you're really stuffed! It's all finished off with the fantastic 'Eclipse', which sought of rounds up everything the album has been preaching. Simply brilliant, it is the best album to start with if you haven't heard (I feel sorry for you if you haven't) Pink Floyd before.
B00005JL96|5.0|I was very surprise to see a Disney movie without a musical number and it is a welcome relief.  This one is laugh out loud funny.  I well defined story line.  Buy it, your kids and YOU will not be disappointed.
0316666343|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book, after all it seemed so ethereal, right up my alley. The story context sounded great! Boy was I cruelly disppointed. I had a very difficult time understanding the style of writing, it did not flow. I am an avid reader who has read all sorts of books from various authors, however the writing style was just a struggle. Sadly I will not buy another book from this author but I do wish her good luck.
B00006CXSS|4.0|The DVD release is fantastic.  You can read other reviews for praises, etc....  I only have one gripe--NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!  Makes it hard to watch in the evening when the little one is asleep.<br />Otherwise, love this set.
0671449028|5.0|This is absolutely wonderful and so far the only book my girls really love.  It's easy to read the story in an animated way and you can make believe with your kids that you're scrubbing up, brushing your teeth and rocking right along with the characters in the book. It's just short enough and charming enough that I haven't gotten tired of reading it to them yet :)
0060523794|1.0|I was very surprised that Amazon.com printed reviews in which the reviewers panned the book and criticized Lou's \\"saving\\" of IBM.  I sent in a  similar review to Barnes and Noble and they never included it, only including positive reviews (trying to sell books, don't want any negative comments).  <BR>My comments were (I borrowed them from an IBM manager who summarized my thoughts better than I could): <BR>In the last five years, Gerstner has reaped a profit of [$$$] million in the sale of awarded stock options. These stock options were awarded while he held the joint positions of IBM CEO and chairman. During that period, IBM spent [$$$] billion buying back its own stock to drive the price up so that executives could cash out at handsome profits.<BR>This is money that could have been spent on developing new products, attracting new talent and honoring promises made to employees and retirees. <br />Where did all that money come from? <br />Not from profit growth, which remained flat at about 2 percent per year when you strip out the retirees' pension fund surplus \\"vapor profits.\\" <br />It came from selling off large chunks of the company and its assets, laying off tens of thousands of employees and slashing pension and health care benefits for employees and retirees. In 2002 alone, IBM has quietly cut 15,000 jobs. Health benefits, which were promised \\"free for life,\\" now cost retirees a<BR>substantial amount of their pensions. Only one minuscule cost-of-living increase has been awarded pension recipients in the past 11 years. <br />The greed doesn't stop there. Now, Lou had not only been retained as chairman of the board, he has been awarded a 10-year consulting contract, with fully paid expenses at his previous salary of $2 million a year. These expenses have been conservatively estimated to be $100,000 annually. <br />Save IBM?  More like turning it into just another money grubbing corporation while lining his pockets. I would love to see a rebuttal book.  God helpus all if Lou's management methods become benchmarks for future corporate leaders.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Firstly, this is a beautifuly packaged disc! Thanks to all at Dark Horse. It comes with the CD and booklet, a Dark Horse sticker, a George Harrison Guitar pick, a poster of the cd cover and back cover (I would frame it!), and a short DVD showing the making of the CD and some video footage of Between the Devel and the Deep Blue See.  Wonderful, only regret is that the DVD isn't very long!<BR>Now onto the disc.  This truely is George's finest work in a long time. It is stunningly beautiful and at times very erie when considering he is no longer with us. I am amazed by George's planning on this and how he seems to speaking to us from the beyond.  His slide playing is exquisit. I have read a few reviews where they question who is really playing and wondering if Jeoff Lynne was playing. NO! In fact in the liner notes in the disc it states who is playing what instrument...and George's trademarks permiate this disc.  Get it!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Go back to 1995, before there was any hint of an Audioslave. Think to yourself &quot;What would happen if I took this Soundgarden cd and this Rage Against the Machine cd, and played them simultaneously?&quot;<br />Not to say this isn't a very good album, because quite honestly, I thought it was pretty great. The first single &quot;Cochise&quot; is a very good starter, just the right song to yell/sing to yourself while blasting down the highway. I enjoyed several other tracks as well, especially &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;.<br />Cornell is back at screaming his lungs out.....in a good way. That guy can really howl. And the band sounds pretty much like Rage always sounded, minus a little bit of that deep, almost funk bass sound that they'd break out occasionally. It's more of a straightforward hard rock/metal album.<br />Definitely good, just not surprising. 4 out of 5 though.
0446608955|5.0|The book \\"Walk to Remember\\" was a great book. There was alot on emotional and funny parts in this book. The setting was really confusing in the beginning because the main character  Landon was forty years old and he was telling a story about his life when he was a senoir in high school. He was telling about how he and this girl first met in drama class and in and out of school activitys. These two restless young adults had alot in common , but they never found out until the first started talking to each other when Landon needed a date for homecoming.  Landon tired asking his ex girlfriend, but she didnt want anythign to do with him. So Landon spent one whole night looking in the year book, and the next day at school he asked Jamie she wasnt so popular but Landon was despert to find someone to go with he didnt wanna serve people punch all night. Now one thing about homecoming was  Landon had to meet Jamies father the precher of there church.  After the dance they were in a drama play together.. And if u really like romantic books this is the one u should read because there are more thigns that happen but you have to read to find out.......... \\" promise u cant fall in love with me\\"
B00006YXEK|5.0|BRAINWASHED, George Harrison's first full studio album of new material since 1987's CLOUD NINE, as well as his last, is a fitting swansong to four decades of his musical legacy.  It is also worth mentioning that it is possibly his happiest recording, though his sharp wit is much in evidence throughout.  Standout tracks include \\"Any Road\\", \\"Run So Far\\", and the title song.  <br />Anyone who has enjoyed any of George Harrison's work will be pleased with this collection.  The only dissatisfaction will most likely come from the knowledge that there will be no others to follow.<br />Rest in peace, George.  And thank you for the music.
0316666343|5.0|This book was good. I found it to be well written. But, what I liked most of all, it was creative. It was a surprise. It was not what I expected. For a book that I expected to be a light read, it was quite hard and heavy. On the other hand, I took another reviewer's recommendation after finishing &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and went on to read another creative book, &quot;West Point&quot; by Remick, and, for a book that I expected to be a heavy read, it was a surprise also --- quite easy and lighthearted. I recommend both.
B00006LJ72|2.0|Agree with others. Nothing new, just recycled hits.  But I support Enya since first heard her.  And I collected possibly everything about Enya.  I buy this one as well.
B00006M183|4.0|While \\"Riot Act\\" isn't the best album they've put out, Pearl Jam has undeniably risen above the mindless swill dominating radio today.  In between the bubble gum pop, the borderline psychotic rap-rock and the over the top wailing that passes for rock, it is refreshing to listen to an album that actually has some thought put into it.  Pearl Jam really stretches its legs musically on this album, and while not always successful, this is still a complex, varied album that is fascinating to listen to.<br />It kicks off with \\"Can't Keep\\" a brooding, rumbling number with some really interesting vocals.  Like many of Pearl Jam's songs, it is open to interpretation, but on the surface at least, it seems to touch on their recurring theme of living for the day and within the moment.<br />Next is \\"Save You\\", a scorching number about trying to save someone from himself.  There is a strong overtone of overcoming addiction, although drugs are never specifically mentioned; it may be significant that Mike is pictured opposite the lyrics in the liner notes, as he has had his own battles with addiction.<br />Third is \\"Love Boat Captain\\" which is perhaps the most personal song the band has ever produced.  Dealing explicitly with the nine fans that died at the Roskilde festival during the summer of 2000, Ed does some of his best writing in this song.  He deftly juxtaposes the wisdom of the old with the despondence of the young, and finds love as the vehicle to find your way through.  A genuinely beautiful song, with unusual arrangements and a great message.<br />\\"Cropduster\\", is a rather grim song and definitely not one of my favorites.  Ed sings about the chance nature of life on Earth, which even if you agree with him, doesn't offer any redeeming message; which is odd for him.  There's some interesting rhyming on this track, and I like the way the chorus is arranged, but it's nothing special.<br />The fifth track, \\"Ghost\\" has some great lyrics, but the music is rather uninspired.  It deals with something many of us have felt post 9/11: the need to run away in order to reground ourselves, to evaluate and come to grips with the information we are bombarded with daily.  The music is kind of repetitive, although Mike (or Stone) does kind of go off at the end.<br />The next three songs form the emotional and musical heart of the album.  The first is \\"I Am Mine\\" which I'm not going to discuss, because it's been on the radio for months now.  The next track is \\"Thumbing My Way\\", which is an absolutely beautiful song.  It really shows how far Pearl Jam has come that such a mellow track can still be so powerful.  In it Ed considers coming to grips with past regrets; while it not always easy, he ultimately offers hope with the line \\"no matter how cold the winter...there's a spring around the bend.\\"  The last of the three is \\"You Are\\" which couldn't be more different from \\"Thumbing My Way\\" and its gentle melody.  The guitar is unlike anything I've ever heard, and was apparently accomplished by running Mike's guitar through a drum machine.  At any rate, it is a fascinating, haunting song with simple but intense lyrics ruminating on love.<br />\\"Get Right\\" is another lyrically straightforward song from Matt about conforming for other peoples' benefit.  That said, Ed's vocals are top notch and unusual; a very straightforward delivery without any of his trademark graveled speech.  The guitars are also fantastic; a really driving beat with some great McCready riffs.<br />Next is \\"Green Disease\\", which is a really catchy tune, with rather insipid lyrics.  I just don't understand how men who have so much money of their own can have so much resentment towards other wealthy people.  Moreover, their understanding of economics seems to be limited at best, and comes across as naïve.<br />\\"Help Help\\" is an absolute head scratcher; Ed sings the whole thing in a falsetto voice, and while there are some interesting things going on with the drums and guitars, none of it could be described as melodic.<br />The twelfth track is \\"Bu$hleaguer\\" about you know who.  There's some pretty clever rhyming on this track, but frankly, the song is beneath Pearl Jam.  It comes across as bitter and mean-spirited, and isn't at all in their tradition of having strong opinions without shouting other peoples' down.<br />Fortunately, they redeem themselves on \\"1/2 Full\\", which is maybe my favorite song on the album.  It's Pearl Jam meets electric blues, and the opening would make Stevie Ray Vaughn smile.  Ed's voice is in fine form and Matt's drumming powers the song.<br />\\"Arc\\" is just Ed wailing against a backdrop of keyboards.  It's kind of interesting to listen to (vaguely reminiscent of the Muslim call to prayer) but not a song by any stretch.<br />Finally, there's \\"All or None\\" which is in keeping with Pearl Jam's tradition of ending albums on a contemplative note.  Another mellow track, it sounds like it was written to be played in a small, smoke filled club, late at night.  It seems to be about breaking out of the patterns of the past, and moving on to something better, but as usual, that's open to interpretation.<br />Ultimately, \\"Riot Act\\" is an album with a lot of peaks and valleys, but that's what makes Pearl Jam such a powerful band.  They're willing to put themselves on the line, to throw musical curveballs, and try new things.  In this case they have produced an album of great emotional depth and enormous musical breadth.  There are some toe tappers, there are some head scratchers, and there are some really powerful and personal lyrics.  You can listen to this album just to have some great music on in the background, or you can listen to it in order to challenge yourself and what your life is all about.  And that... is what Pearl Jam...is all about.of it could be described as melodic.  <br />The twelfth track is \\"Bu$hleaguer\\" about you know who.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's first album Parachutes sparked raving reviews and good feedback from audiences around the world (including this particular one right here!) <BR>Their second outing is no different and in fact it takes Coldplay's stardom to another level.<br />\\"A Rush Of Blood...\\" is as the title states a rush of some really cool drifting soulful mellow and effective tunes that will flow straight to the head.<br />In My Place by itself sends shivers and a sweet sense of joy every time you'll hear it and sing along to those beautiful verses and chorus.<br />Politik is a straight out low key rocker with that ever so delicate sound of Coldplay.<br />If you thought that was not enough, then comes the outstanding Clocks, God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, The Scientist and Warning Sign that will mesmerize you just as much as Sparks, Spies and Yellow did on Parachutes. <br />What seems exciting to me about A Rush Of Blood To The Head is that even though it is a follow up to a successful debut album, it sounds as though it is the debut album. The band have not relyed on any new sounds or any heavier or more expensive equipment while recording this album (it's obvious from comparisons between this one and the first). Coldplay can indeed record each album with the same melodies that they recorded before and it will still sound amazing. Not that the songs on A Rush... sound like the ones on Parachutes but it sounds as if they were all written and performed during the same time when Coldplay were possibly unknowns and trying to make a break. Well, a break they did make and this album is a delight to the ears.<br />After years of prolific British talent rising, most notably Oasis, Radiohead, Travis and The Verve, Coldplay are the new breed, the new generation of British Rock talent that will score big in the charts around the world. The album's lengthy stay in the top ten on the Billboard charts could be an indication of just that, that they are here to stay, at least for now and hopefully for a longer time. I wish them luck and more beautiful albums with those sweet and not too flashy songs. To put it in a nutshell, A Rush is not your Morning Glory but it ain't your Be Here Now, it's not Urban Hymns and it's not The Man Who nor The Bends. It has an identity of its own just as much as Parachutes did. That ID was Coldplay, and they are just as celebrated as any of those bands.<br />And as the opening song Politik says \\"open your eyes...\\" Maybe it is time to open your eyes to a new Brit rock invasion of Coldplay, maybe they intended it to be more than a lyric. A statement.<br />Final Rate: 10/10<br />A+
B00003CXCQ|5.0|If you are confused by the title, it is supposed to be The one that started it all and still the fairest in the land. This was the first animated movie ever, and who knows if animation would ever be around if Mr. Walt Disney hadn't. And the has been a lot of animated movies that came out since, (too many to count) and Mr. Disney was around for most of them until his death in 1966. As the movie opens, a book opens and tells what happens to Snow White before the book is not seen. Every day Snow White's (Adriana Caselotti) stepmother the queen (Lucille La Verne) askes her magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) who the fairest in the land and the answer is the same every day, it is the queen, until one day when the Queen asks the same question again. But this time the mirror gives clues to Snow White. The Queen is so mad that she sents her huntsman to kill Snow White. But the Huntsman can't do it, so he tells Snow White to run away and never come back. (That part so like 1994's The Lion King). There was only one animated movie that was nomianted for best pitcure and that was Beauty and the Beast.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am a big fan of grunge and the \\"seattle\\" sound. It's very pleasing to me to see that there seems to be a grunge revival happening. Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Foo Fighters and Jerry Cantrell all have recent releases in record stores. Thank God. I know I am not alone in stating that the selection as of late has been less than acceptable. Nickleback? Saliva? Linkin Park? Boxcar Racer? Does any of this crap even qualify as rock anymore? Then, there was Audislave. I bought this CD only a couple of days ago and I can say, that this is without a doubt, the best CD to come out since Jerry Cantrell's Degredation Trip and Weezer's Maladroit. This is a relief from some of the crap that's being pushed down our throats lately. If you're a fan of Rage Against the Machine, you will dig this a lot. If you're a fan of Soundgarden, you will love it as well. I always liked Rage, but I thought they were missing truly exceptional vocals...and that's where Chris Cornell came in. This is a CD that is at times melodic, sorrowful and at some times it sounds like the title of the album's first single \\"Cochise\\"...sometimes it sounds like an indian on a warpath to hell. Buy this CD. Even if you aren't familiar with either of the 2 bands that have morphed to create this awesome project, if you're just a fan of good, rock, you will appreciate this. Sit, close your eyes and take in the great experience of Audioslave. <BR>   Note: If the cover slightly reminds you of a Pink Floyd cover, it's because the sleeve and cover were designed by Storm Thorgerson, the artist who designed most of Floyd's album art.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD absouletly rocks! The sound of Rage Against The Machine + Chris Cornel's voice= A must buy Album for Rock fans!
0871137380|5.0|I saw the movie, then read the book, then saw the movie again.  The movie's got nothing on the book.  The book is absolutely riveting, I could hardly bring myself to put it down.  Bowden is a reporter and he reports -- and the story is amazing.  The most thorough and detailed reporting of any battle, ever.  And since the book, unlike the movie, is 100% non-fiction, and unabridged, it lets you judge the meaning of it all.<br />Also, the movie distorts the characters of the Rangers before the battle starts, making them seem like unthinking goof-offs who were scared of going into battle, whereas the book reports that they took their jobs seriously and went on the mission with proud enthusiasm.

7119024086|4.0|First, San Guo Yan Yi is truly a masterpiece although it will be boring on the last section (That's why only 4 stars), because after Zhuge Kong Ming died, there wouldn't be any interesting heroes, except Jiang Wei (who was also not quite interesting compared with other previous heroes, such as Guan Gong, Zhao Zi Long, and Cao Cao).<BR>Second, you don't have to buy it, you can read it free... Third, try to also read Water Margin (Shui Hu Zhuan), if you really like Chinese literature, you'll probably like that.<BR>That's it!
B00006RU5B|3.0|Having been a very big Soundgarden/Rage fan this uniting of the two turns out to be somewhat of a let down. After weeks of hearing Cochise the remaining tunes don't seem to have the Umph! of the opening track. There's familiar sounds of both now defunct bands but nothing that reaches out and grabs you. Don't get me wrong after a few listens maybe it will come out and grab me but for now it seems it'll be in my has beens bin before the grammys come out in Feb. 03.
