B001BANK32|5.0|One of the best books by King.. This was the 2nd time I read it and I enjoyed the hell of of it
0670023329|5.0|A reader's perspective will vary based on your interaction with ethnic Koreans and your level of interest in the Korean peninsula. For some this will read like fiction, for others this will affect you very deeply.<br /><br />My wife was born in Seoul in the mid-1980s and for the most part was educated and raised in the heart of Seoul. She has distant relatives on her father's side that are still in the North so the subject of the North Korean government is distant but real. I read this book to learn more about North Korea as well as Koreans in general, fueled by my desire to know more about my wife's country and culture.<br /><br />I think the most glaring take-away from this book is the indifference that South Koreans show towards the plight of the North Korean people. I was in Seoul when Kim Jong-Il's death was publicly announced. I was one of the only Americans in the room and the immediate reaction of all the Koreans was directly related to concern for the Korean economy. My wife tells me that when she was in elementary and middle-school the Korean people longed for reunification. Today, North Korea is looked upon as a threat to the continued economic success achieved by South Korea over the past 50 years. Almost all Koreans I have asked say that they desire unification, but not at this time. This drastic change in perspective by North Korea's closest geographic and cultural neighbors is quite a shift for a people that share the same blood. In my estimation the materialistic and success obsessed South Korean culture has drastically affected the sympathy of South Koreans towards their brothers and sisters to the North. Only time will tell how a drastically changing North Korea will be perceived and handled in the future by the South Korean people.<br /><br />In regards to Shin's story, I would say Blaine Harden did an absolutely outstanding job communicating transparently. Some very graphic and difficult things are presented throughout this  book that I believe were absolutely central to Shin's life story. Shin himself is not over exaggerated as a hero, or even an extraordinary man, but simply someone who fought, survived and struggles with his past. Shin is an incredible man and I hope that he is able to find a way to persevere in the brave new world he has now discovered. I also hope that this book will raise awareness of the atrocities being committed against the Korean people by the DPRK.<br /><br />If you read nothing else during 2012, read this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What I expected to be a quick, forgettable story quickly turned into a \\"couldn't put it down\\" mesmerizing book.  I was totally there, an unobserved bystander watching as this family struggled to understand what was happening to them ... The ending had me in tears ... And total shock as I realized how the author completed the story!<br />  Not a book to leave off of your summer reading list by any means!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Nice set of books. This set is the hot item at my school for 6th graders at least. Nice to see them reading and excited about it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun and I really like it on the kindle fire. I dislike that you need a lot of points to get the good games but its worth it
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very fun game. at first thought it was kiddie but it's actually quite challenging as a puzzler. Addicting too. And I need more words for the minimum review, there we go.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|downloaded it when it was a free app of the day. later discovered that it refuses to work unless you are signed into the app store. hopefully the paid version does not have this malware like activity...but I'm not willing to find out.
0545265355|5.0|I flew through these books. Not very large books but the author get to the meat of th story quickly in all of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|No doubt the Lord's hand is at work in this most powerful tool that will be  used to spread His word in amazing ways. Such a useful resource,very well designed  and convenient to use.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I was a long holdout for this game and couldn't see what was keeping everyone enthralled.  Once I tried it, I could wait to get to the next level.  The only two things I don't like are that occasionally it overwhelmed my Fire and it was choppy and I still don't understand how it rates you with the stars.  Well worth the download and be prepared to lose track of time.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This show is great. I love every minute of it. I look forward to watching it each week and can't wait until I can watch season 3
1580176941|5.0|So many awesome pictures, so many great decorating ideas, so many helpful hints, so many great recipes!  Everything you would want in a Cookie Cookbook!  LOVED IT!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellant book, be ready to sit down & read non-stop.  I would suggest reading the book prior to seeing the movie.  It left me wanting more.  I could picture the outfits, the Capitol in my mind!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get it get it get it this is a really fun game I luv it. it is so much fun peace out my dawog homies
B005LAIH4K|5.0|Based upon the book by Dr. Seuss (whose name is officially part of the title), THE LORAX has been contemporized a bit making it accessible to not only super-environmental-types, but to those who were raised
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|I didn't think that Moneyball would hold my interest. Hence I passed on it when it was in theaters and I waited this long to finally watch it On Demand. Turns out that Moneyball is the best movie that I've watched so far this year.<br /><br />The movie adapts Michael Lewis's 2003 book of the same name and is the story of how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane took the team from the sound of losing to the roar of winning. Brad Pitt plays Beane and Jonah Hill plays assistant GM Peter Brand, and both were masterfully casted for the roles.<br /><br />I've heard the endless criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Moneyball and at times I felt like I was watching a video documentary of the actual Oakland A's back-office for most of the movie. Pitt can act, and Hill seamlessly stepped away from comedy for this dramatic role. The rest of the cast was great too; I thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman really was A's Manager Art Howe.<br /><br />The movie runs a little long at about 2 and a quarter hours, but the time went fast and it felt shorter than that. So that's a good thing. There's really not a lot more to say here other than to reiterate that what may seem like a boring movie on the surface is actually an uplifting, compelling movie that entertained me from start to finish. May not be a collector's item, but it's certainly worth a spot in the top of your viewing queue. Check it out.
B0024RI72U|5.0|This album is cheesy and great.<br /><br />There's lots of variety from power ballads to all out speed metal, moodier songs to more upbeat victory anthems, incredibly catchy riffs and hooks, huge vocal harmonies, good clear production, spoken word interludes, lots of what I will call \\"fairydust\\" (ie., tinkly instruments and synth touches that is the icing on a base of roaring guitars and drums), minstrel nonsense, etc.<br /><br />It is incredibly bombastic, well done fantasy stuff. It'll make you puke if you like only serious or mellow music maybe, but this album is exceptionally good fun.<br /><br />Give it a shot, it's addictive.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I read this book a couple years ago and I must say there were some very interesting concepts and studies done by Malcolm Gladwell. I definitely recommend this book for an entertaining read.
B005XT4932|3.0|Loved this movie and the music as a young teenager. Pure 'guilty pleasure' buy. If you remember it, you should pick up the DVD and CD, though it would be really damn nice if Amazon would add the movie to the Prime catalog.
0718157834|5.0|Lou Clark is about to lose her job at a cafe when the story opens. Desperate to find work, any work, because her family rely on her income, she applies for a job as a carer to Will Traynor, a quadriplegic. The job is for six months and it is well paid and Lou feels that she should be able to do it because she is used to looking after her grandfather who has had a stroke and lives with them. It is clear from the start that Will resents her presence and anything she does is wrong but gradually they build up a relationship which changes both their lives.<br /><br />If you have ever had to care for an adult you will recognise the situation. Will is bad tempered and morose. He is mourning the active and high powered life he enjoyed before a chance accident as he crossed the road led to a life of pain and dependence. Lou is full of life and speaks before she engages brain but for Will this is a major change in his life because his family pussyfoot around him and accept his bad temper. Lou fights back and gradually starts to break through Will's prickly shell.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read for anyone who has ever had to care for an adult on a long term basis. There are days where whatever Lou does is criticised and days when Will hardly speaks to her. The author portrays the situation extremely well and I found it uncomfortably true to life. In spite of the subject matter there are laugh out loud incidents and there are other times which will bring tears to the eyes of most readers.<br /><br />`Me Before You' is a long way from being chick lit - it is much deeper and darker. But it is still an enjoyable and thought provoking read, dealing, as it does, with some very uncomfortable issues which may touch many of us at some point in our lives. The characters and situations are marvellously well drawn and the contrast between Lou's family, full of love though poor and Will's family, well off but perhaps lacking in warmth is well done.
B007PAQ660|5.0|I have watched all episodes so far of this new show and really enjoy it. I look forward to each new episode and hope there will be lots of new seasons to follow this one.
B005KELW26|4.0|This case works well, I purchased a few weeks ago and I am very very happy with it so far
0345803485|1.0|This is the first review I've written on Amazon.  I felt compelled to write it because of all the hype this book is getting...now going to be a movie?  This is one of the worst books I've read.  Not only are the characters completely unbelievable, but it's insulting as a woman to read about a character like Anastasia putting up with being spanked, and basically brutalized, by this loser.  Christian is supposed to be a 26 year old successful millionare who just happens to fall upon a beautiful, innocent virgin that he \\"needs to punish and spank\\".  This is the book in a nutshell.  Please, people.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the best.ilpve itbso much I am ding to get it so much<br />the best of all I love itttttttttttttt<br />l am19 and I love it
0800177975|5.0|the movie was as i remembered it from when i saw it in the movie house.<br />Arnold carring the desert eagle is beautiful.
1400069289|5.0|I was intrigued when I read the review about how I would personally benefit from the information in this book.  I'm glad I was!<br /><br />The book has helped me indentify habits and such and hopefully I'll yet make the choice to put some action to my knowledge (don't we wish there was a book for that).  But the section on The Habits of Successful Organizations has blown me away.  I'm actively putting some of it's concept to work at my organization.<br /><br />A great read well worth the price!!!
B00667KMUO|5.0|I love the whole Harry Potter series. It started with viewing the first movie with my daughter at the start, and we have had to go to the last 3 with other fans to the midnight showings! No sex scenes and very little uncomfortable language. Good verses evil is well portrayed, where a parent's love and the loyalty of friends are the best and strongest magic! These movies are not about the dark ungodly practices of magic, but focus on doing what is right verses what is easy. They lift up honesty and integrity, chivalry and loyalty, the need for each other's support and the mutual sharing of each's talents for the greater good.
0060007737|4.0|I thought this book was very helpful and I learned a lot.  I wish I had read it when it was first published -- I would have avoided some mistakes!  I recommend it highly;  however, I would warn that there are parts that are outdated.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Life changing book. The basic building blocks to move forward in your financial world.  Whether you are a business owner, employee or Network Marketer, this is the book you must read.  The earlier the better!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not all that interesting and enjoyable for me. My adult daughters & teen-age granddaughter LOVED it. I don't like or appreciate violence - especially in children. And I don't appreciate adults being entertained by the violence of these children. Maybe it will get better by the end of the book.
B007549W62|3.0|With a slick production, and a admirable director behind the helm of this piece, I figured this was going to be one of the best of 2012.  Frontier(s) was brutal... it was of course a contrived story line, and nothing above competant acting, but showed tremendous potential as the sets were brooding, the effects were amazing, and it was \\"no holds bar.\\"  IMHO this flick missed with its scripting.  Again, great sets, competant acting, but the first half of the film falls completely flat due to the ridiculous dialogue shared between the individuals who find themselves trapped together in an apartment basement.  For some reason, this seemed to detract a lot from the film for me.  Everything else, fairly average to above average.  I did really want to enjoy this film, as I had been looking forward to it for a year or so now, but for me, it did not live up to my ever growing expectations.  However I do want to note that the third act of the film is very well done and intense.  And I did really appreciate the gloomy ending.  Overall better than most but not up to what I was hoping for....
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is amazing! it is always keeping my and my sister occupied! I HIGHLY AND STRONGLY suggest this app. amazing fun and cool! :)
1469984202|5.0|I ususally read literary fiction, but with the glowing reviews and the Omnibus version for Kindle, I thought I'd give it a shot. WOW. I seriously never thought I would feel so strongly about a post-apocalyptic story, but I loved WOOL.<br /><br />The characters are introduced quickly but thorughly and you are never quite sure what is going to happen next. I experienced the same doubts and worries as the characters; my perceptions of good and bad shifted. I can honestly say that this book was entertaining, thought provoking and over too soon.<br /><br />More, please.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it didn't mess up my kindle fire and it has my fab songs for free so its not bad art all&sect;
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Cannot speak highly enough of this....while the movie was a slight disappointment, this dvd brought me right back to Broadway....just wonderfully true to the stage production.  Then the reunion of stars: superb!  A must have for PO lovers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a little skeptical getting this book as the preview for the movie looked to be a little hyped up, but I have to say after reading this book I can't wait to see this on the big screen.  The way the auther paints a picture of this future world where the ruling class are in control of everyone and pit kids in these games to keep people from revolting is just amazing.  I could not put this book down, I found myself reading it at home, in bed, at work, at church...he he, even a couple times in the car stuck in traffic.  The only thing that would have made this book better would have been pictures of the districts and the main city that rules them all.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|This documentary fails to address the root causes of the meltdown.  I do not remember hearing one word about the Community Reinvestment Act or the role that government played in providing the environment for the bad actors to do what they do best.  Instead, they skipped over the causes and blamed the effects.
B0072QPV6I|1.0|Put the disc in and it won't recognize it under Video on the ps3.<br /><br />You can play the audio versions of the songs but not the full a/v songs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good quality didn't understand the games at first but overall a good place to spend your time when you are bored
B0064NTZKI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary, and it left me wanting more.  Wonderful selection of film clips and interviews.  I loved seeing the interviews with the\\" behind the scenes\\" people, whose names I have seen many times on the movie credits and can now put a face to the names.  I was also pleased that they acknowledged the importance of Mia Farrow's role in his life and movies.  Woody's words of praise for her, I thought were gallant.  Insights into Woody's thoughts and creative process for his film making were very interesting and has only reinforced my appraisal of him as a genius.  I hope to see the fruits of his creative labours for many years to come.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the last angry birds games were the same boring gameplay. this is a fresh entry that not only changes the gameplay but changes the enviornments too. You could tell that rovio listened to the reviews and replied with this masterpiece. I'm looking forward to the next update!
B0059XTTW8|1.0|What happened to the story line of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy? Don't both with this disjointed mishmash, read the book or see the Guiness version. As LeCarre, who is not only the author of the original story but also a \\"producer\\" here, noted in his interview: There is the book, then the film (Guiness) and now a film of the film.
0439023513|5.0|While I do not write many reviews here, for this book, I felt a bit compelled to.  While I will agree there are a number of \\"boring\\" pages in this last installment, I feel it comes from trying to place too much information in the readers minds.  Collins might have done better to have the last 2 books in this series a bit longer to fill some gaps and break of some of the more depressing pages like the breaking of Katniss and the revolution.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it was a wonderfully tragic end to the series.  Collins does a superb job of showing how even the strongest of competitors can break under the weight of loss and war (Katniss and Peeta).  A lot of reviewers here were very upset at Katniss becoming so weak, but it was essential to her character to be broken.  If she did not break, she might have never seen Coin for who she was, realized whom she loved (and why), nor would she have seen that there are no real winners in war games. If there ever was a character who did not want to be thrust into a role such as the mockingjay is was Katniss.  Again, her strength was in her survival skills and her compassion, not in leadership.<br /><br />This is where Gale comes in.  He was the unbrokern image.  Collins finally develops his character in this book. He is a simple man with \\"fire\\" and anger.  Yes, he loves Katniss, but as most of us in this world have come to know, sometimes love is not enough.  There was not more for Collins to develop in his character and that is the beauty of Gale...what you see is what you get. He was not soft and Katniss needed more than strength in the man she chose.<br /><br />The revolution is a backdrop to the story of the effects of war.  As many soldiers find, the transition from war to home is sometimes more sad than relief.<br /><br />Not being sentimental, but I found the best part of the book to be the last paragraph.  That is were we, for the last time, get a glimpse of the Katniss that we grew to love in the first book.Saying \\"Real\\" instead of \\"I Love You\\" (or some other trite response) told me she was still in there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun but you have &quot;buy&quot; games with the points you get from playing them. Other than that its great!
0062073281|1.0|There have been 129 million books written, the average American will read about 200 more before dying - why would anyone choose \\"The Fame Game\\" by Lauren Conrad as one of those books?    [...]
0307352145|5.0|Just whene i had read the first pages of this book i thought \\"God! this woman knows me better than 90% of the people do!\\" I'm one of those introverts described in the book and i'm serious when i say that no other reading ever meant so much to me. Susan really knows what she's talking about there's no doubt about it, and she goes deep in investigating the issues she deals with, it's not superficial, but it's not written in un incomprehensible medical language, on the contrary it is fluent and sometimes ironical too, but fulfilled with scientifinc researches and interviews with experts in the field. So who should read this book? Well, if it was for me, i'd make almost everyone that i know read this book, starting from my parents, they would consider my behaviour in a different way after that, not just like a sort of pathology. You'll really start trying to go deeper in judiging people with this reading i ensure you.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I had low expectations at first, but it has a great interface, relatively short times for download... everything I could wish for in an app like this.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Got it for my girlfriend and everything was there. Haha she had a hard time trying to open it but it all worked out. Thank you so much!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read a book that makes you think for several days after finishing. That is until I read this book! The Hungers Games is truly an amazing read. I couldn't put it down. Every time I went to work I couldn't wait to get home and pick up where I left off. It left me thinking all day long as to what was going to happen next. It is full of surprises that I would have never even thought of. Suzanne Collins is a very creative writer. I was always on the edge of my seat to read what was going to happen next. I even told my fiance to read it (who hardly ever reads!) well, needless to say.. he read it in a matter of three days and is on the third book within the same week. He too can't stop talking about it when he is done reading. The Hunger Games is a must read! You won't be disappointed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so awesome! It kept me on my toes the whole time! I immediatly read the second and third book, and I love the series! It isn't about violence and kids murdering each other, its about fighting to survive, love and adventure. I would definately recommend this to someone.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Loved the biographical story. But wanted more direct how he did it type data.<br />I understand how he became a seal by determination and grit.But how did he set up his scope? How many yards was he normally zeroed for Things like that are sadly omitted .

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I discovered early on after purchasing my Kindle Fire that it needed extra protection.  After checking out this product and watching a video about it, I felt very good about purchasing it.  This is a great cover that provides the extra protection needed.  It is very functional and it looks good too.  I would highly recommend it.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|First off, this thing is awesome! I'm just a teenager who loves to film skateboarding, biking, etc., but the X-GRIP really gets the job done. When I first got it, I dropped it from a small distance to make sure everything was secure. Sure enough, everything was perfect, and it is still holding up 100% after over 10 days of filming. This item fits my Sony HCR-CX110 perfectly, and it's so easy to install the camera onto the X-GRIP a two year old could do it. The grip is very comfortable, and the top attachment works great with lights and other accessories. All around, this handle is sturdy and lightweight. Plus, you can't beat the price. I almost went with the Cam-Caddie, but the price it outrageous compared to this handle, because basically your paying for the same product. Wow! What a great piece of equipment. I would recommend this product to anybody filming action sports, to a professional  video producer. Fantastic job, Opteka!
B006PTZNSY|5.0|Nicki didn't sell out on her last album she had pop mixed in it might not have been as much as this one but it's the same thing remember she blew up after super bass. Also this album is amazing i've been a nicki fan from the beginning and i don't think her experimenting and trying new things should get her titled a sell out if she would've done the exact same thing for the next couple of albums people would say she needed to try something new
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book really was terrible and insults your intelligence. The characters had no depth at all which helped to make this book as bad as it was. The sex scenes were written for shock value and after  reading a couple of them I just got bored. I read this book because a friend suggested it to me but I would never read the next two. I feel bad for wasting my money on the first one. Ignore the hype and save your money.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|Casablanca has always been one of my favorite movies. I can only guess at the number of times that I've watched it. The greatest thrill was when you could actually see it projected on the big screen. I've worn out a couple of versions of the DVD. When they announced the 70th anniversary blu-ray box set, I figured that I had to have it, if for anything else, to see how the 1080p in its original format came out. I have to admit, the boxed goodies alone are worth the price. I think the book about Casablanca as well as the drawings is an incredible addition. The coasters are kind of fun, too. However, I was very impressed with the quality of the movie. The blacks are very black and the shadows are spectacular. So I give an A+ to seeing the movie as if it was fresh out of film box. The audio is terrific. The extras are some carry overs from the last release, but they have added quite a bit about the legacy of the Warner Brothers themselves. For film buffs or film historians or even those that like trivia, it is hours of jewels.<br /><br />I've seen some very bad conversions to blu-ray of classic movies. I'm thrilled to say that they were extra careful on improving the film quality without any give backs. This is truly the way that that the film was meant to be seen. With all of the junk out there that comes with four DVD's and the ability to transfer it to your smartphone, etc., this gives you the biggest bang for  your buck without a lot of the extras that you don't need to justify the higher price.<br /><br />So, to sum up - and excellent transfer in blu-ray, one of the best I've seen in b/w. The sound quality is also wonderful. The DVD extras, while the commentaries were available on previous issues, the added hours of extras about Warner Brothers [narrated by Clint Eastwood] is terrific. The book also serves as an excellent reference. If you're a Casablanca fan like I am, this edition is a must for your library.  Enjoy it!!!
0439023513|2.0|::sigh:: I absolutely loved the first two books. This one just dragged on and was way to long. The 2nd book could have just been longer and incorporated some of the 3rd one into it. I was definitely disappointed.

B003VANOFY|2.0|I took back my World of Warcraft headphones yesterday after one year of using them.  The signal started to go out constantly which you can read up on those head phones.<br /><br />Cons: I have had these Logitech ones for less than 24 hours and the sound quality is garbage compared to the WOW ones made by CREATIVE.  Also the muffs are not as comfy.  I just can't get over the crackle sound constantly.<br /><br />Pros:  I like the MIC flip, I like the charging cord that also has a USB port built in.  Volume control and other controls on the side of the muff are sweet.<br /><br />I will be taking these back to Best Buy as soon as my new CREATIVE ones get here.<br /><br />My Use:  I work from home so Skype, Gaming, and Loud Music.  This is the only crappy product I have ever gotten from Logitec.

0062124293|4.0|Whoever feels that feminists are dour and humorless and cannot take a joke should read Moran's book. As an avid reader of the UK press, I was familiar with Moran's writing before I read the book. She isn't very well-known in the US but hopefully, that will change with this book. Part memoir and part polemic, Moran tackles everything from fashion, body image, the cult of celebrity, and even abortion. She doesn't hide or apologize that she is a feminist. Unlike many mainstream feminists writing today, Moran hails from a working-class background and came of age in the 1990s. She also isn't afraid to poke fun at herself. Reading this, I was reminded of Germaine Greer's classic \\"The Female Eunuch\\" re-written if Greer was writing today as a woman in her 30s and with a sense of humor. Even the heavy stuff-i.e., tales of her experiencing sexism and her experience of having an abortion in her 30s after having already had 2 children-still manage to have bits of humor in them.<br /><br />Overall, a great book for any woman living in these modern times including those who really don't consider themselves feminists but actually are or at least according to Moran's definition of simply believing in equality for all.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Wow this album Rocks! I know that fans of the classic Jethro Tull will complain, but for a while now I've loved Jethro Tull and hated their fans, you know, the ones that only want to hear Locomotive Breath and Aqualung. Make no mistake; this album is as good as any classic Jethro Tull of old. I am actually a big fan of Jethro Tull's 80's and 90's output. Crest of a Knave is one of my favorite albums of all time. So is Broadsword and the Beast, heck I even like Under Wraps! Thick as a Brick 2 is a refreshing full circle to the sound of the 1970's Tull. Sure Martin Barre is not present, but Florian does a great job and brings his own style with a decent amount of homage to Martin (one of the best rock guitarists of all time). Ian's flute playing is as strong as ever, sure his voice has changed, but I actually like his Serge Gainsbourg like talk-singing. Getting this album is like opening a present from an old friend, who then surprises you with his vigor and energy. Thank you Ian, you've done it again!<br /><br />Max Milano*<br /><br />*Max Milano is the author of \\"[[ASIN:1609763793 The Mechanicals of Recoleta]]\\"
B006O5YHUY|1.0|Nick Nolte looked about as confused as I was at the end of this stupid, mixed up movie, seemingly written but a bunch of monkees in a barrell.  That it actually got positive reviews confirms my belief that humanity is on the eve of destruction.  Made no sense, provided no insight into character, motivation, etcetera, start to finish.  A BAD movie.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The only reason I read this book was so I could get dragged to the movie, and to possibly understand what all the *squee Katniss* hype was all about.<br /><br />About a third of the way into the book, I was ready to not read the next one. This book didn't live up to any of what I perceived as hype about it.<br /><br />For a supposedly violent book, there was surprisingly little of it. Okay, there were a couple of graphic scenes, but they were few and far between.<br /><br />For a strong female lead, she spent a good amount of time generally being non-participatory in the story. (Here we see Katniss hiding in a tree... And now she's hunting for food... And now she's hiding in a cave...etc)<br /><br />For a book about the Hunger Games, there was a whole lot of Hunger and very little Games. (See above two points.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, and stayed buried in it {and the next two of the trilogy) for four consecutive days!  I was so attached to the characters I never wanted it to end.  I highly recommend this book, and the rest in the trilogy.
0307588335|1.0|This book was somewhat entertaining and interesting for its anecdotes but has very little value as a true tale of what went wrong at Lehman and the US financial system culminating in the crisis of 2008.  I was looking forward to reading the \\"inside story.\\"  But it quickly becomes obvious that McDonald almost constantly exaggerates, offers opinions in place of facts, and really had little inside knowledge beyond what was happening on his own trading desk, rumors and scuttlebutt, and some juicy factoids fed to him by (mostly unidentified) more senior people who actually were \\"in the know.\\"  He was fired six months before the firm went down, and apparently could not get himself another job, so he wasn't a real witness to anything that happened in its last days.  He is obsessed with pedigree, dutifully recounting the education of various personages as if it makes them smart and admirable that they went to Harvard or Wharton or wherever, as opposed to what these people did to build careers, and wears a gigantic ego on his sleeve.  But the ego seems to be misplaced.  Would Lehman really have laid him off if he was making money hand over fist for the firm from his perch on the bond trading floor?  Would he have spent the rest of the year unemployed if he was a master of the universe?  I think not.<br /><br />(Not to mention that he is an admitted huckster who proudly tells of how he lied his way into the securities business, got his job at Lehman -- as a Vice President on the convertible bond trading desk, supervising no one, not an \\"executive\\" -- because a more talented high school buddy brought him in, and was axed shortly after his buddy quit.)<br /><br />I found the book just interesting enough to keep reading by skimming through all the vitriol, blowhard asides, and tabloid-style hyperbole.  But I was offended by the constant use of insults to substitute for analysis and a true explanation of why Fuld, Gregory, and others are the villains of the story.  And the biggest problem is that it offers nothing of substance to explain why Lehman failed and the foundations of Wall Street shook that wasn't already widely known and reported in 2008.  Was it a panic run on the bank?  Was McDade held back by Fuld in his effort to downsize the balance sheet?  Why couldn't McDonald's \\"heroes\\" (Alex Kirk and Mike Gelband) save the bank when they were brought back in after Gregory walked the plank?  The discussions of credit derivatives, which obviously were a major part of the problem, are dangerously shallow and in some ways inaccurate (e.g., he lumps CDOs, synthetics, and MBS all together, and never bothers to explain the rationale behind AAA ratings for senior MBS and CDO tranches -- to him it is just \\"greed\\").<br /><br />In sum, if you really want to understand what went wrong on Wall Street and led the system to come unhinged in 2008, this book won't do it.  You are far better off reading Michael Lewis's brilliant and very entertaining \\"The Big Short\\" and Gillian Tett's really insightful \\"Fool's Gold\\" -- the latter of which comes closer than anything I've read to explaining how the better part of a generation of traders and risk managers created a monster out of mortgages and deceived themselves as to its risks.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Like many of you I heard about this trilogy on the morning news that the author and her \\"steamy\\" book was setting the nation and american women with fantasies of desire come alive. I was quick to download and began reading the trilogy on my fire. The premise of the story and characters were interesting enough to keep us turning our pages beyond fast.<br /><br />As I read further into the story (of which the BDSM lifestyle I know) I began growing tired and frustrated of the overbearing turmoil between the primary couple whose story was unfolding. The repetitive sex could have been cookie cuttered through out the trilogy and I eventually began skipping over those portions of the books. Where was this authors editors? Grammatical mistakes were a plenty leaving us very unsatisfied and angry that a New York Times best seller wasn't better written and edited.<br /><br />My biggest beef is always that people within, and outside, of the lifestyle perceive a \\"Dominant\\" as being mentally disturbed, unbalanced, incredibly narcissistic and painfully sadistic. Of which I will admit many who don't know their prospective roles usually fail miserably and do unspeakable damage to the physical/emotional well being of a true submissive. These books would certainly confuse the most naive into thinking this image painted a true synopsis of a dominant in an alternative lifestyle 24/7. This couldn't be further from the truth!<br /><br />Yes, Christians introduction was unusual and disturbing, and it took him years of therapy and love to \\"undue\\" all the damage Mrs. Robinson inflicted. But she too (Mrs. Robinson) was a really bad example of a \\"safe, sane, consenting adult\\" within a BDSM lifestyle. If She really knew the lifestyle it is about protecting a natural submissive NEVER introducing them to harm! She wouldn't have gone near him knowing she could have been thrown in jail for child molestation. Any intelligent Dominant knows these parameters and I'm bothered that now most American women have the wrong impression of what this dynamic truly consists of.<br /><br />While I did continue reading, only due to wanting an ending, I was so bored by the overwhelming sex. Ok some sex is fabulous within a good story, but don't beat us over the head having them willing and able every 6 hours with the SAME sequencing. For God sake, any 21 year old woman I know who got laid that often would be screaming to her doctor with constant vaginal infections! Give me a break! And Christian being able to recover within what 5-10 minutes raring to go again and having 2 orgasms within seconds of one another. GET REAL! I know few women in this world who orgasm just by being penetrated, hey E L James, be responsible and let young women know they have a clitoris and that's 99% responsible for helping them to reach their climax.<br /><br />I did enjoy the suspense and interweaving of drama, Jack Hyde, the Helicopter, yada yada yada, but knew what was coming long before I got to the reveal. So overall I liked the story, I felt it could have used more research and responsibilty introducing the \\"vanillas\\" to what a authentic BDSM lifestyle is all about. At least I used my Kindle Fire as an e-reader for the first time and now I'm hooked. Thanks Amazon

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved Fifty Shades of Grey! What can I say that hasn't already been said? From looking at other reviews before I started reading this book, I knew I would either love it or hate it.    Yes, it's a bit on the darker side. But to each their own ;) I found the story to be very erotic and sensual. This is certainly NOT for the typical everyday romance novel reader. You really have to embrace the darker things in life....like true dark brooding hero's....or dark chocolate ;) I absolutely loved the characters and their interaction with each other. The back and forth banter was amusing and kept me smiling throughout the book.    Christian and Anastasia shared many 'first times' together as they opened up their lives to each other. I delighted in watching them exploring new boundaries and getting to know one another.    I have not read many books with BDSM. However, I feel that it is being portrayed as an illness here. As much as I enjoyed this book, I wish the BDSM would have been depicted in a more positive light. It is not an illness, it's a preference.    I found that there were some things that were repeated a several times throughout the book. This was a bit annoying to me. I could literally skip over paragraphs because I had already read the same exact things in previous chapters. Also, when Ana refers to her 'woman parts' as \\"down there\\"...well, I just kind of rolled my eyes and moved on.    All in all, I was captivated by Fifty Shades! It is very passionate and spicy. It took me to places that fascinated my inner Goddess ;)  I'm very much looking forward to moving on in this series!!    Reviewer for WereVampsRomance.  [...]

B007QRWXJG|5.0|betty draper, now called betty francis due to her second marriage, is in a bit of a funk. this is because she no longer looks like grace kelly as one big reason.  when she goes to see a doctor to get diet pills, he tells her that all middle aged women put on weight as part of the aging process.  the look on her face was priceless and i was surprised she didn't belt the doc after hearing him refer to her as middle aged. however, she did want those pills.  the doc has another surprise for her though.  he discovers a tumor on her thyroid so she has to get tested for cancer (and we see how primitive cancer treatment was in 1966 as we go inside the cancer center).<br /><br />all of the above unleashes betty back upon us and don with a vengeance.  although lots else occurs in this episode, the metamorphosis of betty draper francis certainly dominates the episode.<br /><br />sterling cooper now has a black secretary for don as it begins to get used to the new EEO laws. don also hires the first jewish copywriter for the agency, something six years ago he said would never happen.  don is nothing if not adaptable though.  he has sensed the change in the wind in the civil liberties movement in the country and is the first to jump on the bandwagon at sterling cooper.  this is not because he is liberal or a believer.  it is because he has the vision for anticipating change, adapting to it and cashing in on it. no one else at his agency has such incredible instincts in the ad game. so it is don who now has a woman ad person (peggy), a black secretary and a jewish copywriter even though he has not the slightest interest in civil liberties!<br /><br />note: i think this jewish copywriter will be a great addition to the cast.  he was very promising in the first episode.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0345803485|5.0|I absolutley loved these three books. There is a lot of sex which gets the libido roaring. The books have some light BDSM, that I have never read before, but I liked it. I physically longed to get back to reading the books. The characters are my perfect kind of characters. He is possesive,domineering and totally into her, I find that sexy. She is strong willed and tries to hold her own. The books can be very stressful but also playful. My husband said my buying the books was the best money ever spent. He got to reap the rewards of the steamy scenes.I will definately buy her next books and I REALLY can't wait. This is my first book review ever, and I do not know the author.

I am now trying to put my music collection back together so this CD was a must buy. What i didnt expect was a full studio concert recorded just before Piano Man was released. It was very raw but i enjoyed it very much. Oh and the remastered Disc 1 was just a great as i remember. Some of Billys best songs are on this CD. A MUST FOR ANY BILLY JOEL FAN.
1612130283|1.0|I read this book because I heard good reviews. I forced myself to finish it because I hate leaving books partially finished. The writing was truly awful. There was no story (sex is not a story line). Just like twilight it is just another book about women should give up pretty much everyone and everything in their lives because a man asked (told?) them to. And I couldn't stand hearing about her inner goddess anymore!

1594744769|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I quite agree with JJ (review dated May 1, 2011): I thought the detail used by Ransom Riggs was brilliant. Although I read the novel on my Kindle Touch (and therefore didn't have the benefit of full-size photos), I felt that the included photos were almost superfluous next to the vivid detail provided by the author. There was, to me, a seamless integration of the photos into the storytelling. To be honest, when I began the novel, I thought the narrative a bit forced. Once I got past the first few chapters of exhibition however, I felt the story really began to blossom. I was able to tune out the somewhat forced introductory elements, and focus on the rich descriptions of the quaint Welsh village and its surrounding area. I read the entire novel, from beginning to end, in one night. It was storming pretty strongly outside (in real time), and the storm was the perfect backdrop for this kind of suspenseful story.<br /><br />All my life, I have had a deep love of history--both genuine and fictional. The elements I primarily look for in novels with a historical undertone (such as this) are: Organic characters and environments, both past and present. This novel was so vivid and organic that I felt as though I were actually in the scenes described. I personally have never been to the U.K., but I lived in Northern and Southern Europe for years, and felt right at home in the unique setting(s) the author provided.<br /><br />I disagree with JJ on the element of \\"language/cursing/crude humor.\\" In the context of Sol's (the main character's) age, the *relative* age of the characters he meets throughout the novel, and the significantly adult situations they all face:  I believe the \\"more-adult language\\" is not only appropriate, but authentic. I don't feel that it is gratuitous, or strictly for \\"shock value.\\" Realistically, we are all \\"teenagers\\" at some point. In my personal experience, being a teenager is a time of trying out new, more-adult behaviors (or at least trying out \\"adult\\" language).  Therefore, in my opinion, the use of strong language (both by Sol and other primary characters) fits very well in the overall environment created by the author.<br /><br />Please note: I'm NOT saying I specifically condone the use of strong language by young adults. However, I think the author's use of strong language serves a particular purpose in the context of the novel's events. In my opinion, it's not fair for people in our \\"politically-correct\\" climate to censor language that may be used by other people/characters in an appropriately-rated novel. The fact is, sometimes ugly things happen to people. It doesn't matter if those ugly events are in the form of a world war, or the tragic death of a relative (both of which are addressed in this novel). I believe it should *not* be the job of parents/guardians/educators to *censor* or prevent their children from learning about those ugly things (albeit at an appropriate time--this book is recommended for those 13 and up). Rather, it should be their job to give the proper context to, and explain, those important historical events so that the next generation of children not only understands the significance of those events, but appreciates the circumstances that led to the strong language/behavior of the characters. If that means a parent/guardian should read this or *ANY* novel before their child does: Then I say, so be it. A joint discussion between the parent/guardian and young adult about mature reading material should serve to further that young adult's understanding of the material. In that case, the focus should be on guiding a child of appropriate age through mature material, rather than focusing on some \\"questionable\\" language.<br /><br />All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this novel to any lovers of historical fiction, or those who simply love a good fairy tale. This novel combines the best of both worlds. I couldn't put it down, and am eagerly lookingforward to more work by this author!
B002ZG9788|3.0|It's difficult to know where to start when defending a film that's been almost universally excoriated. Perhaps the beginning is the best place.<br /><br />For me, the beginning was watching Ray Harryhausen's films as a kid. I saw many in first-run. \\"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\\" at the age of 9 was the first.<br /><br />The last was \\"Clash of the Titans\\", released at the same time as \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". I saw both on the same night in DC, and it was obvious Ray had gone out with a whimper, rather than a bang. \\"Raiders\\" handily eclipsed it.<br /><br />The problem with Ray Harryhausen's films was that his stop-motion sequences were /always/ the best things in them. No major studio understood how Harryhausen's effects could \\"plus\\" films that already had good scripts, acting, and direction. Only Charles Schneer at Columbia saw the potential of Harryhausen's work, but he could never get the money needed to realize that potential. *<br /><br />Harryhausen's films are a mixed bag of mediocrity. Some of them have good scripts (notably Beverley Cross's for \\"Jason\\" and \\"Titans\\"), but the direction varies from competent to poor. (Desmond Davis's helming of \\"Titans\\" is notably snooze-inducing.) The acting is similarly variable; no one should be obliged to watch Kerwin Matthews in /anything/. (It's hard to believe that Danny Kaye, who'd already made fantasy films, turned down \\"Gulliver\\". **) The films /surrounding/ Harryhausen's effects only occasionally approached the imagination and sheer stylishness of those effects. ***<br /><br />On the (very!) plus side, four of those films have Bernard Herrmann scores, \\"Sinbad\\" and \\"Gulliver\\" being of especially high quality. (Note the praise of \\"Sinbad\\"'s score in the Wikipedia article.) And \\"Titans\\" has romantic, genuinely thrilling music by Laurence Rosenthal.<br /><br />\\"Titans\\" is, to paraphrase King Arthur, \\"a rather silly film\\" (though it needn't have been). It went on to become a \\"kamp klassik\\", and there was a time when TBS ran it once a month.<br /><br />The producers (and director) of the remake were mostly people who'd seen the original as kids, and had genuine affection for it. So why is it such a bad film?<br /><br />Well... IT ISN'T. The Wikipedia article reveals an ambitious plan to create a mash-up of mythologies from multiple cultures. However clever this was, it would have thoroughly confused audiences. So the remake is principally a rethinking of the original.<br /><br />The original stuck closely to the original myth of Perseus and the Gorgon. Its changes were primarily additions to pad the story. The remake veers widely from the myth, in particular having Perseus found and raised by a fisherman, with his mother Danaë dying.<br /><br />The remake's most-important change is the introduction -- as the central dramatic conflict -- of the conceit that the pagan gods continued their existence only because humans loved and worshipped them. This isn't new; it appears in \\"Excalibur\\", \\"Dragonslayer\\" (Why is there no Blu-ray of this film, with its wonderful Oscar-nominated Alex North score?), and likely other films. Though a demi-god, Perseus opposes the old order, and wants the gods to butt out of human affairs.<br /><br />The script -- which borrows much from Beverley Cross's original -- is terse and generally free of Dumb Stuff (though the brief appearance of a character from the original, which draws a huge laugh, should have been deleted). The acting is acceptable, with Neeson and Fiennes sensibly underplaying.<br /><br />The problem is the direction. Though the remake moves along crisply, without feeling rushed, Louis Leterrier -- as too many other directors -- has little understanding of how to adjust the pace of a film. He moves flatly from scene to scene, without building tension -- then releasing and rebuilding it. I advise him to listen to the first act of \\"Die Walk&uuml;re\\", a perfect example of how this is done musically.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen's animation reflects this belief in the \\"slow build\\". Perseus's confrontation with Medusa (a superb piece of stop-motion animation, the only genuinely good thing in the original) takes its time getting started. It's a cat-and-mouse game that ratchets up the tension. The remake is almost all continuous action, without any rise/fall or give-and-take. This is particularly disappointing, as CGI lets the animators do almost anything they like, without the restrictions of manipulating physical models. This sequence would have been much better had it copied the /style/ of the original.<br /><br />Perhaps the oddest difference between the original and remake is female nudity -- the PG original had it, the PG-13 remake doesn't! In the original, we see a naked Danaë suckling Perseus, and both she and Andromeda are shown \\"butt\\"-nekkid.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is not a bad film. Like its precursor, it's silly fun, and can be enjoyed on that level.<br /><br />* It's decidedly ironic that Tinseltown -- the world's leading purveyor of fantasy -- never saw the potential of fantasy films, largely relegating them to B movies and programmers. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was supposedly framed as a dream, on the assumption audiences wouldn't accept it as \\"reality\\". Yet in \\"Dark Victory\\", Bette Davis dies quickly and painlessly of an unspecified brain disorder. I find that considerably more \\"fantastic\\" than the land of Oz.<br /><br />** \\"The Three Worlds of Gulliver\\" is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen (the Robert Halmi TV version included), because it doesn't ignore the satire at the center of the story.<br /><br />*** This is perhaps overstating the case, as even \\"mediocre\\" films can have their own styles, and be entertaining. But Ray Harryhausen's outstanding work repeatedly throws into relief the overall weakness of his films.

Like many others, from only reading this book and using personal experience, I was able to pass the exam on the first try.  The topics were explained very clearly and I felt the tips throughout the book were incredibly useful.  There are so many practice problems and exercises that all the bases for the exam are covered.  One thing I would recommend with this book is to start reading/preparing early.  I started a month before the test and wish I had more time to do all the exercises and reread sections, especially the exam tips.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book!

No longer are members of the orchestra ants in the far distance and at Ravinia (outdoor concert in Chicago area) the CSO cannot even be seen unless you shell out the big bucks for the seats; thus the sound comes through speakers on the Ravinia lawn. Finally I am right there in the orchestra in my home theater. The direction is superb as it pans in on an Oboist, the violin section, the French horn player, etc. It is like I am rediscovering classical music all over again. Any what a bargain on Amazon...$25 for the complete symphonies of Beethoven. Unfortunately many of my favorites are not on DVD or if they are the recordings are from the 1960's or 1970's. I will be patient and wait for them to come out given the new video and audio technology. Looking forward to Mahler Symphony #8 and #9 which I just ordered in Blu-ray.
B005T3AJBS|4.0|Really awesome album! A bit monotonous though...all the songs are pretty similar. Some great solos too. The lyrics are really good too.
1600597963|5.0|Beautiful jewelry pieces.  Great work and photos.  Only one error, someone confused the difference between \\"synthetic\\" gems and \\"simulant\\" gems.  Simulant stones are man made to resemble the real or natural gemstone, i.e. CZ and diamond<br />A Synthetic gemstone, is actually grown from a natural seed of the natural gemstone in a controlled environment. The synthetic (if of a good quality) will test out as the real thing, chemically, in composition,  growth structure, color etc.  An ethical gemstone dealer will always tell a buyer, whether a stone is natural, treated, a synthetic or a simulant.  Full disclosure is a vital practice.<br />This error is not important to those people who are not using genuine gemstone beads, etc.  However, there are cabochons available that resemble gemstones.  Some materials are dyed to look like Turquois.  Howlite is a good example.  Howlite is a chalky white with black matrix  running through it.  It is a stone used for beads etc, in it's own right.  This information is important to those who want to learn.
B000A88EV4|5.0|This movie... I ordered it and watched it the same night I got it. I was a fan of David Thewlis before I watched this movie and now I am a DIE HARD FAN. Mike Leigh's Naked is undoubtedly a classic, standing proudly with all the abstract favorites of the movie world like A Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, and The Rocky Horror Picture show. Dismal and dark, Naked is a movie for people with an acquired taste for stories about people at the end of their rope.<br /><br />This movie is explicitly sexual, including many scenes of rape, violence, and vulgar language, so be prepared for that. Although, for a movie so dark and serious, there are some very funny moments!<br /><br />Brilliantly written, with award winning acting and succulent morbidity, I give Naked five well deserved stars, and I hope that you love it as much as I do!
1612130283|5.0|Thought the book was fantastic.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  I have ordered the next book in the trilogy and am excited to read it!  Highly recommended for all you women out there that want to read an incredibly sexual romance!

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I can't believe I had to wait all these years to find a very sloppy copy book by the ever so famous Suzanne Collins The endings are confusing and it doesn't make any sense to me. Plus, Castor and Pollux are from Rick Riordan, and they just happened to be brothers.<br />I know that Suzanne Collins can wrap things up better if it didn't seem so awkward.
0374531269|5.0|We chose this book as a selection for our book club, and it did not disappoint. There was much to discuss.  The author transports you to a time and place that most would prefer to forget and holds you there with detailed and vivid descriptions of what it was like to be a child soldier. Anyone interested in the third world and its geopolitical realities should read this book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can leave my laptop on and use my kindle fire to open programs and watch my movies and surf the web just like if I was on my laptop but without the hassle of lugging my laptop around the house
B003Y5H574|3.0|As my header suggests, I had higher hopes for this movie.  Steve Carrel is in the same boat as Will Ferrell for me when it comes to carrying a movie.  I prefer them in supporting roles as opposed to the lead.  Thought the movie did a better job of showing a family dissolve than say the Break Up, but at some points the movie was hard to watch.  My favorite part of the film has to be where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters stay up all night.  Thought it was a very endearing scene.  The movie was worth watching for that part alone.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I bought this book, read it and my husband is reading it now. We are both quite impressed with the factual material, clarify of interpretation and balanced, logical approach to conclusions and the advise given to the reader. We are currently trying the wheat-free life and the early results are encouraging. While one can make own judgement as to the applicability of the advice to remove wheat from the diet and to decrease the carbohydrate content, I believe as many people as possible need to read this book. Then they can analyze the information and make a decision based on their analysis.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|If you enjoyed the first installment of Sherlock Holmes, you're sure to enjoy the second.  It's done in the same vein as the first.  This time Sherlock Holmes is pitted against his arch-nemesis Prof Moriarty.  Robert Downey Jr pulls out another stellar performance in the title role.  Jude Law as Dr. Watson has good chemistry with Sherlock Holmes, which makes the movie fun to watch.  Plus the continuing relationships of Dr. Watson and Mary, and you have to admire any woman who can put with Sherlock for any amount of time.  Overall enjoyable movie if not ground breaking.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is intoxicating. The author takes the reader into the forbidden world of of S&M and rags to riches story in a way that captivates you and makes you want to be the characters that she is writing about. The story lures you in and you cannot put the book down.  This is an adult book, that is full of sensual, sexual activity that makes the reader think, \\"what have I been missing\\" I highly recommend this book to adults who want to know what love, possession, and sexual freedom is all about.

B000006TZ8|5.0|Things to keep in mind when listening to this LP:<br /><br />1. Paul Weller was just 20 years old, with a couple of albums already under his belt. At the age of 20, the media at the time was already writing him off.<br /><br />2. His contemporaries were the likes of Joe Strummer, John Rotten/Lydon, Elvis Costello, Sting, Jimmy Pursey -- chedck outn what they were doing then and what they are doing now.<br /><br />3. Listen again to the Jam's 2nd Lp, This is the Modern World. How, in the space of just a few months, did Weller's writing and playing get from there to this???<br /><br />4. The whole thing lasts for less than 40 minutes, yet exquisitely it captures what it was like to be a teenager in the late 1970s in England. It SOUNDS like the TV shows of the day sounded like, its lyrics captured the dreadfulness yet anger of of what it was to be 15-17 at the time, it threw away all the limits of punk's angry nihilism, and -- above all else -- it was the bext Xmas present I ever received!!<br /><br />I have no idea whether it was Paul Weller's best moment or is one of the best albums of all time... I don't care. All I do care is that it affected me deeply then -- as a 15-year-old and now, as a codger hitting his 50s -- and changed me forever. Cheers Paul!
B007DIQB50|3.0|After an incredibly interesting Grammy Awards performance of \\"Roman Holiday,\\" one new that Nicki Minaj's follow-up to [[ASIN:B0042RUMEQ Pink Friday]] would be a manic, left-field one.  Sure enough, [[ASIN:B007NCT36U Pink Friday ... Roman Reloaded (Deluxe Version) [Explicit]]] is `all over the place.' Where Pink Friday was more `user friendly' (excluding \\"Roman's Revenge\\" of course), Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is less accessible, over-stuffed, and lacks `balance.'  That isn't to say there are no good or even great songs, but Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded feels as if it would have been better served to have been condensed, reordered, or turned into a double album.  Minaj dedicates most of the first portion on the album to rap while the second half is devoted to pop, contemporary R&B, and techno-infused dance-pop.<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" turns out to be one of the better cuts of Roman Reloaded, but is certainly off-putting upon initial listen.  Minaj begins singing the hook of the song in a British Accent, playing off her alter ego of `Roman,' not unlike \\"Roman's Revenge\\" from her first album.  The hook is bizarre and upon it's completion, Minaj raps `harder' than she's ever rapped before.  Oscillating between overt rhymes and manic vocals on the hook, the most bizarre part might be the bridge section in which Minaj lifts off the popular Christmas carol \\"O Come All Ye Faithful.\\" Yikes!  As crazy as it is, \\"Roman Holiday\\" does showcase the artist being creative and thinking outside of the box.  With successive listens, \\"Roman Holiday\\" even manages to grown on you.<br /><br />\\"Come On A Cone\\" taps Hit-Boy for a minimalistic rap production, incorporating a repetitive synth.  Nicki continues an overt rap-centric approach, delivering rather frank, `unladylike' rhymes.  Regardless weather you're offended or not, Minaj is at her best on this effort when she does not hold back.  Even better is the follow-up, \\"I Am Your Leader,\\" which features Cam'ron and Rick Ross.  Hit-Boy again delivers a dynamic, odd-ball production.  Minaj raps through two stellar verses, leaving the last two verses for Rick Ross and Cam'Ron.  \\"I Am Your Leader\\" turns out to be one of the album's best cuts, if for no other reason than the catchy, simple hook (\\"I am your leader, yes I am your leader/you're not a believer...\\"). \\"Beez in the Trap\\" features up-and-coming rapper 2 Chainz.  On the cut, in her own dirty fashion, Minaj addresses haters talking about her, etc.  The message is nothing new, but Minaj manages to execute it creatively.<br /><br />\\"HOV Lane\\" is less stellar than the previous four cuts, but is still solid.  On this cut, Nicki Minaj crowns herself as being in the same league as Jay-Z (HOV), who is largely considered a \\"God\\" in rap music.  \\"Roman Reloaded,\\" featuring Lil Wayne is quite enjoyable, continuing portray a harder-edged Minaj, accentuated by the nastiness of Lil Wayne.  \\"Champion\\" comes off as a rap festival, featuring rhymes from Nas, Drake, & Young Jeezy.  The result is a solid, though not exceptional track.  Aside from Minaj, Nas's verse (verse 4) is definitely the strongest.<br /><br />At this point, the sound of the album begins to change.  \\"Right By My Side\\" features Chris Brown and possesses more of a pop/R&B sound.  Nicky sings the first verse and hook, though she raps the final verse of the song.  While the collaboration should yield `fire,' it is luke warm.  \\"Sex in the Lounge,\\" featuring Lil Wayne and Bobby V, is merely average.  The main issue is the fact that there is nothing new brought to the table.  The theme of the song is rather corny as are the lyrics making the song just clumsy.  The album then delves into techno-/Euro-styled pop, which yields mixed results.  The best is hit single \\"Starships,\\" which manages to successfully combine aggressive raps and singing by Minaj over RedOne's production.  After that, there are three more successive RedOne productions which seems overindulgent and lackadaisically conceived.  \\"Pound the Alarm\\" and \\"Whip It\\" bring nothing new, while \\"Automatic\\" is better but not great.<br /><br />Alex Da Kid takes the production reins on \\"Beautiful Sinner,\\" but despite a killer synthesized line, another dance-savvy cut does nothing to reinstate momentum after so much `sameness.' Thankfully, J.R. Rotem's \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" changes the pace, finding Nicki Minaj singing a ballad surprisingly convincingly.  Dr. Luke's contribution on \\"Young Forever\\" is not too bad, but certainly does not `reinvent the wheel.' \\"Fire Burns\\" and \\"Gun Shot,\\" featuring Beenie Man are misses and are `skippers.' \\"Stupid H**,\\" the final cut on the standard edition is eccentric, but ends up being one of the better cuts overall.  If nothing else, it ends the album with the crazy energy that Minaj opened the album with.  The Deluxe version does little to atone for a higher price, delivering David Guetta produced \\"Turn Me On,\\" \\"Va Va Boom,\\" and \\"Masquerade,\\" all of which add little to the overall album.<br /><br />Essentially,[[ASIN:B007NCT36U Pink Friday ... Roman Reloaded (Deluxe Version) [Explicit]]]  is everybody's own call.  The album is overstuffed and even when Minaj is her most eccentric, sometimes it is a bit `too much.'  While Pink Friday was safe, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is too manic and could be better constructed.  Even so, there are some good songs.d the Alarm\\" and \\"Whip It\\" bring nothing new, while \\"Automatic\\" is better but not great.<br /><br />Alex Da Kid takes the production reins on \\"Beautiful Sinner,\\" but despite a killer synthesized line, another dance-savvy cut does nothing to reinstate momentum after so much `sameness.'

B007NZDES0|5.0|I had the honor of seeing Sade on this tour. I saved my money from the time The Soldier Of Love cd was released so that I could make sure that I had the money when the tickets went on sale. I was unemployed at the time. I was excited the month before the show up until the actual day of the concert. I was in awe over her performance. She was captivating and beautiful. I lost it and cried when she performed \\"Kiss OF Life\\". That song reminds me of the time when I was thinking of ending my life and hearing the words were so very comforting to me that's how I knew that God was real.. I cannot wait for this DVD to be released I will play it over and over again as I do with her other releases.. All hale Sade a performer that has so much class and grace to her appearence she is unreal.

1932907009|5.0|Save The Cat! is hands-down THE best book on story-telling I've ever read. In the strictest sense, it is about screenwriting, but in fact, it is much more than that.<br /><br />Blake Snyder's humorous and candid tone make the book feel like a breeze even though there is a lot to be processed.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I had gone through a number of epiphanies. Suddenly I was understanding why one movie was so gripping while another that had seemed more promising at first was a total dud. It all made so much sense now!<br /><br />If you have any interest in Screenwriting, even just as an observer, I highly recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to pass the time. not sure about random/winning deal but still a lot of fun. this is solitaire that I grew up playing and not some strange variation.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is an awesome album that captures the emotion and despair of modern America.  This isn't Maroon 5.  Springsteen is the greatest story teller since Woody Guthrie, and he can put words together that will haunt you forever.  He is a poet, the language is fluid and it comes out of his guitar hard and heavy.  Is it Born in the USA?  No.  Nor should it be.  We are at a different place in time, Springsteen has grown older, but he has easily put out one of the best albums of this year.  I'm glad he and the E-Street band are back at what they do best.  If you think you don't like it, listen to it a few times. . . he's captured us and put us on the top of the USA.

B007MDB71O|5.0|What an excellent movie.....  It is a Greek tragedy that the Marketing effort on Disney's part was such an epic fail...  This flick really deserved to do much better in the U.S.  Coming from someone who did read the books (first 3 or 4 not all) when I was a kid, the movie did a fantastic job of staying as faithful as possible.  The effects were dazzling, the music was a triumph, and the acting was definitely good enough in my book.<br /><br />Yes, the movie did have it's share of cheesiness, but hey - it's a family Disney movie and there was no more cheese factor in it than there was in the fantastic Pirates of the Caribbean movies - maybe even a little less.  Taylor Kitsch was a great John Carter, Mark Strong was - as always - a good villain.  Dominic West was great, and James Purefoy was hands down an excellent pick (Purefoy + Cianran Hinds = Rome FTW). Dafoe and Church did some noteworthy voice acting, and Woola was possibly the best pet sidekick of all time.  The best however, was easily Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris.  MAN - what an experience on the eyes.  She was tough, witty, and without a doubt the best looking thing since Lamborghinis were born.  Simply amazing, especially since she wasn't some super skinny helpless whiner - she was a butt kicker.<br /><br />Overall it was an enchanting film - made me go home and gaze up at the night sky for a good 20 minutes while humming to the theme songs.<br /><br />It would be a crime not to make the two intended sequels - there is so  much more to tell.<br /><br />Loved it.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have tried many weather apps, both free and purchased, and IMO this is the best one out there by far. My main criteria for a weather app is that it must be light on system resources, it must be able to efficiently and effectively provide information based on its current network/gps location, and it must have a good weather radar map that is easily accessible. This app meets those requirements for me and I am completely satisfied with it. While the interface may take some getting used to, once you do you quickly realize and appreciate the wealth of information provided. Additionally, the developer is very responsive to questions, input, etc. Overall a great experience and app. Keep up the great work and I look forward to using your products for a long time to come!

His main focus is on always be looking for opportunities (not just when you're out of a job) and build a network.

He gives tips on how to better use LinkedIn, which many people don't know what to do with it but put their picture and work experience.  He guarantees it a perfect breeding ground to begin a great career.<br />Great and easy read as well as intriguing.

0062183591|4.0|Professor of Behavioral Economics and NY Times best selling author, Dan Ariely, has focused on cheating & dishonesty - where does it come from? How common is it? What can we do about it? - in his \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty.\\" Cheating and dishonestly is not limited to a few but, rather, is an integral part of human nature. We are all deceivers at one time or another...no matter what we think, none of us are saints.<br /><br />Ariely's purpose is to examine the \\"rational cost-benefit\\" forces that are presumed to drive dishonest behavior but do not, while irrational forces which most think do not matter, do. The author, by using experiments, highlights \\"psychological and environmental forces that increase and decrease honesty in our daily lives, including conflicts of interest, counterfeits, creativity, and simply being tired.\\" He also looks at how others influence our understanding of right and wrong, and explores why we are willing to cheat when others benefit.<br /><br />Ariely has organized this treatise into ten chapters beginning with \\"Why is Dishonesty So Interesting?\\" followed by:<br />* Testing the Simple model of Rational Crime (get rich)<br />* Fun with the Fudge Factor (somethings are easier to steal than others)<br />* Golf (Need I Say More?) (taking the Mulligan)<br />* Blinded by Our Own Motivations (favors and tattoos color our actioins)<br />* Why We Blow It When We're Tired (willpower)<br />* Why Wearing Fakes Makes Us Cheat More (shoes, Armani, and others)<br />* Cheating Ourselves (resumes and faking it until you make it)<br />* Creativity and Dishonesty: We Are All Storytellers (tales we tell ourselves)<br />* Cheating as an Infection: How We Catch the Dishonesty Germ (one bad apple does spoil the barrel)<br />* Collaborative Cheating: Why Two Heads Aren't Necessarily Better Than One (the ambiguous boss)<br />* A Semi-optimistic Ending: People Don't Cheat Enough (Cheer up!)<br /><br />Honesty depends on the structure of our daily environment, and the conditions that influence honest and dishonest behavior. With an understanding of the forces and environmental influences, we can discover how to change our environment, avoid bad influences, and achieve better behavior.<br /><br />It is the hope of this book that you will eliminate dishonest behavior...with the increased possibility of becoming a saint!ent, and the conditions that influence honest and dishonest behavior.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins is a fantastic page turner. The author gives great detail throughout the book. Katniss the main character has to do what's necessary to keep her family alive on a day to day base. Her family being the big part of her life, she steps forward as tribute in the Hunger Games. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age o ten, especially if you're not into reading. This futuristic book appeals to both men and women because of the action, the romance, and much more..

However, I was hoping to be able to download the movie but it only does so to a kindle.  I bought my wife one of those and she says \\"it's not for watching movies\\".  Oh well, you can't win al the time.  I can still watch where ever there is an internet connection and device.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I have listened to Dream Theater CDs and I was os-so about the music. A bit to progressive for a hard rock Power Trio type guy.  I was at a local Pawn Shop and Score was playing on a big screen TV. I asked \\"Who is this\\" and the manager said Dream Theater Score. I sat there for 1 hour ( I am a regular buyer there) and ran home and bought it here on Amazon. While moving some boxes and furniture the DVD got lost and after a month of searching I just bought another ! Watching these guys play live on the DVD is awesome and a real treat and me being a Bass and 6 string player, I have really picked up some tricks & Licks.  The whole band is extremely talented!  A must have for any real rock and roll guy ( I'm 52 years old )  Buy it and Enjoy it, over and over again !  Thanks for reading my review.  Mike  [...]
B003AYPMBU|5.0|The Judas Priest buildup from Stained Class to Hell bent for Leather to British Steel marked a rise in the band that they'd maintain for several years to come. \\"British Steel\\" marked a couple big changes in the group; first, the songs began to utilize pop hooks, and second, Halford hit his peak as a vocalist. Thom Allom was also near his peak as a metal producer, and he brought Priest crashing into the mainstream. After all, what party wouldn't start rocking if you put on \\"Living After Midnight\\" or \\"Breaking The Law\\"?<br /><br />Not that Priest were becoming The Partridge Family. \\"Rapid Fire\\" kicks in with the double bass drum pound Priest became known for, and there's no way that \\"Metal Gods\\" wasn't meant as self-fulfilling prophecy. The pop-hooks of \\"Midnight\\" are offset by the menace of \\"The Rage\\" or \\"United's\\" message of metal fan unity. Hard to believe that \\"British Steel\\" arrived before there was an MTV Headbangers Ball or the glut of Metal Showcases prevalent today, so credit must be given to Judas Priest for taking \\"British Steel\\" to a level that helped make the scene possible, and laying down a playing field for it.<br /><br />A point made even more fully by the DVD bonus disc. Recorded on the 2009 tour, Priest plays the album from start to finish in its entirety, showing no signs of it's 30 years. Halford and company look like they're having the time of their lives spreading the gospel to this day of an album that took them over the brink, and the fans are lapping it up. Frankly, you can live without the DVD if you already have the 2001 Remaster, but if not, it's just a couple extra bucks and worth a spin on the telly

B005FQE2E4|5.0|Bunny Suicides and Return of Bunny Suicides are among the most disgusting books of cartoons I have ever seen. I have a warped sense of humor, so I loved them!
B001HN694K|5.0|I didn't know anything about this film, but I like Johnny Depp and my husband had bought it - so, we watched it last weekend. I plan to watch it again very soon. This film operates on several levels - but the one that was most obvious and meaningful to me is that it is clearly a coming of age film aimed at young women - or at any woman at any phase of her life who has decided to (at least consider ) taking an alternate path, or find her own way in the world. Wonderful messages. I have now begin the practice of trying to believe 6 impossible things before breakfast (or at least, before lunch!).<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough!
0525478817|5.0|I haven't read a good book ever since the hunger games and I was hoping this was going to change that. I cried more during the two days it took me to read this book then ever before. I LOVED how the book was written and how there were various twists. I thought that the book was going to end with her dying but it didn't. I couldn't put the book down and if it weren't for school i would have finished it in only one day. This book has now claimed a spot next to \\"the hunger games' as one of my favorite books.
0307266303|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was engaging, exciting, informative, and fascinating all at once.  Since reading it, I can't stop thinking about everything I learned from the book.  My runs are so much more fun and full of ease.  And I feel connected... to running, to history, and to every other person out there who loves to run.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my daughter and I play all the time. we loooovveeee it. I get points so my daughter can open new games ! thank you for an awesome game.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|found the book to be a good read but not up to the hype.  others have said what an exciting read it was, did not find that.  the story line dragged in parts.

B0064MT1QW|4.0|Towards the end of the Second World War patients are being moved from one location to another. One mortally wounded patient is in such a condition that travel is impossible. A nurse traveling along with this patient finds an abandoned villa. They deposit the patient there and she waits for his demise before planning on catching up with the convoy. We also wait as the \\"English patient\\" slowly lets his history unfold forasmuch as he can remember. But wait someone else finds out about the English patient and is determined to help them remember. As time passes we are not sure that he ever forgot. You will have to watch the movie to see how it unfolds.<br /><br />This is more of a psychological drama than it is an action movie. It's not that it moved slowly but it digresses as it moves in and out of flashbacks that you have to intricately put back together to find the full story; if there is a full story.<br /><br />I have to confess that I have not read the book. However the extra information on the DVDs explains how they compared and contrasted the movie to the book; also they had to explain the differences that makes the movie work as it has to get a different sequence in place of the book. However not knowing any different I saw this is an excellent presentation.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to take to a movie abour boxing robots without feeling I was just watching a kid's comic come to life.  Hugh Jackman was well cast as a down-on-his-luck fight promoter.  There was plenty to care about in this movie and that's what sets it apart from the \\"Tranformers\\" franchise.  Those films are all flash and effects - good effects, mind you and fun to watch, but this movie had more heart.<br /><br />Great cast, all around anda really engaging story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you hate Dystopian books, skip this one.<br /><br />Brutal. Cruel, cruel world envisioned in The Hunger Games. Children killing children for entertainment. In a way, Collins mirrors our world today in a subtle, underhanded way - don't killers vie for attention by murder sprees such as Columbine? Va Tech? Doesn't the media offer \\"reality\\" shows peopled with back-stabbing, greedy and \\"I will win short of murder\\" contestants disguised as entertainment (if you call it that)?<br /><br />Sure, there are plenty of feel-good offerings out there to choose - and that includes books. But like George Orwell's 1984 and Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, or even William Golding's Lord of the Flies - if you must have a YA read to compare - Collins' trilogy will no doubt showcase just how awful humanity can descend.<br /><br />I prefer a happier ending - I read for entertainment and that \\"justice wins in the end.\\" But I can't fault Collins for her tight, tight prose and jaw-dropping scenes, her in-depth characters and the small victories her heroine gains. I will read the next two books, although I have to get over the \\"unfairness\\" of this first one - because it promises worse for Katniss. Beware. Be very aware.<br /><br />I can always hope my future grandchildren will never see such a world.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I really liked this app until there was a tornado in the area.  All this app did was tell me when the warning expired and what the temp was!  I needed to know when to take cover.  I've uninstalled and found one with radar.
0345404475|5.0|First off I noticed some of the reviews of this being NOT the real book. My review is the actual full version that I got, my mom works at an indi book store and I had it special ordered. Just so you all know.<br /><br />Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?(the inspiration for the film \\"Blade Runner\\")was published in 1968 and is known to be a cult classic among Science Fiction readers.<br /><br />So is it classic? Being that this is my first time reading \\"DADOES\\". I would say so, it certainly was a lot of fun, the futuristic landscape of a world after the war, the air is toxic, most species of animals are extinct. But the few that remain are sold by animal dealers at an astounding price. In this era, to have a real animal is to be at the top of the social ladder, but if you have an electric cow or horse, you don't know what it is to be human.<br /><br />San Francisco Police Detective Richard Dekard(who has only his electric sheep) is a bounty hunter of Androids or \\"andy's\\". Androids have technologically advanced so far that it is near impossible to distinguish them from a human. Although Rick uses his test kit that informs him of an invading android on Earth, called the \\"Voight-Kampff\\" test.<br /><br />Rick has been hired to destroy 6 androids,the Nexus-6 version,the most advanced of all.<br />PKD lets us know what it is to be human, as we read about comparative differences of androids and humans.<br /><br />John Isodore is among another human character called a \\"chickenhead\\", or any human with any sort of handicap, even a mumbler.  At one point he chooses to go against his race and help keep the remaining few hidden.<br /><br />IMO, the only religion of this time period is called \\"Mercerism\\", and the use of a \\"empathy box\\" which has handles you grasp that gives you a one on one with Mercer, their deity.<br /><br />Its kind of embarrassing of me to say that I'm 33 and have never seen \\"Blade Runner\\", I know, don't judge. But whether you just read the book and then seethe movie(I will)or have seen the movie and never read the book, you'll enjoy this haunting future that only PKD can give to you. This wont be the last time I read this. On to the movie.

[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] It is not to perfect, it is perfect for the plot line though.<br /><br />The scary thing about these books is the fact that they could happen. Just think about it, The ice-caps are melting, We could get oceans like in the hunger games. We have nuclear supplies and could wage a war that destroys communication to the other continents, ans if they kept distort 13 a secret, what about another country? If we destroy the rain forest, the ice-caps, and our humanity (already gone in congress) We could end up like this. We could have a hunger games like situation on our hands! WE COULD ALL DIE!

B0001ARCFA|5.0|Most opinions aren't worth the text they're typed in, especially in the highly subjective world of sound. But there are common grains in headphone reviews that tend to ring true, and can help you narrow your search. I found these after comparing over a dozen pairs of phones at my local shop and I HIGHLY urge you to do the same (that experience is invaluable in narrowing your preferences). That being said - here's what caught my eyes (or rather ears) about the K240s. Firstly, yes I do own comparable over-ear phones - Sennheiser HD518s and (formerly) Audio Technica ATH-M50s. Each has their advantage, but to be quite honest, at this price range there is no 'perfect holy grail' headphone... only the one that works best for *your* tastes. So what's to like about these over my other phones?<br /><br />Compared to M50s - the K240s are very light and comfortable. This a huge point of emphasis for me, as the M50s (for me anyway) were just plain uncomfortable to wear. Reviewers complain about the M50's clamping pressure, but I found the headband was particularly unforgiving despite the padding. The M50s were also among the heaviest phones I've tried, and I was constantly aware of this weight on my scalp/head. The K240s are feather light in comparison and have a nice wide self-adjusting headband. You pop em on and you don't have to constantly fidget with them, which is quite a feat of modern engineering (especially when you consider how simple the mechanism is, ha!). Sound-wise I think the M50s were a tiny bit more extended in the high end, although they sounded very dark overall to me. I interpret the K240s to be more even-toned and warmer with a nice (but not quite as extended) bass response. In other words, the M50's had a little more punch but a little less fullness in the lower end. I enjoyed both, but the comfort issue was the nail in the coffin for my M50s.<br /><br />Compared to HD518s - the K240s still have a slight edge in comfort, although the larger HD518s are also fairly lightweight. The real difference is sound quality, and the K240s are simply more balanced than the Senns. The HD518s have an incredibly wide and lush soundstage which is not quite matched by the AKGs, but they sometimes suffer from weird resonance issues and lack much of the lower frequency bass response of the K240s. The Senns (to their credit) are easier to drive and sound \\"bigger\\" but not necessarily better.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe these headphones are a deal if you can get them for under a bill. Legendary reputation, detachable mini XLR cord, comfort, and warm even-toned sound make these a nice all-around headphone. If I had to sum them up in one or two sentences - These aren't the best in any one category, but they do cover all the bases well and are quite forgiving of recording flaws. A great all-around middle of the road headphone and an excellent headphone value when compared to others in this price range. I would buy them again in a heartbeat and they've become my current preferred phones. Very happy here.fairly lightweight.

0439023513|2.0|I saw the movie over the weekend to preview for my almost 12-year-old (the answer is \\"not yet\\" and she's not happy - oh well).  I was intrigued so I read all three books.  Loved the first two.  Devoured them.<br /><br />Then Mockingjay.  Wow.<br /><br />I'm so totally disappointed.  I've read a bunch of reviews.  I really agree with what many of you have had to say about your disappointment with this book.  I'm nowhere near able to write a review of the writing or anything...this is just my reaction as a reader of the story.  Katniss as a character just dissolves.  Someone somewhere else said, and I agree, that I wouldn't have really cared that much if Katniss died.  She wasn't a hero.  She wasn't a failure.  She wasn't anything. She was hollow, a nothing.  That's just boring.  I guess that was supposed to be a lesson on how awful war is?  Not like we don't know that already.  I'm so tired of anti-war lectures.<br /><br />There was such brilliance to the whole revolution idea.  The idea that tyrannical governments can deprive people of their humanity.  But humans have inner strength to overcome tyranny.  The idea that Katniss could provide that spark. The idea that District 13 could be a beacon of hope and sanity and human determination and perseverance.  Then it turns out there was just more weirdness and cruelty in 13.  So what's the meaning there?  That all governments are bad?  That all leaders are bad? Strange.  I was really hoping for a resolution to what happened in the country at the end.  Did the people merely survive?  Or did they create a place of freedom and peace? How did the new president work out?  Did she create a republic and liberty?  If not, why not?  That would have made an awesome epilogue.  And it was strange and disappointing in the way that certain people died off.  Prim, obviously.  Gale vanishes into the world without a trace.  Katniss's mom, really? She doesn't want to see her daughter?  Finnick?  For crying out loud.  He gets killed off like one of those no-name red shirts in Star Trek.  Peeta, the one character who really had something interesting going for him, the one guy who knew from the very beginning that he didn't want to come out of the games a changed person, dead or alive.  What a story that would have been!  Instead, he plants primroses and we're supposed to get something from that?  And come on, Katniss gets a trial but she's drugged up for the whole thing?<br /><br />I really held out hope in those last few pages.  That there would be some meaning.  But alas, anti-war preaching really has no point other than to preach from on-high.  It's so one-dimensional.  Bah.  Sorry for the rant.
B00004XQ83|4.0|The movie was great, in part because of the wonderful music.  This soundtrack captures the music - including the hit \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\".  If you liked the movie, you'll love this CD.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this trilogy, Delirium, so I obviously purchased Pandemonium up right away and finished it in a day.<br /><br />It seems that Lena did all of the things you didn't want her to do in this story. I thought for sure after healing up she would have set out to find out what happened to not only Alex but her Mother. Miraculously, the things she obsessed about in the first book didn't seem to define her anymore.<br />I don't buy that a character in her position would have automatically believed that Alex was dead. She would have fought her way back to at least find out what happened to him.<br /><br />While the story was not exactly predictable in the second book, it was very obvious that Alex would make a come back. I just didn't think the author would make it the very last sentences of the book. That was so infuriating to be left hanging after waiting the entire book for him to come back.<br /><br />I was also extremely turned off by her \\"falling in love\\" with someone else. Not only because I knew Alex would be coming back but because I didn't connect with him in the story at all. I didn't think he was a match for Lena's character.<br /><br />It was almost as if this book was just a stepping stone to the third book. None of what happened in this book interested me, it was all just a waiting game for Alex to come back. And now Lena will obviously have to choose between the two guys, and from Alex's words it sounds as if he may have either been cured or gone crazy. I know from the book 'Before I Fall' Lauren Oliver can deliver a disappointing ending. Not bad, just not at all what you wanted. I'm hoping that the third book of this trilogy won't hold the same fate.<br /><br />While this all sounds negative, it is still a must read if you have already read the first book in the trilogy. It's a story that you just fall in love with and even though I didn't like the direction the book took, I still love the characters. I can't wait until the third book comes out and can complete the story.hird book comes out and can complete the story.
B00006LLLN|3.0|I absolutely love Alison Krauss's bluegrass music.  Unfortunately a lot of her music these days is not really bluegrass, but rather falls into an acoustic country ballad category. So this album and most of her recent albums are hit & miss for me.  If you love her ballads, you'll love this.  If you like the bluegrass - then you'll love those specific cuts, but wish there were more of them. This is a live concert CD, so expect to hear the crowd.  Great performance on all the cuts by top notch musicians.
B005O30Y5Y|3.0|This is one of my favorites of the Harry Potter films, but this review is not for the movie. This is for specifically the Movie-Only + UltraViolet Digital Copy.<br />Previously when I have purchased Blu-Ray discs with a digital copy included, it is for a download of the movie, which I can then load onto my iPod or watch from my computer. This digital copy was for a copy of the movie in Flixster.<br />You have to join Flixster, then you can add the digital copy to your account, then you can stream it from wherever you can log in to Flixster. I suppose this might be useful for someone who is bad at backing up their files, but I actually wanted to be able to download the movie and put the file on my iPod, and also back it up with the rest of my movies and music.
0345803485|1.0|I wish zero stars was an option. If you think you may be interested in this book then read the first three chapter sample from Amazon. You will see why many opted not to buy it in the end.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book in grade eight core english, and I can`t say how glad I am that it was in the curriculum. The Giver is a very good book about a society in which everything is controlled by the gover nment. Careers are picked for you, your spouse is picked for you, and your kids are picked for you. The book focuses on Jonas, an eleven year old kid about to recieve his career assignment and begin his training. The story that unfolds is very exciting and has many twists. The writing is great and the characters are interesting. One thing to note is that you should be prepared to deal with any immature people reading this book, as their is a small part talking about the feelings children recieve during puberty, and I definitely remember a lot of giggling during the class as we went over that. That doesn`t diminish from the story, but just beware. Also, there are some disturbing themes which might scare some people. All in all, the Giver is an amazingly great experience which is very well written and shows a neat reflection on society as it is. Make sure you don`t miss the sequels, Gathering Blue and The Messenger, which aren`t nearly as good, but are still enjoyable. A note to Lois Lowry: Please write another book in the series. In the rare case that Lois Lowry might actually read this, I hope she would listen and write at least two more of these amazing books. If you told me to rate The Giver out of 10 I would say 13
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My wife and I have been longtime Woody Allen fans.  We always preferred his zanier, early movies, like \\"Take the Money and Run,\\" \\"Play It Again, Sam,\\" \\"Sleeper,\\" and so on.  Truly, some of his more recent efforts have been disappointing, to say the least.  But \\"Midnight in Paris\\" far exceeded our expectations.<br /><br />We looked at some of the other reviews and can't see what commenters are talking about.  The movie is beautifully shot and directed.  Owen Wilson is simply terrific as Woody's alter ego, and the storyline is totally engaging.  Sure, it's a bit of science fiction, with characters moving back and forth in time.  But that's what makes it so creative and different as a Woody Allen film.<br /><br />Back on Owen Wilson, he is a revelation in his mannerisms and halting speech.  He must have studied Woody's other movies, at length, where he himself was the central character.  It truly is an amazing performance and one you won't forget, if you're a Woody Allen fan.<br /><br />The other actors do well, too, with this quirky, yet profound story.  Paris looks gorgeous throughout and, on its review, the chamber of commerce must have done cartwheels.  The music was fine, centering as it did on Cole Porter and similar pieces from the 1920's.<br /><br />Summing up, this is the Woody Allen film we've been waiting for for a long time.  It truly is a masterpiece and we can only hope there will be more like this from the master.  He's proven he doesn't need bathroom humor or stark, sexual references to make a movie.  Five stars and highly recommended.
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is a life changing book. Reading this book and taking in the messages has led me to evaluate my life in a less critical way. The messages have lead me to make positive changes, including an easy forgiveness for real and perceived hurts from others and even myself. I had a hard time putting it down until I was finished.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Solid story just for the romance between the two main characters but so much more with the two brothers, the mom, the poetry.  Absolutely loved it!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the books and was excited to hear that the book would be getting the Hollywood treatment. The movie stayed close to the plot of the book and even though the movie is about two and a half hours long, it still had to gloss over a few things. I would have loved to see more time spent on Lisbeth's first guardian, Holger Palmgren and more about Lisbeth's past. Much of the plot unfolds via the actions of the characters and there is little narration during a few crucial chapters so if you haven't read the books then you may miss a thing or two if you're not paying close attention.<br /><br />They really nailed the visual style, everything is as dark a dreary as I imagined!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this constantly. Its basic solitare draw one or draw three. I would definitely recommend.  Totally great deal at free!
0345803485|3.0|No vampires in this book,though. But same story line. Mysterious, sexy man entrances unlikely girl. Those close to her are unsure about this man.... Somewhat entertaining. I will buy the second book in the trilogy because it is a very easy read.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|I've only watched a couple of songs so far, but I watched the tour documentary all the way through. That, alone, is worth the price of the DVD. It's VERY well done. (Iron Maiden does a better job with each release. They give their fans their all!) Seeing how much ingenuity and hard work goes into pulling off their tours is intriguing, entertaining and inspiring. It seems like a wonderful \\"place\\" to work. And like the last DVD, it's amazing to see such a loyal fan base so many varied cultures. It's like The Amazing Race of heavy metal!<br /><br />I look forward to watching the concert, as what I saw so far was hard to stop watching (but I had work in the morning). The sound couldn't be any better. I think it's better than the last DVD, which wasn't anything to complain about. Bruce especially sounded great. And the picture and shots look stunning.<br /><br />It's not hard to see why this is a top seller.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|I really was contemplating giving this book five stars, but I just am not going to. I think it should be more of a 4.5. This book really makes you think about things and I believe had I read this when I was a teenager or even early 20s then I would have ended up giving it the full five stars, but I learned all of these lessons the hard way and it's just slightly depressing reading this book knowing that even those who read this will still make the same mistakes.<br /><br />This book is about a teenager who kills herself and she sends cassette tapes to each of the 13 people that she feels summed up the largest feelings that led to her decision to take her own life. This book shows the repercussions one action can make when combined with all of the other things going on in someones life. You may make fun of somebody one time and one time only, but it just so happen to be on a day where that person already had five other people do something to them.<br /><br />I literally cried, tears came out of my eyes and I had to blow my nose once. This one part of the book is just so damn touching and sad and emotional. The book is told from the viewpoint of Clay, one of the 13 reasons, as he is listening to the tapes for the first time. He is not on the first few tapes and it gets suspenseful for Clay as he is listening to all of the things that happen to Hannah waiting for his name to come up. It is suspenseful for us as readers too because Clay seems so emotional about what is happening on the tapes that as a reader we don't want him to be one of the reasons.<br /><br />Anywho, I recommend this book for everyone. Though you would need to be in the right mood. No romantic mood, or a mood where you just wanna lose yourself in a story. Remember, this is a story about suicide. And I still would recommend this to everyone
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Does anyone remember the Six Million Dollar Man? Apparently, if your under forty, you don't know who Steve Austin was.  The pop culture phenomenon of the 1970's was portrayed by former \\"Death Valley\\" star, Lee Majors.<br />Steve Austin, was a former test pilot and astronaut, who almost died tragically in a test flight gone wrong. He lost both his legs, eye and right arm in a tragic crash.<br /><br />However, the government rebuilt him with mechanical or \\"bionic\\" replacements.  After intense physical therapy he learned how to utilize his new limbs to work for the government again as an agent for the Organization of Scientific Intelligence or O.S.I.<br /><br />Purchasing the season one DVD set brought back a lot of memories. I discovered there were three TV movies before the ABC Network committed it to a series.  There were quite a few good seventies guest stars.  Farrah Fawcett, Lee Majors wife at the time, played the first female astronaut in one episode.  John Saxon played a robot replacement for an OSI agent. Gary Lockwood played an unscrupulous assassin.<br /><br />Little did I know that William Shatner was a character in the episode \\"Burning Bright\\".  He played a troubled man who was exposed to an unknown radiation that gave him extra sensory perception. He could stare at people and make them collapse by thinking about it.  It makes me think of that George Clooney movie \\"Men That Stare at Goats\\". For those of you who are a Shatner fans; he does his ham fisted acting routine.  He's channeling a  crazy version of Captain Kirk in an unintentionally funny episode.  His character meets a tragic demise when he climbs an electrical tower in an attempt to contact a friend who has long passed away.  From what we learn in the episode, he can talk to people in heaven and communicate with dolphins.  I do have vague memories of the episodes. They date back to 1973, so my recollection has faded.

B00007JVBI|2.0|Listening to \\"You Are Free\\" again today, 9 years after I purchased it, it occurred to me that this would qualify as a very bad album by Cat Power or by any other artist.  I loved both [[ASIN:B000009VOL Moon Pix]] and [[ASIN:B00004NHDY The Covers Record]] when they came out and they both sound fantastic more than a decade later, but \\"You Are Free\\" is a huge dropoff.  The first 2 tracks sound like bad outtakes and \\"Names\\", which should have been sub-titled \\"The Child Abuse Song\\", is just trite and awful.<br /><br />Chan Marshall had a great run and maybe she'll get it back.  Just don't start with this record, or you won't know why she mattered once.

B007MDB71O|4.0|One of our youth film critics reviewed this and here is what she had to say:<br /><br />From Disney's latest 250 million dollar film comes the exhilarating 3-D adventure of John Carter. This movie is based on the first out of eleventh novel of the series Princess of Mars, written about a century ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this film, John Carter is a Civil War veteran who finds a medallion that teleports him to Mars. There, he makes allies and foes with the aliens he encounters and falls in love with the princess of Helium. At the same time, massive war is occurring between the aliens so Mars is in a chaotic state, and there is also an antagonist who tries to use schemes to put Carter back on Earth. Can John Carter manage to stay with his princess despite these obstacles?<br /><br />Writer and director Andrew Stanton wrote the magnificent screenplays for Toy Story 1, 2, and 3, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo, but John Carter is not one of his best works. Some parts are not well rendered and a bit corny, but I did enjoy the ending of the film because it's interesting and unpredictable, and I am sure this movie will become very popular. I also liked the main theme of the movie regarding to cultural differences. The movie shows how different the norms and appearances are for aliens on Mars compared to people on Earth, yet it is universal for both life forms to have good intentions.<br /><br />The CGI animation is also impressive, for it details even on the smallest of aspects. Its vividness combined with the 3-D makes the movie pop to life, particularly during the action scenes. The CGI animation is very compatible with movies such as Avatar and Planet of the Apes. The cinematography is also beautiful since the landscape of the film is set in the desert, which makes the movie more interesting to me since I rarely see action scenes occur in such an isolated, dry, and hot place.<br /><br />As for the actors, all of them performed their roles well, but I think Taylor Kitsch was especially well suited to his heroic character John Carter.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to teens 13 and older because there are a few violent scenes. The movie is a great family film, especially for tweens and some teens. Overall, the movie is an entertaining cinematic experience. There are a myriad of action scenes and the entire film is in 3-D, which adds a lot of depth making the movie seem realistic. You will definitely be thrilled if you're into science fiction movies and video games. Reviewed by Gabriella C, KIDS FIRST!

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is probably the most compelling book I have read in a while! It draws you in right from the first couple pages. You really get to know Catniss and how she thinks. You get to see Petta and Catniss' relationship mature through the games and what happens after the games. Collins has a great imagination and really came up with a thrilling yet touching story! I recommend this book to everyone! Just be prepared to read all day! I can't wait to see the movie and start reading the second book!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The program is exactly as billed. It works very well, no glitches that I've seen, and the ads aren't presented in an annoying way. I especially like being able to store it on my phone's SD card. Highly recommended if you like playing solitaire.<br /><br />Edit: When I wrote this review, the program only popped up ads for the developer's other games. Now they not only have video ads, but ads that you can't back out of. To get out of them, I have to hit the phone's home screen button, since they don't even have a close button on these. This is a deal-breaker for me. Mobility Ware, fix your app!

0307956350|4.0|*This is an advanced readers copy*<br />Kate Moore is an expat mom living in Luxembourg when she realizes that there are secrets surrounding her daily life.  Hiding her own, possibly life threatening, secrets she easily recognizes those of others.  When it becomes apparent that her family is under the watchful eyes of those she considers friends she decides to get to the bottom of it.  What she discovers is a dangerous web of lies that could destroy the life she was trying to build with her family.<br />Kate was a likable protagonist and she was convincing as a wife a mother.  The plot is interesting and original in my experience with this genre.  I don't want to give too many negatives as the copy I read was not the final print, but I have a couple of complaints that may have been smoothed over.  It read slowly for me and it didn't grip my full attention.  The transition from past to present wasn't smooth and I had to go back and see which period I was reading numerous times.  Overall I liked it and I will be on the lookout for future work from this author.

044042321X|5.0|Game of Thrones makes a great graphic novel. I read the comic edition first and wasn't sure what to make of them. An introduction from George R.R. Martin helped me understand that the story had to follow the novel, not the show. I relaxed and enjoyed the book more. The story follows the Stark family of the North as drama envelopes their lives in intruige. In addition, a young girl whose family used to control the throne is coming of age and marries a great warlord. The story is based on the novel and there are differences from the Tv show. There are more flashbacks and dream sequences which fill in the blanks. It deepened my understanding of the story and I grew to really enjoy it.

0670023329|5.0|We think we have it bad sometimes, but even the worst lives in the US are better than those in NK.  To think that in the world today, there is places like Camp 14, filled with evil people who are driven by fear and hunger.  We argue over Organic food and if McDonald's is healthy or not.  They dream of fired meat and die over kernels of corn.  I often watch Google Maps and see the night images, and stare at the black hole that is NK.  I knew it was dark because they can't make enough electricity, but I didn't know that they keep it off so people can't watch smuggled soap operas and bootleg CD video.  When an electric rice cooker is a show of your wealth and status, it really drives home how poor and mistreated they are.  A must read.

B00006WKSZ|5.0|If you can find the original 2LP or 2CD, getem. UN-remastered, original recordings. These guys sound fantastic. Waaaaay better than anything they ever did after selling out in America. Lovedrive was good, Animal Magnetism was good. After that, they got worse. But up till Lovedrive, the Scorpions were incredible and this live release showcases several of their songs from their beginnings till (not including) Lovedrive. GET IT. It's excellent.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I picked up this book because the subject matter -- N. Korea -- interested me. What I discovered was a moving,  captivating, beautifully conceived and executed work. Exploring the layers of complexity was as pleasurable as getting to know the characters. Read this book!
B000063COX|4.0|I bought this album the first day it showed up in stores back when I was in Highschool. I knew this band would go places. Sad that Dianno departed after the Killers album (THE BEST MAIDEN ALBUM IMHO) but the next few Iron Maiden albums were not bad. I lost interest after Powerslave. The FIRST TWO MAIDEN albums are by far their best and most original. I'd say Number of the Beast is the best with Bruce on vocals. As for their debut, GET IT. Four stars all the way. FIVE STARS for their followup Killers.

B0015DROBO|2.0|I had been hesitant to read this popular, cult-followed work and after finally doing so, I am disappointed to say that I feel as if I wasted my time.<br />More focus was lent to developing the Vanger family [back] story, and descriptions of scenery, and unimportant details: (I could have made a drinking game out of every time a character ate a sandwich), rather than the actual story.<br />As others have already stated: this book should have retained its original title. This novel is less about 'the girl with the dragon tattoo', than anything else.<br />It remains a pretty basic crime thriller, focused on the sexual abuse and murder of women. What the main drive and purpose for writing this long story was, I still am not sure. I don't think I will read the following two novels.
0385504225|5.0|*********************************SPOILER ALERT********************SPOILER ALERT************************************<br /><br />  The readers of Dan Brown's series chronicling the adventures of Symbologist Robert Langdon have become accustomed to the complexly entertaining plotlines that are destined to ensue.  Although the plot has many twists and turns along the way, it is structured in a way that is easy to follow.  The protagonist, Langdon, a professor of Symbology at Harvard University who routinely is sought after for his expertise in the austere ultimately results in an exhilarating race against time to uncover some evil plan that is often solved within the last remaining minutes/seconds.  In this regard, The Lost Symbol is no let down.  The reader is immediately immersed with a sense of the mysterious, when Langdon receives a summons to lecture in Washington, D. C. that is accompanied by a request to bring with him a cryptic sealed package that he has been holding.  The basis of The Lost Symbol, is that of a \\"Hero's Journey\\" with many obstacles placed strategically along the way that provide the reader with an entertaining thrill ride to save the U. S. Government as we know it.<br /><br />  Armed with a desire for knowledge and an insatiable appetite for mystery, our Hero (Robert Langdon), is summoned to the Capitol supposedly by the head of the Smithsonian Institution (Peter Solomon), who happens to be a Mason as well as a longtime friend and mentor to him.  Along with this invitation, comes a request for Robert to bring a sealed package that he has been holding for him for some time.  It is learned that Solomon has been kidnapped and his hand removed as evidence of his capture by Mal'akh, and left within the Capitol building.  As with all kidnappings, the perpetrators demand a \\"ransom\\"; this is not a ransom of money, but of knowledge.  Knowledge of the \\"Lost Word\\", and the physical location of the rumored Manson's Pyramid, or his friend will be summarily executed, and a video depicting our nation's leaders engrossed in Masonic Rituals that some would find unsettling to say the least, that will be turned over to the media if he fails his mission.  With the aide of law enforcement, Langdon discovers a clue upon the examination of the evidence of life left by the kidnappers that ignites our quest for this lost knowledge.<br /><br />  Our Antagonist is a tattoo covered Freemason, who entered this brotherhood with the intention of obtaining an old source of power that they (Freemason's) hold near and dear.  After is failed attempts to do so, he forcefully persuades Langdon, who unwillingly acquiesces his request.  Mal'akh eventually captures our hero and severely injures one of the novel's heroines, both of whom escape through the daring rescue by the Law Enforcement Officers that have helped throughout the story.  Mal'akh, who was eventually successful (or so he thought) in his quest for the knowledge of the lost word, and the location of the Mason's Pyramid, reveals his true identity as the long believed dead Son of Peter Solomon.  Mal'akh demands that his father sacrifice him to aide him in the completion of his destiny, however he is killed when Law enforcement arrive at the temple, by shards of glass impaling him.<br /><br />  After the quest to save his friend is complete, Langdon is informed that the knowledge that Mal'akh (Zachary Solomon) had learned that day was a falsehood.  Robert then learns from his friend what the \\"word\\" actually is, and its relevance to the Mason's Pyramid.  Langdon unravels the final details of this mystery in a picturesque monument with a view of the Capital City, and is informed by Peter, that the rediscovery of the \\"word\\" will bring about a new age for humankind.<br />The Lost Symbol, is a superbly organized work that guides the reader through a classic progression of the archetypal \\"Hero's Journey\\"; Langdon reluctantly embarks on a journey to save his friend, is met with many, meets various helpers along the way, confronts the antagonist, and saves the day.  The locations that are contained within represent the journey to enlightenment; the first clue leads to a basement, and the story culminates high atop the city looking down and seeing the grander scheme behind its construction/layout/purpose.  With many steps along the way that work their way from the subterranean to the heavenly.  With important details, although alluded to throughout are obscured from the complete view of the reader until the appropriate time for their revelation.<br /><br />  For the money, you (in my opinion) will not find a better, more entertaining page turner that will both excite you and stimulate some interesting thoughts about how you perceive things that you once thought that you knew.

0345803485|5.0|I was hesitant to read this trilogy after reading some reviews but I am so glad I did! This was probably one of my favorite books I have read in a long time. The story is so easy to get wrapped up in. I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 books in a week. The sex scenes were not a graphic as I was imaging them to be.<br /><br />The characters brought out a lot of emotions in me. I would love Christian one minute then hate him the next. Ana, well she really made me mad at some points then I would feel sorry for her. However - I do have to say that I have a little crush on Christian. I know he is a ficticious character but man, his take control attitude and overprotectiveness was kinda hot. I definitely wouldn't mind being tangled in the sheets with him!
B0076D20E8|5.0|I really enjoyed the film and the concept about a royal actually writing all of Shakespeare's works...it's a fun film to watch!
B002ZG97LK|1.0|First off,  I have a couple disclaimers just to clear things up.<br />Number One--I grew up in the eighties and Footloose was one of my favorite movies it was right up there with Breakfast Club and Top Gun. But also realize I enjoyed motion pictures like Children of a Lesser God as well. With that said, I tried to go in to this movie with an open mind and unbiased in anyway, whether or not I was successful read on and decide for yourself.<br />Number Two--I am by no means an accomplished critic in anyway,  it's very hard for me to find a movie I don't take joy in watching. After all, I am a movie geek, love movies, and watch everything I can get my hands on from raucous comedies to critically acclaimed to foreign films, and even some anime and an emerging new genre like FFVII: Advent Children and others in this type of film medium. I do have a minor in film studies from Wichita State University, but these are my only credentials. With these things said, read further if you would like to know my opinion of the Footloose remake.<br /><br />In the \\"It's our Time\\" Footloose remake, it is far from its time because the hits are far outnumbered by the misses. I wish I could start and end on positive notes, there just wasn't much positive in this movie. I will cover the short list of hits in the movie first. If casting on looks alone were the only criteria for a good movie remake then this is a perfect movie all of the main characters seem to mimic the looks of the original cast; except for the changing of nationality of some of the characters, and Dennis Quaid doesn't resemble John Lithgow in any way.<br />I like the rewrites of the script where it concerns Ren's, aunt's husband. This was a nice attempt and a good hit. And the actor portraying him I believe gave one of the best, if not the best performance in the movie. I also like the reason Ren came to Bomont to live with his aunt, though it's true motives and potential falls way short, oh sorry, this is supposed to be the positives. The beginning and it's connecting parts throughout the film did its job in explaining the town a little, but not by much. The dance scenes were okay for the most part although most reminded me of the original more than being original themselves. Let's see, anything else...The actor playing Willard made me think of Sean Penn the whole time, nonetheless he did okay in his performance, as good as any of the other's except of course for the aunt's husband. Beyond these few things, there wasn't much else good about the movie.<br />And now for the misses, but there are so many, I do not know where to begin, so I will try and stick to fim criteria such as music, acting, script, and the like. First off, and I know this is my bias, the remakes of two of the more important songs in the movie were done horribly, not to mention leaving off the song from Ren's dance scene in the saw mill in the original; or if they used the same song it was done so horribly I didn't recognize it. Remaking a rock song into a ballad was the worst travasity I think. I could see changing it to a ballad if it was an emotional scene but it wasn't or if it was supposed to be, it fell short by far. And the remake of the love ballad at the end, it was so bad that I took the time to run to the restroom while it was playing. But I do apologize for being so harsh because I know music is subjective.<br />As for the acting and performances, as I said the only really memorable role was that of the aunt's husband. I saw very little chemistry between the Ren and Arielle character, but the friendship between Willard and Ren was done better I think, but this was by no means The actor who played Ren's doing, it was the actor playing Willard. Again Andie McDowell's role as Val Moore was given very little screen time at all, and this was probably the director's fault, I think Val should play a bigger role in the film. I say this mainly because one of the reason's I wanted to see it was because Dennis Quaid was cast as the Reverend. And I was very disappointed in his performance, in fact, it was subpar for any actor with his experience, but again this may not have been Mr. Quaid's fault. And it is hard to follow a performance like John Lithgow's was in the original film. Is there anything else about the acting??? Nothing that stands out.<br />The script...the main script was pretty much identical to the original, almost. The script tempted to add a few things and those things for the most part would have been excellent if they had been done properly. As I said in the positive's the relationship between Ren and his aunt's husband was a little better developed and I like the idea of him supporting instead of not as he did in the first one. I like the added dimension of why Ren ended up in Bomont, but it really was followed through haphazardly. Yes there was a lot of mention of it, but the actor portraying Ren didn't convey that much except for in the dance sequence in the abandoned building. The father-daughter relationship between Arielle and the reverend was done so much better in the original, and only one of the changes was a near hit, but ultimately failed because it lacked the emotion of the original. As I mentioned before Willard's and Ren's friendship was done better as well. I could pick this near exact cover of the script to death so I won't. I will just mention that the catch phrase for the movie and all over the poster's, `It's our Time', could have given this movie much more praise and power, but we never really see anything about it until the last few scenes of the movie. So don't let the phrase seduce you into watching the movie, because I believe you will be sorely disappointed. I would wait until it reaches DVD to watch it, but probably not even then. I was going to add it to my amazon wish list as soon as it was available. But now I don't think I will, and I feel it may well end up on the shelf way sooner than MTV wants it too.<br />In closing, if Ias a freelance writer were commissioned to do another remake of the motion picture Footloose, I would probably piece together the best parts of both scripts and focus a little more on the relationships of the characters and keep the original music the way it was. Then look to the stars in the midnight sky and hope I could find actors and actresses that could convey the best  performances of the two motion pictures combined...Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, Andie McDowell, and those actors playing Willard and the aunt's husband in the remake...and there could be the potential to leave a lasting impression like August Rush, Music & Lyrics, Save the Last Dance, and Top Gun.<br />Well I hope this helps those who were wavering on whether or not to go see the movie in their decision-making. For those who loved the movie, I am sorry if I offended you, but if you really look within and maybe even compare the old and new songs one after the other, then you may begin to understand why I only gave this remake one star.  Until my next review, do yourself a favor and go take in a motion picture this weekend and suspend your disbelief for a couple hours, it may change the world, but if not the world; at the very least, it may change you just a little bit.
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|The Byrds were on the threshold of a major upheaval when they entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood on June 21, 1967 with producer Gary Usher to record their fifth album. A few days before, at the Monterey Pop Festival, David Crosby (rhythm guitar) had alienated his bandmates with his controversial comments from the stage and by performing with Buffalo Springfield.<br /><br />During the sessions, the band recorded Triad, Crosby's homage to a menage a trois, but Roger McGuinn (lead guitar) and Chris Hillman (bass) felt the song was too controversial to include on the album. Tensions peaked when Crosby refused to participate in the recording of Goffin and King's Goin' Back, which was in direct competition with Triad, and which Crosby saw as an artistic regression in the same mold as My Back Pages on the Younger Than Yesterday album. Crosby was unceremoniously fired in October. He had always been difficult to work with and his material was becoming increasingly Top-40 unfriendly. Drummer Michael Clarke had left the Byrds of his own accord during recording, disillusioned with the direction the band was taking. With only a half an album of material in the can at that point, McGuinn, Hillman, and Usher fleshed out the balance of Notorious Byrd Brothers with amazing results. Former Byrd, Gene Clark, re-joined the Byrds for a short spell of three weeks during the recording but his contributions to the album are unclear.<br /><br />The Notorious Byrd Brothers was released on January 15, 1968 and reached to #47 on the U.S. album charts. The single, Goin' Back/Change Is Now, was released on October 20, 1967 and peaked at #89.<br /><br />Despite the acrimonious recording sessions, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, is widely acknowledged as one of the band's very finest albums. As in Younger Than Yesterday, the band explored the musical genres of folk rock, jazz, psychedelia, and country. Usher overlapped the songs in the same manner as the Beatles'  Sgt. Pepper, which gives the album a wonderful flow. Many noted session players were brought in to augment the sound including Clarence White, Red Rhodes, Jim Gordon and Hal Blaine. White's country guitar pickin' and Rhodes' pedal steel guitar are prominent throughout the album and give it a noticeable country flavor. The Notorious Byrd Brothers was one of the first rock albums to feature the Moog synthesizer thanks to McGuinn's fascination with technology. Usher relied heavily on studio experimentation to enhance the album's psychedelic feel.  At a total length of 28:28, The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the shortest album in the group's collection. The cover photograph, with Hillman, McGuinn, Clarke, and a horse peering through windows has been widely interpreted as the band's parting jab at Crosby.<br /><br />Over the years The Notorious Byrd Brothers has been held in high regard by critics and fans alike. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it as #171 on its \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list. If I were limited to being able to listen to only one Byrds album, this would be it. In a 2013 interview, McGuinn stated, \\"In spite of all the strife that was going on with Crosby and everything, (Notorious) might be my favourite (Byrds album), the way it blends in from one track to another, and it's got some sound effects in it. We kind of peaked at that point.\\"<br /><br />Side One:<br /><br />Artificial Energy (McGuinn, Hillman, Clarke) - Describes a trip on speed gone bad accompanied by brass. A very unusual Byrds song but enjoyable.<br /><br />Goin' Back (King, Goffin) - I share Crosby's disdain for the saccharine lyrics and romper room mood. Note the glockenspiel.<br /><br />Natural Harmony (Hillman) - Psychedelic rock at its very best. The studio effects are wonderful. Jim Gordon is a huge improvement over Clarke on drums. Groovy lyrics.<br /><br />Draft Morning (Crosby, Hillman, McGuinn) - Hillman and McGuinn reworked this poignant Crosby anti-war song after he was fired. Battle sounds were added bythe Firesign Theatre. Crosby was incensed that Hillman and McGuinn stold the song.<br /><br />Wasn't Born To Follow (King, Goffin) - Country meets acid. Was included as part of the soundtrack for the film, Easy Rider (1969).<br /><br />Get To You (McGuinn, Hillman) - McGuinn later claimed this tune was actually penned by Gene Clark and himself. Another psychedelic trip. Many listeners were unable to decipher the chorus, \\"Oh, that's a little better.\\" Hal Blaine expertly handles the drums. In an interview McGuinn said he wrote Get To You to prove to the departed Crosby that he was capable of writing a song with uneven jazz timing.<br /><br />Side Two:<br /><br />Change Is Now (Hillman, McGuinn) - A wonderful country/psychedelic tune. Usher puts together an otherworldly break featuring McGuinn's Rickenbacker. Blaine is solid on drums and Rhodes adds just enough steel.<br /><br />Old John Robertson (Hillman, McGuinn) - This song already saw the light of day as the B-side to Lady Friend but Usher added phasing to the orchestral bridge for this version. Clarence supplies plenty of expert country picking.<br /><br />Tribal Gathering (Crosby, Hillman) - A delightful, jazzy, Crosby composition about a hippie be-in. Jim Gordon is a remarkable contrast to Clarke on the drums.<br /><br />Dolphin's Smile (Crosby, Hillman, McGuinn) - A lovely, Crosby tune with McGuinn providing Dolphin-like sounds on his Rickenbacker. The ocean would be a reoccurring theme in Crosby's later work.<br /><br />Space Odyssey (McGuinn, Hippard) - McGuinn plays the Moog in this space shanty salute to Arthur C. Clarke's short story, The Sentinel, which Stanley Kubrick will later adapt in 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />1997 CD Reissue Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />Moog Raga (McGuinn) - Groovy, man.<br /><br />Bound To Fall (Brewer, Mastin) - Instrumental. Hillman will later bring this tune to Manassas.<br /><br />Triad (Crosby) - Crosby's jazzy paean to threesomes. Awesome. Crosby's voice never sounded better.<br /><br />Goin' Back (King, Goffin) - Alternate version. Crosby gave it a shot with this early take but subsequently drew a line in the sand.<br /><br />Draft Morning (Crosby, Hillman, McGuinn) - Alternate version.<br /><br />Universal Mind Decoder (Hillman, McGuinn) - Change Is Now instrumental followed by album radio advertisement and in-studio argument primarily between David Crosby and Michael Clarke during the recording of Dolphin's Smile.

B005LAIH5O|4.0|A lone hero and his flying steed soar above a field of battle where gods and men fight against monstrous foes, to face the lord of the titans.  Epic!  As a long time fan of classical Greek mythology, as well as the movies these myths have inspired over the years, I was absolutely spellbound by this excellent adventure which also went a long way in making up for the disappointment of the first film.<br /><br />Bare-bones synopsis:  Perseus must once again take up his sword and confront a growing evil. After assembling a team of warriors to aid in his quest, they set sail in search of the mysterious Cyclops Island to explore its hidden secrets which leads them on a journey into the underworld. All these events lead up to a final, colossal battle between the forces of good and evil.<br /><br />The characters:  Sam Worthington in the role of Perseus is very convincing as the reluctant demigod, and although this attitude was rather annoying in the first film, the beginning of Wrath gives us more insight into this character's motivations and his desire to lead a very simple life. This is a hero that definitely has no aspirations of fame or power, which I believe makes him the perfect choice for a savior, because he possesses the rare virtue of humility and embodies power under control. I must say I didn't find Liam Neeson very believable in the first film (yes I understand he's playing the king of the gods but Olivier pulled it off brilliantly) and thought it was another example of miscasting an overrated actor, but in Wrath he evokes more sympathy than he ever did for me in Star Wars, Kingdom of Heaven or even Schindler's List. The supporting role of Andromeda changes dramatically as she is essentially made the de facto ruler of Greece and the first line of defense against the impending threat and I thought she was much more believable as a female, heroic role than the demigod Io in the first film. The character Aganor (aka \\"the navigator\\") as a slightly reluctant, supporting heroic presence was smartly performed, with a very light sprinkle of comic relief. Also, Ralph Fiennes (aka lord voldemort) gave another good performance as the manipulative and vengeful Hades, albeit with limited screen time.<br /><br />Strengths & Weaknesses:  The biggest weakness of the first film is mitigated by Wrath, namely the anachronistic cynicism regarding the gods which is never adequately explained in Clash but becomes more palatable, simply because it's already established.  Character development...  not very evident but I believe that when you have a plot gleaned from classical mythology it sort of precludes the need for too much of this, and furthermore you're not going to get much anyway given the less than two hours run-time, specifically when you realize just how much has to be accomplished during that period (never felt two hours in a theater go so fast).  Also, I keep hearing comparisons being made between this movie and the original 80's Clash of the Titans and I can honestly say, having seen that one more times than I can count, that the quality of fantasy movies currently being produced are head and shoulders above what was being made during that decade.  Not to mention, that the original also had a few gratuitous nudie scenes (very common in the 80's) while Wrath contains absolutely none of that or even any foul language nor excessive violence for that matter; it's a pretty clean movie actually.<br /><br />Please note that I'm actually writing this review having watched the theatrical release and so I really recommend that you see this one in 3D because Movies like Wrath of the Titans are, I believe, what makes said technology worthwhile. The biggest attraction after all is visual; flawless blending of CGI with live-action, panoramic cinematography, meticulous authenticity of costumes from the heroic age of Greek mythology, wonderfully imaginative mythological creatures both frightening and convincing, and truly breath-taking action sequences.  We need more good fantasy adventures like this one, Thanks Warner Bros.  :o)uences.  We need more good fantasy adventures like this one, Thanks Warner Bros.  :o)
0307888908|5.0|I started to have a look at the \\"The Start-Up of You\\" book because I thought I will check what the co-founder of the popular linkedin.com has to say. I have to admit that I had a preconceived notion about what this book could be. I assumed that it will talk about general startup concepts and how a network, like linkedin, is important to this idea and then brag a little about linkedin. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The book opens with the very powerful line - \\"All human beings are entrepreneurs. When we were in caves, we were all self-employed...That's where human history began. As civilization came, we suppressed it. We became \\"labor\\" because they stamped us \\"You are labor\\". We forgot that we are entrepreneurs.\\" and this line stayed with me. And every chapter in this book brings up such powerful lines and ideas and I couldn't drop the book!<br /><br />The book is divided into following seven chapters and the chapters are small (30 pages on average) and not at all boring -<br />1. All humans are entrepreneurs<br />2. Develop a competitive advantage<br />3. Plan to adapt<br />4. It takes a network<br />5. Pursue breakout opportunities<br />6. Take intelligent risks<br />7. Who you know is what you know<br /><br />The book looks at the situation of the current job market in light of the globalization trend and technological advancements. It predicts how workers in the developed countries will compete with the global workers for the low skill jobs and then how to think differently. Each of the chapters contains a crisp idea and talks about how to relook at the problem at hand from a different perspective. It looks at the job/career growth problem from an economic perspective and predicts the situation from a historical reference. Finally, it lays down a set of very practical ideas to understand the madness, ways to handle the future market trends and discusses few methods to try out in the difficult situation. The book very well emphasizes on bias for action and encourages taking short iterative risks. The authors have observed how stellar performers approaches the career decisions and shared their hypothesis.<br /><br />I have seldom came across such good business book, which I would like to read as quickly as I can yet think through every paragraphs to realize the prudence of the ideas. I went back and bookmarked sections, underlined powerful thought-provoking lines just to ponder over the strong ideas and to self-realize again and again. In a nutshell, don't miss this book if you want to realize where you are heading in your career and to learn some practical tips on how to reach to your destination.n and encourages taking short iterative risks.

I admit it is really a great Soap Opera, but it's British so that makes it classical enough for Masterpiece Theater ;)
B001FB0WBK|3.0|I use a \\"youtube downloader\\" to download any video that I like and convert it to Windows Media, in this case many Tommy Emmanuel selections, so I am very familiar with his work and his talent just amazes me.  I had never heard him on DVD and I read all the reviews so I ordered it with two day shipping.  I am really disappointed!  The youtube videos that I have collected are BETTER than this DVD.  The sound on the DVD is \\"dead\\" compared to the youtube selections.  Now, if anything, the DVD sound should be better!  The interaction with the audience is almost nothing compared to youtube videos.  Tommy is not himself.  And that fellow with the mouth harp!  One of my favorite selections on youtube is Amazing Grace. You have to see Tommy do it in Seoul 2009.  I wanted to see Tommy repeat the Seoul performance, but along comes the harmonica player, sure he is good, but he ruined Tommy's performance.  You will have to see the original 2009 Seoul video to see what I mean.  I was so upset that I threw the DVD in the trash and went back and spent the next hour listening to the collection that I made for myself from youtube downloads.  I should put my collection up for sale because it is much better, but I can't do that...at least I have it to listen to and be inspired to play the guitar.  It's a dirty shame that the DVD is mediocre at best when compared with what I gleaned from the Net.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Great, great film. Don't be thrown by the bad reviews (not that there are that many of them). I could lay down the premise, plot, etc., but it's already been done quite well by the other reviewers. If you like thrillers that both mentally stimulate and challenge you, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|Reading the second novel by E. L. James continues the developing sexual experiences of both man and woman, who find the truth in sexual growth. Many intellectual books about sex leave out so many questions people have, many of them women, now answer those questions about how people experience feelings during this growing period of our lives. Usually in our sexual education, it's about the clinical aspects of sex and do not deal with feelings. I guess that's the puritanical history of not \\"talking\\" about sex. Anyone who needs to know about sex between a real man and woman will enjoy reading a real love story for once, and not feel guilty about \\"talking\\" about it. Thanks to E.L. James for providing it to us all.

No phony reality program or inferences that one has to place in the garbage bin or porno junk. Any woman who has experienced a real love in her life will understand the wonderful sexual growth of two loving people. Hooray for E.L. James for writing a beautiful novel that gives women who do not enjoy a sexual marriage, the chance to experience it in a book. Kudos to her and all the real women in this world who read this novel.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A centuries old disagreement, two very different techniques of magic, two students matched against each other to prove who's the best, and one magical venue that will transform them and the world. The Night Circus will take you on an incredible ride as Celia and Marco try to outdo each other, performing greater and greater feats of magic. As time passes and they build, enhance, and collaborate on the circus, they'll forget they're meant to be rivals. But falling in love was never part of the plan and the battle cannot be ignored. Outside forces and magic will begin to tear them and the circus apart. In a battle that can only have one winner, who will survive in the end?<br /><br />There can only be two words that describe The Night Circus; magical and epic. The story sets not a slow, but a steady pace. Like a gentle walk through the magical story of the circus and of the two young magicians. It's also a story that spans 30 years, from 1873 to 1903, so there's a lot that happens. And I mean, A LOT.<br /><br />As I read the book I couldn't help comparing it to a clock. Each gear moving another who in turn moves another. There are three time lines going on; the present in which you (the reader) are going through the many tents in the circus, the near past with a boy called Bailey who falls in love with the circus, and the far past with the magicians, their challenge, and the circus. It can be a little confusing at first, but once you get this timeline in your head you'll understand and it'll be magical.<br /><br />It all starts with the bringing up of Celia Bowen and Marco Alisdair, our two magicians. Their lives are very different. Celia's father is extremely hard on her, to the point of cruelty. He abuses her letting her go half starved, and breaking her body so she can practice healing. Marco has it easier, though his guardian mostly ignores him, leaving him alone for long periods of time. They're also brought up practicing very different sides of magic; one who excels at physical manipulation (transfiguration) while the other excels in perfect illusions and spells. We then jump to the creation of the circus, as it is an integral part of the challenge set to them. A challenge which 'starts' on opening night at Le Cirque des Rêves.<br /><br />After that the story only gets better and better as Celia and Marco get to know each other. Their romance just tugs at the tender parts of my heart because their love is something that grows and maintains through the years even though they know its forbidden. Marco is so direct and open with his feelings when they're together. He just came up with the most perfect lines to say, making me swoon in delight. He's so not afraid to love her, the way she is afraid of loving him.<br /><br />  \\"Everything I have done, every change I have made to that circus, ever impossible feat and astounding sight, I have done for her.\\"<br /><br />The different tents they create are just amazing. The Cloud Maze is probably my favorite tent of the circus, followed by the Ice Garden, and the Tree of Wishes. I kept zoning out trying to imagine if a real circus could somehow replicate that, and if such circus was created would I be able to join. I am that in love with this!<br /><br />There are really so many great things in this book. It's like it is The Night Circus and every chapter is a new tent with incredible secrets to discover as we read. As fan of series I thought I would be angry or sad or disappointed at the ending, since it's a standalone novel. But as I read those final chapters I could only smile. Smile at the memory of all that had happened since I read the words \\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" Smile because I know that I'll keep coming back again and again to read it.els at physical manipulation (transfiguration) while the other excels in perfect illusions and spells.

0312641893|5.0|An exciting debut by Marissa Meyer, Cinder will leave you enchanted with its very original retelling of the Cinderella fairy tale. Set in a futuristic world where decease is decimating a nation and an evil ruler from another planet is trying to rule the Earth, you'll soon be lost in the adventure, the mystery, and the romance.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg and the most gifted mechanic in New Beijing. With a wicked stepmother and two step sisters, one of which hates her guts, Cinder dreams of leaving her current life and starting anew. But then the handsome Prince Kai stops by her booth with an android to fix, she'll soon find herself entangled in political plots, an impossible crush with the next emperor, and the mystery that is her past.<br /><br />I was blown over by this story! With an amazingly built world, and a plot full of intrigue I couldn't stop reading! What I liked the most was the romance because Cinder does not simply fall swooning at the Prince's feet like in all the princess fairy tales. I loved that they get to know each other before the ball, and we get to see them joke around and slowly fall in love with each other. Even then poor Kai is rejected time and time again by stubborn Cinder. The secondary characters were just fabulous; they gave the story even more life. My favorites were Iko, Cinder's trusty android, and Dr. Erland, the nutty doctor playing the part of fairy godmother. And was that another princess I saw mentioned there?<br /><br />I'm very excited for this novel as it is part of a four book series! Yes, you heard me, a series! So be ready to dash to the nearest bookstore on January 3rd because you won't want to miss this release. This is Cinderella done right for young adults and adults alike!

B001HN6EF4|2.0|After much time trying to use these cards because they are plastic and more durable, I've gone back to buying paper Uno cards and have tossed these.<br /><br />The problems are many:<br /><br />1. The plastic carabiner is useless.  As I said in my original review, just toss it, it's useless.  You can get something better (other reviewers are recommending Nite-Ize products, and so would I if I felt these were worth it!)<br /><br />2. The holes in the car tend to deform with time.  They catch when shuffling even when new, but after a bit of time and some not so heavy abuse carrying them by the aforementioned S-biner, the plastic tends to bend and deform a bit.  This is just going to happen, and there's nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />3. Shuffling the cards.  Uno and other double and triple deck games are more difficult to shuffle than a standard poker deck.  That \\"Bicycle deck\\" texture that makes cards slide together without being slippery cannot be had on any Uno card deck obviously, but these cards are just slippery unless wet, in which case they kind of stick together until dry.  Neither makes for great fun playing cards near the water (as the theme suggests).<br /><br />6. SHARP EDGES.  I saw some complaints about this and dismissed them.  The cards don't seem overly sharp to me...  Or do they?  I've managed to get myself a couple of really nasty \\"paper cuts\\" with these non-paper cards, usually when trying to shuffle them.  This isn't a flaw in using plastic cards in general, because I have since played with some quality plastic cards.  If you're looking for quality plastic cards, obviously these aren't them just based on the price.<br /><br />Stick to paper cards, unless a licensee ever comes up with something better made than this.he result isn't waterproof.<br /><br />If you don't use the silly included plastic carabiner, these plastic UNO cards will last you many years of play, even with heavy use, as my UNO Splash cards did and as I expect my UNO H2O To Go cards will now.  (Now can we have Phase 10 similarly made of plastic please?)

B005IQZB14|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is a celebration of the trials and tribulations of embarking on a journey to discover who you are in your soul, what you are capable of enduring, and to learn you can survive alone, without a living breathing mother to guide you, if you remain alert to the gifts and help the universe offers in whatever form such aid might appear, and select judiciously, as Strayed does, only those that are most necessary and that set you free.<br /><br />The memoir is gritty, unselfconscious, and brutally honest, revealing even \\"shameful\\" aspects of the author's psyche and behavior. Though some readers state that they wish the author had kept those details to herself, their inclusion makes the reader's experience of Strayed's perseverance, her suffering, and ultimate transformation that much more savory.
B00466HN6S|3.0|Easter Island is the home of the facility that produces all the candy for the Easter holiday and it is managed by the current Easter bunny in charge.  It is a tradition going back over 4,000 years (Apparently Easter has nothing to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ). The Easter bunny's son is named EB and he is the heir apparent to become the next Easter bunny.  Unfortunately EB wants to be a drummer rock star and he has no interest in being the Easter bunny.<br /><br />This brings in Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) who is a loser son in a family of motivated people.  Fred can't even hold a job, or find one, while his family thrives on being somewhat successful.  EB and Fred cross paths and the fun begins as EB tries to fulfill his dream of being a drummer and Fred discovers that he wants to be the Easter bunny.<br /><br />This movie features marvelous animation and it really is spectacular. The computer generated graphics and color are just perfect.  The views of the candy production area under Easter Island are well done and the jelly bean waterfalls are like a natural beauty.  Unfortunately the acting is simply over the top and overdone to the point of being fake. Fred O'Hare's (James Marsden) role is simply the village idiot and the acting role is so unrealistic is really was not even fun for me to watch.<br /><br />My grandson loved the movie but my wife and I felt it was only average.  It is sad too that this movie has such great computer animation and the combination of the animation into the real world video is perfectly done. The acting is below average for the main character and the storyline for the humans is so very weak that it actually detracts from the movies value.<br /><br />Call me old fashion, but was it really worth saying that Easter has been celebrated for over 4,000 years which leads one to assume that it is in no way related with the resurrection of Jesus?  This one line statement was totally out of context and frankly I didn't appreciate it being stated.t being stated.
0345803485|3.0|This book is not well written; it's mechanical, with at least a handful of punctuation/editing errors.  Even so, it is compulsively readable.  I found myself reading more in spite of the insipid prose.  And not just because it is a touch racy.  In both her writing and her storyline, the author very nicely creates and leverages a sense of anticipation - that sooner or later you expect to see fulfilled.  For me it wasn't, so I am in no rush to go buy the second installment.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I seriously use this almost every day for work. It works super smoothly and it helps me be more efficient. I don't know what I would do without it now! Totally worth the buy!
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I really really wanted to like this series, and in fairness it has its enjoyable moments.  But those moments are done in by the excessive CGI use, bad dialogue/writing, and poor acting.<br /><br />Stylized violence is a good thing in movies, and we expect it...to a degree.  But in Spartacus, the CGI effects are so over the top, they end up detracting from the movie.  Anybody who has an interest in this series should be aware of -- and desire to see -- graphic, gory depictions of violence.  But when a Gladiator is cut in the shoulder in an otherwise well choreographed fight scene, it completely ruins it to see a ridiculously absurd amount of blood (sometimes we're talking GALLONS here) shooting 10 feet into the air or half way across the colliseum.  We actually started laughing during some of the fight scenes because the depiction of blood was so over the top.<br /><br />Many here have made the comparison to the style and cinematography in the film \\"300,\\" and that's accurate.  But remember that \\"300\\" started as a graphic novel (i.e., a comic book).  If I had wanted to see a cartoon, I would have joined the kids on Saturday morning in front of the television.  But those expecting something along the lines of HBO's \\"Rome\\" (another comparison cited in reviews, but with which I disagree), will be severely disappointed.<br /><br />The cast is mixed.  The lead, Andy Whitfield, is certainly the best and the loss of this talented actor with great potential is a real tragedy.  Most of the rest of the cast was weak, often engaging in painful to watch over-acting -- but again, if you view this as a cartoon, that might be appropriate. Maybe the director even told the actors to be over the top?  Regardless of the relative abilities of the different actors, they are often done in by some incredibly bad writing.  We often found ourselves groaning or mocking some of the cheesy lines uttered by the cast.<br /><br />And we will forever be tormented by our inability to erase from our minds the grating sound of John Hannah belowing in his Scottish accent over and over and over again \\"THE HOUSE OF BAAAAH-TEEE-AAAH-TUS!\\"  \\"House of Baaaah-teee-aaaah-tus, this,\\"  \\"House of Baaaah-teee-aaah-tus,that,\\" \\"blah blah blah, House of Baaaah-teeeeeee-aaaaah-tus,\\"  and on and on and on and on again and again and again in every episode.  At first it was amusing, as we started mimicking it ourselves.  After a few episodes of this, however, it became absolute torture akin to what some of the disobedient gladiators suffered.  \\"Baaaaaaaahhhh-teeeeeee-aaaaah-tus!\\"<br /><br />Again, in fairness, this series has its moments and can be entertaining at times.  But expectations going in should be realistic.  Those expecting and hoping for something to fill their Roman-era thirst left by the premature cancellation of HBO's \\"Rome\\" after two seasons will be disappointed.<br />Think \\"Young Guns II\\" vs. \\"Unforgiven.\\"  Both fun, enjoyable Westerns, but very very different movies.<br /><br />\\"Baaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh-Teeeeeeee-aaaaaaaah-Tus!!!\\"
0061474355|2.0|I'd heard good things about this book and being a fan of the fantasy genre decided to give it a go. I found it engaging at first, but then the book seemed to devolve into a too-hurried series of near calamities. I was expecting the pace to slow for a bit and for the reader to be given some background, but so far it hasn't happened. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I gave up about half way through, though I'm tempted to finish because some readers have said the second book is much better.<br />My main problem is I feel the author failed to give the reader a context for his fantasy realm. I've read enough in this genre I can make some guesses, but I feel like I really don't understand the world and how it works. For example, what is the \\"Charter,\\" what is \\"Free Magic,\\" etc? Without a big of background, I find it difficult to become engaged in the story.<br />Obviously, many, actually most, people really enjoyed the story. But I give an author until the midway point to really grab my attention, and it never happened with this book.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Okay, so the film doesn't take place in Hollywood but it does tell the story of a young man's time with an icon who was unmistakably Hollywood: Ms. Marilyn Monroe. This is an interesting film that is elevated by the fact that it is not another paint-by-numbers biopic but a film focusing on a relatively unknown protagonist whose biggest achievement is writing the novel upon which this film is based. And rather than covering his lifetime (or Marilyn's, for that matter), it encapsulates only the brief period of time in which Marilyn flew to England to star in actor/director Sir Laurence Olivier's \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" (during the prime of her career). The film's aim is to let us inside the mind of one of the most compelling and mysterious figures in showbiz history. This is not easy but the movie is incredibly effective by doing just that. We learn just how talented she could be onscreen when she put her mind to it and how maddening it could be attempt to capture that talent on celluloid. We are keyed in to her many quirks and numerous problems in her personal life.<br /><br />While Michelle Williams is never really able to disappear into the role of Monroe the way that Foxx captured Ray Charles or Blanchett nailed down Hepburn, asking her to do so would be a virtually impossible task. The performance she captures, however, was well worth the Oscar nomination she received. Kenneth Branaugh, playing his own idol Laurence Olivier, is absolutely brilliant & hilarious with many scene-stealing moments. Model-turned-actor Eddie Redmayne as our young protagonist is more than serviceable and this is the type of role that leads to bigger ones down the road. The authenticity of this film is what makes it what it is. And the fact that the quality of the film as a whole manages to exceed the performance of the extremely talented Williams speaks volumes about its script, direction and supporting cast. This one comes highly recommended.

I would like to say, \\" Thanks for your patriotic devotion to this great nation of ours!\\" When I met Marcus, I was in awe. I couldn't think of anything to say besides, \\"What a great book!\\" What a stupid thing to say to the author. I had to catch up to Marcus again and apologize for my reaction when we met. I took that time to tell him ,\\"Thank you. Thank you , not for the book but for the dedication to preserving our way of life. The way of life we take advantage of.\\"<br />  These young men, Chris Kyle and Marcus Latrell, have devoted their lives to defending our nation.<br />  How dare any of the comments on this book be anything but 5 stars! There are those that read these action books wanting to see a wreck in the car race or a kid get stomped in a bull riding event. Chris has allowed us to view a bit of his life that is not very easy for him to talk about. I am so thankful that we have young men like Chris and Marcus fighting for the way of life we enjoy, here in America.<br />  Thank you Chris for the very candid sharing of your time of deployment and the sharing the strength of your relationship with Taya. I appreciate you allowing her to put her comments in the book. Most of us just think when you return home from your deployment, you just live happily ever after. By sharing what you and Taya have shared...... you guys may save some marriages. There are an untold number of thankful parents and spouses that... because of the shots you took their sons, daughters and their spouses live today.<br />  Thanks for the strength it took to sit down and put your memories on paper. It is a book/memory I will never forget.
0553801473|4.0|This book seems to have pissed off a lot of Martin's fans, but I loved it. I love these characters, the new ones, the old ones, the ones that suddenly reappear from the earlier novels (it rhymes with geek!) This wasn't as exciting as the first three, until the last 200-300 pages, but the world he lays out is so much bigger now. What he was trying to do with this was incredibly ambitious. 90% of the time, he succeeds.<br /><br />My prediction - after he finishes the next two or so (and based on the last third of ADWG, those are going to be some of the best in the series) the 4th and 5th books will have a lot higher respect because of how they enriched the series.<br /><br />------<br />EDIT: Here's more on why I mostly liked this book (VAST SPOILERS)<br /><br />Dany - one of my favorite characters in the series - her chapters were the hardest for me to like. She makes terrible decisions in this book that we're forced to slog through. Chaining up the dragons pays off in the end (for the reader), but the marriage decision...ugh! I can understand what Martin was doing. She's a teenager making poor choices, as she has in the past, and it took a number of chapters to make those events believable. I guess it makes sense - from her perspective, she has no idea what's happening in the world around her, and she's about to get obliterated by a number of armies heading to Meereen, but I wanted the sly, surprising, vindictive Dany of the first three novels instead of this. However...I thought where he left her at the end was brilliant, and the dragons unleashed were superb.<br /><br />Tyrion - I enjoyed his chapters, although I can see why some would not. He's not a good person in his book, as much as he was in the previous ones.  But I give him some slack here because he's outcast, left with nothing, hunted and hated. He's perceived as an ugly scarred monster, and his behavior feels real. He's self destructive and depressed. His story did seem to drag in parts, though.<br /><br/>Jon - Sadly boring as commander of the watch, but the chapters are succinct. Knowing the ending, I'm looking forward to rereading his chapters. I DO NOT think he's dead, but that would be an interesting twist.<br /><br />Bran and Rickon - I love this story arch. I wish Martin had spent a lot more time with this instead of some of the other characters. The walkers coming out from under the snow was one of my favorite parts in the book, and finding the children of the forest.<br /><br />Quentyn - my favorite new character. His demise was pitch perfect.<br /><br />Arya - I enjoyed her becoming a secret ninja assassin.<br /><br />Theon - This is why I love Martin so much. Somehow, unexpectedly, Theon has become one of my favorite characters, and his sister too.<br /><br />All in all, with flaws and some dry stretches, this book still has enough great things going on to warrant 4 stars. Books 2 and 3 were 5+++ stars for me. In fact, they are the best books I've read in years. This one could have been as good. It was disappointing in parts, exhilarating in others. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he's going to knock our socks off with the next books. The story has been gestating in his head for 20 years, and around the last third of ADWD, it really started to pick up again. You could tell he's excited by where this is going. The dragons are terrifying now that they're grown, the characters are evolving, and he's been saving spider-riding white walkers for about 5000 pages now. My hopes are high.

I most recently have been using reading plans and when I don't get to read first thing in the morning, I love the convenience of having my verses an arm's reach away and can read as soon as I have a free moment.  An app that is making your time with God become a true habit so you can continue to grow your relationship with Him, His word and prayer.

0007345623|4.0|Lindsey Kelk's books have quickly become my guilty pleasures, her books just like Meg Cabot's and Sophie Kinsella's I know I can turn to when I need a quick pick me up; they easily bring a smile to my face and they're the perfect comfort reads. I've been glued to Angela's adventures ever since she ran away from London 18 months ago in I Heart New York. Each time I'm about to start a new book there's always a nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach, worried about what she will get up to this time. You always kind of know Angela's going to mess something up somehow or cause some sort of controversy, but then there's always the fun and laughter along the way which makes up for Angela being a total nutter. (A good nutter!)<br /><br />I Heart Vegas kicks off with Angela receiving a letter from the immigration and naturalisation service's revoking her visa; she has 30 days to obtain another visa and if she doesn't she will be forced to leave the country. So who does Angela turn to in her times of need? Her best friend Jenny Lopez, Jenny can't believe that Angela has over looked the easiest possible way of staying in America just marry her boyfriend Alex of course! But Angela's not too sure, as she doesn't want to marry Alex because it's a convenience but because they love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together. So she has 30 days to hatch a plan to get any of the other visa's possible otherwise her big American's dream over, her relationship with Alex will be over and she will be forced to leave America, which has become her home for the last year and a half and go back to her old life with her mum constantly fussing over her.<br /><br />I've always had a topsy turvy relationship with this series. I didn't really enjoy the first book; I Heart New York but decided to soldier along, the second book I Heart Hollywood was amazing and I thought if the series continued this way; this would probably end up being one of my favourite series. But then came along I Heart Paris which sadly wasn't all that either. I was definitely considering giving up this series but decided to give it one more shot, and I'm glad I did because I Heart Vegas has to be my favourite book of the series so far. It was fun, full of an impromptu visit to Vegas, scandalous goings on, about misjudging people and Angela royally messing up as usual, but I never laughed so much in a long time!<br /><br />\\"I knew he wanted me with<br />him - he'd said it over and over - but there was no<br />mention of making it official. We shared an apartment.<br />we shared a love of pineapple on pizza. We shared a<br />razor, even though he didn't know that\\"<br /><br />The only thing that miffed me was Angela's communication problems, it took forever for Angela to tell Alex about her situation, I found myself constantly wanting to throttle her to get her act together.<br />This book was also full of the clichedness you would expect. At first it was a little unbearable, but then as you got more engrossed with the plot, you kind of get used to overlooking it. Also there was some predictability to the plot, for instance you could guess what would happen at the end, but then there were other aspects which caught me completely by surprise and so sort of made up for the predictableness side of things.<br /><br />I Heart Vegas was just the sort of book I needed, after finishing a couple of intense books. It was a light, easy going, funny read. I hadn't realised how much I missed Angela and Jenny's adventures until I picked up this book. I look forward to more of Angela's Shenanigans in I Heart London.<br /><br />Favourite quote:<br /><br />\\"All I could think about was weddings. A<br />trip around the supermarket turned into a trial for<br />the aisle. Every song on my iPod was a contender<br />for the first dance. Every time Alex reached into his<br />coat pocket, my heart stopped - phone or ring? Phone<br />or ring? Quite often it was chap stick what a girl.\\"
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I purchased Wrecking Ball hoping to hear another great record from a great artist.  Unfortunately, I'm just not feeling it from this release.  I had hoped that Wrecking Ball would be closer to the upbeat style of Magic rather than the style of Working on a Dream, which seemed more subdued.  While Springsteen's words are close to the heart and soul searching, the tempo of the album just doesn't  lend itself to a press of the repeat button.
B006S08RLU|5.0|[[ASIN:B004ZG5EYC Am&eacute;lie [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I recently upgraded my 2-disk DVD version of this awesome film to the BluRay version and have loved the picture & sound quality so far. A definite improvement in both.  I do regret not having that wonderful album-art that was on the DVD version - almost felt like a surprise Christmas gift everytime I pulled it out.<br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend this version as it still contains all the special features that were on the DVD version.<br />AMELIE was a ground-breaking creation when it was released and continues to be a very iconic and a lovable film, not the least because of its dream-like coloring and ofcourse the gorgeous Audrey Tatou. Enjoy.

B005SZAEYO|5.0|The acting in this show is the catalyst that draws you in. The  bizarre, over the  top scenes are somehow mixed with enough realism through the characters that the preposterous blends  with the pedestrian. A Stephen Kinglike experience of accepting the unbelievable because those living it are so convincingly people we know that we become  grounded. One horror after another. Fascinating little vignettes of evil and we just can't look away. Well apparently \\"we\\" means me because plenty of reviews here have no use for it. I can't look away...

B007MG360G|3.0|This game is actually pretty fun to play. I don't know why people said that you can't make flying animals because you can too! The only problem is that somewhere in the time that you are playing the game freezes and you have to shut down your kindle. It is fun but probably not worth $1.99. I would recommend this to someone who asks about it but I would say beware of what it does sometimes.

0553801473|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it is right on par with A Storm of Swords in quality for me.  George RR Martin hasn't lost a beat.  I think some people get infuriated when things don't go their way, how a typical story arc would go in situations and the fact George doesn't give that to you irks them somehow.  I don't know.  There's 2 more books expected, and the battles Winds of Winter start with have potential to be the most epic in the entire series.  I love where George has taken all the characters, they're as real as ever.  I cannot wait until Winds of Winter comes out!  If you haven't, read The Hedge Knight.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is an amazing series, I couldn't get enough!!  I just finished the series and I think I'm going to start all over and read it again.

The way it is packaged for presentation is what caught my eye.  Any serious collector of Michael Jackson memorabilia certainly has to have this in his collection.  I only wish I could find the lp with this setup, then I would certainly be in second heaven.  Perfect addition. Perfect fit.  Beautiful.
B002BEXF5A|4.0|This \\"collectors edition\\" may not be essential, but as a long time fan I enjoy it mostly for historic value, and the inclusion of the two additional concert tracks. Is it worth the extra bucks? If you like [[ASIN:B000003S0W 801 Live]] maybe not, if you love it and have some extra bucks, sure, definitely.<br /><br />If you're even looking at this page, then you probably know 801 Live is one of the greatest live rock'n-roll albums of all time. This top quality reissue gives you 2 discs, with an extra two tracks from the legendary Sept 3rd 1976 concert included on the first (both are nice to have included, with Golden Hours especially good, and the version of Fat Lady Of Limbourg just okay, but also shows the original is just fine without them). The second disc is a complete rehearsal session from August 23. It is great for several reasons; 1) that they came so far in just 10 days (with 2 other live performances between), 2) that the 19 year old Simon Phillips is such an extraordinary drummer, 3) that they kept the same order and structure in the concert (showing remarkably little spontaneity), and 4) that what got captured on September 3rd is so amazingly good - in terms of performance and sound quality.<br /><br />But what makes this second disc so special is it's like sitting in on a rehearsal of a REALLY good garage band! It takes away some of the mystique of the 801 guys, but ironically makes the recording captured on disc 1 all the more remarkable. As well, we get 56 pages of excellent \\"liner notes\\" in a small sturdy hardback book format - comments from the band members, memorabilia (lyrics and recording notes), photos and reviews.<br /><br />Eno was right, 801 IS the central shaft (whatever that means...), and 35+ years later it still seems timeless. (And, by the way, Manzanera recalls in the notes how being so young made them have the gall to attempt the Beatles' TNK, but they absolutely nailed it, and I can't imagine a better, more definitive cover.)
1401937519|5.0|I heard about this young woman's story while watching a Wayne Dyer program on my PBS station.  It moved me. She appeared in person and spoke of her experiences.  There seemed to be a glow about her, a knowing. When I got her book and read it, it impacted my life and reaffirmed to me that dying is nothing to fear.  We all have appointments with death and to hear of the beautiful solitude and peace this woman experienced as she was entering into its realm only serves to lessen any fear I might have harboured inside.  Every one should read this book.  If you have a life threatening illness or have a loved one who is going through or who has gone through, this book will calm your heart and lift your spirit.  God Bless Mrs. Moorjani. Angels amongst us.  She is one!  And God wasn't ready for her yet.  She still had work to do and is doing it well.
B0073XORCY|4.0|When I'd first heard this was in the works, two thoughts came to mind...<br /><br />First, TAAB didn't truly catch on with me 'til after many (many, MANY) listens, which is not a courtesy I extend to every band. Virtuosic playing offset by a spotty, self-indulgent and overwrought (or, over-written?) concept. I could say the same of its kinda-sorta follow-up, A Passion Play, which revenue-wise sank like a millstone. (\\"The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\"? Indeed.)<br /><br />Second, let's face it, Things Change in two score years. (Where were you then? WERE you then?) Never mind the band's makeup or Ian's voice, the recording technology available today makes it easier to go from concept to...revision...revision...revision...and you just know artists want things. Just. Right.<br /><br />So, I resolved to listen to TAAB2, not try to compare it to TAAB, and definitely not try to parse it into discrete components. Yes, I even ignored TAAB2's track listings and resisted the urge to visit the St Cleve Website.<br /><br />I liked it. I'll just add that you're in for both a change and quite possibly a pleasant surprise. It may even grow on me with more listens, and I wish it does so for you.<br /><br />And if TAAB2 inspires those among you who are new to Tull or Ian's solo work to explore the catalogue, all the better, for you will become acquainted with the closest thing the genre has to a chamber orchestra. You may not like it all but there's a staggering amount of styles to choose from.<br /><br />I'll aim to add to my review if I make it to the TAAB1&2 concert scheduled for Atlantic City this October. That's a punishing tour schedule and it makes great sense to have the lineup who recorded TAAB2 on stage. I'll be just as curious as to how they adapt TAAB to suit.<br /><br />A word about Martin Barre, a virtuoso in his own right. He did not participate on TAAB2. He still appears on the Tull Website as a full member of the \\"non-touring\\" band. And I recall some years ago Ian saying that it's not Tull if Martin isn't involved. Say what you infer of Ian but he has integrity, and in any artist that counts a great deal.

0439023491|4.0|(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS; MOSTLY OF PRECEDING BOOK)<br /><br />In CATCHING FIRE, months have passed since Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on FIRE!, and Peeta Mellark, have left The Hunger Games as victors. Now comes the touring part, as they must travel to the other districts as part of their victory ceremony. Here, Katniss, hears and sees the beginnings of another uprising. The same kind that obliterated all that was left of District 13. As a precaution new Peacekeepers are shipped to all the districts and the once peaceful ambiance of District 12 is no more. Then, there is startling news...it is time for the 3rd annual Quarter Quell and Katniss and Peeta see themselves back in the arena alongside other District Victors.<br /><br />I was still reeling by how amazing the first was, that I tore through all three books in a week and a half. Suzanne Collins doesn't dare loosen her grip at the realism and bluntness these books have to offer. She continues to show the struggle to survive that is always present, and the grimness of Death that is always nearby.<br /><br />My one concern was of all the time spent back in the arena, there was a lack in those sweet types of scenes Peeta and Her had in the first book. There wasn't as much of that tension, or that advancement of their fondness, it was more of a simple understanding and letting the past stay in the past and moving on but still holding some aggression. Like that awkward few hours after you and your friend/boyfriend/girlfriend make up and you fear/feel the slightest little thing will tear the whole thing down again at any given moment. Which is both a good and a bad thing. Good for those who prefer less romance. Bad for those who don't.<br /><br />Nevertheless CATCHING FIRE, was a great addition to the series, and after turning the last page I immediately burned through MockingJay. This series is awesome! This series is gritty! This series is intensely realistic which, at sometimes, is both the PRO and CON of this series. Don't believe it can be a CON?...wait until you get to MockingJay.Don't believe it can be a CON?...wait until you get to MockingJay.
0439023521|5.0|I try to read fiction interspersed with all the non-fiction reading to give myself a break from harder reading and so I decided to give `Hunger Games' a go after seeing that the movie was going to come out and asking my mom if the book was worth it.  She said to read the series.  I read the book in two days.  I found the topic interesting in that the future where a small group of elite control everything and live high off the hog while basically enslaving the rest of the people to work and live in squalor is actually, if you read around off the beaten path, a goal of the powers that be psychopaths running the show currently.  If you read what is being funded by the government (think DARPA) you will see the technological horrors presented in the book or something along the same lines are being furiously pursued by the elite.  They want total control and are pursuing a means to that end.<br /><br />And so it was with that in mind that I think the book has relevance not only for entertainment.  I think it shows what the future holds unless people of conscience stop wanting to just have a quiet life without the responsibility to question and champion the causes of liberty and freedom.  The hunger games parallel the dog eat dog entertainment we are presented with as normal, such as Survivor, and it is high time take the blinders off and see the crap presented by the elite for what it is.  Sad to say the final touches on total National Security State are being put on as I write (NDAA, Executive Orders for full confiscation powers, Patriot Act renewal, etc).  It isn't for the majority of peoples benefit where something akin the life portrayed in this book is a rosy picture as compared to what is actually coming down the pipe.

0312263120|4.0|After reading [[ASIN:0385513755 The Da Vinci Code, Special Illustrated Edition]], I thought Dan Brown understands thriller, and I haven't been wrong. This book has all the elements of a good engaging story, and keeps you interested until the very end. If you like to read books of this kind, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Being a computer programmer for over twenty years myself, I understand people's frustration here. Other than the fact that this book is published in 2000, and probably Dan Brown has written it a few years earlier, there is no defense for the lack of fact checking and his research shortcomings. He should have done a better job in these areas, but you should look at this book as a fiction and nothing more. There are many movies far worse than this, and few really complain about them. Remember [[ASIN:6305047456 Hackers]], Swordfish, or Tron? Although the latter two are much better, they all got many things wrong. When Hollywood is going to make a movie out of this, they probably set their facts straight and update the script. Until then, this is a good fiction that keeps you reading.

B0073XORCY|3.0|Let me begin by stating that I attended Tull's 1969 concert at Devonshire Downs race track in Los Angeles as their first LP \\"This Was\\" was just hitting the record shops. To this day, I have hoarded every studio, live, spin-off, solo artist, and some bootleg albums by this once extraordinary band and its individual members. Progressive (Prog) rock has almost always received bad press as an anemic attempt to blend guitar/keyboard-driven rock with classical music motifs (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer leap to mind). Over the years, Jethro Tull has consistently and slyly evaded emersion into the Prog category by shuffling musical sensibilities before critics had an opportunity to nail them down. After all, one could hardly nominate British-tinged, folk-styled ballads as semi-classical symphonies.<br /><br />In 1972, Ian Anderson moved ahead of the genre and of the times when he orchestrated a double-sided, single-suite, vinyl LP titled \\"Thick as a Brick\\", a move considered to be pretentious by almost anyone who hadn't heard it. But, Thick as a Brick ended up as perhaps my all-time favorite album for many years, followed closely by the equally brilliant and \\"pretentious\\" single-suite, LP  titled \\"Passion Play.\\" Nothing had rattled my sensibilities in such a robust manner until King Crimson released \\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" a year or two later.<br /><br />Let me cut to the chase. Tull fans beware! TAAB2 lacks any of the fierce forward thrust and imaginative counterpoint of the original recording. A few musical passages between songs contrive to link the 40 year-old masterpiece with this current slough of cold porridge. While Mr. Anderson is famous for replacing band personnel, one can only wonder why none of his former mates appear on this recording. Had he released the CD simply as a new Tull album, the disappointment may have been slightly abated. But attempts to connect TAAB2 with what I heard in concert in 1973 at the Nassau Coliseum (performed on the heals of the original LP's release), by the band's best line-up ever, leave me wishing, sadly, that Jethro Tull's wisest future career move may be to throw in the towel.l LP's release), by the band's best line-up ever, leave me wishing, sadly, that Jethro Tull's wisest future career move may be to throw in the towel.

1572814136|3.0|I ordered this deck because of the immensely positive reviews.  One of the few negative commnents was by Wren: \\"I was terribly disappointed in this deck. Yes, the colors are vibrant. Yes, the symbolism is identical to the classic Rider-Waite. But the images themselves possess none of the artistry of the original. They are poorly executed copies. The faces of the people and archetypes in particular are dull, expressionless, lifeless. Consequently I couldn't connect with the cards at all.\\"<br /><br />I know the original Rider-Waite images quite well because the \\"original Waite cards\\" by US Games Systems (1971) was one of my very first tarot decks and I've been using it for more than 30 years. Having received the Radiant deck and looked through it card by card, I find myself agreeing with Wren's opinion.  The cards are very well made and easy to handle.  The colors are vibrant.  The problem is the faces.  They look plastic and non-human, kind of like creepy faces of manikins or the creatures that took over human bodies in the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Just look at the Page of Swords who looks like he's wearing a nylon stocking over his head the way band robbers do in some B-rated movies.<br /><br />In addition, the eyes are oddly drawn so that some figures look like they have a paranoid stare, and the devil looks cross-eyed. The subtlety and detail of Colman-Smith's original drawings has been sacrificed for vivid color.  The nude figures, for example, have had their genitals obliterated. The 5 of Pentacles is particularly distorted. With the new coloring, the destitute individuals look like they are wearing gaily colored designer clothes and the scene of desolation outside the church looks like a cheerful setting in which to freeze and starve to death. I have a set of just black and white cards of the Waite-Smith deck, and they are much more human, appealing, and symbolically appropriate.<br /><br />In summary, I like the vivid colors and the good qualityof the stock, but the humanoid appearance of the figures and the symbolic distortions are rather unsettling.  To get around this problem, I've taken to reading this deck with my glasses off so I can't see the fine details of the cards.  This forces me to fill in the images from my memory and imagination.<br /><br />For someone new to this deck, these issues may not be a problem because they don't have the originals to compare it with.  For someone who has used the original deck for many years, the images in this deck are likely to be disturbing distortions of the original.  For a more colorful version of the Waite-Smith deck, I much prefer the [[ASIN:088079416X Universal Waite Tarot Deck and Book Set]], which has been one of my favorites for many years.<br /><br />Addendum:  After playing with the deck for several days, I find that it is growning on me.  The vivid colors bring out some of the details that are not so easy to see in the original deck.  The card stock is quite good and should stand up to repeated use.  The faces still bother me but I am learning to ignore them.
B003TJ4YUQ|3.0|I was very excited to purchase the CD. I thought $20 bucks was a great deal for two CDs.  I got the CD's in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, the 1st CD had a missing song which happen to be the song that I really really wanted and the main reason why I bought the CD.  The 2nd CD wouldn't play.  I didn't bother requesting a refund as the money for the CD's went to a good cause.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Having been a long fan of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, I was very excited to hear that it would soon be coming to TV in the form of an HBO series. I waited for years for this series to start, having my own ideas of who should play what character and what the world looked like. Let me say \\"Game of Thrones\\" really blows me away. I am surprised at how well the series actually came out. I had high hopes for the series but those expectations were shattered by the end of the first episode. The world feels right, the characters play the part, and the settings are all well done. Overall, \\"Game of Thrones\\" in many ways becomes the TV-series fans have been waiting for as well as being a great hook for those usually turned away from the fantasy genre.<br /><br />What I find most appealing about \\"Game of Thrones\\" is not just this TV-series imagining of Martin's books but instead the amount of talent in the show thus far. The Stark children, especially Arya and Brann (played by Maisie Williams and Isaac Hempstead Wright), are some of my favorite actors in the show thus far. Peter Drinklage's acting as Tyrion is far beyond of what I could have ever expected. Then there are those moments where certain actors get their chance shine, such as Ian McElhinney's scenes as Ser Barristan and Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont. The talent behind this show, including set-direction and costume design, are really what pull me in.<br /><br />I have even gone so far as to recommend people just watch the series over reading the books themselves. I give \\"Game of Thrones\\" a thousand swords out of a thousands swords from the Iron Throne because at the end of the day that's really what the whole show is about.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it's something different for a change. I mean like there's nothing like it and where would you find a game like this anywhere. definitely worth $3.00. :)
B004QK5N5W|3.0|I bought this, as did everyone else - hoping it was the GREAT TOOL to bring your Ipod to your HDTV, but I waas extremely disappointed finding out that I was one of those who it does not preform as stated.<br /><br />I assume it might be a compatability issue with some TVs, I don't know - but when I hooked it up, it did not display the screen image from the Ipod, and after trying different files/programs found out it would only display Videos and slide shows from my Camera Roll and Youtube videos.<br /><br />Nothing from any games, home screen, etc., would show up on the TV, although the audio worked in all cases.<br /><br />It made this a very limited and very frustrating device, although I like the design and really wanted it to work as stated, it just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />It also came with no instructions, although figuring it out was not an issue, everything had its place and hook up was a snap.<br /><br />I gave it a three star rating, trying to weigh what it could do in a perfect situation and how it actually preformed for me. Ideally it might have gotten 5 stars if it had worked flawlessly. I would hope that somewhere a device compatability list existed, but I have not found one - that could save a lot of hopeful buyers from disappointment and returns.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|bookshelves: 1st-in-series, own-kindle, own-pdf, young-adult, series-hunger-games, fiction, fantasy, dystopia<br /><br />Recommended to Lissa by: Book 4 Review Club<br />Recommended for: Adult & Young Adult Reader of Fantasy, Dystopia, and Sci-fi<br />Read from March 01 to 05, 2012, read count: 1<br /><br />The cover art is simple; a solid black cover with Hunger Games scrolled across the top with a symbol that had I not read the book I would not have known it was synonymous with the one of the tributes among the game. The cover had never caught my attention long enough to penetrate the pages beneath the cover. That was the case until my reading group was gearing up to read the series prior to the movies release March 23, 2012. When I saw the movie trailers I was dumb struck; I had to read it. After all I can handle a book putting a movie to shame but a movie destroying a potentially good book I will not stand for. So I had to hurry and read.<br /><br />Upon diving in I was more impressed with the movie trailers' than the book it's self. I put the book down before I could finish the first few pages. I just couldn't get past the POV's perspective. Something about just didn't sit right with me. I know I'm no author; heck I'm not even grammar literate. Actually I am far from it. However, I am good at one thing... reading tall tells weaved from the imagination of talented story tellers. And Collins spin on the Hunger Games in my personal opinion was written to grab hold of fifth (5th) graders worldwide.<br /><br />After turning to another read I couldn't get the book out of my mind so I turned to other reviews trying to find something that appealed to me. I was shocked to say the least to find that others adults shared my views on Collins writing style but what really struck my craw was the written verbal assaults Collins has taken from adult reviewers since the books release in 2010. Reviewers that I want to point out are well above the target age group for the book. It's demeaning to an author to endure such assaults. Especially when any reader with half a brain can tie almost any book published to a previously published title. After all authors get their inspiration for the same place readers do.... Books, real life experience interpretations, and the interworking of one's own creative imagination.<br /><br />Now with a daughter in the target age range, I put my petty issues with the perspective aside and jumped in; kindle in hand and was shocked again. Because once I let my indifferences go I was sucked deep into the world Collins built for Katness and the Hunger Games.<br /><br />In \\"Hunger Games\\" we are introduced to the game through Katness' eyes. We get to feel and understand the world she has grown up in through her emotional journey. Quickly you come to love and respect Katness. At sixteen (16) years of age she is more of a daughter, sister and yes I am going to say it woman than most grown woman today. She lost her father to a mining accident and has done all she can do to keep her sister and mother alive from illegal hunting to adding her name to the bowl for extra rationings.<br /><br />When the seventy-fourth (74th) hunger games assembly is gathered and Prim's name is called, Katness again protecting her family steps up in a simple selfless act and volunteers as tribute. Katness' baby sister lives however, she doesn't understand the effect her taking her sisters place would have on the Capital or the districts.<br /><br />Enter Peeta, Katness male counterpart as tribute for District twelve (12) for the games. The sweet boy with the bread, the one who if had not shown compassion to Katness years prior would have had starved to death. Emotional goodbyes are given but not by Katness. She stands strong for her mother and sister. Again unaware of how her actions affect the people of the different districts.<br /><br />Preparation for the games is its own unique trip. Think America's top model meets made over and throw some over the top theatrics and for good measure think Miss America. Then end it with a little Spartacus meets gladiator to prep for the game. What do you get? A bomb shell delivered by none other than Peeta that rock's both the Capitol and all the districts. What could have Peeta said that brings the districts to its feet and Capitol stunned? Oh, how to would love to share but you're just going to have to read it. Trust me when I say you will suck in a stilled breath with eyes opened in shock.<br /><br />Moving on o the games... keep your box of Kleenex handy because you're going to need them. In a game where twenty-four kids fight to the death and the only rules are no cannibalism and one winner; what will it take to bring home both Peeta and Katness? Can it even be done? Will Peeta turn on Katness to save himself?<br /><br />Soon another bomb shell is dropped on the Capital as katness delivers a blow to the Capitol that rings through to each district as Katness faces the death of a friend in the game. In this one simple act of mercy and compassion she further brings together the districts and unsettles the Capital.<br /><br />Uneasy Snow drops a game changing rule, in a game with no rules that could save a mortally injured Peeta. But is it too late? Did Snow change the rules in time to save Peeta? Or did he change the rules just so Katness and the districts could watch Peeta die? Does Katness have what it takes to save them both?<br /><br />My recommendation-- if you haven't yet read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and can overlook the perspective as I did-- READ IT!! It truly is an emotional story that will envelope you and push head long in to the sequel \\"Catching Fire\\".e over the top theatrics and for good measure think Miss America.

B007DIQC90|5.0|In 2010, Of Monsters and Men won M&uacute;siktilraunir, Iceland's nationwide battle-of-the-bands competition. For those that may not think of this as an impressive feat, keep in mind Iceland is the country that has given us the likes of Sigur R&oacute;s and Bj&ouml;rk. Drawing early comparisons to Arcade Fire, Mumford and Sons, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Of Monsters and Men is an alternative folk sextet led by the vocal pair Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir and Ragnar Þ&oacute;rhallsson. After a race between labels to sign the band, Of Monsters and Men landed with Universal Music Group and now their highly anticipated debut is finally here.<br /><br />Considering the recent success of debut records by Mumford and Sons as well as The Head and The Heart, fans' expectations for Of Monsters and Men are understandably high. With a wide variety of instruments including brass, accordion, glockenspiel, melodica, piano, and guitar filling any of the gaps left by the stellar vocal harmonies, Of Monsters and Men have clearly latched onto a winning formula within their genre. The two lead vocalists could both easily carry an album on their own, but it is the blending of their voices that sets Of Monsters and Men apart from any act that could be considered their competition.<br /><br />There are many moments, however, when one of the two voices is given the lead. The result is as much a pleasant change of pace as it is a means for building the overall emotion of the song. For instance, on \\"King and Lionheart,\\" Nanna takes the opening of each verse alone, but Ragnar's voice is gradually blended in more and more. The instrumentation of the track grows substantially behind the voices as well so by the time Nanna and Ragnar are both harmonizing every word together, the energy of the entire song has flourished.<br /><br />Similar to Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' debut, \\"My Head is an Animal\\" remains far more positive and upbeat than Mumford and Sons' \\"Sigh No More.\\" The album's opener, \\"Dirty Paws,\\" is a song about war, but when that war is between bees, birds, and furry animals, it's hard not to smile as you listen. With a chorus of \\"la la las\\" and the occasional chant of \\"hey!\\" the band practically forces their audience to sing along.<br /><br />Even the album's slowest moments have aspects that move the music forward and keep it from ever feeling tired. The track \\"Slow and Steady\\" lives up to its name in pace, but a heartbeat kick drum accompanied by a shimmering, reverb-laden electric guitar adds just enough to the harmonized vocal work to keep the five minute track from becoming labeled as filler.<br /><br />The debut single from \\"My Head Is an Animal\\" is \\"Little Talks\\" and has been making its way around U.S. radio waves since August of last year. Fans of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros will quickly hear similarities to the song \\"Home\\" thanks to the call and response between the two singers, the remaining members' chants during the chorus, and most importantly, the trumpets. Of Monsters and Men are well versed in the success of their predecessors, but there is still plenty of imagination in their lyrics and blend of instruments which keeps \\"My Head Is an Animal\\" from ever feeling like a copy.<br /><br />With music that builds such as many of the songs on \\"My Head Is an Animal\\" do, anticipation is an element that bands often overlook. In some cases, a band will just add to the number of instruments or increase the volume without building any anticipation of things to come. The music can still be enjoyable, but if the moves are predictable or there is nothing to surprise the listener, it's harder to make the song stand out. On \\"Dirty Paws\\" and \\"Love Love Love,\\" the band uses pauses in the music just long enough to make the listener wonder what happened. It's amazing how such a simple gesture can so greatly affect a song. Following these pauses, everything feels bigger and bolder. Although this techniqueis more common in a live setting, to hear it on a recording makes the first listen especially exciting.<br /><br />\\"My Head Is an Animal\\" is a fun record. That alone deems it worthy of a listen, but there is far more to it than mostly positive lyrics and sing-along choruses. There is also a certain musical chemistry between the members of the band that finds its way into the recording. The harmonies, not just between Nanna and Ragner but the entire band, are extraordinary. Every voice, both vocal and instrumental is given its chance to shine and when they're needed, reverb and delay effects never grow to a point of distraction. Like Mumford & Sons' \\"Sigh No More,\\" \\"My Head Is an Animal\\" introduces a band experienced beyond their years. To release a record like this at any point in a musical career is exceptional, but to release it as a debut is astounding. There are still plenty of records to look forward to in 2012, but look for \\"My Head Is an Animal\\" to make many \\"best of\\" lists come December.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Little Talks\\"s more common in a live setting, to hear it on a recording makes the first listen especially exciting.<br /><br />\\"My Head Is an Animal\\" is a fun record.

A home in Victors Village, for you and your family to live in as long as you live complete with a telephone. Enough money that you, your family and friends will never need for anything, so long as you live that is. And the best part... You never have to compete in the hunger game ever again. NEVER!<br /><br />However, the seventy-fifth (75th) Hunger Game is getting underway. And this one is special; it's a quarter quell. Once every twenty-five (25) years the citizens of the Districts are reminded why they should NOT rebel against the Capitol.<br /><br />In the twenty-fifth (25th) hunger games in its first ever quarter quell demanded each of the districts to pick among their children the male and female tribute they send into the game and for twenty-three of them their deaths. Who did they choose; the strongest, maybe the weakest or possibly the outcasts? You will have to read to see if all is revealed....Sorry!<br /><br />Searing forward twenty-five (25) years to the fifth (50th) hunger games the second quarter quell demanded to demonstrate to the districts the loss of life each of the Districts would endure if the Districts rebelled against the Capitol by sending not one male and female from each District as tribute but two. This was by far the worst not twenty-three (23) lost lives but forty-seven children's lives were lost and Haynich from District twelve (12) was its only survivor.<br /><br />What does this mean for the seventy-fifth (75th) Hunger games? What will the quarter quell demand of the citizens of Districts one (1) through twelve (12)? What cruel demands can the Capitol place on the heads of the Districts children's to remind them who is in charge? That to even consider rebellion what your death would be like??<br /><br />To even go into any details about the plot of the seventy-fifth quarter quell hunger games would give away the whole book. Let's just say that catching fire is a justifiable title for this book because the flicker of hope that was ignited in book one of the hunger games series is setting everyone on fire in book two.<br /><br />When hope is all you have can you truly afford to lose it? When you have so much hope can you ever walk away? Ask yourself this; what would you do to change things?e Capitol place on the heads of the Districts children's to remind them who is in charge?

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|What more can be said?  Navy SEALS - and the special forces of all military branches - are the real-world epitome of the defenders of freedom, and this superb film portrays them in a very realistic way.  Thankfully, those who made the movie used actual active-duty SEAL's to play the primary characters, rather than the typical Hollywood treatment of such: the oil-slicked, bazooka-laden bodies of Sylvester Stallone or Charlie Sheen or Tom Cruise.<br /><br />I've seen this excellent motion picture TWICE now at the theater, and can't wait until the DVD comes out, because I'm sure the extra features will be numerous and interesting to watch.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|bookshelves: own-kindle, single, young-adult, paranormal-magic<br /><br />Recommended to Lissa by: Books 4 Review<br />Recommended for: Everyone in need of a great read!!<br />Read from February 02 to 12, 2012, read count: 2<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern debut novel Night Circus has definitely lived up to the hype. It is an astonishing tale of woe that left me dazzled and increasingly intrigued with the turn of every page. The way the author draws the reader into the story by subtlety suggesting that you are indeed one of the bystanders awaiting the circus to open.<br /><br />The author dares to ask; what kind of circus opens at sundown and closes at sunrise? My first thought was a circus run by Vampires. However, after reading just a little further I too dared to ask the same surprising question. First, we have a circus showing up out of nowhere; open sundown to sunrise. Second, we have Hector and Celia performing magic with their minds. Third, enter Alexander another magic filled man who Celia tells... \\"My mother says I am the devil daughter.\\" Fourth, a wager is born between Alexander at Hector biding. Fifth, enter an unnamed boy who is to be a pawn against Celia. The plot was an outstanding mystery that kept guessing until the very end. How Bailey and Caroline fit into the story. Bailey's grandmother sharing the story about how his parents ran off to get married young. How poppet and Widget round the plot out. The anomaly that no one ever becomes sick, no one is born and no one ever die's. This little mystery is turned out to be a wonderful teaser that I utterly enjoyed, so simply written it is better than I thought it would be.<br /><br />I honestly can't compare Night Circus to any book I have read before. Though I find that the only thing I can compare it to is the movie Memento. Because it was in the end that everything came together. I was however, a little disappointed that the night Marco and Celia spent to gather wasn't more sassy, to say the least. But then again it was a young adult book. It just gave off the feel that maybe when it was originally written that it might have been written spicy. Then in editing it was chopped down to young adult. But I did enjoy it. I was much better than I had given it credit for to begin with.<br /><br />It was clear from the beginning I didn't like Hector or Alexander. It seems they could be of the devils broad to wager with small children. To be honest I wanted to keep reading just to find out what everyone is and what the wager with the kids was all about. It feels like the author was more caught-up in keeping the reader focus on the mystery than the characters, so much that the mystery of the game takes on more of a character than the characters themselves. In the end I found I was drawn to Poppet, Widget and Bailey. Now don't get me wrong I still had a feeling boiling under the surface that the mystery itself was the biggest character and that is truly what kept me interested.<br /><br />It was one of the best books I have read in 2012. And I foresee myself taking time to revisit it again in the future. And I find myself hoping the chatter of movie rights will be confirmed sooner rather than later.<br /><br />8 likes flagn again it was a young adult book.

B0073XORCY|4.0|By undertaking a sequel to the groundbreaking album TAAB, Ian Anderson has indeed set the bar very high. And by not reaching that lofty height once again has call for some people to get their panties in a serious bunch.<br /><br />With all the talk of \\"prog rock concept albums\\" harking back to 1971 the more direct line to this project would be from Anderson's last two solo projects. Yes, there is more electric guitar on TAAB2 than the mainly acoustic outings of the recent past, but the attitude and structure of these songs are a result of Anderson's recent solo outings.<br /><br />There are a few direct musical nods to the original TAAB, as well as a few signature Jethro Tull sounds. Shunt and Shuffle is classic Tull, but stops short before it has a chance to really stretch out. Kismet In Suburbia has the scrapping, chugging guitar licks that bring to mind Locomotive Breath.<br /><br />This is a very English album. The emphasis being on the words as poetry set to music. Anderson can sure turn a phrase, as we know his vernacular to be quite verbose. However some of his references are totally of today-- dishonest investment bankers, E-bay and yet two mentions of Starbucks.<br /><br />The musical arrangements of TAAB2 are professional, polished and note perfect. Perhaps too much so. The energy, abandon, originality and shear creativity of TAAB are not so evident here.<br /><br />As evidenced by the negative reviews it would seem that most punters want to hear the Tull of the early 70's, arguably their most creative period. But it's just not going to happen. And wishing is not going to make it so.<br /><br />Instead we should all be grateful that a musician in his 60's with a long and storied career is still producing relevant music that is better than 90% of the stuff that passes for recorded music these days. And reason to be cheerful-- Anderson is still touring so we might all benefit from hearing this new music and hearing TAAB in its entirety. And I for one will beglad not to hear Aqualung played live yet again.<br /><br />Again, TAAB2 is a great Ian Anderson album and deserves repeated listening.<br /><br />It is a solid triple. Missed clearing the wall by a few feet.

B004WR125O|1.0|The throughput on the UWF-1 is horrible. My afterthought was to return the item and preserve the single USB port on my Onkyo TX-NR509 for other uses. Any wireless bridge should work just fine connected to the rear ethernet port. I am using a wireless bridge with no problems at all.
0439023521|5.0|Ok, so I freely admit that  didn't even know this book existed until the Hunger Games Movie was released and I went to see it. This book has a lot of themes in the perfect blend and was a lot more explanatory than the movie was. If you enjoy the movie, get the book,  It will clarify small things that are seen in the movie but may not be entirelly understood until you read the book.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is one of the greatest books ever written.  Very inspiring.  I continually revisit this book (reading and audio).  It offers great perspective, and the speaks to the capacity of the human mind, body, and soul to overcome.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This pocket-sized knife sharpener is a great tool to have with you.  It is very simple to use, puts a very sharp edge on your knife, and is small enough to carry in your pocket.  I would have given it 5 stars if the body of the sharpener were metal, but that is no reason not to purchase this item.  I have sharpened 3 knives with it so far, and it works like a charm.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books in the series.  Although it is not the type of book I would usually read, I followed the advice of my friends and I am not sorry.  I enjoyed them thoroughly and they were worth every penny!  I will look for more offerings from this author soon.

B006O5Y0SS|4.0|Enjoyable movie. Casting was great with the exception of Owen Wilson, who was fine, but I wasn't sold on him in the role, and Rachel McAdams, who was cast in an atypical role for her that she played well. Loved the historical, literary references, and the scenery and music were fantastic.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is nice if you like to just play regular solitaire and not a whole lot of other. games.  It can get addictive at times but it does make time go by faster.
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is fantastic! It is by far my favorite lens to use. I'm a hobby-photographer and can't afford the thousand dollar lenses, so after a recommendation from a photographer friend of mine, I bought this one because it was actually within my budget. I love, love, love it! I think the ranges in distance are perfect for an on-the-go lens. My favorite pictures to take are candid ones (at parties, weddings, etc), so this one is great, because I can get in on the action without getting in someone's face. GREAT lens for a photographer on a budget! I highly recommend it.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I  think Red Tails was the best film of the year so far. I have actually seen worse films win an Oscar for best picture let alone been nominated. If  Red Tails doesn't at least get nominated for best picture for  the 2013  Oscars then I call foul and a big shame on the people who vote for the Oscars. I  think Red Tails had groundbreaking special effects  Which I have to hand it to George Lucas and ILM, splendid special effects indeed!  The acting was really superb. If some of the actors in this film are not up for awards for acting at the Oscars then I will say again, I call foul and a big  shame on the people that vote for the Oscars. I think the reason the media didn't like the film is because they are racist and they hate George Lucas. I would recommend this movie to any one who wants to be entertained and to people who want to see a historically  accurate  film about the  Tuskegee Airmen , who by the way \\"THE  TUSKEGEE AIRMEN LOVED THE MOVIE AND SAID IT WAS SO ACURATE THEY WALKED OUT OF THE THEATER CRYING\\"
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|enjoyed the first one so bought this one. was able to complete all levels with 3 stars in about 30 min total game play. there needs to be more levels and they need to be harder.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I very much enjoyed \\"Quiet\\", which is well-substantiated yet easy to read. In a world where introverts are constantly asked to speak up or to say something funny/interesting, it is nice to read about all the \\"quiet\\" people who succeeded despite or because of their personality. It also makes you think about all the good ideas and interesting thoughts our extroverted world will never hear because it doesn't take the time to listen.<br />The book is no self-help manual that teaches you skills to become more extroverted - but why would you want to change? As the subtitle suggests, the book is biased towards introverts, but hey, extroverts probably won't take the time to read it anyway ;)
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Pretty much what the title says. I can't say I was blown away by the first book either, so I'm not really surprised that this book didn't really stand out to me. The writing is decent, the main character remains to be real. However, the \\"twist\\" at the end was really predictable, and it all had a very V For Vendetta feel for it. That is to say, I've seen this before. I can't decide whether I'll finish this series or not, but I enjoyed The Girl of Fire and Throrns and Cinder considerably more than this series so far. The idea of it was good, but once outside the society the main character grew up in, it fell a little flat to me. It's simply nothing special.
B0036B4ETS|1.0|At first the battery seemed to be working great (in fact, I used it on a trip to Orlando) but after less than one month it just stopped working!!! Too bad the return policies are not really useful at all..............
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I was apprehensive about buying this book, because we've all seen the million variations of Cinderella. Slave girl meets Prince, falls in love with Prince, happily ever after. You think you know how it's going to end, so you don't bother with this book, and you skip over it.<br /><br />Skipping this book is a mistake.<br /><br />Cinder's character, from her sarcasm to her relatable displeasure with her \\"faults\\" - in this case, being cyborg - is fun, understandable, and interesting. She's relatable, and she feels real - as real as a cyborg can seem.<br /><br />I've read complaints that Prince Kai is boring, and I guess looking back he wasn't the most exciting of characters. One could argue that he has a lot on his plate right now, what with an intergalactic war threatening to break out at any minute, or his pressing search for an important character, but I always looked forward to reading his part of the story. I guess it's worth mentioning that the book sometimes switched from Cinder's POV and went to Prince Kai's instead. Usually I hate this in books, but in this case, it was required and it was interesting.<br /><br />It's also worth mentioning that I loved Iko, Cinder's robot. If there's any question of Prince Kai's or Cinder's personalities, Iko makes up for both of them with her unique personality chip (which technically, Cinder helped make).<br /><br />The writing was fluid, enjoyable, and better than most YA fantasy authors I've read from as of late. The description of the androids, of Cinder's metallic parts, of the city, made it very easy to picture what was going on and who was doing what. I had a strikingly clear image of Cinder and her mannerisms and it made me feel like I was there with her, twisting on her too-small foot in her too-cramped work space. There is a lot of futuristic lingo, if you will, but it's always used in context that is easy to understand, and it definitely doesn't choke the writing by any means.<br /><br />I know I also read complaints about how the author didn't finish the story and there are still things left unexplained and how the author is moving on to the next book. If I'm not mistaken, the next book will be about Rapunzel, and if readers think that the author is just going to move on to a different story, a different world, and leave Cinder's story unfinished, then they didn't pay enough attention while reading. As far as I can tell, the story will continue - from a very different point of view, but to have it all connected by different characters in the galaxy, well, it sounds good to me. It is clear to me that all of these stories - in a series of what is intended to be five books, I believe - will be connected.<br /><br />In short, this book is getting five stars from me. I didn't have a single problem with it, and was nothing but pleased with the development of the story and the complications. There's enough going on - the virus, the Prince's search, the threat from the Lunars, what's on Prince Kai's android, Cinder's home life, etc etc - that it keeps you reading and wanting more. I can't wait for the next book to come out and find out what happens next.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This whole series is extraordinary.  You could look at it as a sort of historical fiction, but there is also the feeling that these places and events did not happen on this planet as we know it and there are bits of magic and monsters and Dragons woven in to give it the distinct feeling of Fantasy as well.  A suburb read.  Excellently put together in eBook format.
B00701QVVY|5.0|I have been a huge fan of overkill since the day Taking Over was released. And while I still think that Taking Over, Horrorscope, and The Years Of Decay are the 3 top discs in their collection, this one is right there. It is tough to win over nostalgia but this one surely gets close.  I havent been this impressed with an Overkill album since WFO, which I thought was really good in its own right.  If you are an Overkill fan at all, you will surely love this disc. There is so much old school sound in this one and Bobby delivers a vocal performance that I can only relate to Horroscope and The Years of Decay.  I dont think he has sounded this good since those glory years.  Black Haze and Old Wounds, New Scars are my two favorite songs. None of them are skip songs.  This is my first ever review on Amazon, reason why, freaking cd moved me to do it.  Please buy and support the band.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Nice story - beautiful horse(s). Was shot in a VERY BEAUTIFUL LOCATION, so there is some great cinematography here.  Technical kudos for the smooth camera work. I can also appreciate the effort and animal trainer talent that had to have gone into this movie.<br /><br />This horse goes from 1 set of hands to another throughout this movie, and the movie follows the horse.  There was NO REAL EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT in any of the characters.  When the characters lose the horse it is kind of similar to seeing a kid led away from a pet they will not be going home with or being denied the candy bar they so desperately want - you understand they are hurt but you are not moved to cry with them.<br /><br />This movie is interesting enough for one viewing, I THINK MOST WILL ENJOY IT - but I can't see myself wanting to watch this multiple times (as I do when a movie is really good).
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Although the events in the book are slightly far-fetched and some of the background stories of the characters are unrealistic, the beautiful and horrible depictions of life in India is fascinating and keeps me wanting to read on until late at night. I will be sorry when I finish this book even though I am anxious to see where it is all going.

0307949486|1.0|This book is a rather dull and extremely predictable mystery story starred by a fantasy \\"hacker\\" girl and riddled with ludicrous technical details from the world of computing. If it wasn't for these latter two elements and the fact the the author wound up mysteriously dead, no one would have ever bother to read it.<br /><br />When you drop all the fanfare, the backbone of the story is a pretty simplistic and mindbogglingly obvious detective story. The one clue which tells you how the mystery is going to be solved is given right in the prolog and the reader spends most of the book wondering how the characters can be so blind as to not understand the obvious. At some point at 75% point of the book the main plot abruptly ends and a new plot which is only marginally tangential to the first is hurriedly rushed in.<br /><br />The girl referred to in the title of the book is nothing short of a sad caricature. A thought experiment played by what reads like an adolescent male teen, trying to dream up what his fantasy geeky disturbed girl would be like. She's so edgy and strange! She's always wearing leather! Smokes and drinks 6 cans of coke a day! She's riding a motorcycle and doesn't clean her apartment! How bold! she's a genius with photographic memory and a natural ability to understand all things technical! And she really likes sex! If only such a girl existed I would have married her on the spot!<br />Seriously, it seems like every passage written about her is designed for the explicit purpose to give you, the male geek reader, an intellectual and physical erection and make your mother tsk-tsk her tongue in disgust.<br /><br />Finally, the technical stuff. You'd think that a published author would take the time to find someone who actually know a thing or two about computers to review his work. It starts small, with a bizarre insistence on detailing the exact specifications of the hardware used by the characters. This kind of detail is usually avoided like fire in works of fiction due to the simple fact that 6 months after the text is written everything it says is horribly outdated and pathetic. A 5 Giga-Byte hard drive! WOW! That's almost enough to hold the first 6 minutes of the blue-ray version of the film by the same title.<br />If it ended with these annoying details it would have been excusable. The book goes full retard about half way through with the heroic description of what is referred to as \\"hacking\\". Again, most fiction would have settled for \\"some techno-babble magic was done and now it is hacked\\". Not here. The author goes into incredible lengths describing the exact method used for hacking a specific computer. For anyone who actually knows a thing about programming, networks and security it reads like a something a child dreams up and which could have happened in a world where nothing makes sense.<br /><br />**** Spoiler - extremely technical explanation follows ****<br /><br />She breaks into an apartment to put some sort of \\"cuff\\" around a network cable. This cuff injects \\"source code lines\\" though the normal surfing of the web and these accumulated in the browser to make a 3 MB trojan. This trojan then leaks the entire content of the hard-drive to a remote server. When this is done, the user of the computer is transferred to working on remote copy as if it was his own computer and the girl she has access to everything he does. Lets break this down:<br /><br />- The physical protocol and the Ethernet protocol used in every day networking make it impossible to change packets as they travel in the cable without actually being a relay in the middle of the traffic. It can't be done using any kind of \\"cuff\\" that relies on the electric induction of the cable. The only way this is possible is by a box that the cable goes into and out of. Also, if she had physical access to the machine, she could have just installed the torjan directly and be done with it.<br /><br />- Even if that was possibly and reasonable, the so called \\"source code\\" which is leaked bit by bit would have been dispersed through many many packets. It would not be possible to accumulate 3 MB of anything in the browser simply because there is nothing which does such specific accumulation. The text seems to assume that the bits of \\"source code\\" have some kind of distributed intelligence that makes them stick together and form the finalized torjan. In reality there is no reason to believe this would happen. \\"source code\\" doesn't do anything when it is in dispersed fragments. Moreover, \\"source code\\" is the wrong term to use here. If you have source code it must be compiled before it can do anything and browsers have no means of doing this either.<br /><br />- Even if that somehow worked, there is no reason for a hacker to ever want the entire content of a hard drive. All the plot was after was emails and browsing data and that usually makes a tiny fraction of the content of a hard drive. There's no reason to download the entire porn collection of the poor fella.<br /><br />- Even if they were for some reason to get his entire hd on a remote server, there is no way to make someone work on a remote copy of his computer without him realizing something is wrong. Even with the fastest broadband available in 2012 standards, there is an unavoidable lag compared to working on a physical computer. There is also no possible reason for such a convoluted mechanism to be required. If all they need is to get updates of his emails, the torjan they already have on his computer would be enough for looking getting new information and sending it over. Also, if the computer ever goes off-line, suddenly nothing works since the remote copy is not reachable. I gather there are never any power and service outages in Sweden.led \\"source code\\" which is leaked bit by bit would have been dispersed through many many packets.

160094048X|5.0|I have been vegan for awhile now, and I do enjoy the occasional dessert. I love the variety of the cookies and bars in this recipe book. There are two helpful suggestions I might make:<br /><br />1. Don't be afraid to substitute applesauce for the oil! The authors make this sound like sacrilege. They state that the cookies will be lower in fat but not taste as good. I disagree. I think the use of unsweetened applesauce gives a lovely soft and moist texture while reducing the fat content. I'm not saying they wouldn't taste a little better with the original recipes, but I think that the authors kind of scare some people away from that little modification. So try it. Especially with the oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />2. It's okay to use less sugar. A LOT less sugar in some recipes. If you are a vegan like me, then you probably eat a lot of fresh vegetables, fruit, and beans. Unsweetened coffee and hot tea. Not a lot of processed food. Therefore my sensitivity to sugar is quite high. I would say that most recipes can be made properly with 1/3 to 1/2 less sugar and still taste great. There are some exceptions (like those that use molasses or need sugar for binding), but I feel pretty confident when the recipe calls for 2/3 cups of sugar going down to 1/2 cup. Just a little less. Again, experiment.<br /><br />But overall it is a great cookie book for those who are vegan or those looking to try out some dairy free delicious desserts. I prefer the desserts in the following two books, mainly because they are healthier(thought they are complete cookbooks, so they have a bit of everything and are not just desserts), so check them out if you haven't yet:<br />[[ASIN:1936661381 Everyday Happy Herbivore: Over 175 Quick-and-Easy Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes]]<br />[[ASIN:1935618121 The Happy Herbivore Cookbook: Over 175 Delicious Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes]]

B0061DOEJI|5.0|Ok, so I'm looking at the CD details and I see Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne and the Roots with Betty Wright and I'm thinking, Betty has given in to commercialism to sell some records. I listen to the snipets just to see how bad it was. I'm still eating CROW!!! This is the best CD I've heard from top to bottom in years. Every song can stand on its own but together, it's non-stop pure joy! Snoop and Wayne did just enough to add a special touch without becoming the focus. Betty tells a story with each song and if you miss listening to the lyrics (Because the music is so good), you miss the essence of who Betty Wright is. The selection with Lenny Williams is butta! This is what I call \\"Grown Folks Music\\" If there was a Grammy for having a complete body of work on one CD where every song is great, this one would win. Betty did the doggone thang. This is a must have for the real music lovers.
014241722X|3.0|This seemed to be a book that Grisham wrote for some young friends or family members who wanted to know \\"What is a laywer?\\"  There are long, didactic passages about procedure that stall the action.<br /><br />But the story kept our attention, and I actually liked the squeaky clean attitudes of the main characters. They are good people with good intentions, fighting bad guys. Refreshing!<br /><br />But the ending was so abrupt as to cause us to wonder if pages had been ripped from the book. Huge unfinished threads were left dangling.<br /><br />One suspects the editor said \\"This has to be less than x pages,\\" and Grisham pitched a fit and refused a rewrite. So they just tossed the last few chapters.<br /><br />It left us very disappointed. Not sure we will go on to the next one in the series, if this is the author's \\"technique.\\"
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I love to read memoirs, especially for places such as North Korea.  They are such a mystery and to hear first hand what it's like to be there just fascinates me.  This book was SUPER well written.  It's non-fiction (which I love) but much of it is told in a \\"fiction style\\" so you hardly remember it's real.  The author steps in occasionally and adds some background information, reminding the reader that it's non-fiction, but it's not a lot nor is it intrusive.  In fact, it's integral to the story and the perspective of the people in the book to have a historical background.<br /><br />I find that this is now what I refer to in my mind any time I read about North Korea.  I read an article on CNN just a week or so ago and thought, \\"Oh, that's just like in the book!\\".  I even had to see if the person in the article was the person in the book, but they weren't.  It's just a very common experience and the fact that it's common is not only disturbing, but lends me to believe the author didn't just pick the worst stories to tell for shock value.  She told a story about how it actually is for everyone.  I respect that.<br /><br />I had high hopes that the people in the book would overcome their struggles and there would be a \\"happily ever ever\\".  There wasn't.  Many have trouble adjusting to life outside of North Korea.  Many suffer PTSD.  Most suffer agony of those they left behind.  Most have not found happiness.  In fact, most of them seem to suggest (or outright say it) that they are horrible people for what they've done.  I don't think that for a minute, but it saddens me that they do.  Despite the ending being sad, it was real and well told.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for everyone.  It will put your own life into perspective quickly.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Based on the first two books in the series, I'm starting to wonder if Ms. Collins has trouble with knowing when to end a story. In the first book, the ending is an anti-climax and doesn't really set up any suspense for the second. The second book has a cliffhanger and that's a major improvement, but the way that it gets from the 94% complete to the 99% complete point in the story feels rushed and left me wanting something with a little more meat to it.<br /><br />As with the first book, I continued to struggle to ignore the first person present tense format, but the overall quality of the story (except for that last bit) didn't make that too difficult.<br /><br />A lot of the negative reviews focused on the lack of action in the first half of the story, but I have to wonder if the reviewers understood what was going on. It wasn't a matter of hairstyles, dresses, and which boy to choose. It was a game of perception and a demonstration of how a message can be interpreted in a much different way that the speaker intends based on the point of view of the listener.<br /><br />While there was less action and the action that was there was something of a \\"rehash\\" of the first book, the action was there to support the plot, not the other way around. Without going into any spoiler-y details, the things that go on during the action have a direct bearing on the overall storyline. Even if it feels like it's just her getting thrown back into another life or death struggle, the fighting is less important than the motivations.<br /><br />Overall, the book is pretty good and I'm eager to read the final book. I just hope that the trilogy ending is better crafted than the endings of the first two books.
0345803485|1.0|1. Poorly written.<br />2. Repetitive words, phrases and dialoge. We get it, the man has copper highlights. Holy cow!<br />3. Little character development.<br />4. There is nothing sexy about a man who is a control freak/stalker/sex addict who can't maintain healthy relationships.<br />5. There is nothing admirable about a heroine who allows herself to be physically punished for eye rolling.<br /><br />If you have self worth and a healthy sex life, you probably won't find this book very interesting. I actually feel a little dumber for having finished it.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I never suspected Vulcan's were more advanced than we are. What a surprise. What was probably the shows biggest challenge (Making everything seem new, and fit seamlessly into the Star Trek omniverse) turned out to be Enterprise's best accomplishment.<br /><br />The first thing I notice about 'Enterprise' is that the interior of the ship, and all the crews uniforms, are all dark blue and dark gray. The bridge and the crew's uniforms are so dark, that, standing on the bridge, to exaggerate some, it's almost as if they are faces without a body. For the longest time I guessed this effect was to highlight the crews expressions. I think, however, that the shows creators were trying to avoid the 'campy' feeling of TOS (the original series).<br /><br />Myself, I don't find Star Trek (TOS), campy, though I can see why people do. What people find campy about it, so I thought, was all the fist-fighting and Karate chopping. It could also be the way romance is portrayed. Perhaps it is the sets and the bright costumes though. There is actually more fighting on 'Enterprise' than there is on TOS. Admittedly, on Enterprise, more of the fighting is done with Phasors, tho, there's still plenty of, if not more, fist-fighting.<br /><br />Deep Space Nine and 'Next Generation' have the least violence I think. To me, Next Generation was like Star Trek for women. Not just because there's considerably less violence. . . Perhaps the idea was, men would tune in no matter what. Next Generation has a lot going on, there are twice as many main characters as there are on Enterprise or on TOS. In Next Generation, it looked like the character of Spock had been split off into three separate characters. It took three characters to replace Spock (Data, Worf and Troi). Data is obvious. The connection between Worf and Spock, is that they both have alien rituals the crew get to explore/find out about, and they are both very strong. Troi, represents Spock's mind-meld and similar powers, he-he.<br /><br />I brought this idea up to a Star Trek fan once, that they simply took Spock and spun him off into three characters. . . This fan, really, enlightened me. He mentioned, it's been said Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, represent three aspects of one human being. The human ID, Ego, and conscience, respectively.<br /><br />After watching Star Trek since, I believe this is true. Like in those old TV shows... where the figure of a devil will stand behind one side of a character, saying 'do it!' and an angel behind the other, 'you'll regret it!', McCoy will stand right behinds Spock ear... \\"all those colonist will have to die, that's the logical thing, isn't it Spock?\\". Spock is pretty easy to figure out too. Don't be confused by Kirk, the impulsive and instinctive one, being in charge of the ship! (googling this there's some confusion as to who represents what lol). It's not something I think about when I watch the old show. In her autobiography, Nichelle Nichols says it was another producer and not Roddenberry who came up with the Kirk, Spock, McCoy dynamic.<br /><br />It's interesting that Kirk has been the kindest of the captains so far. Of the five captains, in my opinion, he's been the nicest guy. I am biased. The original is my favorite. They do say your first will always be your favorite.<br /><br />Something I noticed about Next Generation, is that each episode seems to have two themes going on. The first, the American way of life -er the Federation way of life, is in danger somehow, and the crew have to maneuver in order to save it. The second theme going on, is that someone, often a crew member, has some kind of personal problem they need to work out, and, as the episode progresses, not only is the Federation as we know it, saved, but the personal problem is resolved too. And both problems will be shown as having equal relevance! 'Enterprise' continues this trend albeit with considerably more emphasis on adventure.<br /><br />There are things to complain about on Enterprise. The women on the show are too passive. T'Pol rarely uses her Vulcan fighting skills and is often even a damsel in distress. And could Hoshi Sato appear more vulnerable? One could speculate that Sub-Commander T'Pol and Ensign Sato, and the rest of the crew, are nice people from a nicer future. A better future. One, where, Earthlings at least, are encouraged to express all their feelings. Sometimes it worked well. Sometimes the damsel in distress theme got annoying.<br /><br />I had some problems with season three, the one that focused on the Xindi threat, I think mainly because of some of the alien costumes. With the Xindi, however, Enterprise was really able to accomplish something. The Xindi threat is simply the most memorable Star Trek encounter. For me anyway. The Borg may be more famous, everyone may know the Vulcan friendship sign, and the phrase 'beam me up' may never die, but the Xindi? they left the strongest impression in my mind. Perhaps 30 episodes on one theme can do that.<br /><br />Season four, though, was an absolute joy. What began, and delivered, with such promise, ended in what may have been one of the best seasons of Star Trek ever. Every loose end from the past was explored, and explained. It never seemed forced. It all made sense! And was fun. I've wondered, if the writers knew the 4th season was the last, and so they just took the show where ever they wanted. They do, however, rely a lot on fighting and special effects during the final season.<br /><br />Enterprise: successful as their mission.e. The women on the show are too passive. T'Pol rarely uses her Vulcan fighting skills and is often even a damsel in distress. And could Hoshi Sato appear more vulnerable? One could speculate that Sub-Commander T'Pol and Ensign Sato, and the rest of the crew, are nice people from a nicer future. A better future. One, where, Earthlings at least, are encouraged to express all their feelings. Sometimes it worked well. Sometimes the damsel in distress theme got annoying.<br /><br />I had some problems with season three, the one that focused on the Xindi threat, I think mainly because of some of the alien costumes. With the Xindi, however, Enterprise was really able to accomplish something. The Xindi threat is simply the most memorable Star Trek encounter. For me anyway. The Borg may be more famous, everyone may know the Vulcan friendship sign, and the phrase 'beam me up' may never die, but the Xindi? they left the strongest impression in my mind. Perhaps 30 episodes on one theme can do that.<br /><br />Season four, though, was an absolute joy. What began, and delivered, with such promise, ended in what may have been one of the best seasons of Star Trek ever. Every loose end from the past was explored, and explained. It never seemed forced. It all made sense! And was fun. I've wondered, if the writers knew the 4th season was the last, and so they just took the show where ever they wanted. They do, however, rely a lot on fighting and special effects during the final season.<br /><br />Enterprise: successful as their mission.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is freakin' amazing!!! Download any youtube video to mp4 format or any music video on youtube to mp3. I used this to download db's episodes 192-267 and all of them worked fine. Then I transferred those files to a flash drive, and then put them on my xbox to watch. I love this app! Works great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is really additive. it is so fun to play I play all the time. you should try it out you will be amazed.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|The movie is good and Kids liked the movie. I ordered this movie for my grandson's birthday, he enjoys watching the funny characters in the movie. He laughs his heart out every time he watches the movie.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book! It was so exciting, so intense. It wasn't too disgusting at all, despite what others have said. However, parents, if you have younger children, you may want to read it first just to make sure. i don't find anything wrong with it, but better be safe than sorry.<br />I devoured the first book and instantly ordered the second and I recommend it to everyone!
B0052U59F4|5.0|LOVED THIS SERIES!! It is quite the journey of two people figuring out how to live and love another with excessive baggage. Very adult, but not gratuitous. You must read all three!!
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I have enjoyed reading these again, but having a few glitches with Kindle. Also note that some things have not translated well to electronic format eg there is a weird combination of symbols that I now realise mean British pounds!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The watch works and looks great, has lost roughly 1-2 seconds a day which is acceptable. For the cost, it's a bargain!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a fantastic game - a really cool variation on the Angry Birds franchise.  I have spent (wasted?) a good bit of time playing each variation and they are all excellent, well thought out games - both fun and challenging.<br /><br />On a different note, why are you people complaining that in some cases it '... isn't free'  'It doesn't work on my Kindle Fire...', 'I am so mad...', 'Not cool...'.  Listen to yourselves...  You are complaining because for one reason or another something isn't free to you.  Sometimes you actually have to buy things - you aren't entitled to everything for free just because you want it - even if others get it for free.  What's wrong with you people...
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun, fun, fun, fun game. great for killing some time. keeps going when you're not playing. so you keep gaining money to play.
B005NQAPTC|1.0|In reading and ordering this product of Tony Bennett's Duets II, I thought I was getting both the CD with two additional songs and a DVD with added Videos not shown on the PBS TV Show. I only got the CD with two extra songs and the ability to see several (not all) video episodes of the show on the internet that were already on the DVD.  I had to pay $44.96 for this privilege vs. half the price if I had ordered the CD and DVD separately which I eventually did.

B002JM1VJG|1.0|Do not buy this!  Warner stated uncensored version of Justify My Love and this actually has the censored version!!!  Also, has the censored version of Erotica.  The remastering looks terrible due to using single layer DVD's, not dual layer and the sound mix of the Dolby 5.1 is poor sounding.....more like a matrix 5.1 track.  Also, missing many key videos!!!  Warner needs to recall this piece of crap and give it the proper job it deserves!!!  Amazon shouldn't even sell this!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great solitaire app, no complaints! I love the options available.  even if u choose a winning game, it is still challenging.
B0062O85IW|4.0|Great book for those that are beginners or intermediate in knowledge of Excel 2010.  Advanced users may still get some use out of it.  I have been using this series of titles for nearly 10 years and have never been disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is very good. But it is more than just an entertaining read. It is a deep thinking book. Unfortunately, the majority of people who recommended this book to me I don't think got that aspect of it.<br />Sure...this book is for anyone looking for an entertaining novel, but be ready to think about it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I dig the app but the ads are annoying. I'd pay to remove ads if it was an option.  Good basic solitaire app, clean interface... simple and elegant.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|I read the reviews before buying this for my son.  Many wrote that it didn't shoot as strong as they'd thought, and that it'd shoot farther without the barrel extension - I agree with both those statements.  The gun we got will shoot a dart about 20 feet max - it just doesn't have a very strong spring - and that's without the barrel extension, which steals about 5-7 feet.<br /><br />But my son doesn't care, he loves it.  The clip system is pretty cool, you can load more clips into the buttstock, and the bolt action is smooth and fun.  We're going to keep it and just aim high.
0439023483|5.0|This book was outstanding it was very addicting, as soon as you picked it up you could not put it down there was so much suspense and action. When you read a part that had violence in it you had a very detailed mental desription, and it felt like you were actually there. If I had to recommend this book I would i would want everyone read this book. You can also see the movie but the book is way better then movie they cut out parts so if you had to I would see the movie first before the book if you read the book then see the movie, the whole movie would be ruined for you.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is yet another in the long line of great phantom music.  The costumes are supurb, the staging is very unique, and the colors are fantastic.  All together it is a visual delight for the eye and a wonder for the eye.  Any phantom fan or a phantom first timer will revel in its sound and beauty.
B004UID2LC|5.0|who ever said they didn't like this app must not know how to use it! it is awesome and a great way to store cool videos so it can be easily shared with friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for adults and kids everyone loves it. something for everyone. every thing is not as easy as it sounds. some you got to be quick.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|Not sure I can add anything people haven't already said, I took a chance on this and was well rewarded for it.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|I like to keep things simple, I used to be the guy that bought all the accessories to the devices, I spent more money on accessories than in the device itself to later find out I just used a [couple of them, so I decided to keep it simple and now I just buy a sleeve, case, or whatever per device, once they break I buy another one. This sleeve is all you need for the Kindle, the device itself is already lightweight and small, and this sleeve protects it very well, you don't have space for a cable, thats true, but the battery on this device lasts very long so there is no need to carry around the cable or any other thing. the material feels good quality and the interior is soft so it won't scratch your kindle.<br /><br />In summary, if you got a kindle touch instead of a kindle fire, it means you like it simple too as I do, with this sleeve the kindle is still less than half a paperback book in width.

1594203059|1.0|This is the first time I've ever read a novel about Western Civilization where I was either laughing out loud or wanting to punch the author in the face. I call it a novel because it is such a laughable attempt at historical analysis it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. It's elitist ideology at it's worst, Kipling would have loved it. For example, Ferguson thinks the West did the rest of the world a favor by colonizing and exploiting it. I guess there must be plenty of people who subscribe to this outrageous point of view, but I am certainly not one of them.  I know there is a point of view that says we are waging a clash of civilization type of war against the Middle East for 'their own good' or for 'humanitarian purposes' so Ferguson could be an advisor to President Obama on this point. His analysis is delusional and absurd, for example stating that the USA is a model for widespread prosperity because our wages are so high. I guess he's missed the past 50 years when wages have fallen dramatically, creating an enormous gap between a wealthy 1% and the rest of our population. In his mind we are still a model democracy and the rightful leader of the world. Certainly our ruling class and gung ho flag waving Americans who want to believe we are wonderful and good would subscribe to that, being equally deluded and out of touch with current realities. There are some interesting facts, but it's not worth wading through the elitist propaganda to get to it. A terrible book, in short, I do not recommend it at all, unless you want to raise your blood pressure to no purpose.
B00000JLWW|1.0|if cameron was going to take liberties of the story of this dreadful tragedy and use it as a backdrop to a corny love story he should have gone the whole hog and had the ship making it safely to port and have the 2 lovebirds go off into the sunset.i mean you may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with how this was directed and acted. Engrossing. I'd say 4.5 stars. But I'll go up In this case.
B006A819AG|3.0|First, let me say that I am an AVID Roots fan. \\"Things Fall Apart\\", \\"Illadelph Halflife\\", \\"Game Theory\\", \\"Do You Want More?\\" and \\"How I Got Over\\" are some of my favorite albums and are some of the most underrated albums of all time, in my opinion. But \\"Rising Down\\", \\"Phrenology\\", and \\"Undun\\" leave A LOT to be desired.<br /><br />The Roots have set such a high standard with their ground breaking material and sensational live performances that diehards like myself tend to get spoiled sometimes. This album, while not a total waste, reminds me that The Roots are mere mortals like the rest of us and can sometimes disappoint. Why am I disappointed? Well for one, most of the songs are way too short: 7 of the 14 tracks are under 3 minutes long! If that doesn't scream rip off, I don't know what does. And those same songs (true, some are simply interludes...which is even worse) are some avant-garde stuff (Will To Power?) that is not at all flattering to my ears. Some of it is classical, which IS pleasing to my ears but seems so wildly out of place on this album.<br /><br />With the negative out of the way, here is a list of some of the more noteworthy tracks:<br /><br />- One Time (Good.)<br />- I Remember (Sounds great, though lacks sufficient lyrical content. Leaves you wanting more.)<br />- Stomp<br />- Lighthouse (We've all been here before. Listen to the lyrics, I won't spoil it.)<br />- The Other Side (Top notch. Period)<br />- Make My (Heavy, but kinda weird vibe here, can't describe it. The video brings the feeling home.)<br /><br />Look, I get that artists need to explore and broaden their artistic visions in order to grow. But this album seems to stagger too much, lacking equilibrium and artistic direction. If I know The Roots, the product will be a bit tighter next time.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an amazing book. I knew a lot about the rennaisance, but the way this guy ties Greek an roman writing into it blew me away.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Usually remakes pale in comparison to the original, but I really enjoyed this one so much than the original! Director David Fincher ([[ASIN:B00003W8NM Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000XCZGV8 Zodiac: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0034G4P7G The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]], [[ASIN:B001U0HBPQ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (The Criterion Collection)]]) proves with this that he is right up there with America's best directors such as Speilberg, Scorsese, etc. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian did what most consider nearly impossible -- taking a wonderful film and making an even better updated version. And just when I thought nobody could portray hacker Lisbeth Salander better (or any more of a bad@$$) than Noomi Rapace, then came Rooney Mara! Wow! Her portrayal of Lisbeth elevates the character to \\"all-time great character\\" status! The performances are masterful and the story and pacing are just right! The story doesn't pull an punches (nudity, rape scene, sex scene) but it is a must-see for any murder mystery/thriller fan!
B00785P2QC|3.0|I agree with mort people here. it is fun but I refuse to spend real $ do I guess I will be a slow player
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|The main problem with this film was that is is advertised as a prequel, the overall plot is so similar to the original that it just seems like a remake. And while that may be OK for the new generation of filmgoers who haven't seen the original, for all the majority of us who *have* seen the original, this is just sort of a waste of time. There is no clue as to where this \\"thing\\" comes from (other than space), what motivates it, or anything else that may differentiate from the original, even though that is the point of this film. The performances were good but the story predictable; sure, it ends directly how the beginning of the original starts, but the movie (as a whole) is sort of a waste). See the original 1982 John Carpenter version ([[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing (Collector's Edition)]]). It's good enough.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I play this a lot.  very entertaining. good game for just mindless play. I spend a lot of time just cruising through the trees.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Say what you will about Woody Allen, but the man is a master of moviemaking -- particularly dialogue. I haven't really enjoyed the past ten years of his films (save [[ASIN:B002LMV7RA Whatever Works]]), but this film returns to the Allen films that I love (think [[ASIN:B00004STRD Sweet and Lowdown]]). The idea is genius and the story just pops! I just finished a college course on Hemingway and Fitzgerald, so this was a sweet bonus to watch. And the actors who portray Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill) are excellent! Especially Stoll. I also enjoyed the appearances of other artists and writers (Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Henri Matisse, T.S. Eliot, Josephine Baker, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas). Allen takes a concept that most fall into -- that of wanting to live in another time (I myself have sometime I wished in Paris in the 1920s also, or in the 1930s) -- and finds his own voice of explaining its fault. For anyone who knows of these artists, writers and musicians, you'll love the small \\"inside trivia jokes\\" referenced. A really well-done film that grabs my honorable mention for top film of 2011.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|I am a pretty new Avenged Sevenfold fan but I absolutely love this album.  Every track is great and still very different from each other.  I would highly recommend this album to others.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|SO-DER-BEEEEERRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! This was one of my most anticipated films of 2012, and now, after seeing it, I feel like it fizzled. The film was OK but not as good as the trailer makes it out to be. The story is simple, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that a lot of needless plot points were thrown in. I've always felt like director Steven Soderbergh is very overrated; his films aren't that good. And this proves that point. The cast itself was stellar (Carano is beautiful and can majorly kick butt), and I like the way the hand-to-hand combat scenes had no music or fancy sound effects, but a so-so story and lackluster ending make this film forgettable.
0525950079|1.0|I've enjoyed other books by Ken Follett, but this was a long long story.  I was disappointed with the love scenes which were crude and repetitive.  There was nothing repetitive.  The characters were underdeveloped and didn't grow over the forty or so years the story ran.  The plot was ponderous and from one section to the next the author repeated himself, telling the reader what had happened, who people were, by simply repeating himself.  The story needed to be compressed, the main theme was lost in all the minor twists and turns and could have been omitted.  I ended up skimming it, without missing anything.
B005FITIK0|3.0|This got a lot of positive reviews and while both Theron and Patton Oswalt are superb in this and it certainly is a major improvement from writer Diablo Cody's last film (the downright horrible [[ASIN:B002W21AZI Jennifer's Body (Unrated)]]), there's not much that impressed me. One critic said that some characters don't change, and that rule is OK for minor or supporting characters, but when your lead character/protagonist learns absolutely nothing from the past two hours (hour and a half), then the viewer is left to wonder why they even watched a film that went nowhere in the first place. While this was a definite step-up from [[ASIN:B0041KKYGU Bad Teacher (Unrated Edition)]] (didn't you know? Bad girls were SO in this past year?!), it's still not enough to earn the acclaim that it's received. The best thing about this movie (besides the acting) was Mavis' (Theron's) meltdown near the end of the film. REALLY well-done!

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I'm not Tom Cruise's biggest fan in real life, but his movies are good. The same can said for me about the \\"Mission: Impossible\\" movie series. The first one absolutely stunk, the second was a step in a better direction but still was lacking in story. It wasn't until J.J. Abrams ([[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)]], [[ASIN:B0036EH3WU Lost: The Complete Collection]], [[ASIN:B004EPYZPS Super 8]]) took the reins by directing [[ASIN:B000HRMAPE Mission: Impossible III (Widescreen Edition)]] that the series really became exceptional. Even though Abrams did not direct this one, he produced it and made the unconventional -- albeit wise -- choice of hiring director Brad Bird ([[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]], [[ASIN:B00009M9BK The Iron Giant (Special Edition)]]), making this his first live-action film he's directed. This film is also the first time that the story has centered not just on Cruise's Ethan Hunt character. It also spends equal time on his support team -- an Island of Misfit Toys-type, ragtag group of characters, all of whom have their own issues and faults: Paula Patton's Jane Carter, Jeremy Renner's William Brandt, and Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn. Abrams and Cruise have delivered by far the best action film of the year (not only in action but also story)!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and it's the main Christmas CD I listended to this past year. Buble does a wonderful job of every song that he covered!!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I don't know why this film has been mostly panned by critics. I think it completely earned its Academy Award nomination! Newcomer Thomas Horn (a youth \\"Jeopardy\\" winner) is amazing, and I have to say that this is one of the very few times where I enjoyed the film better than the novel (by Jonathan Safran Foer). Screenwriter Eric Roth is known as the screenwriter for some very memorable, sentimental fare ([[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B001U0HBPQ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (The Criterion Collection)]]) as well as, in my honest opinion, the best contemporary spy films ([[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000MXPE7O The Good Shepherd (Widescreen Edition)]]), and here he took a oft-times choppy book and masterfully adapted it into a story that is easier to follow and more audience-friendly, but without compromising the overall message and integrity of the story. The film is emotional on all levels and a true hallmark of emotional resonance. It's a story of the beauty that can be found in the unique and how the actions of one can affect a countless number of others we never thought possible. Truly one of the year's best!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like it but then I don't like the game. it has so many adds it is agarvait. there are more than just one thing to do in just one little app.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|The story about one of America's most fascinating men is played to perfection by DiCaprio (who, once again, was robbed come Academy Award nomination time), but the screenplay by Dustin Lance Black (Oscar-winning screenwriter of [[ASIN:B001QUF3SW Milk]]) was too all-over-the-place. Sometimes, these jumbled mix-up flashback stories are too mixed-up! Thus is the case with \\"J. Edgar.\\" Nevertheless, a fascinating character study of a man who, although hated by most, was detrimental to the criminal investigation and justice system of this country. The stand-out actor is also Armie Hammer, who wowed enough in [[ASIN:B0034G4P7G The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] but really didn't have his drama chops tested until this film. Wow! It's almost impossible to make a film about a man who lived through so much because a filmmaker would want to get as much in the film as possible (I wanted to see it all), but there's only so many hours in a film. Until a better adaption comes along, this one will do.
B0058VW36U|5.0|its way better than quell so this should ne the top rated game and the game is cool because the little turtle dude I met him at Disney land and he hung out with me.
B005HSL626|2.0|The \\"Free\\" Fruit Ninja is a great game for my grands, however, the adds at the end of each game is very annoying and to indept for young childern.

Great game, bad ads; deleted from android.[[ASIN:B005HSL626 Fruit Ninja Free]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Did I enjoy this book: I really did! Even more the second time around. Catching Fire is a second book in a trilogy that doesn't disappoint and doesn't read as a second book. So many second books are mere bridges between the set-up of the first book and the climax/conclusion of the third book. While this book does leave us with a cliffhanger, it is still a fantastic second book!!!<br /><br />It amazes me the small part of the books that the Hunger Games actually play out in, yet they dominate the entire series. They are always at the forefront...much like what the games are for the people of Panem.<br /><br />Again, Suzanne Collins gets me with her vivid descriptions. The arena sounds amazing. I want to see it! (I can't wait to see what they do for it in the next movie.) I really want to see Katniss's dress that changes during her interview. That moment in the book is a \\"read again\\" moment for me. (I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't read it.)<br /><br />Other characters besides Katniss and Haymitch were great players in this book. I had forgotten how much dislike I have for President Snow. The way he is described as smelling of blood and roses is so distinct and makes me want to wretch. I had always pictured Finnick as older, in his 40s - not 24 years old. I don't know why...but this time through the book, I paid more attention and I still pictured him in his 40s. And Peeta...oh, Peeta...such a great speaker, performer, a natural charmer. Yet he is hopelessly in love with a girl who may or may not love him back but has to.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: Absolutely!!! This is a must read series for everyone.<br /><br />Will I read it again: Absolutely!!! At least once a year.<br /><br />[...]

B007J4T2G8|3.0|So I just finished the book in two days and there are things I liked and disliked:<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />E.L. James has a very creative mind with BDSM (which is the first time I read a book that contained it). I thought it was pretty kinky here and there. Automatically, it was soft porn with a hint of naughtiness. The main characters were interesting for me since Ana does in a way remind me of myself as a college student (since I'm currently a grad student!). Christian Grey is very mysterious and crazy in an interesting way. These two characters do make quite a couple and their communication skills have been unique and funny. The e-mail exchanges made me laugh out loud. I think the plot was very entertaining and I did feel sad at the end.<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />I love reading and writing stories, but the one thing I avoid is repetition. Unfortunately, there was TOO MUCH repetition throughout the novel. For example, E.L. James repeats over and over \\"cocks his head to one side,\\" \\"hanging off his hips in a way,\\" \\"murmurs,\\" \\"ghost of a smile,\\" and many more that I don't feel like listing. It's something a young teenager would do and that requires a lot of practice of toning down the repetition (I've learned that in high school). I had to skim some parts. One part of the story made me feel a little squeamish when--I apologize for the spoiler--Christian has sex with Ana while she is on her period. That was a little too much for me and I (and possibly other women) would never picture myself doing that with a guy (I'm sure they'll be a little grossed out). I wish she had gone over it and just fix the repetition (that's the only thing that drove  me crazy). Any editor would have noticed that instantly and I'm surprised he or she didn't do anything about it. I maybe a grad student, but I would have gone over it before publication. Of course all authors have their unique ways of writing in their own styles, but the one thing they learn not to do is to repeat certain phrases over and over and OVER to drive the reader insane! That's just my word of advice.<br /><br />OVERALL: I am curious about the series and I will continue to read the next two books just to get the feel and find out what happens next. In a way, it's good to read a novel for fun and relaxation. But since I'm more of a Zane-reader, I can imagine her (THE REAL QUEEN OF HOT EROTICA) laughing at this \\"mommy-porn\\" stuff because it just somehow lacks the real sexual activities. But, I'm giving this series a chance just to see how the story continues to develop.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|This CD was hit or miss for me. Some of the songs I like and some of them I cant even listen to, they seem a bit 80s to me.
1400052181|4.0|this book is okay so far. i bought it for a college class and i gotta say that at least its not completely boring. basically, some parts of this book are okay, while other parts of the book stand out, giving the reader and extra little push to somewhat stay intrigued.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I can hardly imagine the sheer amount of research that must have taken place in order for this novel to be written. In that sense, it makes for a better textbook than a storybook. Although the plot does include a few unexpected twists towards the end which remind the reader that there are some characters in the book and something is happening to them, most of the content is presented in a meticulously dull manner. By the time the climax finally arrives, it is barely noticeable. I was mostly left wondering why the author even bothered.<br /><br />For me, the character of Katherine Solomon and the concept of research in noetic science were the most captivating aspects of the story. I thought that the \\"threat\\" of potential insight into the \\"mysteries\\" of the Freemasons was drastically overstated. Frankly, I doubt that the consequences of such revelations would be nearly so catastrophic in the real world today.<br /><br />To be fair, this book generated more interest in U.S. history and the capitol city itself than any other media that I can remember. For probably the first time, I am genuinely curious enough about Washington D.C. that I am considering a trip to see the places described in such intricate detail for myself.

0439023521|3.0|I usually like dystopian science fiction, but I was disappointed in this book. Most dystopias are about an individual who disagrees with their society and tries to do something about it. The idea is to give us a sense of moral outrage at the society (which often mirrors the worst aspects of our own society) and some degree sympathy for the main character.<br /><br />In this book, the main character's primary motivation for the last 2/3 of the book is to win the last-man-standing hunger games. Along the way she may gain a degree of humanity and compassion, but her goal of winning the games never changes. I kept waiting for her to do more than feel sad, angry, and disgusted. I wanted her to try to really break free of the underlying attitude/system that said \\"the only way out of here is to murder your way to the top,\\" but it never really happened. She may have manipulated the rules a bit to get a less horrific ending than the game's organizers wanted, but she never seriously considers any option other than trying to win the game.<br /><br />By writing this way, the author has made us little better than the decadent capitol dwellers...we are not cheering for a major change in Panem's society; we are reduced to cheering for a certain \\"contestant\\" to \\"win\\" the bloodthirsty event that defines this society. In the end, this book boils down to watching children murder each other for sport while we shake our heads in disgust but cheer on our favorite.<br /><br />I still plan on reading the other two books in the trilogy, but I am not impressed with the first one.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I must say that I'm very satisty with the product and the service!  I received it way before the estimated time, and the quality of the movie were awesome(expected for BluRays)!  There are lots of special features, over 8 hours of it...  As for the service, I will say that I will continue to order from Amazon.com.  The received product is in its perfect form...
0439023513|1.0|The first book was a master piece but it seems the author had no real plans after that. The second book she gets it together and slides by with another success but not as good as the first. The third is lot the author wrote herself in a corner and had to throw something together to get on the shelves. She looses touch with the story and gets lost in politics. She kills off all the wrong characters and strips nobelity off the others. I was glad that these books were not just another twist on twilight but I am disappointed in the trios ending even though she ends up with the one who best suited her after she becomes the mockingjay. The set up for this book and the events are 50% rediculus and by now is DONE to DEATH. I could not be more disappointed and wish someone would rewrite it. But you got to finish it don't you so just buy the dang thing. Maybe the movie will be better.
0517543052|5.0|It's an interesting introduction into zen meditation and bhuddist values. The first 40 page story of the book does a good job of setting your understanding of what is western values compared with eastern understandings.

0553386794|1.0|Whatever do people see in this tripe? It has everything that should make people make it throw against the nearest wall:<br /><br />Unlikeable characters? Check!<br />Confusing narration and utter lack of plot? Check!<br />Extremely pedestrian and unimaginative writing? Check!<br />Gratuitous violence which serves no other purpose than to shock the reader? Check, check and double check!<br /><br />But of course, the biggest sin Martin succumbs to is presenting a fantasy world with barely any fantasy in it and which, as a result, is toe-curlingly boring. If you want to read gothic snuff porn there are actually better choices than this tedious mess.

1451648537|5.0|This is an inspiring must-read!  Despite its intimidating size (500+ pages), you can zip through it effortlessly.  You'll come away with a deeper appreciation for what goes into building a business, creating new products, managing people, and dealing with fame & fortune.  Perhaps most fascinating is discovering what makes a genius tick.  You'll also gain a greater appreciation for the devices that are probably all around you.  Great thanks to Walter Isaacson for telling Steve Jobs' story in such an unique and engaging way. Interviews with family, friends, colleagues and enemies serve to thoroughly flesh out the man that we thought we all knew.

B0002ADXYI|4.0|Uriah Heep  \\"Very Eavy  Very Umble\\"  #186  (1970).<br /><br />I was only 10 when they released excellent hard/heavy/progressive album.  I finally picked it up in 1978.  As everyone knows Uriah Heep started in 1969.  One Rolling Stone  Critic said, \\"If this group makes it, I'll have to commit suicide\\".  (I can only hope he or she finished the job).  As for me Uriah Heep has had many ups and downs over their long career, but for the most part 1970 to 1975 were mainly up.  Led by guitarist Mick Box, singer David Byron (One of the best vocalist in the hard rock field), keyboardist Ken Hensley, bassist Paul Newton and drummer Nigel Olsson (who went on to fame with Elton John in the 70's.  (he also had two top 40 hits in 1979 with his biggest hit called \\"Dancin' Shoes\\" #18 and \\"Little Bit Of Soap\\" #34).  Back to the album,  the lead off track \\"Gypsy\\", is classic Heep, solid guitar organ hard rocker with good progressions.  the stomp of \\"Walking In Your Shadow\\", the gentle folk of \\"Come Away Melinda\\", about life during WWII.  \\"Dreammare\\", is a psychedelic rocker, the boogie of \\"Real Turned On\\" and the classic \\"Bird Of Prey\\", (my dogs really love this song)!  I recommend everyone who enjoys Uriah Heep, pick up the expanded editions.  The cover photo is David Byron under those spider webs.  The album didn't sell all that well in America or England, so they kept up with touring to get their name out there.  \\"Salisbury\\", followed in 1971.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this after seeing all the hype. But it was very clever. It's a compelling thriller. I was impressed to discover that it was written by a man as the main character (a woman) was believable. Before I Go To Sleep definitely delivers.

0553801473|2.0|SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I'm Varamyr Sixskins.  I'm here for the prologue to set us all up for the impending horrors of the North and all the excitement to come...<br /><br />I'm Tyrion Lannister, the most popular character in all of Westeros!  I spend this book meandering down a really slow river, ruminating bitterly about my life, misplacing my former charm, eroding all the goodwill I built up in the other books, and wondering where the whores go.  Though perhaps I should have been wondering where the plot went.  I also observe turtles and women, play board games, mouth off to all and sundry, and coincidentally run into various characters like some wandering monster in a D&D campaign.  Maybe I'll make it to Daenarys in the next book, but at least I ditched that pig.<br /><br />I'm Asha Greyjoy.  I don't have much to do, so I'll be the POV character keeping track of Stannis and his forces.  At the beginning of Dance with Dragons, he's working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons.  At the end of Dance with Dragons, he's...working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons.  Hope that helps.<br /><br />I'm Ser Davon Seaworth, the Onion Knight.  I'm still running errands for Stannis and getting captured frequently.  It's a living.<br /><br />I'm Bran Stark.  I am a tree.<br /><br />I'm Daenarys Targaryen.  I'm only a young girl, and I know little in the ways of war, governance, what have you.  I used to think I said these things to misdirect people, but as of DoD it seems to be true.  I spend my time taking baths, fretting, being wishy-washy, and mooning over this hot mercenary dude.  In the end I learn that \\"you have to go back to go forward.\\"  I would have thought that going backwards would be the last thing that this book needs, but I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of story advancement.<br /><br />I'm Aegon Targaryen.  I appear for the first time in book five as the long thought dead son of Prince Rhaegar and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.  I know, right?  What a surprise!  It's like I was just pulled from thin air!  I spend much of the book traveling to Daenarys, but then I change my mind and go and invade Westeros without her.  Sort of.  No one important has noticed yet.  See you in the next book!<br /><br />I'm Griff, aka Jon Connington.  I'm here to get Aegon Targaryen on the Iron Throne.  I tried to tell that kid not to wait until the fifth book to show up if he wants to be king.  Now nobody's invested in us.  We're like, peripheral  characters or something.  Nobody cares.  I (*sniff*) just want someone to care, you know?<br /><br />I'm Theon Greyjoy.  Turns out I'm not dead, though I rather wish I were.  It's been rough.  On the bright side, my chapters were some of the only highlights of this bloated beast of a book.  I even got to be almost a hero at the end!  Can't wait for the next book.  Redemption arc ahoy!  People like me now!<br /><br />Tyrion:  Settle down sailor.  You're not really a major character, and people still don't like you.<br /><br />I'm Jaime Lannister.  I snuck in to steal a chapter just like I would steal a kiss from my sweet sister.  Oh look, there's Brienne!  She's not dead after all.  Whatever could have happened?  Oops, we gotta go now, so I'll guess we'll never know.  Blink and you'll miss us!<br /><br />I'm Ser Robert *cough*Gregor*cough* Strong  *cough*not dead*cough*.  Gregor SMASH!<br /><br />I'm the Hound.  You know, I strongly suspect that I might not be dead either.<br /><br />Tyrion:  Quiet, you.  No one even mentions you in this book.<br /><br />I'm Wyman Manderly.  I'm a minor character, but I bring a bit of awesome anyway.  I was last seen bleeding from a neck wound.  I wonder if I'll die.  Your guess is as good as the author's.<br /><br />I'm John Snow.  I command the wall and defend Westeros from the horrors of the North.  I count sides of beef and sausages, receive messages, meet with my staff, greet newcomers, and find bedrooms for all the wildings.  Seriously, am I a commander or a butler?  It's the end of the book already, we need some action!  I'll march on Winterfell and retake it from the cursed Boltons!  Away we go!  Oh, dang it.  Stabbed from all sides.  There goes that plan.  It sure does seem like I'll die now...<br /><br />I'm Quentyn Martell.  I'm kind of a side plot that has no impact at all on the main story.  Then I die.  But the good news is that I really am dead for sure!<br /><br />I'm Melisandre.  I get a chapter where I play with fire and see things and act all cryptic with people.  Well, I have to amuse myself somehow.  It's booorrring at the wall.<br /><br />I'm Victarion Grayjoy.<br />Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main!<br />This book will end<br />Before I meet<br />Daenarys Targaryen!<br /><br />I'm Aero Hota.  Don't worry, I don't really remember who I am either.  Not much to see here, anyway.<br /><br />I'm Cersei Lannister.  I get two chapters of humiliation.  I can has some of Theon's reader sympathy now?  No?  Well then.  I won't forget this.  A Lannister always pays his debts...maybe in the next book.<br /><br />I'm Ayra Stark.

Maybe someday I'll kill someone who has something to do with the main story.<br /><br />I'm Barriston Selmy.  I putter around Meereen, trying in some small way to advance the plot.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|The first part of this novel is compelling, and the idea of flowers having meanings and being a form of communication is fascinating.  However, several important figures in the book act totally out of character at critical junctures rendering the story from then on unbelievable.  It ends up feeling like a moralistic fable.
0439023513|3.0|OK. This is how I rate the series. Book 1 = 5 stars. Book 2 = 5 stars. Book 3, first half = 5 stars. Book 3, second half = 1 star.<br /><br />Maybe that's being a bit unfair about the second half of Mockingbird, because without a doubt it was well written, but the faults to me were so enormous that I couldn't get past them.<br />Without a shred of doubt, Suzanne Collins is an incredibly talented author, with an amazing imagination and insight. But she struggles with building any kind of romantic connection or the development of a relationship.<br /><br />THE FAULTS (Spoilers from here)<br /><br />Finnick's Story:<br />Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. His character is developed beautifully. We go from abject dislike through to adoration. A masterclass in developing a character. What drives Finnick is unveiled to us bit by marvellous bit, to reveal a complex character, strong, yet abused and vulnerable who you have to admire. His love story with Annie is one of the highlights of the book for me even though their relationship was hardly touched on. I WANTED him to have his happy ending. Then what happens? The author simply throws him away. Gone. Dead in a couple of sentences without a backward glance. To me it was one of the oddest deaths in any book I've ever read. After all that, Finnick's death was just a plot device to rack up the sense of danger. Nobody's safe! Nobody's safe! It was totally and utterly unnecessary. We already knew that nobody was safe. What a total waste of a good character. Rule Number 1. Leave your readers satisfied. That was one of the most unsatisfactory moments in any book I've ever read. It would have cost the plotline and the energy of the book nothing to leave him intact to go off into the sunset with Annie at the end. All it achieved was a lot of dissatisfied readers. A huge emotional let down.<br /><br />The Mission to kill Snow:<br />Rule Number 2. If you are going to start something finish it.<br />What a mish mash this was. Really it was during this part of the book I started to wonder if the author had forgotten everything she knew about good storytelling. I can't speak for the author, but I think I see what she was trying to do. Rack it up, rack it up, Finnick's death, chaos, Gale's capture, rack it up, rack it up, Prim's death, and BANG! Katniss blows up and enters some kind of La-La land of Weirdness.<br />Except it just doesn't work. It feels more like the author abandons the mission half way through because really, she just can't be bothered.<br />Conveniently when Katniss returns from La-La Land the war is over. Unfortunately the Weirdness isn't.<br />It's a massive anti-climax.<br /><br />Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Overload:<br />Yes, we all know people get it. Yes, we want our books to feel real. But we don't want them to be TOO real. That's why we loll around the house reading instead of having a proper life. There's nothing interesting about someone who spends weeks in solitary confinement or hiding in a cupboard.<br />I know that's the real reaction, but I just don't want it happening to the lead character in an action story. The lead characters in action stories pick themselves up and get on with it. That's what they're there for. To carry the story. I think Katniss gave up right about the same time the author did.<br /><br />Gale? Gale? Where for art thou Gale?:<br />OK. So you start a story. Girl meets boy. Now, I'm not a fan of formulas and rules, but there are some things that always work and some things that will always fail.<br />Rule Number 3: If you are going to start a story with girl meets boy just make sure you don't half heartedly abandon the boy half way through the story. And for god's sake don't have her end up with somebody else unless the boy at the start was evil incarnate.<br />If Suzanne knew that Katniss was going to end up with Peeta, she might have started the 1st book with the bread story, and she shouldn't have invested so heavily in Gale. Remember we want tofeel satisfied at the end of a book, or we might leap to the computer and hammer out all our frustrations by writing horrible reviews on Amazon.<br />All through book 3 I'm waiting patiently for THAT moment with Gale. Only it never comes, even though I'm very very very patient.In fact Gale disappears without so much as goodbye, never to be seen again. We hear he's off doing stuff in Sector 2, and has apparently just forgotten the great love of his life even though she is now a bit doolally. Is it me?<br /><br />The End:<br />I could write a whole separate review about the character arc that is Peeta but frankly; I can't be bothered, so I'll skip to the end which is kind of what every section of this whole book seemed to do.<br />There are two things that the author really ought to work on.<br />1) How to end a story so that all the ends tie up and there's a certain level of satisfaction.<br />2) The development of an emotional attachment between two characters.<br />Both were so wholly absent in this book that it spoiled the whole trilogy for me.<br />Maybe she was trying to show that they were so damaged in the end that they couldn't connect to each other or even to their own children.<br />I have never in my life referred to my daughter as \\"The girl\\" or my son as \\"The boy\\". Never. It shows a level of detachment that is a wee bit scary.<br />Surely after 15 years, she's left the Weirdness behind to the point where she can give her kids proper names.<br />And her relationship with Peeta at the end? What relationship? If they developed one I didn't see it.<br /><br />The Agenda:<br />If you have an anti-war agenda that's fine and dandy with me. Suzanne Collins had three books worth of space to hammer home all the dangers of a future Orwellian type state and the horrors of war. Just don't let your agenda obliterate what people ultimately buy books for, which is a good story. I don't buy novels to told how to think. There's a kind of irony there.<br /><br />A weary attempt at satisfying a publishing deadline rather than any actual readers. The most unsatisfactory ending that I've ever read.

B0068MNO4S|2.0|If you've ever seen Shakespeare performed poorly, you know what 'Anonymous' is like - dense, confused, and wandering.<br /><br />There's promise here, with the always-impressive Derek Jacobi setting the stage for a tale of conspiracy and intrigue in the tale of the origin of Shakespeare's plays. But like those plays, how it's presented is everything.<br /><br />What follows is thick with vague politics and complex relationships in a story that leaps back and forth along multiple generations. Dense with exposition and light on elegance, 'Anonymous' tries to make the case for the possible origins of Shakespeare's work by bludgeoning you to death with its richly-portrayed sets and its historical figure name-dropping. It fails to make the case, but worse, it fails the source material.<br /><br />The works of Shakespeare here are presented tepidly, the scenes shown are the obvious ones (St. Crispian's from 'Henry V' and To Be or Not To Be from 'Hamlet', among others), when lesser-known scenes would have conveyed the idea better. The performances are weak when they needed to be powerful, too serious when they could have been pointedly witty.<br /><br />Like papier-mache, layer after layer is applied, in the hopes that you'll miss the fact that it doesn't really go together. What's left is a confused, drippy mess that neither captivates nor titillates, and does its source material a disservice.<br /><br />The mystery of who William Shakespeare was and how he wrote so elegantly and inspiringly may never be solved - but it certainly won't be solved by this ham-handed mess of a film. 'Anonymous' stands as an excellent example of what happens when great ideas are handled by lesser talents.

0525478817|5.0|Although I wasn't very satisfied with a previous novel of John Green's, AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES, his other books, LOOKING FOR ALASKA & PAPER TOWNS, were phenomenal and are some of my all-time favorites. Like its aforementioned brethren, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a tearjerker, but also well worth reading because it exposes heavier subject matter we all tend to neglect in our everyday lives. What, exactly? Cancer.<br /><br />I was introduced to TFIOS through one of my good friends in mid-February and, at first, was apprehensive about buying it on my kindle because (a.) I hadn't been satisfied with how AAofK ended, and (b.) I was leery towards any book that was labeled a \\"cancer book\\", thinking that I would barely be able to read through the first 50 pages without feeling too depressed and wanting to throw the book away.<br /><br />Of course, I was wrong and had underestimated John Green's ability to weave such a hush-hushed topic into a story that could end up on the NYT Bestsellers List. As the book infamously states within its first few pages, \\"Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.)\\". I was stunned at how the narrator, Hazel, was able to take her diagnosis so light-hearted it was almost like you weren't reading her story but you actually were her, living through the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations. Throughout the novel, I felt \\"grand\\", like I was \\"on a roller coaster that only goes up\\", pun intended; every chance I got to read, I did; whether in school or at home, I could simply not put the book down.<br /><br />The main character, Hazel, is a sarcastic and lovable 16 year old girl who has overcome the impossible: stage IV thyroid cancer. Withdrawn from school at 13, her parents and an author who doesn't knowshe exists, Peter Van Houten, have become \\"her best friends\\". She dreads going to Support Group every Wednesday, a \\"depressing as hell\\" place where other cancer survivors talk about their struggles. Until she meets Augustus Waters, a fellow cancer survivor (osteosarcoma) who has a prosthetic leg, a limp, and smokes metaphorical cigarettes, which he explains as: \\"You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing\\".<br /><br />Having found out that Hazel spent her One Wish on a trip to Disney Land, Augustus, having saved his, spurs a trip to Amsterdam and organizes a meeting with the author Peter Van Houten, whom Hazel is dying (figuratively) to meet so she can finally get answers to the ending of An Imperial Affliction, her favorite novel.<br /><br />As it turns out, Peter Van Houten is a selfish alcoholic and no more help than how AIA ended - in the middle of a sentence. Furthermore, while on the trip, Hazel finds out that Augustus has gotten cancer again and that it's fatal. For the rest of the book, Hazel tries to deal with a dying Augustus and then a dead Augustus because, no matter what, \\"That's the thing about pain...It demands to be felt\\".<br /><br />Heartwarming and eventually heartbreaking, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is an amazing love story about growing up and moving on that you can read over and over and, unlike others, never get tired of it.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|II found this a very unusual read. Not what I expected (A traditional suspense novel)it was more, and I look forward to completing this journey with Fin (The central character) in the next two books.<br />Well written, constructed and engrossing.

0439023521|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I just could not put it down.  The name of this book was The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins.  This book was about a girl named Katniss.  She lives in District 12 of Panem, a continent that used to be North America.  Every year or so, a boy and a girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, are chosen to participate in something called the hunger games.  In Panem, there are 12 districts and the Capitol.  Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is chosen to participate.  Since Katniss doesn't want her in the games, Katniss takes her sister's spot.  A boy named Peeta Mellark is also chosen to participate in the games.<br /><br />  This book is full of action and romance.  There is some violence in this book.  I would not recommend this book for kids under the age of 11.  The book might be too violent for them.  Also, there is lots of kissing and hugging in the book.  This is a great book for anybody over the age of 11.  Even older people may enjoy this book.  The Hunger Games is probably one of the greatest books I have ever read.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this book and there are lots of suprising parts in this book.  This book is also a little bit sad.  Anyway, if you love reading, get this book now!  Trust me, you will love it!<br /><br />  - Jonathan M, age 11
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|Steve McQueen is the star of this movie and he deserves the honor. It was a nostalgic movie that I hadn'st seen in many years. Funny, I forgot most of it. But I did remember how much I liked the movie. Well done and worth the time viewing. I have watched it three times since the purchase and love it more each time. But than again, I have ridden a motorcycle since 1965. So I might be a little biased.

B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is a lot of fun to play but to get really into it you have to be willing to post on facebook a lot or put a fair amount of money into the game otherwise you'll find yourself severally handicapped.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is an absolutely spectacular production.  The music is gorgeous, as is the video, with great choice of camera angles and well-selected close-ups so that you can get the feeling of watching a live stage production but with a better view of some nuances.  The vocalists, including the young Canadian Phantom, are wonderfully cast and all performances are excellent.  As a bonus, after the performance several past Phantoms come out on stage and do a number together.  If you like this musical, you will HAVE to have this DVD.
1451627289|4.0|Several people told me not to get my hopes up about this one, so I went in with low expectations. Maybe that helped because I really enjoyed it. I thought that there were parts that dragged a little, but the ending made up for it.

0156012197|5.0|I remember reading this book when i was very little probably like 4 years old. I wanted to read it again so I bought the book. This is a really good children books but it doesn't mean it is just for children it is a good book for all ages. It teaches you a life lesson and it has a very good story line that will just hook you in. If like reading a good book you have to buy this book. You should be able to finish this book in one day. Once you pick this up you won't be able to stop reading.

B005C0DHEY|1.0|A federal court has recently ruled in a Texas comapny's favor in its suit against the EPA and a group of townsfolk claiming fracking had polluted their water supply.  It had to do with the famous scene you see in the trailer of this film, a guy lighting up the water coming out of his kitchen faucet.  Turns out the townsfolk had conspired to hook the water supply to a gassing vent to create the effect.  This is not the only EPA fracking action brought to a screeching halt by federal judges upon discovering that the EPA has been fabricating evidence.  More cases are pending, so these won't be the last.<br /><br />Still, this film is a good lesson for children on the workings of propaganda and the lengths some people will go to to advance their political agenda.
B0073XORCY|2.0|Except for three songs or two, TAAB2 sounds like the Ian Anderson of today..........vanilla ice cream.........without the beans........Walmart's Great Value brand..........decent but nothing you'd go to the store for.<br /><br />Ian is easily one of the smartest, most intellectual people in music, but his creative well ran out of measurable water many years ago.  Occasionally, he can dip up enough water for a decent song.  If he had released just one album of his best songs of the last twenty years, he'd have a decent album, not great, but worth listening.  Even Language of Birds, arguably his best album in twenty years, is pretty hard to listen to all at one time........at least for us fans of the original Tull.<br /><br />The YouTubes of Jethro Tull are the best of any band.  There has never been a more interesting front man on stage, inmho.  But the Ian of today is an old man.  Frankly, if a young unknown Ian Anderson emerged onto the musical scene today with this music, he'd never get off the tiny eclectic club circuit.  Maybe too many years of having his sizable ego stroked has dulled his edge.  Maybe his near death experience with deep vein thrombosis forever drained his energy.  Maybe too many years of being a very British lefty, and rich enough to reside in the ivory tower has left him unable to connect to his roots.<br /><br />So, my advice for youngsters is to pick up the vintage Tull music and watch the YouTubes of Tull in their heyday and learn what great inventive rock used to be.<br /><br />After trying to listen to TAAB2 again, I like it even less.  I just read some of the recent raves for this and I am baffled. I have no idea how a Jethro Tull fan can find this music interesting, much less great.  The Ian Anderson of today is far removed from the Jethro Tull of the 60's and 70's.  I have no idea how anyone can equate this vanilla follow up to the staggering original.  A Tull fan waking from a 40 year coma to this music, would beg to go back to theirlong sleep.
0871404133|4.0|recently discovered this book upon reading about it and wanted to see what the talk of it was all about. this book explores human life through Dr.Wilson's personal take and also on the front of civilization and the base of everything from the past til now. very well documented and very well concieved from start to finish and i found the book very well written and articulated and easy to digest. you may or may not agree with everything presented, however i feel you will find the book well worth your time upon reading it and taking it into all acounts.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Now understand that these are young adult level of books. They don't get too much into back story just enough to keep you informed. While there is a hint of romance/emotional interest, it is not overplayed. The story moves quickly and with a fair amount of action. Now these books have been out for some time and I like many others would not have heard of it otherwise. Suzanne Collins if your still getting book royalties thank the movie studios. I blew through this in 5 or 6 hours(seperate days.) I'm kinda betting that these translated easily into screenplays and think I won't be too surprised to see it in film. I read this on my kindle through the Kindle Owners Lending Library. Now to get them to up the monthly lending limit.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I think that you can see by the majority of reviewers, this series is awesome. However, you will also see a few people who don't like it. There are really only two valid reasons for not liking it and one semi valid reason.<br />1) You don't like reading about people doing bad things to other people. Murder, torture, rape and meanness. I get that. This book has it. Probably not as much as the bible, but it does have it.<br />2) You just can't keep up with it. There are a lot of characters and each chapter moves you back and forth to a different persons perspective. There are very few indispensable characters. If you like simple story lines, this book isn't for you.<br />3) The semi valid reason is that the story will only be complete after all the books are written. Each book is a collection of chapters, not a complete story. Things will move forward in each book, but the end will leave you with even more questions to be discussed in the next book.<br />If those reasons don't bother you, you will love this series.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I have never been so excited for an album's release since I first heard this band's \\"Little Talks\\" several months ago on Alt Nation xm radio.  I was even tempted to order it from Iceland and have it shipped to the US.  Believe me when I say that purchasing this album will be your purchase of the year.<br /><br />From up-tempo songs to slower ballads, this album is so well-rounded it's unbelievable.  The lyrics are beautiful, the melodies and harmonies seem to flow independent of one another, and the instrumental portions add another key component to several songs.  I completely agree with one of the previous reviewers about the way the two lead vocals weave their voices in and out of several songs.  \\"Mountain Sound\\" and \\"Slow and Steady\\" were not previously released and were added to this album, and I believe Mountain Sound could be a radio hit within weeks.  The band really seems to pour every ounce of themselves into this album, and it did not go unnoticed by this listener.<br /><br />And just to add, I saw one of their live shows in Philadelphia during their small US/Canada tour, and if you ever have a chance to see them live, I highly recommend it.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|I love this movie! It was received from Amazon in perfect condition, as if I just bought it from the store. The movie itself- awesome, it drew me in just like the first two installments. If you love paranormal movies this is a must have to add to your collection!!!
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I own the first three seasons and I can watch them over and over again. I was really disappointed when CBS cancelled the show. I loved Professor Paine and was disappointed when they replaced him with Eli. I cried when Andrea died and when Jim died in the fourth season. I've loved Jennifer Love Hewitt ever since she was in I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and I fell in love with this show. I watched it every Friday night. I want to get the fourth and fifth season and it will be complete. I also have the Ghost Whisperer Games that I love to play. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a beautiful and talented actress and hope she makes it in these shows that she's doing now. I hope that CBS will put the show back on the air. They have made a major mistake in cancelling it. Maybe all of Ghost Whisperer fans can get CBS to put it back on.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Belatedly, I am struggling my way through this year's Oscar batch. I always knew that I could not possibly support a horse story for best movie. I don't like horses. They don't like me. I don't know what came first.<br />Anyway, given these starting handicaps, I was amazingly moved by this piece of conventional mind candy. The cinematography is top notch, expectedly. The visual strength of some scenes overcomes my little inner man's protests: this is kitsch, man! He says without much conviction that he can make me listen.<br /><br />Albert, a teen in Devon, raises a horse and they become best friends, on a struggling farm. Against all odds, the horse even agrees to pull the plough. Alas, dad drinks and needs to sell the horse to pay the rent. Horse ends up in English cavallery, then WW1 starts, the Brits attack a German position on horse back (outrageous idea), horse gets confiscated by the huns, stolen by a deserter, briefly repossessed by a French farmer's teen granddaughter, confiscated again by the huns, coerced into forced labor pulling artillery.<br />In the meantime, Albert has grown up and is a trench soldier. No more of the story now, to avoid spoliers.<br /><br />The mightiest scene in the film is when the horse, running away in panic, after a cannon has hit near him, gets stuck in the barbed wire between the trenches; an English and a German soldier come out of their respective trenches and cut the horse free. Then they toss a coin for ownership. A stroke of genius in war romantics.
B004N6369Y|1.0|You'll notice the ratings on Hotel Vendome are at the extremes: 5 stars or 1 star, with few in between.<br /><br />What's nice about this book is that if you're into wishful thinking, you can dream yourself as a filthy rich little girl with free reign over a hotel that is as wonderful as you can imagine it to be. If you wish you were Paris Hilton but hate her for being a spoiled brat, you have the pleasure of reading about a similar spoiled brat with good manners (mostly), who decided to be useful to her father, as opposed to the Hilton life of celebrity.<br /><br />Another thing that's nice about this book is that if you're working through a divorce and hope to re-marry, it's a feel-good novel that will give you hope in the form of two estranged lovers reuniting in the rain. It also reinforces family bonds. The word \\"love\\" or \\"lovely\\" occurs 135 times in the novel. Lots of love.<br /><br />The things that hook people on this book are what they were able to imagine, specifically idyllic circumstances and happy endings.<br /><br />Fortunately for those folks, you WILL be imagining a great deal, because Danielle Steele doesn't make the slightest effort to describe anything to you. She tells you it's beautiful and that is that. If you were to do a word search on this book, the word \\"beautiful\\" would probably be 1% of the word count. I've seen it four times on one page. What kind of sloppy author and merciful editor allows an abstract adjective like \\"beautiful\\" to characterize almost everything in their book?<br /><br />The book itself is horrendously written. There isn't the least trace of suspense or excitement. The environments lack lustre, primarily because of the reason I put forth before--the author overuses abstract adjectives like \\"perfect\\", \\"ideal\\", and \\"beautiful\\". Worse, the entire story is narrated in an expository, descriptive style that you would expect in epilogues or introductions, NOT in the body of a novel. The few episodes of dialogue seem more like an afterthought than the backbone of the story, leading to a plodding plot that as a reader, I couldn't wait to get over with. It was fairly difficult to tell when the meandering, pointless story was going to end.<br /><br />It's a boring, badly written book that should have been rejected prior to publishing. I'm sorry I wasted $11 and my time on it. I made the mistake of thinking this was a good author because of her popularity, but now I'll never read another Danielle Steel book. I'd rather read 5th graders' creative writing.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Lawrence Olivier made a film with Marilyn Monroe, in 1957. It didn't work so well. Her next movie was Some Like It Hot.<br />A young man on the set, Colin, had a brief friendship with her and wrote a memoir about it.<br />English professionalism clashes with American star cult. Or maybe: English prima donna has trouble accepting little girl tantrums from American cash cow.<br />In Colin's words: he was a great actor who wanted to be a star, while she was a star who wanted to be a great actress.<br />In Olivier's: I tried hard to change her but she remained the same despite me.<br /><br />Michelle Williams does a credible job in her mission impossible impersonating the woman who struggled with being Marilyn.<br />Branagh is a plausible Olivier.<br />Henry James might have been rather interested.<br />A nice little movie.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|As another reviewer noted this app is not created by Google, but you get two choices for signing into your Google reader account with it.  You can input your account info into the app itself or you can request that the app take you directly to Google for authorization instead.  I chose the latter route and had no trouble being logged into my gReader.<br /><br />I am thrilled to have this as I had forgotten how many good sites I have on my Google Reader because I so rarely ever checked it on my computer any more.  It is so easy to check it and read whichever posts I want to follow up on using the gReader app on my Kindle Fire so I check it several times a day and am catching all kinds of things that give me either laughs or useful information now that I had been missing by often going weeks (or longer) without checking my Google Reader on my desktop.<br /><br />(I have carpal tunnel so using the mouse on my desktop is painful.  Using my Fire does not hurt at all, so by installing apps like gReader on my Fire, I can now easily and quickly and without exacerbating my wrist pain, do many things I had begun to dread doing on the desktop using a mouse.  Just putting this additional note in for those of you who may also be avoiding a lot of things on your PC due to carpal tunnel.)<br /><br />I definitely recommend this app for anyone who likes to have all of their blogs and web sites they want to keep up on in in one handy place.  The gReader gives you a blurb with enough data on each one to decide if you want to do an additional tap to get the full update from the blogs and sites you are tracking.  If you tap it for the additional information, it is presented to you in a very easy to read format.
B000068OCS|5.0|A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Purchase was exactly as shown.  Excellent brand new Blu-Ray.  Show was beautiful<br />and just wonderful as originally presented on PBS.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It took off to a great start in the first book, keeping you on the edge of your seat. In the second book they also have a lot of exciting times and cool characters, but you start to realized that Katniss is just like every other selfish, attractive, fickle girl. She uses 2 guys as long as humanly possible and hurts them both as much as possible. The nice guys gets hurt the most of course. (This is super realistic by the way, so I have to respect the realism. The author doesn't create an unrealistic girl.) She kisses and cuddles them both like its nothing and then goes back and forth between wanting them both, giving them nothing, or wanting them dead. Dumb girl. The third book is not very exciting and kind of drags for me a bit, but honestly that was because I had begun to dislike the main character so much I just want the story to end. For folks who want to respect the character of the main character, this isn't your book. But if you want a well planned, well-written story with a very real, fallible main character this is your story.<br /><br />Peeta, by the way, is an awesome, stand-up dude. Always honest, always kind, always cool. A great character. Someone you can really root for. I just think He deserves much better.<br /><br />Despite my disliking the main character, it was well written and edited. A bit gorey for my taste in certain parts. I appreciate the lack of sexually explicit content, though there a bunch of nudity. Katniss is such a well developed character by the end of the series that I'm positive I couldn't stand her in real life. But, that just shows that the author did a good job of bringing a character to life.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I bought the trilogy because of the savings and I wish I had only bought the first in the series.<br /><br />This eBook is edited well.<br /><br />The first book starts out pretty strong but quickly began to lose me. The author takes a strong willed, lonely huntress and turns her into a puppet for opposing forces. The plot was ultimately a let down as well as the treatment of the heroine. There was a lot, a lot, of focus on make up crews and posing for cameras which seemed to replace any actual story line...<br /><br />The second and third book felt rushed and anemic. They had a tacked on feel that seemed like the author needed to reach a deadline to fulfill a contract.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game/app is way too short.It is super easy and really boring. After playing a different app called 'The Lost City'', which was made by the same people, I was even more disappointed by this app. if you want a good mystery app, you should get The Lost City by fire maple games.

0385523912|5.0|While this book can be read as a history that does not present a message or lesson, after reading it I was left with questions. The first question was: How are her subjects doing, three years later? The next question was: This suffering is not in the past, it is NOW, and is there anything I can do? I want to help North Koreans defect, I want to help them succeed after they escape, and I want to help the North Koreans who are still trapped in their failed and abusive state.<br /><br />I did some searching around and I found Demick's web page[...], and clicking on the links section I saw that she had several interesting links, among them [...] It seems to fit the bill of what I am looking for, but they aren't on Guidestar.com or Charitynavigator.com yet.<br /><br />I will most likely donate to this group anyway, but I would appreciate if other reviewers have advice on how to help.<br /><br />[edit] Oh, it looks like the links were removed. Anyway, Google \\"Nothing to Envy\\" and Demick's page will pop up. Click on her links page and you will see a link to a Japanese citizen's group that focuses on helping N. Korean defectors. The point is, reading this book should not be an intellectual exercise. It should be a call to action.

B00005N6KG|2.0|I like ear buds, but when I workout it seems like as I sweat I always have to adjust and push them back in, so I wanted to buy headphones that would stay in place. With the headband piece, this set stays in place, but the in-ear portion doesn't fit without discomfort.  I can get them close enough to my ears that I can faintly hear the music or tv, but not well enough to leave them like that for my entire workout.  Or I can push them into my ear for a better fit, but they are hard plastic so they hurt.  They are well made, the sound is great, and the head piece adjusts easily, but I ended up switching back to my ear buds because I don't have to mess with them as much as these.  Really disappointed.  Glad I didn't pay too much.
0375842209|5.0|Perhaps it is a book aimed at teenagers, yet this story  deals with themes that can easily satisfy an adult reader. I read it as a tale of friendship in the face of adversities. The prose is poetic without being inaccessible, the characters fully formed, the relationships they share are credible yet surprising, the images powerful - all these elements create a unique, moving book. This is a holocaust story unlike any others I've read. My advice to the reader is to give this book the chance to conquer you - which will happen as soon as you realize who's telling the tale.
0062068423|4.0|The book is very long and needs concentration to follow all the characters. Also the action keeps<br />switching back and forth in time from the '40s to the present.<br />It turns out that some Norwegians were helping the German army fight the Russians during the 1940s.<br />People were killed and dead bodies were misidentified. Some of the men held grudges against people back home who collaborated or who failed to appreciate the sacrifices they had made. There is a<br />powerful revenge motive at work. By the end of the book we eventually find out who is really who<br />and why a dying man poisons a tree and buys a sniper rifle.
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|I bought this adapter to connect my Macbook Air to my HDTV.  The picture is good enough (not perfectly crisp but not degraded so much that is upsets me).  I couldn't figure out how to get the sound to work at first, but S. Friedman suggested:<br /><br />Have you made sure to change your audio output setting from the 'sound' pane in system preferences? OS X generally does this on its own but sometimes will need to be done manually. Select the output option that describes the make/model of your hdtv or receiver, whichever the hdmi cable is connected to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great lil time waster. perfect for a quick game on those nights you cant sleep or waiting for someone or in the waiting room.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Very impressed with the customer service!! My videos were delivered quickly so I was very pleased with that.  Unfortunately one of the discs had an imperfection in it that caused it to freeze when being played.  I contacted this vendor and the very next day I received a reply email to inform me that I had a new set of DVDs on their way. Needless to say I am very pleased and will order from this vendor again!!!!
B00104GSRE|4.0|The vinyl album I received was of a lesser quality as advertised.  Both the quality of the disk and cover were less than expected.  Upon notifying the seller of this, they agreed to reduce the sale price by 25%.  Although disappointed, their concern and price reduction helped to rectify the situation.  Very friendly to deal with.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. It feels like I am listening to all her previous 11 albums with a new twist. There is a song for every mood and many of the songs are very personal to her break up. I am glad she is sharing that with her fans.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Alternate title for this review: \\"Twilight with BDSM Mortals\\"<br /><br />\I read all of the Twilight books knowing that they were generally junk food literature but just as when you eat junkfood, you don't care because it tastes good and fulfills some sugary/fattening need. If Twilight is M&M's, then these books are probably high-end chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />E.L. James was inspired by Twilight to write something similiar but better. She definitely accomplished that in regard to the general plot and making the \\"Edward\\" character (Christian Grey) much more interesting and complex. I couldn't put this book down because I, like the narrator, Ana, couldn't wait to be in his prescence again. Christian Grey makes this novel a page-turner and my only wish is that James could have improved more on the \\"Bella\\" character of Ana. She's awkward, she bites her lip a lot (much like Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella in the Twilight movies), and the descriptions of her \\"inner Goddess\\" get really old and annoying. I'm still left wondering why he chose her to fall in love with.<br /><br />I already purchased the second book in the series to read and while I hope they continue to evolve into say, Gourmet Creme<br />Brulee', I'm okay with the chocolate chip cookies for now. If you want to escape into a world where some awkward virginal girl becomes the inexplicable love of a brooding, tormented \\"Adonis,\\" save some calories and opt for this book instead of Mrs. Fields.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|An awesome movie, full of suspense and intense action.  Watch it!!  You won't regret it!!  I loved every minute of it.
006097625X|5.0|This is a great book. Scott McCloud has really capture the essence of how we communicate through visuals in a sequential format.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for designers wanting to learn the how of visual communication. The content is layed out very clearly and is easy to understand.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|I first heard of TS and the New Orleans band on a NPR interview almost 2 years ago and me and family and friends have seen him live about 5 times since. That was just based on the strength of \\"Backatown\\" and each performance was an all out party!!<br />They have done it again with \\"For True!\\". I didn't think it was possible. Great fun, infectious real music.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I believe their are certain books that make what I call the life read  list. If you love reading you'll enjoy many stories from many genres but this was the kind of story that stays with you long after the final words are read. A journey that felt very authentic and was as emotional as you could allow yourself to imagine. I loved the strength in the characters and the truth in their entwining worlds. Do yourself a favour, buy the book, lock yourself away and don't come out until the puffy eyes subside.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Anyone who likes acoustic sounds and great song-writing should buy this album.  It's been years since I found an album I can listen to as frequently as this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i really feel like I have the real kindle with this app. I love it.... the large print allows me to read it anytime on the go, and fit right into my pocket.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Adding new characters without knowing what happen to the ones I know was annoying.  Did Jon die?  How can those dragons help win the war if they burn and eat everything? Will there be another book to clear somethings up?
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I personally loved this book.<br />Our book club is reviewing this book on April 16, so I will send a picture of our club (if they all agree) and some of our thoughts.<br />Cheers, Linda
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Dune has so many levels to it that even after 30+ readings, I still find some new angle, something new, each time I read it. The way this book blends religion, politics, strategy, honor, culture, and family is absolutely masterful. Neither of the movies have come close to doing it justice. If you've seen the movies and didn't like them, just forget the movies. Read the books. Some say they have to slog through the first few pages, but those pages set the stage of a noble family constantly in preparation for war or assassination attempts.<br /><br />There are some quotes from the books that I think of often in daily life. \\"We exist only to serve,\\" as the Bene Gesserit saying goes - and often said between gritted teeth. \\"Beginnings are such delicate times.\\" Or that the best leaders serve the best coffee hearth.<br /><br />This book ought to be required reading for political science or comparitive religion majors.
0345803485|5.0|Not \\"fine literature\\" and terribly repetitive, but it doesn't matter...you'll be drawn in and spellbound about 10 pages in...loved this trilogy..can't imagine them making a movie of it, but the rights have been sold already...who could ever play Christian Grey?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really has fun games on it<br />and some of them are hard like this frog game which you got to get as many toys with its tongue

B004UID2LC|3.0|its ok. I think it would have been better if you could watch videos at youtube. I. wish my kindle works good
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I enjoyed the continued story, but I found myself readily setting this book aside to do other more interesting activities. I was only invested in this Book because of the overall story and often felt it was progressing far to slowly.  It could have been half the length and progressed the story just as far.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Personally, I think G5 has the best apps. This is one of them. Unfortunately, it is a lot of maintenance and you really have to spend your money wisely. Overall,  for a free game,  it 's awesome. Personally one of my favorites!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I tried to read this book once before...  and I didn't like it, I wasn't interested in dystopian novels and I didn't like that all the characters had such bizarre names.  So I closed the book and let it go.  When the movie came out and was a huge success I decided I wanted to read it and see the movie, I read about 6 chapters before going to the movie and the writing was really good, after seeing the movie I went home to finish the book.  It did not disappoint.  In fact it had me buying book 2 immediately after and now I'm halfway through it.<br /><br />There isn't much to add to other reviews because everything has been said.  Reading the book at the same time as watching the movie I think they did an excellent adaptation of the story and Suzanne Collins has a beautiful style of writing even when it's something as sad and serious as The Hunger Games. What a creative idea.  This book is just so full of imagination and you can tell she put so much into writing it.  Definitely a 5 star and it's no wonder she's the next big thing in book and media headlines!
0439023513|3.0|This is not a complete review.  Just a thought about the book within its genre.<br /><br />As you read this, particularly if you are a fan of dystopic science fiction, you need to constantly remind yourself this is a Young Adult book.  Over and over you need to remind yourself.  Otherwise it's intolerable.<br /><br />But here's where the author deserves some credit (semi-spoiler alert): there's not a happy ending.  And the new regime is merely another manifestation of the old.  So the author sticks to the theme of, \\"Humans are flawed, and we substitute one devil for another.\\"  I think Vonnegut would give Collins credit for that at least.<br /><br />In fact, when I finished I was astonished that any publisher picked this up because there's no neat and tidy solution.  So kudos to Collins, the editors, and the publisher for not pandering to the audience with sophomoric resolutions.<br /><br />To summarize, fans of the genre should skip this book.  But at least be happy that there's a palatable and popular YA science fiction book that appeals to the masses and might get them reading some of the better books out there.<br /><br />If you aren't a fan of the genre, you should read this but be aware that this genre is used to take a critical sociological examination of society and humanity in general.  And the conclusion is not usually positive.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a great game! Download it now! My only disapointment is that it doesn't have updates as much as Angry Birds Seasons...........
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The fact that I have the movie, and much of the \\"skinny\\" on it's making is just an added bonus. This movie has it ALL! It's appealing at nearly all genre levels, suspense, drama, romance, action......just movie making on an INCREDIBLE level.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hesitated a long time before buying 50 Shades of Grey. I read tons of great reviews and almost as many bad reviews, but when I read that E. L. James was offered 4 million dollars plus for the movie rights, I caved.<br /><br />Erotica is not anywhere near the top of my list of favorites, neither is pure romantic fiction. That being said, I have to own up to loving all kinds of novels including the Twilight series, Hunger Games, Misery, The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Kushiel's Dart, and Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer. So as you can see, I'm all over the place.<br /><br />Down to the nitty gritty. I have to confess; I loved 50 Shades of Grey. Just as I did in Twilight, I could easily identify with someone who felt awkward, clumsy, unattractive,and never quite fitting in - a square peg in a round hole. Add a gorgeous, wealthy, more than slightly twisted stalker, and I'm there. Okay, so maybe I'm a little twisted too. Who knew?<br /><br />I enjoyed how both Ana's and Christian's characters developed as their relationship grew and changed as well. I am giving 50 Shades of Grey 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5 only because it ended with a cliff hanger. I like novels to be stand alone even when they are part of a series. It's just my thing. I will most likely buy the other two in the series. Wait, who am I kidding? Of course I'll buy the next two! They are just a click away on my Kindle.
1594203334|5.0|I find that the way children are being raised in America today are quite different from the way I was raise 40 years ago.  Today, many American parents approach their children through constant reasoning, scant discipline and almost no boundary setting.  Consequently, they have little or no time to engage in adult behaviors with other adults.  This book was a refreshing read with common sense ideas about maintaining balance and not letting your children be your entire life.
B003Q7B78S|5.0|Fast delivery and great value.<br />Perfect condition.<br />I was very happy with the packaging the DVD was shipped in.<br />The movie seemed brand new when it arrived.<br />I had no problems from the seller regarding a last second shipping address change.<br />The DVD arrived at the correct location on time.
1416914285|3.0|I won't summarize the plot..many people have done that on here before and better than I could. I just had to chime in and say that once again I don't get all the hype. I am 28 and have read many YA novels that I quite enjoyed. Harry Potter of course, I enjoyed the Wicked Lovely series for pure entertainment, Hunger Games was really well done IMHO, and there were many other random YA books (L.J. Smith, Christopher Pike, Rachel Meade)just to name a couple of authors. So even as an adult, I can enjoy YA books. I just finished Game of Thrones and was looking for something lighter when I finally caved to the hype and picked up City of Bones. I had heard so much good about the series I thought...why not? I will give it a go despite the fact I have been let down by over hyped books before, i.e. Twilight.<br /><br />I found the book to be mediocre. It wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't very good. There wasn't really gratuitous grammar errors or glaring potholes or anything that stood out as bad writing. But there was an overwhelming sense of deja vu. It was almost as if I had read this book before. It wasn't until I read another's review that it clicked...yep, it was Harry Potter rehashed. I think if Harry Potter had never been written I would have enjoyed this book a bit more. As it was it felt overwhelmingly predictable.<br /><br />My major problem came in the form of Jace. He just wasn't likable. At all. I like flawed characters. I even love a good anti-hero. Half the time I am rooting for the villain. I am always lusting after the bad guys...Some of my fav characters from movies and books are the anti-hero/villains..Jericho Barrons from the Fever series, Magneto from X-Men:First Class, Loki from Thor, Irial from the Wicked Lovely series, Halcyon from the Mona Lisa series, Sephiroth from FFVII...I love a bad boy. But more than that I love a compelling, complex character. Bring on the coldness, the aloofness, the daddy/mommy issues, the \\"i'll hurt you before you hurt me\\" attitude, the darkness that is broken only by the strength, compassion, and love of a strong, independent woman. But Clary felt too Mary Sue-ish and Jace felt to contrived. He never felt bad enough to be bad and to jerk-ish to be good. Secondary characters were flat as well and the plot was weak in a been there done that kinda way.<br /><br />I guess overall it was a lukewarm read for me. I won't be continuing with the series but it wasn't all bad. I was mildly entertained..but there are far better YA books out there to read. I certainly don't get the hype surrounding this series but then again, and at the risk of offending multitudes of people, Twilight made it obvious that a book does not have to be good to become obscenely popular.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Long awaited and now a favorite! Haven't stopped listening since I received it. Angry and hopeful, stirs the emotions, gets the heart pumping.
0385504225|5.0|This was a tough book to put down. I live in the DC area so that added some to my interest.  I knew nothing about the Mason's, though my father was on in a small town in upstate NY.  I found the story line very interesting and found myself at the end asking myself how much of what i read was based on fact and what was total fantasy.

B003B02O14|3.0|For the most part, a very interesting read.  Grisham's style is undeniably his own, with this book being no exception.  Even with all the twists and turns, the story drags in part and becomes very predictable. Suzanne Seaver, Houston, TX

B001EN71HC|5.0|Mike Myers' witty comedy makes these movies shine. From Austin to Dr. Evil, Mike Myers makes these characters so believable and funny. Add in a great cast of characters and this is a great set. Spy Who Shagged Me is my fav!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is ok. The theme of buying all the new games you want by getting points by completing. The ones you already have.
B006362ZR6|5.0|When The Fray announced that they were releasing a new album, I was beyond excited.  I mean, they ARE my favorite band:)  And, I will be the first to say that this album does not disappoint.  I am in love with songs such as 'Heartbeat' 'Run for Your Life' and 'Munich'.  I am so excited The Fray is back, and if you haven't already: BUY THIS CD!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have seen your comments about why is there a NER, well its because that's the company that made it. also is a fun game. like Mario.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|I just loved this book as it held my interest from the first page I turned. Reading it on my iPad for the first also added to the experience. I would have to rate the book as one of my favorites and one I have recommended to all my friends.

B001FB55H6|1.0|I'll be honest.  I was intrigued by this film from the opening credits.  Everything seemed like it was going to make an interesting viewing, but alas that turned out not to be the case.  As I mentioned, the opening credits fascinated me in a way, because they presented us with an alternate reality that was going to inhabit the film.  Music, images, editing...everything was going well, and then the movie started.  This is the third film by Zack Snyder, and the only one I actually finished watching or rather forced myself to finish watching, hoping there's some sort of a point to it all.  If you haven't guessed it by now, the answer is NO!  THERE IS NO POINT!  This is a very long, boring slog of a movie, that is shot like a slow-mo music video.  The film is shot in dark and murky colors, forcing me to squint quite a bit in order to make out what's happening on screen.  Overuse of slow motion, incoherent plotting, endless special effects and odd musical design of this picture contributed to it's failure, but not as much as the excessive violence.  At a certain point, my brain shut down on trying to figure out what's going on, and began to dread the next blood soaked set piece.  I have nothing against violence in films, however, I hate it when it's excessive.  Numerous limbs are broken, heads split, faces bitten off and arms cut off by a circular saw.  Overall, this film is full of needless excesses, which do not, I repeat, do not come together as a coherent whole.<br /><br />I walked out on Snyder's remake of Dawn Of The Dead, because of it's violence, checked out of his 300, about 20 minutes into it, because of it's overkill of special effects, which should have prepared me for Watchmen.  He does have a strong visual sense, but goes way overboard with it.  Overall, this is a terrible waste of time that will leave you angry and depressed. There's nothing to be gained here, so skip Watchmen and rent or buy something worth your while.  V for Vendetta, perhaps?
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Extremely pleased with this flash.  Had limited expectations based on previous reviews and the low cost of the unit.  Wanted a flash that would cycle faster than my onboard camera flash.  Didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Literature claimed that with rechargeable batteries you could expect a 2.5 sec cycle.  With fresh batteries, I found the flash cycles almost immediately.  Some delay as batteries discharge, but cycle still seems faster than the promised 2.5 sec.  Definitely use the NiHM rechargeable batteries.  Beyond that, I was pleased with how well the bounce flash has performed.  As a relative novice, I didn't any experience with bounce flashes and did not understand their value.  Started using the bounce almost by accident and it has made me a much better photographer!  Like the quality of the flash and it's case.  Especially like the compact size.  Very good value.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You can definitely tell the book is written for teens, but its a great read even for someone in their late 20s!
B0012YYZYK|5.0|excellent dvd..they never seen so close up, like the old tapes......big zeppelin fan great dvd<br />a must have, order it today you won't be disappointed.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|this app is fun and good but I would not wort five I think it needs a story to go with it thanks
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I can't say enough about this album that hasn't already been said and when I saw the band it was on this tour in Atlanta at the Lakewood Amphitheater. I was totally blown away by Amy Lee's performance having at that time no knowledge that she was an accomplished pianist. This is the Evanescence I will always remember for the rest of my life. Awesome.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this book to come out. And like the others of the serie, it is captivating. I can't wait for more. But if Goerge Martin take that long again for the next book it will drive me crazy! :)<br />I would recommend this books to anyone: the fantasy is great and the English as well ( which is not always true in this genre)<br />RB
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I swear this woman has lungs of steel because I have never heard a woman with more power in her lungs not to mention this band can freakin rock. This is a little old school in a good way. I saw them in concert and hadn't heard of them but by the end of the show I had bought a cd and was lucky enough to get it autographed by the whole band. I am looking forward to more of this amazing band.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. it is AWESOME. this game is the bomb. I love logic puzzles.best game ever. thank you whoever made this game.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Fast and smooth transaction all the way.  One of the best movies I have in my inventory.  Will watch again and again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a fan of romance novels as a rule, but when a good friend suggested I branch out with this novel, I hesitantly went for it. Trying to put out of my mind it was about bondage and dominance lifestyles was another matter. I began reading and was pleasantly surprised. So much so I have now ordered the other books. This isn't the usual heavy reading I indulge in, and its not for educational purposes. It's just for fun. Kind of like watching super hero movies. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I love this calendar app. With the great features its definitely a daily driver. Onlu issues I've noticed so far are:<br /><br />1. Once the color of &quot;today&quot; is set, it worked for a short time and now it just doesn't show up at all, all the colors for weekends and today too. Great feature and looking forward to it working again.<br /><br />2. When doing a search for events, if the search button is pressed twice or more on the same search, the results are duplicated. But nevertheless I love the search option.<br /><br />These two minor bugs should not deter you from this app, its a wonderful feature-rich replacement measures above and beyond what's included in android's os. I would say the only default calendar that reaches a not-so-close second to this one is htc's default calendar and blackberry's too.
B001L4NJIO|5.0|I own the Blu-ray of this show. The video and audio quality are great! I don't own a surround system, so I am listening in stereo HD. I laugh at some of the negative reviews simply due to the fact that the audio IS mixed well.<br /><br />I grew up being a huge police fan (I'm a drummer), but never saw them live back in the 80's. When I heard about the reunion I was happy but didn't feel the need to go see them since I thought they wouldn't be as good. That was a mistake. Yeah, they play the songs with different arrangements and Sting does sing differently than he did back in the day, but IT WORKS! They aren't in their 30's anymore but they still have the chops and musicality to pull it off successfully. It does bum me out that they will never tour again, but I'll get over that. This Blu-ray is a great document of their show.<br /><br />Really one of the only bands that can rearrange their songs and they still kick ass!<br /><br />Highly recommend!<br />xoxo
B006X5L6VS|5.0|this is a great app it just cant work with the kindle (fire).tu should get this app if you are a space freak like me just go to the aneroid store or best buy so you can ajust it to your location and then tu can get started!!!!!!;)

068485743X|5.0|As an aspiring new author I have been totally frustrated by the agents and the publishing industry as a whole who are only interested in representing proven authors with names that will sell automatically with no marketing effort required on the publishers behalf.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have not been a YA in a very long time but I began reading books in this genre as a way of screening books that have received good reviews  before suggesting them for my daughter.<br />Teen fiction seems to be lumped into Teen fiction or YA fiction these days and that is a huge age range.<br />Anyway, I was first introduced to John Green's work when I read his collaboration in Will Grayson, Will Grayson.I loved that book.<br /> I have since read Looking for Alaska and now The Fault in Our Stars.<br />When I read the summary for this most recent novel, I wanted to read it but I also didn't want to read it. The idea of it made me anxious.<br /> Once I started, the characters drew me in right away and I couldn't put it down.<br />If you told me I would laugh out loud occassionaly while reading a book about teens with cancer, I would never have believed it. But John Green took you into the minds of these teens and how they expressed themselves with anger, humor and honesty as they dealt with their conditions; often more realistically than those of us on the outside looking in.<br />I laughed, I cried, I got pissed and really got thinking about life and loss.<br />This novel is BRILLIANT!<br />Augustus and Hazel rock!

B001R4KQDE|5.0|As I stated with other Robert Rodriguez films, this was bad-ass cops, low-lifes & babes. Frank Miller's graphic novels come to vivid life, until Rodriguez and Miller's hands. Some scenes were lifted right off of the page. A violent, sexy wild ride, with lots of humor. The Blu-ray finally is the definitive version of a now cult-classic!

0984999302|5.0|I received your new book \\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" the day I was scheduled to go give a talk to a PMI group in Marin about the importance of stakeholder analysis to product development. As my office manager drove, I flipped through your book. I chuckled with delight at your 2 step process! Step #1 - customer discovery. Step #2 - customer validation. Excellent! So true. That evening I waved your book feverishly about the room as I ranted about the importance of customer-centric product development, and the pitfalls of forgetting the customer. Lately people have been talking a lot about Steve Jobs. Naturally I am in awe of what both of you \\"Steves\\" have accomplished, but I favor your approach in spite of his results because it leads to more predictable and repeatable successes, and doesn't require that a person be a genius to succeed. A master chef doesn't need a cookbook, but a competent cook can prepare gourmet meals by following a good step-by-step recipe. Being a genius isn't a possibility for many of us. Thanks for making a recipe for the rest of us, Steve!

B004SYP5WC|4.0|Picked it up as the FAOTD. So far I'm very pleased with it. My only suggestion is there needs to be the option for quarterly recurrence and I'd like to be able to set the reminder time. Mine seem to come up at about 7 am but I don't sit down to pay bills until the evening. So I have to hope I don't accidentally dismiss the reminder all day. Otherwise it's a very handy little app.

B00190N4E4|4.0|The screenplay of Gandhi is available as a published book. The film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming Gandhi's complex life story:<br />\\"  No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man... \\"<br /><br />The film begins with Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948,[5]:18-21 and his funeral.[5]:15-18 After an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. One of these visitors--Nathuram Godse--shoots him point blank in the chest. Gandhi exclaims, \\"Oh, God!\\" (\\"H' Ram!\\" historically), and then falls dead. The film then cuts to a huge procession at his funeral, which is attended by dignitaries from around the world.<br /><br />The early life of Gandhi is not depicted in the film. Instead, the story flashes back 55 years to a life-changing event: in 1893, the 24-year-old Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a ticket. Realizing the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognizing some rights for Indians.<br /><br />After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence (Swaraj, Quit India) from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. After World War II[9] Britain finally grants Indian independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops.<br /><br />The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless.<br /><br />Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom assassinates him in a scene at the end of the film that recalls the opening.<br /><br />As Godse shoots Gandhi, the film fades to black and Gandhi is heard in a voice over, saying \\"Oh God\\". The audience then sees Gandhi's cremation; the film ending with a scene of Gandhi's ashes being scattered on the holy Ganga. It was Richard Attenborough's lifelong dream to bring the life story of Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi to the screen. When it finally reached fruition in 1982, the 188-minute, Oscar-winning Gandhi was one of the most exhaustively thorough biopics ever made. The film begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), a British-trained lawyer, forsakes all worldly possessions to take up the cause of Indian independence. Faced with armed resistance from the British government, Gandhi adopts a policy of\\"passive resistance,\\" endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed. In the horrendous \\"slaughter\\" sequence, more extras appear on screen than in any previous historical epic.\\"passive resistance,\\" endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed.

This was a big mistake as I gained four pounds and had to start over with the attack phase.  So, be careful with any splurges.  I was surprised that I was never hungry, tired or irritable  on this diet.  I am looking forward to the cruise  phase.  I believe I will be able to follow this diet for life.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Very exciting and great to read. Would recamend this book to anyone who love adventerous stories. Really can't wait for the movie.
0385495323|4.0|I ordered this book, and it came in the mail. You can read it, or use it as a weight to make sure things don't blow around. It's not too heavy so you can conveniently carry it around in a bag, but be advised it cannot fit in a regular sized pocket. The jacket is nice, slightly grippy, so it's easier to hold it if that's what you want to do with it, or throw it, if you decide to do that. I didn't try tasting it. It is not especially colorful but the outside looks alluring. All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase of this book.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|What a great movie.  My girlfriend is quite a bit younger and had never seen it.  She was skeptical at first, but really enjoyed it as well.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|Many people like me who find it a hassle to get to the gym frequently and want to be able to train independently of other people to meet our goals have taken up bodyweight training.  There are a number of good programs available, but with some minor reservations, I think this is one of the best I've seen all around.  I was very impressed with the knowledge and experience the author seems to have and the practicality and directness of his methods.  This is a very solid bodyweight training manual in general.  The hook is a military theme: the author spends a lot of time talking about how important fitness is to elite military and how he has so much experience helping to train elite military to be as fit as possible with minimum time and energy.  The main problem a few people will have with this program is that there is a lot of variety here and some fairly tricky protocols, and some novices to bodyweight training may find it a little much to learn new timing methods, rep schemes, and exercises all at once.  There are similarly themed programs for example that get initially very much the same results (I think) with only two or three general purpose exercises done the same way every time. For some people that might be a more appropriate start, especialy if they were doing nothing before.  Lauren's novice routines begin with ladders that rapidly begin incorporating a number of different exercises. A very workable scheme physically but I suspect some will be overwhelmed by it just from a new learning and habit formation perspective.<br /><br />If you're not too familiar with bodyweight training, and you like the military theme, I think you will find this a very motivational book with great starting routines, easy to perform exercises with a lot of variety, only household items required for equipment, and good progression schemes.  You will probably find the mixing of protocols and the variety of exercises very confusing if you are a novice to this kind of training, and while he provides recommended workouts for you, the protocols can still be a bit confusing.  In particular, Lauren makes heavy use of \\"ladders\\" at some points, and these are a powerful tool for building up to many repetitions in an exercise but they can be tough to do properly.  Ladders are a way of varying the number of repetitions to do in each set, building from lower to higher repetitions and them back down again, as with simple pyramids.<br /><br />The difference that makes the beginner routines in this book trickier than most is that Lauren's ladders require you to keep track of how long each set takes and then to rest that amount of time.  I find that's a very difficult thing to be doing while you're trying to figure out the rest of the details of the workout.  The only way it becomes practical for novices I think is if they use the iPad application associated with the program, which has a built in timer that tells you what to do and when for each workout.  It's a great resource if you have an iPad and you don't mind keeping it with you during your workout and telling it when you've completed each set.<br /><br />Advanced bodyweight trainers will still find some interesting things in this book, such as Lauren's well thought out progression scheme, his clever exercise variations, and his use of periodization and varying protocols to help each block build on the previous one to continue building fitness in different dimensions all year round.  Even for advanced people, I strongly recommend the associated iPad app, to help track workouts and figure out some of the trickier protocols in the beginning.<br /><br />If you're a fan of minimalism in exercise, and if you want to be able to train without a gym, I think this book and the associated application are great resources.  There are a lot of ideas here you can work into other training programs easily and there are also many specific routines you can use if you aren't sure what to do.ile he provides recommended workouts for you, the protocols can still be a bit confusing.

B005FHXB0O|5.0|Tarantino proves once again why he's a genius.  I hadn't watched this movie in about 10 years, so wasn't sure if it was going to be as good as I had remembered.  It was even better.  Gary Oldman plays the most kick ass character, as well as Dennis Hopper and Christian Slater. Patricia Arquette is incredibly hot in this picture.  Very good all around cast.
B0073XORCY|5.0|I have now given Thick as a Brick 2 several listens.  It differs greatly from the original and is not continuous music but rather songs that run relatively seemlessly into the next.  The writing and musicianship are top knotch (no surprise there) and the songs range from complex prog to stunningly beautiful (and often sad) ballads.  While there are some winks to the motifs of the original, it is a completely new work not a lesser rehash of the classic.  Like many Tull/Ian projects, it takes a few listens to really capture and appreciate, but is well worth the effort!<br /><br />Yes - written by a biased Tull fan.
B000FC12C8|3.0|After wading through hundreds of pages (and on a Kindle it felt like about 87,000), I did get a lot of valuable information out of this book.  That said, I had to spend a week to do it and many of the concepts were still unclear.  I've heard good things about the previous edition of this book so I may check that out as well.<br /><br />A much shorter (and clearer) option is [[ASIN:B0067LZ7PY Uncle Bob's Money: Generating Income with Conservative Options Trades]]
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|Chocolat was recommended to us by a friend; we were not really aware of the movie until he mentioned how good it was. We decided to rent it and agreed if it was really bad we would just stop the movie at the point we could no longer tolerate it. We were both pleasantly surprised when almost from the beginning we were at first interested and later delighted by this movie. The movie captivated us and after watching it I went online and ordered a copy from Amazon.<br /><br />One of the nice things about rentals is the opportunity to examine before buying; sort of like a test drive in the new car your considering buying. Our test drive quickly convinced us this was a movie we would definitely want to watch again and one we would gladly add to our collection of favorites. Juliette Binoche is charming as Vianne Rocher, a single mom on a mission. Alfred Molina and Judi Dench are both perfect in their roles and as always Johnny Depp, who doesn't appear until later in the movie, adds his usual charm which is always welcome.<br /><br />This is a special movie that does not easily fit into any of the typical molds; we found it refreshing and very entertaining. I suggest you give it a try and see what you think.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a fun game and looks good on kindle fire. the only problem is that my screen is always stickey so I cant play it very well. but otherwise it is a good game. kinda fun too. if my screen worked better I would give it five stars.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|First off, I realize this is not a high end sharpener. This is for quick field sharpening and touch ups when required. I purchased this for that exact reason and I am extremely pleased with the results.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- VERY easy to use.<br />- Openings are wide enough for my combat folder - not every sharpener works for that so I am pleased.<br />- ceramic sharpeners worked perfectly on a slightly dulled blade - brought it back to very sharp within a few strokes.<br />- Carbide sharpeners took a relatively dull machete up to acceptably sharp within a couple of minutes.<br />- file sharpener took the serrated portion of my combat folder from slighly dull to razor sharp within a minute.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's quite small - be careful when using - potential to cut yourself while sharpening is real with this.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely pleased with this inexpensive and very useful field tool.
0385342063|2.0|I'm a little confused by all the five stars this book is getting. I'll start by saying I've been a big Sophie Kinsella fan since the first Shopaholic book. Becky was a bit dimwitted but she had a good-heart and you couldn't help but like her. This book doesn't have any of the same magic or draw as the original Shopaholic (I say original because after the first book you have to say, Becky grow up... how are you in this mess again?).<br /><br />Poppy could be Becky's long-lost twin sister. No, she doesn't have a shopping problem but she's every bit as good-hearted and dimwitted as Becky. And as another reviewer said, Sam is basically a Luke re-do. The entire book felt tired, drawn out and done before. It had its moments of cuteness but I didn't find myself rooting for Poppy as I did for Becky. The problem with chick lit is you know the basic premise before you start, so it's up to the writer to make it seem fresh. In this book, Kinsella fails somewhat miserably. I found myself wanting the book to be over, for Poppy to wise up, Sam to finally make a move and for everything to get wrapped up in a neat bow so I can get on with my life. On a side note, I agree with other reviewers the footnotes added nothing and were distracting.<br /><br />I get the plot isn't going to be real life. In real life, if you find a phone in the trash and the phone's owner knows - they'll either call the cops or shut the phone down. They won't let you keep it for weeks on end and expect you to forward messages. My problem with the book isn't that Poppy is using what amounts to a stolen phone and if Luke... I mean Sam... is so straight-laced then why didn't he just cut the phone off, it's the fact that the character feel played out. The storyline isn't that interesting. And there are a lot of pages where a whole lot of nothing happens. Honestly, I felt like I was reading other best-selling authors where you can tell the story from the first page because that's how all of his/her books end up.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book. If you're looking for a frothy beach read try one of her first books instead. This one is not one of her best works and seriously has me questioning whether I would read another Kinsella book (I get bored quickly of writers that lean on the same character types over and over). I'm giving it two stars because as much fault as I can find with the book, I don't hate it. A one star review for me is reserved for books that I can't get through the first chapter. I was able to finish this book although I wasn't dying to read what happened next. I honestly think this book was rushed and could have been better.
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|I love Beatles' music.  That said it is nice to sometimes hear new versions on old classics.  Across The Universe is a wonderful recreation of Beatles' music...the movie is also great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What A great story!I know that it wasn't the happy ending that I wanted but then again you cannot expect every book to have one..the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I felt the ending was rushed...I have spent 3 days reading the whole series..so yes I got effected after the ending I felt sad..it was depressing....and honestly what happened to cinna?? I know he died but please why make his death nothing????why!he was an important role in the book and we didn't hear how he died!

B003IKMR0U|1.0|A lot of my friends have told me what a great game Zombie Dice is and to satisfy the curiosity of what they were talking about, I decided to buy a copy to check it out.<br /><br />Zombie Dice is a dice game develop by Steve Jackson Games in March of 2010. The components of this game is a simple cardboard dice cup (About the same size as standard can of soda), a sheet of rules and 13 customized six-sided dice. 2 or more players may play.<br /><br />Here's the loadout: You are a zombie...<br /><br />You heard me! A Zombie! Not a cheerleader with a chainsaw, or the ex-cop who somehow manages to keep his shotgun fully loaded. You are a zombie! Have you got that yet? Good.<br /><br />Anyway, you play the role of a zombie who is patrolling your neighborhood in search of an all-you-can-eat buffet of brains. Each of the dice represents a victim and you need to score enough brain points (13 is the suggested goal, but you could always alter the number) before you get blasted with the shotguns.<br /><br />The dice come in three colors and each of three different symbols on them, which are Brains, which earn you 1 point for each one you get when you score, Footprints, who are victims that escaped your slimy grasp and need to be chased after (you reroll these ones if you decide to keep rolling) and finally Blasts, which means someone shot you and you can only take three hits in a turn.<br /><br />Green dice are easy victims (Think unlocked playground full of kids) and will have more brains than the other dice.<br /><br />Yellow dice are medium victims (Perhaps a PTA group) and will have the more 50-50 ratio with Brains, footprints and Blast symbols.<br /><br />Red dice are the victims that will be difficult to kill (U.S. Marines. Nuff said.) and will have the most Blasts. Be careful with these ones.<br /><br />Anywho... You put all the dice in the cup, give it a shake, roll three random dice (No peeking allowed!) and see what happens. If you get any brains, set them aside and score them when you decided to `stop and score'. Get any blasts and you set them aside as well, but if you get 3 then your turn is over and you lose all the points you would have gotten that turn. If you roll any footprints, then you have to reroll those dice with enough new ones to make 3 dice for that roll IF you decide to `roll some more'. Of course you could always end your turn and save the points you got, but if you decide to keep rolling, you could get more points, or risk losing it all. Sound simple? Well it should, because you're playing as a zombie and I don't think zombies can understand complexity.<br /><br />When Zombie Dice came out, it was an instant hit, and even as of this review, an expansion for Zombie Dice is in the works. This game can be fun and costs around $15. However, there are drawbacks to this game, like any other.<br /><br />One of the drawbacks about this game is that it does not include a way to keep track of all the points you've acquired in one turn. A piece of paper and pencil will be required for this, but couldn't Steve Jackson Games provide a simple counter? But then again, most gamers will have an ample supply of standard dice on them that could be used to keep score, so this decision may have had a basis.<br /><br />The dice cup is large enough to hold twice the amount of dice it comes with and seems to be a waste of space if you ask me. Steve Jackson Games could have cut the cup size in half and it still would have been acceptable, not to mention cutting the material cost down a bit to save the company money, but that's another matter.<br /><br />And finally, Zombie Dice, with the exception of the whole `You're a zombie' angle, is too much like other dice games such as Yahzee, Farkle, Toss Up! and several others I can name. The zombie role and the designs of the dice is the only thing that makes this game unique to other dice games, where as the mechanics of the game play feels more like a cheap knock off from some of the classic, and that shows a lack of originality. Essentially you roll the dice, decide to `stop and score' or `roll some more' then repeat until you score enough points to win (I've seen it done on a player's first turn) or be forced to end your turn (Also witnessed on a players first turn).<br /><br />In addition, the choice to `stop and score' or `roll some more' creates a bit of a dilemma. I have seen on numerous occasions, where the first player will roll until they get the 13 brains needed to win without getting 3 blasts. Sure it was the luck of the roll, but the fact is, is that the other players never had a chance to roll during that session and it seemed a bit unfair. If perhaps the game limited the amount of brains you could score on one turn, it may make it seem fairer for those players who haven't gotten a turn.<br /><br />I have to say that although Zombie Dice may seem like a hit to some players, I believe Steve Jackson Games could have done a lot better with this one. In my opinion, this game appeals to the more zombie fanatic gamer than it does to those of us who are not a big of fans of zombies. I feel I would have to find better entertainment elsewhere.
B005URRCUY|4.0|If you don't already own Bothers (2010) and the Black Keys 2002 album The Big Come Up, then do not buy this album (Now).  Go buy Brothers and The Big Come Up both of which are better.  El Camino is a very good album.  Is it a little more main stream then their earlier blues rock work?  Yes.  You can debate whether adding back up singers dilutes the Black Keys or augments the Black Keys... but their are quality tunes on the CD.  This work in more commercial and is aimed at a wider audience than their earlier works.  The Black Keys have hit a critical mass.  Brothers went Platinum.  This was destined to happen.  Those that are only happy when they complaining will can call it a sell out.  I do not see it this way.  I see it as some great musicians who worked hard playing small venues for a decade finally getting well paid and well recognized.  They are giving their new broader audience what they want.  This is not their greatest album ever but there is plenty on this CD to please their long term fans.

0374275637|2.0|This book has entertaining anecdotes, but people are buying this to help make better decisions, and it will not do that. Its main thesis is that thinking can be divided into \\"system 1\\" (fast) and \\"system 2\\" (slow). The author argues (while promoting the book) that G.W. Bush is system 1 and B. Obama is system 2. It sounds profound, but it is not. There are a lot of big differences between Bush and Obama, but this is not one of them. This is an overrated book because there is no substance to most of what he says.

0439023513|2.0|Reviews have covered this at great length. I have no problem with a depressing ending & characters dying, but this felt rushed and completely unsatisfying. The series introduced big plots lines and then left you knowing nothing or not following through.<br />Examples of what I'm trying to say (SPOILER ALERT)<br />1. The choice b/w Peeta and Gale that haunts her throughout. In the end, she had no say. Gale up & vanishes with a single sentence comment about his cushy job. Peeta is in b/c he came to her. She chose nothing & there wasn't even a joy b/w P and K that I could even sense.<br />2. The politics. The revolution. What happened?  The whole trilogy was about the need to overthrow this horrifying government and then we aren't given any insight into whether the new one was any better. The new president could be as bad as Coin was. We don't know.  It felt to me as if the new gov't was not a thing to look up to b/c of how Katniss is tried (without her getting to defend herself at all. With no explanation offered to the people of why she did what she did.)  She was the face of the revolution and when she knew the new president was no better, she acted. Then the new gov't didn't bother to understand this or tell anyone. She's just hushed away into exile which implies they very much disapprove of her take on things. Hell, her mom didn't even come to see her.<br /><br />The whole thing, too overwhelmed by her anguish and drugged states and no sense that she accomplished anything in the last third of the book where so many die with her near the capitol, just left me numb. Just like Katniss. Except by the end, I no longer cared. I just wanted it to stop. Nope, that was her too. Felt unbelievable she didn't off herself actually.<br /><br />I didn't need convincing that war sucks. But I would like to believe we're capable of being redeemable.
0061989142|5.0|I purchased this book for my 13 year old sister-in-law. She LOVED it! Great photos and explanations! Any girl can relate to the styles in this book - I want a copy for myself!
0439023521|4.0|Really enjoyed. Reviews have said it all.<br />Did wish the ending wasn't quite so distant (for ex. not seeing Gale for so long)
078513915X|5.0|Hey what a great way to get younger readers to start reading Jane Austen!  Considering it's not the whole text, it is pretty good. You still get the great interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy in spite of it.  By the way am I the only one who thinks that the pose Elizabeth Bennet is in makes it look like she has to go to the bathroom really bad!  Just wondering!  I recommend this graftic novel to others.
0439023491|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and other reviews have covered the whys.<br />I really disliked the ending. It felt hurried and confusing. There were some actions that were out of character and even downright illogical. It was hard to grasp what exactly happened.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|First, I liked this movie, and violated my $10 limit rule for blu-ray (having paid $14 total) to buy it.<br />For the full story line, go to wikipedia.<br />Like most have said, the pace and setup was excellent until Hanna pulls the locator switch, then it drags a bit.<br />Seeing Hanna as an involuntary 16-year old Jason Bourne character who is also coming-at-age was, to say the least, an interesting story line.<br /><br />If you keep several points in mind, you'll find the movie more creditable and enjoyable.  Her DNA was altered to eliminate compassion, pity, etc. and make her stronger with increased mental focus, so 90 lbs of Hanna Heller equals 1 grown up Jason Bourne.<br /><br />She kills in self defence, and I have to admit, while I cheered for her, knocking off CIA operatives who should be chasing down Al-Qaeda terrorists instead, had me conflicted.  But those CIA operatives were scum of the earth while the soldiers were pawns who would kill tribal leaders while hunting insurgents; it is after all, a rogue operation which is why Marissa hires Isaacs (\\"Why do you want me?\\"  Marissa: \\"The CIA won't let me do some things\\", or something like that).<br />Many viewers couldn't accept the \\"reason\\" for the 14-year hunt for Eric & Hanna Heller, but the same story line exists with 3 Jason Bourne movies so just believe that if the CIA wants you dead, they won't forget.  It is a bit weak as Marissa, 14 years ago, seems to be just a field assassin.  Marissa looks hot, and would probably bother a lot of male spymasters.<br /><br />Right after her escape from the CIA compound in the middle of the No. African desert (does Morocco know about it), Hanna comes in contact with everyday life and real people for the first time after leaving the Finland artic cocoon.  The Spanish boy will now learn not to grab girls inappropriately.  It also humanizes her for the audience, and you want her to win and thrive, I did, at least.<br />At the end, everybody dies but Hanna  . . . horray,but what becomes of her ?  bleeding from a bullet in her side, and \\"father\\" and grandmother also dead.  Where does she go, and who is going to mentor her towards emotional maturity.  I wanted a little more sugar, and I'll see if my 11-year old daughter can get some Hanna training before the boys arrive.
140053271X|1.0|I recently purchased the nook thinking it would be great for school.  Most of my readings for class are pdf's that the professors post online.  Reading on the computer screen hurts my eyes and it seems wasteful to print out all the pages.  This seemed like the perfect solution.  However, the result was teeny tiny print on the screen that I was unable to enlarge because it wasn't the Barnes and Noble e-book format.  In addition, the capacity of the device is grossly overestimated.  I have no idea how it is supposed to fit so many books if it couldn't even store 500 pages of pdf document for me.  Definitely something to skip purchasing.  Save your money.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|the app was ok but there were flaws.  I think that you should not have to pay for no ads
0062082353|5.0|This was a great story about a true American Hero \\"Chris Kyle,\\" and the sacrifices he made for his country. It was absolutely gripping, entertaining, and I just couldn't put the book down. This was so detailed it was like being there when in the read, you could almost hear the shot dispersed, it had my pulse pounding, my heart racing. I definitely recommend this book along with one of the greatest military strategy books of today [[ASIN:1934255157 The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Classic Collector's Edition: Includes The Classic Giles and Full Length Translations]]
B0067YF02Q|5.0|What would seem a basic \\"money for revenge\\" premise becomes, in the end, something much deeper.<br />All of the characters bring a great range of depth to their roles in this movie.  This exchange of dialogue between Munny (Eastwood) and the Schofield Kid, takes place after the Kid just killed a man in an outhouse. The Kid: \\"Yeah, well, I guess they had it coming.\\"  Munny \\"we all have it coming Kid\\", is right to the point in this movie.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Really like this app!  Great layout and really easy to use.  Really cant recommend this app enough.  I've tried other readers for the Kindle but this is by far the best.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|One of Jim Carrey's better efforts.  The combination of live action and animations works very well here.<br />Make-up effects are great in this movie.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|it's a good game but I put it on child friendly version and it STILL digested sex on hints. WHAT THE @#$%!
B005PK553C|4.0|Tripped on this series and goot hooked, then aft about 6 episodes it started to get crummy. What happened? Then it disappeared altogether. No more seasons? What happened? Reminds me of another series that was great and faded out. All things must pass I guess. Maybe they made a bunch of money and quit.
B00000G6H1|5.0|This is a classic album from my point of view. I always loved the ONJ sound and this album hits the top as to my opinion. This should be in every collector's discotheque for a good example of the 80's pop music. Listen to it if you didn't until now and enjoy it.
0545265355|5.0|I have this trilogy on my Kindle but I just HAD to have the physical copies. They are written so well and I thoroughly enjoy them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app on my fire and it works great.  punched in my city once and never had to again.<br /><br />the only negative so far that I have noticed is the time on the app does not match the real time on my fire.  it may be the last time it recorded the weather.  I don't know.
B001O54NKS|5.0|Oh!!! I am so glad I got this CD too. Since my record player crapped out, I couldn't listen to my records anymore.  Forgot how much I missed listening to these songs. I was a HUGE Dokken fan in the 80's and still am today. This album is a must buy! Don Dokken is sooo hot!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|WOW, who is this guy and how come i have never read his work before? action, fantasy, and well crafted characters... by the end i was amazed. the longer i read the deeper it pulled me in, like following the lines of a simple well crafted form and discovering ever more intricacy and depth.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I won't repeat the plot line, and simply say I wanted to read it since I always read the book before I go to the movie, because I think it adds context.<br /><br />This is a well written book that should be a great read for anyone old enough to understand it.  Few authors can pull off the age independent writing to this level, and its well worth the time, money, and effort to read it.<br /><br />Why I didn't give it a five is simple.  There are holes in the plot.  How did Rue get caught?  How Katniss deals with the death is critical to the story, but I found the lack of explanation of the death itself cheap.  It should have taken a lot to get to her.  The same with Thresh, who should have been difficult to kill.  The sudden appearance of the genetically altered animals at the end who are based on other characters, and giving Cato a vest to protect him when Katniss shoots everything in the eyes are other examples.  I also am a big fan of the us versus big brother theme, but it wasn't played out very well here, though maybe it is in later books.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, and you will too, but I found myself inventing side stories to finish the loose ends that I think are unlikely to get tied up later.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so convenient at church. I don't have to carry a bible and my church uses the live event feature, so all my verses are at my fingertips, literally.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning series.  Viewing this HD series on a large-screen HD TV makes it feel like you are right there in the middle of the action.  But it isn't just the HD - the quality of the footage they shot that is simply amazing.  Everyone seems to remember the segment where the great white shark catches the seal - Tennyson's \\"nature, red in tooth and claw\\" for sure - but the whole series is just like that one segment.  We live on an astounding planet, and my appreciation of it, and my place in it, has increased tremendously.
0345803485|1.0|I never, ever, ever write reviews for books, but this book was just so boring and unrealistic, I had to write something. Honestly, before I started writing this, I read through some five star reviews just to figure out what readers actually found so great about it. I am baffled by the fact that this was on the New York Times Best Seller List. The \\"love\\" story is completely uninteresting, lacks any depth and has a .00005% chance of actually occurring in real life. And the sex, the sex is even more boring. I am again confused how Ana can withstand Christian's extremely large p**** the very first time she has ever had sex. And not just once, but twice, and still find enjoyment in sex the following night as well. And to be honest, Ana obviously only enjoys the extremely boring sex because she has nothing to compare it to. It is not that this is the best sex of her life, the most erotic relationships she has ever had, the fling that make her see stars...it is that this is the ONLY sex/relationship/fling she has EVER had. My most terrible relationship and terrible sex were better than the characters' sex in this book.<br /><br />To each their own, but if you have the least bit of adventure in your real life, do yourself a favor and please, do not waste your time reading and paying for books like these. If you want eroticism, turn on the porn channel and pay 1.99 for kinkier and more realistic sex and love story lines. Or, I can share stories with you about all of the things I have heard or been witness to in my short, 27 years of life.<br /><br />And lastly, nothing happens in this book. The characters, the situation, the stories are exactly the same in Chapter 3 as they are on the last page of the book. I definitely wasted 24 hours of my life on this book. Hopefully, I've stopped you from doing the same.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has absaloutly nothin wrong with it and it is by far the greatest app ever whoever gets this app loves it so don't be stupid and GET THE APP!!!!!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|What can be learned from a Near Death Experience (NDE)?  Apparently, quite a lot. This book is wonderful reading for anyone, not just for people who might have cancer.  Anita Moorjani tells how she came to be so fearful (which most of us experience) growing up, and how that constant fear and stress is what she believes led to her cancer.  Once she had her NDE, she goes on to tell the reader how it affected her, what she realized while in the \\"other realm\\", how her healing of the cancer came about, and how she lives her life now.  It is my personal feeling that if we all could somehow \\"get\\" what she's telling us, we would end up with a much better, fulfilling and fun life.  I look at my life differently now after having read this very inspiring book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very fun.  It is addicting...can't put it down.  I like that there are so many games to play and unlock.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen both the Swedish and American versions of the book and I have to say the American version is the best, but both versions are good.<br /><br />First off, Rooney Mara's performance is nuanced and the American version seems to give her story more weight. The Swedish version concentrates a little more heavily on other characters. She is after all supposed to be the center of attention. I don't think the Swedish version even quite gave her equal time. Anyway, Naomi does a good job, but she doesn't give you the sense that the character has any mental problems. Rooney totally captures the characters, cold, almost autistic state. You know there is something wrong with her. She deserved the oscar nomination. Infact, all the acting is stellar.<br /><br />Secondly, the way the director devides the story is unique. It's interesting the way the characters come together and it keeps you interested.<br /><br />Lastly, the cinematography of the American version is excellent. Sweden is a beautiful but cold country. It looks pretty on film but I'm glad I don't live there.<br /><br />P.S. This was my favorite film of last year and deserved an oscar nomination.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its a useful app I recommend it to anyone I dont have to pay to download any type of song its so GOOD......:-)
0307957934|2.0|This is the first book I have read by Robert Harris.  I got it because of the synopsis on Amazon.  I think the synopsis was not really indicative of the book.  I found the pace of the story too slow to really get into it.  Some of my friends have a 25-page rule which means that if you haven't hooked the reader in 25 pages the book is not worth reading.  While I agree that most books take more than 50 pages to get interest generated, The Index Fear, didn't catch my interest until almost half way through the entire book.  At that point, the pace picks up and the writing becomes engaging and entertaining.  I think a lot of the 1st half book background could have been written with a faster pace and in the a \\"person\\" view rather than just narrative.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I have a terrible memory and health problems, which used to occasionally result in a missed bill payment. This app makes it easy for me to see what's coming due. Love it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great. Way better than LogMeIn Ignition. Good luck finding a better application for this purpose. So glad they gave this away for free.
B0057EYACI|5.0|I discovered Jim Croce years ago after viewing a 70's movie, \\"Last American Hero\\" about a bootlegger turned racer.  Jim did the theme song \\"I Got a Name\\" which intrigued me.  I bought a greatest hits album- this was all in the 2000s.  I was surprised to find how many of his songs I was already familiar with.  He was a great artist with the complexity to sing on many subjects which all feel very American.  I really enjoy 'The Original Albums', I am certainly a fan and now I have the complete collection.  There are many good songs which I had never heard so I am certainly pleased with this purchase.  If you like Jim Croce, I recommend 'The Original Albums'.
B006C1DH92|1.0|I hats this game I just paid 99 scents and it wont let me even play the game! how will ever get my money back! someone please help me!!!!!!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love to play this game in small chunks.  Easy to pick up and put down on the subway or train.
0786939532|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this series to me and at first I was skeptical. Turns out that<br />I got sucked in and have read almost all of the books. Anyone who enjoys a good fantasy<br />read will love these books. This is the first book in the series and it is a little bit of a slow<br />read at first but once you get into it you will not be able to put it down. I have definitely recommended<br />this book to multiple people and they have all really enjoyed it. Check it out.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, it was a page turner right up to the end.  Loved how it tied Sarah's story from 1942 with Julia's in the present day.  It is a reminder of how important it is to remember our history.
031618201X|5.0|Being an enthusiast for this series in book form as well as an enthusiastic reader of manga, I was excited to see this item, but a little unsure as to the quality.  After purchasing and reading it, however, I found to my delight that my uncertainty was unfounded - it is simply marvelous!  The art style is well suited to the story and the characters are well designed and detailed.  The dialogue, though having to fit within word balloons, still retains the flavor and at times the exact wording that makes the books so clever and enjoyable.  The illustrations of Conall and Alexia together are certainly apt to set the blood racing.  Recommended wholeheartedly for fans of the books, and I only hope there will be more of the manga version to enjoy in future!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a nice watch.  Its tough the crystal doesn't scratch and its water resistant.  I've worn it swimming in the ocean.  Its also easy to set the time/date.  The band is very adjustable.  My 10 year old liked mine and it fit him so I bought a second one.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I rented this movie for a solo night. Bad idea! I paused it a few times, made some snacks and tried all sort of diverting stuff to move my mind away from this movie. It is that scary. It's not the typical story of poltergeist, or possession or any other spooky theme so worn out by Hollywood movies, it's a completely new idea they describe as the Further. The limbo world where evil dwells.<br />By the way, the bluray cover for this movie depicting a child and a house on the background is misleading. I thought it would be something like \\"The Orphan\\" or \\"The Omen\\" where there is an evil kid who does a lot of evil things. Here is not that way at all.<br />Try to watch this movie alone and I bet you will turn it off before half an hour. Better yet, get someone to watch it with you and enjoy what I consider the best scary movie ever made.
B000000WJ4|5.0|My background: fan since 69 listening to Progressive Blues in Nam, favorite solo, Jumpin Jack Flash, favorite albums, Second Winter and Still Alive and Well.  I definitely have always been closer to the old stuff.<br /><br />I bought Let Me In when it came out.  It had some good stuff but I thought many of the tempos were too rushed which detracted a lot for me.  So I didn't get this one when it came out.  Bought it a few years ago on cd and it has mostly set on my shelf since.  Got it out the other day for some loud music in the car and WOW!  Ignore the Christmas song.  There is one good Reso song, like he would do on his earlier albums.  Outside of that it is one blistering solo after another.  The uptempos leave enough room to breath and I have to admit that I think his solos here are better than most of his older stuff.  Even on the uptempos there will be a fast flurry of notes at a release point in the solo that I don't think I've ever heard anyone else do.  Usually even good players tend to stay around the beat on the uptempo stuff and save their flurries for the slow blues.  Here Johnny shows what a technical master he is.  The songs are pretty decent, the arrangements aren't overcrowded or rushed.<br /><br />I will always love Johnny but after hearing I'm A Bluesman I don't think we'll ever be passing this way again.  If I had to recommend one later period Winter to one of those old fans like me it would be this one.  Go, Johnny, Go!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was given Settlers as a birthday gift.  It was a few months before we actually attempted to play it, and at first the rules were very confusing.<br /><br />But after a few trial runs of the game and figuring out just how the mechanics worked, this game has become a staple in our house.  Almost every weekend we'll roll this game out and play at least one, if not more games.<br /><br />It's certainly refreshing and different, coming from my only other experiences of games being Sorry, Connect 4, Monopoly, Checkers, and the like. I really do enjoy the mechanics and flow of the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Our book club chose The Hunger Games for our March book. It is not a book that I would have chosen on my own. I was surprised that I enjoyed it. It draws you in and before you know it you are hooked. I have just finished the second book in the series and can't wait to get started on the third.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game but what is ner?  there is a sign on every level and at 3-3 coins spell NER. that's all I want to know
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having this app on both my Kindle Fire and phone!  Easy to use, easy to access, couldn't ask for anything more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just imagine being so beaten down that noone dares defy the government when they set children to killing each other for sport?  Imagine the strength it takes to be the one who stands up, not by choice but for your own survival?  This book was so amazing I could not put it down.  I am sooooo glad I have kindle because I downloaded all 3 books and read them in 3 days!
B004J4WLB4|1.0|I tried so hard to like this book, I really did but I got SO bored by the flowers,by Vicoria's attitude, Grant and Elisabeth! Actually so happy I finished this book and sorry Vanessa never again, as a mother and as reader!
B0052U59F4|2.0|This is a thinly disguised adult version of twilight, using BDSM instead of vampires. Twilight is better. You can see where this is going - she is going to 'cure' him of his need for dominance. He needs to find someone new.
B001AW156U|5.0|Hello guys and gals if you are still tired of your ps3 controller triggers then heads up and read this. I love my Xbox triggers so I went ahead and bought a Xbox compatible look-a-like controller with curved outward triggers for the Ps3. Now for just pennies you can buy this item and simply just slip them on your Ps3 triggers and presto almost like magic you'll have a better trigger finger. They go on firm and sturdy so far they have not slipped off. If you want use crazy glue and they'll stay on. They feel very comfortable and I like them alot. Try them yourself for the price it won't hurt.
1933952806|5.0|I would recommend this book....it is easy to understand unlike some owner's manuals.  Lots of actual pictures of the view finder and playback screen.  Great reference book!!!
B0031RS588|5.0|Decided to read the book after a recent viewing of the classic 1996 film. It is fantastically, gritty and true to life at the time I'm sure. Would definitely recommend, along with the sequel Porno.<br />Looking forward to the release of Skag Boys in 2012!
0439023513|5.0|I'm a happy ending kid of gal.  I want good to triumph over evil, I want love to conquer all, and I want hope to shine through despair.  I saw the passionately mixed reviews prior to reading this book, and I figured the only way I was going to get through it was to strip away any expectations I had.  From the terrible reviews, I was prepared for the worst.  From the good reviews, I had hope for the best.<br /><br />Bottom line... it's more subtle than I'm used to, and I feel like I had to crawl through fire ants to get there, but I got the happy ending. Good did triumph over evil, love did conquer all, and hope did shine through despair.  There's a taint to it, from all they've been through, but it makes it even more meaningful.  It's also clear to me that the sacrifices have not been in vain.  Panem is changed, and the realities of life that Katniss, Peeta, and Gale had to live through, first hand, the new generation only has to read about in schoolbooks.<br /><br />It helped me, when reading this book, to keep in mind that Katniss is just 17.  She's not a warrior.  She's not an activist.  She's not a politician.  She's doesn't relate well to others.  She's just a 17 year old girl... with strong self preservation instincts.<br /><br />Only one thing surprised me... I thought for sure, after reading the reviews, that the series had gone too far and was no longer suitable for young adults.  I'm glad to say that's not the case.  I would recommend it to all readers from 12 to 112.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|This was great.  I'm going to be honest, I haven't watched it yet, so I don't actually know what the quality of the disc itself is, but it got to me really quickly and it was sold at a decent price.  Thanks!
B005Z9MH98|1.0|Love this movie, but I am totally unsatisfied with the quality of the blu ray version...beware  the blu ray version is no better than the cheaper DVD version and the movie completely stopped 5 minutes before the ending.  I guess blu ray no longer means 1080p.
B006TXDOZ0|4.0|2nd album from British band who specialize in garagey indie rock with some raw, distortion-<br />  damaged, bluesy guitar riffs--complimented by gentle folk/Americana vocal harmonies over<br />  subtle, tension-building rock chords that explode into action.  Recalls bands like the Kills, White<br />  Stripes, Black Keys, Heartless Bastards, Royal Trux.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've had this app for a bit under a month now, and I have to say it's kind of awesome. Game play is uber-smooth and I can change the settings to pretty much anything I want. I know some people have down rated this app because of the full page ads that appear prior to gameplay, but if they'd. just take the time to look they'd see how easy it is to just skip out of them immediately. An overall great app and boredom killer.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|This is a really good, mellow cd. More than just one good song. It's a good listen start to finish. Have to like any guy named Wally putting out some music.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this app.  I play it daily and it is the first thing I load onto any new phone I get.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|fun game, good time waster, everyone who says you have to pay to play is an idiot. ive not paid a single dollar.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Although this book was fiction, it was very real.  Alzheimer's is a devastating illness, we tend to think it only affects the elderly. This book brings to light the realization that some people are affected by early onset.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|a great game to pass time but there are sticky or poor controls it was frustrating when I was almost done until the update all progress was lost there are ads popping up even when I'm playing a minigame
1401937519|2.0|I was a little disappointed in some of the aspects of this book. It was well written, but was  too \\"new agey\\" for me. She never really clarified what her spiritual beliefs were & I was confused by some of her descriptions of her experience. A person gets the idea that there are never any consequences for your actions as she states even the worst murderers &terrorists are all one.So, by that reasoning, no matter how much misery you cause others in your life, you go to the same place as the most generous, loving &kind people. It's not that I want anyone to burn, but I do believe there should be some form of punishment.  Oh well, off my soapbox.....just not my cup of tea.
B0058VW36U|5.0|its a fun game and has great controls or somethingy u should try it and people who rate it 1 star why? and the little om non is really cute
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can finaully get up from my desk and still know what's going on with work.I wish I had my third monitor but two will do. Thank you.
0345803485|2.0|As I read this I couldn't help but wonder what a good editor might have done for this book (aside from slash all the repetetive, overused phrases such as \\"jeez\\", and \\"gasped\\".)  Unfortunately, the auther published this as an e-book which was later picked up by a small publishing house.<br /><br />The premise is interesting, but the writing is so poor it's hard to stay with it.  If I have to read one more time about Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and the way Christian's pants \\"hung from his hips in that way\\" I might just chuck this book out the window.  I don't understand how any author can use and reuse phrases as often as this one does, and not see how it hurts the story.  I mean, how boring can you get?  And what might have been great scenes of erotic imagery become repetetive, rote, poorly described dribble to be skimmed over.  Every utterance by either character, every move is repeated ad nauseum such as how Ana bends her neck, how Christian kisses her back, etc.  It's just boring and overdone, and it amazes me that not only did this book get picked up by any publishing house, but that it will be made into a film.  I'm bewildered!
B000053VJI|4.0|Great CD, however the reason I ordered it from amazon.com was because of track 3, \\"Woman del Callo\\", as listed in this web page, right?. Wrong, track 3 is actually \\"Si tú te vas\\"....<br />So to follow amazon.com instructions on writing good reviews: \\"What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?\\" I would have wanted to know the right track listing.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|it'svery nice that this ia available on the phone. but i cannot get page view (non-text) to work for magazines and the suggested books at the bottom makes it a little annoying and busy.
B004132HZS|5.0|Marvellous British television series. Update of Sherlock Holmes's stories. Excellent writing, pretty cleaver in the details. One of the best television series I've seen during the last decade. No need to write much more. My five star (and most others as well) tell the whole story.<br /><br />Series one is available at less than half price on amazon's uk site. In fact you get both series one and two at a lower price than the current item!<br /><br />My advice is to get both series one and series two because they are kind of connected.

No disrespect to the strong work of Epica, Edenbridge, Amberian Dawn, etc. in recent years (I consider all these bands to have some great songs but overall inconsistent albums), but this is possibly the best studio album in female-fronted symphonic metal since 2004, when [[ASIN:B0011ZWKDS Nightwish's \\"Once\\"]] and [[ASIN:B001D57C0C Within Temptation's \\"The Silent Force\\"]] were released.  This is no small praise.  Xandria's \\"Neverworld's End\\" is amazing.  Get it!

0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck depicts three generations of human beings for whom life is the most cruel teacher or torturer you can imagine. More cruelty cannot exist in life, in any human being's life, except within deportation to a slow torturing extermination camp. John Steinbeck is the American Emile Zola.<br /><br />And yet he finds his inspiration in Genesis, Chapter 4, verses 1-16, the story of Abel and Cain, of Abel slain by Cain and Cain punished by God with a phenomenal promotion since his descendants will be the inventors of cities, music, metallurgy and a few other essential human inventions. Many people would like to be cursed to do that. Steinbeck stops though before that future and terminates the story on the curse from God and the mark Cain will carry to protect him against an accidental and fast end, hence to enjoy his curse as long as possible. That's the God of Genesis. But a lot more about it in the novel and this review.<br /><br />The whole novel centers on the reading in King James Bible of the passage in Genesis quoted above and then a discussion about the translation and meaning of verse 7. The exploration of the meaning of that verse is conducted by the Chinese servant of the central character Adam (in the Bible the father of Abel and Cain), the perfectly named man since we are dealing with the descent of the first human beings in the Garden of Eden and then out of it. This verse 7 has two translations. In King James version Jehovah says:<br /><br />\\"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\\"<br /><br />The meaning is a promise from God to Cain, a prediction that comes from some higher authority, in a way a contract with God, with this higher authority. But in the American Standard Bible, the end of the answer is:<br /><br /> \\"Do thou rule over it.\\"<br /><br />And that is an order from God to Cain (an interrogative form would have used \\"doest\\").<br /><br />Our Chinese servant, Lee, with the help of four learned Chinese in San Francisco and two rabbis, cuts the Gordian knot of these two translations and readings that are both wrong. They go back to Hebrew and the word concerned here is « Timshel » and this word means \\"thou mayest rule over him.\\" Lee identifies this as the possibility of a choice on Cain's side: the choice to rule over sin or be ruled over by sin. It is an eventuality expressed my \\"mayest\\" that leaves the choice open, unpredicted and unordered, and it could even be seen as a permission from God that gives Cain the initiative and responsibility to do or not to do. Neither a prediction for sure nor an order definitely.<br /><br />I am of course not going to tell the story but it is easy to show how Steinbeck invests this biblical reference in the novel from beginning to end. The reference to the Garden of Eden in Chapter 15-3 and the Eves who like apples. Four mentions of Genesis Chapter 4 in Chapter 24-2, in Chapter 47-2, in Chapter 54-1, in Chapter 55-3, one sentence and six words before the final period.<br /><br />Numerous other mentions of Cain's crime and punishment  are scattered in the book but what is more visible is the use of the couple of initials C and A.<br /><br />First generation. A certain Cyrus Trask with an unnamed Mrs Trask who is Absent as soon as the second page procreates Adam. Later with his second wife Alice he provides Adam with a brother Charles. That's the second generation and the love and hostility between the two brothers are exposed in much detail. It will not lead to the death of Charles, but Adam will move west to California abandoning his brother to whom he will only write some fifteen years later to find out that he is dead. Charles' death, and his being killed by Adam is purely elliptical, purely symbolical.<br /><br />Charles will have no descendants.<br /><br />Adam runs away from Charles in Connecticut to California, the Salinas valley with awounded woman they both recuperated on their door step. She is called Cathy and from what we know she killed her parents and was severely beaten up by what amounts to her pimp when she rebelled against him. Adam falls in absolute blind love with her and Charles wants her away as soon as possible. Adam will take her to California against her will but after she has had one sexual night with Charles. She will be discovered pregnant in California but with twin boys, false twins, the two being very different.<br /><br />As soon as the boys are delivered and Cathy is strong enough to walk, she leaves Adam and the boys in the sole hands of Adam's servant Lee. She shoots Adam before leaving to prevent him from preventing her from going away. That episode will ruin Adam's life and energy and he will end up living on the inheritance he got from his own father and had shared with his brother.<br /><br />The two boys will be named, from the Bible, under the strong initiative of a neighbour who is under the strong order from his Bible-bound wife. The boys will be named without surprise Caleb for the dark one and Aaron fro the blond one, later shortened to Cal and Aron, both from the Bible. Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his spokesman, later the high priest of the Jews when leaving Egypt, is also the one who brought the golden calf into existence. He will not go into the Promised Land just like Moses himself. Caleb takes part in the Exodus and will be one of the twelve scouts who see the Promised Land and he will, along with Joshua, advocate immediate taking possession of it. Moses and Aaron will stay behind and never get to it. These facts are not mentioned or alluded to in the novel. That C - A couple is loaded with a lot of meaning.<br /><br />Cathy becomes Kate and a Madame in Salinas. She will finally die remembering her favorite literary character that helped her escape her parents, and eventually kill them, i.e. Alice in Wonderland. Another C - A  ouple, even if virtual.<br /><br />Adam will not remarry but will live with his Chinese Servant who will take care of the children. This Lee is essential in the whole novel. At the end of the novel, the nurse who will take care of Adam for a very short period of time will call him a chink and Charley, creating thus an A - C couple. Adam is thus taken between two Cs: Cathy/Kate - Adam - Chink/Charley. Of course the nickname Charley is an allusion to Charles, Adam's brother and probably a mental embodiment of this brother of his that he had abandoned to his own slow and lonely fate and death.<br /><br />The love and hostility between Caleb and Aron will naturally be the main course of the novel. They are Abel and Cain, Aron having the project of raising hares, hence be a herdsman like Abel, and Caleb of cultivating his father's farm, hence be a farmer like Cain. This is stated in Chapter 22-4, just after the first reading of Genesis Chapter 14:1-16 in King James Bible. It is the strong \\"thou shalt rule\\" prediction of verse 7 of this story that will determine Lee's research because he disagrees with that fatality: for him a human being is human because he always keeps the capability to choose, to operate his free choosing power.<br /><br />This third generation will relive the drama of their father with the girl who will intrude into the story. She is called Abra (her father wanted a boy and would have called him Abraham, both like Lincoln and like the patriarch in the Bible who is ready to sacrifice his own son Isaac - or Ishmael - on the simple command from God.) Abra will fall in love with the beautiful blond Aron, but it will eventually not work because Aron is pure and dreams her as pure, and after Aron's death she will move to Caleb who is bad just the way she is bad. And that will be another C and A couple. We have to be very careful with the use fo bad or pure in this novel. Both words are mythical and if they are mystical in a way it is essentially because they are full of mist.<br/><br />Aron will die in France in 1918 after enlisting for the war because he is led to his mother Cathy/Kate who he did not know before by Caleb - out of spite because Aron had been preferred by Adam and Caleb had been severely and unfairly if not unjustly rejected - and Aron thus discovers she is a Madame in a house of ill fame next door to his own family home. Another C - A - C triad surges and turns very bad in this case, Caleb - Aron - Cathy/Kate. Then Aron cannot accept this for him abominable fact that proves he is rotten at the core in spite of his absolute dream of being virginally pure.<br /><br />I will of course not give the many details but the biblical fable is led to the worse possible ending. Caleb's initiative, caused by Adam's rejection of Caleb, leads to the death of Aron and this death leads to a bad end for Adam. Caleb in other words kills two birds with one stone, though we could consider Adam killed the two birds with one stone. It is in fact this second interpretation that the intervention of Lee in a new triad Chink/Charley - Adam - Caleb will bring, the only moment of relief of the book with the final word \\"Timshel\\" that opens the door to the couple Caleb - Abra and a next generation. Knowing the cursing nature of God, and John Steinbeck, I would be surprised if that fourth generation were not plagued with more curses. Isn't the punishment of god to be carried out till the seventh generation?<br /><br />This fateful, cursed and remorseless story is told to us with an avalanche of details that we just cannot stop reading - even though the story telling itself is slow - and we are torn open with compassion, empathy, remorse, sorrow and an ocean of love and hate for Caleb who is thus turned into a plaything in the hands of God. In fact this can expand to all the male characters and a little to the female characters who are few: Cathy/Kate who is the born and everlasting ever-regenerating doomster and doom-generator in human life; and Abra who is a promise who defines herself as bad, and that is a promise indeed.<br /><br />The last Cain-like son and brother, if he is really saved, is saved by the alliance of the Chink/Chinese/Charley Lee with Abra, a son who was a girl and who will be a wife since she cannot be a brother and that might break the mould of the curse. The final word will come from Adam and it will be \\"timshel\\" but will that mean freedom or just the introduction  to the next Caleb - Abra cursed couple in line with producing the next generation of Cain and Abel, of doomed brothers? That we cannot know and I won't tell what I may think. I shall not tell and don't tell me to tell because I may do what I freely want to do, tell or not tell included.<br /><br />What is left to say after this long dissertation? Not much at all. John Steinbeck's style is his own and some sentences are hard to get because they contain quite a few dangling modifiers.<br /><br />This book is also the enlightenment that gives the meaning of later books like Of Mice and Men, the story of two disproportionate \\"brothers\\", the big one called Lennie Small being in the end killed by the little one called George Milton, a visionary name and person who was able to imagine and describe the promised land of a farm on which Lennie would have been happy and protected.<br /><br />And we are not surprised the dog Steinbeck will travel with at the end of his life was called Charley. The subservient loving friend that Lee was all along in this novel whose title is taken from Genesis, Chapter 4. And when Caleb is asked by his father at the end where his brother Aron is he naturally answers \\"Am I supposed to look after him?\\" an echo to Cain's answer to God's question in King James Bible or the American Standard Version : \\"I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?\\"<br /><br />This answer turns Adam into God himself since he is the one who asked the question: \\"Do you know where your brother is?\\"<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU.<br /><br />Adam will not remarry but will live with his Chinese Servant who will take care of the children.

Stephen Sommers, that's how! I have NO idea why they still pay this guy to make movies! After this garbage they still let him direct G.I.Joe!!! I was SO excited to see this when it came out at theaters, but was SO let down when I did. The stunts in this movie are beyond ridiculous, and there are so many coincidences that the story just becomes laughable. I just watched this on television the other day, and felt the need to vent. If someone in Hollywoodland is paying attention, PLEASE DO NOT let that Stephen Sommers douche make anymore movies!

B005P1YCNK|5.0|Title and Author:  The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy<br /><br />Synopsis of Content:<br />Darren Hardy, successful businessman, public speaker and editor of Success Magazine provides in The Compound Effect a careful study of those things we must do and those we must avoid to be successful. He teaches how small efforts, repeated over time, create compound effects - that is - they build into a much larger accomplishment than one might realize as one does the small things each day.<br /><br />Likewise the compound effect also works to defeat us if we fail to do the right things each day or do the wrong things each day. That one candy bar once a week for example, adds pounds to us over the course of a year. That one apple each day can help foster greater health over time.<br /><br />Hardy begins by describing how the compound effect works both to our benefit and our detriment and demonstrates how crucial it is to be aware of what we are doing and take control of the things that matter. It is about forming and sustaining good habits and defeating bad ones.<br /><br />He then explains how the choices we make each day influence and drives our outcomes. He describes how positive habits build us up and create long term achievement while bad habits do the opposite.<br /><br />Next he discusses momentum - how small steps taking deliberately and consistently over time build momentum which then makes it all easier and more effective over time. He explains the power of rhythm and consistency in what we do.<br /><br />Finally he discusses the power of influence upon us, both good and bad, from the people with whom we associate, the things we choose to do, the way we spend our time, etc.<br /><br />The book also includes various resources that you can obtain access to on-line which can deepen your experience and put the lessons learned into practice.<br /><br />Some have criticized The Compound Effect as just another version of the same old ideas found in a thousand success or self-help books. In a sense this is true and Hardy, who is an unapologetic fan of Jim Rohn, cites Rohn's observation that the principles of success are never new - they are time tested and ancient. We fail to benefit from them to the extent we fail to understand them or more often to the extent we fail to heed them.<br /><br />What Hardy does in this book is repackage these ancient ideas in a more modern discussion and format using helpful illustrations and his own unique perspective about how they have worked for him and many others. There is always value in this. The more we can see how others have learned from these principles and applied them the more we will understand how we can do the same.<br /><br />Hardy was raised in a very disciplined manner by a rather harsh father who was a no nonsense sports coach. With this background he naturally is comfortable with the kinds of self-discipline he urges upon the reader to achieve at a higher level. For those who are lazy or just dislike the rigor of self-discipline this book may not offer much. For anyone who is willing to do the work this book is an excellent introduction into what works.<br /><br />Usefulness:<br />Anyone who is serious about improving their lives and their outcomes can benefit from this book. It is an easy read and contains a lot of practical lessons on how to implement these ideas.<br /><br />Readability/Writing Quality:<br />The book is well written and easy to read. It is well organized and contains enough repetition to be instructive but not so much as to be redundant.<br /><br />Notes on Author:<br />Darren Hardy was a self-made millionaire at a young age and successful in business for many years before moving into the success industry. He is an author, speaker, mentor and editor of Success magazine.<br /><br />Related Website:<br />You can learn more about Hardy at [...] .

B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are a variety of short games to pass the time. However there are MANY ads. I would not let my kids play with this since there are many requests to download free apps. I don't know the permissions or purposes of these games so I don't trust them.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it the only thing is that you loose power but it's one of the best games I have ever plaid.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great go to game.  Everyone in my family enjoys it and I especially like the random draw feature.  Simply one of the best games.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I have to be honest in saying that these are not literary masterpieces by any stretch. To say they were a \\"light read\\" is an understatement. I do not consider myself Well read or a fast reader, but I wrapped all three books up in less than a week. The story line from the first two books kept my interest enough and I was able to visualize the story quite easily through Suzanne Collins' writing style. The continuation in the final story contained a number of unnecessary side stories, red headed Avox for one, that drew no real conclusions to Katniss' character development. It was a hodge podge of ideas, thoughts and emotions that were scattered and left me annoyed with the heroine. Maybe the story outline was nonexistent or there was a rush to print. The idea of being used again by someone else, President Coin, to achieve power was seen early on and the idea that Katniss' \\"friends\\" continued this alliance with a second warring district with no clue doesn't seem possible knowing that they were all there with such valued and sound advice earlier.<br />I can understand the emotional conflict Katniss had over the love of Peeta or Gale. This is a young woman with no real ability to love unconditionally or be able to understand her deep emotions for another let alone have to choose between two. Yet there was no real evolution to this aspect just a simple and quick Epilogue twenty years in the future. It would have been more reasonable for her to have run off chapters earlier with either Gale or Peeta to kill Snow on a personal mission and start her adult life, free, in the open world. The story began with the idea that here is this strong, independent young woman thrown into a grown up world to discover her true self and carve a life for herself, free and empowered. Instead we get beat up, broken and sad.<br />I believe I have given more thought to this simple review that the author gave to this conclusion........
B0063IH60K|1.0|Loved this game until they recently added video commercials between each play&hellip;and it's the same Starbucks commercial every time. So annoying I ended up deleting the game.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|This movie never got going. It is a shame to waste the time viewing this film. My wife and I both sat through it wondering when it would get exciting but it never did. The actors were good but the script was dull.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|I made the mistake of seeing this shortly after viewing the original 1979 masterpiece. The whole essence of the original is lost, with nothing satisfactory created in it's place. Plot points are crudely spelled out, characters are flattened, suspense is replaced with revulsion from horrific gore, and the essential Englishness of the whole thing is completely absent except for the accents. It would have been better to have changed the context and freed themselves up than try to go head to head with the original interpretation on it's own terms.  The result is a real mess.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its alright..but most of the games yoou have to buy with the coins yoou earn..but they cost a lot and most of the games are hard...but fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. i have it on my cell, ipod touch and now my kindle. so much fun. it does freeze a lil bit  tho
0765324857|5.0|From the screenwriter of \\"The Crow,\\" \\"Bioshock: Rapture\\" offers an in-depth look into the lives, economics, politics, and world of Rapture. Playing the games is fun; however, actually knowing the grit that goes along brings deeper meaning to game play. It doesn't matter if you're a hardcore Bioshock fan or an avid reader, this is a great book for everybody.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Fast and quick delivery. We also saw the movie so I can enjoy the book the more. I hope to enjoy this for years to come. Thanks for the great service.
0307887898|5.0|This is a great book in the sense that the author is a serious student of his subject and accordingly has created a viable synthesis. It is also great because it led me to \\"Crossing The Chasm.\\" by Moore and \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" by Christensen.<br /><br />The last three steps in the author's method, Validated Learning, Build - Measure - Learn, and Innovation Accounting, seem compelling and the steps to put them into action are clear.<br /><br />To me everything else in the book was encapsulated inside of getting an MVP out there and commencing the iteration process.<br /><br />Reading this book and then Moore's \\"Crossing The Chasm\\" immediately after has greatly deepened my marketing insights.<br /><br />I also think that having basic business management and marketing theory prior to reading these books will increase the value of these books.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the final exciting instalment of the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. Katniss Everdeen, having survived her first Hunger Games and been plucked out of the Quarter Quell by the rebels living in District t13, is now required to become the symbol of the rebellion, the Mockingjay. But while her mother and her sister Prim were rescued by her best friend, Gale, her own District 12 has been destroyed and Peeta Melark is a captive of the Capitol. It takes a reminder of President Coriolanus Snow to cement her resolve to become the Mockingjay. But while the revolution gains strength, Katniss is torn by the number of people dying for the cause she is heading: she is beginning to wonder if the regimentation of District 13 and President Alma Coin are any better than the Capitol and Snow. In this thrilling finale, Collins uses her main character to comment on: the power of the media and those who control it; how circumstances can turn gentle people into warriors; how power corrupts; the futility of war; and how those who develop weapons have no control over how they will be used. Collins gives the reader believable characters and an electrifying plot with plenty of twists. This may not be capital L literature, but it is nonetheless a gripping and thought-provoking read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This would definetly make my favorite games!! I play it 24/7! Best game ever!!!! I extremely recamend it!!!! You must buy it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like this game. Its entertaining like all of the other Angry Birds. I couldn't stop playing it. I played it for hours. Love it.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I couldn't set it up without using my email. I also cant draw using programs like paint on my kindle. the only thing that can be done it viewing things, and editing documents. could be better. slow, lagging.
B005TZFZ9W|1.0|I don't know what bother me more... the fact that his music sucks so bad or the fact that this music can even be considered good by anyone. Tyga and Soulja boy are about the same.. both just make up words and take one line and repeat it many times. Rack city chick, what a joke.
0439023521|4.0|I was gripped from the very first page. I think, for me, the most striking part of the book was Katniss. I absolutely fell in love with her. I loved that Katniss was strong, yet flawed and complex, but relatable. I liked that at times, yes, she was manipulative and she was calculating. I think it made her a more well-rounded character. Are there flaws in the writing? Sure, but the execution, pacing, and character building more than made up for it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app! It's easy to use and very detailed.  Works everytime too, doesn't freeze up like some apps do.
0439023513|3.0|I'm still a little bit conflicted about Mockingjay. On one hand, I love the direction Suzanne took - that in the end, it was never about the games. It was about a revolution, the human condition, and an unwavering collective hope that after war will come peace and a better life for all. On the other hand, I found myself liking Katniss less and less. She was a vastly different person from Book 1 to this installment, and I'm not quite sure that change was for the positive. Overall, however, I thought that Mockingjay was a great, unforgettable ending to an already unforgettable series.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a dystopian novel writ­ten for young adults (YA). Even though the main audi­ence tar­geted, the book has struck chords with par­ents as well and has been a best seller since it came out.<br /><br />North Amer­ica has been destroyed and is now run by the pow­er­ful Cap­i­tal and is dev­ided into 12 dis­tricts (dis­trict 13 has been destroyed due to a rebel­lion). In dis­trict 12 ace hunter Kat­niss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl, carves out a mea­ger exis­tences for her­self, her younger sis­ter Prim and their wid­owed mother. In order to keep the 12 dis­tricts aware of who runs the county, the Cap­i­tal arranges a game to the death each year in an elab­o­rate arena. Each dis­tricts holds a draw­ing of one boy and one girl to go as trib­utes. When her sis­ter is picked, Kat­niss exer­cises her option to vol­un­teer for the games. Along with Kat­niss comes also Peeta, the baker's son, who grew up with her.<br /><br />Kat­niss and Peeta must fend for them­selves against nat­ural ele­ments, the Gamemak­ers and the other con­tes­tants whose only option is to kill or be killed.<br /><br />I'll admit it, I read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins because my wife did and I didn't... we can't have that now.<br />Can we?<br /><br />I can cer­tainly see why the book was such a hit. The novel struck many chords and many themes (teenage anguish, love, work, poverty and more), was an easy and quick read, as well as full of action.<br /><br />Ms. Collins built a fan­tas­ti­cal and believ­able world where the United States is no more and instead the coun­try is now called Panem which is run from \\"The Cap­i­tal\\" and divided into 12 dis­tricts. The story pro­gresses quickly and flu­ently with well defined char­ac­ters who have lame names.<br />Don't tell me that the baker's son is named Peeta (Pita) by accident.<br /><br />I can cer­tainly under­stand how the YA crowd fell head over heels for this novel.<br /><br />For me though, and I under­stand per­fectly well I'm not the tar­get audi­ence, the love tri­an­gle was clich&eacute; but I loved the vio­lence and speed of this novel. The con­stant sus­pense kept me turn­ing page after page as, I assume, most of those who read the book. Once I got over my name prej­u­dice, I even liked the pro­tag­o­nist - a bow and arrow female Wil­helm Tell, how can you not like her?<br /><br />Ms. Collins' prose is effi­cient in a no-nonsense style filled with dry humor which causes the book to become addic­tive. Like any good story, you are immersed in the uni­verse built around you, yet you know it is not real but you can't stop reading.<br /><br />That being said, there were some aspects of the book which were too con­ve­nient, when Kat­niss babysits Peeta the sec­ond half of the book, the stuff she needs floats down from the sky, that might be pass­able for the intended audi­ence, but not for me. Also the end­ing was a bit dis­ap­point­ing, I espe­cially dis­liked the mutated were­wolves but, since this is part of an extremely suc­cess­ful tril­ogy and the audi­ence cer­tainly stuck around to find out what hap­pens - who am I to say anything?this novel.<br /><br />For me though, and I under­stand per­fectly well I'm not the tar­get audi­ence, the love tri­an­gle was cliché but I loved the vio­lence and speed of this novel.

0439023491|5.0|There seems to be a general feeling of disappointment about this book, and I'm going to have to disagree. It is a bit slower than it's predecessor, but I think that's what made this book awesome. The slow build of the narrative paralleled perfectly with the rising unrest and rebellion within the different districts. It's not perfect, and I do wish that Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were developed a little bit more (in a lot of ways, I find that Katniss went through growth regression), but I still thought this sequel was enjoyable as a whole.
B007G5K066|1.0|Some blu-ray disks will resume after power off, others don't.  Some disks permit previews to be bypassed, others don't.  This disk does neither.  So, if you want to resume next day, not only has your place been forgotten, but you have to endure all the previews before you can even begin to hunt for your place.  Any disk with these failings will get a one star rating from me.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this again.  I was around when they first smurfed onto the scene, and am thrilled now to share with the grandkids. Blue visions all around. Boo! Gargamel!
B007Q476KU|5.0|Rather than analyze this and thoroughly pick it apart piece by piece, I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed it and leave it at that.<br /><br />But I think the hours the horses had to stand around having these peculiar pink creatures fuss over them and get them to do things they didn't understand merits at least a mention in the credits of the name of the warhorse and his raven haired sidekick. After all, without them, there wouldn't have been a movie.

0439023521|5.0|I got the books from my school library, and I LOVE IT! Katniss is so awesome, Peeta is so nice, and Rue is the sweetest thing EVER! I cried when she died. :( So sad. But overall, BEST BOOK EVER!!
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I purchased the \\"complete\\" game, but when you click on one of the numbered boxes, nothing happens! I should have heeded the other reviews!
0316098329|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't put it down!<br /><br />I thought Emma did a fantastic job writing this story, I imagine it could be quite hard to tune into a 5-year-old's mind but this she did and I believe she did so with much authenticity.<br /><br />So much one could say about this book, you could discuss the psychological aspects for hours, but I must say you have to give kudos to the mum, I thought she was a hero.<br /><br />Read it, you must!
0345803485|2.0|I thought this book was boring and redundant.  I skipped parts of it that I just couldn't bear to read.  It could have been half as long as it is.  It is a fantasy story about a drop dead gorgeous rich guy and a female college graduate with no sexual experience at all who is a virgin.  Don't waste your money! I read it out of curiosity.  Waste of time.
0060853972|3.0|If we had half stars I'd definitely give this one three and a half, it's more 7 out of 10 for me. I loved the basis for the book. I wish we could have spent more time with Aziraphale and Crowley, they were definitely my favourite characters, with Crowley just coming out on top. Some parts were really funny and the footnotes were very entertaining. Great, quick read.
B000RLKXEK|5.0|I love love love this movie.  It has comedy, romance, sex, and mystery.  You cannot go wrong with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan.
0743277708|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this one and must say the author is brilliant because I could see exactly what he was describing and because this book is about rabbits and I haven't the faintest (or didn't before I read this book) idea of what goes on in their world then to me it showed this guy knows how to write.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can do justice to the book with this review so won't press on other than to say that I loved the characters, became very attached to them, enjoyed their adventures and would definitely recommend this book
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Like a once brand new shiny Cadillac that was Whitney Houston, listening to \\"I Look To You\\", it's hard to ignore the cracks in her voice.  Throughout the disc, even for the casual fan, it's hard to look past the strain in Whitney's voice as she tries to make  ill-fated attempts to hit a high note.  In most cases, that attempt comes back to slap her in the face.  I am being very objective here.  As critical as I have been of Mariah Carey's voice and its deterioration over the years, it still sounds miles ahead of what Houston has to offer here.<br /><br />The disc gets off to a rousing start in the Alicia Keys-penned \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" and we get a rejuvenated Whitney at the wheels.  But quickly the wheels come off as this disc progresses to an increasingly uncertain course.  Yes, Whitney Houston was once the brightest and shiniest Cadillac in the galaxy, but even Cadillac's experience their share of \\"bad days\\" and Houston has had, shall we say, \\"many, many bad days\\" over the last 15 years.  If I continue, I would probably start to sound like the \\"National Inquirer\\" here.<br /><br />Sorry but true adjectives like \\"hoarse\\" \\"strained\\" \\"abrasive\\" \\"screeching\\" are just some of the words to describe Houston's voice here, a sad shadow of what it once was.  The long time away from the microphone is noticeable in all the tracks following the excellent opener.  Apparently the Grammy folks weren't too keen on this disc either.  When nominations came out for the 2010 Grammys, Houston's \\"I Look to You\\" was shut out in all categories.  Many were surprised by Whitney's snub, but after listening to this disc, I can't say that I'm that surprised.  The ill effects of Houston's personal life had taken their toll on her voice, once deemed \\"the Best in Pop\\".<br /><br />I wish I could say that I LOVE this CD to welcome Whitney back with open arms, but in all honesty, I don't love this disc.  I can't even force myself to use the word \\"like\\".  If I could trade in the entire disc for just the single \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", I would.  It's the only track that resembles what Houston is capable of.  In all respect to her great contribution to the world of music, this disc would probably place near the bottom, marred by all the \\"bumps, dents, and dings\\" that a once beautiful Cadillac can suffer.  That is the sad story that is Whitney Houston.  I don't think even Clive Davis can look in his own heart and say he was happy with the finished product.<br /><br />As summer approaches, I hope we get a better release with Whit's final project, the upcoming \\"Sparkle\\" (due for an August 2012 release) where hopefully her fans can once again have something to celebrate about and pay their final respects to this once beautiful \\"shiny Cadillac\\".  But as this CD stands, that Cadillac is more like a \\"refurbished heap\\" in a junkyard that \\"I Look to You\\" represents.
0062073567|4.0|It was a long time between Agatha reads for me and now I wonder why I've left it so long. That funny little man Poirot is an absolute fav and the way that Ms Christie keeps me guessing right until the very end is amazing, every time she gets me.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pvz worked great on my lg optimus v and I now have it on my kindle fire and it works and saves progress fine. The only bad thing is that it is a little pixellated, but it doesn't interfere with gameplay. You should always read the descriptions for games to see if it specifically notes that your device isn't compatible before you purchase.
0743297334|3.0|Wow, I felt drunk reading this book. The characters consume much alcohol whilst at a bull-fighting fiesta, there's drama between the characters and this can also be shown in the bull-fighting. Due to the fast pace I read this book and the continued mention of alcohol it made my head whirl....and I promise I wasn't drinking at the time.<br /><br />First Hemingway, won't be my last. Very quick read.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I had seen the movie a few times, and just had to have the music to sing along with when driving.

159448385X|3.0|I really think my expectations were too high for this book after reading The Kite Runner previously. It was a good story but didn't hold my interest, I found my mind wandering. It seemed to plod along slowly. It was still okay and maybe if I had read it before The Kite Runner I would have liked it more. Just found myself trying to read through it fast so I could start another book.
0439023491|5.0|You will not be disappointed w/ the sequel to THG. CF is a great book in itself, quick and engaging! Get it, right now!
1439152799|3.0|For starters I will say that it took me some months to read this book.  It started out great, did not hold my interest so much for the middle but did redeem itself in the end.  I can't put my finger on why I felt it lagged for me, perhaps it was that it seemed to be taking too long to explain things and get right into the nitty gritty of the secrets I wanted to find the answers for.  The last hundred pages or so I would rate higher than the rest of the book, everything I wanted in an ending.  I will also say that I read several other books at the same time as reading The Distant Hours and I think it actually made my reading more enjoyable, I was able to appreciate small sections of reading rather than, as when I first started, trying to force that appreciation and enjoyment by reading large sections.  In the end the decision to read other books at the same time made my reading of The Distant Hours a good experience instead of feeling like a chore.<br /><br />I loved the characters, could not pick a favourite.  Each and every character was dealing with their own inner problems and trying to solve their own secrets.  I was eager to find out the ultimate secret but also to see how Edie and her mother's relationship would develop as Edie uncovered intimate secrets about her mother's past.  Fifty years is a long time and a lot of water under the bridge, albeit this water mixed with sand to make mud which stuck to the main characters throughout all their lives.<br /><br />All in all, for me, it was an okay read.  I'm glad I decided to take a more leisurely pace with this one and finish the book instead of racing through it or not finishing it at all.  It certainly hasn't deterred me from other works of Kate Morton.<br /><br />Many thanks to Jess from Allen & Unwin for providing me with a copy of The Distant Hours - thanks, Jess!
0439023521|5.0|I'm a teacher and saw a student reading this book. I asked, \\"Is it good?\\" and he enthusiastically said, \\"YES!\\". That was enough for me to get the book the next day. I was immediately sucked in. I'm sure this review is not the predominately featured one so let me just tell you that it's a quick read and you won't want to put it down. Yes, it does meet the hype!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I don't read a whole lot of science fiction, which is probably why I liked this book.  It is obviously set in the future, but that future doesn't have a whole lot more technology than we do now.  It was all pretty familiar, including the characters, the society and the whole shebang.  It was an entertaining story and I read the whole thing without losing interest.  I can't remember what I paid for it because the price seems to change frequently, but it was worth $10-15 anyhow.  Kept my ever-thinking mind quiet for a bit :)
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay is the weakest book in the series, w/out a doubt. I found myself scratching my head in many sections and even though I was happy in the very end, the getting there part angered me. If you're at the point where you've read the first two, no doubt you must finish the trilogy but be prepared to be disappointed.

B0041KKYGU|1.0|I just finished watching this really bad movie and thought I'd jump over to Amazon and see what others thought of it. Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can't believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth. Maybe not even that much. What's next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn't be surprised.

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|This movie is a vehicle for Clooney and he handles a difficult and subtle role well. But the story itself is long, tedious and somewhat cliched. Clooney's character wrestles with his own feelings, how to handle his daughters, the difficult feelings and problematic behavior of others in his dying wife's life. This guy has it tough (emotionally speaking) and he mostly does the right thing. The family seems to pull together in the end. The family property will not be commercially developed either. Well, the scenery is nice.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|How delicious!  The post apocalyptic genre is such a difficult field to write about.  You have succeeded.  I am what you might call a voracious reader of 5 books at least a week.  And I read everything from horror to poetry.  One of my favorite reads over my 55 years is what we used to call \\"post nuclear\\" fiction.  Growing up in Omaha Nebr. and next to SAC we kids knew at a very young age if the missiles launched we would have about 20 mins. to live. I started reading \\"what after\\" books out of curiosity and now its become a passion.<br />Wool is just plain, no bull, excellent!  It has everything a reader could ask for.  Drama, humor, pathos, excitement, evil, good and resignation.  And all written vividly and with great research to the subject.  Reading this in one sitting I didn't want it to stop and I can't wait to read more by this author.  As a woman I always want to see woman in strong roles in books.  Thank you for writing a strong, intelligent woman as one of the main characters!<br /><br />This reminds me of John Wyndham, Robert R. McCammon and M.K. Wren.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I wanted a streamlined, lightweight cover for my Kindle Fire.  This cover is neat and well-designed, and I like the slightly rubbery feeling of its surface.  The ridge on the opening flap can be bent back to create a support if you want to prop up your Kindle.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the fact that the elastic fastener doesn't really keep the cover tightly in place if my Kindle slides around in my bag.  I almost wish that there were another, smaller flap (on the right side of the cover) that would reach over to meet the main flap.  (But then the design wouldn't be quite as streamlined as it currently is.)
0060254920|5.0|With over 500 reviews on this wonderful work as I write this, there is obviously little I can add either positive or negatively that has not already been said...over and over and over again. I will make this relatively short.<br /><br />I do like this book. It has been one of my favorites for a number of years now and I have read it to countless children. There is at least one thing to remember when entering this book; children have a point of view and adults quite often have another. The bottom line here is that most children love this work. They loved it when it was first published and that fondness continues to this day.<br /><br />Now, much depends upon how this work is presented to the little ones. Read correctly it does the job it was meant to do which is entertained the little ones and allow them to stretch their imaginations. It also validates their musings letting them know that they are not the only ones who think strange g things and take wild and wonderful adventures as they lay in their beds at night.<br /><br />The art work in this small book, in my opinion, ranks among the best of the best. The simply told story holds true to the spirit of a young persons (and hopefully, the not so young) imagination. It of course is a Caldecott Medal winner and rightfully so. I am not always in agreement with the books that are chosen to receive this award but I have to tell you that the Caldecott people hit the nail on the head with this one.<br /><br />This has turned into a children's classic and I strongly suspect that it will be with us for many years to come...this is a good thing.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
1612130283|1.0|I was wondering how a \\"risqué\\" fan fiction finally made it mainstream, as I read bad fanfic back in the 90s full of bondage, \\"slash\\", torture, etc and laughed at it all. At 16 and 17 I found it exciting, but I could still see that it wasn't very good.<br /><br />I would rate this three stars if anything had happened; two if the book was free. But it's the same old \\"beautiful but underrated and virginal protagonist finds severely messed up hero and wants to save him\\" BS you can read on any Livejournal and it costs ten bucks. The \\"he loves me, loves me not\\" gets very tedious, as does the \\"kinky\\" abuse - I mean hot sex. It isn't hot, just boring, and it seems now to write a successful teen novel all you need is two emotionally stunted people who are somehow destined to be together and for those people to talk about it back and forth for 300 pages and then never commit.<br /><br />I don't mean to dis the author; lots of us write bad fanfic. In fact, I am super jealous! It is a fanfic writer's dream come true, and if we are honest, any writer's dream come true to have this kind of exposure. Once again the Internet is leaking and people have caught wind of it. I just wonder how this particular piece of writing is being made into a movie/ being talked about by everyone. All you have to do is change the names to a huge amount of the mediocre \\"erotic\\" fanfic written in the past 20 years and you have things like this. It's all over the place - from what I heard on the radio about this story, I thought it would be really risque, and honestly, I've seen more scandalous things on HBO's Real Sex ten years ago. How this differs from the smut already out there, I have no idea.<br /><br />I didn't hate \\"reading\\" 50 Shades, but I did skim A LOT of flirting, orgasming and e-mailing. I just was so bored. Hopefully they will add some sort of actual conflict to the movie, like having Christian's relationship with this young nobody needing to be a secret from the public or something. Myhat's off to the author, and a hearty \\"good luck\\" to anyone reading this novel who set out to be entertained.

Just read the preview of the first few pages and you will get an idea of the author's sense of humor.  Other than that, there are some great tips in there.  I really like section at the end with specific photo styles and then kind of a short step by step on \\"how to take this type of photo\\".

0140157352|4.0|I have read \\"Getting to Yes\\" several times and I believe that it is an important negotiation book with key insights that might seems all too obvious to us but in reality these insights and messages are lost in the heat of the negotiation (or some may call it the argument).<br /><br />I think that if I could only recommend 3 key insights from the book I will highlight the following:<br /><br />1. Separate the people from the problem and the method of controlling our emotions and egos from getting the best (worst) of the negotiation<br />2. The ability of focusing on the other side interest and not his position<br />3. Deciding ahead of the negotiation what will be your \\"backup plan\\" or as stated in the book, Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)<br /><br />The book also provides some key techniques to identify and handle difficult negotiator (like the ones who pull dirty tricks). The only drawback that I have is that I think the book although quite generic is a better suit for business or larger scale negotiation and not so much for day to day interaction or consumer oriented negotiation.<br />If you are looking more on day to day influencing and negotiating with people I would recommend the following 2 books: Dale Carnegie famous \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" and Roberto Ciadini fantastic work at \\"Influence\\", both of these books have many more real life personal examples than \\"Getting to Yes\\".<br /><br />Amir Avitzur<br />Author of \\"Why do we sell low and buy high?

B0050XFY4O|5.0|FROM BEGINNING TO END (Do Começo ao Fim) is the work of writer/director Aluzio Abranches who was born and raised in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He graduated in Economics before going to the London International Film School, in 1983. His first feature-film, 'Um Copo de C&oacute;lera' (1999) was acclaimed in several international film festivals. In 2002 his second feature-film, As três Marias (The Three Marias) also was selected to various festivals abroad. His latest movie, 'Do Começo ao Fim' (From Beginning to End) tells a story about two male half-brothers who fall in love. The movie caused tremendous controversy as some people loved the delicate relationship between them and others who were outraged by the suggestion of incest. Nevertheless, it is undeniable it was groundbreaking for the homosexual Brazilian cinematography, being selected to over 25 international film festivals, many of them dedicated to the gay pride and film production.<br /><br />Though the feelings of viewers continues to be quite mixed, hopefully in time the film as an art work will be better appreciated.  It is an exquisite study of family in a different light than any other film has probed.  Julieta (J&uacute;lia Lemmertz) is currently married to Alexandre (F&aacute;bio Assunção) and they have a child Thom&aacute;s who according to the narrator - the half brother Francisco from Julieta's pervious marriage to Pedro (Jean Pierre Noher) - was born with his eyes closed and kept them closed except for looking at his new brother.  Into this loving atmosphere the two brothers are close, enjoying each other's company in play and adventures and proximity. Francisco as a child is played by Lucas Cotrim and Thom&aacute;s as a child is played by Gabriel Kaufmann. Thom&aacute;s idolizes his big brother and Francisco looks to Thom&aacute;s for secure love.  The boys visit Pedro (Francisco's father) in Buenos Aires at Christmas and Pedro discusses with Julieta that he is concerned that the boys are too close, a fact that Julieta acknowledges but assures Pedro that this is normal in boys their age. At home in Rio de Janeiro Alexandre poses the same concern, but the two young boys are so happy and successful in school and sports that the subject is dropped.  Pedro dies, then Julieta dies, and the two now grown young lads have only their shared father Alexandre to parent them. As young very handsome, athletic men Francisco (now played by João Gabriel Vasconcellos) and Thom&aacute;s ( Rafael Cardosa) are left alone in their home and their relationship deepens into a physical one. The lads deeply love each other and their physical love is as wondrously portrayed as their love as half brothers.  They exchange rings. They both are dedicated swimmers, but Thom&aacute;s is better and is offer to go to Russia to train for the Olympics.  The idea of separation deeply troubles them both, but Francisco's love for Thom&aacute;s sees the importance to his brothers career and off Thom&aacute;s goes to Russia.  While the lads are separated they yearn for each other: Francisco attempts to assuage his longing with a young girl but his commitment to Thom&aacute;s is stronger.  The film ends in a statement of commitment and love between these two extraordinary men.<br /><br />The physical aspects of the relationship are beautifully captured in the sensitive cinematography by Ueli Steiger: the acts are passionate but visually subtle.  The musical score by Andr&eacute; Abujamra adds another realm of power to the story's character.  Each of the actors in the film is excellent. It is rare that broken family stories have been shared with such grace and delicacy. And both Vasconcellos and Cardoso seem to have a fine career ahead of them.<br /><br />FROM BEGINNING TO END should not be labeled as a gay film even though it allows the viewer to see the power of same sex relationships in a beautifully described new light.  This is, simply, a fine film and Aluzio Abranches deserves kudosfor his accomplishment.  Grady Harp, April 12

0062060562|2.0|Rarely do I read books that are not considered \\"good literature\\" or challenging reading, but some of the reviews of this novel made me curious. BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is melodramatic, redundant and predictable. Good books challenge me, but this one I sped read the last 175 pages just to get to through it, to get to the end thinking that there would be some \\"deus ex machina\\" ending. Did not happen. I found the premise completely implausible, but because of the author's premise, it locked the author into a defined plot line with very few choices. I was hoping the end would have some modicum of originality and unpredictability, but not so. The problem with this book is that there is no conflict. What conflict there is is NOT revealed until the last five pages! So the novel put me to sleep, BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP. The only reason that I finished reading it was because I paid for the hardcover. This entire book should have been distilled down to a tight, thrilling short story.
B00637HXNG|5.0|My DVD had a manufacturing defect. It played  the video and audio for songs 1 - 10 perfectly but songs 11 -21 would freeze/skip.  Unfortunately I was past the 30-day limit for a full refund by the time I played the DVD past song 10 so I am out of luck - Amazon will not give me a full refund and won't pay shipping - so it is not worth the effort to send it back.  Beware - of the manufacturing defects!<br /><br />Important Update:<br />The DVD did not have a defect - it was a problem with may Samsung DVD firmware; firmware needed to be upgraded.<br /><br />Although my Samsung DVD is only 1 year old, it required a firmware upgrade in order to play the \\"Scorpions<br />Live in 3-D\\" correctly. After downloading the new software/firmware to a USB drive from the Samsung support site and<br />installing it, the Scorpions DVD worked correctly.  It really confused me  that the DVD would play normally on the first 10 tracks and then have problems starting at track 11, which made me think it was a manufacturing<br />defect - but it really was a firmware problem.<br /><br />My guess is this \\"Scorpions Live in 3-D\\" was recorded using leading-edge Blue Ray technology all customers should upgrade their firmware.<br /><br />Great DVD - superb audio and video and I am only watching it in 2-D!
B00701QVVY|5.0|my first introduction to Overkill was in the early 90's, with WFO and i wasnt impressed at all. later i found out i've been introduced to this band with the wrong album<br />when i heard 'feel the fire' and 'years of decay'. then i got 'horrorscope'... and i was hooked. after 'wrecking everything' i was wondering why the heck is this band so underrated? why is it left out of the big four while a rap metal thingy like anthrax or a country-flavored metallica are still considered 'thrash'?????<br />horrorscope is thrash. The Electric Age is thrash. the latest 3-4 megadeth/metallica/anthrax albums are NOT thrash.<br />bobby blitz ellsworth and co. are like a very fine wine, and by now i've played The Electric Age for about 12 times this week. it spits fire, it sparks energy, it's heavy and powerful but light on its feet. Overkill is one of the safest bets in metal today. you KNOW they're gonna deliver and that your money will be well spent. you want metal, and this baby here has it in droves.<br />for me, the current big 4 are slayer, overkill, testament and heathen.

B0073ODRKG|5.0|This is an amazing set in any way you see it!!! It's true that there are here better albums than others that Madonna has released during all her career and it is also true that here you won't find the compilations that she has put out either. But most of her great work is here all together for you to enjoy. I would say that from the \\"so beloved\\" 80's decade my favorite albums are definitely \\"Madonna\\" (1983) and the amazing \\"True blue\\" (1986) being her first true album that showed her real talent if you ask me.  Maybe \\"Like a virgin\\" (1984) was a fun record too and \\"Like a prayer\\" (1989) was her first record to bring controversy to whom we knew was going to stay for a while but, honestly these are not really my favorite albums from her, I love songs like \\"like a virgin, like a prayer (of course!!!) and, material girl\\" tough.<br /><br />The 90's decade showed a more mature Madonna in her ways to act and to make music. This decade also brought us a more controversial Madonna specially with the record \\"Erotica\\" (1992). This album had amazing songs that everybody loved but it isn't really one of my favorites either. Then, two years later \\"Bedtime stories\\" (1994) was released and probably this one was too mellow for me to really enjoy. But once again the songs that were singles here were great too. After a long period without a new record from her, Madonna releases the one and only \\"Ray of light\\" (1998) and this one became the record that made me fall in love with her music for real. This record was so well produced and confectioned that it became in a huge success for Madonna, a total triumph for her without any doubt. \\"Music\\" (2000) was not as amazing as its predecessor for it was accepted for sure. Then, \\"American life\\" (2003) came along and this album was hard to get for many Madonna fans. It was so political and showed a side of<br /> her that no one even knew existed in her music. This album might be called to me her \\"sad\\" record for everything that was going on in the US back then and that Madonna reflected in this record. Don't get me wrong, this is a great album if you ask me...probably one of her best jobs. Just listen to songs like \\"Intervention\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about. Then, this confusion that \\"American life\\" brought in many of her fans Madonna had to release a record that everybody loved and that is exactly what she did with \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" (2005) a record that brought lost kids back to her immediately. This became once again in a huge success for Madonna once again. Finally before her new record was release this year, \\"Hard candy\\" (2008) was released and probably this was another record that put Madonna between love and hate for some people... probably because it had too much of hip hop or rap between the songs that wasn't accepted after all. But once again I must say that I loved this record too. At least is so fun to listen to.<br /><br />If you consider of buying these records separately you'll end up spending more money because even though there are many on sale these days other ones are still pretty expensive for being considered \\"classics\\" of course. But if yup get this box set you'll save tons of money and you'll experience by yourself the journey that represents Madonna's career for almost 30 years already.the US back then and that Madonna reflected in this record.

B0068RHSCW|2.0|Dream House<br /><br />A decent thriller with a superb cast, 'Dream House' will interest the viewer until the final 15 minutes. The big problem is that the production rushes the ending and the observant viewer will feel that something is missing; a transition sequence that brings the viewer and the main character into the action of the final scenes. I felt that there must have been more scenes written for Jane Alexander's character that would have offered the bridge scenes necessary to allow the audience to absorb the direction that the plot was heading. To understand what I am getting at, watch a similar film directed by one of our greatest directors; Martin Scorsese, titled 'Shutter Island'. I do not want to reveal the plot of 'Dream House', but if you watch 'Shutter Island, particularly, the last 15 minutes, you will understand what I mean.<br /><br />In any case. perhaps I have watched too many movies or perhaps my subconscious remembered the preview trailer, because I got the gist of the plot after watching the first 5 minutes. There was something off about the opening sequences that I noticed immediately and this was confirmed after watching the first scenes with the family and I began to compare it to an older film that starred Nicole Kidman. You probably know the one I mean.<br /><br />Still, 'Dream House' is a good film that deserved a better critical reception than it got during it's original release. It is a minor effort by a very good director, Jim Sheridan. I do not know why he choose the direction that the plot unfolds before us. It is lame and easily guessed from the beginning. It would have been a much better film if the audience was in on the main plot points from the start of the film (I understand that the preview trailer revealed it anyway) and that the viewer  knew the basic plot line that the main character was so clueless about. It would have made a better film if the audience became engrossed in Daniel Craig's character discovery about the truth about his past and his delusions. And it would have eliminated the need to have other secondary characters speak dialogue and take actions that make absolutely no sense. For this reason, the film might be better if you watched it a second time.
B006470HZ6|4.0|I feel Season 2 is far superior to Season 1. Call me crazy but I like my TV shows to have some depth. In the first season, I barely knew the characters' names, let alone cared if they died. It was like watching a cheap Syfy movie back then. Now I'm invested. It's not simply about killing zombies. It's about survival. That includes the zombie apocalypse as well as the breakdown of civilization and humanity as the characters know it. Watching them adjust to their new world and slowly giving up hope in a way back to what they used to know, that's compelling stuff. It IS on AMC after all, not on Syfy between SuperExplodingJellyfish and HauntedPlumbingBusters. That wasn't a pot-shot to the whole channel, though. Some shows I watch. Anyway, Season 3 should be awesome if they combine story lines and zombies. The end of Season 2 looks promising.
B000W00Y0Y|3.0|I read the rave reviews on Amazon and ordered it. It was a disappointment and I guess the reviewers here must be die-hard Queen fans.<br /><br />I was a Queen sort-of-fan back in London when the band was just starting out. Back then I saw them twice. Once before they became well known (when they released keep yourself alive to little acclaim) and then again a few years later at the free concert in Hyde Park. I always thought that they weren't very good live. The beautiful melodies in their brand of 'fairy tale' rock that were the hallmark of Queen and Queen 2 albums, just could not be produced live. Live they just came across as a fairly harsh pop-influenced heavy rock band. Mercury simply could not reproduce his studio voice on stage.<br /><br />Nothing in this Blu Ray changes my opinion. Decades later I have played the records of classic Queen tracks to my kids and they have enjoyed them. But when I put this disc on, all I saw on their faces was disappointment at how unpleasant the live versions of the songs are.<br /><br />Particularly telling is the way that half way through Bohemian Rhapsody, the band disappears and a recording takes over (no kidding)! I know its hard to do live, but c'mon, hire some singers, get some professional vocalists to join in or something. Don't just disappear from the stage while a recording takes over!<br /><br />So, good quality video, yes. Good quality sound, yes. Good quality musicianship, hardly. If you think I'm being harsh get the Pink Floyd or Roger Waters DVDs. You will see there how its done. Immaculate musicianship which sounds as good as any studio album. Sure Waters can's sing much, but he gets musicians on stage who can take over when he would strain. It can be done. Queen doesn't do it.
159514188X|5.0|I lost my best friend to suicide in May of 2011. I read this just after she passed away, maybe a month or two after, when I could finally get out of bed. While this book is very dark and angry, it's a great read for anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide. However, I don't mean to say that all who commit suicide are as angry as the character in this book. If anything it just gives you an insight to your impact on others around you and if you are a critical thinker, that others may need help when you don't realize. I would highly recommend this book to anyone dealing with the loss or thoughts of suicide.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Received this light for Christmas and it's Amazing!  The feel, balance, and ergonomics are perfect.  The switches and functions are easy to use even with gloves on.  The build quality is superb and it feels very tough!  It has gold plated battery terminals and never flashed out when bumped.  The light levels are prefect for several tasks.  I also love that this light runs long and performs well using off the shelf alkaline AA's as I've been using the same batteries for 4 months without any degradation in performance.  IMO this beats other lights which require 18650 batteries at this brightness level.  I highly recommned this light for every home!  It's the size of a standard 2 D-Cell light and easy for anyone to wield.  I donated 5 other LED flashlights promptly after I received this one, they didn't hold a candle to it.  Stop reading and BUY IT ALREADY!  You won't be disappointed in the least!  It's also insanely bright when you need to investigate what went \\"bump\\" in the night.

Some folks might call it art or \\"moody,\\" but it's just boring and a sodding waste of time and money.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that will show a 20-second clip of the lead actor sitting in a random chair, in a random room, for some unknown reason, with no sounds or background music and then change scenes to the lead character riding in a car. It was a type of movie that was popular in the 1970's... very Woody Allenish.<br /><br />Then you have the fact that all the actors have very thick Brit accents, and they all talk so softly and quickly that you can't understand a word they're saying. The entire first 30 minutes either showed scenes with no sound whatsoever, or it showed a couple Brits engaging in normal Brit conversation that only Brits can really understand. In half an hour, I understood that the movie was about the hunt for a spy in the higher ranks of British intelligence, but pretty much everything else that was said in the movie either didn't register as comprehensive, or it didn't add to the story line whatsoever.<br /><br />And, then you have the scene of three men in a car, as shot from behind the rear of the car as it supposedly sped down an artificial (green screen) highway. Not only was nothing said in the car, but the entire scene was of the backs of the three men's heads in the car. If I wanted to watch a movie to see the backs of men's heads, I'd watch... well... this one, I guess.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you love moody, melodramatic, slow-moving period dramas with crappy jazz for background music and listening to old British men talk about nothing exciting, you will love this movie. But, if that doesn't describe your movie interests, save your money for something more exciting. I'm extremely disappointed with this film.

0345803485|1.0|I was so excited to read this book - especially after a friend of mine told me how wonderful it was. All I can say is that I'm shocked that so many people give this book rave reviews. How??? I really find this so hard to believe.<br /><br />While the plot is simply OK, the writing is absolutely terrible. If I had to read \\"Oh my\\" one more time, followed closely by the biting of the lower lip, I would have thrown my Kindle out the window. The plot was so loosely structured that it just felt very weak, but I actually found the terrible writing to be the most distracting aspect of the whole thing.<br /><br />I am a voracious reader, but I wouldn't say that I read only \\"high quality\\" novels. I love a good quick read as much as the next person. Unfortunately, this was just awful. I actually got the preview for the second book on my Kindle because my friend told me it was \\"even better\\" than the first book. When I started reading Oh My again and listening to how she needed to stop biting her lip, I knew I couldn't read it. I am just shocked that so many people thought this was actually a good book. I have read hundreds of books, and this is by far one of the worst ones. Don't waste your time or money.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|As usual I headed over to the 1 star review section to see what those folks had to say about this book before posting my own 5 star take on the events. The ones I read fascinated me because it seems like me and those people read two different books. Some called this book boring, predictable and cliche. Really? Seriously? The only thing I found typical is the fact that the main character is torn between two guys like the main female character of nearly every young adult book that's out right now. But the comparisons stop there. Even the way she's caught between them is unique rather than the typical empty minded boy crazy girls you read about now that flit from guy to guy simply going on about how good they look or how much they long to have sex with them. A lot of the one stars just seemed like haters, plain and simple. If the book was so boring, why did they continue reading it instead of just putting it down after a chapter or two. There's even a horrible parody book of The Hunger Games in circulation now and all I can say is that has to be a first. A book has a parody?? I've never heard of that happening! You know you're book is huge when there's someone taking time out of their life to try and make another version of your book! The parody is bad, by the way, just in case you're wondering. I read a few pages and felt sorry for not only the author, but the publishers who paid them because they didn't have anything to do.<br /><br />As far as this book goes, I was crying by the second or third chapter. Not boo-hooing or anything severe, but this book is very touching. Unless you're a heartless prick, this book will touch you in certain areas. If Suzanne Collins got her idea of this from somewhere else, I've never heard of it, and I've never read anything quite like this. This book is like The Help (the book, not the movie)--in that I believe it deserves all the good praise it gets. I'm pretty sure the movie will not be as good as this book, but I'm dying to see it anyway. At least Suzanne Collins had a hand in writing the script, unlike some, so at least a lot of the basic concepts are kept. Not only that, but I'm dying to read the second book of the trilogy. Do yourself a favor and read this. Ignore the negativity, you'll be glad you did.anyway.

A cowboy seeking his identity while shooting UFO's with his arm zapper.  I really didn't think it would be as good as it was, but sit down and find out who wins, the Cowboys or the aliens!

0439023521|5.0|This book was perfect, everything I love about reading. It brought me into this fantastic world of survival, friendship, love and self discovery. The story line was brilliant, easy to read and follow, and left me wanting more. Thank goodness there are two more! Even though a busy mom, this book only took a couple of days to read and was the perfect distraction. I recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to read.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Cinder.. A Cyborg Cinderella?<br /><br />Ya kinda. There is Cinder, the adopted daughter who is made to toil and work like a slave, and evil stepmother, evil stepsister (one sister that is more sympathetic to her as well), and of course, a handsome prince.<br /><br />But this book was also very reminiscent of Anastacia as well with a little Star Wars. I would have added a spoiler to the prior sentence, but I figured it out pretty early in the book, and so will most if not all of you that read it.<br /><br />The concept of a futuristic Cinderella story did not deter me much; I am quite open to read anything and see for myself, though some of the reviews did give me pause. But not for long, and glad it didn't.<br /><br />The world building and character development in this story was pretty exemplary. I didn't lose my way through a too futuristic world that I would have a hard time having a concept of. In fact, it was pretty clear to me what it all looked like, and what was going on. The author, though, didn't spend too much time on explaining a complex world, because it really was not that complex. The development of the characters and plot were the focus, and was done well. I immediately sympathized with Cinder and her different plights; she had it rough. Not to mention, not having any memory of your life prior to 11 years of age? But she was still a kind, non-complaining, strong but humble female character that was appealing.<br /><br />No ending tied in a bow here. The author definitely left it wide open for a continuation. My only complaint is having to wait for the next part of the series so I can find out if there is a Happy Cinderella Ending after all...

B006PTL1QM|4.0|Last evening I watched the film.<br />I have read Freud and Jung. Not completely, perhaps before I really understood either, not that I can understand either-but I mean to say I read them in connection to my work in art and my interest in creativity in my twenties. I have read biographies of their lives as well. So -the interest in this content was already there for me. They don't have to sell it-if I could I'd visit all the places of their lives. Learn more, read more. I would like to own The Red Book in reproduction actually. So I've wanted to see this movie since I saw a preview in the theater. It is the story of Jung early in his career, his relationship with Freud and their break, and a woman (Sabina Spielrein) who was Jung's first psychoanalytic patient. She apparently factored in this break in ways I did not know, nor have I ever read or heard of. In a way this was almost deflating-how could I have missed such stuff? (The acting of the three main characters btw was fascinating and unlike what I would have pictured- if pressed to explain I would respond that neither of them (Jung or Freud) had I pictured in this cerebral, refined, rather finished gentle way-and that the actress seemed to struggle almost with Tourette's or some straightjacket the rest of us couldn't see which was I hope both a liberty and a device meant to stand for the distancing mental illness produces-it achieved that effect)<br /><br />The role of this first psychoanalytic patient in Jung's life trajectory seems immense- as told here- I recall somewhere in my reading someone who was an analysist, perhaps Jung, talking of how that 1st patient is so important and thus so memorable-then I would imagine kept alive in their work rather like I will always recall the first class I taught. Not being in the field I can only relate through my lens of perception. Perhaps I missed that they became sexually involved-he and his 1st patient- in what I have read. That shocked me. I didn't even realize how she went on to be such an incredible contributor in psychoanalysis,was his assistant,then taking psychoanalysis to Russia, and herself by then a psychiatrist. That he lent her such a role in his work-certainly as talking partner- made me think of a mirror-I'm sorry -it just did. And my brief fleeting thought was I bet he had many. It was fascinating to learn of all of this.<br /><br />I recently have been talking and thinking about the death instinct and the creative life force in male intimacy- reading about it-to so quickly be directed to the root of the formulation of this theory via the person he analyzed and her contribution of this to the work they developed- struck me as quite a coincidence-I began reading him because I wanted to better understand creative drives as well as surviving abuse within creativity,<br />The movie also explores triangulation- actually that as much as anything else-and I have no idea if that is accurately what happened. Triangulation is everywhere in it. Infidelity, love, needs, the nature of repression, rejection, wounds, truth, psychiatry, boundaries, healing, sexuality, historical perspectives, evolution of ideas, science and myth, individuation-a host of themes touched upon.<br /><br />I think a woman's need for the healing force of two of the greatest psychiatrists that ever lived indicates really the amazing person this girl was-or they were. For basically they both took her seriously and in their own way cared for her.My thought was sexualizing the relationship with Jung-mistake, but at least the movie bears that out false for both of them. Ultimately her fulfillment as a doctor healing her. There are things here I haven't yet worked out, and places where thins get too close to my own stuff for me to work it out easily.<br />And if this plot line isn't the revealing of the nature of triangles what would that be?<br />They are prey to their feelings in this movie, to their actions, to the dominate themes of the time, science versus mysticism for instance is discussed,  they analyze everything, they look at their histories, they explore their dream contents, they adjust the thinking,they deny, they hide truths, they reveal, they are human, they sort through the dynamics of their living-looking at what is driving them. Time figures in the story. It touches on how Freud and Jung were not the same in orientation, how the dynamics between them revealed both of their weaknesses. Especially Jung-who seems seen by Freud.<br />I suppose in the end what struck me was their bravery to face their feelings, continue trying-even when Jung is basically just portrayed here as a coward in his relationship to Sabina- and in his marriage-a coward- that likes the wife's money- still they are present with one another.Imperfections shown. Their importance to one another is presented in what must have been some sticky stuff.<br /><br /> In this way the movie becomes rather like the opening up to discussion in repressive times of what a woman might want, what the effect of the times might breed for such an intelligent woman, to be so desired and yet to move forward and develop not as a subordinate or object alone- and finally it seems to hold her own intellectually-that was interesting. Sabina Spielrein clearly was greatly wounded, a healer herself, and these three great individuals are placed within their times dynamics one hopes accurately, you hope- so we can see the development of their methods in analysis fairly. (She will later be shot with her children,by the Nazi's which was a tragic thing to read in the last brief notes- the men having fuller careers-but all shaped by times foreshadowed here with Jung's apocalyptic dream.)<br />It's a love story, it's a loss story, it's a growth story, it's actually perhaps an intellectual and historical journey as well.<br />(I could have done without the spanking scenes, but I think that's because they seemed so privacy invading, impossible, and suggestive of titillating-and would scandalize about a half of the folks that might happen upon the movie. And I doubt them. I understood them within the context of displaying the unbounded nature of their relationship and exploration of the destructive force of sexuality she had in play from childhood-in the notion of their exploration of taboo subjects-but it came across grossly)<br /><br />So essentially Jung had an affaire with a patient, with a first patient, and I suppose that's pretty significant to understand in his evolution, that his work was as much about his own insights into self as patients health-as his process. I saw in the movie at times the flashes of their equality, the wounds within him, the strange compartment for his wife, the triangulation over Sabina with Freud, Also with his wife and work,  Sabina's role in their split (Jung/Freud which I have never heard before in anything I've read), (reading later of her fate after the movie)-at least for me a movie abruptly ended....it is all grist for the mill....I think the movie distorts the man-super normalizing him here via a very sweet performance, but...<br /><br />I never pictured Jung so wealthy either, but I knew that his wife was wealthy, nor him so beautiful and in such magnificently beautiful surroundings, so in the movie this felt false against my inner eye -distant and perfected or idealized-definitely idealized, tribute like- but looking at pictures later I thought perhaps this was carefully considered -certainly the quotes used as dialog throughout the movie were placed in key moments to stay with you directly from the letters.. I revise those images to move him even further from things I can understand-the luxury and station of his life...but surely there would be some quibbling about Carl Jung as seen here.<br />And finally, this was a relationship that their letters revealed and it was a movie based upon them. One of the fantasies or  themes of my life was a wish to have such intimacy with others through writing and experiences, to know such a closeness, to share feelings, insights, the stuff of life with another in that way-clearly these letters were the correspondence of three people that took the time, knew the significance, allowed the relating in this form to connect them. There are several movies that I love in which letters are the basis of the movie. The Anne Bancroft one with the bookseller-The Turtle Diaries among them. It would seem that these movies deeply affect me. They represent something for me- the deep connection in word. Somehow in my fantasy, or my conceptions of love, of the secrets inside us-letters, correspondence, the revealing-it is a piece of why this movie worked for me-perhaps psychologically.<br />How different a movie it might have been had these men simply rejected Sabina Spielrein, denied her importance to them, never written another word to her in their fear of scandal, and simply we were left with none of these records. It would seem they put the thing to pen because they were brave enough to at least on some level face and work through it -that seems such an act of care and love.<br />Interesting movie.ng-and would scandalize about a half of the folks that might happen upon the movie.

I'm not a real classical fan but decided to give a listen when they were on TV and am I glad I did!!!  They're not really classical but have a totally new cutting edge sound that's really exciting.  Having seen them perform \\"Cool Criminal\\" was a big plus for me and I really wanted more!!  Total pop on cellos...who'd a' thunk it??

I cannot begin or pretend to even comprehend the inhumanity and cruelty that Shin, and all the others suffering in the camps, have had to endure. Shin's story is heartbreaking, touching, inspiring and motivating beyond words. The atrocities that go on in North Korea are appalling! Shin escaped a government who forsakes, persecutes and massacres its own people, then denies the existence of that very brutality! I have been telling everyone I know about this book! It is a must read and will change your life!

0307959856|4.0|This is superb continuation of the cast of Pride and Predjudice's story.The mystery was weird and did not end the way I predicted and I prefer it that way.  I liked that she fleshed Darcy and Wickham out to make them more human. She covers a lot about English culture that this American girl would have never known about otherwise.The little details, such as Elisabeth sticking two differant kinds of flowers in vases made this book stand out.I usually do not say this ,but the book was not long enough. She had a lot of ground and characters to cover and a lot of loose ends were left undone. Sometimes I was not sure who was speaking, because of the large amount of characters. Otherwise, I enjoyed devouring this in one evening.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a multitude of great games in one.you can keep playing and it never be the same.. recomend this for everyone.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|I haven't read the book, because I have too many other books ahead of it. This is not a cheesy tween romance film. Also it was refreshing to see a young woman who does not look like an anorexic twig. It is pretty dark and there was one scene when a man was eaten alive by dogs that I had to look away. This film has some real heart to it. Like when a fellow player in the hunger games is killed, Katniss lays her on a bed of flowers and sings to her.<br /><br />I hope they win something for costume design at Oscar Time. The designs of the apartment Katness and Peta stay reminded me of the Jetsons house and the beautiful spread of food made me sorry I did not eat beforehand. Katness and Prim's vintage looking dresses were stunning and the Lady Gaga type stylings for Elisabeth Banks and the upper class were awe inspiring. The producers left nothing hanging , they tell exactly why Woody Harrelson's character is a depressed drunk without words . Don't leave when it ends , the music playing during the credits is terrific. Its kind of a mash up of bluesy country and florence and the machine.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the first twenty minutes were boring and the music should have been in the film instead of playing at the credits.
B003NX75B8|1.0|This Book Should Have An Explicit Content Warning! I read the Kindle sample (which is Chapter 1) and that was alright, so I purchased the book. I barely got through Chapter 2 last night before I was so angry that there was no warning on the book review about how lewd this book was going to be, once you got done with the relatively benign sample. I do not want to read about a 16 year old boy constantly masturbating and obsessing over computer cyber-sex with another man.<br /><br />This book was in the \\"Recommended For You\\" section of the Kindle store, probably because I recently read and loved a different John Green book. Regarding this book, though, I want my money back.

How if you choose to be free, it will cost you your life, your family lives, your family's family lives. How the world percieve your nation, and how your nation percieve itself.<br /><br />This book is a remarkable love story. What is love if there is no love that we know? What is hate if you were only train to love what you hated? This books answers those questions. It is a greate read.

I was so impressed I went back on three more occasions, and fell more and more in love with the production, and the fact that you can now view it on BlueRay is like icing on the cake.

B000QCS8TW|2.0|It has taken me 4 years to get maybe 1/4th of the way through the book. I'll admit that the writing style is fine. The story line is fine. There isn't any thing in particular that I don't like about it. But, I just can't get interested enough in it to continue. I have the audio version, so maybe it is the narrator that is ruining it. I don't know if I'll try to finish it or not. At this point I can't recommend it, again, not because of any failing other than it can't hold my interest.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I honestly had high hopes for this album.  I buy pretty much all new Bruce records as they come out.  The cut \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" is solid classic sounding Bruce with a good hook and an uplifting message. The rest of the record is just dull and forgettable in my opinion.  I'm not sure what he was going for here (even after reading the Rolling Stone interview). The lyrics are decent.  These message is there. However, most of the songs are missing a good musical element.  It seems like Bruce is becoming more and more of a poet, but forgetting about the need for energetic, creative and catchy chord progressions and hooks. Just my opinion, but I'll definitely be listening to samples of all of the tracks before buying his next album. That said, I can see how some people might appreciate this album.  If you like Bruce's more downbeat, roots folksy style, you could get into this record. I prefer Bruce when he rocks.  This album only has a couple rocking moments.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|First off, I'll admit it, I skipped book one. Thus, I've only read A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, the book I'm reviewing here. All told I believe Storm of Swords to be a much better book than it's predecessor. Clash of Kings felt slow and ponderous. It was still engrossing enough to make roughly 1,000 pages fly by in a matter of days, but when I sat back at the end I thought \\"Wow, I just read all that and barely anything happened!\\" With Storm it's the exact opposite.<br /><br />So much happened in this book it made my head spin. Characters were handled like expensive porcelain dolls in Clash, many escaping without a single crack, but in Storm many characters actually die. I'll admit some of the deaths seemed wanton, but others were very satisfying. Some people might want every single death to have a deep meaning, but I think it adds realism to the series to have some ends feel pointless, and some feel poignant.<br /><br />But it's not all about death. God forbid, some good things happen as well! More than a few characters actually move up in the world! There's also tons of character development in Storm; I have a much different view of many of the characters than I did on page one.<br /><br />All I can say is...get this book. If you felt Clash to be a bit ponderous like I did, then have no fear because Storm kicks the action into high gear. Don't stop reading either, no matter how dark it gets, I promise you won't regret it.
0517548232|5.0|You are basically only going to read this book if you are required to in school or have some interest in learning the basics of Austrian economics. I fall into the later one.<br /><br />I picked this book up a few years ago to gain a basic understanding of Austrian economics. In this aspect the book is perfect. This is the first economics book I read outside of a college text book. It delivers some stories and helps you understand how one economic policy affects the lives of everyday people. I found the book to be easily readable. It is not as complicated as I thought a economics book had to be, nothing like a college economic's text book.<br /><br />The book generally helps you understand how a economic policy is meant to help one group of people will affect another. The book urges the reader to think more clearly about these policies by looking at the unseen problems it will create for other groups of people. The first chapter outline's this perfectly.<br /><br />I did go into reading this book with a already set Libertarian political view on most issues and wanted to better understand Austrian economics. You will understand it more after reading this book.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Wow, I can't believe no one has commented on this movie! I saw it back when it first came out in theatres. It was exceptionally well done. Jim Caviezel's acting was superb and Mel Gibson did a wonderful job directing this film. I cried so much during this movie.<br /><br />I will warn everyone right now: this movie is not suitable for ALL members of the family. If you're going to watch this with your children, word of advice: it is EXTREMELY violent. I can't even begin to describe how violent it is. Furthermore, there are some scenes that are just SO scary, that for this reason also, I would advise people to not show this to children under the age of 13, and even then, you should be extremely cautious.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this movie is absolutely exceptional and if you're looking to watch a movie that depicts Jesus's passion, this movie will satisfy! I love this movie, and I highly recommend it.
B005LAII0S|5.0|It's a fun ride.<br /><br />With over 35 films to her credit, Julia Roberts gives one of her best performances. This might come as a surprise. America's Sweetheart as the Evil Queen. But the actress goes for broke and has a great time doing it. She doesn't play the Queen we grew up with from the fairytale. She goes further and because of that, it's a lot more fun and interesting. Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane are terrific and Lilly Collins manages to look pretty, but lacks a screen charisma that is needed. Luckily, this is Roberts' show and she is everything the movie needs to be.<br /><br />The visuals are terrific and the costumes are some of the best designs that I've seen in a film in years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really really fun game to play. you will love it just like me and my family. have fun playing
B0000DYKET|5.0|Bought these just before leaving on a 3 month trip to Sierra Leone with my university. The Newports never left my feet throughout the entire trip. I can not imagine how I would have tolerated 12+ hours on my feet everyday without these. They were comfortable, durable, and protective.<br /><br />These were my first Keens and never again will I own sandals from another company. Thank you Keen!
B007FH9GT2|1.0|the \\"girl\\" barely shows up till the second half, the plot is incoherent.  This is just a bad movie with a big budget.  Too bad
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is even better than the first with new catches, obstacles, and bubbles! very cheap for the amount of fun ull hve and the graphics r kickass.
0316044695|5.0|What a great book, I picked it up and could not stop reading it.  I don't read a lot of books, most usually take me a month to finish, I finished this in a weekend.  If you always wondered what kind of men Navy Seals are, this will explain it to you word for word.
B000UDJS2S|3.0|Nicolas Cage is a comic book fan (Cage took his stage name from Luke Cage, one of the first Black Superheroes. Nick and his wife, Alice Kim Cage, had a son, Kal-el Coppola Cage, named after the comic book character \\"Kal-el\\" (aka Superman)) and collector, and a fan of the Ghost Rider comic book in particular; so he really wanted to do this movie. Too bad the director was Mark Steven Johnson, also responsible for Daredevil. Both movies are pretty lame and it makes you wonder if perhaps the comic book based action movie is not Johnson's forte. He made a big mistake in casting a guy to play the young Johnny Blaze who frankly didn't look a thing like a young Nicolas Cage. Hadn't he seen Valley Girl (1983)? Perhaps it was the vanity of Nicolas Cage that pressured him into it, to cut the director some slack, but the guy didn't look like Nicolas Cage at all to the point that it was hard to follow the plot. He looked more like a young Blackheart, the villain who was played by Wes Bentley.<br /><br />I think that there would be two kinds of people that would like this movie if it were done right: Fans of straight-ahead action movies and fans of quirky cult films. In other words, fans of Charlie Kaufman or fans of his twin brother Donald Kaufman (both of whom were played by Nicolas Cage in Adaptation.). I can't speak for the Donald Kaufman fans, but us Charlie Kaufman fans were sorely disappointed. There were numerous moments where opportunities for cool allusions to classic cult films arose, but they were tossed aside like ravaged kleenexes.<br /><br />For starters, Mephistopheles was played by none-other than the Easy Rider himself: Peter Fonda. But Fonda phoned in his portrayal. One of the motorcycles Johnny Blaze rides is based on the Captain America Harley Fonda rode in Rider, but with such a lackluster performance from Peter, who cares? The film opens with expository narration by cult film cowboy Sam Elliott, just as he does in The Big Lebowski (1998). But when he gets fired up to join Johnny Blaze for one last ride his flame peters out before the last round up. What a drag. This would have been a great place to feature Johnny Cash doing Ghost Riders in the Sky, but when they used that song it was by Spiderbait.<br /><br />Cage even did a parody of himself as Sailor in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, but instead of wearing a snake skin jacket which represented a symbol of his individuality, and his belief in personal freedom (this itself is a reference to Marlon Brando as Valentine 'Snakeskin' Xavier in The Fugitive Kind (1959)) and being a huge Elvis Presley fan, Johnny Blaze is a fan of Karen Carpenter?!? Maybe this would be a good place to throw in the fact that Cage IS a big Elvis fan, and, like Michael Jackson, he was once married to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis? Or how about the fact that Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas (1995)?<br /><br />Eva Mendes didn't win no Oscar, but she did play Denzel Washington's wife in Training Day (2001), and Denzel won an Oscar for that. Whenever I see Eva Mendes I think that she looks like an ethnic version of Cindy Crawford. They both have that beauty mark. Other than that, she doesn't impress me much, and even with Cindy's looks, that wasn't enough to make Crawford herself a movie star. In fact, her nadir and her zenith was probably Fair Game (1995) with William Baldwin. The critics took it as a challenge, feeling that it was fair game to trash the super model who thought she could act.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that popcorn action movie fans might like but not love this tepid adaptation, but quirky cult movie fans will shun it like the plague.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002ZG983M Kick-Ass]] (2010)<br />[[ASIN:B001GJ3BPU Daredevil]] (2003)<br />[[ASIN:B004HMLNOO Adaptation]] (2002)<br />[[ASIN:B00062IVM6 Wild at Heart (Special Edition)]] (1990)<br />[[ASIN:B005QBBCMI Leaving Las Vegas]] (1995)<br />[[ASIN:B00005JLFA Valley Girl]] (1983)<br />[[ASIN:B0014DW3OS Training Day]](2001)<br />[[ASIN:B00181JGI2 The Big Lebowski]] (1998)<br />[[ASIN:B000FI8MPW Road House]] (1989)<br />[[ASIN:B000I8ERVC Easy Rider]] (1969)<br /><br />\\"You're stepping on Karen.\\"(2001)<br />[[ASIN:B00181JGI2 The Big Lebowski]] (1998)<br />[[ASIN:B000FI8MPW Road House]] (1989)<br />[[ASIN:B000I8ERVC Easy Rider]] (1969)<br /><br />\\"You're stepping on Karen.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i really liked the book..... my mom bought it for me april 4th 2012 after i begged her for it and i finished it that night…… i can only read  book that quick if im interested in it........ i enjoyed it......
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this movie.  The concept of what to give someone who has everything for their birthday is intriguing.  You give them nothing, or at least the experience of nothing.  I took in this movie with a pair of studio headphones with some good enhancements and didn't miss a single line just in case people wondered if \\"I actually watched the movie\\".  Yes, it all worked out in the end, but to be honest, I probably would not have taken the conclusion as well if this experience happened to me personally.  I would have been filled with wrath that someone would manipulate my emotions like that by making me believe I killed someone close to me regardless of their intentions.  I definitely would not be partying until I could recover my sanity.  That is really the only thing about this movie is how quickly Nick regains his composure after the conclusion.  It just didn't seem realistic.  I think a tad more drama between him and his bro via a shouting match a la \\"How could you do this to me?\\" with everyone looking on in awe should have ensued and maybe tearful verbal explanation bringing up issues from the past that may have affected their present before the big hug would have made it seem a bit more real to me.  However, time is money and they were already over the 2 hour mark so I guess it was a good place to cut the tape.  I won't detract from the movie review though since that is simply my own opinion.
B000Y9YG52|3.0|I ordered this album with high hopes, seeing that this is a very acclaimed LP and often considered to be Anita's finest. But I was disappointed because there is only one good song on here: Sweet Love, her huge hit from this album. the rest of the songs are pretty mediocre. A cheaper way to experience this album would be to get the single of Sweet Love.

0345803485|2.0|Really poorly written.  Impossible to tell who Anastasia is and Christian, well, he's hardly compelling even with his sad story and the manner in which his pants are slung on his hips.  There's no reason to read about these two. They're silly, boring, and their sex isn't all that sexy. Along with a non-existent plot, this book is a real yawn.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|addicting and fun easy to maneuver controls. the kids love it too. great fun to waste some time to. 5 stars!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I purchased the UK version, and have watched all four of the movies in the set.  Of course I haven't seen the USA version, but it will most likely be the same.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this Blu-Ray purchase.  I took notes after watching each of the four movies.<br /><br />I thought the video quality was great.  The first movie didn't have quite as good of video quality as the last three, but it was still very good.  I noticed a little fine grain in some of the scenes in the first movie, but didn't see any in the last three.  In all four of the movies, blacks were black, without grain, and without distortion.  There were a lot of night scenes in the fourth movie, and they all looked great.  Overall, I give the movies an average of 9.4 on a 10.0 scale, with 10.0 being absolutely perfect.  I have never rated a Blu-Ray less than 4.0.<br /><br />Aspect ratio was 2.35:1 or 2.4:1 in the last three movies, and, for some reason, 1.78:1 or 1.85:1 in the first movie.<br /><br />All four of the movies have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is also great.  There is a lot of surround sound, except for the third movie, which doesn't have as much as the other three.  There really isn't much sub-woofer bass, but I did notice more in the fourth movie.<br /><br />Movie 1: 1 hour and 47 minutes.<br />Movie 2: 1 hour and 50 minutes.<br />Movie 3: 1 hour and 54 minutes.<br />Movie 4: 2 hours.<br /><br />All of the movies are very good, but my favorite was the second movie.  There is a 5th disc, but I did not watch any bonus material.
0316056863|5.0|I read this on the plane laughing out loud with tears running down my face!  My seventeen year old son was so embarrassed, but when I showed him passages that I was laughing at he was crying too!  Love, love, loved it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry birds space is sopposed to be really awesome ;and the only reason I did not buy it right away is because my cousin told me it is a really bad game but that why no one.ever listens to him
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is not only boring, it is also utterly annoying. If I wanted a beach-read/lovestory/woman-changes-man trashy novel, I'd be in heaven. And I'd pick that one up as a paperback with my weekly lottery ticket at the convenient store down the street rather than using valuable kindle space.<br /><br />I have to admit that I didn't finish the book. I simply couldn't. If I had to read through one more paragraph starting with \\"holy crap\\", I would have stabbed myself in the eye.<br /><br />So let me start with Anastasia, our lovely naive college grad who is not only a virgin at 23, but enjoys several hours of sex during her first night of intercourse (yeah...right). And if that isn't enough, she's never had Oysters in her life, even though she lives in Portland, OR. She is the girl in the shadow of the interesting girl, she is the mouse...token..designated driver..whatever. And somehow she manages to gain the attention of Christian Grey who is, in fact, THE MOST INTERESTING AND HOTTEST MAN IN THE WORLD (again, yeah...right).<br /><br />I had to endure 14 chapters of cheesy love-story before I got a hint of what this book supposedly is all about: a sexual relationship build on submission and dominance. Or so I thought! This is a poorly written story of good girl vs. bad man who tries and (perhaps) eventually succeeds in changing this relationship from submission/dominance to \\"happily ever after\\". It belongs on a shelf next to Nicholas Sparks.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games but you have to do them too many times to open a new one.  It should use less points.
B007MLDC2I|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater when it opened. I'm a huge Fincher fan and I was pretty excited about this, as it is right up his alley. I also love crime/serial killer thrillers; Silence of the Lambs and Zodiac are favorites. I have to say he did a fabulous job on his adaptation. The film is distinctly Fincher; dark, ominous, moody, detailed, and long-time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is incredible as usual. Rooney Mara really made this film for me. She was amazing and looked badass. Two things that I didn't care for: the British actors's lack of Swedish accents (took away from the continuity), and the overdrawn bank heist ending.<br /><br />The blu-ray set itself is amazing; the packaging design is cool, there are a massive amount of extra features, and the blu-ray looks amazing in 1080p. I, unlike the ridiculously obnoxious 1-star UV hating Apple fanboy reviewers here, have to give this 5 stars: it's a good film and the blu-ray set itself was a great deal when I bought it on sale. The UV works nicely and not anywhere near the hassle it's made out to be, but UV is a massively insignificant extra feature for me to begin with (and that IS what it IS, an extra. You're buying a blu-ray set) , as I don't make it a habit of watching movies on my laptop over my large screen 1080p HDTV and home thearter system ;)
B007FH9GT2|5.0|It has been years since I've seen a really good susupense movie.  The movie spread out like a spider web only to be reconnected in the end.  Excellent, excellent actors.  Wish I had watched it when it first came out.

1583334386|5.0|I loved this book. I usually don't give out five stars, but The Willpower Instinct earns it easily.<br /><br /> Kelly McDonigal uses up-to-the-minute psychological and neuroscientific information and research studies as the foundation for her book, but the reader is not barraged with overwhelming detail. She has the gift of extracting the most practical, user-friendly, actionable scientific knowledge that the lay person can immediately use to make a difference in one's own life, with whatever \\"willpower challenge\\" that person is facing.<br /><br />If I lived in California, I would enroll in Dr. McDonigal's course at Stanford in a heartbeat! Wish she would take her course on the road as a workshop! Short of that, we have this wonderful book. It can make a difference for anyone facing a \\"willpower challenge,\\" whether related to eating, drinking, sex, substance-abuse, gambling, video games, texting, surfing the net, or staying on Pinterest too long every night. All of us can relate to this book on some level, and be helped by it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a really nice Bible app.  It offers a wide variety of reading plans.  I love the fact that it will read the Bible like an audio book. I subtracted one star because it won't let you use your reading plan or the read aloud option without a wi-fi connection.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|While some individuals are a bit \\"particular\\" on certain aspects of the film, overall, I found it a fun and entertaining movie.  It has action, romance and adventure in it.  Of course it is not going to be like Borne Identity, etc- It's a Disney film.  It does a great job on keeping your attention, overall. I found myself watching more of it again after the initial viewing, and not skipping too much to my favorite parts.  All around, it's a good family film.

B001NFNFF8|5.0|I have just finished watching this movie this morning -Good Friday morning,in Australia.I have never been to the U.S. much less that part of the country,but I had no trouble 'getting into' this movie.After about 20 minutes I was completely hooked and did not stir from my chair until it was finished.I have just been reading the reviews of some of the U.S. viewers,most of whom said that if you have not read any of the books,you will have trouble understanding the film.Well,I have not read any of the books,but had no trouble following the plotlines and characters in the film.<br />Perhaps if these people actually concentrated on what was unfolding on their screens,they would do better.(I have the advantage of living by myself,so when I sit down to watch a movie,I have no distractions;perhaps that is the secret).Your reviewers also made the point that the version released in the U.S. was the shorter,theatrical cut -102 minutes - & not the Director's Cut.Well the Blu-ray release in Australia has both cuts of the film and the version I watched this morning was the longer Director's Cut at 117 mins.I have yet to watch the shorter 102 min.version,which is also on the same Blu-ray released in Australia.(Perhaps your reviewers should import the Australian Blu-ray release).The only complaint I have with the longer version is that it has only a stereo soundtrack whereas the Theatrical Release on the Blu-ray has a 5.1 audio track.As I have a very good 5.1 Surround Sound setup,I was a little disappointed in that,however,it is a good stereo mix.I loved the music as I am a great fan of Delta Blues and Cajun & Zydeco music,so I am now going to look for the CD soundtrack.I loved Levon Helm & Buddy Guy in their roles.I was disappointed to read that there was friction between the Director,Producers  and Tommy Lee Jones;I guess there won't be any more in the series.That is disappointing.  Dennis Moore  AUSTRALIA.The Australian Blu-ray release also has a different cover to your U.S. release with a different photo and Tommy Lee Jones being given top billing.

B002N8A14M|1.0|I bought this product after reading great reviews but was hugely disappointed. First of all mine is an older iPod with bulkier body styling so it doesn't fit in the casing. But that's my fault for not thinking of that before I made the purchase. I use my husbands iPod in it now and still have MULTIPLE problems with it. Here they are: the hole for the circle doesn't line up with the circle on the iPod. The opening on the bottom, which the earbud cable has to fit through doesn't allow the cable in so I have to squeeze it in there. Sometimes it pops out enough to distort the sound. Finally, the top and bottom halves of the case don't clasp tightly enough and sometimes one half flies off with my iPod in it while the other half stays in the armband. As it is I have to clasp the whole unit into the armband upside down to make it remotely functional. don't buy this product.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but it has its glitches. it is ok to get. I hope you have a good time with it.
B001JNNDGA|1.0|A few observations (without spoilers)<br /><br />I finally saw this movie when it was released on home video. I went twice to watch it in theaters and was appalled by the \\"audience\\" awaiting admittance. The first time, I was walking from the parking lot to the box office when a small bus pulled up and a church Sunday school group that included roughly a dozen small children (ages 5 to maybe 8 roughly)hopped out with chaperones. I got in line behind them and listened to the adults talking about the number of times they had each seen the film and how much they were looking forward to discussing it with the children afterwards. Having been previously advised from numerous places of the \\"realism\\" of the torture sequences and crucifixion, I decided the greater \\"horror\\" for me would be in seeing these small children react to the supposedly graphic violence. I simply walked back to my car and went home. The second time (a few weeks later after the initial \\"rush\\" of people going to a new movie had died down a bit)I actually managed to purchase a ticket and was waiting in the lobby for the previous screening to let out. A few minutes later, the doors opened and the crowd began shuffling out. Once again there were several families with small children. While the parents attempted to masquerade their emotional reactions by blinking and talking about how the sudden bright sunlight was \\"tearing\\" them up, the children weren't old enough to be embarrassed about showing feelings in public. Most were openly sobbing, all had red eyes, and one small girl (perhaps 4 or 5 years old at most) was shaking so badly that her dad had to pick her up, console her, and carry her outside. Once again, I was so upset and angry I had to leave.<br /><br />Now that I've seen it with my own eyes I can see why those kids were so freaked out.<br /><br />Although I don't belong to one of the most commonly known denominations, I am a Christian. I am also a daily reader of the scriptures, and have lectured on biblical scripture and prophecy all over the Eastern U.S. in churches and seminaries, as well as on college campuses. In other words, while I wouldn't define myself as an expert on all things God, I'm a bit more spiritually \\"seasoned\\" than most laypeople.<br /><br />The life of Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Bible, is centered around the final 3 years of his earthly life. His birth is depicted - especially in regards to the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and Jewish traditions - and there is a brief mention of his youth in the book of Luke. There are literally dozens of events during the 3 years of Christ's earthly mission that are filmworthy. In fact, the sheer number of films made about his life stand as proof of that fact. Did the world truly need a story that not only focuses primarily on Jesus' final week, but uses every means of modern effects to splatter gore and depict the massive agony endured by the Son of God? Maybe I'm in the minority (apparently, I should say) but I don't need to watch Jesus writhe and scream with each strike of the lash in order to respect and understand the sacrifice such suffering represented. I didn't need to personally witness the nails being driven in, the biblical depiction sufficed. The Glory of Christ's sacrifice is not found in his willingness to endure pain and death in God's name. Literally hundreds of millions of ordinary people have done that before Christ's birth as well as after. The Glory of Christ is found in the Word of God that came from his lips and the power of the Holy Spirit that transformed the entirety of humankind.<br />We are asked to live the message and believe in Christ's name. We are not required to bear witness to the atrocities committed to his human vessel.<br /><br />But most important of all, I deeply believe that forcing or allowing small children to endure the trauma of watching the torture and murder of someone they have been taught to love above all others is not only unnecessary,but borders on abuse. Learning of the Passion from the Bible or from suitable talks with parents, clergy, and Sunday school teachers should be enough education for a small child to understand that God loves them and that Jesus can live within their hearts.<br /><br />Mel Gibson may have had the best intentions (my right to judge ends at the tip of my own nose) but I am of the opinion that the end result represents a massive and grotesque misjudgement.<br /><br />Feel free to slam this review if that is your wont. But please take a moment to consider whether this film is age appropriate to your own children as well.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.but borders on abuse.

This is the _only_ DVD I have that seems to be a problem. I'm going to remember \\"FOX\\" the next time I buy a DVD; they may be protecting the content-rights management, but this heavy-handed don't-trust-the-consumer approach just drives me away.<br /><br />Googling turned up many DRM issues with various setups; the responsibility for this belongs to FOX.

B005691VNK|4.0|I bought this flash to go with a newly acquired Fuji X-S1. The reason for both purchases, I got tired of lugging around a full backpack of equipment. I bought the flash because the on camera flash seems to be like all on camera flashes, it has a tendency to flatten and be a bit harsh, with this flash I use the bounce feature and also flip the diffusion shade down, this method has worked well. The weight is minimal, that was my number 1 priority, its also very compact. It meets my requirements and I would buy it again.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was the first biography I've ever read, and I'm really satisfied for putting in the time to read it. This book is really great at describing the life, accomplishments, feelings and personality of the genius who was capable of changing the world with his ideas and products.<br />The book starts even before Steve was born, and ends in an agonizing battle against cancer, and provides many details about what happened in between. It describes his early relationship with his parents, how he met Wozniak and started Apple with him, his journey in India, the intensity of the work done to create the Macintosh, his roles at both Next and Pixar, his return to Apple, the release of the iPod, iPhone, iPad, iCloud, and his struggles with the disease that ended up taking his life.<br />Maybe like all Apple products, this book is fantastic, but has a few flaws, which are not enough to diminish the brilliance of the product. Such flaws, in my opinion, are the somewhat low level of details about the creation of the iPhone and the iPad. The creation of the Macintosh feels like a true quest in search of perfection and making it \\"Insanely Great\\" and you really get what it was like both for him and his team to work so hard to ship such an amazing product. But for the iPhone and the iPad, it felt like the author was either unwilling, or not able to write the story in such a detailed way. But none of this takes away the joy of reading the book.<br />Reading it makes you feel a mix of emotions as you go though the descriptions of what he did to make the best products he could, the way he could be brutal to who he considered bozos, what other people thought of him, and some of his intimate thoughts and feelings. It does get really emotional at some parts, for example when he reads a letter to his wife on the celebration of their 20th marriage anniversary, at Bill Gates last visit to his house, when he released the Macintosh and a few others.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wantsto know more about his life, his work, and how he was able to do the things he did. It really teaches you some lessons about how you should face challenges and make important decisions in life.
B0073XORCY|3.0|Ian Anderson says in the liner notes of Thick As A Brick 2 that this is a progressive rock concept album. While it can be described as a concept album since all the songs are about the fictional child prodigy Gerald Bostock, this is in no stretch of the imagination a progressive rock album.<br /><br />While Thick As A Brick is one continuous song with multiple and recurring musical themes, Thick As A Brick 2 is composed of 17 stand alone songs, and even though its curious that this was released as an Ian Anderson solo album, whereas the original in 1972 was a Tull album, I  can certainly see why this is so. This new effort includes nobody from the Tull lineup (except Anderson), and the sound is much more like an Ian Anderson solo album then a Jethro Tull album, albeit with a few snippets here and there from the original Thick As A Brick thrown in.<br /><br />Also of interest is the fact that Thick As A Brick was \\"credited\\" to the fictional Gerald Bostock, while Thick As A Brick 2 is \\"about\\" Gerald Bostock.<br /><br />I can say that this is an ok disc, but its more straight up acoustic rock music, with the occasional electric guitar thrown in here and there, than a true tribute to the original.

0871404133|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00INB9DEC An Executive Summary of Edward O. Wilson's 'The Social Conquest of Earth']]<br /><br />The main argument: Since the dawn of self-awareness we human beings have struggled to understand ourselves. This struggle has found form in religion, philosophy, art and, most recently, science. The most pivotal turning point in science's quest to understand humanity came with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection in the mid 19th century. While the application of this theory to understand human behaviour has taken time (and engendered a great deal of controversy), enough progress has now been made to outline the story in full, and to fill in several of the details. It is just this task that legendary biologist E.O. Wilson takes up in his new book `The Social Conquest of Earth'.<br /><br />For Wilson, understanding humanity must begin with an understanding of how we came to be the ultrasocial species that we are. Drawing upon evidence from other eusocial species (such as bees, wasps, termites and ants--the latter of which Wilson has spent much of his career studying), as well as numerous sciences focused in on humanity and its past, Wilson recreates this story. According to the author, the story reaches its first major turning point when our ancestors began establishing home-bases at which they raised their young, and near which they foraged and scavenged for food. This development itself was largely a result of a genetic modification that led our ancestors to rely more and more on meat in their diet (and was greatly spurred on by, if not entirely dependent upon, the ability to control fire, which fire was used to establish more lasting campsites).<br /><br />Once human beings had established nests, environmental pressures began selecting for traits that increasingly drew group members into cooperative relationships with one another (which cooperation was beneficial in such enterprises as hunting expeditions). This added cooperation not only contributed to the extent to which these early humans could reap resources from the environment, but also helped them in competition with other groups--especially in warfare. The benefits of cooperation and cohesion in allowing groups to out-compete other groups eventually allowed group-level selection to add a layer of tribalist sentiment to the members of our species (which tribalist sentiment draws from us a deep attachment to our in-groups, and a corresponding mistrust and contempt for members of out-groups). This tribalist sentiment eventually set the stage for the development of the first religions. The cooperative and tribalist sentiments that evolved during this time ultimately explains why our psyches are torn between selflessness and selfishness, virtue and vice. (On the topic of group-level selection, it turns out that this theory has been out of favour in the scientific community for over 40 years, and a big part of Wilson's purpose here is to resurrect the theory, and reestablish its credibility.)<br /><br />Backing up in our story just a bit, for our in-group cooperation to occur, added mental equipment was needed (and evolved) that allowed humans to understand each others' intentions and work together to achieve goals. This added mental ability drew upon earlier increases in brain capacity that our ancestors had used first for life in the trees, and later for life on the ground, to fashion rudimentary tools. Eventually, the added mental capacity evolved into the ability to understand abstraction, and to use arbitrary symbols for communication, thus leading to the evolution of language.<br /><br />Once the capacity for abstraction and language were established, the capacity for culture exploded and our ancestors were set on the fast track that led to our current way of life. Specifically, the onset of language led to the development of religion, art and music, and all of the other trappings of culture thatwe know and enjoy today. Wilson takes us through each of them one by one, and the process of gene-culture co-evolution that acted upon them, in order to help us understand how this process unfolded. Later, the explosion of culture led to technology that eventually gave rise to agriculture, and then to the rise of chiefdoms, and finally states and the first true civilizations.<br /><br />Wilson's work is well geared to a general audience and he very rarely goes outside of what might reasonably be expected from such an audience. On the rare occasions when he does, he is sure to follow this up with a simplified summary of his line of thought. Also, Wilson occasionally strays outside of his story to moralize and (at the end) prognosticate on the future, and at times these efforts seem awkward and out of place. Again, though, these forays are few and far between, and many will no doubt enjoy them. A full summary of the book is available here: [[ASIN:B00INB9DEC An Executive Summary of Edward O.

0545265355|5.0|I ordered them and came within in a week with free shipping. My sister then proceeded to reading them before I had a chance to. Normally she never reads much but she is currently half way through the second book after 4 days. I have now started reading the first book and it is very well written. I enjoy it even though I am older. The easiness of the read and the great story line can be enjoyed by all.

0143119680|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of all types of interesting facts about history, alchemy, books, food, wine, medieval architecture, etc. If what you want is a book without anything except action...do not get this book. On the other hand if you like good literature, interesting and sympathetic characters, a good plot, weird bits of factual information and a leisurely romp through history... buy it now!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the books that should be studied in school. This is not another Twilight series, far from it. It may only appear this way if you are completely blind to all the artistic devices the author uses to make you reflect and think about what this is book is REALLY about. I saw a review by an expert on the author's website that captures exactly how I felt:<br />\\"I was so obsessed with this book I had to take it with me out to dinner and hide it under the edge of the table so I wouldn't have to stop reading. The story kept me up for several nights in a row, because even after I was finished, I just lay in bed wide awake thinking about it...The Hunger Games is amazing.\\" I just got done reading the last novel - literally 5 minutes ago, and the characters Suzanne Collins created are so alive and real in my head, I will be thinking of them for a long-long time. I am 28, not an impressionable teenager, but I saw The Hunger Games movie and was intrigued and craving to know what's next. I read the trilogy in under a week and the only thing that I regret is that I will not hear more about Katniss and Peeta's life in the new world. Read it, think about it, it is very real.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I ordered The Hunger Games so I could read the book before I saw the movie.  Once I got into the book I could not put it down.  Can't wait to get the 2nd book!  This is a quick read, and easy to follow if you do put it down.

0312576463|5.0|This story is a Rohrschach test for your deepest emotional responses.  I guess that's why some people love it while others are repelled by it.  For me, the book was fun fun fun, then WTF, followed by a rich tapestry of emotions and spiritual embroidery that left me grateful for human yearnings for love and peace.  Simply put, the books opens like a hair dresser who won't shut up, and you don't what him too.  Dish Dish Dish, girlfriend!!  You long for a manicure and wild laughter with \\"No you didn't\\" rejoiners and deep schadenfruede satisfaction.  Then the trail curves to something like Chekhov's Uncle Vanya.  You see the antique drawing room with maps of environmental doom, connecting the past with the predicted present:  a tragedy of nature's loss and human ambivalence.  Meanwhile, all the doubts of human endeavor and dispair lead our characters to moral decay that causes all the pain that modern media celebrate.  But love and desire prevail.  Spritual and emotional growth succeed.  Regret turns to hope.  Any person old enough to experience the vast varieties of twists and turns of life will find the plot realistic, fascinating, and satisfying.  The characters are realistic, people I have known.  People I grew to root for.  Jane Austin in their subtlety.  What more can you hope for....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just a mile a minute plot with an infusion of knowledge in law, our court system, and psychology and sociology.  It was ingeniously intertwined in every way with plots within a plot, wonderful foreshadowing, clues all over the place, and surprise after surprise.  Can hardly wait to read another William Landay.
B004HV54TU|5.0|We ordered this for a staff member who was experiencing several different ergonomic issues, including protracted and increasing levels of hand, wrist, and arm pain. We first tried several different mice, including an assortment of trackballs, none of which seemed to make a difference. She then switched to left-handed mousing but that was not very successful either.<br /><br />After reading the reviews, I placed this order for her, purchasing the small version since she is a petite person. After using it for only a few days, she reports that there is GREAT improvement in her comfort level and that this has really made a difference. Therefore - we would highly recommend trying this item if you are experiencing hand, wrist, arm issues from repetitive / prolonged use

It's definitely a little dark (what with serial killers isn't), but the writing and acting is superb. A writing team that can make you root for a killer is a good writing team. The characters in this show are stellar, from the train wreck of a sister, to the sweet girlfriend, and the quirky cops. I love everything about this show. If you aren't too squeamish - it's a must see. Thanks Showtime!

B0009SQ610|5.0|Once is one of Nightwish's most dark and mysterious albums I've listened to for long time. This album contains much meanings beneath meanings, for us to find out what the actual picture is about this album. I believe their pianist had undergone much depression, sadness, and sorrow related conflicts which enabled him to write such a inscrutable album.
B002BWQ586|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of the zombie genre. Despite the fact that the undead have been a little oversaturated in popular culture right now, I still dig most of the stuff that comes out. I liked season one of the Walking Dead (haven't watched season two yet), I love the Romero movies, Shaun of the Dead, and on and on.<br /><br />With all that being said, I started reading World War Z with high expectations. The author of this book, Max Brooks, is also well known for writing \\"The Zombie Survival Guide.\\" Essentially what you get is a post-apocalyptic society that is just starting to function efficiently again after the zombie plague. The story is told through a series of interviews of survivors throughout the country.<br /><br />The beginning and ending are an exciting mix of storytelling and drama. The middle parts are hit or miss for me. Some of the stories from various countries around the world are just plain boring. They serve their purpose, but it makes the over 300 page book feel like a much longer read than it should be. Aside from the slow points, most of the stories give you a perspective that no other zombie tale has ever gotten into.<br /><br />How would the government react to such an outbreak over time? How would the public react? How would an army combat a zombie hoard? What's the most efficient way to take out a zombie? There are so many little things beyond these simple concepts that are explored. For example, people are essentially dropping zombies off in the middle of large bodies of water...only to have them become a bigger problem than they were in the first place. That's just one quick example of some the things that aren't explored enough in some of these stories from the movies most of us have seen. This book goes into a lot of detail about the things that you wouldn't even think of.<br /><br />Much like most books that involve the government, Max Brooks does push his own agenda with his opinions about isolationism and the government's inability to do anything without delay. There's an obvious mistrust of government that comes through in this book, but it does nothing to hurt the read. Most of it is done very realistically and not in a ridiculous, conspiracy theory style light.<br /><br />I liked the book. I'm looking forward to the movie that is apparently starring Brad Pitt. I wish they would have used the same concept as the book, but I guess they're going in a different direction. After a day to think about it, I'm giving this book a 3 machete rating. If the whole book could have kept pace with the high points it would have been a 4 machete rating. Unfortunately, the slow points are VERY slow and it drags the book down. I'll have to check out The Zombie Survival Guide when I get a chance. Give this one a read and try to rush through some of the slow parts so you don't lose focus on the better parts of the book.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King since I first started reading his short stories in the 1970's.  His ability to take a simple, mundane event, like going for a swim at the local watering hole, and turn it into a deadly, heart stopping horrific event has always awed me.  I have always looked forward to the next book; the new twists I didn't see coming.  I hesitated to buy this book because I long ago gave up on the idea a plausible time travel story could be written.  Yes, I know horror, fantasy and science fiction stories require the reader to suspend disbelief, but time travel stories lend themselves to a particularly nasty conundrum.  Still, if anyone could fill the holes, it would be King himself.  Sadly, but not altogether unexpectedly, King brings nothing especially new to the genre.  The flaws in time travel are just too great.  I wouldn't say the book fails as a story of time travel; it succeeds as well as any could.  That just isn't enough.<br /><br />The story itself, without the time travel aspect, is a fascinating read.  King has done his research and has recreated the late 50's and early 60's with skill.  King works with a large cast of characters, and as in the past, I felt like I knew enough about each of them, even the minor ones, to understand and care about them.  It gets trickier with historical figures, but King even here manages to give them depth.  Oswald, of whom much has been written over the years, but little is really known, could easily have become a caricature, but King avoids this.  Yes, he's dark and disturbed, but we also get to see his passion and frustration.  In other words, he's not so different from the rest of us.  King's research into the events leading up to the assassination of Kennedy is impeccable, and using the little known, but factual, attack on General Walker as a major plot device is inspired.  So to is the description of life in the time period.  King is unsparing in his assessment of mid twentieth century America, andmanages to show that, while the era of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" did exist, so to it was a time when neighbors turned a blind eye to the bruises on the housewife across the street.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, besides the failings of any time travel story, it is in some of the descriptions of Texas, and its nitpicking, really.  I was raised there, and was a young child during that era.  The description of Dallas ring true.  The description of a small town rings true, particularly the devotion to football.  But Texas is a vast, large state, and though it conjures well for the reader, Midland is too far away from Dallas for the people of Dallas back then to even know it was there, let alone be able to smell it.  Like I said, nitpicking.  Fans of King will like this book, just don't read it hoping for a new twist to the time travel story.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I have never heard of JoJo Moyes, and the book title would not have drawn me in. But Amazon recommended it (following other books I have read), and on reading all the 5 star reviews, I thought I would give it a try. I absolutely loved it! Like a really good movie, it made me cry. The way it is written is amazing - wonderful! I am now about to download another JoJo Moyes book, and certainly looking forward to the new one being released in September this year.
0439023491|3.0|The second in the book series is good. It really shines when it focuses on friendship, family, uprising and the all star tributes. Katniss,her mom,Prim,Gale,Hazelle and Haymitch are all so rootable. President Snow is a really great villain.<br /><br />What is not so wonderful is the times strong,smart and rootable Katniss is a pawn in everyone's elses plans and not a part of the planning. She is not the hero but a pawn. That part brings the book down as does the overly dramatic forced romance. Teen character books would do much better if they got over the clique romance and especially overly done triangles. Katniss and this series does better when it is not focused on romance but on family love, friendship love and empowering the districts. Triangles especially this one I hate. I am so annoyed with triangles in books and movies especially the teen ones. They are predictable.I can clearly see that she'll end up with Peeta if they live. It is uninspired or original. In triangles one you usually hate, one you pity or root for and the one in the middle gets annoying. Plus the girl always choices the one heavily feature in first book or film and like Twilight's Jacob, Vampire Academy's Adrian or Mason, Ducky from Pretty in Pink,etc the best friend does not get the girl. Peeta is overly cheesy in his professions of love. It becomes pathetic. The highlight in the book is the rebellion.
