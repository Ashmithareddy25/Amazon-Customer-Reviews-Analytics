B000002UD0|4.0|If you were to buy three of the best John Lennon solo albums, Walls & Bridges would be one of those albums (the other being the Plastic Ono Band and Imagine). We find Lennon in an introspective mindset reflecting on his life at the time, including his \\"lost year\\" with Harry Nilsson. The production is full, his vocals are great and the songs are all solid. BnB Beatles Depot

1595141715|5.0|Fabulous book.  I hope this becomes required reading in high schools instead of that boring stuff.  This is story of a boy who listens to and audio tape of a girl who has committed suicide.  The tapes are essentially a suicide note of a character who is already gone but who was written so well that the reader will root for her despite knowing the inevitable.  The boy listening to the tapes also gives the reader a different point of view to the events described by the girl.  There are many messages that can be interpreted from this book and many will find themselves contemplating them well after the book is done.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix consists of nine animated shorts that revolve around the Wachowski Brothers' trilogy of The Matrix films.  Seven of the nine shorts are considered to be anime; \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" and \\"Metriculated\\" are the two shorts that are not considered to be anime.  Madhouse, one of the major animation studios in Japan, was involved with almost all seven of the anime shorts.  The names involved with the seven anime shorts are Mahiro Maeda, Shinichiro Watanabe, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, and Koji Morimoto.<br /><br />While all seven of these stories are done in an anime style, the animation style is different for each story (with the only exception being the two parts of \\"The Second Renaissance,\\" which have the same animation style).  Each director brought their own style to the short they were working on.  While most of these shorts are not inter-related, you can still tell that they are part of the same whole unit of The Animatrix.<br /><br />The DVD release includes some bonus features.  There are audio commentaries for \\"The Second Renaissance Part I,\\" \\"The Second Renaissance Part II,\\" \\"Program,\\" and \\"World Record.\\"  There are subtitles provided, because the audio for the commentaries is in Japanese.  There is a 22-minute documentary titled, \\"Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime.\\"<br /><br />There are text-only biographies for the directors and the segment producers involved with The Animatrix.  There are also \\"making of\\" mini-features for the various shorts, and each mini-feature runs for roughly seven minutes.  There is also a DVD-ROM link.<br /><br />I would recommend The Animatrix to anyone over the age of eighteen, due to the violence included in the shorts.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to a fan of The Matrix films, so they can acquire some backstory for the films, as well as see some additional stories for The Matrix universe.
0451529065|5.0|You know what's an even more interesting fiction? The Bible. I look at reviews to know about the quality of the product, not the ignorance of people. Please don't come here and give a bad review to this well-crafted presentation of a great book because you're so insecure, you call evolution a fictionalized story. I find it hilarious that people who point out the \\"lack of evidence\\" for evolution are always Christians who believe the Bible is the word of God! Wow.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has never seen a Rush show or has, and would like to relive it. I went to this concert twice this year and sat in the 3rd row right in front of Alex for the last one. I can tell you that this Blu Ray disc captures the concert experience totally. The list of songs is fantastic. The sound and picture quality are like nothing I have experienced on my tv before. I have a Sony Bravia 46 inch 1080i TV.....As if the music wasnt enough, this is worth getting for the hilarious outtakes alone! Any and every Rush fan wont be disappointed. And those of you trying out Rush for the first time also wont be disappointed. So celebrate the best Canada has to offer in the music field while we can still enjoy them. Rush might not be the same as they were in the 70's and 80's, they might actually be better now....And that is what makes Rush one of the greatest bands in the history of rock.
0956010903|1.0|I am very disappointed in it. I wish I had seen someone's first to know I did not want it.<br /><br />The outer book is a very large plastic thing. Did not need to be half that size.<br /><br />The little book inside is OK, but hard to open and not easy to read.<br /><br />The art prints that go with it are extremely poor. They were done by J K Rowling, but just because she can write does not mean she can draw. She hasn't the faintest knowledge of anatomy. They are just bad.<br /><br />I would not recommend this purchase to anyone.  After coming to appreciate the value and the quality of her past books, I feel I was tricked into the purchase of this one.
0765316897|5.0|It's hard for me to put into words exactly how blown away by this book, this series, and Brandon Sanderson's writing in general I am. Each book in this series scales up the epic factor of the difficulties the characters must face, and yet it happens in a logical progression. I was surprised often by twists in the story - and believe me, that doesn't happen much.     Some readers have complained about the ending, either that it was too depressing or that it was too happy. I think that Sanderson managed to strike a perfect balance between the two, leaving an absolutely fulfilling ending that has its sober moments but has chords of hope being struck as well.     And it is utterly, utterly epic.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while \\"inside\\" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note:  the creation of the special effects; interviews/commentary, mostly with Stan Lee, of the evolution of the comic book series; and a fun glimpse into Downey Jr's and Bridge's rehearsal of one scene.  Blu-Ray also includes BD Live, if you're into that kind of online chat.  (I don't have the regular DVD, but I assume that the two-disk version has the same extras, minus BD Live.)<br /><br />This was a fun, action-packed, and at times humorous superhero film. Unlike some blockbusters, this film uses special effects to supplement the acting and the action, not the other way around.  I enjoyed every minute of it.-packed, and at times humorous superhero film.

0375826726|3.0|For the guy's age, I think he's done an enviable job.  However, there are some things to learn.<br /><br />Paolini just has not developed the chops yet to not telegraph his surprises.  The surprises are not really surprises.  Also, and I noticed this in Elder too, he does not yet have the skill to intertwine his chapters to keep multiple threads going in tandem.  There will be several chapters with one set of characters, until it gets to the point of being overdue to switch back to the other threads.<br /><br />Eragon's real father was divulged in this book.  It wasn't a big dramatic plot turn though.  It was sort of ho hum.<br /><br />As far as telegraphing surprises, I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that Angela, the herbalist, is actually Selena, Eragon's mother, undercover from Galbatorix, and watching over her son.  I could be wrong, but I don't remember Eragon's real father meeting up with Angela in the previous books, so there was no big reason to divulge this at the time.  And, from what I remember, no one seems to have seen Selena die.  Am I wrong?<br /><br />The book was an ok read.  It didn't feel so derivative this time around.  There were a couple of things that felt original, but I can't remember what they are now.
B000021Y77|5.0|This heart-pumping, frantic, postmodern German film models itself after a video game, where different choices lead down different paths, to different conclusions, all within the control of the player.  And yet, this film is so much more than that.<br /><br />Franka Potente plays clown-haired Lola, a young woman in love with bumbling Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) and who finds herself racing against the clock to scrounge up the vast sum of 100,000 marks to save Manni's life.  As she runs through Berlin, she bumps into various people, whose fates are shown in flashes of slideshows, who may help or hinder her.  The soundtrack is thumping, almost minimalist, with a voice droning over Lola's high-stakes sprint, and it keeps the viewer as breathless as Lola herself.<br /><br />Because this film messes with the viewer's mind, the plot cannot be fully described without revealing spoilers.  Suffice it to say that viewers will have their expectations changed at every step.  The production standards are not Hollywood-slick, but director Twyker adeptly portrays both the desperate and the sweet in this story, with brilliant cinematography that takes this film to a high level.  As the depth of Lola's and Manni's relationship is revealed, the character form the heart of this surprising, thought-provoking film.<br /><br />Watch this more than once.  You'll love it.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|As my first introduction to Dream Theater I have to say I was pretty pissed after I bought this cd. I bought it on the strengh of Ministry of lost souls which is why I gave the cd 2 stars and not 1. I finally realise why I hate Prog Rock (with the exception of anything John Oliva does) It is so over blown over polished all of its soul has been ripped out. Were is the rawness this stuff is so sanitised who in this band has such a fragile ego that they dare not leave any sparkle left in this music they have to make sure every lick is perfect every chord played to a T every drum hit just exactly right uhg!   The singer is good I do like him and have heard he has done some solo stuff maybe that will be better
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|A mind blowing movie... This was actually the first of the 'modern' Batman movies that I'd seen. The performances where amazing all around. It almost felt like several movies in one, the story just kept going without ever getting boring. Action packed, creative...awesome.
1591396190|5.0|W. Chan Kim is Professor of Strategy and International Management at INSEAD. Renée Mauborgne is The INSEAD Distinguished Fellow and a Professor of Strategy and Management. This book was published in 2005 and consists of three parts, whereby each part consists of 2-to-5 chapters each. There is also a short preface and 3 proper appendices.    The aim of the book is made clear in the preface: to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known market space. Whereby the authors in the first chapter introduce blue ocean strategy: \\"... blue ocean strategy challenges companies to create uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant ... blue ocean strategy is about growing demand and breaking away from the competition.\\" The successful formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy is based on six principles which are discussed in chapter 3 through to 8. However, Chapter 2 first introduces the analytical tools and frameworks that are essential for creating and capturing blue oceans.    The 4 chapters in Part II - Formulating Blue Ocean Strategy introduce the four guiding principles for the successful formulation of blue ocean strategy. Chapter 3 identifies the paths by which you can systematically create uncontested market space across diverse industry domains, hence attenuating `search risk'. The authors introduce the `six paths framework' which have general applicability across industry sectors for remaking market boundaries. In the fourth chapter, the authors recommend companies to redesign their traditional strategic planning process and focus on the big picture, via the strategy canvas, to create value innovation and thereby tackling `planning risk'. The authors minimize `scale risk' in Chapter 5 by challenging conventional practice of aiming for finer segmentation to better meet existing customer preferences and create the greatest market of new demand. Chapter 6 addresses`business model risk' by ensuring that a company builds a viable business model to product and maintain profitable growth through a strategy sequence of utility, price, cost, and adoption.    In Part III - Executing Blue Ocean Strategy the authors turn to the principles that drive effective execution of blue ocean strategy. Specifically, Chapter 7 deals with organizational risk and introduces `tipping point leadership', which managers can use to mobilize an organization the key organizational hurdles that block the implementation of a blue ocean strategy. Chapter 8 argues for the integration of execution into strategy making and deals with `management risk' associated with people's attitudes and behaviors. The final chapter discusses the dynamic aspects of blue ocean strategy - the issues of sustainability and renewal. \\"Creating blue oceans is not a static achievement but a dynamic process.\\" In addition, there are 3 proper appendices to assist in the explanation of blue ocean strategy.    Yes, I do like this book. I see this book as a complement in the field of strategy to Michael E. Porter's landmark book \\"Competitive Strategy\\". The authors focus on the creation of blue oceans, which is about growing (new) demand and breaking away from the traditional face-to-face competition that can be seen in red oceans. Blue ocean strategy is based on 4 formulation and 2 execution principles that address both opportunity and risk. Just keep in mind that creation of blue oceans will take time, requires determination to sustain and continuously renew the chosen strategy.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|It was during the summer of 2000, roughly a year before 9/11 that i was a tourist at the world trade centre and went to the top and could see the sheer magnificence of man's creativity and sense of urban architecture at its finest moment. I also suffer from a mild fear of heights, so when we went on the top, i was almost gripping the railing (even though its on a separate protective structure) for dear life, but after awhile once my senses adjusted to the height. I was blown apart by the view and the whole largesse of the situation. but i digress..<br /><br />It is without a doubt an act of sheer lunacy that a person would actually have the gall to tightrope walk across the towers, from my memory of my tour up there, the very notion is mind boggling to say the least.<br /><br />The documentary itself is a carefully and efficiently prepared sequence of re-enactments and collages of photos with certain video footage pertaining to network and news archives of those covering the story at that time. I have to admit, watching the documentary alone, i started feeling a bit dizzy :)<br /><br />Its an amazing documentary that details how Phillipe meticulously planned the whole operation and his thoughts on the same on why it had to be done. He comes across as a person with such a passion and desire for life, love and happiness that its an inspiration just to see this documentary and how his totally insane act will change you and encourage you to go and truly live life.<br /><br />Thank you Monsieur Petit, it was a great show, which would have been something else to actually see live.<br /><br />10 Star rating, a keeper in my collection.
B001GRTPKM|5.0|The Police: Certifiable is simply a fantastic live concert video.  The video shows why this was one of the greatest bands....many songs make you wonder how only 3 guys can make the amazing sounds you hear.  Fantastic footage and sound together with a performance that make you feel the energy of a great Police concert.  Andy Summers delivers astounding guitar parts with ease, leaving you to think he is one of the true guitar virtuosos.  Sting sings with ease and plays a confident bass while Copeland shows his own signature style and flair in each jam and new arrangement.  A must for Police fans and sure to win over casual listeners.  Get it on Blu-Ray if you can.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this soundtrack. I know that a lot of people have very strong feelings about the selected track list, but let me explain why I have listened to this album every day since I got it two weeks ago.<br /><br />1) Robert Pattinson's songs are great. Yes, he mumbles. But let us remember the number of great musicians who are also mumblers ... Bob Dylan. Not that I'm comparing the two musicians, because I'm not. All I'm saying is that disliking a song because you think the artist mumbles is ridiculous.<br /><br />2) For everyone who is complaining about the Perry Ferrell song ... it's the song that is playing at the prom in the movie. No, it's not my favorite song on the album, but I can appreciate it.<br /><br />3) This soundtrack has introduced me to new music ... and I cannot fault anything that can do that. Blue Foundation is a fantastic band that I wouldn't have discovered had it not been for the disc. And although I have other Iron and Wine albums, I was not familar with this track.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great soundtrack. Yes, I have read the books and yes Bella's Lullaby was not what I expected. However, I really like the piece. And the inclusion of the other classical pieces is great!
031606792X|2.0|This book turned out to be disapointing for me. In the three books before, I could really relate to Bella, she was clumsy, made mistakes, sometimes reckless, and I could understand her thought process. In Breaking Dawn, I feel like she loses all of that. She turned into this flat character. I also didn't care much for the one-big-happy-family ending. A little more conflict and sacrifice would have made for a better read for me.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Again........as with the other blu-ray movies I've reviewed:  excellent video and sound, way beyond what a standard DVD has to offer.  Lots of action, exploding sound effects, wonderful plot, characters, etc.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|There was a moment, right before settling in to watch The Dark Knight, where I felt dread that it could not possibly live up to it's hype.  I was intrigued when it started and was totally absorbed into it in less than 5 minutes.  I never looked back.  This movie clicked from beginning to end and never lets you go.  It builds on what made Batman Begins so great and totally meets all expectations.  The Dark Knight has a strong theme that runs through the whole movie about what it takes to make someone do the evil that we do.  Every character is faced with darkness and how they deal with it.  The choices we make do have consequences.  The only fault I have with The Dark Knight is the Harvey Dent story.  It was integral to the story, but I do not like how it was resolved.  I guess in the grand scale of the story, it makes sense, but the character was basically dismissed once that plot point was over.  Overall, as many have said, this movie was all about The Joker.  Heath Ledger made this movie special and proves why The Joker is Batman's best villian.
B0018RWD6S|5.0|This cd stands up to all the superlatives.  It is timeless, sweet and grand.
B0014TK7JK|5.0|This set contains the best versions of the film available. In 1995 Lucasfilms remastered the color and put some sharper filters on the picture as a marketing ploy to prepare the release of the horrible edited versions released in 1997. This 1995 set has NO ADDED CG, NO REVISIONS OR EXTRA FOOTAGE. This set was how it was supposed to be. Its wonderful. The only problem is, it was only released on VHS so I suggest purchasing these and transfering them to DVD before the tape quality starts to break down. Its also not widescreen but I'll live with that. Its better than seeing Hayden Christansen edited into the final scene of Return of the Jedi with the Yanni-style music edited into the background...
B001H5X7KC|4.0|The quality of the film in Blu ray is amazing.  The action seems more real and intensive especially when you see all the detail.  In high definition, you can see the moss on the mountain side while the actors are flying in the helicopter, and the audio is amazing with all the bass and clarity.  Definitely if you can, get the movie in Blu -Ray, it's worth it.  A ton of special features and BD live incorporated make this the obvious choice.
185984054X|3.0|The portrait or montage presented to the reader appears to have been based on \\"reverse engineering\\" of the facts to support a preconceived conclusion.  I agree with the saying, \\"Let the truth be told and the truth will make you free.\\"  Furthermore, sometimes it is better to make an observation with a wink and a nod rather than a snarl and a shout.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Dark Knight is one awesome film, and the transfer to Blu ray is quite amazing.  The audio is superb, and the Joker's theme sounds very eerie hearing it in  surround sound.  Blu ray audio on the pS3 with a Denon soundbar makes it sound just amazing.      The film looks fantastic, with some graininess.  I guess the film was shot in digital so the graininess is standard fare (that's just my guess).  You can see all the detail on the suits, and everything just looks lifelike on screen.  This is not the best movie to display the true capabilities of HD because the film is dark, but for audiophiles, you need to hear this one.     A ton of specials, BD live, plus digital copy to transfer onto your iPod makes this a great buy.  Definitely check out Hans Zimmer special on the disc to hear how he created the Joker's theme.  It's brilliant!
B001C46P2A|4.0|The story opens in 1939, in northern Australia, as Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) arrives from England to sell her huge cattle ranch.  The neighboring cattle baron has killed her husband and scared off all of her workers except for one drover (Hugh Jackman) with whom she locks horns immediately.  Sarah also meets Nullah, a half-white/half-aborigine orphan who is afraid of being captured by the police.<br /><br />The movie tries hard to be an \\"epic\\" and certainly is sprawling in scope, especially in the big cattle-driving scenes.  (Unfortunately, the CGI cattle were obvious and made it feel somewhat like a cartoon.)  I really couldn't understand the Aussie accents, so I was a bit hampered on the fine points of the story.  And the movie couldn't decide if it was a western, a love story, a fish-out-of-water comedy, a war story, or a protest movie about the treatment of aboriginal people.  It covered all these plots, was way too long, and felt a bit choppy, but still I sobbed through the last half hour.<br /><br />Kidman starts out as a silly nitwit but develops some personality and depth in the second half of the movie.  Jackman is well-cast as the rugged and nameless drover, but the real star of the show is Brandon Walters who plays the half-caste Nullah.  He's a natural actor, always believable, and very charismatic.<br /><br />Overall, it's an OK movie; it tries to do too much but is well-made.  3.5 stars.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|First and foremost, PLEASE do not let this review or the rating of this product reflect on the film itself.         Let me start by saying that I love this film, never before have I been so \\"wowed\\" by a film as I was when I saw this at the midnight showing on opening night. The Dark Knight is phenomenal and it deserves more than a five star rating. Christopher Nolan is due a world of credit for the creative and ingenious filmmaking that goes into this movie and it goes without saying that the flawless acting, especially from the late Heath Ledger, elevates the film to a greater level. The film is wonderful and engaging and it utilizes a perfect balance between explosive action sequences and intelligent dialogue. The movie hits on all cylinders and is gripping all the way through to the credits, at which point you find yourself wishing the movie wasn't over.           I was so excited for the release of the DVD that I had to Pre-Order one just to ensure I had it in my hands the day it came out. I immediately watched through the Blu-Ray version and I was just as impressed as I was when I first saw the film. I was stunned by how unbelievable the quality of the Blu-Ray picture and sound were and the scenes filmed in IMAX were smoothly integrated throughout the film.            I was thrilled to see that the Blu-Ray DVD came with a second disk packed with special features and a third digital disk to use on your computer. Unfortunately, disappointment struck as soon as I began exploring the \\"Special Features\\". I have never been so aghast at the lack of effort and preparations put into \\"Bonus\\" features, if you could even call anything on the second disk a bonus. The Special Features lack an actual \\"The Making Of\\" and there are no Out-takes, no Deleted Scenes and there is absolutely zero look into Ledger's preparation for his transformation into the Joker. It's understandable that content surrounding Ledger may have been removed due to the tragic circumstances of his death,however it's astonishing that an inside look at any of the leading cast members is nonexistent. I think I speak for a great deal of people when I say I eagerly awaited, for a long time, to see this DVD and perhaps receive some meager glimpse of an interview with Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, or even Maggie Gyllenhaal for crying out loud.          What this \\"bonus\\" disc does offer are some images of irrelevant Joker Cards, and fake Gotham News Broadcasts that are merely a prelude to the film and quite frankly are long and boring. There are also two documentaries that explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne and Batman as well as a technological look at the gadgets Batman uses. While these are fairly intriguing, they offer nothing new or dynamic because I had already watched both of these documentaries on the History Channel before the film was even released.         The only thing that is remotely satisfactory, in terms of \\"Special Features\\", doesn't even come on the second disc, but rather the first. The \\"Creation of a Scene\\" which offers an inside look at the setup and preparation of some of the films major stunt sequences is interesting and I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of these segments there were. Disappointingly, the majority of these segments don't last more than a minute or two but perhaps there is enough content there to satisfy the casual viewer.         Overall I'm happy to finally have my very own copy of such a wonderful film, I just hope that the next time Warner Bros. decides to produce a DVD and make an attempt at incorporating so called \\"special\\" features, they might think about including a Director's Commentary or even a Main Menu for that matter. I would suggest they just make these adjustments for the release of a \\"Special Edition\\" DVD, but two bad it has already been released and it is no different.
0385338732|5.0|Despite reading the rave reviews of this book I was skeptical of whether it would be worth reading.  All though I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series I was less captivated by her later books, Undomestic Goddess and Can You Keep a Secret? as well as those written by her as Madeleine Wickham.  After finishing this book, however, I was not only pleasantly surprised, but found I enjoyed it equally as much as the Shopaholic series.  This book follows the story of 28-year-old Lexi Smart as she awakes with amnesia after an accident and cannot remember the last three years of her life.  Navigating her new life she initially feels like she has stepped into a fairy tale until she slowly comes to find that not everything is as it appears.  Although this premise, as others have alluded to, has been done before Kinsella covers it skillfully in a way that is engaging from start to finish.  She throws in enough twists and turns along the way that while the book is somewhat predictable, the reader is still surprised and entertained by how things unfold.  She especially succeeds bringing her main character to life.  Lexi is likeable, multidimensional and easy to relate to.  Even if you have never experienced amnesia (which I am sure many readers will have not) the character deals with plenty of things that are relatable like family drama, romantic relationship challenges, and the loss of a friendship.  She also infuses a lot of humor into the book, as she did with the Shopaholic series, which makes for a fun, breezy read.  I, like many other readers, also appreciated that she did not tie all of the loose ends up at the end of the book, which would have made it seem too contrived.  Like many of her Shopaholic books I found myself always eager to read the next chapter and happily devoured it in three days.  Overall this is a great book that is a perfect read while on vacation or curling up at home.  Like most Chick Lit it's no literary wonder, but it is funny, relatable, and great fun.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Blood Mountain is amazing! It's a conceptual album the tells the story of a hero who is in search of a Crystal Skull which he must place on top of Blood Mountain. Along the way he runs into an assortment of dangers including a one-eyed sasquatch and a race of tree people called Birchmen. But even if you don't get the story, it's just an amazing album musically. The guitars are really heavy, and the vocals are intense... but the drums are just insane! Mastodon's drummer Brann Dailor is absolutely incredible. Just listen to the drums on any of the songs. The drums are just as heavy as the guitars. The whole album has a truly mystical, somewhat creepy feel which I love. It's an awesome combination of fantasy/mythology and virtuosic music. This is a great, great album that any music lover should own. Even people who aren't fans of heavy metal should really check it out. Check out everything by Mastodon as well.
0385338732|4.0|When I heard this was a book about amnesia, I thought 'Oh, no! Not again!'. But i was pleasantly surprised. Kinsella's narrative is engaging, I felt like I knew the characters, and found myself rooting for them. And she hasn't lost her touch where humor is concerned, either.<br />Perfect Christmas gift for anyone who loves a fun, light-hearted read!
B0007PAMBK|4.0|I love this movie!  I saw this film a while ago (the Criterion Collection edition) and was amazed by the interesting storyline.  And the film is just over an hour so it's a fast paced story.<br /><br />Herk Harvey and John Clifford came up with an interesting concept: Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) gets into what should have been a fatal car accident during a drag race.  She is uneasy in town, but she is leaving anyways to take a job as a church organist (although to her its just a job and the church is a place of business).  On her way there, she is stalked by a ghostly/ghastly man (scarily played by Herk himself).  She becomes even more paranoid when it appears as though people treat her like she doesn't exist.  The story comes to a thrilling conclusion with visually stunning scenes at the old carnival.<br /><br />I cannot explain why I like this film, I just do.  I think the colorization is actually well done.  I have yet to listen to the humorous commentary so I cannot rate that.  Although, if you have the extra money I would go for the Criterion Collection: the film is cleaned up so the great cinematography at the end is crisp, as well as having the director's cut.<br /><br />But this copy more than satisfies my cult obsession with a low budget masterpiece.  Highly recommend!!
B000YAA68C|3.0|P.S. I Love You is a sweet, teary chick flick that I kinda liked in spite of myself. I read the book that this movie was based on a few years ago, and though the movie differed significantly from the book in some key areas, I found myself enjoying it.<br /><br />Here's the skinny: Young Holly is married to Gerry, an Irish musician. The two live in a cramped walk-up apartment in New York, and they are trying to save some money and \\"make a plan\\" to start their family.<br /><br />Reality intervenes. Gerry is diagnosed with a brain tumor and passes away. Holly is adrift in grief. Then, on her 30th birthday, a cake and a small tape recorder arrive at her doorstep. It's a message from Gerry. Apparently, Gerry planned these occasional messages to her for the first year after his death.<br /><br />Each message gives Holly an assignment - buy a bedside lamp, go out with her girlfriends, take a vacation, find a better job. The assignments are Gerry's way of making sure that Holly's life goes on without him. (Sweet, no?)<br /><br />I thought that Swank did a good job in this film, making a sometimes inscrutable character likable and warm. Butler was wonderful as Gerry, and there was a fabulous (all too brief) performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan that practically had me weak in the knees. Harry Connick Jr. played Daniel, Holly's long-suffering friend, pretty well, too. (Oh, and Holly's clothes were really fun! Kudos to the costumer on that one.)<br /><br />To recap - this is not a tour de force. This movie will not change your life or even make you think about it that much. But it will entertain you, and you may have to grab a Kleenex for some of the scenes. Great for a night in with the girls.
0956010903|5.0|I've been a loyal Harry Potter fan for 10 years (since I was 13) and I received mine in the mail today and I'm very pleased with it! I originally ordered mine as a birthday present to myself and my parents ended up purchasing it for me but paying the costs.<br /><br />Talk about excellent luck too -- although released on the 4th of December it arrived TODAY for my birthday on the 10th! This was also the Amazon.com expected delivery date on my order. So absolutely no issues with shipping there!<br /><br />The outer shell -- designed to look like a Hogwarts book -- is simply beautiful. The etching of the \\"Tales of the Beedle Bard\\" on the leather is exquisite and flawless.<br /><br />When I opened my book the velvet pouch lays very snugly in a spot made for it. The pouch itself is very soft and the golden strings at the top are excellent quality. On the pouch is J.K. Rowling's signature in gold stitching. The velvet is a crimson color.<br /><br />Then on the left side of the book, once you open it, is a slip/pocket. Inside of this slip is an envelope. Inside of the envelop are copies of pictures on top quality card stock paper. These pictures represent the pictures from the stories in the book and are replicas of hand drawings.<br /><br />Now on to the little book itself! The actual \\"Tales of the Beedle Bard\\" includes an introduction by Albus Dumbledore and states that it is translated by Hermione Granger! I mean I love this aspect of it. It's just like J.K. Rowling's Hogwarts textbooks with Harry and Ron's scribbles all over them. I think it's a very sweet addition to all of J.K.'s \\"other\\" books. It's a sweet addition, I as a loyal fan, appreciate.<br /><br />The actual little book is exactly as it looks. It's rather heavy actually, and the metal decorations are perfect. My clasp on the book is perfect (though as other reviewers pointed out, it's not exactly in the center -- but mine is only about two millimeters below center if so much. You can't tell unless you REALLY look at it, which is what I did to make sure). On the metal decorations are these blue gems. The same blue gems are on the entire book -- I would describe these gems are a cross between royal blue and sky blue.<br /><br />My one thing about the gems though is they don't look like the best quality and I don't really like them -- but I can overlook that because I really like the rest of the packaging of the entire set as whole.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of that would be wrong with this package is that the big shell book isn't as high of quality as I would like. But that by no means implies that it is 'bad' quality -- because it is NOT. It's just not as great as I would have hoped it to be.<br /><br />Otherwise, I have no problems with my set and I love it very, very, very much. It's an excellent Birthday present to me (from my parents)!<br /><br />Also, I read a couple of reviews discussing the Amazon packaging. Let me address that. My package came in a white box that said Amazon.com on it. It did infact say \\"Tales of the Beedle Bard\\" on it as well as \\"Muggles don't ship/open until December 4.\\" This however, did NOT bother me, as it did other people. So I suppose that issue is a matter of opinion -- also considering I purchased this for myself, and then my parents ended up paying me for me, and making into their present to me, as I didn't want or need anything else there year.<br /><br />A new Harry Potter book is enough to make me happy -- especially one this gorgeous!!!<br /><br />So for someone who grew up with the Potter series or for someone who became a fan a matter of weeks ago, I really think this is an excellent present for you or a friend. And! -- All your $$$ money goes to charity! So you did a good deed too  :o)<br />From one fan to another -- it's an excellent buy!<br /><br />I give it 5 of 5 excellent, awesome, sparkling stars!!!e).

0316779237|3.0|I'm a big David Sedaris fan. I think that Me Talk Pretty One Day is one of the funniest books I've ever read. I've checked out several of his books, the most recent being Holidays on Ice, a collection of holiday-themed comic essays.<br /><br />If you've seen the stage production of Santaland Diaries, then the anchor story in this collection will be very familiar to you. It details Sedaris' stint as a Macy's Christmas elf one year, and it is freaking hilarious. From the humiliating \\"uniform\\" to the strict instructions by the Gestapo-like Macy's Christmas management team, you will chuckle during this one.<br /><br />I found the rest of the book a bit uneven. \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" went on far too long, as did \\"Christmas Means Giving,\\" which took one joke and spun it out for more than 10 pages. I did enjoy reading \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" though, as well as \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol.\\"<br /><br />Though every story isn't a gem, the book is a quick read and worth checking out if you're in the mood for some subversive holiday humor.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0895260131|5.0|This book is a must-read for every American and European. Well-written and well-documented, this book illuminates the current events in the news and shows the historical context of the current strife in the Middle East.  I am buying several copies for friends and family, and recommend that you do the same.
0440238153|3.0|Pullman is an excellent writer. His stories are wonderfully told. The characters are engaging, and the plot certianly clips along. He has a powerful imagination.<br /><br />However, he is dealing with very heavy subject matter here to be calling his books \\"young adult\\" fiction. I can totally see why organized religion has a problem with his books. Organized religion, in this trilogy, is the enemy/villain. God himself, and his cadre of angels, are the characters that the protagonists fight against (and defeat). While I think these books can be fruitful reads for adults, as they stimulate thought on topics not traditionally entertained (much like Sophie's World, which I really enjoyed), I would not want my, say, 12-year-old kid reading this stuff. It's hard enough trying to teach your child to comprehend the immensity of the world, God, faith, good/evil, without Pullman undoing all you've tried to instill.<br /><br />Sooooo, if you're interested in theology, and you're over 18, read these books. If you're part of the backpack set, though, you might want to talk with your parents about them first.
B00009V7T2|1.0|Man, I would have fought someone if I actually had to pay for this \\"album\\".  I found it orphaned in a fairly appropriate section of the music store 'Lame, overrated & annoying \\"music\\"'.  Now I know why music was in quotation marks... Some guy at the store actually offered me a gold tooth, a half eaten pack of candy cigarettes and a letter opener just to take it because it was ruining his store's mojo.  Did I get the short end of the stick or what...?  Although, the candy cigarettes were delicious and only semi-stale from the 80's.     To call this revolutionary or evolutionary or progressive or any other term aside from 'wwwhhhhaaaaa?' bashes everything respectable people call \\"Music\\".  The guy 'singing' hurts my ears... does a guy 'singing' (more like wailing; like a fruity hollowness where once stood a man) ever really work?  I read a few reviews here where people compared their songs to Pink Floyd & Hendrix and whoever else...  man, y'all must be talking about 'Sammy Boyd & the Pink Floyds' or 'Larry Hendrix' because this doesn't resemble punk rock, classic rock, progressive rock,  or even Fraggle rock in the slightest.  I kept waiting for some music -- drums, guitars... anything really -- and all I got was confusion.  Are they trying to be hardcore or progressive?  For all I know, they may be trying to perform Country music because I couldn't get past the vocalist screaming into my ear.     The only halfway respectable musician in the whole bunch was Flea...  wait, did I just type Flea?  What is Flea doing playing bass on this album?  He hasn't been part of a great musical group since JA's old albums (note:  that Strays albums was awful too) and the last somewhat respectable Red Hot Chili Pepper's album 'One Hot Minute'... so if this came out in 2003, that puts him a good 5 or 6 years past his selling out point.  Ahh yes, that explains why he is playing bass on this particular album, he lost his musical soul years ago.    But, in all fairness...  the group doeshave one good selling point, the music may actually be good but I wouldn't know because I can't concentrate beyond the lead singer's incessant whining.    Get a grip kiddos, turn off the MTV or \\"Rockin' Dan & Rollin' Susan in the PM\\" radio, pick up some real music with soul.  I like how one guy put it and I paraphrase, 'They came along at just the right time in musical history where they weren't off'd like a plague but instead given a gold medal and millions of dollars' -- or something like that.  If you don't know where to begin, just let me know and I'll help direct you or check with any of the other 1 star rating givers here -- I'm pretty sure they can direct you as well.     Thanks for your time!
B000YJ85VS|4.0|It is hard to design experiments that reveal something that hasn't been explored before, and to do it in the field that interests almost everybody. It is even harder to know your limitations, and to stay within your field of competence. Especially if your name is Dan Ariely.  The book describes a good number of experiments which demonstrate irrational behaviour  of humans in a variety of situations. Not all are eye-opening, especially if you know SOME behavioural psychology, but overwhelming majority are curious at the very least. If nothing else, you will chuckle at students who prefer the \\"MIT brew\\" (beer + balsamic vinegar) over beer by a wide margin UNLESS they are told the ingredients, and patients who are cured by a placebo, provided they are told it is EXPENSIVE.  Unfortunately, the author is not satisfied with simply summarising his experiments and letting the reader draw the conclusions. He offers his own, and they range from slightly overreaching to wildly speculative. It is somewhat forgivable that Mr. Ariely thinks that even the most limited of his experiments reveal something profoundly deep about human nature. But it gets outright silly when he offers his opinion, in the authoritative tone of an expert, in the matters of economics and public policy, as he reveals his total ignorance in both subjects.  I still recommend this book to almost anyone with an interest in popular psychology. With the abundance of remarkable information to digest, and the author's hubris will be just a small annoyance to a smart reader.
B000UJCALI|5.0|I am quite pleased to say that The Shining not only lives up to it's reputation but even exceeded nearly all the horror films that have come out since.  The Shining is chilling, it's a subtle movie, at least by today's standards, it is brilliant on levels Hollywood has seems to have forgotten.<br /><br />The subtle special effects are never overdone, never desensitizing us by overstimulating the horror factor over and over again until all the scares blend together.  The absolutely fantastic cinematography and camera direction.  The grand low shots following Danny at his own eye level as he rides around the hotel builds the terror of our expectations and then often denying us what we expect resulting in even greater impact when something paranormal does appear.  The increasingly claustrophobic and uncomfortable shots make us feel like we are just as trapped there as Wendy.  Finally the chaos that surounds Jack as he goes more and more insane.  All of these are perfect in their effectiveness.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's performance is flawless and and every bit as riveting as the cinematography, I can't imagine how they could have found anyone more perfect for the part.  Danny Lloyd also does a terrific job, especially when his imaginary friend comes out to play.  Shelley Duvall's acting on the other end was fine but did stick out as the weakest part of the movie, but it gets the job done.<br /><br />Of course, all this wouldn't be worth a thing of the story hadn't been so well written, Steven King obviously providing great source material while Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson's adaptation bringing the novel alive in cinema.  All of this a testament to Kubrick's skill as a director.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it you really need to, if you have seen it maybe you should see it again and try to appreciate it on a completely different level, I promise it won't disappoint.
0316067598|5.0|1.  I'll keep it short and sweet--> the best, most inspiring, and sobering book I've read this year.<br /><br />2.  It brings the hard realities of the world back into focus and reminds one to be grateful for all we have as well as to be eternally grateful to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />3.  On a practical note--> I found the book well written, easy to read etc...
0060833459|4.0|Good book which truly aims to measure executive contribution. All managers should read this so that they can manage their work better and also set useful, realistic benchmarks for their subordinates.     Far too many managers today are too caught up in their own world today.
0142000671|1.0|I did not like this book at all. I had to read it in eighth grade. It was so difficult to understand the interactions between the characters. Although the story itself was okay, it was nothing special at all and it isn't something I would look forward to reading. The WORST part is the end, it's VERY SAD. It's the WORST ending I have ever read in a book. I was hoping the book would end happy, but, just like the rest of the book, the ending sucks as well. I don't get how these books become famous. Maybe an adult would like it, but definitely not someone who is in middle school or high school. If you are a teenager, read something like realistic fiction that takes place in a school setting or at least in a more modern setting. Something that is interesting to what you do. Or something like a mystery or a fantasy. I don't get how a book this bad (in my opinion) could become SO famous. This is probably because this is a book ADULTS read and it shouldn't be read by kids my age. If you are unfortunate to have to read this book, GOOD LUCK. Hopefully you will like it, but I only recommend this to adults who like difficult classic \\"literature\\" style books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this about a week ago.  After the first time I did it my legs hurt so bad I could barely walk for two days.  I did it again though and I feel great.  I totally feel like this is a great workout.  I have the same complaint as everyone else-that you can't fast forward through the intro.  I use the time to get my mat and weights.  Oh and turn the heat down because you're definitely going to work up a sweat!
0765342294|2.0|Have you ever had the feeling when you were drawn into a book? Have you ever felt like you were hooked and loved reading it? I hoped my experience reading Ender's Game would be like this. I went to a book store to pick out this book that was on a list of possible books to read over the summer. I needed to chose one to read. This book is LONG with SMALL print. It's 300+ pages! I had 3 weeks before school started. My dad and the store clerk told me stories of people saying \\"My teenager won't read, but then when he picked up this book, he couldn't stop reading.\\" I got convinced and put down a book that I was going to get since it was less than 200 pages. I was convinced I would enjoy reading a book that was longer, but \\"more interesting\\". I chose Ender's Game. I read and kept waiting for the moment where I would be \\"drawn into the book\\". I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting...Guess What...THAT MOMENT NEVER CAME. I never had the feeling I was drawn into the book. It was still good, but nothing special. I gave it two stars since when I look back on it, it wasn't too bad of a reading experience. But I had very little time to finish the book, and it was 300+ pages of stuff that didn't interest me. I have had past experiences of being \\"drawn into the book\\", I enjoy those, it makes reading more fun, even if it's for school (which reading for school usually isn't as fun). I hoped that it would happen with this book, but it didn't. Me and my dad have learned to think harder before assuming I will get drawn into the book. So overall, this book is LONG. 300+ pages of SMALL print. If you really enjoy stuff about battling and wars, you may like this book. I like that stuff, but I didn't like the details on it this book explained. Overall, it wasn't a good match for me. Think hard before committing to reading this. Also, since this is a long book, I would recommend reading it for fun, not for a school assignment (unless you absolutely have to).
B001GKJ2F2|2.0|Okay having read the graphic novel that this is based on I understand why they took so little from the book but the disappointing part is that they could have gone so much further had the script writers tried even a little.      It's a weird movie that seems to have no real point and did nothing more than use big screen names to produce something that is at best, mediocre.  Accomplishing  nothing more than to generate a payday.    If you have an unlimited budget then add this to your collection if not then go buy \\"IRON MAN \\" or  \\"THE HULK\\" instead m\maybe even a \\"SHREK\\"   movie.   If you are going to buy this movie then stop reading now if not the following are the things that kind of        Wesley's transformation period followed the book pretty much ( not a bad thing),and followed it even when he killed his father.and right here the script seemed to run out of gas and then Sloan admits his to his corruption \\" I did it to save all of you\\", when the obvious reason that all their names came out of the \\"Loom of Destiny \\" is that because \\"Sloan's\\" name came up and was not acted on. Just kill \\"Sloan\\" !     Also the girl saves Wesley's butt by killing everyone  and herself, I mean was this script written by a bunch of suicide bombers or what. Come on she kills everyone and herself because of a misplaced( believed in Sloan not the cloth (on a side note nobody bothers to check... please!!)) belief.
B0002X314C|1.0|Augh! This late review comes because I was never a fan/ never bought the CD. Ordinary People was cute but I have been in this business long enough to know a one-hit wonder when I hear one. Due to weekend circumstances, I was made to listen to this CD and its various selections repeatedly. I think I would have preferred fingernails on a chalkboard to this CD. Nothing on this disc has the magic of Ordinary People and Sony may have been better off (from a non-cash-in standpoint) going the full-on acoustic/ adult contemporary route with this artist. I actually thought that's where they were headed \\"then\\" but I later got a whiff of the follow up... while at the cinema of all places. While waiting for my feature presentation to begin, they actually played the video. Great marketing there as people will undoubtedly think they have been enlightened when relieved of those dull, boring slides. The song's name and melody escape me at the moment... Case in point, no? Now, the man has got talent. It's just showcased poorly here. And that's why it's so irritating. I read the negative reviews about lyrical content. Fortunately or unfortunately for me, I was so irritated by the vocal/ music pairing that I didn't even allow my mind to process the lyrics. Having only heard Ordinary People in awards ceremonies near the time of its release, I can still pull its melodies and a bit of the words from my memory. Having heard the full CD just four days ago, I can't recall anything other than the chorus of Let's Get Lifted.
0956010903|4.0|I Pre-ordered this in October, along with the standard edition, so that my boyfriend and I can have one to beat up on and one to sit prettily on the shelf. I was a little disappointed because i thought that all the stories would be the handwritten copies in the collector's edition ( which would make it totally the best and well worth the 100 bucks!) however they are not, it is only the introduction that is handwritten. Amazon does say that though, i just didn't read clearly enough, The illustrations are fantastic, and i've asked for frames for christmas to hang them in our library. Other than that it is a very cute little book, if you are a collector then i would recommend this, but it doesn't really deviate that much from the standard edition, you get the same stores, presented the same way.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Amazing film, very dissapointed that this film didn't include a director's commentary in the Special Features.
1595141979|5.0|Being a big fan of Vampire Academy, I was very eager for Shadow Kiss to be released, and it did not disappoint! The novel cranked out fresh plots and the beloved characters continued to intrigue me. The ending was so sad, it had me in tears. I'm anxious to find out what happens in the next VA installment!! I can't get enough of this series!
0930289234|3.0|What I really liked about this story was that a majority of the characters don't have any \\"super powers\\" beyond their own will.  They're a group of very flawed people forcing their interpretation of the law on others for various reasons beyond simple \\"justice\\".<br />The twist at the end was pretty nice and reminded me of an old science fiction short story I read years ago about an astronaut stranded in orbit.  I won't say anymore otherwise I might give away the twist for those who've not read it.<br />I'm really looking forward the movie now.  ;)
0156030209|4.0|Life of Pi is an allegory about religion and how we individually assimilate the world and its meaning.  The book has two distinct parts.  The first half of the novel is Pi's life as the son of a zookeeper, followed by his survival at sea after a ship wreak.      The author does an excellent job of tying these to halves of his novel together in the final chapter.  The book ends enigmatically, asking the reader to ponder his or her own belief system.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|I don't do dark.  True, occasionally I'll find something dark I do enjoy, but that is the rare exception.  There's a reason I stick to family entertainment, I truly enjoy it.<br /><br />Which is why I was so surprised I enjoyed Batman Begins when it hit the theaters three years ago.  Despite the dark tone of the preview for this movie, I decided to see it.  I'm sorry I did.<br /><br />The criminal element in Gotham City is on the run.  It's really a triple effort thanks to Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman), and new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).<br /><br />But just as they are centering in on the leaders of organized crime, a new villain emerges.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) is attempting to become the next leader, getting all the other criminals behind him.  And as he wins their confidence, things get worse in the city.  Can Batman save the day?<br /><br />The movie started out fine with a few laughs to lighten the mood and an interesting story.  But as it progressed, it really fell apart.<br /><br />Part of the problem was the overly gruesome nature.  Oh, I'll grant you that there was little if any blood.  But there were still some images that were truly horrific.  How this movie escaped the R rating it deserved is beyond me.<br /><br />Then there are the story issues.  The writers bit off more story then they could chew, even in two and a half hours.  Complicating the problem is the random nature of the Joker.  The end result is a movie that feels so scattered in the final hour it's hard to figure out what any one's motives are any more.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed the most about the last movie was the character development.  Here, it's completely lacking.  It would have taken away too much from the gruesome images and explosions, I guess.  Instead, we get a few attempts at development, all of which come across as forced and trite.<br /><br />But I can't blame that on the writer alone.  I honestly felt like most of the cast was just going through the motions, making it hard for me to find anything to grab on to.  Potential love interest Rachel Dawes was one of my favorite characters in the first movie.  The roll is taken over here by Maggie Gyllenhaal who is only passable.  One of the few exceptions was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent.<br /><br />The other exception was the late Heath Ledger.  He was brilliant as the Joker.  I couldn't look away when he was on screen even if I wanted to.  All the praise he has gotten for the part is well deserved.  In fact, his acting job earns the movie its second star.<br /><br />Now I know what you are thinking, \\"What did you expect from a movie with Dark in the title?\\"  And you're right, I have only myself to blame for sitting through it.  But if you are like me and don't like darker movies, take my experience to heart and walk away from this film.ing to grab on to.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I'm a huge Christmas music fan and consider myself a Christmas music aficionado.  At last count I had five 8-tracks, 4 cassettes, 18 LP's, and 64 CDs.  This doesn't include the downloaded singles on my computer.  I truly enjoy Christmas music much more than the average person.  My particular passion is for the older, more nostalgic music that embodies the Christmas spirit, warmth, nostalgia, and traditions - primarily the 50's through the mid-70's.  I do have a lot of music from the 80's to the present, but my fondness is for the good 'ole classics from Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Ed Ames, John Denver & The Muppets (you must hear this one - see my review), The Partridge Family (yes, the Partridge Family), Elvis, Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams - you get the point.    I already owned the first release of Christmas Portrait and did not realize this two-disc set was available until I stumbled across it here on amazon.  Even without all the wonderful reviews I knew I would love this set.    I agree with others that if you own only the LP from the late 70's (I do!) or the single-disc version that came out in the 80's or 90's (have that!), you must get this two-disc offering.    The track listing on amazon for disc one (Christmas Portrait) isn't exactly correct due to a minor omission of O Come, O Come Emmanuel, which is a 28 second intro to the Overture, which is really track 2.  Not a big deal, just a technicality.    Richard's attention to detail for these albums, along with the arrangements, Richard's piano pieces on some of these songs (if memory serves me correctly, he didn't play on all of the arrangements) is phenomenal.  Aside from Karen's angelic voice, the arrangements for these songs really make these albums and truly capture and embody that Christmas feeling and the nostalgia.    What I find interesting about these arrangements is that Karen's voice is not heard on all of the songs, which was intentional. That in NO way makes this anything less than fantastic.  The chorus on these songs brings back the days of old - I can almost smell that wonderful tinsel while listening to these discs.    This is a must-have for anyone who thoroughly enjoys Christmas music whether or not you are a fan of the Carpenters or even know who they are.    This is one of the best Christmas albums/discs ever recorded.  Period.
032147404X|5.0|I consider myself a newbie or amateur when it comes to photography, specifically DSLRs. After purchasing my first SLR a few years back I decided to learn some tricks by reading through the owner's manual.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years later and I've managed to take some great shots with my camera, but I was looking for that next level. I decided to give this book a shot and was thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />First of all, the book is a quick read.  Each page covers a specific topic and the author is straight to the point. The premise of the book is that Scott Kelby shows you a shot, then tells you how to mimic the results using your own camera. If you're just starting out, this is exactly what you're going to want to know. I've been able to put some of the techniques to work and I am looking forward to using a few more. The $12 I paid for the book just made the price I paid for my camera worthwhile.<br /><br />This book is especially great if you own either a Nikon or Canon DSLR, since Scott shows you the menus and settings you have to go through to take shots. Also, you get some tips on equipment you may want to look into and some Photoshop tricks.<br /><br />Overall, the book packs a lot of information into a small package with some wit and humor. This is a must-have for anyone getting into digital photography.

0743289692|5.0|I had never heard of the author until that afternoon I was browsing my local Barnes & Noble. I am glad I did. This book was a very inciteful look into the Muslim culture from a woman's perspective. And that's as far as I take it. It is a place to start from and gather more knowledge and varying perspectives. I think she was very courageous to give us a glimpse into the pain, rebirth and redemption she now emboddies. I hope her voice is never bound and continues to speak out. The main critique I've read is that she lied, but none of that has been corroborated as far as I know.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams: An American president whose name isn't as well known as many others. He was a 1-term president from Massachusetts, sandwiched in between two 2-term presidents from Virginia--George Washington and Thomas Jefferson--whose portraits appear on our coinage and currency. (Yes, there are still some $2 bills floating around.)<br /><br />I caught only snippets of the miniseries, but from what I saw, I knew I had to see the entire story. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are both excellent in this movie, and the more I see Paul Giamatti, the more I realize what a fine actor he is.<br /><br />John Adams was a man of conviction, honesty, trustworthiness, stubbornness, and intellect. He became very frustrated when he saw evil and ineptitude, and he was very outspoken. Perhaps some of these characteristics pushed him into the background of history and caused him to be unpopular during his lifetime, but two hundred years later, I believe that many have come to appreciate him as a great leader--a man misunderstood by too many others.<br /><br />If you missed the HBO series on TV, get the DVD. Especially if you are passionate about history as I am, you will greatly enjoy this miniseries.
0307269752|4.0|I hadn't read a mystery/thriller in awhile when I came across this posthumous book by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. This international bestseller was very engrossing. The first fifty pages or so got a little bogged down in a description of a libel case. I almost gave up. Once the mystery got introduced, however, I was hooked. I must warn you..this book is not for the faint of heart. There is a great deal of violence towards women and gruesome depictions of sadism. I couldn't put it down, though. After the resolution of the mystery, the story gets bogged down once again in the libel case. I can't understand the reasoning behind such a clunky plot device. The author bookended an \\"unputdownable\\" story with a boring beginning and ending. I still enjoyed the book, however, and look forward to the release of the next book in the trilogy.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|As was to be expected, Loreena produced a magnificent CD. Although I love most Christmas songs, I grow tired of so many \\"modern\\" versions that singers and arrangers try to \\"improve\\" with their own styles, frequently ruining them (in my opinion). However, Loreena has created fresh, yet traditional renditions of several Christmas and pre-Christmas songs.<br /><br />For a long time I have been drawn to music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, as well as to Celtic and Middle Eastern music. This album blends them all beautifully, and when listening, I feel that I have been transported back to a time long ago. Of course, her beautiful voice and outstanding orchestral accompaniment are absolutely top notch.<br /><br />Whether or not you are a Loreena McKennitt fan, you will be happy with this CD. Trust me.
1439102813|5.0|Brief summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Alice Howland is a brilliant professor of psychology at Harvard University. She  is 50 years old, she has 3 children, and a husband named John, who also works for Harvard.<br /><br />Even though Alice is exceptional and unusual in that she is so scholarly, she still has normal concerns for someone her age - she has an awkward relationship with her youngest daughter Lydia, because she disagrees with her career choice of being an actress. She also feels that some of the romance has gone out of her relationship with John, and there is a tenseness over his support of Lydia. All pretty pedestrian and typical problems for a 50 year old married woman.<br /><br />But then Alice starts to suffer some memory loss, beyond the typical things that can be attributed to a woman undergoing menopause. She sees a doctor, and we, the readers, follow her as she goes through tests and eventually is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.<br /><br />The story takes place over a 2 year period of time, as we follow what happens to her, both through her POV and those of her family.<br /><br />It's a devastating story, and as someone who is getting older and suffering my own problems with memory loss, I can tell you that this book was terrifying - yet I could not put it down.  I found myself carrying it around all day long just so I could keep reading it, which is unusual for me. I read a lot, but it's rare to feel so compelled to keep reading that I cannot stop.<br /><br />For that reason, I give this book 5 stars, and will recommend it to all of my friends. In many ways the book seems like nonfiction, since the author goes out of her way to educate the reader as to the diagnosis of this disease, the treatment,  and the the terrible process of deterioration.<br /><br />I would normally think that a book that tries to educate the reader like this would be too pedantic, or boring - but it is neither of those things. I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down.<br /><br />So my only quibble? Alice's children, and their interactions with her. I didn't doubt that they could be supportive and loving, but I'm not sure that the devastating toll this illness has on a family was depicted completely realistically. They were rarely impatient or frustrated - especially at the end when they were basically taking care of her full-time, along with their own busy lives.<br /><br />But this is a minor quibble, and this is really Alice's story.<br /><br />I don't know if this book would have the same impact on everyone, but in my circumstances, as someone who is dealing with her own father's Alzheimer's and as someone who occasionally can't think of the right words or names, this book was both moving and wrenching.with her.

B001FBJULI|1.0|I have to admit I held off buying this after reading Paul \\"Slop\\"'s review Loaded with errors... but finding it at a discounted price recently, I decided I have to see for myself... and the verdict: Yes, he was right, it's bad. How can I not compare the New Order remastering to Depeche Mode's? Without doubt, the Depeche remasterings, all of them, are amazing, well worth re-purchasing them for the rich dynamic sound, blowing away the original masters, and the extras are awesome... New Order came about the same time as Depeche, Depeche is with Warner as is New Order... so what went wrong here??? Why didn't Hook or Sumner overlook the remasterings as The Edge has been doing for U2 recently? Bottom line: I am a huge fan of remastering, I love the clearer, richer sound, and this is the first time EVER that I say the remastering is maybe just a hair better than the original issue! And the bonus disc remastering is absolutely awful. I couldn't listen to it more than once.  THE MUSIC, HOWEVER, IS OUTSTANDING! I HOPE THEY REMASTER THE REMASTERS, PROPERLY.

It will create such beauty in your holiday celebrations.
0810993139|5.0|I read this book in one sitting today.  It is \\"a novel in cartoons\\", it says on the cover.  More specifically, it is the fictional diary of a middle school boy, with drawings.  It is very funny.  Several times I laughed out loud while reading it.  If you want to find out of this book would appeal to you, search for the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" website and check out some of the diary entries.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|Roman Polanski's film Tess, (1979) adaptation of Thomas Hardy famous novel of the 19th century \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\", won many prestigious awards, including three Oscars of six nominations and every award for Best Cinematography it was nominated for. If any film deserves recognition for its beautiful, lyrical, sensual yet melancholic and poetic visual presentation, \\"Tess\\" is it. The movie might be Roman Polanski's finest achievement, and this statement comes from a viewer who is in love with  all Polanski's films starting with his debut \\"Knife in the Water\\". \\"Tess\\" is one of the best adaptations of the classic novel I've seen and it lives, breathes and moves freely. It never rushes to tell its long story but tells it with rare finesse, compassion, and love for the heroine, a gentle creature who had been insulted, humiliated, and ultimately destroyed.<br /><br />The success of the movie starts with the choice of the actress for the title role. Tess as played by 20 years old Nasstassia Kisnki is beautiful, sensual, shy and full of life and hope for love. The life of Tess unfolds in front of us from her teenage years as an innocent country girl until the powerfully tragic final scene at the magnificent Stonehenge. The film is almost three hours long but I never was bored, on the contrary, I felt compassion for the girl and anger toward the men that used and corrupted her, ruined her hopes for love and happiness, and toward the society that mercifully discarded of her. Tess is one of the best movies I've seen. It is stunning, subtle, emotional, tragic, and unforgettable.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|I can almost hear the discussions that went on between James Poyser, ?uestlove and Al Green before the first song was recorded. The debates about whether they should attempt to update Al's sound or go really retro. I'm sure we've all debated what Marvin Gaye would sound like if he was still alive? I think Al Green gives an interesting perspective on that question. If his latest CD is anything to go by, then I think the answer would be `exactly the way he did when he was alive and thank God for that'<br /><br />That is what Al Green does on his latest album, he does the music he's most famous for, no reinventions, evolutions or experimentations. This is Al Green as my folks would remember. I'm not a scholar of his music but I've felt the impact of his music through hip-hop. I found this to be a brilliant introduction to the good reverend.<br /><br />Words cannot describe how great this album is, I'm scratching my head wondering whether he was always this good or if this is special even by his own standards. This is by some distance my favourite album of the year (in any genre)<br /><br />He is no magician with the pen and a close inspection of some of the lyrics reveals many shortcomings. `Lay It Down' is a prime example of what I'm referring to. Al Green's trump card is his butter smooth delivery (to borrow from my genre of choice, hip-hop) and his voice which is reminiscent of Mr. Biggs from the Isley brothers. He's a child of soul and every track on the album is drenched in it.<br /><br />Credit also has to go to his production team whose interpretation of Al Green sound is no interpretation at all but the real thing. I'll be honest when ?uestlove started talking about making an album with Al Green 2 years ago I was skeptical. I thought the album would never see the light of day or would end up like his interpretation of Pharrell's \\"In My Mind\\".<br /><br />Enlisting the assistance of Anthony Hamilton (who is probably the only artist who can even come close to Al), Corrine Bailey Rae and John Legend was also a master stroke.<br /><br />Bravo Mr Green, excellent albumalso a master stroke.    Bravo Mr Green, excellent album
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I'm a big fan of Pink, and I buy all her albums. Fun House is another great CD. It's fun poppy and a totally feel good album with great emotion and rocking tracks too!A good buy and A+++ Pink - album for you collection!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I listened to all the songs on this album and despite 2 songs which sounded like they have been there and done that like, \\"I'de come for you\\" and \\"Just to get high\\".

B001GM0GNC|2.0|If you are a diehard Police fan then this disc set is for you.  I myself am a big fan and love their music but found this concert boring.  The mistake I may have made is that I purchased the latest ZZ Top, Elton John and Rush concert videos at the same time I purchased the Police set. With the first three you can see how they work very hard at making the songs sound like you remember them.  They also work very hard at entertaining you.  The Police do neither on this disc.  They come across bored and lazy as many of the songs are changed just enough to make them nearly unrecognizable until well into the lyrics. While it is fun to hear an updated version of a song from time to time, way too much of it happens here.  You can see that they obviously still have the talant and ability to perform, but they either didn't care to or thought we wouldn't notice if they didn't.  I have well over 50 live DVD sets from all types of music genre and performers and this one ranks at the bottom.  Again, if you are a diehard fan, you will probably like it, casual fans should just stick to the outsatnding CD's of the past.
0143038095|3.0|Okay, first off, I love Amy Tan. Anyone who can create Sagwa is okay with me. ^-^<br /><br />But, I had to read this book for a project in school. It was one of the hardest reads for me. It was so hard to follow initially because it's told in first person...by like...what, 6 different characters? I got the gyst of it, and it WAS an interesting story, but you really have to buckle down to follow it, in my opinion.<br /><br />Personally, I had to watch the movie to pick up things I missed in the book. It was easier to keep track of the characters that way. But, like I said, that's just me. The book WAS an interesting one and a very good story...just a little hard to follow.

It doesn't have illustrations and doesn't need them. Those with good imaginations can easily picture the world of Narnia and get a real feel for all the wonderful characters inside.

B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Although there are only 3 language options stated on the jacket. The Blu-ray version actually has 10+ language options available. I have been buying a Chinese version of Lost for the past 3 seasons for my father to fully enjoy the plot. It's a great thing that ABC is willing to put additional tracks so everyone can enjoy a great show like Lost. Even the commentaries are translated!    I hope all blu-ray movies will do the same for now on. It's a great incentive for us to buy blu-ray addition to HD quality picture and sound.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Slick looking action flicks with hyper fast camera work, slo-mo fx, cool soundtracks and a brainlessness that even dimwits can acknowledge and overlook are a dime a dozen, and there isn't much to get too excited about here. There are some really cool action sequences, but anymore for me, sitting through the nauseatingly insipid story with plot holes the size of Kansas takes extreme effort anymore. Hey, maybe they should skip a story altogether and just throw together the cool action sequences, yea! On a side note as the movie starts, I instantly wondered to myself if that Shia LeBouf guy from Disturbia and Indiana Jones was offered this role...the hyper emotional angst shtick he does is this character to a tee. Anyway, I was a bit surprised at the heavyweight cast, given the absurdity of the story, maybe they all saw the potential $$ that these eye candy movies can produce. Worth a look for some of the action sequences.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Whether this series is close to real life and the truth or not is irrelevant, and I wouldn't know anyway.     What this show is, is well made, funny and fantastic, high quality material that remains close to its source material whilst not being afraid to find the story, and the \\"good television\\" within it.     The creators throw their audience into the deep end, with a tonne of jargon and army uniforms that, at the beginning, make it difficult to tell characters apart, but overall this adds to the effect that we are seeing this military world through a civilian's eyes. By way of this, I found it gratifying to be treated as an intelligent audience by the shows makers.    The cast is fantastic, and there are some truly GREAT performances, particularly from Alexander Skarsgard (now seen on HBO's True Blood). Just a warning to those fainthearted out there, the language is pretty crude, and very heavily used, and some of the (very) dark humour could be offensive to some. I found that it gave me a deeper understanding of the characters and how they deal with the environment around them...    In all, this is an engrossing and entertaining mini series that is beautifully made and a lot of fun to watch.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|First of all, the DVD 1 (MOVIE) is absolutely great!  The movie is even better after you watch it again and again.  HOWEVER, the DVD 2 (FEATURES) is absolutely horrid.  The best part of the extras/features is the IMAX scenes!!  And that is absolutely it.  Nothing else to look forward to if buying.  I understand they choose not to use a lot, if any, behind the scenes video of Heath but come on.  Fans of TDK deserve to see ALL behind the scenes footage including any/all of Heath Ledger.  Would have loved to have more 'behind-the-scenes' stuff of Bale and Ledger in action with one another from the interrogation scene.  Now that would have been worth buying the special edition set by itself.  Hope this helps others.  Thanks, Dustin Wells.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|(This review is strictly about the Blu-Ray quality and content, not about the movie itself.)    After watching The Dark Knight in glorious blu-ray last night, I can say for sure it is the best title to come out on the format to date. The visual quality of the movie will make your head spin!     The three disc set consists of the movie:    DISC ONE: The Movie. On this disc are focus points, which are shorter behind-the scenes look at the creation of a particular action scene. If turned on, the focus point will play when the scene in the movie comes up. It is reminiscent of the \\"infinifilm\\" on DVDs.    DISC TWO: Special Features. Self explanatory... just packed with more interviews and behind the scenes looks. Includes every trailer of Dark Knight in HD, including many other HD features. Looks good!    DISC THREE: Digital Copy. Very handy if you enjoy putting the movie on your computer at no extra cost. The protected .mp4 file is 1.67 GB can be copied to itunes when the disc is placed into a PC or Mac. Great for ipods!    The Dark Knight will convince any skeptic of Blu-ray that they should take a closer look.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|So Batman is back? and this time \\"The Dark Knight\\", has more shadow, more danger, is more menacing etc etc?<br />One can be forgiven for asking these things amidst the morass of versions of the popular comic book hero over the years, but particularly since Tim Burton's visionary remake back in 1989 with Michael Keaton, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.<br />Now unless you've been living in a cave somewhere, you will no doubt have caught some of the hype surrounding the movie, particularly Heath Ledger's performance as the psychotic perennial smile wearing criminal, so bittersweet after his untimely death.<br />Chris Nolan makes a valiant effort here in his follow up to Batman Begins staying with the same characters, building on them, and continuing the \\"darker\\" side of Bruce Wayne's crime fighting alter ego. With the exception of a few, the same actors also reprise their roles from the last picture, with the main exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, who is easily as beguiling as Katie Holmes last time in the same role.<br />The movie is fast paced, with some necessary pauses for dramatic buildup but moves fairly steadily over the almost 2½ hour run time, the gadgets get a little better but still remain vaguely believable as do Batman's abilities, in fact this time we actually see a few chinks in the armor.<br />The support cast are excellent, particularly Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, and Bale is suitably beefed but suave and almost arrogant as our hero. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face is a nice distraction, but his place in the movie could arguably been trimmed or even sidelined for the next movie, and ultimately makes this picture unnecessarily overfilled with diverging storylines.<br />But make no mistake, the movie belongs to Ledger, and at times it seems that every one else is simply along for the ride. Within the storyline you find yourself suspending disbelief quite readily as The Joker goes on his one man demolition job, without conscience or care, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.<br />It's difficult not to compare Nicholson and Ledgers performances side by side, but on close scrutiny where the former had some of the quirky likeability and almost lovable psychosis (reminiscent even of Cesar Romero in the camp TV show), Ledger is firmly grounded and oozes malevolence, when you laugh, it's usually nervous laughter as the character is dangerously unpredictable.<br />On the positive side the movie has plenty of action, good CGI and bone crunching fight scenes and gadgets, which should please the most ardent fan of the movie genre. It also has enough depth to keep the more discerning viewers interest.<br />On the negative, too long, and I mean TOO long, nothing would have been lost had this movie been shaved by at least 25 minutes, and even moved to the next movie (for which I hear Bale is contracted to make). Testament to this is the fact that as the viewer you expect to have seen the end credits roll, on at least 4 occasions before they actually do. Also as mentioned earlier Nolan has tried to cram too many plotlines and individual character embellishments together and it gets a bit messy.<br />Those minor complaints aside, this IS a good movie, and worth seeing for Ledgers performance alone, a powerhouse performance of character acting that will I'm sure be a strong, but strange epitaph to a tragic loss of talent.or care, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.

B000BTJDGC|5.0|Jennifer Carpenter who became known to most of us via her characterization of Debra Morgan on the hit Showtime series Dexter, hits the ball out of the park as Emily Rose. Granted the movie doesn't allow us to see a whole lot of Emily as much of the script deals with the events surrounding her rather than focus on her specifically, but Ms. Carpenter's appearances on screen greatly impact the stories overall haunting atmosphere. Much has been written about her ability to contort her face and body to the point where the make-up and special effects departments could take a few days off during the shoot, but one has to see her performance to fully understand the depth of her abilities. The lack of vanity in her portrayal of Emily Rose is astounding. She does not act in this movie....she BECOMES Emily Rose. Moreover, for most of her on screen appearances in this movie, she becomes the demons which inhabited Emily's mind and body! No mean feat!    The cast of this movie are for the most part, veterans of the big screen and all contribute greatly to the movie's overall success. Erin Bruner, played by Laura Linney,actually becomes the main character in this movie, portraying a rising attorney who takes the case initially to make senior partner in her firm. She quickly becomes engrossed in the beliefs and motives of her client, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson)helped by certain supernatural occurrences in her own life. Although Father Moore is not privy to exactly what occurrences are taking place in Ms. Bruner's life, he warns her to watch out for spiritual attacks due to her involvement in the case. She is transformed from being a cynic to being less of a cynic to allowing for the possibility that things not seen with the naked eye might nevertheless exist. These new perspectives lead her to give one of the more brilliant closing statements in T.V./Movie history!     The supporting cast is stellar and Kenneth Welsh who plays Dr. Mueller is deserving of special mention. His frightened performance as the Dr. who discovers that being a witness to exorcism is no walk in the park, speaks to the audience, most of whom have never been to a real life exorcism, very directly. He states that if he had known, he never would have agreed to participate. It is obvious in the movie that he is not speaking to the subsequent trial but to the horrors that are now a part of his life. Having seen the dark forces, he can never be the person he was before his encounter.    This movie kept me entranced throughout and stuck with me even unto now. Judging from the articles I have since read online, many people were struck by this movie to the point of further investigation into the actual story upon which the movie was based. Movies that stick with you beyond the closing credits are rare these days. This one will haunt you. Believe it!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I ordered this from sn distribution which stated it had a new DVD \\"IN STOCK\\" and the day after I ordered it I received an email stating the order was cancelled.  I found someone else to order from but was very disappointed and angry that the advertisement stated in stock when it wasn't.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I enjoyed this movie but the hype and over-promotion that has followed has been quite silly. TDK wasn't even the best comic based film of the year. Yet, some people are calling it the greatest movie ever. Get real. The good news is that all the zealous hype about Heath Ledger's performance is true. He's simply great as the Joker. Every single scene Ledger is in sings. Unfortunately, some of the non-Joker scenes feature a lot of what failed in prior Batman films.  The film suffers on a few fronts. One, there is little emotional connection between any of the characters (especially the limp love triangle emotional misfire). Two, the thirty minutes or so of the Two-Face revenge stuff just sap the energy gained by Ledger's Joker and screams \\"overkill\\" to me. Don't get me wrong, I consider it an enjoyable, dark movie that deserves a spot among anyone's top five comic adaptation lists. There are flaws in logic literally from the one minute mark through the entire running time but they don't really get in the way of the plot or the enjoyment of this film. It's captivating and keeps your attention all the way through even though it lags at the Two-Face juncture.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Just a short important piece of information regarding the Closed Captioning feature for \\"Band of Brothers\\" - its there folks. Just go to your TV's menu and turn on the CC1 feature and you're in business! You will get both normal sound plus the closed captioning. Nice. Now everyone can better enjoy this superb series.<br /><br />My favorite section is on disc six where the actual WWII vets talk about their experiences. Nothing beats listening to the guys who were there tell their stories. An important part of American history is preserved forever. It was an honor to watch such a fine presentation. Thank you.
B000LT2IHI|2.0|I was really excited to receive this toy for my 9 month old as an early Christmas present from my cousin. She said it would aid my baby to learn how to stand. However, this can be a dangerous toy if you leave the child unattended. My baby boy tried to stand by pulling from the giraffe's ears and he felt on his back and hitting his head. The whole giraffe was on top of him. He was crying like crazy and very scared. I took the toy out of his room for the moment to see if it is more appropriate when he grows older. He doesn't seem to be interested in the toy anyway. Sometimes the balls get stuck in the mouth of the giraffe and it only plays one silly sound.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|A friend of mine gave me a CD a while back he said I might like.  \\"The '59 Sound\\" by the Gaslight Anthem, it was called.  My friend is more into pop/punk, but some of his musical reccommendations have been helpful in the past: he once suggested a singer he'd heard a little from, Tom Waits; I have since become a Waits fanatic, and have even made my friend a bigger fan that he'd previously been.  So when he gave me an album he described as \\"Bruce Springsteen meets punk,\\" I took notice (people who don't even know my last name know I am a Springsteen nut).  Still, I put off listening.<br /><br />Well, I finally caved.  And, let me tell you: I wish I had listened to the album when I first got it.  It's true, a lot of what's here is pretty retro: Brian Fallon and company pretty much borrow directly from the catalogues of Springsteen and Petty, with a little 50s/60s rock thrown in for good measure.  The thing is, they combine it all with a punk undertone; the result is a wonderful sonic mixture, fueled by strong lyrics, vocals, and musicianship.  The result is something that seems intimately familiar, but enticingly new at the same time.  It's rock 'n roll that's been worn in and faded out--which makes it fit all the better.  This is rock 'n roll for those who appreciate real rock 'n roll: no divides between \\"classic rock\\" and \\"punk\\" and \\"metal.\\"  Rock is still rock; and the Gaslight Anthem stands as a damn good reminder that all that counts is a great song, a great lyric, and one hell of a groove.  A few Boss references don't hurt none, either.
B00000I14Z|5.0|A while back, I picked up [[ASIN:B0000060Q9 Pithecanthropus Erectus: 1955-1957]] as my first dose of Mingus. While I was favorably impressed for the most part, I really didn't see what all the excitement over Charles Mingus was about. But after listening to Ah Um maybe twenty times over a three or four week period, I can safely say I've seen the light. This is one of the most intricate, interesting, brilliantly executed CD's in my burgeoning collection. The backing band is diverse and totally into what Mingus was trying to accomplish. They follow the lead of the driving, swinging rhythm set down by Mingus and capitalize on every opportunity to shine when given a solo. Because all the songs were written by Mingus, the song selection is not exactly mainstream, but I think most jazz enthusiasts will be familiar with a few of these songs. This production quality is very high, the liner notes informative and generous. Total music is almost 73 minutes, and they don't waste a single minute. Because this gets away from the \\"standard\\" standards, this is a good change of pace, but it is quintessential jazz and unmistakable  Mingus. I have to give it five stars, because this CD is \\"the max\\".
B000V8I2QU|1.0|This is the worst sounding Springsteen cd ever. It is really hard to listen to. The vocals are buried deep in the muddy mix. I heard most of these songs played with the E-Street Band on the Magic tour and they sounded so much better. I don't hear the E-street band on this cd.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I rate Beowulf at four stars overall. I purchased Beowulf for under $5.00 as a pre-screened DVD, and started out a complete innocent. I had never seen coming attractions, and was totally unaware of anything about this film. In fact, I purchased the movie ignorant of the ambitious computer graphics effort and totally judged this book by its fine realistic looking DVD cover.<br /><br />I was not too surprised, however, to learn by watching this DVD that Beowulf was an all CGI affair. Then I suddenly noticed a main character that looked just like Anthony Hopkins (my favorite actor) as well as other characters that looked very familiar. Once the unmistakably beautiful Angelina Jolie appeared, I realized something was going on that might be important to the future of cinema.<br /><br />This film was a fairly successful effort to produce a movie in which the animated screen appearance of many characters was based on the actual actor. I at first thought that it represented the first efforts to produce a computer animated film without the use of actors, but only their images and voices.<br /><br />After watching the informative documentary on the making of the film I learned that the actual actors were vital and motion capture techniques (e.g., latest remake of King Kong) were used to produce these very realistic images. Although this falls far short of a time which will permit films to made by CGI which do not require actors to perform for any single role, Beowulf did not require set designers to actually build full scale sets or be limited to what could be actually be constructed.<br /><br />Actors who wish to participate in such future productions will permit detailed laser scanned 3D computer maps to be made of their faces and entire body and stored in data bases which will include: generic motion capture recordings including eye motions, the unique body language of a particular actor (I noticed Anthony Hopkin's body language before his face), as well as voice spectrographs for speech. Once high speed computer algorithms and CGI effects evolve sufficiently, these celebrity actors (or their estates after their death) could simply be paid a cost effective royalty for their franchise and reserve more of their valuable time for actual performances during special film productions or theater.<br /><br />In this way we will be able to see our favorite actors continue their screen appearances during their entire life and well after their death (if market rules permit), and once CGI computer techniques become cheap enough, increase the number of productions that celebrities can appear in for a small fraction of the normal production cost.peed computer algorithms and CGI effects evolve sufficiently, these celebrity actors (or their estates after their death) could simply be paid a cost effective royalty for their franchise and reserve more of their valuable time for actual performances during special film productions or theater.

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|I completely disliked this movie. I can't believe it manage to be the second highest grossing movie of all time. Warner Bros really lucked out when Heath Ledger died. I am not trying to speak ill of the dead but let's be honest Warner Bros is probably thinking the same thing. Christian Bale is the worst Batman ever. Heath Ledger was okay but too dark for my tastes.  I personally will always prefer Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I can't believe they replaced Katie Holmes!! Why didn't they just do what they always do when a actor decides not to come back and say she died sometime after Batman Begins or she got a job 1000 Miles away or something. I hate when they replace characters and act like it is no big deal. IT IS A BIG DEAL!! The storyline was all over the place. Things were included that could have been left on the cutting room floor, like the part at the beginning with the Scarecrow. I probably not be so utterly peeved about this movie if it had not been a waste of TWO AND A HALF HOURS. This movie had plenty of scenes they could have lived without. So for everyone who wanders where the Deleted Scenes are for this DVD, they didn't leave anything on the cutting room floor, it all went in to this LONG movie. They didn't want to leave out one scene of the Joker, again to capitalize on this young man's unfortunate death. We all know there will be another Batman movie, I hope they do what they have decided to do with the Superman Franchise. Scrap everything they have built in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Get them some new actors, and a decent writer (Will Bryan Singer please stand up) and start anew. I am just glad I did not buy this movie, I strictly rented it.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|Although not my favorite ATDI album, this is the first one I ever heard.  The intensity of Cedric's vocals can be grating at times, but these guys are amazingly tight considering the punk quality of the music.  Find some live footage of them on the web.  So sloppy yet so inspiring.  Better than the Mars Volta, better than Sparta, ATDI was the one-night stand you never saw again (but won't ever forget).    1) Arcarsenal - My favorite tune kicks off the album.  Don't f with ATDI.  Cedric's just shouting his head off.  Vampires?  Cannibals?  Like most of their songs, I have no idea.    2) Pattern Against User - A fan fave, but I could do without.  It's got some bounce to it, but after the wake of destruction left by the previous song, this just peeters along.  3) One Armed Scissor - I know, I'm supposed to like this one too, but it's unfortunately not what I'm looking for.  It's not dynamic enough for me.  There are better songs elsewhere.  4) Sleepwalk Capsules - Just blasting out of the gates into the top 3, this one's purely to melt your face.  Great chorus and a tight, tight breakdown.  \\"Pacifier pacifies.\\"    5) Invalid Litter Dept. - The longest track is about famous murders near the band's hometown.  Another great chorus, but not much else.  Until...BAM!  2 songs in 1!  And it rrrocks!!!  6) Mannequin Republic - These guys don't let up.  Maybe the hardest rocker here.  \\"They call it a wasteland, baby!!\\"  I'm screaming the ending every time.  7) Enfilade - Creepy phone call from Iggy Pop to start, 2nd best song to follow.  The drums sound like electric garbage cans.  The freight-train's comin' and it makes me wanna dance.     8) Rolodex Propaganda - OMG, just terrible.  Iggy picked a horrible song to appear on.  When he warbles \\"Manuscript replica\\" I just laugh.  Goofy effects to boot.    9) Quarantined -  A slower song.  The bass intro sounds like Rage, but the chorus shout-along is all Drive-In.  The bridge really trips me out.  A little long, but a strong track.  10) Cosmonaut - Cedric's vocals are a little much for me on this one.  Not the worst, but by this time in the album it's getting hard to concentrate.  kk-kk-kk-kk kow!!  11) Non Zero Possibility - So I've usually moved on to something else by this point, saving myself from this song.  Bow down to the emo gods.  Sorry, no good.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Despite my understanding of anyone who claims to dislike ABBA and their songs, and I include myself here, I DEFY anyone, including the Queen and the Pope and even terrorists with their sour pusses, not to come away singing one of the tunes from this movie.  Try as I might, after hearing 'Dancing Queen' with its painful and poorly constructed lyrics, I find myself singing it for at least two weeks after!  ABBA songs are potent!!!  Be warned!
B001GQACGO|1.0|I was a Beyonce fan with Dangerously in Love and after BDay I started to become leery of who she was becoming and I thank God I listened to the CD from a co-worker b4 I opened it because I was/is very disappointed in it.  She definately lost a fan with that crap she calls an album.  I miss the old BEYONCE, Sasha Fierce needs to go back into hibernation...this album is a mess....
0151013837|1.0|Life of Pi is a deeply wonderful story, but I was very disappointed in these illustrations--the colors are vivid but the illustrations don't add anything to the experience of Pi's story.  I was really excited when I saw the fine cover illustration of the tiger, but aside from that one and the illustration of Orange Juice floating atop the bananas, they were lifeless and lacked a spark.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|The new Journey to the Center of the Earth has beautiful scenery but not a whole lot else to recommend it.  The current version is not a remake of the 1959 movie starring James Mason.  This is unfortunate because, in my opinion, it would have been a much better film if it had been more faithful to that version (the plot would have been better, to say the least).  The current film stars Brendan Fraser as a geology professor who ventures down a volcanic tube, with his nephew in tow, and an Icelandic beauty as a sidekick.  They are in search of Fraser's lost brother. The plot is totally predictable.  There are few if any surprises in store for the viewer. The acting is adequate and the actors themselves are pleasant to look at. Unfortunately, the cast also includes a most annoying animated bluebird who tails the party for most of their underground adventure.  Children under ten might enjoy this movie.  I do not think an adult would think it worth the price to buy or even rent the DVD.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|While Paul's first LP 'McCartney' established him as an individual apart from the Beatles, the rest of his post-Beatle music always seemed like he was trying to recapture that Beatles Pop sound -- with mixed success. ELECTRIC ARGUMENTS has Paul looking ahead instead of behind. He has clearly found his \\"voice\\" on this venture and the result is astounding. It's somewhat like an EVOLUTION of the Beatles' sound and not just a rehash of a proven formula. It's also an evolutionary step for Paul and his music. He's always been held to the Beatle standard and now he actually raises the bar. For many fans, ELECTRIC ARGUMENTS is the McCartney album they always knew he could make -- but never did. That's changed. Very possibly, this is the best Paul CD/LP since Sgt. Pepper.<br />It's that good!<br /><br />The producer, Youth, shares in the credits here. This is tricky stuff. In unskilled hands it could have been a flushing disaster. As it stands, Youth and Paul are at the pinnacle of their art with an abundance of sonic nuance layered over minimalist ideas. (Is \\"complex minimalism\\" an<br />oxy-moron?) Anyhow, two master weavers have sown together a beautiful sound tapestry. That may be a bit clich&eacute; but it's true none-the-less. Youth grabs the concept and nails it to the wall.<br /><br />The songs are basic Paul but the presentation is anything but basic. In the past, Paul's done some great stuff with dumb lyrics as well as some dumb stuff with great lyrics. With few exceptions, Paul has never been able to wander off the middle-of-the-road without falling into the ditch on either side. Paul would fail when he tried to rock TOO hard and also fail if he would wallow the other way into new age trance. With this CD, Paul blows that theory off the map. In the end it's always the arrangement that wins over your ears and heart. Here he arranges his voice more as an instrument than just a delivery van for his lyrics. Youth blends all the elements together in an intoxicating cocktail for the ears. Most of the songs have great intro and outro as well. There's a<br />consistency of a total package here that invites being opened again and again.<br />===============================================================<br />1. Nothing Too Much Just Out Of Sight: The title sums it up pretty well. A nice ride with no destination. Possibly the weakest song on the CD, but giving a hint of better things to come.<br /><br />2. Two Magpies: Very spontaneous, \\"living room\\" atmosphere. His laid back vocal fits well.<br /><br />3. Sing The Changes: The kind of song that would get U2 a Grammy. Perfect.<br /><br />4. Traveling Light: A mystical sojourn. Some old Donovan-style magic at work here.<br /><br />5. Highway: Like being in the fast lane with Beck at the wheel.<br /><br />6. Light From Your Lighthouse: Again, perfect! Imagine Tom Waits singing with A3.<br /><br />7. Sun Is Shining: Another sunshine song and a real delight. Is that a \\"na na na na na\\" nod to Paul Simon? Who cares? It works.<br /><br />8. Dance 'Til We're High: Yes, it's another pop song but again done to perfection. This could compete with any tapes in Phil Spector's wall of sound archives.<br /><br />9. Lifelong Passion: It's a relic, it's sooooo psychedelic. Nice to know that George's influence still lingers.<br /><br />10. Is This Love?: Shows us that Paul has mastered trance. Think Brian Eno and Popol Vuh.<br /><br />11. Lovers In A Dream: More trance but in the style of 'Riders on the Storm' by the Doors.<br /><br />12. Universal Here, Everlasting Now: John Cage meets Mike Oldfield and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />13. Don't Stop Running: A great song to end the CD, then two minutes of silence and a fabulous kicker.<br /><br />  \\"That's basically it.\\"<br />==========================================================<br />MADER Method of rating: (scale of 1 to 5 for each element for a total of 25 possible)<br /><br />M: Material (composer) 4<br />A: Arrangement (performer/producer) 5<br />D: Delivery (artist/group) 5<br />E: Energy/Vibes/Spirit (artist/group/team) 5<br />R: Recording Quality (engineer) 5<br />==========================================================<br />24/25  96%  5 stars!ent (performer/producer) 5<br />D: Delivery (artist/group) 5<br />E: Energy/Vibes/Spirit (artist/group/team) 5<br />R: Recording Quality (engineer) 5<br />==========================================================<br />24/25  96%  5 stars!

B001HXG8PK|4.0|The music:<br />Good. Epic in its build and momentum. Inspires the mind to conjure the visuals from the film.<br /><br />The track listing:<br />Evil. Why why why would you release THE ENTIRE SCORE OUT OF ORDER?!?!?<br /><br />The packaging:<br />Good. The pictures and quality of the paper are excellent. The thickness of the binding material is hardy. The slipcase is unique and pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />The rubber stoppers:<br />Evil. Why why why would you not provide this important information that a previous poster provided:<br /><br />DO NOT force the discs to fit over the silicon stoppers. Remove the silicon first, they peel off, lay the discs in and then place the silicon stoppers over the top of the discs hole. The silicon will hold the discs in place. They should have included instructions because so many people will try to force them and ruin the discs. I had the same problem on my Planet of the Apes bluray set.<br /><br />Overall, its good, but underneath is something evil that simply needed a push to be better. Unfortunately, the push never happened. Still good though.

B000MRAAJW|3.0|This is a big production with some incredible cinematography that is truly second to none. However, as an avid collector of nature films, I somehow was a bit disappointed by the lack of totally new material that I have never seen before.<br /><br />One scene demonstrated the emergence of periodical cicadas in the southeastern United States, and the ensuing feast enjoyed by all the predatory birds, reptiles, etc. This was very spectacular, but I was troubled by the narrator's assertion that this event occurs only once every 17 years. While the cicada actually does live for 17 years as an underground nymph before emerging for its brief adult life, I am quite sure that there are multiple broods of different ages occurring in a given area which allow for a new emergence every few years. Why was this point not researched a little more thoroughly?<br /><br />In summary, I was very impressed by the quality of this production but slightly disappointed by the lack of new content not already explored by other, similar documentaries.

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie for those that have an imagination.  Some aspects of this movie are not meant to be taken literally.  They are merely to be viewed as interesting and cool ideas.  Other than that, the movie is completely action packed.  The actors are great in it and who does not like to watch Angelina Jo Lee on screen anyway?  Great movie!
B001GQACGO|4.0|There were only a few songs i actually loved and wanted to listen to more on Bday and honestly when i first heard this album, it sounded just \\"alright\\" but please if you're writing a review and you've only heard this album once, you really have to give it a few listens before you judge. Yes, the \\"sasha fierce\\" side is the same old Beyonce but hey it's good music and thats whats she does best! and the \\"I am\\" side is the side that really caught me off guard the second time i heard it. I was like \\"how did i not notice how beautiful these songs are the 1st time?\\". Literally every song is great on the \\"I am\\" side, i appreciate her trying new things and new sounds, as much as i love her R&B sound like in the destinys child days (i loved destiny fulfilled) this shows a more mature grown up sound and i understand now what she meant when she said she took risks on this album. But I loved the outcome! Don't understand why its getting just o.k. reviews, cmon people it's definitely better than Bday!
B00168OINK|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've seen in the last year, at least.  (Somehow I just can't get the scene with the turtle and the candles out of my head... you'll know the one.)  This film achieves epic levels of animation with facial expressions and movements that are funny in their own right, plus A+ level voice acting from top notch actors.<br /><br />I've cut down on my movie purchases a lot lately, realizing that a \\"DVD collection\\" is probably a really poor investment in every sense, but this one is a keeper.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the extras on the DVD, particularly the interview with all of the voice actors represented.<br /><br />That said, I would not have paid the original price for this DVD.  It's just one movie.  The extras are good but short.  My DVD player does not seem happy with the games (they run choppy to the extent that they're unplayable) but then, does anyone really want to play games on their DVD player anyway?  It was the price reduction that brought this film back down to the land of the sane.  Great movie + fair price = sold.
159102594X|2.0|The biggest fault I had with this book was that it took almost the entire 500+ pages to truly (I think) start the story.  The rest is about the meanderings (well ok, battle filled meanderings) of characters from a wide variety of areas.  Probably the best comparison I can make is with \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" by Tolkien.  Both books involve a quest that is a major turning point in the characters' lives and the world (I assume so anyhow for \\"The First Law\\" series, not having read the latter two books).  But whereas \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" places the start of the quest relatively early but after a buildup which makes the necessity and gravity of the quest apparent, \\"The Blade Itself\\" waits til the end and the quest appears to come out of nowhere with no indication as to why it's important.    The rest of the book comes across as a weak \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" clone, with sections focusing on different characters from different political entities but none of these sections really grabbed me or made me care about what might happen to the characters.  One is a bitter, crippled torturer.  One is a pampered, spoiled, lovesick noble.  One is a barbarian well known for his abilities in battle (I'll admit, this character did provide a rather well done plot twist at one point).  One is a wizard who has an ulterior motive.  Etc... The different political factions fight against each other, but I rarely got a sense as to why certain things were done.  Battle scenes were thrown in pretty much at any opportunity.  One of the characters is training for a contest, and those scenes seem nothing more than some medieval version of \\"Rocky\\".    The upshot is that for me, this novel was a slow read, punctuated by somewhat random (if reasonably well written) battle sequences, peopled by characters I couldn't empathize with, in a world with somewhat simplistic connections between the different factions, and left me just as confused as to where things were going at the end than at the beginning.    To be clear, I don't need to be hand-held when reading.  I don't mind a bit of mystery, or surprising changes of direction.  But for a change of direction to be surprising, there has to have been another solid seeming direction beforehand, and I never got this impression when reading.      I also didn't feel like I'd wasted my time after reading it, but it failed at its task of getting me interested enough to buy the next novel.
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|I usually LOVE 2 disc special editions.  Typically, they have deleted or extended scenes, director commentary, and interviews with the actors.<br /><br />This has NONE of those!  The 2nd disc is a waste!  No actor interviews, no commentary...all it has is a silly interview with the composer, and some fake \\"Gothom Tonight\\" shows.<br /><br />Seriously, Heath Ledger gives one of the best villain performances of all times, and there isnt one interview?!?!?  Nothing at all.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The trick Warner Bros. manages to pull off with this DVD release is to give me as little content as they can possibly get away with and still call this a \\"special edition,\\" and yet still make me feel as if I got my money's worth as a consumer.  This has literally never happened to me before.  I've written a number of reviews decrying the rampant Hollywood custom of the ol' special-edition \\"bait-n-switch\\": 1 disc's worth of content spread over two, key features missing, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />There's plenty missing here.  Director's commentary.  Cast interviews.  A memorial of some kind to Heath Ledger.  A movie this epic in scale obviously has much more to it than what is presented here, which means that another even more super special ultra deluxe edition is just waiting to be released sometime far enough into the future that many of us will probably find some thin reason to justify its purchase.  Ordinarily I would be livid about this, but several things mollify me enough to instead sit back and appreciate the product I now have for exactly what it's worth.<br /><br />The first thing is that I always felt this film would be even better if it was rated R.  When another edition is released, I am holding out hope that it will be unrated, and that we'll be privy to the more grisly elements of The Joker's crimes.  For instance, what happened to William Fichtner's gun-toting bank executive after The Joker drove away?  Is it possible that would have been our first glimpse of his infamous \\"Joker venom\\" had the effects not been too ghastly for a rating of PG-13?<br /><br />Second, this was the best movie of 2008 and one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, period.  I didn't buy it for the extras.  I saw it three times in theaters, twice on opening weekend and once on IMAX.  And in the 36 or so hours since I've owned my copy, I've watched it another 3 times.<br /><br />Third, the extras that ARE present are good enough to distract you from what is NOT.  There's an excellent mini-feature on the creation of The Joker's signature two-note theme (Even knowing that it's an electric cello doesn't remove the tension and anxiety that one sound creates in your spine when you hear it.) and another on how they constructed the Bat-pod and the suit.  The latter feature drew my attention to the fact that this is the first Batman movie I've seen where the suit looked like something a man could actually create for himself (with the right resources) and not just some movie costume.  Every extra has captions, which is a huge deal for me because I've so rarely seen film companies have the foresight to add captions to the special features.<br /><br />There are trailers!  For a trailer junkie like myself, this is a big deal.  The trailers for this movie were terrific, and it's nice to finally see a studio include a great trailer with a great movie.  They even throw in that phenomenal \\"Watchmen\\" teaser, but unfortunately you can't access it directly; you have to just put the DVD in and let it play before the menu comes on.  There are IMAX-formatted clips of the movie.  They are nice to look at, but the effect is, needless to say, somewhat diminished when you're not watching on a 60-foot screen.<br /><br />And the bestest most hilariously insightfully imaginative wonderful extra of all is the collection of \\"Gotham Tonight\\" clips.  The fictional show we caught snippets of during the film takes us in real time from the events of Batman Begins to the events of this movie, creating an entire world in the space of forty minutes thanks to savvy writing and some fantastic acting.  Anthony Michael Hall fleshes out his role as the Anderson Cooper-esque reporter Mike Engel, and spends four \\"episodes\\" interviewing his fellow cast members and commentating on the action.  Seeing so much of him makes it personal and wrenching when he winds up becoming one of The Joker's unwilling victims.  Everyone is in character and the scenes are obviously not improvised, so I can only assume that the Nolan brothers wrote these little vignettes too.  (Great lines include: \\"A man with six fingers is strange, Mike.  This is alarming.\\")  You don't have to be a news junkie -- or even a FAKE news junkie -- to get a kick out of these pieces, but it sure helps.  Everything about them feels authentic, from the scrolling headlines at the bottom of the screen to the cheesy music and the angry pundits.  If you pay attention to every detail, a lot of things are revealed or clarified about the Gotham City that was reinvented for the relaunch of this franchise.  For instance, Alfred is Bruce's legal guardian and at one point, he actually had Bruce declared dead.  Some of what we learn is silly (One of Dent's supporters is working on a musical about his life called \\"The White Knight\\"!) but it also inspires sobering thoughts.  Mike is a harsh critic of Batman, and points out in one interview that Batman could likely be the cause of the escalating violence, as criminals react to him and/or try to top him.  The idea that Batman may be causing the harm he's sworn to put an end to is a very dark thought indeed.<br /><br />Even the packaging on this set won me over.  Most special-editions I've purchased senselessly kill trees with a glossy cardboard slipcover that is EXACTLY THE SAME as the plastic cover underneath it.  Someone at Warner Bros. decided to shake that up a bit.  Compare your two covers when you buy the disc and see for yourself.  It's just nice to know that the $995 million they made off this movie hasn't gone completely to waste.  Plus there's a digital copy of the film so that you can watch it on your iPod at no extra charge, and if you buy it here at Amazon for a limited time they'll lease you the right to watch it on this website for like 6 months, for free.  I don't really see the point of that offer, but whatever -- it's something for \\"free\\" so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />I'm not complaining about anything related to this movie these days, which is why I've granted a perfect score to an imperfect package for the first time ever.  My only complaints will be if the Oscars don't rightfully recognize this come nomination day.  In fact, there's a thought -- think of this release as your own personal Academy Award screening copy.  It has everything you need to know so that you can nominate it for Best Score, Visual and sound effects, and costumes.  As for the rest of the categories -- well, the movie speaks for itself.  And it speaks loudly enough to cover up any shouting about how disappointing this DVD is.

B001CJJWV6|5.0|For those of you concerned about the HD picture not being widescreen, please note that the film was originally shot with the full intentions to be televised so it was framed essentially 4:3 (unfortunately there is no more to this picture then what you see).  While 99% of most HD content will be 16:9 widescreen or wider, it is absolutely not essential that HD must be widescreen - nor is it a law or another other type of sac religious excuse someone wants to come up with.  If the picture was to be made into 16:9, it would have needed to be zoomed-into or cropped on the top and bottom and then you would have complained about how could anyone crop Jimi Hendrix.  This film was transferred into the highest possible definition available utilizing the full aspect of the screen that it was originally shot in.  Be thankful that a film this old was remotely preserved over 40 years to be able to be transferred to HD and quite frankly, look this amazing.  If you want to see this full-screen on your widescreen monitor, then as another reviewer said he did, just zoom in, but most people don't want to see Jimi looking 40 pounds over weight or his head, or worst yet guitar, cropped off.

0316017922|3.0|I read and enjoyed Gladwell's earlier books (THE TIPPING POINT and BLINK), then passed them on to friends. As enjoyable as these books were, I knew I wasn't likely to want to re-read either of them. So when OUTLIERS came out (to mixed reviews), I decided to buy it in the Kindle version (It's cheaper and no trees were required to give their lives for my reading experience.)<br /><br />As with Gladwell's earlier books, the subject is something everyone wonders about (in this case, What makes one person so much more successful than another with approximately equal skills and qualifications?), but no one has taken the time to examine. Gladwell's writing is so breezy and engaging that it is easy to accept his arguments and conclusions. While I agree with most of what he says, I suspect almost every key point could be disputed by someone willing to invest the time and energy. Some of his assertions: the month of a person's birth can affect a Canadian's success in professional hockey; years of birth determined who would become the frontrunners in the computer world; 10,000 hours is the point at which a person achieves mastery of any skill; deference to authority can be deadly in the airline business; and the Asian work ethic is based on the high level of attention and care needed to grow rice (as opposed to the less demanding needs of wheat and barley that were the staples of European agriculture). You might quibble with Gladwell on any of these points, but if you read the book you'll likely find yourself seduced by his presentation. And if nothing else, he helps to disabuse us (Americans, anyway) of the notion of the \\"self-made man/woman.\\" The \\"accident\\" of birth (where and when) and other circumstances beyond one's personal control can have as much to do with a person's success as any innate abilities. And as the Beatles (one of the subjects of this book) said, \\"Ooo, I get by with a little help from my friends.\\" In the end, being the best at anything isn't as important as being good enough, alert to opportunity, and putting in your 10,000 hours.<br /><br />Kindle users be warned, not every chart in the book displays in a readable way on the Kindle device (not even when the smallest type size is selected.) You may have to look at the charts in a bookstore to make sense of them. Fortunately, the book doesn't have that many charts.good enough, alert to opportunity, and putting in your 10,000 hours.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is honestly the most entertaining and heart filled piece that Pixar has done to date, with not only laughter and adventure but also romantic elements that actually WORK!    Now, I'll admit that I loved Toy Story, but before this that was Pixar's high point. Movies like Cars even fell back on bad cliches and gender stereotypes, but with Wall-E comes EVE who is a powerfull female (Yes I know she's a robot but the female symbolism is obvious) figure and an actual driving force in the plot. For once we have a female who's more than a mere accessory to her male counterpart, she has a personality all her own! Let's hope Pixar keeps this up and we don't see any more \\"little Bo Peep\\" type women from their features anymore!    The soundtrack is great and original, falling back more on classics than new songs. It works and works well, adding to romantic moments or lonely ones.     Now the only downer is the humans, they're stupid, bumbling, and complacent. I wish the movie could've been made without them but there is some subtext about what makes humans human and what makes life worth living. So tolerate them, they're a necessary evil. XD    I encourage everyone to watch this with their children and be sure to use the morals embedded in the story as talking points to start a great conversation!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I went to see the dark knight thinking I was going to be let down.  After all with all the hype out there could any thing live up to it?  I was shocked at how perfict this movie was, for me the hype was to little.  I had to keep reminding my self that this was a comic book movie.  It had a great story that made you think and stayed with you.  Heath Ledger was 100% perfict as the joker, one of the best preforminces I have ever seen.  With the exaption of Maggie Gyllenhaal I thought the rest of cast was great.  On to the Blu-ray the picture and sound are top grade.  It could have used a commintary track but nothing is perfict.  The only thing I dont like is the aspact rato changes and is a little distracting.  This was the best batman movie I have ever seen and for me easly the best movie of the year.  It is very dark and at times scary so its not for all but if you can handle it its a must have.  R.I.P Heath Ledger thank you for your work.

0385338732|4.0|Remember Me? by Sophie Kinsella, author of the popular shopaholic series, is a fun fast read for the ladies. Kinsella describes the premise for the book...what if you woke up and didn't recognize your life? What if you lost three years of memory--and everything had changed in that time?  The novel follows Lexi, who at one moment is commiserating with her friends about her dead end job and loser boyfriend, then, after a fall down the stairs, wakes up with a life where she is married to a handsome man and is a ruthless manager making the big bucks. Much like the TV show Samantha Who, the story is very unbelievable, but the characters are great and the fun lies in Lexi's quest to figure out just how she got to where she is today.  Recommended for fans of Shopaholic, Emily Giffin, Janet Evanovich, and The Devil Wears Prada.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Consider Loreena McKennitt's latest album to be a natural expansion of her exquisite Yuletide EP, \\"A Winter Garden.\\"<br /><br />In fact, McKennitt includes four of those five songs on the sumptuously melancholy Christmas album \\"A Midwinter Night's Dream.\\" These medieval ballads and traditional carols are soaked in an ambience of nighttime woods, embroidered tapestries, wassail and Christmas mass in a shadowy cathedral. No syrupy shopping carols -- this is Christmas music from an earlier age.<br /><br />It opens with a swell of piano and quivering strings, as McKennitt murmurs, \\"The holly and the ivy/when they are full grown/of all the trees in the wood/the holly bears the crown... the rising of the sun/the running of the deer/the playing of the organ/sweet singing in the choir....\\"<br /><br />It's a suitable introduction to the album -- quiet, soft, and redolent with medieval Christianity alongside the forest's powerful vibrancy. And it quickly segues into the stately fiddle-riddled dance of \\"Un Flambeau Jeannette Isabelle,\\" the languid hymn \\"The Seven Rejoices Of Mary\\" and the swaying \\"Noël Nouvelet!\\"<br /><br />Then she heads into more familiar traditional fare -- the sprightly \\"Good King Wenceslas,\\" the gentle lullably \\"Coventry Carol\\" with its tale of King Herod's baby massacre, and staccato rhythms of \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\\" After that it's a mixture of well-known and more obscure -- a pair mellow haunting instrumentals, a bittersweet ballad a trembling string rendition of the traditional \\"Emmanuel,\\" and even a hearty wassailing song.<br /><br />Along with Sufjan Stevens' Christmas EPs, \\"A Midwinter Night's Dream\\" is one of the few Christmas albums that breaks the mold -- no \\"Jingle Bells,\\" no \\"Let It Snow,\\" no sentimental carols performed exactly the same as hundreds of other renditions. In other words, no painfully commercial carols meant for radioplay.<br /><br />Instead, McKennitt seems content to transport listeners back to tapestry-draped castles, dark nights filled with laughter and food, snowy forests and candelit stone churches. Her songs are crammed with stately sweet violins, plucked lute and some rhythmic little hand drums, as well as a sinuous flute that gives it a slightly Middle-Eastern flavor in \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\\"<br /><br />The crowning touch is McKennitt's strong, sweetly rich voice, which always sounds like she's restraining herself from REALLY blowing you away. Her voice slips easily into all the traditional carols, with their subjects ranging a saintly king's mission of mercy to Christina Rossetti's haunting poem of adoring the Christ child (\\"Cherubim and seraphim/Thronged the air/But his mother only/In her maiden bliss/Worshipped the Beloved/With a kiss...\\").<br /><br />\\"A Midwinter Night's Dream\\" is a haunting, richly realized Christmas album with a melancholy edge and truly exquisite traditional carols.

The Thirteenth Tale is a tasty treat for those who love to read about books and read about reading and so forth. I got lost in this wandering tale that stretches back and forth across time and in and out of books and old stories in relationship to a dying authoress with some juicy stuff to dish up before the wolf comes to the door.<br /><br />You'll be sad, happy and downright gleeful when reading this as it's a whirlwind of a story. It takes some flights of fancy but like I said, those will be forgiven.<br /><br />This is a Gothic tale of love, revenge, decaying old houses and magnificent gardens all with a nod to the likes of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and the like. Cozy up with some hot cocoa and enjoy the mystery.

0930289234|5.0|I'm an avid reader and have been buying books (not comics) from Amazon for years. Once I had such an awful experience with a very famous, award-winning and respected comic that it kept me away from them for years. The horrible comic was not 'Watchmen' of course.<br /><br />\\"Hmmm... It might be cool to see what the whole thing is about before the movie comes out\\" I thought after seeing the trailers and so ordered the book without any great expectations also because it had a very reasonable price... Boy, was I in for an awesome surprise!...<br /><br />'Watchmen' is simply amazing. For me it has been the rediscovery of comics as a completely different medium with its own potential for novel narrative structures. Visually it is stunning and the story is very complex and multi-layered. They have done stuff here with the narrative that would be impossible to do in literature. It really is something else.<br /><br />I was also surprised to find in 'Watchmen' many ideas that have been ripped-off (I know is a harsh thing to say but you can verify my claims for yourselves) by other popular pieces of entertainment like 'The Incredibles' or 'Heroes'.<br /><br />I love film and I wonder how Zack Snyder's take on the story will work. It's going to be very interesting to see.<br /><br />So, to wrap things up 'Watchmen' is visually awesome, its narrative is complex and engaging, it has a lot of action and romance and overall is very intellectually rewarding; and I insist: this is coming from somebody who is not into comics but books!<br /><br />[I won't leave you hanging so I'll tell what the other comic was, the very famous comic that I had to endure and was awful beyond belief, with the worst artwork I have ever seen in any medium and a crackpot story that made no sense at all... it's called 'Sandman', stay away from it, it's the complete opposite of 'Watchmen' in every way...]
0571229085|5.0|I bought this book in need of something that would not lead to heavy introspection or stressing over the state of the world.  What a wonderful, accidental choice it was!  Paul Aster launches into a tall tale full of unique, peculiar and sympathetic characters who attempt and achieve amazing things.  Told as a 1st-person narrative, the protagonist chronicles his life, starting in the 1920s as an 11-year-old guttersnipe in St. Louis who is approached by a man in a tuxedo and top-hat who promises that if the boy accompany him and submit to his instruction, he will be taught to fly by his 13ths birthday...if not, the man swears the boy may cut off his head with an axe!  Of course, nothing so horrid ever occurs...rather, the reader becomes wrapped up in the development of the characters, their evolving relationships, and the inspiring journey of the narrator.  His mentor (or \\"Master\\") promotes goodness and trueness but temptation, hurt and loss lead the protagonist astray, as his life continues to be an amazing adventure.    If you enjoyed the movie \\"Big Fish\\", I predict you will love this book and will be left, as you close the back cover, with a smile of satisfaction on your face!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is one of the top 10 albums from the past 20 years. Duffy showed true stage presence on SNL and her voice is unique. I find myself listening to this CD 3 and 4 times in a row, which I rarely ever do with any album. This does reflect the 60's and 70's sounds yet also comes off very modern sounding too. It's not an easy sound to define and the album is diverse. Her voice is so unique some are put off by it at first, but she really does have a great, original voice, the mark of a true genius. Her songs are just fantastic and show great maturity. This sounds like an album from someone in their mid thirties as far as the mature content of the lyrics. The album comes off as a concept album, following one person's journey from love lost and complicated, to some kind of personal, inner victory over self doubt and loneliness, a real rising above and picking yourself up kind of journey. In this way, she appealed to the Bruce Springsteen fan inside my soul. I'm ready for the next album. It's nice to see a beautiful, sexy lady on an album who is there because of her talent and not her looks. Duffy is a true inspiration, and since I am a musician and musical guru who always calls these things right, trust me, Duffy is a great singer and anyone claiming otherwise probably owns less than 75 cds. She also has her stage show down, which tells me she has soul. Keep being you, Duffy.

B000P12LWY|3.0|Perhaps the best thing I can say about the Tudors, having finished watching its first season, is that it is indeed very watchable and addictive. The production values are excellent and the sets and photography are gorgeous. The actors are almost uniformly good, though I sometimes feel that Rhys-Myers can be over-the-top and lacking in nuance. The characters are mostly involving and the drama mostly engrossing.    But there are some very serious problems with this show.     There's the sex. It is ubiquitous throughout the show. So much, in fact, that it becomes boring. It seems to me as if the writers were constantly amazed that people actually had sex back in the stuffy old 16th century. Oftentimes sex is employed as a convincing plot-driver; nevertheless, the seemingly interminable scenes soak up time and do very little in terms of character development.    And that's something often lacking in this show. There are a few characters- Henry, Cardinal Wolsey, Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn- who are very well developed indeed. But, it seems to me, the show overreaches and throws in a number of characters who seem to float amorphously between scenes, without giving the viewer any idea of who they are. These include Henry's sister (not based on any real person, as it turns out) around whom a great deal of drama revolves but with little real consequence. Charles Brandon and sundry young buddies of Henry's are not very well defined either. Thomas More is perhaps a noble failure in this case: the writers wanted to properly display this apparently two-sided man- on the one hand, a humanist who sought world peace and did not allow his proximity to power to corrupt him; on the other, a religious zealot who burned Protestant \\"heretics\\" at the stake when he was given the chance. Unfortunately, what we get in the show is a sudden transition, with no explanation, from a Thomas More who is evidently displeased when Henry orders him to burn Lutheran books, to a Thomas More who solemnly explains to his family the necessity of burning heretics. Of course real people can often be very contradictory, but the writers are unable to convey this believably for the screen.     I will not really dwell on the historical inaccuracies- these, to me, do not make or break a historical drama, provided that the departures from fact have some artistic merit. Unfortunately just such a thing occurs with the characterization of Thomas Tallis. Surely, surely the writers could have found something interesting from the life of the real Thomas Tallis, instead of fabricating the notion that he was a homosexual. This, in itself, would not be bad, except that before and after this revelation, we get very little sense about who Tallis is, what motivates him, what his inspirations are, etc. He is otherwise such a peripheral and undefined character that, when he was revealed to be gay, I could only shrug and ask \\"so what?\\"     It probably be too much to ask that the characters speak in early modern English, but the dialogue here is generally not very inspired, often bland and approaching cliche. The most memorable lines tend to be taken from history, such as Wolsey's words upon his arrest (\\"If I had served my God as diligently as I did my king, He would not have given me over in my grey hairs\\").    To conclude, I will repeat that I enjoyed the show. I don't want to give the impression that it's not worth watching- I will probably begin the second season before long. However, in terms of a historical drama that provides a kaleidoscopic view of a certain time and place, I've seen far better than the Tudors; I Claudius and the more recent HBO series Rome spring to mind.
0061649694|4.0|I had never heard of Coraline until I read about it on a book blog.  I borrowed it from my local library and devoured it in about 2 hours.  Neil Gaiman, who I've since come to appreciate in the form of his adult novel American Gods, writes a strange little tale of the headstrong and clever Coraline and her adventures \\"through the looking glass.\\"  This book is genuinely creepy and all that business about the imposter parents having buttons for eyes and wanting to sew buttons on Coraline's eyes with a sharp needle and some thread not only makes my eyes water, but is creeping me out even as I type this.     Coraline is a quick read wonderfully rich and textured fairy tale with a dark underbelly. *insert shudder here*  I'm looking forward to the movie, but be sure to read the book before you see the movie...especially if you have small children!

0385751893|5.0|I bought this book after watching previews of the movie. I didn't know what to expect but was deffinetely not expecting this. It was a very easy read as it is told through the mind of a 9 year old boy but at the same time it is very fascinating. I have never given much thought to the holocaust and I am ashamed to admit it. It is just not somrthing that I have had to worry about and was not taught about it in school as I did not go to school in the United States. I am so glad I read this book and even though it is fictional there is so much truth to it that it really opened my eyes to things I didn't know. Yes, I knew of the holocaust and I knew it was a horrible time in History but to read this is like waking up to reallity. I was so shoked with the ending that I just cannot stop thinking about Bruno and his Nazy family. Even though they were the \\"Bad People\\" you can't help but feel incredible pain at the outcome. I hope people read it and have the same eye opening experience I had.
B000000YIQ|3.0|\\"Way Out West\\" was a very different sounding recording for its time, as was Rollins' \\"Freedom Suite.\\" I have given this album several listens and just find the whole thing on a musical level to be quite technically great, but the overall quality of the music is empty, because of the absence of a chordal instrument (i.e. piano, guitar). Perhaps many people don't need to hear the chords, but I always liked chords in music. I feel that they help round out the overall sound. If you like Sonny Rollins, this is still an album worth picking up just to hear what it is, a very different record for Rollins. If you're interested in hearing Rollins playing against chords in a fuller band check out his albums \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" and \\"Tenor Madness.\\" You can't go wrong with these.

0375826726|5.0|This series has gone beyond my expectations.  It's obvious Paolini is not just making it up as he goes.  He has tied up all the loose ends he can and that causes me to trust he will tie them ALL up by the time the tale comes to an end.  I admit to disappointment in there having to be a fourth book, but it happens!  I'm glad he chose to tell the story in its entirety rather than cut it down to nothing.  Hey, I love a good 900 page book!  Tolkien, and Karen Hancock both found three books to be too brief!  Four seems to be just right.    I love the surprises in this book!  Surprises I never saw coming and after they are exposed, realize what perfect sense they make.      The characters were hard for me to remember at first, but I fell in love with them all over again in no time at all.  Hurray for a hero like Eragon - mistake-prone, attempts at making up for them, willing to do the right thing, tired yet determined.  Gentle and strong.  And Saphira!!  I felt like I got to know her like I haven't before!  The perfect compliment to her Rider.  She's fierce and she LIKES it!  :)      Each paragraph is exquisitely written with details described in all 5 senses.  I cried several times at the pure poetry and jumped up and down at the heart-thrilling joy of good characters, well-written prose, exciting fantasy and pure enjoyment.    Well done, Mr. Paolini, well done.
B001KVZ6BG|4.0|Danny Boyle had just given us one great and amazing story. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is such a heartwarming and truly endearing movie about a young man in India's version of 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' Jamal is about to win the big prize in the show, he is one answer away from the big prize; but then, he is arrested because they suspect he cheated. Police officers 'question' (read...torture) Jamal and he finally tells the police how he knew the answers to each questions: he tells them the story of his life. What a heartbreaking, ingenious and interesting life for such a young man. The movie is beautifully edited and has a great soundtrack. The acting is amazing for first time protagonists. Highly recommended.
0618918248|5.0|This book isn't just ground-breaking in its approach to calling out religion for it's frauds, its historically significant and vital to the modern, intelligent, free-thinking and still evolving world. Highly recommended, especially to anyone who fears it. Richard Dawkins reveals himself as a kind and brave voice that articulates what a significant portion of the world has been suspicious of since the dawn of science. We are free.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Title of Record is Filters most popular record.  It's almost hypnotic when listened to.  It slightly edges out Short Bus (although I give both a 5-star rating) because of it's excellent production.  Both albums have excellent lyrics.      This album is extremely innovative without being too raw.
0956010903|5.0|It is of course amazing. The only thing I don't really love about it is the size. It is really only about 100 pages. If you are looking for a short read this would be perfect but if you are hoping to read something as long as J.K.'s other books this wouldn't be the book. tHis book goes to a charity cause and it is very nice of J.K.. If you are a total devoted Hp fan (you would no what that is if you are one) i am hoping you already read this.  hope this helps!!
B001GM28HO|5.0|The music industry has been so washed up lately that I hardly keep track of any of the \\"new\\" acts. Lady Gaga busted into my eardrums with \\"Just Dance.\\" I thought to myself: \\"Is this just another artist with only one good song on their CD?\\" The album is hot, fresh, new, and innovative! It is like putting Britney, Madonna, Janet, and Gwen in a blender and shaken it up! My albums favorite moments are: \\"Just Dance\\", \\"LoveGame\\", and \\"I Like It Rough\\". The whole album is captivating and club ready! The best part is great music for a small price! You may not like every song because each song seems to touch into a different music genre. The best way to listen to the music? CRANK IT UP LOAD!!!

B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Last night a friend invited me to watch the DVD with him and his two kids - aged 10 and 14. The 14 year old saw Dark Knight 6 times in the theater.    In watching, I was reminded of the terror wrought in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago. The whole world was shocked and disgusted by the senseless killing spree perpetrated by a gang of thugs hyped up on drugs and somehow convinced that shooting and stabbing innocent people supported their \\"cause\\".     I suppose if a film crew was able to recreate the Mumbai melee and amp it up with state of the art special effects and high definition, explosions, pounding music and high profile actors, the resulting movie would be huge hit.     It bothers me that violence and evil are such a huge attraction for mainstream audiences, especially our younger generation. That they're all \\"gaga\\" over Heath Ledger and his portrayal of the criminally sadistic Joker - and his subsequent suicide - is a sad testament to what's important to our youth today, and who they look up to.      In summary, I can't imagine how much better I would have felt if I had taken a walk down at the beach and watched the sunset instead of spending two and a half hours with this movie that left me feeling awful.
0545128285|3.0|The stories remind us that:<br /><br />- we must do our duties responsibly<br />- it's better to face a challenge than to avoid it<br />- if we don't use our humanity we run the risk of losing it<br />- impostors are almost always unmasked and humiliated<br />- no one can trick death but the cleverer among us could postpone it<br /><br />[I tried a long sentence but then I thought that a bulleted list would be more informative]<br /><br />The tales are short and easy to read and the context is the 'real' world where wizards and witches live amongst us but sometimes they hide and the most direct way for us Muggles getting to know them is through reading about them. Each short story is followed by an equally lengthy commentary by Professor Dumbledore which should help free-time-challenged parents of little self-readers understand what the story is really about, just in case they might be lazy enough to simply read the tale and not think a lot about what the tale was supposed to mean.<br /><br />Dumbledore's comments are themselves annotated by Ms. Rowling, whenever clarifications or explanations may be needed. Dumbledore's commentary, besides clarifying the meaning adds some historical context and, sometimes, humor. Since there are no commentaries on Dumbledore's interpretations, the parents or other mature persons assisting the children with the reading may still have to interpret Dumbledore's writings which proves, once again, that there is no such a thing as a free lunch.<br /><br />The book ends with a note, indicating that the proceeds from selling the book go to a worthy foundation that aims to move children confined to large institutions to single family homes.<br /><br />The 110 small pages in large type plus the 10-page introduction can be read in about one hour by an adult but I can see how it may take a kid one night per story if they are read at bed time. The sketches are well done and they illustrate the story well.<br /><br />The best thing about these stories is that they incrementally expand the Harry Potter universe and offer HP's fans some hope of, possibly, more to come. However, the book is too short and it leaves the impression that not a lot of effort was made in putting it together. Sometimes, Dumbledore's commentary appears to be him channeling the author's critique of the author's own 'real' and immediate world.<br /><br />I am giving this book 3 stars because I consider it 'above average' but not by much. Like the ketchup on the happy meal, some kids might enjoy it but, most, I suspect, could do without. I hope that Ms. Rowling is busy working on something more substantial.offer HP's fans some hope of, possibly, more to come.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|To be clear this is a review of the dvd for Dark Knight not just the movie itself. As for the movie I'll say I bought it for Heath Ledger's part in it nothing more. The movie is too long and, in some parts, boring. The Joker is the only good part of the movie.   Now for the disk. It doesn't have any special features. In fact there is nothing added to this disk to add value to it. It has \\"play, scenes, and languages\\", that's it. This measure seems to be infecting all the big releases of late and I wonder if it's to push blueray sales. If so why are those with older TVs being punished? I can buy a blueray player but won't get any benefit from it's superior quality so there's no point of buying one. If it's to upsell the 2 disk set then I should get features out the wazoo for the added price.  I've very disappointed in the direction the movie industry appears to be taking with this and other recent dvd releases and wish I hadn't bought this movie now that my eyes are opened. Given the market we have, it is unwise to take away features we have come to expect and expect us to pay the same prices.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|You know when you hear a great song or a great guitar riff in a song it fills you with emotion, almost to the point you can feel the music?  Case and point, the guitar solo in the middle of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb or Jason Mraz's I'm Yours to name a few of my favs. Sorry, but this album makes me feel no emotion what so ever and ends up just sounding like noise after a while.  If his song came on the radio I would probably just ignore it or change the channel.    I'm a big fan of American Idol and think there has been some great talent that comes from the show.  I even thought David Cook did some great covers on the show, but this album is not his best work.    Go ahead and flame away...
B00006FDCD|4.0|I first saw It when I was about 11 when my brother and I rented it from the video store.  I had always been a tad frightened of clowns and thanks to this movie (and the book), I'm now completely afraid of them!  Well not as much as I used to be, but It was definitely a large contributing factor.<br /><br />Onto the movie... I thought that for the most part, especially because It was a made-for-TV movie that it captured the major themes from the book.  Now I had watched this before reading the book.  After reading the book I watched the movie again and came to find that several things were left out, probably due to what is allowed to be shown on television (this was not broadcast on cable, I believe it was on ABC) but I thought some of the acting could have been better than it was.<br /><br />The one person who I thought really shined (no pun intended to Stephen King's other incredible novel....) was Tim Curry.  I was in total disbelief that he was this demonic clown!  Who knew he is able to delve into rather disturbing roles!  He didn't sound like himself at all (no accent); his voice was really distorted but that made him all the more scary which really worked in his favor and the movie's favor as well.<br /><br />Everyone else did a pretty good job, and casting Richard Thomas in the main role of Bill was a wise decision.  I saw this before John Ritter passed away and thought he was excellent as well.  Now when I watch the movie I always get a little sad when I see him, especially if I watch with the commentary.  Tim Reid was a good choice for Mike but at times I thought he overacted a bit.  Still it was fun to see the dad from Sister-Sister in something much darker.<br /><br />As for the plot, a lot of things that were in the book were not included here which made for some holes.  We are never told where It really came from like we are in the book.  That was a rather important plot point that should have been here and if Stephen King had been a part of this adaptation, I'm sure he would have included it.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a horror fan (and don't mind the lack of special effects; this was made in 1990 after all) you'll most likely enjoy this adaptation of Stephen King's It.<br /><br />You'll never feel the same way about clowns again.....ncluded it.      Bottom line: if you are a horror fan (and don't mind the lack of special effects; this was made in 1990 after all) you'll most likely enjoy this adaptation of Stephen King's It.

0956010903|1.0|I pre-ordered this back in July as a Christmas treat for myself.  I was really looking forward to it, but incredibly disappointed with the quality and minimal contents, which were good for a quick view but are not something I'd look at more than once.  It didn't live up to my expectations at all.  I've returned my copy and will buy the standard edition to read the stories.  Maybe for kids it would be more exciting and attractive...
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Many would agree that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is an excellent film, deserving 5 stars here on Amazon review. But the DVD (widescreen single-disc edition) just deserves 3 stars. Note:<br /><br />1. There are NO special features on this DVD. No deleted scenes, or other extras usually accompany other DVDs. On the Main Menu section, you will see the display of three things: [1] PLAY, [2] SCENE SELECTIONS, [3] LANGUAGES. That's it. Nothing else was included in this DVD. Very disappointed. My wife said, \\"that's it?!!! Where are the deleted scenes??\\"<br />2. It also includes a paper insert that tells you \\"how to get your copy of digital copy of The Dark Knight\\" with the authorization code.<br /><br />Also, you will note from other reviewers that 2-disc set also does not have needed \\"extra\\" stuff (deleted scenes, etc.). Someone told me that, in the future, they will release another edition (perhaps, they will call it, \\"the collector's edition\\" or \\"director's cut\\") that will include deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />So be informed when you purchase this or another edition of \\"The Dark Knight\\" DVD.
0316017922|3.0|This is a well-written book with many anedoctes but without an innovative, sound theory. It is as if Caldwell found several pieces that are interesting, but he misses the chance to put them together in a coherent way. The whole theory - that exceptional people are mostly the result of a series of fortunate circumstances - is all very well, but there is nothing more to it. Buy it if you want to pick a few amusing anedoctes, but nothing more.     Finally, the idea of \\"successful\\" does not even deserve some reflection, in a book that is \\"a story of success\\". Maybe it is obvious for many of you that Bill Gates is a successful person, or that Nobel Prize winners are successful people. But there are some 6 billion humans on Earth and only a few Fortune magazine and Nobel Prize winners are successful? What about the rest - all condemned to mediocrity?
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Premise of the movie: Wesley Gibson is a young professional who has grown up without a father, and never learned to stand up for himself. His girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend, his boss constantly berates him, and Wesley goes through life bored and complacent. While picking up his anxiety medication, Wesley is approached by Fox (Angelia Jolie), who tells him that his father has been killed, and that his assassin is now after Wesley. This is where the action begins - Wesley is introduced to the 'Fraternity' and told that his mission is to avenge his father's death. He goes through extreme and often brutal training that taps into the skills he never knew he had, only to find that all is not as it seems. (Cannot say more without ruining the movie)<br /><br />I'm not one to rent action movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed 'Wanted'. Besides the amazing cast - Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman to name a few - the special effects were stunning, the story compelling and the movie definitely very entertaining. I watched this with a few friends, and we had plenty of \\"Woah! Did you see that?\\" moments. The only negative to 'Wanted' was that it was almost too fast-paced. At times, the movie felt rushed, and the story line could have been stretched-out more without losing the fast, action appeal.

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I won't waste time rehashing what everyone knows about this movie, I'm chiming in to tell you to BEWARE that the supplements on this fabulous 2-Disc Edition SUCK.  They are MINIMAL at best, and the sheer fact that WB or the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to stop counting money long enough to put together a 5 minute tribute to Heath Ledger is appalling.      I guess this is yet another example of the studios soaking us for money...I'm sure there'll be an \\"EXTENDED\\" or \\"DIRECTORS CUT 4 DISC EDITION\\" down the line someday soon.      Warner apparently realized the audience for this disc would be huge, so they didn't feel like they had to put any effort into the extras.  Sad.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I'm still trying to digest the enormity of this amazing fete!  Watching Petit from the ground, he looks little more than a speck.  It's almost hard to believe that this actually happened.    This film gives us a lot---first the sheer spectacle of the event. That would be enough reason to watch it.  But it does a lot more.  I loved the early films of the young Petit and his friends romping in the green grass of the south of France as they prepared for the performance.  The spirit of innocence and joy as they plan to do the impossible is really nice to see.      Then there is the inspiration that many may draw from the film--that nothing is impossible if you believe in your dream and are willing to work very hard to bring it into reality.  The film does not stint on showing the exhausting preparative work that went into making this happen.    There's a real transcendent aspect to this, too.  Petit says that death is very near when he's doing this.  He says that if he should die on this attempt that it would be beautiful to go while doing what one is passionate about.  He talks a lot about living on the edge, each day..and there is a lot of inspiration one can draw from that.  The one moment that struck me the most in the whole film was after he overcame his initial fear on the crossing and a smile broke out on his face.  As his companions said, they knew that he was home free then....he was in the zone...and his incredible antics on the wire at that time are truly mind boggling.      Then, there is the mystery aspect---the fact that the deal is illegal gives the story a bigger emotional charge than it would have anyway. It's really fun to see the figures huddled beneath the tarp while the guard smokes his cigarette a few feet away.  A lot of folks will cheer the fact that these kids were able to pull it off.      Then there is the dimension of the relationships of his \\"team members\\" to Petit.  He is obviously a charismatic guy whose passion for his dream enlisted blind faith in his friends.  What is touching and also sad is the way the friendships, including that of his long time lover, ended after his great triumph.  The film doesn't neglect this aspect of the story, although he doesn't hit us over the head with it either.  As another reviewer said, it's important to see what such one-pointed ambition can cost in terms of one's overall humanity.      All in all, it's a very satisfying picture of one man's amazing experience---really worth watching.    One has to wonder how Petit reacted at the events of 9-11!  Given his nature, he would have had to taken it very personally.

Templeton has weaved together an international co-production between studios in Britain and Poland, using stop motion animation and digital effects to create a modern retelling of the Sergei Prokofiev musical.    There are plenty of reviews of the movie itself, but the amazon.com description does not include information about the plethora of extras on this new Region 1 DVD.  Included are:    The musical themes   The story in pictures   The making of Peter & the Wolf   Behind the scenes documentary   Audio commentary   Educational workshop    If you are worried about buying an $18 DVD for just a 32 minute feature, you can rest assured you are getting much more than that.
0307346617|2.0|I enjoy a good \\"scary\\" zombie book and this fell flat. Regardless of which character was regurgitating their \\"thoughts\\" on what happened, the stories were all the same - dull and told in the same flat format. This book was poorly written, boring and difficult to finish.
B000LV63SQ|4.0|Once upon a time, music was not a product created and distributed by huge corporations on a strictly for profit basis. There were a lot of great bands, and a lot of great records. So many, in fact, that an album of this caliber could easily be overlooked.    Townsend, Lane, Clapton & Watts together? Get outta here.    This is really a fine record. Strong material and great musicians doing it pretty much just for the love of music. \\"Keep Me Turning\\" and \\"Annie\\" remain favorites after all these years, the rest of the selections range from good to outstanding.    Rough Mix has a timeless sound to it. Annie is a song that might have been popular a hundred years ago. Ronnie Lane was a unique artist, and this is a great way to get exposed to his work. Highly recommended.
1416562605|1.0|The author is honest and does give a true picture of Indian society and its social differences but let me know any one country which doesn't have it flaws. I personally feel it is India bashing book to please some (you know whom). My father comes from a similar village like the protagonist of this novel Balram but being poor and even after working full time as a child he managed to finish his engineering under lamp posts and is a successful entrepreneur now. My pa is not the only one here, we have many Balrams in our country but not all choose to murder, conceit their masters to be successful neither all masters are the stork or the mongoose. I would have been happy if the author could provide any solutions to the socio structure in India, in his interview printed at the end of the novel he just merely says \\"As to what lies in India future-that's one of the hardest questions in the world to answer\\". Most NRI's (non resident Indians) do that, running from India to make a good life and coming back to write books and doing nothing except being sarcastic.....grow up Mr. Adiga!
B001GJ3VYG|4.0|I don't think the album is as great as 'No Angel' but after waiting 5 years, I'm just so glad the album has materialized. Compared to 'Life for Rent' the album seems pretty equal, but I know this one probably had more meaning for Dido. Dido has stayed true to her style and remains ethereal.    In order of song preference (refering to the Deluxe edition):  The day before the day - My favorite, sad and beautiful  For one day (bonus track) - Very catchy, but I don't think it suffers quality for it and adds something unexpected for the album  Grafton street - I love the Celtic sound and Dido's voice in this one, especially  Us 2 little gods - strummy, hummy and acoustic, I love the up-tempo  Summer (bonus track) - I'm wondering why it wasn't chosen for the main album, one of the better tracks  Let's do the things we normally do - Mysterious and melodic  Burnin love - Warm and sleepy (sounds very much like Sarah Mclachlan)  Don't believe in love - On the straightforward side, but I like the message nonetheless  Quiet times - Sweet and genteel  It comes and it goes - Poignant and soft   Never want to say it's love  - fits in the album, but not very original or memorable  Look no further  - a logical preview, describes the theme of the album  Northern skies (rollo mix) (bonus track) - better than the original   Northern skies - a logical, less resonating song, but I couldn't think of a better ending
B00000IQW5|5.0|I love airplanes and all the great actors in this flick. Spielberg doesn't waste a single frame. If you have a heart you'll love this movie.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|Great movie, I really enjoyed it. I took my senior father and 10 year old son and all three of us enjoyed the show thoroughly. Good story line, nice to watch a real good movie again. Yes I liked the Dark Knight, loved Get Smart, but this is a good, good movie.
0307269752|1.0|The first half of this book is a great read - well-written, captivating, conveys the northern European ambience well.<br /><br />HOWEVER - the second half is filled with descriptions of graphic violence, mainly against women, but also men and even a cat. Unless you have the stomach for this, DON'T read this book. I am very sorry I bought it.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|Even though the producers do not want to pinpoint the source of their inspiration, but I believe Ronald Syme's Roman Revolution historically analyzing this exact period was an inspirer for making suhc an awesome movie. The series are so good that one wants to watch them again and again and to relive Rome as it was depicting life of the simple citizens, freemen and slaves up to the senators, aristocrats and consuls. It is an essential feauture of the film that the life of Rome in its totality is so amazingly interpreted. The role of women was a central issue too.   Surely there are historical aberrations, but then who wants movies to depict exactly what it was then. The most impirtant thing is the atmosphere, the thinking, the philosophy of the period and I can not name any other movie or series which could rival Rome in that sense.   I only wish they continued in the same vein. Rome's existence makes me feel very happy. Great Job! Bravo to the actors, the directors and the whole team that worked on this movie from the minutest details to seeminly trivial points.  Tigran Mkrtchyan  Armenia
B001F12J48|1.0|Since a good number of people were able to work out the 3-D thing (or were happy with it to begin with), we decided to give it a try.  I have some 3-D videos and have done well with them, so figured why not.  Well, we had the same problems with the 3-D that so many others have had -- double images on close up, washed-out color and very little 3-D \\"effect\\" in the background.  We followed the viewing suggestions in the DVD case.  We tried some of the solutions suggested by other posters on movie  boards.  I even tried another type of 3-D glasses that came with a rollercoaster video I have from years ago, nothing helped.  So glad they included the 2-D version, as that was excellent.  A suggestion: Try viewing the 2-D version using the 3-D glasses.  It made the colors really shine and stand out, even added a depth to the scenes where proper 3-D would have been most breathtaking (the Northern Lights, the \\"rollercoaster\\" type scenes, etc.).  It made the 2-D version more fun to watch and is the only reason why I'm not returning this for a refund or exchange.
0743298039|4.0|I just finished this novel and I liked it.  I was torn between not liking Vida Winter, to feeling truly sorry for her, to really liking her by the end of the book.  I thought the main character Margaret was a bit too mousy at first, and then she became stronger.  Ms. Setterfield sets her book up with a Beginning, Middles, and Ending, with another Beginning. Well worth your weekend.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This movie is so much fun and still makes me break into a huge smile whenever I think about it.  I never particularly liked or disliked ABBA, but now I find myself dancing & singing (not a pretty sight) no matter where I am when \\"Dancing Queen\\" comes on the radio.  I liked that Pierce Brosnan doesn't sing well - he gave it a good shot and it made the character more endearing to me.  But the revelation for me was Meryl Streep - she radiates pure joy.  Christine Baranski & Julie Walters are side splittingly funny.  I saw the stage show a few years ago and thought it was \\"cute\\".  The movie is a million times better in my opinion.
B001IF252M|4.0|I got this adapter to connect my MacBook to my 24\\" Gateway monitor. I wanted VGA because I already have the DVI connection on the monitor tied up with my PS3, and wanted to retain the ability to switch between the two sources.<br /><br />Well, I was kind of bummed by the performance of this adapter with my MacBook/monitor combo. I'm sure it's not the adapter's fault, but in my experience the MacBook didn't want to output the native 1920x1200 @60Hz my monitor wanted. Instead, when the MacBook said it was outputting that resolution, the monitor's status told me that it was receiving 1280x1024 @60Hz. Naturally, this looked horrible.<br /><br />I dialed down the output a bit, to 1600x1200, and other resolutions (even 1440x900) and in those modes the output was correct, but I got a wavy, unstable image on my monitor. Sometimes it would stabilize for a while, but  it was still not native resolution and thus looked pretty chunky.<br /><br />A call to AppleCare eventually solved my problem. The solution? I had to use the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter instead, and use that DVI connection on my monitor. It seems that with the new MacBook the analog output isn't quite compatible with my monitor for some reason. While my previous MacBook handled VGA output with no problems, this one refused to play nice with my Gateway monitor.<br /><br />My suggestion is to use this VGA adapter only if you have no other choice. If you have DVI available as an option on your monitor, you may want to go with Apple's other adapter, as digital output shines on this MacBook. It's too bad, but new technology sometimes leaves old tech in the dust.<br /><br />I will hang on to this adapter, though. I may have better luck with other monitors or HDTVs in the future.
B000056HE9|5.0|When I was a kid, I dreamed of being able to watch this delightful film any time I wanted, never figuring that dream would actually come true.  When we bought our first VCR, this was one of the first videos I played in it and I wore the tape out.  Now having the movie on DVD is an added treat.  Cary Grant at his most debonair and persuasive, Loretta Young at her most gracious and unsure, David Niven at his most sincere and perplexed -- and Monty Woolley is a delight.  The Mitchell BoyChoir's \\"O, Sing To God\\" made me hunt high and low for the hard-to-find soundtrack and the harder-to-find sheet music.  The harp scene in Mrs. Hamilton's mansion, the ice skating in the park, all everyone's favorites.  It's old-fashioned, it's out of step, and it's a treasure beyond words.

B00129H7VS|5.0|Like others before me have said, this is one of the greatest mini-series ever.  But I'm not going to review the series, that's been done countless times before.  First off let me say that I am a hardcore Band of Brothers fan, and WW II history.  When I found out this was coming out on Blu-Ray I wanted it.  After reading the reviews of it, I bought a Blu-Ray player just for this series, that's how much I love it.  I love the picture-in-picture special feature, where you have the men of E company talking while the show is on.  However what I love most is the awesome picture.  I have the original DVD set, so I decided to do a comparison.  Well there was no comparison.  In the first episode where Sobel is grilling them at Camp Toccoa I notice on the original that you can't read his name tag on his uniform, but on Blu-Ray it is crystal clear, but anyway that's just one of the many details you can spot.  Excellent, and a must buy.
0316017922|5.0|Rarely does a book require immediate action from the reader.  \\"The Rights of Man\\" by Thomas Paine moved America's founder's to action.  \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" moved Vladimir Lenin to enslave a nation--and allowed Stalin to enslave many more.  \\"The Origin of Species\\" launched a crusade against tradition that grows in intensity with each subsequent generation.  (Listverse has a list of the 10 most influential books of all time, admittedly subjective.)<br /><br />I Can't Believe It's Not a Novel<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell might have penned the next book to change history.  \\"Outliers: the story of success\\" (Little Brown, New York) takes the reader on a marvelous tale of men and women who toiled and strained to rise above their meager starts to become . . . great.  There are world-class hockey players, software and computer billionaires, great lawyers, mathematicians.  All of these \\"outliers\\" fall many standard-deviations from the top of their kind.<br /><br />And like a great fairy tale writer, Gladwell deftly draws the reader deeply into his little secret:  \\"All is not as it appears.\\"<br /><br />Was there foul play that made these people rich?<br /><br />Did the hockey players' parents cheat?<br /><br />Were these geniuses not as smart as they pretended to be?<br /><br />Like the titillating headlines in supermarket tabloids, \\"Outliers\\" makes you turn the page to find out Bill Gates's dirty little secret of success and why certain hockey players were heads and shoulders above peers of the same age.<br /><br />Masterful Plot Twists<br /><br />As the story unfolds--and Gladwell's action and tension rise and fall like a Dean Koontz novel--you learn facts far from scandalous yet more intriguing, even, than an illicit affair between Queen Elizabeth and Elton John.<br /><br />I'll leave the details to your reading of this fine book.  But I'll tell you why this book will change the world if we let it.  And why we should.<br /><br />America's Shameful Education Results<br /><br />Walter Williams once said that if he were the Grand Wizard of the KKK he could think of no better way to destroy blacks in America than to send them to our public schools.  Just this past Saturday, Morton Kondracke on Fox News' \\"The Beltway Boys\\" said that education could be Obama's Achilles' Heel--it is so bad and the teachers' unions so corrupt and selfish.  (Kondracke is the liberal.)<br /><br />If you have children in public school today, unless it's one of the top 100 or so districts in the country, you probably realize that your children will leave high school far less educated than you did.  Somehow we have to fix it.<br /><br />Not so much recently, but a whole lot when my kids were tiny, I read reams on education reform.  I drew many conclusions about the causes of our declining education--the unions, government meddling, bad homes, emphasis on entertainment over learning--but inventing a solution seemed out of reach.<br /><br />The Solution to a Quagmire<br /><br />Enter Gladwell.  \\"Outliers\\" explains the most plausible and unmentionable (in liberal elite circles) cause and solution to American education problems since Carl Childers identified the problem with a broken roto-tiller in \\"Sling Blade\\":  \\"I reckon it ain't got no gas, um hmm.\\"<br /><br />The model for fixing education quickly, inexpensively, and permanently is pretty straightforward.  Except for the special interests.  The young girl Gladwell models, Marita, has, like so many others in the book, made herself into an outlier.  From single female head-of-household home with a single bedroom for the family and a minimally educate mother, Marita has become a math wizard in a special KIPP middle school in one of the worst neighborhoods in New York.<br /><br />\\"Marita doesn't need a brand-new school with acrews of playing fields and gleaming facilities,\\" writes Gladwell. \\"She doesn't need a laptop, a smaller class, a teacher with Ph.D., or a bigger apartment.  She doesn't need a higher IQ ora mind as quick Chris Langan's.  All those things would be nice, of course.  But they miss the point.  Marita just needed a chance.  And loot at the chance she was given!\\"<br /><br />That chance, according to Gladwell, was the opportunity to work as hard as a wet-rice farmer in rural South China.<br /><br />Imagine how the NEA will attack Gladwell's recommendations:  longer hours in school, fewer but more intense \\"specials,\\" hours of homework every night, weekend classes, and no summer vacation.  The New York Times has already panned the book, as Gladwell gores one of its favorite oxen. (h/t Yglesias)  Yet Michiko kakutani, the reviewer, almost certainly did NOT read the book.  If he did, he clearly has little interest in education--he doesn't mention the only prescriptive part of \\"Outliers!\\"  That would be like reviewing the Bible and leaving out the part about God.<br /><br />Yet his evidence is unmistakable.  Summer break separates the rich kids from the poor kids.  In his always-remarkable research, Gladwell proves that kids from the wrong side of the tracks learn more in school--even in supposedly crappy schools in the inner city--than the rich kids in prestigious districts.  The problem is that they unlearn in the summers while the rich kids keep on learning.  The kids start pretty close, but each new school year, the poor kids start further behind the rich kids.  As Gladwell points out, \\"School works.  The only problem with school, for the kids who aren't achieving, is that there isn't enough of it.\\"<br /><br />How To Make It Work<br /><br />Before Christmas, buy and read \\"Outliers.\\"  For Christmas, buy  a copy for one member of your local school board.

B000MV8ABS|4.0|This is one movie I was excited to get when I found it in a used DVD shop.  It wasn't too scary, but was definitely a cult classic in the truest sense of the word.      It is off the wall at times, and the Tall Man is just freaky but excellent movie over-all for a cult classic, horror, and old sci-fi at same time
B000O179FO|3.0|I understand that this movie was \\"based\\" on groups like The Supremes and it was not intended to be a bio, but still I was disappointed at how little The Dreams resembled their inspiration. Yes, the glamour was there, but the music, which was fine, did not evoke The Supremes or even Motown.<br /><br />Beyonce, as Deena, plays the role of lead singer Diana Ross, but her role, both as a character and as a singer, is surprisingly weak in this film. Jennifer Hudson, as Effie, is supposed to represent Florence Ballard, and it is her character and singing that drive the movie. Effie's brother C.C. is the songwriter for the group, cranking out one hit after another.<br /><br />I didn't see the stage version of Dreamgirls. In the movie I felt confused about the firing and subsequent alienation of Effie. Deena began sleeping with Effie's fiance, Curtis (Jamie Foxx), the group's manager. Effie was missing rehearsals, arriving late, and \\"making trouble\\" due to \\"medical problems\\" (we find out later that she was pregnant by Curtis), so the entire group, who called themselves a \\"family,\\" fires Effie and pretty much tell her to get lost. For the next five years or so, while The Dreams go on to great success, Effie is a single mom on welfare, and not even Effie's brother knows that she has a kid. Then, when Effie suddenly comes back into the music scene, her brother tells her that he has written a sure-fire hit song for her that only she can sing, as if the last five cruel years hadn't happened! And suddenly all the bad things that happened to Effie were the fault of Curtis, not anyone else. What? During the final song, with Effie joining The Dreams once again, there is an odd scene with Curtis standing in the aisle staring, perplexed, at the daughter he didn't know he had. Likewise I felt confused about the character of Curtis. I know that larger-than-life people can be complex and both good and bad, but in this movie it was hard to figure out which was which. Near the end of the movie Curtis steals a song that he has no reason to steal, and then he is blackmailed into giving it back. Very strange!<br /><br />The nicest surprise of this film, and the character who most evoked Motown, was Eddie Murphy as the irrepressible soul singer Jimmy Early. I felt another brief and funny nostalgic moment during a glimpse of a Jackson Five-like group. Sometimes this film went into operatic mode, with sung dialogue and arguments, which I enjoyed.teals a song that he has no reason to steal, and then he is blackmailed into giving it back.

B000VH19CU|5.0|I was a senior in high school in 1994 when Cobain died. This album was hated by the poser rock fans & so called music critics but it was loved by people who understood it. Anger, sadness, alienation, rage! This album was brilliant when it was released but only to the few of us who were already making music like it. What is sad is all the garbage that followed this era. Sound-a-likes like muddle of pudd will never get it. There is passion behind this music. Music lessons will only help you rip other people off folks. This was emotion! Kids, if you like this, buy a cheap guitar and make something people hate, you will have made Cobain happy. THAT is punk rock! In my opinion, Nevermind sucks compared to this. Most of the bad reviews are from people that like poison and creed. These morons like party music with no sincerity. Listen Cobain killed himself or was shot, who cares? This album is different and I like it. I listen to Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, The Beatles, The Doors & Beck. I like interesting music. This is a powerful album. The Guitar sounds kick you in the face. It is muddy and mean. Forget the morons who hate this album, they don't know what they are talking about. Most of them listen to freakin nickleback or something. If you like Black Flag, Neil Young, The Pixies, Sonic Youth or Ministry, you will enjoy this sonic assault on the senses. Turn it up, it is made to piss off stupid pop fans. Bleh!

0143038419|3.0|I did not have any troubles finishing this book, although the Italian trip was the best part for me. I admire the author's ability to write about her \\"overactive\\" mind with such candor but sometimes there is too much detail. I liked the historical/geographical/yoga details in the book and the fact that she met and interacted with a lot of interesting people, although her story seemed too self-centered here and there. It was an acceptable reading overall but I think with some editing it could have been much better.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|The reason this gets a second star is that Heath Ledger is, of course, just as good as Heath Ledger was, and there are other very fine performances, not to mention beautiful design etc - a beautifully made movie. There's only one problem: it's evil. It's a senseless, cynical effort to rationalize and moralize senseless, cynical violence, with very direct suggestions that dehumanization and cruelty are the only possible responses to terrorism, that acts of violence by others leave us no choice.    I love a lot of violent spectacles and movies that dish up their share of sexism etc., but this one was no fun - it was creepy and depressing and weirdly didactic, and I felt betrayed walking out of the theater, like I'd be tricked out of a bit of my soul.
1848310293|4.0|The great Einstein-Bohr debate about physical reality is interesting not only to physicists, but also to great many readers interested in understanding the nature. This discussion between Bohr and Einstein over the interpretation of quantum theory began in 1927 at the fifth Solvay Conference. The debate over the ability of quantum theory to describe nature was fueled by many leading physicists of the time, some of whom directly contributed to the development of quantum physics, but later found themselves arguing against the theory they helped to create. Notable examples include Erwin Schrodinger, Paul Dirac, and Max Planck; the latter two did not actively participate in challenging the quantum reality. Bohr and Einstein spent many years intensely debating the nature of reality, and their discussions are known for very famous Einstein's comments such as; \\"God does not play dice,' or \\"God is slick, but he ain't mean,\\" and Bohr's response was \\"don't bring God into this (discussion of quantum physics).\\" Bohr argued vigorously against both deterministic and realistic world, but Einstein was equally adamant to defend these two physical and philosophical concepts. Deterministic philosophy was spurred by Newtonian mechanics; if we know a system and its physical properties (size, color, or position) at one point in time, then at some point in future we can predict the system based on these physical properties. Bohr argued that complete knowledge of the present can result only in a description of what the future most probably will be like, but there is no such thing as certainty in quantum world. This thought is mystified by what is commonly called Copenhagen interpretation, and its strong proponents were Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Max Born. Classical reality envisioned by Einstein was supported to a certain level by Schr&ouml;dinger. Recent historical research shows that Paul Dirac had his own doubts about Copenhagen school of thought (1), and Max Planck, the founding father of quantum physics, lived until 1947 did not participate directly in Einstein-Bohr debate because of his own insecurities about quantum reality. When experimental test for Bell's inequality was conducted by Alain Aspect and others, many thought that Einstein was definitely wrong, but recent advances say, not so fast. Physicist Roger Penrose and many others believe that quantum physics is an incomplete theory (2). Few weeks ago when Large Hadron Collider (LHC) conducted test runs, Stephen Hawking expressed pessimism of finding Higgs Boson in LHC experiments by stating that \\"I think it will be much more exciting if we don't find the Higgs. That will show something is wrong, and we need to think again. I have a bet of 100 dollars that we won't find the Higgs.\\" In a poll conducted in 1999 at Cambridge University, 55% of physicists polled for none of the existing quantum interpretations are right. This shows that not everything is settled in quantum physics.<br /><br />History of quantum physics is the best example to understand how scientists work. Their collective efforts to understand the universe we live in through publications, conferences, discussions correspondence and collaborative efforts are essential to scientific advancement. The author describes these things well in the book, but he falls short in certain areas; his current work uses previously published works of Max Jammer (3), Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg (4) as his few sources of information, but he could have researched a little more by talking to people who were directly associated with Einstein  or Bohr. In a recent book by Louisa Gilder (5), after interviewing a colleague of Boris Podolsky, she reported that Rosen or Podolsky never asked Einstein for his permission when they published the classic Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen paper, 'Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete.\\" It is also stated elsewhere that Einstein never thought this was going to be a paper; the ideas came out during informal discussions (6). The author discusses the results of crucial experiments such as tests of Bell's theorem, and other work that may have lead to confusions or mistakes.<br /><br />Many who are familiar with the history of quantum physics think that even though Einstein is unquestionably the best scientist mankind has ever seen but they also believe that he was grumpy old man who did not appreciate new and novel ideas in physics.

The author discusses the results of crucial experiments such as tests of Bell's theorem, and other work that may have lead to confusions or mistakes.

B00005JMXX|3.0|I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of \\"State of Fear\\", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say \\"oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years\\", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of \\"V-The Mini-series\\" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).     On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.     One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.  I like to think of it as more \\"a convenient half truth\\".     (PS - If someone else has used that, sorry, I didn't read all 700 reviews.)
B000V86OKG|5.0|Depending on who \\"fits\\" the cultural/ethnic/racial/political label created in the 1970s, Hispanics or Latinos can come from ancestries from around 20 or so Spanish-speaking nations in the Americas. I think that Europe's Portugal and Spain were also once in that group but are certainly no longer there, especially in the \\"Latino\\" label.    20 or so very diverse and distinct nations.    Disclaimers: I do realize that this coming issue of mine is perhaps a very jingoist issue, and I am also keenly aware that I've written about it before in a similar context but in for a different scenario. And yet the more that we become aware how culturally blind Hollywood is, the more they underscore their own cultural ignorance with minute mistakes that keep adding up to colossal mountains.    Last year I complained when Jimmy Smits, a superb actor on his own, was chosen to play the lead part in the CBS drama \\"Cane\\", a series about a wealthy Cuban-American family.    My historical issue was that although Jimmy Smits is a great actor, he was not what your typical Cuban sugar magnate would have looked liked in the racist Cuban society of the late 1950s and the Cuban-American refugee wave of the early 1960s. His casting for the part was intolerably historically inaccurate.    CBS picked Smits, a brilliant actor, I guess based on their perception of what a Cuban looks like (Smits is not of Cuban ancestry... his father, Cornelis Smits, was a Surinamese immigrant from Dutch Guiana, and his mother, Emilina, is Puerto Rican).    I suspect that because, like a lot of Cubans, the real Cuban person upon who Smits' character was based upon looked too \\"Anglo\\" and not enough of what Hollywood (and CBS) wanted all of us to think that Latinos should all look like, they hired a terrific Emmy-winning Surinamese actor who fits the sterotypical image of what Hollywood thinks Cubans should look like, to play the lead part.    Latinos are a culturally, racially and ethnically diverse group of people, andwe're not all made of one mold, as Hollywood wants you to think.    So that was then, and here's what has me all spun up in a new tempest in my demitasse.    Currently my absolute favorite TV show is Showtime's \\"Dexter.\\"    If you haven't seen this show, then go and buy these DVDs.    In the series, Michael C. Hall is absolutely brilliant as a serial killer who works as a blood expert for the Miami Metro Police while hiding the fact that he is also a serial killer. Dexter goes after bad guys, but he is still a truly disturbing psychopath pretending to be normal while killing bad guys left and right in a very orchestrated manner.    Dexter is television crime drama at its best. It is a brilliantly conceptual idea brought to life by really good actors and the gorgeous setting of Miami.    And because this show is set in Miami, several of the regular characters in the series are portrayed as Cuban characters, such as Dexter's boss, Lt. Maria LaGuerta, played superbly by Puerto Rican actress Lauren Velez and detective Angel Batista, also played superbly by Puerto Rican actor David Zayas.    Now enter season three, which introduced a new character, that of Asst. District Attorney Miguel Prado, another Cuban character played by, yep that's right: Jimmy Smits!    Smits is a terrific actor, and since by now he seems to be making quite a decent living playing Cubans on TV, the least that Showtime can do is hire some Cubans to write their Spanish dialogues for the series so that at least he can sound Cuban.    I know that this is pedantic, but everytime that Smits or the other \\"Cuban\\" characters speak to each other in Spanish banter, it is grating to Cuban ears to hear \\"non Cuban\\" Spanish being spoken.    Imagine that you are watching a foreign movie, let's say that it is a French movie... and all the dialogue is in French, and in the film there are two British actors who are playing American parts, and every few minutes they speak to each other in English, and instead of American English coming out of their mouths, what comes out is cockney English.    That's what (in my pedantic world of Virgos) I have to suffer everytime that LaGuerta, Batista and/or Miguel Prado talk in Spanish.    The straw that broke the camel's back a few episodes ago was when Miguel Prado (Smits) jokingly called Dexter a \\"filipolla\\" (or \\"gilipolla\\").    That's when I realized that the writer that Showtime has hired to write the Spanish for the series, not only has no idea about what Cuban Spanish sounds like, but also zero idea of what Latin American Spanish sounds like, as opposed to Castilian Spanish.    Having lived in Spain for a few years in my 20s, I know what that word means, which is essentially a curse word used by Spaniards; let me repeat that: Spaniards, to mean a-hole or jerk, etc.    I am almost 99% sure that no Cuban in Miami or Cuba or anywhere else in the Great Cuban Diaspora, has ever called anyone a gilipolla, unless perhaps they live in Spain and have picked up the term there... from Spaniards.    But in Miami? Naaaaaaaaaaaah...    A Cuban would have said \\"Maricon\\" or perhaps \\"Cabron.\\" But fili/gilipolla? Nunca!    Now imagine those two Brit actors playing Yanks in my earlier French movie example, calling each other \\"gits\\" or \\"wankers.\\"    Welcome to my pedantic hell.    And now for Showtime: My list of actor candidates who are actually of Cuban ancestry and thus a shoe-in for the part and who actually speak Spanish with a Cuban accent:    Andy Garcia (duh!!!! perfect for the part!... but probably too classy and too expensive to do TV).    Nestor Carbonell. He was great in \\"Canes\\" and also in \\"Lost City,\\" although I think that he wears eye make up?    Mel Ferrer... ah!... I think he's dead.    Desi Arnaz... fine, fine... he's definately dead; but how about Desi Jr.?????    Jorge Perrugorria    Cesar Romero ... fine! I know that The Joker is definately dead.    Julio Mechoso    Ruben Rabasa    Victor Rivers    George Alvarez...    Showtime: call me.
078322611X|5.0|Spoiler Warning!!! This is not a true film, it is unlikely that if you construct say a cricket pitch in your back garden, WG Grace will appear for a knock about. Now that being said, on with the film.     The premise is ridiculous, and how this got made is anyones guess, but it did and it is a very amusing and touching movie.    It harkens back to a time before Kevin Costner disapeared up his own behind and started making crap films (and I liked Waterworld!). I imagine Tom Hanks would have been better (he was amazing in Bachelor Party) but the story is so good, you would have to be the worst actor on Gods earth to mess this one up. James Earle Jones is great in it, Burt Lancaster is hammy but obviously enjoying himself. But the sum of the parts make up a wonderful film that I have watched time and time again, and I always cry at the end. I have a fractured relationship with my father and this film always makes me try that little bit harder.     Overall, suspend your disbelief and just enjoy a well crafted fairytale.
0452285186|5.0|This is funny and wrong in many ways, I am sure no one is going to massacre bunnies but the thought of a cute fluffy creature being suicidal is humorous, all we need next are sex addict turtles, or alcholoic monkeys.  To those they find it offensive, I bet u even find Family Circus funny but \\"racey\\".
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|but in this case, I defer to Andrew who wrote exactly what I thought, so that saves me some time. Oh, you have to sort \\"most recent first\\" or you wont know what I'm on about.     So what if you have to sit through a few ads? Go and spend the time shaping a sheet into an adhoc toga, stocking up on beer and ensuring your wife doesn't have a film ruining list of \\"jobs\\" for you to do.     Belushi is a colossus, his performance is Brando-esque and the clip where he gives his motivational speech about \\"no-one gave up when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbour..\\" I have seen as part of a lecture on Leadership at Officer Training School. The only flaw I would pick in this film is that University just isn't that good, and as a result, generations of students have been disappointed. Also the lyrics to Louie Louie are still as mysterious as they ever were.    In summary, if you had to pick 10 films to take down into the bomb shelter with you, Animal House would be essential. Put it this way, turn up at my bomb shelter without it and you aint getting in!
B001GQO50I|2.0|After all the negative reviews here, I thought it might be helpful to inquire from the record company itself about the legitimacy of their first generation claims.  Here is the response received from \\"Dr. Rhino\\" at Rhino Records:    Dear Bob,    Thanks for your email.    Bruce Botnick and Jeff Jampol (engineer and manager) both believed that  they had a copy made from the original recording. It was not until the  release came out, that Jeff found out that a superior source existed.     We sincerely believed all the statements made about the source tapes at  the time the production masters were delivered to us.    If you have any other questions, please let me know.    Dr. Rhino    The honesty here is refreshing. It's too bad something originally purporting to be first generation was being dangled before us.  So needless to say...caveat emptor!
B001AEF6C2|4.0|.. and speaking as a scientist, I have found that wearing a bra on your head may not have lead to the scientific breakthroughs that the success of this movie might have predicted, sadly. I still try it now and again, which causes some comment in the canteen at lunchtimes but there you go. Kelly Le Brock bears no resemblance to a badger in this film, which is surprising bearing in mind her name (she might want to think about that) but she is undoubtedly one of the sexiest 80s screen chicks ever. I mean, right up there with Ione Skye in the Rachael Papers or Tawny Kitaen (possibly not her real name) in Bachelor Party. Anyway, film good.    Not based on true story by the way.
7119005901|5.0|I have just finished reading this book and was moved to make a comment. First of all, I want to say that this is a complete version of  \\"Three Kingdoms\\", not an unabridged one.  The Foreign Language Press published this English translation made by Moss Roberts, in four volumes and 2340 pages, which include many notes, several drawings and some maps. The edition was very carefully done.  About the content, I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history.  One hint: at the end of volume four, a list of principal characters is included, which results very useful along the reading.  As always, thanks to Amazon that brought this book to my hands.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Get this, a big giant monster goes around treading on stuff. And also remains quite elusive bearing in mind it's the size of a skyscraper. It is according to the Director \\"very good at hiding\\". No, I made that up. He is though. At one stage, the monster puts a lampshade on its head and stands very still, and the heroes walk right past it without seeing it! No, hold on, that's Scooby Doo. The principle is sound though.     Seriously, the film is tense, I didn't find the handheld off-putting but as a dramatic tool, and it prevented us from seeing much of a back-story. I wanted to know what the monsters motivation was. I understand that a possible sequel will attempt to tell the monsters side of the story though. No, really. I have to say, I prefer the more traditional monster film with the army blatting away at the monster, and the monster is chucking tanks around and swatting planes. And there is a bit of that to be fair. The end is open to interpretation, but this film left me feeling satisfied, yet ready for more, and I'm very hard to please.
1577314808|2.0|A friend of mine recommended this book.  He is a personal trainer, and I am a female who really NEEDS a personal trainer but who cannot afford one (him) at the present moment.  I have a weight/food issue, and he told me to go buy this book and it would change my life, he promised!  ha ha.    I am a college graduate, and am about 40 pages into this book.  While I can appreciate SOME of what he is saying, this book is rathy wordy, and very difficult to follow.  I found myself reading a paragraph and then trying to sort it out in my head, and thinking. . Hmm, maybe it will get LESS confusing as I go along?  Uh, no.  That did not happen.  I will try hard to finish this book, but I doubt it is going to be as enjoyable a ride for me as it was for others.  Maybe I just don't \\"get it.\\"
0312427646|5.0|Bennett's sweet satire of politics and the British monarchy is also a surprising love letter to reading and the pursuit of knowledge. What is sometimes a comedy of manners is also a well-written, beautiful little book about finding happiness late in life in unexpected places. Filled with bon mots and gentle humor, Bennett masterfully weaves inticing plot with brilliant characterizations that bounce off of the page. In fact, the characters are drawn so well, that it is hard to believe the book is a slim 120 pages - the author is dead-on with his observations, and the bit of a surprise ending is right on the mark. There is little to criticize: the only hindrance to the novella's success is the strange fact that everyone the Queen encounters has never heard of famous writers such as Proust and Hardy. Aside from this, Bennett has crafted a divine, delicious romp that opens wide windows of thought that transcend the plot. There is more to take away from The Uncommon Reader than meets the eye.
B001G7SS96|5.0|I give the product a perfect 5 of 5 for reference level audio and video quality, and the extras are 4.5 out of 5, which is a big step up from the original Blu-ray release. I only give it 4 out of 5 stars for value though, since this is the release that should have come first. Warner bros kinda screwed us by making those that loved the film double-dip if they want the ultimate edition. If you don't have I AM LEGEND on Blu-ray yet, this is a must-own.
B00004CWO8|4.0|Act II where the prince meets the Swans is the highlight of the entire production. The story is about the prince of course, who is so wretched that he was entranced by the Swan King. But then, who wouldn't be, as danced by the magnificent Adam Cooper? Unbelievably agile, graceful, with arms truly the span of wings, he glides and floats and utterly seduces anyone who watches. The Swan was a reason for the prince to live, but the black swan was the reason for his downfall. The black swan was also danced by Cooper, with a sadistic, dangerous roguish energy, completely different from his role as the swan.   Skip all other parts except the ones with Adam Cooper in it. The Royal court scenes, like all British Royal related matter, are an utter bore.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|If you are a goth or emo kid, I'm sure you've seen this hundreds of times! But, I'm not here to bash goth kids, I'm here to review this film. It's a pretty good movie. I don't love it, but I like it. I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie. If you are a goth/emo kid, love HALLOWEEN, and Christmas, you'll love THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!!
0956010903|1.0|WARNING--  The outside of the box the CE is delivered in gives it away!!! The CE I purchased for my daughter's Christmas present- her BIG SURPRISE-- was delivered today and she immediately knew what it was.  The box says \\"Attention Muggles- Do not deliver or open until December 4th\\".  What an absolute disappointment that she will not have that surprise on Christmas morning!
B000002A46|4.0|I have had this CD for years now,{since it first came out} It has since become a classic in my home, and is played every Christmas. Mariah Carey was meant to sing Christmas songs, her high octave voice makes the music \\"soar\\" yet she still has her own \\"sound\\" to make the Christmas songs her own.I would highly recommend this CD as a gift since anyone should just luv it.
6305342776|5.0|If it's sci-fi, I'll watch it!  The Black Hole is a movie I'll watch over and over again.  It may have gotten a bad rap, but I'm very pleased with it.  I'm surprised it didn't do better since I think most younger kids would really enjoy this movie.  The music soundtrack is also wonderful!
B001D94L1Q|5.0|*****This 32 CD-Box Set is a \\"Limited Edition\\".  There have only been a certain number produced by DG!  My local classical retailer/distributor can't get any more of them based on an email from DG about it!  This means that you must get this while it's available or you might have to wait until people start selling it used or on ebay!*****<br /><br />---> This is the ONLY set of the complete works of Oliver Messaien on the market.  It's always a tricky thing comparing Messiaen recordings, they are all excellent and were all mostly authorized by the composer at the various recording sessions made before his death.  Other sets are just as good but are all partial (the new Decca and EMI sets and the Erato/Warner set).<br /><br />As part of Messaien's Centerary (b.1908) this set is quite special, since not only does it contain his entire ourvre from every repetoire and genre, but each recording has achieved classic status and are mostly reference recordings of the major works: Eclair Sur de La, Turangalila, St. Francis, etc. and the complete Piano and Organ works by his own pupils Roger Muraro and Oliver Latry etc.  All the conductors have also studied with him (Pierre Boulez, Myn Whun Chung, and Kent Nagano), not to mention a whole other slew of artists!<br /><br />Rare, unheard and unperfomed works were recorded especially for this edition to complete it, and even has a recording of Messiaen and Yvonne Loriod (his wife) playing piano duet!<br /><br />The box is as elegant as you see it...with many rare pictures and writeups, notes that were written by Messiaen on each work and full text translations.<br /><br />This set stands as an Grand achievement, as Messaien himself!  A wonderful oppertunity of new colourful music to explore and cherish!  A lifetime investment worth every penny!<br /><br />***Just remember, who knows how long it will last!!***
0345350499|5.0|The writing of Marion Zimmer Bradley is beautiful.  It stimulates your mind while you're reading and pulls you deep into the story.  This is by far my favorite version of the story of King Arther, and it is the best tale I have found regarding Morgaine and the island of Avalon.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a stimulating read that allows you to lose yourself in a story that will inspire you to look into the legend further.
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Yes, Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 \\"making off\\" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of \\"Gotham Tonight\\" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.    So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Enya and her beautiful ethereal and unique voice is just a classic.    Absolutely love all her work!
B000060OFT|5.0|I loved reading Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It is a classic tragic love story and I have every line memorized. I was so excited when this movie came out and I wasn't disapointed.<br /><br />I liked how it was modernized so viewers of today could relate to the play. I actually liked that the dialogue in this film mirrors the original text. Something would be missing if they changed the dialogue.<br /><br />Of course some of the acting is overdone and can be a little \\"cheesy\\" at times but it fits great with the story.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the music so if you liked the movie, you should pick up the soundtrack as well.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this DVD to the hopeless romantics out there as well as any fan of Shakespeare.
B00005QB42|4.0|I love her voice and the music is very relaxing.    I think an aquired taste for some but if you listen if you sit back and listen to closely you will definetly love.
B000001EGE|4.0|Elton John-Honky Chateau ****<br /><br />By the release of Honky Chateau Elton John was still a young song bird just starving for stardom. He still meant the things he was singing about because he was actually feeling and going through them.<br /><br />His confused sexuality comes through in tracks like 'Amy' as does 'Honky Cat' a song about a soulful boy who in one way or another is fed up with being concidered a black poser. But the scary thing is tracks like the satire fueled 'I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself' while meant to be upbeat, funny, and trite was eerily biographical of Eltons own thoughts at the time. Then there is 'Mellow' which might just be the best none single on the album. But it is the poetic beauty of Taupin's lyrics on 'Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters' mixed with Eltons georgious melody and all time best vocal that carry the album to classic status.<br /><br />While it might not be his best album ever, or ever his best from the time period, it might be his most personal even though he wrote none of the lyrics. Honky Chateau is a moment of beauty and despair for a true pop genius.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I was lucky enough to be part of this movie as an extra along  with a friend of mine. From start to finish the movie focused on  the complicated issues of female relationships.

B001DHXT20|4.0|Bruce Banner (lurking in South America and looking to purchase a pair of pants from a street vendor): \\"Tienes mas stretchy?\\"<br /><br />2008's THE INCREDIBLE HULK eases up on the psychological angst which so bogged down Ang Lee's 2003 version ([[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)]]). But let's not twist it, Bruce Banner suddenly isn't some happy-go-lucky bloke. He's still pretty damn tormented, he and his alter ego still the modern incarnations of Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Nomad scientist Bruce Banner will always be teeteering on the edge of losing control. Else, what's the point of his character? Just like he'll always be on a quest for a cure. And just like he'll always fail to find one.<br /><br />As a nod to Ang Lee's HULK and its conclusion, this one opens up with Bruce Banner still in Brazil, but now toiling as a day laborer in a soda-bottling plant. In his ongoing efforts to dampen his emotions, he's even resorted to taking martial arts lessons (not that Bruce becomes a wushu master or anything). He's got a watch which monitors his heart rate (any number nearing 200 beats is a worrisome thing).<br /><br />For a bit now, Bruce has been corresponding via e-mail with a Mr. Blue (can you guess what Bruce's code color is?). Mr. Blue has been assisting him with his latest attempt at a cure. But it's not too long of a wait before Bruce learns that the cure, isn't. In the short term, though, that's the least of his worries. General Ross has finally tracked him down and he mobilizes a strike force to fetch Banner.<br /><br />The film makes a point of keeping a running tally of Days Without Incident onscreen, the latest reading being 158 days. Ooops. Reset the count.<br /><br />I do think that Norton improves on Eric Bana, but I prefer Sam Elliott to William Hurt as the cold-hearted General Ross. And I think it's a wash between Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler is hotness on legs, and, as Betty Ross, she does well with the emotional, pining scenes. But I don't quite believe her as a biologist (she's a friggin' elf, isn't she?). But she and Norton produce some good chemistry, and you even buy into the tender Beauty & the Beast moments with her and the Hulk. Banner's core persona is marked by repression, by a tamping down of emotions. What's left is this husk desperate to stay even-keeled and unengaged and still. In a sexy and funny bedroom scene between Bruce and Betty, we learn that it's not only fear and rage which may trigger the change. Bruce, no matter what, just cannot afford to get too excited (Betty protests: \\"Not even a little excited?\\"). Thankfully, Norton is able to bring out nuances and some liveliness to Banner, even if much of the acting has to be done internally. But there's only so much you can do with that. Bill Bixby, bless his soul, got the most out of all the actors to have ever played this role. Still, the Hulk usually has to pick up the slack, and he doesn't do this thru snappy dialogue and fancy emoting.<br /><br />The movie is still character driven, but much more accessible than the Ang Lee adaptation. THE INCREDIBLE HULK benefits most from driving up the pace. This film is more action oriented and showcases more of what makes the Hulk so much fun. Know your audience, says the box office guru. And the Hulk's audience clamors for the mean, green monster to break stuff and demolish a bad guy or two. Maybe occasionally yell out: \\"Hulk is strongest one there is!\\" or \\"Hulk smash!\\"  No one takes to a rampage quite like the Hulk, and that's the candy we crave.<br /><br />General Ross is the recurring villain, but the main adversary for the Hulk here is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a veteran paramilitary operative who envies the power unleashed by the Hulk. Of course, the old science-gone-mad schtick enters the picture, framed in General Ross's scheme to dust off the ancient super soldier project. Risky experimentations enable cellular changes within Emil Blonsky, who soon mutates to freakish, super strong stature. I don't think the film officially labels him this, but Emil Blonsky becomes the Abomination, one of the Hulk's perennial adversaries in the comics. His clash with the Hulk is of epic proportions, brutal and earth-shaking, and taking place in the crowded New York streets. There is much fan joy here.<br /><br />No disrespect to Bruce Banner, Betty and General Ross, but the film perks up most, obviously, whenever the Hulk manifests. While I did like how Ang Lee's Hulk was CG'd, this new version looks better, more ferocious and somehow more grounded to reality, more fixed into his surroundings. He's featured in three pulse-pounding action set pieces, the best of which is the aforementioned Hulk Vs. Abomination shatterfest (although the other two segments ain't nothing to sneeze at, either).<br /><br />Keep an eye out for the film's fond winks to Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and the late Bill Bixby, as well as a tongue-in-cheek take on Banner's famous line. Also, I'm digging the coda scene, as a character from another Marvel Comics title pops in for a cameo and with a very significant offer to General Ross. More fan joy, indeed.<br /><br />The other day, in one of those throwaway stream-of-consciousness conversations one sometimes gets into, someone was asking me whether Bruce Banner prefers briefs or boxers. I broke it down for her.ates to freakish, super strong stature.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I've watched the Band of Brothers series on the History channel a few times, but I never really got around to buying the DVD. When I saw this was out on Blu ray at a good price, it was a must buy. This set could easily be worth $100 in my opinion, but I have to say this is probably the best value on Blu Ray right now. The clarity of the video has to be seen to be believed, and the audio is top notch.     As for the special features, each episode could probably be watched three times. Once just for the episode, one with a timeline that pops up facts and little video clips, and then once more with interviews popping up during the episode.     This is a great buy, and if you are deciding whether or not the picture clarity is worth it, IT IS! DVD doesn't even come close.
0618551050|5.0|Lee Smolin is quite a writer. He is able to explain some of the more complicated ideas in the physical universe with surprising ease. And his ability to entertain and engage the reader -- even while juggling some very mysterious and abstract entities -- makes you want to read more, even if you are having difficulty grasping the theory.     After reading the book, I believe that Lee Smolin has correctly identified \\"The Trouble with Physics.\\" And the trouble with physics appears to be its overspecialization in pure mathematics, which has managed to make theoretical physics as susceptible to sophistry and illusion as was once the case with metaphysics.       It was not always this way. Einstein distrusted pure mathematics to some extent. He even said: \\"In so far as the propositions of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and insofar as they are certain they do not refer to reality.\\" By this he meant that \\"Experience remains, of course, the sole criterion of the physical utility of a mathematical construction. But the creative principle lies in mathematics.\\"        Einstein explains (in his writings) that he tended to see \\"entities\\" during his initial phase of creative activity. And it was only after long and painstaking effort that he was able to formalize his thinking into a rational mathematical structure. He may have read something -- Einstein read a lot of philosophy -- or seen something in the field of experimental physics that caused him to question the fundamental premises upon which some aspect of scientific certainty was based. For instance, Newton's assertion that \\"space was absolute\\" was one premise that he began to question, and from there he was able to completely modify his concept of space and time.     But Einstein was always careful. For even though he believed that pure thought could, in and of itself, apprehend a credible model of the universe \\"as the ancients dreamed,\\" and that mathematics was the most reliable tool that the mind couldutilize in order to accomplish this feat, without experimental evidence it was all just \\"empty talk.\\"    Speaking of empty talk, Lee Smolin also recommends a return to philosophical discourse as a way to rectify \\"The Trouble with Physics.\\" Einstein has something interesting to say about this as well. With respect to epistemology he said: \\"The reciprocal relationship of epistemology and science is of noteworthy kind. They are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is - insofar as it is thinking at all - primitive and muddled.\\"    So the key to success appears to be triangulation between the epistemological, the mathematical, and the experimental, as truth and reality are so elusive that no one technique on its own will suffice.    Lee Smolin has done a great thing for science by writing this book. He may have succeeded in reminding us that in science, each generation must start anew and regard all that has come before them as signposts along the way, and not as a complete picture of physical reality.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I had heard and read so many good things about this movie, I was nervous to see it and have it not live up to my expectations. But it exceeded them. I laughed, I cried, I clapped...it brought out such a range of emotions. And the amazing thing was, this all came from watching robots?! For Pixar to be able to animate them in such a way that they show all their feelings and emotions...wow, wow, wow. It was just amazing. The animation was breathtaking, the story is great. This movie is touching and moving and with a very important message behind it all. I'm in love with Wall-E...you will be too.
B001IU8RWY|1.0|This along with their Wallmarket promotion strategy shows you the wonders that marketing to intellectual adolescents can achieve.      It took them eight years to just bring us some more unoriginality and childish cliches. These guys suck in their music and attitude. If you had more people like Angus, their kind of music would never have been invented. Angus would be going, 'rock? Who needs that? Check out this cool banjo solo!' *duck walks*     In terms of sheer mindlessness ACDC and Miley Cyrus are in the same boat.     Whoa!! How rock n' roll can you get?
B001ACY8D2|2.0|This album sure starts well.  Gobbledegook and track two (that's how much I dislike this album) were good songs.  Unfortunately Rasputin's previewer only let me listen two the first three tracks so I got suckered into buying it.  Every song after track two is the same song, over and over with glacial melodies, incredibly slow tempo, etc. etc.  I've heard more emotionally stirring muzak.  Do not buy this album thinking it is a pop record.  Do not buy it thinking that it is interesting music.  Buy it only if you are out of Enya albums to buy and you want Enya without hooks.
0956010903|4.0|First of all, this collectors edition is really awesome!  But, I found out that on the right bottom edge of the case, the leather  is slightly stripped off. Is this intended or unintended? Did anyone find this? This whole is not big but still, annoyes me a little.
0956010903|2.0|I, too, found the overall packaging to be disappointing.  It was inexpensively (Cheaply) made.  It would have been better if the metal was on the larger of the two \\"books\\" one sees in the photo.  But the metal is on the VERY Small inner book.  The larger, outside casing appears to be little more than hard, covered cardboard.  It's size is such that it doesn't Fit standing up on Any of my bookselves.  The stories are disappointing in that they are nowhere near as engaging as the Harry Potter series nor are \\"Albus Dumbledor's\\" commentaries.  Save your money. Buy the less expensive version to read and wait to see if the price for this version doesn't drop.  J.V.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is an excellent game for everyone in the family.  It is easy to learn and easy to play.  It is a house favorite.  Only down side is that it's really only fun for four people, the two and three person versions of the game aren't nearly as good.  Buy it, you will love it.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|In an era of brilliant documentaries, this one rises to the surface.  Cream of the crop. Miraculously, M. Petit had decided to film his progress and practice as a young man, so we see not only photos and current interviews, but lengthy sections of original footage.  It was absolutely captivating to see not only the high wire shots, but to see Paris and New York in the 1970s.  As a 40-something who first came to know Paris and New York in this era, it was beyond satisfying to see honest footage of the places I love. The clothes, the hair, the people, the freedom, the attitude -- it left me so homesick for a time gone by.  The interviews are intelligent, sensitive, and utterly heartbreaking.  If you dare to watch this, be prepared to be pulled in, and to have this film -- and this man -- on your mind for many days afterward.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Robert MacNamara was a major advisor and player in the Cold War.  He advised Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on the Cold War, the Bay of Pigs and the Vietnam War.  He has great insight into what happened and why it happened.  He admits mistakes were made and that he had to support things he did not feel comfortable with also.  In dealing with Castro, he found a man who would have allowed the use of nuclear weapons even if Cuba had been destroyed.  With the North Vietnamese, he found people who thought the Americans were colonizers and mystified by the idea that Americans thought the Vietnamese were pawns of the Chinese.  One look at their history would have told them that was not so!  MacNamara does not flinch from mistakes but he also doesn't believe that things could have gone any other way.  He points out what Americans believed and how they thought at the time.  He admits that hindsight helps him understand a lot now but he certainly didn't have it when events were happening.  Errol Morris provides a fair and balanced documentary for MacNamara.  It is also a work of art and has its own form of suspense.  A very good work by a wonderful director.
1878424319|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book.  I began reading self help books when I was 12, now 39, (I have struggled with depression most of my life).  Some books were more hurtful than helpful, obviously I have learned now, you take what you can use and leave the rest behind. Prior to the Four Agreements I would have to say The Power through Constructive Thinking by Emmet Fox was my favorite. Yes Ruiz covers wisdom others have always said, I do not believe that in as far as \\"thought\\" is concerned we as humans are going to find any \\"new techniques\\". It is all in the Bible, only the bible with its age old parables makes it difficult for us new age folks to comprehend! For me, Ruiz explained the tools in a way I could understand and most importantly, apply them.  Four Agreements? I can remember that many!  Yes he often repeats a topic or concept, but for me this is essential, how much of what we read do we actually retain?  There are for myself two ways I learn, it's either through painful experience or repetition, or both.<br /> Having read a great quantity of spiritual/self help books over the years, and knowing how this book came to me at a time when I so needed it, I have to say \\"When the student is ready, The Teacher Will Appear\\". A word of advice from someone who has searched endlessly for happiness and what it means, take what you can use and leave the rest behind. You dont have to buy the whole barrel of apples.  For this girl, it's all about my Perception.  I wish all the Psychiatrists/Psychologists/counselors had given me a clue. I have been prescribed up to 5 different psych meds at one time, still how I saw the world didn't change. For the past 2 years I only take one for depression.<br />  Agreement #1 is the issue I realized causes me all the problems I have.  How I talk to myself, about myself.  Now that I am aware, I can begin to talk nicer to me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who struggles with depression or relationships.
0440242576|1.0|I had to read this for a book group. The first part of the book brought up many issues such as non-conformity, group think, commercialism of the holiday....but the second half fell totally apart and there they were, right back in the thick of it, and very happy that their future son in law wasn't too dark. It read like a screen play, and read like the author had to write it. Im sorry he did, and Im sorry I had to read it.<br /><br />By the way, if he is really going to skip Christmas, why not go the week or two before? Thats when the craziness is the worst. A story of spending Christmas on a cruise ship could actually have been a very interesting one.
0374531269|2.0|An interesting story, but child soldiers fighting for the side of the government seem a lot less interesting than those fighting on the sides of the rebels.<br /><br />Here, although there were some harrowing, even blood curling incidents, they were spaced out far enough that there was a lot of empty space, both in the story and in the logic of the narrative.<br /><br />There was a lot of walking along isolated roads that led to nowhere and a lot of sleeping in the woods along those roads to nowhere. There was no sense of cohesion to this war story. Having read other books on child soldiers, I was disappointed in this one. I was looking for a lot more.<br /><br />Two stars
0316035904|5.0|This book is an acerbic look at Christmas through stories that might be true to some extent. The story of parents at Macy's not wanting to send their children to the \\"chocolate\\" Santa captures so much of how Christmas can really pan out. The fact it's narrated by a man working as an elf makes it all the richer & funnier. The parody of those annoying letters people stick in Christmas cards progresses from ridiculous to unbelievably ridiculous. This would be the best gift for anyone with a good sense of humor who tires of Christmas hype and sentimentality of the Folgers tv commercial variety. I strongly strongly recommend the audiobook version of this book. Nothing will take the sting out of drives for holiday shopping or visits as much as it will.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend buying this DVD.  If you haven't watched even 1 episode, still buy it.  You'll get hooked, guaranteed!  You'll never want it to end!  The acting and story lines are great they make it seem like their world could actually exist! AMAZING SHOW!!!
B001FB4W0W|2.0|This is the first time, that I'm disapointed about an HBO series. I liked The Sopranos, Deadwood and Band Of Brothers. All \\"grownup\\" shows and kind of revolutionary for the TV audience. I had high expectations in True Blood, but the result was a boring soap opera, disguised in a vampire story and filled with a lot of sex scenes, wich are mostly unnecessary. The show has interesting moments, but you've seen most of it on your ordinary TV-Show at every other channel.  Too bad...
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I don't think there's a need to compare this to the original; both in fact are good.  I know it doesn't follow the original story - but I didn't care one bit.  I really love the visuals of this version.  My grandchildren (3, 5, & 8 yrs old) didn't even BLINK during the entire movie, for fear they'd miss something.  Now THAT speaks volumes!  Great job - well done, very entertaining indeed. I HIGHLY recommend this one.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|OK i see loots of people crying and bit... about the film Heath Ledger and how Joker is scary and shes afraid to watch oh my good Nob.  Cut the crap and let's do a review.    First of All Video:    I have seen better video but i must tell you the blacks in this movie are superb that makes the whole movie watchable because no matter how black it is is still watchable and it just makes you wait whats the next scene going to be.  The movie shifts between 2.4:1 and 1.78:1 to compensate for the scenes shot in IMAX but let me tell you probably most of you didn't even notice until you read this, and its understandable because the transition between 2.4:1 and 1.78:1 its smooth. for those with Projector will be more visible and i would say Video 9/10    Audio:   This is the part that will make me watch the movie again and again and again, now for most of you that do not have a decent sound/surround system whatever i say here would not make a difference and let me tell you you are missing a movie.    Let me start by saying from the begging to the end i enjoyed every second of it, the sound is so good that for every scene i was thinking that was the best scene until the scene where the hospital blows, the scene with trucks etc....i must say in long long time i haven't enjoyed the movie more than this.    I recommend to home theater enthusiast to buy the ButtKicker BKA300 for $299 now it will not replace the subwoofer but this blends with the subwoofer and the experience on dark room is unbelievable i had my sister watch the movie for 5 minutes and she was speechless, she could not believe that Buttkicker will add so much to the movie. Anyway for you who have surround sound be careful with the sub the Movie works the Sub to the limit Please be careful. i would like to give sound 10 but it was on 48khz instead of 24khz not that my ears would know the difference but it's just would be better for my eyes to see 24 so saying that i would give 9/10 oo maybe in other words 9.99/10I will add this same review to the buttkicker because that made the movie rock.    I have watched the movie on Blue ray Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1  My rest of the setup is below.    My equipment is:  Fronts: Mirage OMD 15  Center Mirage OMD C1  Rear: Mirage FS2  Subwoofer: Mirage Prestige 8    Buttkicker: ButtKicker BKA300     Receiver Pioneer Elite 92  TV Samsung 750 52inq  PS3 : for Blue ray Audio Source PCM.    If you have any question i would be more than happy to answer you my email is [...]    Thank you.
0201633612|4.0|I don't know if there is a better book on Design Pattern than this book written by the Gang of Four. I used this book in my Undergraduate life and after that I sold it, but Last year I bought it back again. Since its written long time ago the examples are written in C++ but I use Java for almost for all my development and haven't had any problem on translating the knowledge and applying it. I also recommend Design Patterns book by Head First along with this. Because it has more Java base implementation on Design patterns.
0563486430|5.0|Of all the authors I've read from the recent 9th & 10th Doctor Who series, Jac Rayner hits the nail on the head with her writing of the Doctor, Rose, Jackie & Mickie. She really captures their characters and reading this book puts me right into the story just like I'm watching the awesome BBC TV series!
0956010903|5.0|This is a really amazing book and keepsake.  I read another review and someone had stated they were disappointed it wasn't made better.  That's crazy.  CRAZY.  The book shaped box is amazing.  It's covered in something that feels like real leather.  If you didn't inspect the book you'd assume it was a real book.  Feels amazing and all the gold lettering on the spine is very well done.  You open the book (the cover fits snuggly and won't flop open) and there is this red velvety bag and black felt lining.  The actual book is just perfect from the brown leather to all the fancy metal work.  There's not a hint of stray glue or cheapness anywhere.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B00000J2SO|5.0|With the addition of Graham Bonnet, Rainbow went from the l58O's with Ronnie James Dio to the l98O's.  From out of a castle in the English moors to the Sunset Strip.       The only flaw on the album is ''Love's No Friend''.  A feeble attempt of a power ballad, but the rest of the album deserves it's place amongst other Blackmore masterpieces like Machine Head, Burn, RB's Rainbow, and Straight Between The Eyes.    ''Eyes 0f The World'', ''Making Love'', No Time To Lose'' are tasty little tid bits that can have you subconciously driving your car well above the speed limit, while the finale ''Lost ln Hollywood'' leaves you asking for the license plate of the truck that hit you.      Unfortunately this was the only offering that Graham did with Rainbow, although an unreleased song ''Bad Girl'' showed up on Finyl Vinyl a few years later.    Even though this album is called Down To Earth, it will take you to another stratosphere.
031606792X|3.0|No, this was not my favorite book of the series.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending... I wasn't terribly thrilled with Bella being pregnant and nearly dying because of her child.  I wasn't thrilled with the idea of chapters from Jacobs point of view.    Having said that..... I did find this to be a fun, quick (despite it being over 700 pages long) read, and I will definetly read it, and the rest of the Twilight series in the future.  I'm glad that I didn't skip the Jacob chapters like so many others did.  It helped to build his character so much, and make me resent him less than I did in the other books.  And Bella having a baby... really not as big of a deal as everyone wants to make it out to be.  I think that by letting Bella and Edward have a baby together, Stephenie Meyers gave Bella the best of both worlds.  She got to be immortal, but still got to experience a great portion of what makes life for a woman so great!   I loved getting to see vampire-hood from Bellas perspective.. even if she did seem to have it way to easy.    Still think the ending was a bit cheap, but it does leave it open for more stories... so who knows.  Maybe it will be good.
B001I0Z43Y|3.0|I got this product with high hopes to use with the sony hdr-cx12 camcorder.  after some fighting between formatting the cr-5400 with 2x8gb sdhc memory, the camcorder finally recognizes the memory card and will capture to the device. unfortunately, it would give me inconsistent results, therefore i'm now hoping to return the product.      such a let down, but for anyone interested to in having this work with the sony camcorder, i didn't have much luck :(
0916990427|2.0|I bought this book based on the reviews here and I must say I am very disappointed. First of all, its title is misleading. Only part of this book deals with timelines, and even this part is not explained very clearly. I have Master Prac and Hypnotherapy certification and have had some training in timelines. I wanted a book that would be introduce more advanced techniques that I could use for myself and clients. I find most of the stuff introduced here pretty basic, and the introduction of timelines into the fast phobia cure (basic level NLP) seems to just overcomplicate a simple and effective technique. Using timelines to eliminate negative emotions is certainly very useful(though I already knew this stuff). The Swish pattern is certainly not advanced NLP, though useful.    That brings us to halfway through the book. We come then to Chapters 7,8 & 9 which are about travelling in time, being in the present, creating a bright future, and a ridiculous section on a `life well lived' based on the thoughts of Benjamin Franklin. The problem for me with this section is that I found it boring, often stating the obvious, at times featured somewhat flippant pop-psychology, was very poor on specifics, and for the life of me I cannot see the relevance of Franklin - other than to pad out the book. There is nothing here at all on timelines.    The book, written in e-prime, also wanders into Korzybsky and General Semantics, and makes sizeable quotes from Kodish and Kodish's Drive yourself Sane GS book, another book I read on a recommendation and found poorly written and not terribly useful. (Try Robert Anton Wilson on E-Prime, far better explanation and free to Google).     Hall and Bodenhamer's book does have some useful sections, and perhaps can be of use to those with limited NLP knowledge of timelines, and none of General Semantics, but if you want detailed, practical, useful, advanced level TIMELINE information IMHO this is not the book.     The blurb on the back of the book states 'it is a practical book showing how these patterns work and how they can be used for dramatic change in oneself and others'. Erm, no, in my opinion it is more a poorly written, sometimes repetitious, rambling book that tries to philosophise about 'time', and only about one fifth has NLP timeline information, and this rather vagely presented.    At very least try and have a look through it rather than buy blindly as I did. Caveat Emptor.
B00097A5HW|2.0|Yo estaba esperando otra cosa.  Despues que anuncio que planeaba dos discos, uno en espan~ol, y el otro en ingles, yo esperaba que el disco en espan~ol hubiese traido unas gran influencias latinas.  Estuve muy equivocado.<br /><br />Con excepcion de \\"La Tortura\\", en ritmo de reggaeton, suena mas como la musica de artistas como Coldplay, pero cantado por Shakira.  Y hablando de Coldplay, se copiaron de su tocar de piano.  Si el nombre del productor, Rick Rubin, y los musicos que no me acuerdo sus nombre ahora, no suenan latinos, menos latino sono su estilo de tocar la musica.<br /><br />Obviamente le gusto a mucha gente le gusto y estoy en la minoria.  Pero si crees que escucharas un poco de instrumentacion latina como la trompeta Mejicana de \\"Ciego Sordomuda\\" o los instrumentos de viento andinos en \\"Suerte\\" te equivocaras.

I also recommend The Immaculate Collection as well. Buy this cd today!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|The creation story is already a legend.<br /><br />As winter descended, Justin Vernon moved to his father's cabin in the woods of Northwestern Wisconsin. He was \\"60 miles away from anyone I love, sometimes more like 1500.\\" But he was \\"about 18 feet away from everything I love\\" --- a pile of old guitars, a mound of microphones, wires, chords, electric boxes. For several months, he dug in, chopping wood, thinking, writing, playing, recording. When he emerged, he had nine songs, about 35 minutes of music.<br /><br />He smartly added a bit of production here, some backup there, and let the music breathe. Overnight, a cult formed. Now he and his two-man band are known as Bon Iver --- a play on the French for \\"good winter\\" --- and his debut CD is on all the best iPods.<br /><br />The creation story hasn't hurt. But this is one time an ascent is almost totally because of the musical achievement. Here's Vernon's take:<br /><br />\\"It's been painted in the reviews of the record as this magical four months of hunkering down and writing a record. In reality I headed out to the cabin because I just didn't know what to do next in my life. Once I got there though it just felt like all the blocks that I had put in my brain and heart in terms of musical expression started to loosen. They had been there for so long and the only thing that was able to loosen them up, and loosen me up, was having that much space....\\"<br /><br />Space, as it turns out, is the glory of \\"For Emma\\". The lyrics are sparse and enigmatic --- the opening lines of the CD are \\"I am my mother's only one/It's enough\\" --- and sometimes they're more sounds than words. The music will strike prissy listeners as mere strumming. If there's a clear gift here, it's Vernon's voice --- he can go falsetto so fast and true that even Neil Young has to bow.<br /><br />The triumph lies in Vernon's ability to bring you to the very gates of mystery. He not only explores inner space, he creates it. You'll experience open fields, open hearts, what Vernon calls in one song \\"the sound of the unlocking and the lift away\\". In its small size lies its vast power. And more: It makes you feel peaceful.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|I hadn't heard much about Wall-E going into it which was great because it turned out to be very different then what i was expecting, in a good way.  I'm not a huge fan of Pixar, but they did a great job on this one.  I don't want to give any of the story away, just rest assured, if you're in the mood for a fun movie this one has something for kids and adults alike.  My only complaint doesn't have to do with the actual movie at all but the packaging it comes in, on the box it claims to be environmental friendly packaging, but what common sense tells you is that Disney is just being cheap.  It's not your standard dvd case, it's more of a cardboard foldout.  Again, this is a minor complaint, the important part about what you're buying is the actual movie and that's top notch.  Give it a try whether you buy it or rent it, see it and enjoy!    ***I haven't seen the dvd extra's yet, i'll update this review once i do***

0316017922|4.0|Gladwell says that this book looks at the ways in which success is governed by the culture the succeedor comes from.  But the overall impression one gets after reading the book is that it is a long argument for the value of hard work in certain limited fields. Yes, Gladwell does say that his \\"outliers\\" like Bill Gates and Bill Joy had extraordinary opportunities and luck that other people didn't have; but none of that opportunity and luck would have done them any good if they hadn't been willing to work very long hours at programming, in order to become the best programmers in the world.  The same goes for hockey players and the Beatles and Chinese math students.    This paean to hard work didn't start to bother me until he got to the chapter about the KIPP schools.  In that chapter he tells the story of a little girl, ten years old, who gets up at 5:30 to ride the bus to her KIPP school, and then comes home to do homework until 11 pm or even midnight. She is often very tired and falls asleep at school.  He says that the KIPP schools are giving her an extraordinary opportunity to pull herself out of poverty. But it is not healthy for any child to be working such long hours.  It's hard for me to feel very wonderful about this \\"opportunity\\" which may be damaging to the child's longterm health.    The irony is that the first chapter of the book IS about health:  about a community of Italian immigrants who achieve amazingly good health simply by living in a close-knit community.  But this obsession with constant working does not build community and health:  it sometimes results in \\"outliers\\", people who achieve at a level way  beyond other people, but it also makes the rest of us ordinary people into unhealthy, isolated workaholics with no personal life.    Gladwell talks about the 10,000 hour rule: the observation that it takes 10,000 hours of doing something to get really good at it, or about ten years of working 20 hours a week at something.  By that standard, I should be an \\"outlier\\" when it comes to child care.  But since most moms spend at least that number of hours caring for our children, we are NOT outliers:  we are just normal, hard-working moms. If we had been playing the violin instead, Gladwell implies, we'd be recognized as over-achievers, people who are really good at something impressive. Instead, we're just moms, people who did what was expected and required.    So, the moral of the story is:  don't spend 10,000 hours doing something that nobody values. Spend it programming computers, working on hostile takeovers, playing rock music in strip clubs, or playing really aggressive hockey.  In other words, do stuff that guys do. Don't spend 10,000 hours cleaning houses, taking care of little kids, or writing poetry. Nobody will care; Gladwell won't interview you; and you won't be one of the richest people in the world. In fact, the shadowy underside of his outliers is that they had to have other people do all those thousands of hours of low-paid, low status work in order to get where they are today. Who raises Bill Gates's kids?  Who irons his shirts?  Who cooks his food?  Who mows his lawns?  I bet they've spend thousands of hours doing those things, and I bet they're really good at those things, but they're not outliers:  they're ordinary working people.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|I love jazz, have listened to it for 40 years, go to a few concerts each year, and have a huge jazz collection.  I really go by one thing when I am listening to jazz: \\"Do I enjoy the music?\\"  Roy Hargrove's album, earfood, is a very enjoyable album.  It is straight ahead Jazz with a bit of a Gospel feel.  The final cut, \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" is terrific.  I have been only somewhat familiar with Hargrove in the past, but this album has led me to go back and pick up some of his earlier albums.  If you are wanting a wonderful fresh new jazz album to add to your collection or just wanting to pick up a jazz album for the first time, you can't go wrong with earfood!
B001DPC52C|4.0|It makes sense that Within Temptation, self-described as a symphonic rock band, would want to play with an actual symphony one day.  They got their wish this past February, when they teamed up with the Dutch Metropole Orchestra and Pa'Dam Choir in front of 10,000 hometown fans in Rotterdam, Holland in a show dubbed \\"Black Symphony.\\"    The result?  Very well done.  Some have complained that many of the songs sound too much like their records but the orchestra adds nuances that you can't hear on their records.  The CD pretty much just gives you the hits, but the DVD is much longer and gives a great overview of WT's career.  The focus of WT, as always, is lead singer Sharon den Adel, who commands the stage (and changes costumes frequently, but what girl doesn't like to play dress-up?).  However, her voice is strained-sounding at times--she states in the DVD behind-the-scenes that she was sick a few days before the show--and she is forced to go lower on songs like \\"The Howling,\\" but she still sounds ethereal.  A note to a reviewer who thought Tarja Turunen (formerly of Nightwish) is a better live singer than Sharon--she is HORRID live, frequently off-key or screeching instead of singing.  Sharon's voice may not be as strong but she hits every note and a few you don't expect.  Saying that, though she might have wanted to rethink her duet of \\"Somewhere\\" with Anneke van Giersbergen (formerly of the Gathering) because Anneke is a stronger and better singer and basically steals the song, although Sharon does lovely harmonies.  The sound and picture quality are terrific and if you have surround sound use it because everything's crystal clear.      For those of us stateside who have only ever seen WT in clubs or small venues, \\"Black Symphony\\" proves that WT with or without an orchestra can rock an arena.  Fans will love it and if you play your cards right you can convert people with this.
B001I189MQ|5.0|This movie has it all, story, acting, cinematography, special effects, etc. Unfortunately because it is not stuffy enough it is likely that a movie that is this great will be overlooked come Oscar time. I really hope I am wrong but I really don't think that The Academy is ready for a comic-book flick to be a member of the Best Movie nominee club let alone the winners.      Enough ranting. This movie gave me chills in the first 60 seconds when I saw it in IMAX. The sound goes through you and serves as an additional visceral component to the movie which even on a 20\\" TV with dumb old stereo sound would still jump off the screen.     The story is both scary and inspiring. The actors found that special place where the actor becomes the character and transcends the limitations that most comic-book flicks battle.     I really would love to see The Academy step out of the box and consider this film.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This was the last movie we bought on VHS.  We quote this movie so often that we finally had to buy the DVD.  This is a great role for Ben Stiller, just as famous as his role in Dodge-ball.  Owen Wilson rocks the screen as well.  Zoolander is a must see for anyone who can appreciate wacky humor.  And don't just watch it once...it gets funnier every time.  You actually catch things you didn't get the first time.  Definitely a favorite in our household of kooks!!

What does it matter that the box says what it is, you should have known that if you've ever pre-ordered any other Harry Potter book, they always say that, or that J.K. doesn't know human anatomy, they're not meant to be accurate, they're drawings meant for a wizarding world's children's book, not a college anatomy textbook.    This book is a piece of the story that we've come to know and love, now we can reach into \\"Deathly Hallows\\" and feel, touch, and read what Harry, Hermione, and Ron read during the last days of the war against Voldemort.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|Indy IV was hyped for close to a decade, going through various screenplay rewrites and writers, Indy was put on hold numerous times, rescheduled and then finally announced, the story kept shrouded in mystery. Then Indy IV was eventually released to only mediocre reception but thankfully still has some of the original flare to save it from absolute failure. The truth is that Indy IV comes very close to not only being the worst of the four Indy movies, but a low point for Spielberg in general. In short, The Temple of Doom is better than this. So what went wrong and what saves it?<br /><br />It suffers a bit from Phantom Menace syndrome. The decade long hype nowhere nears pays-off and neither does the secrecy. It is not an original story. In short it looks taken from an Erik Von Daniken chapter on `ancient aliens' combined with X Files: The Movie and maybe even `Predator'. All of the other hyped proposals, Atlantis etc., sounded a way better and probably would have been. So the story is maybe a letdown.  Then we have the bad guys, pesky Russians. This is the 21st century and that is the best we can do? The Russians? Okay so maybe it's keeping in tune with typical Indy stereotype bad-guys but it just doesn't pack the same kind of punch that it would have done say in 1980, but in 2008 it is positively lame. Then we have the new kid who does a lot of Indy's fighting for him. Okay so Harrison is old, but he is not that old and this is an Indy picture and really this is what saves the day... Indy.<br /><br />Harrison doing Indy hasn't changed and that is what rescues this film. He hasn't changed one bit, not one iota, even though he might look older, he has all the moves, one-liners, facial expressions and kicks. Whenever Indy is on the screen, Indy IV is great. Also Indy IV is heavy on archaeology and that gives it an edge that maybe Temple lacked. The action sequences are not bad although there are some questionable graphics during the jungle fight. At least Indy IV gets right into the action within the first few minutes and continues right through to the end. There is also a classic gag with a snake.<br /><br />So all in all, Indy IV is only ok, it is watchable, but for people who have invested in this series (and who hasn't) or followed the hype with anticipation will wonder what has gone wrong with the kind of mentally stimulating exciting movies that Spielberg and Lucas once had going. It almost paves the way for the new generation directors to make the most out of the missing blockbusters. Yet again thinking of 2008, they have haven't they?... and that's the point. Maybe we have been spoiled by better films and better Indy's, some of them by the director/producer duo that brought us this, but at the same time I cannot see the 1 or 2 star reviews being wrong about this motion picture. I am being generious with 3. It is kinda sad too thinking that there will probably not be another one. It feels like the end of an era.action within the first few minutes and continues right through to the end. There is also a classic gag with a snake.

B00003CXDV|5.0|This film is high concept comedy that comes through with lots of friendly joyful moments and genuine good feelings in what is a cracking entertaining story. Basically this takes the concept of Star Trek (ST) and ports it over to Galaxy Quest, a cheesy version of ST on a lower budget, where after the show has been cancelled and years later the crew find themselves earning a mediocre living at conventions and fan clubs and at the same time falling apart as a group because their leader won't take the conventions seriously plus they are having some relationship issues. Suddenly things change when an alien race hijacks the actors, thinking they are really heroes who have engaged and won great battles based on historical documents (intercepted television transmissions of their television show) and ask the actors to save them from an evil galactic villain. It turns out to be much more enjoyable than what a comedy like this usually ought to be and just steals your heart throughout even when it is being corny. If you haven't seen it, then watch it. Galaxy Quest could be one of the funniest family orientated films of all time. If only most comedies where this good.

031606792X|1.0|Having read the first three books and recieving some level of entertainment from them, I decided to continue and picked up Breaking Dawn.    I found that every element of it seemed like the FanFiction writing of an immature 14 year old fan girl, complete with the cliched Crack story lines of \\"main characters get married\\" \\"girl gets pregnant\\" and ultimately, \\"everyone gets a completely uncharacteristic happy ending\\".    From an even more devolved writing style, predictable(at best) plot twists, majorly gripping conflict, the annoying and rediculous names for supporting characters, and a very unrealistic and poor interpretation of a loving adult relationship everything about the fourth book of Stephanie Meyer's series insults her reader's intellegence, even if her most promenant demographic is tweens and emotionally stunted teenage girls.
B0004Z33F0|3.0|John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) goes to Afghanistan to pull his mentor Col. Trautman's (Richard Crenna) fat out of the fire after he is captured by the Russians.  That's all there is to the plot.  The action is better than Part II and it doesn't display that film's distasteful disregard for the lives of foreign noncombatants, so at least it's a step up from that execrable flick, though neither of them holds a candle to the genuinely enjoyable first film.  Sure, it's ridiculous and retarded, but if that's what you're in the mood for, you've come to the right movie.

1589944607|5.0|Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is one of the rare games that successfully marries theme (a licensed theme, no less) and gameplay.<br /><br />Players each choose a character from the cast of the television series. Each player, on his or her turn:<br /><br />1. Draws skill cards (which double as action cards),<br />2. Optionally moves to location on Galactica (or Colonial One, or, as a pilot, through the space around Galactica),<br />3. Activates a location or plays an action on a card (or, as a pilot in a Viper, moves again or fires at Cyclon raiders and basestars in order to protect the human fleet),<br />4. Draws and resolves a Crisis Card.<br /><br />Most crisis cards depict a distressing event (with art and text from the television series), be it a food shortage or a lost scouting party, and offer a choice and/or a skill check to be made to minimize the damage to Galactica or her resources. Skill checks are resolved by players secretly contributing positive (matching color/type) or negative (incorrect color/type) skill cards. In addition, many of these crisis cards also activate enemy ships or move the Galactica closer to making its next jump.<br /><br />But all that would just make for a typical cooperative game. Each player also receives a secret loyalty card that indicates whether they are a treacherous Cylon (skinjob) or a human. The humans attempt to survive the journey to Kobol (by making jumps that total at least eight units, plus one additional jump to end the game) whereas the Cylons do their best to sabatoge the human effort, either covertly (which involves a great deal of bluffing and secretly tipping the scales via secretly played cards) or overtly (by revealing themselves as Cylons and just hammering at the Galactica with all the tools a revealed Cylon has). Furthermore, halfway through the game another set of loyalty cards is dealt, such that there are a total of two Cyclon players (in a five player game; the number of Cylons and sympathizersvaries based on the number of players). In this way, the game captures the feeling of paranoia that characterizes the source material.<br /><br />With accusations flying about and choices constantly being made, BSG is a strong interactive game that really shines. Admittedly, it does run a little long (three to four hours for the first game and around half that once everyone knows how to play), but once the first few rounds have passed, the pace of the game really picks up, as do player involvement and suspicion. BSG is, without a doubt, the reviewer's favorite cooperative board game (compared to Shadows Over Camelot, Arkham Horror, Last Night on Earth, Pandemic, and A Touch of Evil, as well as faux-cooperative games such as Cutthroat Caverns) and, moreover, one of his favorite board games, period. BSG should be well received amongst fans of American-style board games as well as fans of Battlestar Galactica television series.<br /><br />P.S.: Prospective owners need not worry about the game spoiling the series for those who haven't seen the show. The game makes only oblique references to the events of the series (and even those are limited to the first two seasons). In fact, the greatest spoilers may very well be the line of succession for each of the positions of Admiral (that rank being a minor spoiler in and of itself) and President.

Still, check it out if you haven't seen it, and judge for yourself.<br /><br />ADDENDUM ( 6/27/14)<br />i'll be the first to admit when I'm wrong about something. My first rating for this film was two stars. **. Now that I've seen the film three more times, and in the context of Christopher Nolan's entire trilogy, I can appreciate it much more. I still find Heath Ledger's  rendition of the Joker to be way too evil , bordering on Satanic. I understand that's the way of the media right now. Comic book superheroes are now much more serious (\\"Why soooo serious?\\") and intense, with little or no room for any moments of humor. I guess it makes the story better, but I find little or no sense of \\"fun\\" in these films anymore.  All this being said, I can't deny the superb abilities of Christopher Nolan as a writer and director in the series. After this trilogy, and THE PRESTIGE and INCEPTION, I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.
0393330435|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am not an Apple fanatic. I started out an an Apple II way made in high school, but never really got hooked on them. I was a Tandy user for the most part. Maybe it was the price. Maybe it was the fact I could ride my bike to Radio Shack and play with them, whatever the reason, I still don't own any Apple products, but that might change as I decide between the iPhone and the Blackberry.<br /><br />iWoz is the story of Steve Wozniak, engineer, teacher, inventor of the personal computer, pilot, and co-founder of Apple Inc. Personally, I have a hard time with just the title of the book. iWoz, how original along side iCon (Steve Jobs book), iPod, iMac, iPhone, and iDon't Get It, all I can think of is I Robot. Is that a bad thing?<br /><br />iWoz is written by Steve from his point of view. And his point is often much more interesting than conventional history would have you think. The book follows Woz from his early childhood with an engineer father, through young adulthood, and through on to current day Woz. Along the way he expresses himself with humility and candor, something I found refreshing when compared to some of the very dry Apple histories.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is seeing how, through his whole life, he just wanted to be an engineer. Everything else was simply extra and he was quite content to make great electronics, and maybe play a practical joke along the way. Woz also sets a few things that are considered Apple lore straight as he saw them. Woz's skills as a teacher are seen clearly as, along with Gina Smith, he takes some of the most complex events in computer history and presents them in a way that is easy to understand.<br /><br />iWoz is more than a fanboy book, it's a great read about a time in computer history that it seems fewer and fewer people truly understand.

Much of the advice stems from the notion that understanding the interests of all parties is decisive; and the book focuses primarily on the various aspects of this methodology.<br /><br />There are other books on the topic that incorporate a far more comprehensive examination, provide more samples, or even delve deeper into the psychology of persuasion; however, I have no doubt that if you are seeking to improve your negotiation abilities that this book will be a benefit to you.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|I admit that I am a life-long Abba fan (owning still all the original vinyl, a few 8 tracks, most of the earliest posters, etc.). I also have to admit that Tom Hanks' and Rita Wilson's movie version of the Broadway musical hit \\"Mamma Mia\\" (2008) is, well, disappointing. (Their chance to \\"clean up\\" this potentially fun musical is now lost.)<br /><br />Benny's & Bjorn's music score happily resonates from the stage into this Greek isle flick (in deed, original Abba tunes and singing nicely underscore the entire movie background music). For the Abba-fanatics it is about their music!<br /><br />The acting and singing, however, leave much to be desired. Everyone, except maybe the movie producers, knows that Abba music is best sung by female sopranos. Pierce Brosnan's tenor is higher than Meryl Streep's alto (together they butcher the classics from Agnetta and Frida!). Although James Bond (Brosnan's 55) may fit as Sophie's (well played by Amanda Seyfried) dad (better as granddad), Streep is totally miscast as Donna the mom (her grandma look-a-like jumps about like no other 59 year old can!). Lloyd's direction isn't up to par either- often actor heads bounce off the tops of the screen and sideways, out of view, as the camera can't keep up with chorographic telemetry.<br /><br />The Greek isle and Mediterranean present a fairy tale ambiance, but this movie is not oriented for the family. Alcohol, sexuality, provocative innuendo, questionable language, fleshy dancing, and mature \\"comedy\\" all flow here (oddly, with all the other nasties going on in this movie, the final credits proffer an apology only for a very minor reference to tobacco- one brief unlit stogie).<br /><br />This Hollywood flick's licentiousness is a far cry from Abba's original music that scores sing along words, images of mutual respect, flirtive romance, and fun spandex. \\"Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find...\\" in this screen play.<br /><br />Abba purists will find this movie limiting and possibly unattractive. No recommendation is made to those considering watching this flick other than to take Donna the mom's advice in an early scene, \\"Don't think about it\\".ation is made to those considering watching this flick other than to take Donna the mom's advice in an early scene, \\"Don't think about it\\".

From page one you'll be grabbed by a mystery that must be solved. I usually are more of the fantasy-type of books but this one really charmed me.   It has some very exciting scenes and every chapter is tied up with adrenaline-filled cliff hangers. Some parts are hard to go through if you get easily distracted but then the action grabs you again and won't let you go. If you are reluctant about spy novels, read this one and you'll see it's a whole new world full of interesting plots. Can't wait to start reading Point Blank!

You can hear every blast and jet propulsion sound coming from the suit when Iron Man is flying.  My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.  Turn the volume way up and hear the surround sound go from one side of the room to the other as Iron Man and the jets fly by.  I love it.  Simply amazing.  One of the better movies in Blu Ray.        All the special features, BD live plus a digital copy to watch on your iPhone/iPod makes this a great deal!
158799190X|5.0|Most of the ideas presented in the book are deadright. Being a lover of Mathematics and I think its almost a necessary condition to understand the points of the book, I have realised many of these points personally. What surprises me is that many well educated guys from science/ engineering simply do not understand simple things of maths in real life. I have friends who swear by Buffet and believe, inspite of getting it wrong on so many occations, that there is a thing called \\"Absolute Winning Strategy\\". By first principles, I am reminded of my Finance Professor at a Business Program \\" Future is Uncertain\\" So how can there be an \\"Absolute Winning Strategy for future\\"?
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark knight was one amazing film. imo it is the best of 2008! the blu ray version of the movie is outstanding. All of the imax scenes are by far the best pq i have ever seen on a blu ray. Not to mention the rest of the film looks great as well! The sound is crisp and clear. All in all this is one enjoyable blu ray. Also if you're a fan of the Dark Knight and do not have a blu ray player i would highly recommend looking into buying one just for this movie.
0307269752|5.0|If you've gotten this far in your quest for information regarding Stieg Larson's book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" you probably already know it is an international best-seller, and a developing blockbuster, you may have seen it displayed in the brick and mortar book stores, and you may already have some inkling that someone in Hollywood is working on a screenplay.<br /><br />Just let me say this:  If you like mystery, intrigue, and mayhem, with the ever-so-slight possibility that the situation the protagonist has landed in isn't going to get better; if you enjoy characters developed to perfection; and a plot so intelligently crafted that you are turning pages late at night, then you simply have to read this book.<br /><br />Do not wait for the movie, that will no doubt feature Uma Thurman as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, buy the book today and fasten your seat belt `cause it's going to be a roller coaster ride like no other.
1400031567|2.0|Frankly, I just don't see it.  There are two major problems with this book: the first is that you know who the killer is pretty much at the outset, and that drains most of the suspense from the book.  That leads to the second problem: the police officer at the center of the novel is, it seems to me, not very good.  He misses a lot of obvious stuff.  Oddly, where the novel covers a lot of the everyday details of the man's life during the investigation (lack of sleep, spilling ink on his shirt), it gives short shrift to the actual investigation.  (For instance, it isn't clear that the police bothered to interview the neighbors of a murder victim until much later).  The detective comes off as not very bright, and that's not what you want in a mystery.  I was happy to end the book.

0385340990|5.0|This book was loaned to me as a \\"must read\\" and I was reluctant to do so because I already had an entire bookshelf waiting to be read. I am so glad that I took the trouble to start the book because I was hooked within a couple of pages. This is a series of letters between people of totally different educational backgrounds and the letters reflect that perfectly. It was an entertaining and sometimes touching experience to follow the stories of these fictional characters.
B000063JZQ|2.0|Mr. Yochum's Senior English Class      I think that  this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations.  I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This was purchased without having heard any of the tracks as I am a big Madonna fan and have loved her music throughout the decades.  However, I was in for a big surprise after listening thoroughly to this album.<br /><br />The style is far from any of her previous material and seems to have been heavily influenced by contributing artist Justin Timberlake.  Those having heard Timberlake's material and not having liked it will probably not like this album.  I realize that this may not apply to everyone.<br /><br />However, if you are buying album expecting it to be like previous material released by Madonna, take a listen first before buying.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|The movie speaks for itself, but as a Blu-ray disc, this purchase disappoints.  The hi-def transfer is inferior to most, and no effort was made to create the usual smooth-navigating Blu-ray menus.  The disc navigates like a standard DVD, with pauses in between menus and the same minimalist set-up.  If you own the DVD, it is not worth $10 (or more) to add this Blu-ray disc to your collection.  The DVDs provide similar quality and features, (if not more, considering the only movie version provided on the Blu-ray is the theatrical).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you've never heard of firefly... buy it. watch it.<br />If you didn't like firefly... you have no taste and no imagination.<br /><br />This sci-fi show has three dimensional down-to-earth characters and a fantastic plot.  Compared to this, Buffy was practice.  Joss Whedon's great concept was cut tragically short by a network that (we hope) is kicking itself at the moment.  The firefly series is only four discs.  The persistent fans got us a movie, Serenity, so we could finally say good-bye.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|\\"Brick\\" is an edgy, roughly cut film, shot on a shoestring.  Director Rian Johnson's next film \\"The Brothers Bloom\\" is due out early next year & has Nora Zehetner who played Laura & Noah Segum who played Dode.  Johnson's screenplay won awards from Central Ohio Film Critics Association and San Francisco Film Critics Circle.  Johnson was nominated as a promising director by the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and by the Sitges-Catalonian International Film Festival.  The film won a special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt was excellent in both [[ASIN:B0013FSL1Q Stop-Loss]] & [[ASIN:B000F6II1M Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)]].  For those of us who laughed hard at TV's \\"Third Rock from the Sun,\\" it's wonderful to see his growth as an actor, perhaps poised to become a major star with the right film.  As Brendan, he carried his love on his sleeve as he seeks to find out the truth behind his girlfriend's murder.  He is unable to turn off his feelings or abandon his search, despite the fact that she broke up with him & apparently did not love him.<br /><br />Norh Zehetner plays Laura, a wealthy high school student, invited to the right parties.  She goes with a football star to enhance her status.  She is more than two-faced.  As Rian Johnson creates the role, we are always interested to see what face will next emerge.<br /><br />Lukas Haas plays the Pin, a small-time drug dealer with his own student criminal organization.  The guy's looks are so odd with a cane and crazy hairstyle, that Haas' very minimal controlled acting style seems almost at odds with the dialogue.  It is a very interesting performance and treatment of the character.<br /><br />Noah Fleiss turns in an excellent performance as Tugger.  He becomes more prominent as the film unravels.  His hair-trigger temper explodes repeatedly at a moment's provocation.  Fleiss seems to perfect this repeated assault.<br /><br />Matt O'Leary who was in a film I didn't happen to care for titled [[ASIN:B00006AUJR Frailty]] plays the Brain.  His character supports Brendan as his backup and support.  One of the flaws I found with the script was the lack of integration of the Brain to the plot.  I had no idea why he and Brendan were so cooperative.  The final scene on the football field made the relationship even more nebulous.  I found myself wondering if the film would have been tighter had his character been written out.  That said, O'Leary certainly seemed every part the brainy nerd masking a whole other world of experience.<br /><br />Emile de Ravin played Tess on a favorite TV show of mine, \\"Roswell.\\"  She has also played Claire Littleton on TV's \\"Lost.\\"  I found the plastic blue bracelets that hang limp in the water on the DVD front cover to echo a cheapness to which her character Emily aspires.  De Ravin brings complexity to the role's limited screen time.<br /><br />Noah Segun plays the dimwitted, thick-headed boyfriend of Emily.  I found it interesting to watch his screentest in the DVD extras, very minimal acting, but well in character throughout.  As Dode, Segun brings a childlike charm to a goth exterior.  He looked better in the screentest, which is probably Johnson's point.<br /><br />Richard Roundtree plays Assistant Vice Principal Trueman in a great cameo.  His banter with Brendan is as bouncy as ping-pong match.  Meagan Good has nice moments as Kara, a stage chanteuse who enjoys Asian makeup.<br /><br />In the beginning of the film, I found the fast-paced language incomprehensible much of the time.  I kept asking myself, \\"What'd they say?\\"  Even when I rewound to get what they said, I still had no clue what it meant.  As the film unwinds, we acclimate to a hip lingo that is often a cool shorthand that provides the missing pieces of the puzzle.  I liked the very practical commentary by Rian Johnson in the DVD extras.  For example, he talks about having to re-shoot the final football field scene with Brendan and Laura, but having to shoot their faces from the ground up to mask the changes that had been made to green the football field.  I enjoyed the film, appreciating how Johnson gives free reign to his supporting characters to shine.  This is worth an evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!to mask the changes that had been made to green the football field.  I enjoyed the film, appreciating how Johnson gives free reign to his supporting characters to shine.

0739367676|5.0|I'm back here looking for the audio version of this book because I miss the characters.  That is how real Stephenie made them.  They are people that I feel like I know and now they are gone after the reading of Breaking Dawn.  It's like when we were little and your cousins would come in for the holidays...how bad you felt when they left to go back home. Well, the Cullens went back home.    Anyway, I was so totally surprised to see negative reviews.  I can't get over it.  I believe Breaking Dawn, is by far, better than the others.  Not that any of them were bad, because they're all good.  How could anyone not love it is beyond me.    I read one review totally going off on the lack of sex scenes.  Hello..this is rated young adults.  Stephenie restrained herself, I'm sure, to keep in that genre.  Wouldn't it be great if she wrote an adult version?  Someone who knows her prod her to do just that.  Another best seller.....    Again, this book is great and will not leave you disappointed IF you enjoyed the others.
B000000OTY|5.0|Spacing his live album releases about a decade apart, Peter Gabriel shows how a major artist can create a gem out of a much too-often used template to toss product into the marketplace with minimal time or effort involved.<br /><br />There is a continuity to  the set - the 15 tracks were recorded on November 16 and 17, 1993, at Palasport Nuovo in Modena, Italy, with the two disks clocking in at an impressive 99:45. There is also an incredible energy in the performances that shows Gabriel at the height (for the U.S. market) of his popularity; the release peaked at a decent #23 on the 1994 Billboard 200 album chart.<br /><br />Gabriel has a special gift as a story teller and his lyrics touch fans in individual ways. This is a solid collection to hear his brilliance before an appreciative audience.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Humans left the uninhabitable earth 700 years ago to live aboard a luxury  space ship.  Left behind was Wall-E, a little robot who endlessly collects trash, compacts it, and neatly stacks the cubes in sky-high stacks.  He finds some interesting things in his job, but every night as he watches the romantic songs from his video of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" he sighs wistfully and wishes he could find someone to love.<br /><br />I wasn't prepared for how moving this wonderful movie would be. The early scenes showing Wall-E painfully alone and longing for love are absolutely heartbreaking.  Happily, love does come in the form of a robot named EVE, sent to earth to detect plant life.  Much of the movie is without dialogue and when it does come, it's very short and very sweet:<br /><br />\\"Eva?\\"<br />\\"Wall-E?\\"<br />\\"EVAAAAA!!\\"<br />\\"WALL-EEEEEEE!!!\\"<br /><br />There's lots of fun and high-speed action aboard the huge spaceship and some guilty insights into the future of mankind (fat, lazy slobs catered to by robots).  With humor, romance, thrills, and above all, a loveable trash-compactor named Wall-E, this is a movie all ages can enjoy. Highly recommended.  (Bring your tissues!)

B000VI70WM|2.0|I won't belabor all the similar opinions, but I have to put my two cents in. Some OK songs here, but those mechanical drum tracks...what were they thinking? They suck the soul right out of some potentially decent songs.  An especially big dissapointment after the surprisingly fab Astronaut.<br /><br />I mean really, Nite-Runner, Skin Divers, and Tempted sound like a couple of amateurs with a drum machine and a computer.  I'd be embarrassed to play this for anyone over 13.<br /><br />Astronaut sounded fresh; moving forward with a new sound.  RCM sounds like going back to the bad stuff of the 80s.<br /><br />Bring back real drums and guitars.

B001I10ABE|5.0|Ive bought all the vinyl reissues so far, and have been pleased with all of them. To the reviewer who gave this 1 star, an album doesnt sell 15 million copies if its that bad. You may not like the commercial aspect, but to deny the impact of this album simply because they went in a different direction is a tad bit ridiculous.  The vinyl is high quality, and the packaging as well.
B00121QGUY|4.0|I was not so impressed with the video quality.  It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy.  Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world.

B0000029DD|4.0|The solemn and elegiacal power of Leonard Cohen's &#34;Hallelujah&#34; is completely transmuted by Jeff Buckley into something achingly, beautifully, broken.  I have to admit that it took years for his interpretation to resonate with me.  But now that it does I am pleased to join the great throng of admirers. I do love how K.D. Lang and John Cale perform this expertly penned poem as well.  The whole of this album is a kind of strange and wonderful thing.
1931559317|5.0|I absolutely love this Sky Atlas! It is by far one of the best astronomical purchases I have made. Naturally after using it for a little bit, you start to memorize which part of the sky is on which page and it becomes even easier to use. Very easy to use under red light and it even displays the Greek Alphabet letters associated with each star (ex. Beta Orionis). Even if you have no observing equipment yet, this will help you learn the sky better than any of those huge books. It's so small you can just turn the book to orient the page with the position of the constellation your looking at. From a fairly seasoned Observer, I highly recommend it!

B000003CMB|5.0|I am a fan of The Allman Brothers, but not one of the \\"die-hard\\" fans who follow them like people follow the Dead, yet without a doubt this record is an essential must have in any collection.    I have seen the band a couple of times live (without Duane) and each concert has been superb in musicianship and performance.  And this record captures it all perfectly in one of the best live recordings ever.    Each player shines on this record and the jams take you along with them for a fabulous ride through rock and improvisation that thrills and enthralls every step of the way without ever feeling long, tedious or self indulgent.  Though all players shine, Allman and Betts on guitar is simply amazing.    As I said, a must have in any collection.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has produced another brilliant thought provoking book. Would we expect anything less from this author? This book follows in the tradition of his other works changing how we look at a topic forever. This time it is success. Why do some people go on to incredible success while the majority just get by. The answers will change forever your thoughts on how you see success and what causes it. The book shows literally how in so many regards the rich get richer and the poor get poorer due to opportunities, parental engagement and environment. It is profoundly reflected in Canada in hockey. Most of the hockey rosters show that half of the teams players are born in January to March. How could this be? Their leagues start in January, so kids born in January are a full year older than the kids that were born in December and just turned the right age to start the season. These larger children end up getting all the attention and training and go on to be all stars. The book explains this phenomenon in detail.<br /> Contrary to common belief being born with a natural ability is almost unheard of. The truth is the truly successful and world class business people, athletes, and musicians have put in at least ten thousand hours of practice before they have achieved a high level of mastery in their chosen field. I see this to be true in the lives of Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Mozart, the Beatles, and many more. Tiger Woods a natural? Then why has he practiced golf since he was 3? Why did Michael Jordan get cut from his high school basketball team before he become more discipline in his game. Mozart did not create masterpiece symphonies until he had his ten thousand hours in. The book explains the success of the Beatles and Mozart through this principle. You will see like I did how the ten thousand hour rule exists in your own life with high performers in your chosen field.<br /> The author also shows the importance of birth date in success. If you had any chance of being an industrial powerhouse then you had to be born around 1835 in the United States for you to be the right age to take advantage of the time in history, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, and fourteen others were all born with four years of this date and the seventeen of them rank in the top 75 wealthiest people to ever live. You had to be born very close to 1955 and have access to a computer before everyone else did, if you were to become a software titan. Bill Gates was born in 1955, Paul Allen 1953, and Steve Jobs 1955.<br /> I love the way the author brought these and many more principles together to truly explain the real anatomy of success. It takes more than just a strong will, outliers benefited from their environment, relationships, country, circumstances, passions, work ethic, and opportunities unique to them. For most of them it took all of the above to be such giants of their time.<br /> \\"[Outliers]... are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances,some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky--but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all\\".an industrial powerhouse then you had to be born around 1835 in the United States for you to be the right age to take advantage of the time in history, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, and fourteen others were all born with four years of this date and the seventeen of them rank in the top 75 wealthiest people to ever live.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|There's been this wonderful trend in Hollywood lately: action movies that don't take themselves seriously.  \\"Shoot 'em Up\\" has been the best so far: a \\"ballet of bullets\\" (I believe I'm borrowing that from the \\"making of\\" featurette) that contained quite a few one-liners, and a whole lot of blood and cheesy effects.  \\"Wanted\\" ups the ante: it's a pure, straight shot of adrenaline right into your heart--a rush of action and effects that is at once horrifyingly cliched and beautifully original.<br /><br />Here's the plot (for those of you paying attention): a mild-mannered accountant finds out he's the son of the world's greatest assassin...and it's up to an unbelievably attractive woman to teach him the ropes, so he can go out in the world and seek his revenge, at the same time saving a fraternity (God I wish they'd used that word a little less!) of professional killers working on the whims of fate.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, and especially James McAvoy hold the film together; they bring a certain style and charisma to the movie that the film couldn't really do without.  The action is quick and fierce--a bullet here, a bullet there, before you even hear the rapport of gunfire.  There is an iota of depth here (a sort of \\"who watches the watchmen\\" kinda thing), but it's meant to be an after thought, a bit of background for the action to take place against.  Who cares if the plot is unbelievably bland?  Who cares if almost every scene defies the laws of physics?  This is Hollywood, baby--live it up while you can!
0739321005|5.0|I had read Obama's book \\"Audacity of Hope\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not feel the need to read this one until I heard on the radio that there was a \\"Book on CD, with Obama himself as the narrator\\".  This was the first Book on CD I've ever heard and what a terrific start.  It's simply fabulous, and in my opinion, a must read for everyone, young or old. Makes me feel really proud to have voted for Obama. There's a lot to learn from this CD. An incredible life journey of a man from very humble beginnings. We should all be so proud that he had such great human beings as his parents and grand parents.  I learnt many lessons on parenting from reading this. This CD should be heard in Middle and High schools.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I have always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and this one did not disappoint.  Gladwell did a thorough analysis on all of the factors that can contribute to one's success that are often overlooked or taken for granted.  Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter.  We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit.  Although the concept presented by this book is not new, the detailed analysis conducted by Gladwell provided a thought-provoking insight.  I highly recommend this book!
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This film was an act of love by Harris.  A man who obviously grew up steeped in westerns, as many of us his age were.  The story has all of the elements of a classic western, but for me the moment that lifted it from vintage to art was the scene of the train being watched from afar by a cougar atop a desert bluff.  Transcendent.

B0014DC0AK|5.0|Don't think I write this just to gush over Amazon's products.  Symbolic really is a great album, and if you don't buy it here I would suggest getting it by any means necessary.    Death isn't one of those bands that I \\"got\\" right away.  The first time I heard them was way back in the days of MTV's Headbanger's Ball, and I remember being characteristically unimpressed by \\"The Philosopher.\\"    Nevertheless, recently hearing the song again on YouTube encouraged me to rediscover this band.  \\"Human\\" led me to \\"Thought Patterns,\\" which then led me to \\"Symbolic\\".  The fact that this band improved by leaps and bounds with each album is an often overstated fact, but it is a fact regardless of the overstatement.  I bought Symbolic a week ago, and I literally cannot stop listening to it.    Anyone into metal needs to check this out.  If I were to compile a \\"primer\\" to the world of metal, it would undoubtedly contain the first Sabbath album, Number of the Beast, Master of Puppets, and Symbolic.  After these four albums, what else has anyone really done?
B001GQACGO|2.0|When I hear the word fierce, I expect it to be fierce. I really don't understand why this album needed to be two discs. The I AM portion bored me to death, severely. I honestly didn't listen to each song to the last second because I'd die of boredom before reaching it.  As far as Sasha \\"Fierce\\", I liked Radio fairly well. Diva, I think the only reason I really liked it is the beat, sounds so close to A Milli by Lil Wayne. And it should, it was the same producer (Bangladesh).      I wouldn't buy this album. I'd get it from someone who was dumb enough to buy it. I don't know what she was trying to prove on this album. Perhaps she was trying to prove something to critics, because I think she completely missed her fans with this one. And if THIS is the album that she had the most creative control over.......

B000NVIXFK|4.0|You can't go home again?  Don't tell that to these geeky geezers.  \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is a keeper -- an 11th hour near-masterpiece that puts awkward, self-conscious recent efforts such as \\"Test for Echo\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\" to shame. Tracks like \\"Good News First\\" and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" are both tuneful and touching, while \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" sound like, well, Rush.  Awesome stuff!

0307455874|5.0|I finally purchased this book after the election, just to read Barack Obama in his own words.  This is a well-thought out and fair representation of how a lot of people who are more moderate in their thinking see the current state of government.  Lefties will wish he was more revolutionary, and righties will have to call their presumptions into question.  All I know is the way Barack Obama has handled all the current crises bodes well for the future of the country's next four years, and the way he acts is in sync with the way he writes about his beliefs.  The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I highly recommend the seller.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|It was great to watch Halloween on Blu-ray because of it's clarity.  Turning a 1978 movie to something that looked like it was shot a couple days ago was very cool to see.  All the pops and crackles and dots and stuff throughout the audio and video tracks were virtually gone.  The special features were fun to watch too.  Overall, a good investment!
0312370849|4.0|This book definitely grabs the reader from page 1 as it tells the tale of a little known episode in French WWII history.  The alternating points-of-view are fascinating.  The modern day prospective lessens the suspense and for me, importance of the story.  After about midway through the book the present time comes off as downright silly and goes downhill from there.  I had trouble buying the present day narrator's seemingly sudden obsession with Sarah and she became more implausible as the story progressed.  All in all, an engaging story and one that is historically significant and needed to be told.

B001FB55LM|4.0|I had a chance to see an advance screening of Yes Man last night and I have to say it's one of his best comedies since Me, Myself & Irene. I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners.  It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likeable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future. All in all this is a fine film and if you're looking for a break from the profanity filed gross out comedies of recent memory, then say yes to Yes Man.
1934648035|4.0|What can you say about Hesse that hasnt already been said. The book's exploration of one mans search for meaning and enlightenment during the period of the first buddha is truly timeless.  I wish the tranlation was as strong.  Misprints are frequent,sentences are missing modifiers while other sentences seem to dangle in the air.  Of course this becomes a very minor distraction to the piece as a whole which is why I gave the book 4 stars.  If your looking to read Siddhartha do so but beware of the translation.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|If you like Jane Austen you will like this movie!  It is different from the other version of Persuasion but yet it still moves you as Persuasion does.

B000ETQR3Q|2.0|The box and a commercial for this gun described two features inaccurately. They stated the gun could shoot 35 feet, and that the gun's scope gave it pinpoint accuracy. However, it can shoot no more than 25 feet, and the scope didn't improve the accuracy at all. Furthermore, the dart clips keep getting stuck in the gun. I do not suggest this product.

B001FQB2MI|5.0|This enhanced version of the exemplary \\"Spirit\\" CD is vintage. Leona Lewis' vocals soar on all four of the bonus tracks. The tender and emotive \\"Run\\" is dramatic and dynamic. \\" A Moment Like This\\" is triumphant and cathartic. \\"Forgive Me\\" is a great single that will resonate with the masses. \\"Misses Glass\\" is a unique gem. The Leona Lewis rise to stardom is a great story. In addition to being a supreme vocalist, Ms. Lewis is a humane animal lover who reveres God, her family and her middle class British culture. She's unaffected and down to earth. It's amazing that so much musical talent continues to emanate from England. In a few years Leona may arguably be the biggest star on the planet. There's nothing vain or conceited about her. \\"Footprints In The Sand\\" says it all.
B001JNNE64|2.0|the thing i always loved about this movie was how tragic salieri was as a character. he spends time in prayer thanking god for the passion he's given him, only to be crushed by a moron who's seemingly effortless ability  eclipses his own. he can't understand why god would give him the desire, then 'make him mute'... this passion and drive are what made him so appealing! the added scenes make him a villain, and thus, for me at least ruin his character. i really wish i had not seen this version, because it impaired my opinion of the film. the scene where costanza came to find salieri working with her sick husband only to throw salieri out seemed like she was just 'looking out for her husband and wanted him to get his rest' and by kicking out salieri he loses his one chance in life to learn from this guy. it's tragedy. it makes him a sympathetic character... the director's cut makes it clear that she throws him out because she hates him, and rightly so, but as the viewer salieri DESERVES this treatment... it ruins the moment...    salieri was so much 'deeper' in the theatrical version. i ached for him because it was so frustrating to watch someone fail against such a moronic force of nature as tom hulce's brilliant mozart... by making him an unforgivable character the movie was ruined for me. such a shame...

B0017V7GTY|3.0|Let's forget the Springsteen, Westerberg, etc... references for a minute and take the band for what they are at the moment, not what they may become. What I hear is a solid rock (not punk) band with a better than average songwriter who happens to write very catchy,(Anthemic) and ultimately enjoyable tunes. Not a bad combination, but let's not annoint them quite yet. I'll keep spinning (and digging) this one and hope the next one ups the ante a bit. The potential is there, let's see if they can deliver.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|When Enya releases an album, it's not just a 'release'. It's an event. That is what a music entertainment expert said a few years ago. She was right. The very magnitude of Enya's work and daring to differ on a musical landscape that is otherwise run over by commercialism and mediocrity, is proof. And WInter Came, in essence, is no different than any other Enya's albums. And why should it be? This is Enya. Almost all  the songs on this CD have the signature Enya vocals, extensive, carefully defined layering, ethereal tunes and meaningful content. The Christmas or Holiday season numbers have not just been re-rendered, but redone. They are solid and promising. One Toy SOldier is probably one that everyone will like. Similarly the main (promoted) single Trains and Winter Rains is a usual Enya work, and contains the same methodical and carefully strung beat of an ENya song. The different number is My My Time Flies, and my, does it suprise. Encompassing guitar of all things, it is a revisitation to music of the seventies or sixties if you will. It talks about the concept of how far we have come in history. In my opinion, another jewel to add to their collection for Enya fans. Like a critic or reviewer said. It is relief to the ears to listen to. Cheers and well wishes for a happy season, Enya style.
B000063JZQ|1.0|After reading William Shakespeare's play in class, I was looking forward to watching the movie hoping for a different rendition or some sort of creative spin on the play. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. The movie turned out to be just as lackluster as the play itself. I am pretty sure that every single line of the original play is said in the movie, with no substitutions or additions. This lack of originality very nearly put me to sleep. The only spin the film had on the play was during the last 20 seconds when Donalbain is seen searching for the witches. The movie also pulled away much of the symbolism that the original play contained. The acting was terrible as well. On a more positive note however, the acting was so bad that at one point, during Macbeth and Macduff's battle I was very amused. I feel sorry that Shakespeare's work has been turned into a less than half decent film. He is said to be one of the greatest writers of all time, yet filmmakers destroy his play.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Classic - action story - can very much be related to current issues in the Middle East today - tribes fighting tribes and their inability to get along at many times except to come together to fight a common enemy.<br />Great spectacular larger than life scenes.<br />The original Lawrence was an odd, short and not very handsome man, Peter O'Toole is so beautiful, it is hard to take your eyes off him. He is a big breathtaking in his white robes.<br />I've heart the book that he wrote \\"The Seven Pillars\\" is better than the movie, and I've gotten that and plan to read as well. This is a movie that everyone should have in their permanent movie collection, it can be watched over and over. I believe it is one of the all time best movies. I even heard that before Stephen Speelberg makes a movie, he always watches this first - to remind himself just how \\"the perfect movie\\" looks.....
B00005OM4K|5.0|This box set is a truly must have for anyone who appreicates music. It has it all from the studio to Live sets, from the beging to the end just everyting and then some. The box set itself is a very sturdy well built and pleasing to the eye with a printed faux wood veneer finish. The individual CD books are very solid and well put together. The included lititature is well detailed and very organized. The remastered recordings themselves sound really good not as good as the CCR SACD's but hey this whole collection cost just a little more one of the SACD's and you get so much more. For
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Alright, so I've heard so many people complain about this movie that I've decided to write my own opinion on the matter. First of all, people felt the CGI was used way too much for this movie. Granted, the monkeys swinging from the vines scene was a bit too cartoonish, and could have been left on the cutting room floor. Regardless, I thought it was used appropriately, compared to many other movies today which rely so heavily on it. Watch the special features and you'll see Harrison Ford doing a majority of the foot work in this film. Even Spielberg noted that if Ford had an odometer, the mileage for this film would be greater then all the other ones.     The one complaint that I absolutely cannot and will not hear or accept is that this Indy flick is \\"way too unrealistic\\", saying that the aliens have no place in an Indiana Jones film. WHAT!?! Are you joking? Listen, what's more plausible: Me ripping your heart out while it simultaneously combusts or opening a box that releases ghosts that melt your face off?  Oh, you say neither one is plausible? Wow, that's funny.....cause I swear that's what was in the previous Indy films. The fact that it's unbelievable and ridiculous makes this a fitting addition to the Indy franchise. I love the fridge scene just as much as I like the face melting scene from Raiders. Don't look at the ghost and you'll be okay. Stay in the fridge and you won't be nuked. I see no difference.    Entertaining film and would love to see another. There I said it.

B0000TG9E2|4.0|One day while Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) is trying to pay attention to her lessons, she sees a White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) go by.  This is no ordinary White Rabbit, however.  He's looking at his pocket watch and worrying about being late.  Curious, Alice follows him only to fall down a hole and land in Wonderland.<br /><br />And what sort of place is Wonderland?  It's a place where anything and everything can talk.  Besides the animals, we've got a talking doorknob.  Eating and drinking can make Alice grow and shrink.  As she tries to follow the White Rabbit and find out where he is going, she meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee (J. Pat O'Malley), joins an Unbirthday Party with the Mad Hatter (Ed Wynn) and the March Hare (Jerry Colonna), has a couple run ins with the Cheshire Cat (Sterling Holloway), gets lost in a strange wood, and has plays crochet with the Queen of Hearts (Verna Felton).  Will she ever get home?<br /><br />It had been years since I'd seen this, so I had forgotten just how many songs there are in the movie.  Just about every character sings one at some point.  But there is a reason you don't remember most of them.  They're just okay.<br /><br />Really, this movie is just a series of adventures loosely held together by the White Rabbit.  While that works for the books this movie is based on, it doesn't work quite as well here.  I tend to get bored before we meet up with the Queen.  Still, there are several funny scenes and several enjoyable songs.<br /><br />Honestly, I enjoyed it more then I remember enjoying it.  The kids will particularly love this wacky tale.

045122499X|4.0|A very interesting story, with well developed characters, but falls short as historical fiction.  World Without End was difficult to put down even at 1,000+ pages. Follett is superb at capturing the reader's attention and keeping it.    From an historical point it was quite informative on the daily life and struggles of the 14th century. However, Follett fails to maintain his objectivity and applies modern morals to the middle ages. He comes across as a femnist. Most of the male characters, with a few notable exceptions, are either oafish, evil, lustful, coldy calculating, fiendish, stupid, or some combination of these characteristics.  Most of the primary female characters are admirable and are intelligent, hard working, kind, passionate, and struggling to thrive in a male dominated society. Follett's judgmental framework does not detract from the story, but does make the novel less useful as historical fiction.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|The Day That Never Comes and Unforgiven III are awesome, but the rest of the cd didn't really do it for me. My cousins are all older than me and they swear that Metallica is the best band ever. I've started listening to Metallica's older stuff and I'm starting to agree. Some of these songs like Nothing Else Matters, One, and Unforgiven are incredibly good.
B000000OMP|5.0|What is not to like about this classic rock albumn?  I bought this CD to replace the cassette that has seen better days.
B001EB5CDO|4.0|I remember when I first heard this album I was simply blown away all those years ago.  I didn't know until then just how intelligent and musically complex the Metal genre could be until I had heard this album and later the works of Metallica and Iron Maiden.  I had heard of course the brilliant \\"Enter Sandman\\" by then but I never got the complete Metallica album until much later.  In hindsight I'd say that it's a dead heat with regards which is the better album as they are both great in their own ways.  Although a couple of tracks for me are forgettable on Metallica's Black album I just find every track on Countdown to be simply brilliant and certainly not a single filler track to be seen.  Mustaine and Friedman are both brilliant kicking each other up the butt trying to upstage each other in solos (e.g. \\"High Speed Dirt\\") and pleasantly reminded me of how Duane and Dickey used to do the same way back when in the Allman Brothers Band to the delight of guitarists and fans alike.<br /><br />This mlps (mini-lp replica sleeve) version though is a mixed bag.  First the great news: this album has been very well remastered for an excellent sound and this is not surprising given Mustaine's personal involvement in the project.  We get a very nice write-up my Mustaine himself in an insert which in addition to having all the lyrics in both English and Japanese has the essay by Dave called \\"Love And Bruises\\" where he talks about the remastered recording and his memories of the making of the album which he says: \\"Yeah, I knew that this was going to be the biggest record that I had ever made.  And it has been a matter of trying to beat COUNTDOWN ever since.  This remix may be the only way that I can beat this masterpiece; that is, by going in and making it sound a little bit better and including some of the history and outtakes from that period.\\"<br /><br />Dave needn't worry because this album sounds a whole lot better than the first cd I got all those years ago and it was like listening to a new modern day recording, what sound!  The inner sleeve design is also nice faithfully replicating the original lp.  The only beef I have with this and is why I only gave it 4 stars is the actual assembly of the mlps itself which is so disappointingly poor given the brilliance of the rest of the package.  The cardboard is of thin poor quality and looks as if it will fall apart once the glue gets old and in fact mine's already starting to come apart.  For examples of very well assembled mlps designs go see the ones done for the entire Hall & Oates reissue as well as those done for Queen and The Band which are simply works of art which showed those concerned had great pride in their work.  Of course Mustaine cannot be blamed for this as he did his part in selecting great bonus tracks and remastering the content so well but whoever did the mlps design and assembly should be kicked in the nuts.  The bonus tracks by the way are: \\"Crown of Worms\\" (an excellent track that should have been included in the original album to begin with), \\"Countdown To Extinction (Demo)\\", \\"Symphony of Destruction (Demo)\\" and \\"Psychotron (Demo)\\"  all excellent tracks by the way.<br /><br />I know many \\"fans\\" will hate any Metal that even remotely sounds melodious or commercial but if you are able to judge good music for what it is irrespective of the genre, you'll agree that this is excellent music and for me among the top 5 ever Metal albums ever made and is certainly overall given great songwriting, musicianship etc is Megadeth's best album.  Listening to it again while writing this I still can't get over the excellent sound quality and remastering they did on this baby.  Coldplay and today's \\"Metal\\" bands aren't worthy to tie Mustaine's shoes when you hear just how much better this album alone is to what's currently out there.  Has anyone even come close to anything Megadeth, Metallica and Iron Maiden have ever done?  I mean seriously!<br /><br />In conclusion, this mlps version of an excellent album is a mixed bag because it costs a great deal and yet the cardboard sleeve is poorly designed and assembled but the great liner notes by Dave and the excellent sound quality somewhat makes up for this.  You decide if this is still a value proposition enough for you to part with the serious mullah this retails at.<br /><br />Peace!mixed bag because it costs a great deal and yet the cardboard sleeve is poorly designed and assembled but the great liner notes by Dave and the excellent sound quality somewhat makes up for this.

B001FSDOZO|4.0|Ok, let me make this quick and simple.  Do you like Nickelback's ballads, or their raunchier harder side (or if you don't know Nickelback very well do you like ballads or harder more explicit rock)?    If you are all about the melodies and love songs...save your money.    If you like your music with a bit more edge, this is a great album.      No it doesn't break any new ground...and it isn't for headbangers or the hardcore.  However if you aren't totally jaded and want something fun to get you a little amped up then this is a good fun album.      THIS IS NOT AN ALBUM THAT YOU SHOULD PLAY WITH KIDS AROUND.  Yeah, I know somewhere there is a 14 year old who is convinced I am full of it and he/she os plenty mature to listen to this.  They aren't and some of the materail here could give a young person a pretty jaded view of relationships and sensuality.

But when I started to play it, I saw that the music on it was from \\"Studio Sessions\\".  No Search and Destroy or Gimme Danger. Not at all the playlist for Raw Power. Despite even the labelling on the CD itself, it is not Raw Power. I cannot explain it.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I know there is a lot of controversy out there about this movie.  A lot of people do not like the way that they portrayed humans in the movie. I think the realization that our country could turn into something like that is entirely possible, and way too scary for some people to handle.  My kids liked it, but at 2 and 5 did not get the complexity or the moral of the story.      My son especially liked the movie since there wasnt a lot of talking in it.  It was almost like watching those old Tom & Jerry cartoons, where there isnt a lot of talking, just sounds.      My husband liked it a lot too.  So its one of those movies that really does appeal to all ages.  I give it a thumbs up.
0307269752|5.0|Never heard of Stieg Larson, but the title intrigued me?! The story began slowly for me...details about business that dragged on...but I kept reading, waiting for the girl with the dragon tattoo! She showed up...but was really on the fringe of the plot (although a very interesting character). The best part of the story for me was the search for Harriet, which includes inspection of her rich, eccentric family. The main character (who is hired to find Harriet) is sympathetic and I rooted for him to succeed. If you like books about business, there is a part of the plot that revolves around that, but it didn't hinder me that much because the entire story weaved in and out and around several little plots in an interesting manner. The book was translated into English, so some of the proper names were almost unpronouncable for me...I just made up my own way to pronouce them in my head. I finished reading this book in two days (between working and sleeping) because I wanted to know what happened...and I wasn't diappointed!!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I think my husband loved the movie more than my kids did.  Good movie, better for 6-9 year olds rather than 2-5 (which my children are).  They didnt get the complexity of it, but they still liked it.  It was nice to see a movie dipict another culture.  My kids wanted to know more about the Asain culture after watching this movie.
B000063JZQ|3.0|I was excited to watch this interpretation of Macbeth, but was greatly disappointed. The acting was awful. The actors were either too dramatic or weren't into the action enough. It seemed to me that they didn't care at all about what they were doing. If you want a version of Macbeth that goes basically hand in hand with the play than this is it. I enjoy movies better when directors put twists and change up how things happen instead of leaving them exactly how they are in the play. Another thing, they stuck exactly to the text in the play. They didn't adapt it into any sort of modern English or put a twist on it or anything. All in all, this movie was a disgrace to Shakespeare's play and to directors everywhere.
0553382179|5.0|Wow, this book rocks!

I love this book! It has changed my life.

0156034026|5.0|I like many people thought religious fundamentalism when I picked up this book, but it was never once mentioned in the book. Not once was religion mentioned. The fundamentalism is based on the bottom line mentioned when Changez finally had enough. He was being instructed to overlook the people who he originally respected for their hard work and expertise and base his evaluations on the \\"bottom line\\". Money mattered, not people. He was attaracted to a woman he could and should not have, lived in a culture that could accept him -- only with limits. This book is a fast read because it is written conversationally written.

Now I'm a die hard fan and was going to wait for the \\"Whole Bloody Affair\\" edition, but honestly, Im in the movie biz, and I can tell you that the distribution rights are held by the Weinstiens, and it will probably be on this side of \\"who the hell knows when\\", and if they ever decide to release it. so go ahead and pick these up, because well probably never get that WBA edition.

0739321005|5.0|I listened to this audio book on a five hour driving trip, when I was rolling along or in standing traffic. (Don't worry, the book is not five hours long.) It was a wonderful introduction to his early years, his family, his fledgling start in community organizing, and his decision to get an advanced degree.  You'll learn what his parents and extended family  poured into his character and where he gets some of his ferver and inspiration to change how we approach political and social issues in our country. At the end of the recording, you'll hear his 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic Convention, where most of us first met Sen. Obama; then everything you heard in this memoir will fall into place. President Obama received a Grammy Award for this recording and when you hear it, you'll know why!

B00004T0US|4.0|It often pains a lot of his fans to know that whenever people think of Elvis Presley these days, the image isn't that of the hip-swiveling cat who changed the face of American music in the staid 1950s, nor the B-movie matinee idol of the 1960s, nor even the resurrected pop icon of that famous '68 NBC Comeback Special, but that of a bloated train wreck done in by his own extreme abuse of prescription pills, bad diets, too much Vegas, and too cold-blooded a manager.  But right up until the end, Elvis kept on trying to do his best.  He may not have always succeeded, but at least he tried.  The proof of that was on what sadly turned out to be his very last album, MOODY BLUE, released mere weeks before that terrible August day in 1977.    This CD release actually combines that album with his 1976 album FROM ELVIS PRESLEY BOULEVARD; and though one can tell at times that Elvis was clearly no longer the man that generations had grown up with (by the 70s, the ballads outnumbered the rockers, due in no small measure to the cataclysmic collapse of his marriage to Priscilla), he still somehow managed to come up with some true gems.  The tracks from FROM ELVIS PRESLEY BOULEVARD include an incredibly powerful version of Timi Yuro's 1961 classic \\"Hurt\\", which, despite sounding wildly out of place during the disco era, managed to get to #28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1976; its flip side, \\"For The Heart\\", was wrriten by Dennis Linde, whose \\"Burning Love\\" was Elvis' last Top Ten hit, in 1972.  MOODY BLUE, meanwhile, featured, among other gems, the title track written by the same writer (Mark James) whose \\"Suspicious Minds\\" was arguably Elvis' finest hour as a vocalist (it hit #31 in March 1977), an R&B-style version of George Jones' 1962 country smash hit \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\"; and a fine version of Johnny Ace's 1954 classic \\"Pledging My Love.\\"  The big hit on the album, of course, was \\"Way Down\\", which showed that Elvis could still have the same impact on people as he always did.  Sadly, by the time \\"Way Down\\" reached #18 on the Billboard Hot 100, the King was no longer alive.    If MOODY BLUE is an imperfect album in the eyes of many, it is only because its maker was imperfect.  Elvis often battled so many demons, both from within and without, in his later years that he was frequently unable to succeed either onstage or in the studio.  It was a struggle that he sadly lost, and the pop music world, whether it acknowledged it or not, was poorer for that loss.  But however imperfect MOODY BLUE may be, it still showed that Elvis would always be a Gold standard by which any self-respecting male pop and rock and roll star would be measured.  Elvis may have left the building on August 16, 1977, but his presence will remain with us forever.
B00003CY6M|3.0|This is a backdoor Christmas movie where everyone lives happily ever after, I guess. My wife saw this on TV and wanted it. I watched it with her. John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale are both attractive and develop good chemistry with their sidekicks but there are too few scenes of their one night romance to validate the premise of the movie, a compulsive belief that they had met THE PERSON but let them slip away.    Hey, my wife liked it - I am her hero for buying it; I hope! She held my hand. I felt pretty good about that! GUYS!!! Do yourself a favor if your need a chick flick for your library of movies, this ain't bad.

David Cook can rock your socks or break your heart with that gorgeous voice.  And with his complementary looks, brains and personality, I think he is looking at a stellar career.  I'll be looking at him!

0394804406|5.0|This is my all time favorite children's book. I am an early childhood educator, and I read tons of books, but this one stands out.  The illustrations are brilliant, the concept is moving and beautiful, and it opens the door for talking about fish, frogs, metamorphosis, or even learning not to take things for granted. I love Leo Lionni. The messages in his books can reach into the hearts of people of all ages.    Good for Children ages 3-10.

0956010903|5.0|After months of anticipation, I was so excited to find Beedle the Bard on my doorstep.  It was well packaged, and came in great shape.  I'm a book binder, and I think this one is very well done, and of good quality for a commercial volume.  You don't see well designed, well made bindings like this much in modern times.  The outer book is a cool detail for fans, although if I remember correctly, it's supposed to be \\"Hogwart's: A History\\", or something other than the main title.  No matter, it's fun.  The inner book has heavy metal findings, and the typeset and illustrations are in an old style that is very convincing.  The velvet pouch is a nice touch.  I could imagine this being in Albus' collection.  A great addition to any Harry Potter fan's bookshelf, and for a good cause, it's well worth it.  Very pleased!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Who would have thought that this late in his career that Paul could have three of the greatest post-Beatle albums!  Chaos and Creation, Memory Almost Full, and now Electric Arguments are all three amazing works, and they are all completely different from each other.  In my opinion, this is the greatest three album run in Paul's career.  This is Paul's grand experimental album that works on all levels.  I wish the sequencing was a little different, but that is easy to fix.  Track after track are diverse wonders of sound, and I've never heard Paul play so much wonderful harmonica! You can't miss with this album.  Keep 'em comin', Paul!

B0002S947K|4.0|This albumn has a very cool sound -- Ray Lamontagne brings a bit of Otis Redding to the kind of Marin County folk tunes Van Morrison produced during his best years. The Otis comparison is not to say that Ray has the same power in his vocals -- he's much more restrained as fits the genre -- more that he has the same feeling of emotion that's almost struggling to get out that Redding brought to many of his songs. While most of this album is comprised of mellow acoustic guitar, mournful harmonica and quieted down drums, its does have a couple of deviations from format in songs like \\"Forever My Friend\\" and \\"How Come\\" which strongly resemble Dave Mason songs (the later bearing a strong resemblance to \\"Feelin' Alright\\" in both its sound and its merging of downer lyrics with upbeat tempos). Definitely not an albumn of party tunes, but good chill out music if you want something with a little more depth than Jack Johnson.
0385338600|5.0|It's a little different than his other legal thrillers, and while it was his first book it either wasn't published or was re-released after The Firm. It is a little less slick, but has a lot more character development than his later books, as well as a lot more detail. More of a labor of love than just a successful formula, if you get my drift.<br /><br />The story centers around the seemingly justifiable homicide in a small southern (Mississippi) town by a black father of the rapists of his daughter. This all unfolds in about two pages, and the book never lets up much from there. When done as a film the story becomes kind of an unbelievable Hollywood circus, but in the book the process is developed in a deliberative process, and the Rube Goldberg quality of the plot maintains plausability and excitement.<br /><br />Again, it is a little longer than most of his other books, and not so polished, but if you like strong and well-developed characters and especially if you already like JG, then it's hard to see how you would not love this book. Even if you are not a JG fan, give this one a try- it is really good, original southern writing.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Well, I had never listened to Nightwish before ordering Dark Passion Play, and boy was I hooked!!! The music is varied, with great heavy, guitar-laden songs, like Master Passion Greed-- as well as folk-sounding music, The Islander--and darned catchy songs, like Amaranth, that you just have to sing along with. I love it. I had no preconceived expectations, having never heard them before, and I've since ordered their other albums and enjoy them as well. I love both Anette's vocals and Tarja's. Nightwish is definitely my new favorite band!
0440234743|3.0|There aren't that many fiction books that I read where at some level I don't feel a little guilty about the wasted time. Thus when I got into this JG book and realized it had a lot of substance and a lot of eternal truths I was willing to overlook some of the choppiness and other weaknesses. I'm always a bit on the lookout for the next C.S. Lewis, and always let down, usually from the literary perspective more than the theological perspective. This book was a bit of a let down in both, although it still succeeded on some levels and definitely JG gets an A for trying.<br /><br />The vehicle for a subtle look at salvation is the struggle of a missionary to South Central America and the backdrop of jungle and exotic peoples makes for a nice change from the boardroom, although the boardroom is not completely left behind. A solid story, and a nice bit of metaphor, reminiscent to me of a George McDonald story, only less charming. It's worth the read, but go easy on your expectations.

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Outlier\\" is a thought-provoking and entertaining analysis in which the author explores why certain people fall outside the norms of human behavior and achievement.  For example, how did Bill Gates became a superstar in his field while other equally talented and intelligent men and women failed to reach their potential?<br /><br />Gladwell is a marvelous storyteller who opens with an intriguing description of the Italian village of Roseto, where \\"virtually no one under fifty-five had died of a heart attack,\\" and where the death rate was remarkably lower than expected.  Fifty years ago, a physician conducted a study to determine whether Rosetans followed a strict diet or exercised vigorously.  There had to be some explanation for their unusual good health.  Why was this town an \\"outlier,\\" \\"a place that lay outside everyday experience, where the normal rules did not apply?\\"  The study's findings demonstrate that in order to understand outliers, we have to look at a number of diverse factors.<br /><br />The author contends that a whole host of elements may come into play, such as one's date of birth, cultural milieu, religious background, and economic advantages.  To some extent, everyone, no matter how gifted, is a product of his or her environment, upbringing, and opportunities. Those who achieve success often profit from a special combination of ability, determination, hard work, and luck.  Otherwise, they might be destined to muddle along like the rest of us average folk.<br /><br />\\"Outlier\\" is not just about success.  It is also about spectacular failure, such as the horrendous crashes that for a time made Korean Air a pariah in aviation circles.  Why, between 1988 and 1998, did this airline have a \\"loss rate\\" seventeen times higher than United Airlines?  To understand this, we have to analyze how \\"cultural legacies\\" exert their own power throughout the generations.<br /><br />\\"Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.\\"  Gladwell shares his personal history that, he believes, partly explains his own attainments.  He discusses how having the right forbears plus a bit of serendipity has made all the difference in the trajectory of his life.  It is easy to dismiss \\"Outliers\\" as another glib take on matters that anyone with common sense could figure out for himself, such as:  It helps to be in the right place at the right time; hard work pays off; without a big break, most men and women are destined to toil in obscurity.  However, Gladwell is far from simplistic.  In detailed and reflective chapters filled with insightful observations, he encourages us to see the big picture that all too often is missed when we cling to our preconceived notions.istory that, he believes, partly explains his own attainments.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is the best Christmas film I have seen in a long, long time. It certainly has all of the elements that should appeal to kids -- fabulous wintery landscapes, a magical locomotive, roller coaster-esque scenes, elves, leaping reindeer, Santa himself. By the same token, it is clever enough for adults, with a delightful double layer to it revolving around faith -- more specifically, believing in the true, giving spirit of Christmas and taking an optimistic view even when facing bleak circumstances.    The animation is excellent, although sometimes movements seem awkward, jerky, and sharp rather than fluid and natural (something that especially stands out in the Hot Chocolate scene). In some ways, I wonder why they animated this instead of making it a live-action film. That said, the animation is downright amazing at its best. Environments and props look convincingly real, and sometimes it's uncanny how closely the people look like, well, people.    The characters themselves are so-so. The little girl was almost too good (I stress \\"almost\\"). Billy -- the poor kid -- was all right, but seemed more like a stock character than a fully fledged individual. I most enjoyed the protagonist, the tramp, and the conductor -- especially the conductor, who showed that sometimes firmness and sternness can live in close quarters with kindness.    One downside to this movie is that it's very long for a kid's movie -- smaller kids might find this a bit daunting. Another thing that will probably appeal to adults alone is the tramp; little ones might be frightened by his shenanigans.    I don't think you can go wrong with this film, however. The narrative is strong, the protagonist's personal development is very moving, and the story ends with a very moving tear-jerker sure to fill you with optimism for days. Personally, I love all the little touches -- the unsaid messages are all too fun to catch, and Tom Hanks voicing the narrator, the tramp, the conductor, and the father has some delightful connotations.    I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

0767840135|3.0|This Cirque de Soleil is very different from any other I've seen.  It is very dark.  The costumes are gothic, the music is beautiful, but sad, and the acts, while fantastic, are done with no smiles or enthusiasm.  The theme is to explore our society's isolationalism, and while that is an interesting theme, it makes for a depressing circus show.  There are, as always, some amazing acts, but they are done in this dark, depressing way.  My son liked it, but I liked the other shows much better.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|GREAT movie! A perfect buy for anyone...NOT just Batman lovers or super hero addicts! Any person who appreciates a good movie will like this film. The only downside is that it is a little lengthy...but mind you, it is WELL worth it!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook is awesome!  All the songs on this album are great to listen to.  Usually when you buy an album there is only one or two songs you can relate to but not in this case.

B001BODXW6|5.0|this album is just great, Daron Malakian alone. Although he needs Serj, Daron does his best in the vocals and reminds us of some great elements System of a Down used in their songs. Scars is a different take on rock music, and I think its a good step for Daron and John.

Beyonce does this and so much more and she does it well!!!  If you don't have it-- go get it - this CD truly shows that Mrs. Carter has changed into a woman - complex, unsure at times, afraid of being lonley but knowing her worth as a DIVA !!

B00005ATZT|5.0|- The Fugitive -    Once in a lifetime, when I was a kid of 10 years, I would find a program on TV that the whole family - 3 generations - could enjoy.  Well, Amazon has brought back the joy of reliving the past with The Fugitive (the original with David Janssen).  I invited my 90-year-old mom to my room to view it with me.  There was Richard Kimball in all his hyper-vigilant glory, ducking into alleys and hiding out in bus terminals, constantly running from \\"the law,\\" police detective Gerard.  I'm told the series is based on the great French nover, Le Miserables, by Victor Hugo. I read it and sure enough, The Fugitive brings out the essence of predator vs prey.  A real return-to-the-past - the good old days!  I recommend it for all fans and invite good thriller audiences to take the adventure.  It's well worth it!

B0015519VS|5.0|When Usher first released this album back in the summer, I had my money ready to purchase. However, so many people started \\"doggin\\" the album out. I was at Walmart in the cd section and overheard two women speaking about the album saying things like \\"he could of done better,\\" \\"I don't really like it,\\" and other stuff. Not mention, when I asked a few friends and coworkers what they thought, I got similar replies. Plus, his first few singles were lackluster at best. So I put off getting the album, but then \\"Trading Places\\" became a single and it sounded like something from Confessions. So I finally gave the cd a try and WOW!!! I wish I would have bought it sooner.<br /><br />It is a great album. I do not know why everybody thinks the album is bad or ok. Usher will not be \\"Forever 21\\" so fans must expect his music to change as he gets older as with any music artist (think of Souja Boy in 30 years).<br /><br />My Favs are:<br /><br />Trading Places<br />Moving Mountains<br />What's Your Name<br />Love You Gently<br />Before I Met You<br />Lifetime<br />Here I Stand<br /><br />The other tracks are decent, but I have found that I repeat the tracks above the most when listening in the car.<br /><br />VERDICT: Buy the album, while this is not Confessions, you should not be expecting it to be.
0307455874|5.0|It is a phenomenal book - it gives such clear insight into his thought process, why he will do a phenomenal job with the country; his inclusiveness and where that comes from.  And the literary style is so well done - I read his first book, fell in love with him then; in reading this, falling further - he's an incredible human being, and so right for this country at this time.  The book shows you how he is and how he will be - so far he's true to his image, his promises, and his hope for this country.

B000RJO578|4.0|Hot Fuzz  After Shaun of the Dead, the writer/director/actor trio of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost came up with this new comedy that does for cop movies what Shaun did for zombie flicks. As before Wright directs a script written by himself and Pegg, and Pegg and Frost star. Pegg plays Nick Angel, a London cop so dedicated and efficient he starts to skew the statistics away from his less motivated colleagues. He soon finds himself transferred to Sandford, a tiny little rural village on the books with the lowest crime rate in England. Angel is understandably miffed by this, especially when partnered with the local police chief's son (Frost), who's a likable lunkhead. Shortly after his arrival, though, gruesome deaths start occurring. Angel is sure it's murder, but everyone else in town thinks the deaths are accidental. Angel becomes determined to solve the crimes no matter how many toes he must step on. This very funny movie manages to walk a very fine line: it spoofs American action movies hilariously but never stops being British. It does, however, come by its R rating very honestly, with rampant profanity and some very gory murders. The violence is as over the top as it was in Shaun of the Dead, but with that same matter of fact/deadpan tone that pushes it past icky into icky-but-funny. (kind of like the gore in a Monty Python movie) And what a cast the boys have in support this time: Timothy Dalton (2 time 007), Edward Woodward (The Wicker Man-1973), a couple of unidentifiable but hilarious celebrity cameos, and briefly, Martin Freeman (The Office-British version). If you enjoy English humor or thought Shaun of the Dead was fun, definitely check this one out.
031606792X|5.0|I am only reviewing this last book, but all the books are well deserved 5 stars. Especially this last book, that is just jaw dropping, nail biting, cant put down amazing.<br />Stephanie Meyers dream, started and ended with a spellbinding, ultimate mind blowing world, and heart stopping romance. I tip my hat to you Ms Stephanie Meyer, for these blissfully wonderful books you dreamed up. I loved the way you ended the saga. All the books were your dream of what vampires were, and only your dream. So the way you ended it, shouldn't be up to the fan's idea of what is a Twilight world, but to your own world, a world I am proud to be a part of.<br /> I see a whole new series... in this last book, hopefully you go there, and it will be to my delight.<br /><br />Side note: Thanks for letting your books be in Kindle. I have arthritis, and its hard holding books, this new way of reading is a blessing to my hurting wrists, and I only wish more authors would put their books in the amazon Kindle.
B00180R06I|2.0|Vampyr (1932) While I enjoy a lot of movies both new and old, sometimes there are films that I watch and end up appreciating more than enjoying. This is one of those films. Director Carl Theodore Dreyer wanted to experiment with light and shadow effects in a film to create an atmosphere of dread. The movie that resulted is more visual than aural; a nearly silent affair with only some synchronized sound. For his story Dreyer credits the vampire tale Carmilla, but what's onscreen bears little resemblance to that novella. Instead we get young Allan Gray (Julian West), a kind of a supernatural investigator whose delving into the netherworld has left him in a tenuous state between the real world and the world of dreams and nightmares. He comes to the small town of Courtempierre at the request of the village's lord of the manor to see what has befallen the lord's daughter. Her health is draining away, and our hero discovers the entire village is awash in evil all tied to an ancient vampire lurking there. However, I've actually lent this plot more coherence and credence than even the film does as the viewer is quickly swept up in a series of nightmare images and effects that were obviously far more important to the director than story or character. And there are some truly striking visuals, with a constantly moving camera and wild ideas like shadows that move independent from their casters. These are all the more impressive when you consider how big movie cameras were at the time and how much light was needed for even the most basic movie scene. And that is why I appreciated the movie more than I enjoyed it. It's only 73 minutes long, but with no real story to follow, just scene after scene of Allan Gray wandering around seeing weird stuff it seems longer and kind of wears out its welcome before the end comes around. Interestingly audiences at the time of release agreed with me and did not much enjoy the movie. It ended up being considered a failure, both artistically and financially. It has been rediscovered since then and is now regarded as a masterpiece. However, I find it more than a little hypocritical that the same critics who call this a masterpiece and forgive the movie's complete lack of logic and plot and character development in the interests of visual effects will rail at every single movie that comes out of Hollywood now that is effects driven, whining like little girls that those effects come at the cost of plot or character development. I am going to need a lengthy essay from each and every one of them telling me the difference. While I'm waiting, I'll wrap this up-if you're a true student of cinema I would recommend this as an important touchstone in the development of the art, everyone else, not so much.financially.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is the most complete and powerful movie I have ever seen.  Never before have I come across a film with such a powerful plot, breathtaking visuals, unforgettable characters, and amazing music all jampacked into one DVD. I know, you film critics out there are probably reading this review thinking, \\"Wow, have you even started watching the Godfather?\\" And yes, I've actually watched the whole thing, but that certainly isn't a film that I can enjoy with my children.   Now I know most Americans are probably already familiar with the plot of The Lion King, but chances are that if you're searching this review board, you haven't seen the movie and you're interested as to what takes place over the course of the film. Let me just start by saying that I would give this movie a million stars if Amazon.com hadn't set the max at five. The being said, let's delve into what gives this movie its supreme quality.   I'm not some professional movie critic, but I think that any great movie should strike a balance between plot and action. For example, The Matrix and Gandhi are both really well-made films, but you'd be lucky not to have a heart attack by the end of The Matrix or fall asleep by the end of Gandhi. Lol! The Lion King, on the other hand, builds up the plot through each passing minute, while simultaneously hitting you with action when you least expect it.    The Lion King opens up on a land called Pride Rock with the birth of Simba, son of Mufasa, the king of the lions. Scar, Mufasa's brother, despises the birth of Simba. since Simba will be heir to the throne once Mufasa dies. Once Simba grows up to be around 8 or 9 (at least he acts that way =] ), Scar starts stirring up trouble, leading to a series of events that put Simba in grave danger. Mufasa dies in an attempt to save Simba (I literally cried during this scene), and Scar, being the terrible villain that he is, convinces Simba that the only reason Mufasa died is because Simba put him in that situation. Thisexchange between Scar and Simba brings about the famous words:    Simba: \\"What should I do?\\"  Scar: \\"Run, Simba. Run away, and never return.\\"       And with that, Simba, who is technically the king at this point, runs out of his kingdom and into the wilderness. In the jungle, he meets Timon and Pumba, some of my favorite Disney characters ever. These two clowns teach Simba a worry-free lifestyle, and before long, Simba has grown up to be a young adult. Meanwhile, back in Pride Rock the evil hyenas have taken over, leaving the lions in a miserable, starving state. Nala, Simba's best buddy from childhood, leaves Pride Rock to search for help. Long story short, she finds Simba, they make love, Simba refuses to go back, Simba gets sense knocked into him by a wise monkey named Rafiki, and finally Simba returns to Pride Rock and challenges Scar.    The plot may seem simple, but this is the one of the few films that reaches the point that words can no longer describe what you're feeling, you know? Like I could keep telling you the basics, but you would never understand the emotional connection that I feel every time I pop this movie into the DVD player. No film I've ever watched has had such a strong influence on my view of life, because on its deepest level, the movie is essentially a spiritual journey for self-discovery. I know you probably think I'm crazy, but we'll get more into that later.   Some films can make you laugh, others can make you cry, The Lion King can do both. A couple weeks ago, my family and I sat down one night and decided to watch it from beginning to end. The \\"Circle of Life,\\" by Elton John, blared out of my Dolby 5.1 surround-sound system. I was immediately alert and excited for the classic I was about to watch. Then came the scene in which Simba and Mufasa were playing around under the stars, and a wave of emotion flooded me as I remembered my dad; the connection the scene created was simply unbelievable. And then, of course, came the scene where Scar killed Mufasa. Probably one of the saddest moments ever to grace the silver screen, this scene didn't quite make me cry, but I was filled with a strange emptiness, as if the loss was my own. The level at which The Lion King made a connection with me was so great that I felt Simba's pain, even thought I kept telling myself that it was just a movie. However, all was well and good half an hour later when Timon and Pumba started doing the Hula Dance, which brought my family to tears, tears of laughter. This is one of the funniest moments in any Disney movie, and I've posted the link for those of you who are interested: [...] No film I can remember, not even the classics from the mid-1900s, triggered such a broad range of emotions from me and my family.   The animation and musical score of The Lion King were not only amazing during the 90s, but they remain a force even today. The music in particular touched me on a pretty personal level. \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" always brings me back to a time shortly after I'd graduated from college, in which all my friends had girlfriends, and I felt more and more like Timon, alone and friendless. It's just amazing how this movie manages to evoke emotions linked to such specific parts of my life, which is more reason to appreciate the sheer power of this film.    The characters are also timeless. James Earl Jones does Mufasa's voiceover to perfection, giving him the authority of a true king. Scar is one of the most evil villains in Disney history, and I still get chills when Scar has Simba in the same position as he had Mufasa before he died. In this scene, Scar grabs Simba's paws and says, \\"And here's my little secret. I...killed...Mufasa.\\" Unforgettable. Timon and Pumba essentially work to counteract the drama that Scar creates. They are just so lovable that they loosen the movie's dramatic mood and make you feel more relaxed. Overall, I'd say there's an excellent balance of drama and humor.    The Lion King achieves iconic status not only through its emotional power and production quality, but also because of its appeal to all age groups. I know it's a truly entertaining watch for you young folks out there, but it becomes much more interesting as you grow older and start to appreciate its symbolic value. The movie accurately depicts the journey of life: you start off innocent and insecure, you go through a phase when nothing matters, and by the time you're an adult, you find responsibility and wisdom. In terms of the actual film, Simba started as a young troublemaker, then he found Timon and Pumba and adopted the phrase \\"Hakuna Matata (no worries),\\" and finally Simba \\"grew\\" up, recognized his responsibility, and saved his kingdom. We each go through this every day, and while it is oftentimes a great struggle to make the responsible decision, we are bound by our responsibilities, and there is no escaping them. This is akin to when Simba tried to leave Pride Rock forever, only to go back many years later when he realized the consequences of his actions. In other words, The Lion King makes a big effort to teach kids that neglecting responsibility can be a terrible mistake. And let me tell you, this is by no means the only life lesson this movie puts out there.   The Lion King is overflowing with words of wisdom. While kids could use these lessons for obvious reasons, I can tell you from personal experience that I have watched The Lion King during times in which I've been depressed or sidetracked from my goals in life. The scene in which Rafiki makes Simba reflect on his life is particularly powerful. Every time I watch this therapeutic segment, I get a sense that someone is watching over me, which triggers me to reassess my goals in life. The movie is also very inspirational during rough times, giving me a sense that if I reach deep within myself, I can do things I've always dreamed of. Yeah, it's a pretty generic message, but the way it presents itself gives me chills almost constantly throughout the entire film.   Like all great movies, The Lion King comes full circle by the end of the movie. One of the core themes, the \\"circle of life,\\" shows on the most basic level that animals, or in our case humans, die so that the next generation may live. The film immediately begins with the birth of Simba, and you are taken with Simba on his life journey that results in the birth of his own child. The beginning and ending scenes are almost identical, which really serves as a tribute to Disney's masterful production quality. Throughout Simba's spiritual journey of self-discovery, I could often relate to the obstacles facing Simba on his bumpy path. For example, I had a really powerful connection with my dad, and when Mufasa died, I really felt a pang of sadness. At the same time, I fully understood why Simba coped with his loss the way he did, and when the moment of self-recognition finally came years later, Simba was ready for it. I know some of you are probably frowning at this point, thinking, \\"Ok, Disney clearly did not intend for the movie to be this deep. Stop hyper-analyzing the children's movie!\\" But that is exactly what makes this film so moving, because Disney did intend to stir up your emotions, even on a spiritual level!    I'm having trouble putting this into words, but I want you all to understand that his movie contains principles which you should base your life on. This isn't just some kids movie; it will take each and every one of you on a spiritual journey, and by the movie's end, if you've really paid attention and taken it all in, you will walk away with a new and inspired view of life. I really can't tell you how much this movie helped me during difficult times throughout my life, and I remain infinitely thankful, as this movie has often turned my life around. I know, you'd think I'd be talking about God or something, but no, I really do mean every word of this review. The Lion King has the power to change your life. Yes, it has the terrific animations, music, and characters, and all of those would be great reasons for a movie critic to give it five stars. But I'm no movie critic. I'm a loving parent who has come a long way from when I was as a kid, and every time I watch Simba grow up, I can't help but feel that I'm watching a shortened version of my life. If you haven't seen The Lion King yet, do yourself a favor and watch it at some point in the next week. Some of you may walk away thinking it's just another movie, but hey, you never know; some of you may very well walk away with a new understanding of your place in the circle of life.
B001ECDVYK|5.0|The disc is great. (My first Canadian import, more on the way) Allience's BD is astonishing in picture and sound quality, compared to the Dimension DVD; the sound is tops, very balanced with strong bass (&LFE). The voices were clear. I say so, have good gear and the disc is very good. ( I thought I should give it a close eye&ear and I say it's A-OK) These HD days, you have to adjust the sound, when it's powerful and that's good,right?<br />I saw this film at an opening week at the CINERAMA Dome in L.A. and half way through the movie, half the audience walked out. Are you man or woman enough for FROM DUSK TILL DAWN in 1080p?
B000UR9QIK|5.0|This Movie looks so Great On Blu-ray Its nice to see My Fav. Movie of all time be on Hi-Def. For anyone who Hasn't seen this I would forsure pick this one up. The best Zombie Film ever made.<br /><br /> When I first seen this movie I feel in Love with it.  Its the best Zombie movie ever made so far. You can't beat or mess with any of George A. Romero Classic Zombie Films. Since he opened the door for so many Other Zombie movies, games and comic books out there. If it wasn't for Dawn Of The Dead, Zombie Movies wouldn't be any good at all.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|Good action movie to watch with a date or a group of people. a lot of action you wont want to leave your seat.
6301973461|5.0|If you are a fan of The Wall, then you owe it to yourself to have it both on the widescreen DVD AND the fullscreen VHS versions! The DVD version definitely shows more musically and visually, however the fullscreen VHS version is more in-your-face just like the movie itself. They both provide 2 different experiences with The Wall and I really enjoy them both! Although I agree with David Gilmour to some extent it being \\"really black and bleek\\", but not as much as the artwork may lead you to believe! Great references on everything from Syd to Roger's childhood to life as a rock star and everything in between! Your Floyd collection isn't complete until you grab this!
B001DHXT20|5.0|Alot better then the first movie, as long as you remember that this is a comic book version so it should not be realistic but just intertaining. alot of action .

B00005JPS8|5.0|One of the best comic-book movies ever! That comes from a big-time comic-book and comic-book movie fan. Everything felt right. Robert Downey JR was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. Jeff Bridges still plays a bad guy as well as anybody onscreen. Gweneth Paltrow IS Pepper Potts in look and characterization. Marvel hit one out of the ballpark with this movie.    The story updates the characters for a more modern look and feel. Instead of Vietnam we are in the middle east. Yet, the update is so true to who the characters are that they never lose track of how things should be. The first Iron-Man armor is crudely built to escape from the bad guys. Tony Stark's motivation for being Iron-Man is stronger than his comic book's version. Here he is fighting to undo the bad (Stark's company selling weapons for war usage) by becoming Iron-Man.    Once back home Tony goes through a few Iron Man armors which fits in perfectly with his comic book history. I don't say this with a grain of salt, this is one of the best comic book movies ever! It stays very true to the comics but also adds to the characters. We almost know what's coming but the movie still surprises. It's one of the rare comic book movies that holds up in repeat viewings. I'd put this up with the first two Spidey movies. first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's and the current Batman movies & X-Men 2. This movie is so good (and I was skeptical going in because I always liked Iron Man) that I wonder how they will top it in the sequel. It's going to be fun finding out.    I don't even recommend renting this movie. BUY IT! Nuff said.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Iron Man is one of the more successful Marvel adaptations and Robert Downey Jr captures the carefree Tony Stark very well.<br />When he realizes that his company is supplying terrorists after his capture and the selfless help of his fellow prisoner who allows him to escape at the cost of his own life, Stark is a changed man.<br />His literal heart has some problems, which reflects the virtual heart that he develops during the course of the movie.<br />He is affected deeply and begins trying to use his vast fortune to try to alter the direction of his company.<br />However, Jeff Bridges' character is totally vested in the system and sets out to prevent a change in the power structure and eventually transforms from being mentor to foe. He fully inhabits this character and those familiar with his work will find him at first nearly unrecognizable, yet his acting talent is displayed to excellent effect.<br />He makes a surprisingly good villain, supplying the \\"badness\\" all heroes need as a foil to their \\"goodness.\\"<br />The ending news conference is somewhat surprising, but on reflection, totally in character for the reckless Iron Man.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I love this series in all it's campy splendor.. It's really an aquired taste, but there is no other show outhere to compare. This season in particular is really great. I was initially upset to loose Rose, then Martha, and didn't particularly like Donna to begin with, but she has developed into (in my opinion) the best companion. Part mother, part sister, she has really been halarious to watch! she has been like a spring board for all the episodes, the corner stone. Her life and family make the doctors' adventure shine.<br />I hope the next doctor does as well as David Tennant, he is the heart of this show. I almost didn't continue watching it when they switched actors for the doctor, but is has just grown better and better. I have all four seasons on dvd, and rarely ever watch the first season with the other doctor. He is leaving huge shoes to fill!

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|Well, we know now that The Dark Knight was the top ticket-taker of the year, possibly even the whole decade, and kudos to it for that accomplishment. But just simply being the highest-grossing movie of the year is not the same thing as being the best. In all honesty, TDK is one of the worst highest-grossing films in history. Don't get me wrong, TDK is still a decent movie, but it defies logic and reasonability that it became the biggest movie of the year. The primary reason it took in so much money was because of the immoderate and inordinate hype surrounding it due mainly in part to Heath Ledger's death. People were understandably curious about seeing it after so much hype was pumped into it. Well, we all know what they say about great expectations. I saw this movie and I can't say I see what all the damn hype is about.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is above-average as far as comic book movies go, but it is simply undeserving of the excessive praise and ridiculously extravagant claims that it is 'the best movie of all time' as I've heard some people state or that it's oscar-worthy. It's not. Sorry, but it really isn't. It was good, but it was no better than any other professionally-mounted movie of the year. Several other comic-book/action movies of the year such as Iron Man, Indiana Jones, Hellboy II and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ALL had FAR better stories. That was one of my main grievances with TDK in that it just didn't have a very interesting or involving enough story. Parts of it lagged and there were too many scenes of long, extraneous dialogue that were, well, boring. I even found myself glancing at my watch more than once, I'm sorry to say. The one term I keep hearing everyone say over and over about this film is that it is 'layered' and that's part of its problem because it has too many subplots and is too busy to focus on any one thing in particular. 'Layered' is just a fancy term for 'crammed full of too many subplots' (The Joker, Batman and Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent's crusade to save Gotham, Gotham's organized crime syndicates, Bruce Wayne and Rachel, Harvey Dent/Two-Face) and that's certainly the case here. There's even an unnecessary early subplot in the film where Bruce Wayne must travel to Hong Kong as Batman to catch a white-collar Chinese criminal that could have ----- and SHOULD have ----- been avoided. I also didn't care much for Maggie Gylenhaal as Katie Holmes' replacement of Rachel Dawes, as her character was responsible for a large portion of the afforementioned longwinded, boring dialogue and marginal acting. She was unattractive, wasn't that great and I wasn't impressed with her. There's literally enough material in TDK for a good two movies at least, and shoehorning them all into one makes me not care about any of them. The movie ends up being a tad overly long as a result and honestly needed to be about 35 to 40 minutes shorter. Christopher Nolan could have at least deferred and stretched some of TDK's material over into the next movie.<br /><br />I did like Heath Ledger as the Joker and while there's certainly nothing wrong with his performance, it's not oscar-worthy and it's less fun than Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker in the original 1989 Batman. (By the way, it's going to start sending a bad message if every actor who dies on set of a movie during filming or immediately thereafter automatically gets considered for an oscar.) Too many of the Joker's traits and comic-book trademarks were unecessarily compromised for this film. I didn't like the fact that Ledger's Joker isn't like a gleeful clown-pimp with bone-white skin anymore, he's just a homicidal maniac in face paint. Jack Nicholson's Joker wasn't just a nutzoid freak in white makeup and Courtney Love-inspired red lipstick, his skin was actually bleached white that way and his face frozen in a Sardonicus-like grin from his fall into the acid in the 1989 film, which was much more true to the comic-book origin. Ledger's Jokerdidn't have a hideous frozen grin on his face, his mouth is just carved into grin and his constant asking of \\"you wanna know how I got my scars?\\" throughout the movie got on my nerves. While Ledger's Joker is unique and watchable, overall I have to say that Jack Nicholson's Joker was more spot-on and stayed truer to the comic book.<br /><br />TDK does have enough redeeming qualities to make it worth seeing, however. Like its predecessor, Batman Begins, TDK has the same impressive sets and marvelously done visuals that made the first film good. There are nice compositions and color scales that effectively duplicate the garish look of a comic book without going so far as to make it unbelievable. It has great visual style and definite real-world texture and feel to it. To the movie's credit, one particular scene near the climax is very exciting, where Batman must fight his way through a high-rise building filled with the Joker's goons, hostages and SWAT team police to get to The Joker at the building's top, mapping his way with a sonar imaging camera all the way throughout the building. But Christopher Nolan just isn't really adept at action sequences ; this scene was for the most part too dark and the editing done too fast to tell what was going on. While TDK has many of the same good elements from BB, the biggest one that is missing from the first film is the excellent characterization of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins. Batman is barely even a supporting character in this movie, taking a backseat to the monstrousness of the Joker and Harvey Dent's crusade and plight as newly crowned District Attorney of Gotham City. Christian Bale's Batman in this movie doesn't really seem like Batman, he just comes across as a big, super-armored thug as few other reviewers have already mentioned. I also found his raspy, gravelly voice he uses as Batman to be irritating and distracting. Why does he insist on doing this? Does he do this so no one will recognize Bruce Wayne's voice? Who the hell else in Gotham City could afford a hundred-thousand dollar kevlar batsuit??!? Please. And why would he use the voice as Batman around other characters who already know his secret identity anyway??!!?<br /><br />For me, TDK's biggest flaw ------ one that I'm surprised more people haven't noticed ------ is its near-total lack of any element of fun. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be dark, grim and gritty but there's next to no comic-relief or humour present. What very little humour there is comes courtesy almost exclusively via deadpan performances and lines from Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, not coincidently in the fact that they were both two of the best things about Batman Begins. Sorry, but the 1989 Batman beats TDK out in the fun department.<br /><br />Overall, TDK is an above-average action movie but seriously overrated and far from flawless. I probably would have actually enjoyed this film MORE if everyone hadn't killed it for me before I even saw it through so much inordinate praise and hype. It's not the outstanding masterpiece so many people have suggested it is and trying to place this movie in the same category of film excellence such as Citizen Kane or Bridge on the River Kwai is not only a discredit to this movie itself but also to individuals themselves making such preposterous, extravagant claims. TDK's excessive praise goes beyond exaggeration, it has reached the point of just plain absurdity.

The only difference is this book is easy to read which, to me, made it a bit too selfish. The book was all about me, me, me rather than teaching the deeper meanings of the law of attraction.    All about how to get the love and money and status you want, rather than teaching the importance of giving which works in the same way but is more fulfilling.
1591841666|1.0|This book is unspired and is made of old information. The content seems to be a patchwork of Mr. Godin's blog posts. Feel that I may have been duped into buying this when the info is old and redundant.  I like Mr. Godin and believe that he has some tidbits of wisdom but this book is over-hyped and a poor offering.  The themes are weak, the case studies are typical[Google, Wikipedia, every other internet buzz word] and there are no revelations.  Not worth the time or money.

B001GQ2TGA|1.0|In thinking back on all the CD's I've purchased in 2008, this one has to be one of the more disappointing ones for me. There just wasn't a single cut on it that made me really say WOW! It was predictable and it was boring. The one song (O Come, O Come Emmanuel) started off with promise then descended into a very odd arrangement on the refrain.<br />I can't recommend this at all.
B001C46P2A|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's (\\"Romeo + Juliet\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\") new film \\"Australia\\" pretty much defines the term 'sweeping epic'. And Luhrmann has created a film that is three things.<br /><br />Very sweeping. Very epic. And very long.<br /><br />Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, \\"Moulin Rouge\\", \\"The Others\\"), an uptight English woman, arrives in Australia to convince her husband to sell their ranch and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Upon her arrival, she finds Drover (Hugh Jackman, \\"X-Men\\", \\"The Prestige\\") and takes an immediate dislike to the crude hired hand. But he is her transportation through the Outback and they set off on the arduous journey. Upon their arrival at the ranch, she finds her husband has been killed and she stands to lose everything unless she can drive her cattle to port, to fulfill an Army contract, before the evil cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown, \\"FX\\") can use his considerable resources to fulfill the contract. Her only choice is to ask Drover to help her out. They enlist the aid of the Aboriginal people who work the ranch, including Nullah (Brandon Walters), a half white Aboriginal boy. When Nullah's mother dies, Sarah cares for the boy and tries to protect him from the government forces intent on taking him away from his mother and Sarah. The trek is treacherous and made all the more difficult by Carney's right hand man, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham, \\"300\\"). But the cattle make it to port and Sarah is able to fix up the ranch. Then World War II threatens their Eden and everyone must help out in the war effort.<br /><br />Baz Luhrmann's films are, if nothing else, visual. And \\"Australia\\" doesn't disappoint in that regard. Luhrmann seems to have a fascination with picture books or pop-up books, because this influence continually reappears in his last few films. In \\"Moulin Rouge\\", he framed practically every image in deep reds and created 2-D frames for give the film a very stylized look, never allowing us to forget we were being transported into the director's inner mind, a journey many disliked. In \\"Australia\\", a fictionalized epic, he can't do this type of thing as much, but he certainly gets away with it more often than you might expect. The film begins with Nullah narrating the arrival of Lady Ashley and the beginning of the story, much like a parent might tell a bedtime story. But Nullah is relating a legend. He is Aboriginal and his people learn about their history and their way of life through recounting their legends. After a few minutes, he stops himself and we go backwards, to before her arrival, to get more of the details.<br /><br />Luhrmann's style is very graphic and he seems less concerned with getting meaningful or authentic performances from his actors. Occasionally, he achieves this, but it almost seems to be an accident. In \\"Moulin Rouge\\", every performer appears to be trying to achieve the live action equivalent of a comic book character. Shouting, mugging, laughing too hard, every emotion is too broad and too big. But it works. And \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is one of my favorite films of all time. In \\"Australia\\", Luhrmann is going for something a bit more natural, and this works less well. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman topiline the cast, and they are both good, but unremarkable. They almost get lost in the epic and sweeping nature of the story.<br /><br />As much as Luhrmann wants to present a slice (a very large slice) of the history of his birthplace, these theatrical flourishes tend to depreciate the actor's performances. At one point, the camera sweeps in on Bryan Brown who plays the villainous cattle baron King Carney, as he laughs maniacally and the gold filling in his tooth sparkles on cue. If Luhrmann were really interested in presenting a slice of history, or dare I say, an Oscar contender, he would have held these artistic flourishes (excesses?) in check.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays Lady Sarah Ashley, a very uptight English woman who reluctantly travels to Australia to encourage her husband to sell the ranch they own and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Kidman's character is the typical uptight noble woman it almost seems every English woman is required to be. Why? Because she must transform before the end of the film. She will transform from the frigid, proper, uptight English woman and become less rigid, more romantic, and more open and all of this will be caused by \\"Australia\\". She will become a WOMAN in this strange, unusual land.<br /><br />Story events lead her to become the de-facto mother for Nullah. Initially, she is very cool and aloof to him. When he experiences a personal tragedy, she approaches and crouches down and says \\"There. There\\" in the most impersonal way someone could. While this moment is necessary, I never really felt like Ashley and Nullah ever have a true bond. Yes, they cry when they are separated, they cry when they are reunited. They cry. And cry. But it doesn't always feel real.<br /><br />Naturally, because Lady Ashley is so uptight, she will take to the Australian outback as naturally as a cat to water. Everything about the Outback will be a test for her. Can she open up and adapt? Or will she run back to England never to return? And if she dislikes the Outback, she will dislike Drover (Jackman) IMMENSELY. At least at first. Drover is the pure embodiment of everything the Out back is. Laid back. Rugged. Determined. Strong willed. And, of course, Jackman is very handsome, so Kidman's Ashley has to be drawn to him as well. But there will be, at first, clashes and fireworks.<br /><br />And this is another problem with \\"Australia\\". It's so damn predictable. If you've ever seen a movie like \\"Gone With The Wind\\" or \\"Out of Africa\\", you will recognize most of \\"Australia\\". Apparently, Luhrmann shot a few alternative endings and let some test audiences determine which one was included in the film. What he chose, based on their reactions, was the most acceptable, most recognizable, more predictable ending offering no surprises or to help set the film apart.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is good as Drover, the rugged man of the Earth who becomes a reluctant ally to Lady Ashley. Initially, they unite to join forces against King Carney. Then, they unite to... well, unite.<br /><br />Drover is a good old boy who 'works for no man' and feels very comfortable sleeping on the range, maybe more comfortable than in a bed. He gets in drunken brawls, he drives horses and cattle, and he rarely shaves and looks great riding a horse. And Lady Ashley doesn't know what to think of him.<br /><br />At one point early on, Lady Ashley sits next to the fire on their initial trip to her ranch. Luhrmann then begins panning the camera across Jackman's broad, defined back as he soaps himself down. Soon, he reaches down for a bucket of water and douses it over himself. As the camera lingers over his torso, many women and gay men should thank Luhrmann for this piece of soft-core porn. Really, the camera moves in much the same way a Playboy video would capture a bunny washing a car. Oh, did I get that wet?<br /><br />And naturally, Ashley does a double take and realizes she is staring wantonly at her hired hand. She quickly composes herself.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Drover and Ashley struggle with the idea of a relationship and what that means to each of them, providing a little of the conflict in their relationship. But this isn't really the part of the story Luhrmann cares about telling, so it remains in the background.<br /><br />If Luhrmann had confined his story to the tale of the cattle drive, the resulting film would be better. Just as predictable, but better. But it isn't enough for Luhrmann to simply tell the story of the love of these two disparate individuals. He has to tell an 'important' story, an 'epic' story. So, he sets it against both the backdrop of World War II and includes the story of the Lost Ones. Both of these stories are interesting, butseem to have been tacked on as after thoughts.<br /><br />The better addition is the story of Nullah and what the Australian government did to all half-caste Aboriginals they could get their hands on. They uprooted these children, the product or sexual intercourse between a white man and an Aboriginal woman, and sent them to isolated areas, to be educated, to live together, to be held captive. Removed from their parents, the government was doing two things; trying to hide the evidence of affairs involving powerful white men and trying to make the children more acceptable to the community. And this happened for a shockingly long period of time.<br /><br />Luhrmann thrusts us into the middle of this dramatic piece of Australia's history allowing us to experience it through Lady Ashley's eyes, through Nicole Kidman's performance.<br /><br />Despite a few references throughout to the impending war, the last hour of \\"Australia\\" seems tacked on. There is a very clear division between two of the stories; when the cattle drive ends, we then pick up the threat of war. And because of this, the war sequence only serves to make the film seem longer than it already is.<br /><br />And it's long.<br /><br />Many people are making references to \\"Gone With The Wind\\" when they discuss \\"Australia\\" and I see the connection. They are very similar in scope, story, two strong leads, etc. And if you have seen \\"GWTW\\" or \\"Out of Africa\\", which I think is a better comparison, you will recognize most of \\"Australia\\" as you sit and watch it. And because Luhrmann is much more restrained with his over the top visual style, we are left watching a fairly predictable film.<br /><br />The question for you is can you sit through two hours and forty-five minutes of a predictable film?film apart.

0316010669|2.0|I was looking forward to reading Blink.  The combination of an interesting topic and critical acclaim had me excited.    The first few chapters of Blink were moderately intriguing.  Gladwell seemed to be getting at the point that thin-slicing (drawing instantaneous conclusions subconsciously) is both powerful and accurate.  Then the book starts to wander though and the reader is presented with many examples of thin-slicing being incorrect and even deadly.  Gladwell then wraps it up (sort of) by offering that sometimes thin-slicing yields correct conclusions and sometimes it yields incorrect conclusions.  Really?  That seems like a trivial thesis and one that I probably didn't need to read 300 pages to reach.  The material in this book could have been parsed significantly and served as the basis of an article, with greater final effect than this book.    Although there are some good stories along the way, I doubt many readers will find it hard to put this book down at points.  Those that truly enjoy it will probably do so more for the anecdotes than because it offers any deep insight.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Good movie. Not amazing like i had been told. Ledger does do a good Joker, but Jack Nicholson's 'Joker' portrayal is just as good....Nicholson's was just a different style. If you liked 'Batman Begins' you'll like 'The Dark Knight.' After watching the movie I just felt that it got way too much hype. I honestly don't think this movie was better than the \\"original\\" Batman starring Michael Keaton. I could be biased since i saw 'Batman' first, as a kid. But, to each his own. Worth the buy though.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|To say that `Tropic Thunder' isn't funny is to be blind.  Really, if you can't find the humor in a group of talented comedians (and one very talented dramatic actor) taking on Hollywood, one politically incorrect joke at a time, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies.  Maybe you take life too seriously.<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />I will not say that `Tropic Thunder' is a perfect comedy, but in all honesty it is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.  For the most part it is smartly written, and it is flawlessly acted (just give Robert Downey Jr. the Oscar now).  The film never lags and it never ceases to entertain.  My one complaint is that towards the middle of the film a lot of the jokes tend to feel a tad recycled, as if they are just circulating with the same joke just spoken a different way.  It's not constant and it doesn't last the entire length of the film (and Robert Downey Jr. especially works hard to make even the most regurgitated of jokes feel fresh) but it is there.<br /><br />The film tells the story about a group of actors (the action hero, the corny comedian and the dramatic Oscar winner; or, in other words, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Russell Crowe) who are hired to film a film adaptation of a war veterans memoir.  The problem is that the actors are having a bit of trouble connecting with the script.  That is when the director decides to drop them off in the middle of the jungle and just film raw footage of them roughing it.  The problem is that the actors don't know that what is happening around them isn't part of the movie, so when their director explodes they think it is some really cool special effects, and when the films star Tugg Speedman is kidnapped he thinks it is all part of the movie.  Thankfully Kirk Lazarus (the white method actor who's died his skin black for the movie) is a little smarter than everyone else.<br /><br />Hollywood is definitely ripped a new one here, but the fact of the matter is that it is funny because it's so true (not to this extreme, but come one, this is one accurate satire).  The stereotypical depictions are about as extreme as Hollywood likes to paint them to be, and that adds weight to the films message.  The performances by both Downey and Cruise (both Golden Globe nominees!!!) are surely the most controversial in the bunch, but also the most enjoyable.  They attack their characters with fervor and dedication.  They are having a great time, but they are also taking their performances seriously, and this shines through in their presence.<br /><br />I've heard a few people complain that they didn't get a black actor to play a black man.  That is the whole point of the comedy here.  That dispute is even had within the film itself (the hilarious Brandon T. Jackson's character Alpa obviously has a major problem with Kirk being cast in the `black' role).  To attack the film for that decision is to either not have seen the film or merely not have understood it.<br /><br />Find something legit to gripe over.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, from start to finish.  It could have used a little fine tuning with some of the jokes, but the delivery is there every time so it makes up for it.  The action is there, the wit is there and the performances are spot on.  Jack Black is actually really funny here, and Ben Stiller manages to take his typical comedic timing and kick it up a notch, standing out even alongside the films VIP Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />I'd give the film a solid B+, but the acting is a definite A+.<br /><br />Be forewarned; the film is designed to offend you.  It is littered (especially from Downey and Cruise) with profanities, and they attack every Hollywood stereotype from race relations to mental handicaps (\\"full retard\\") and they show no hesitation nor do they make any apologies.  This is a film that is as blunt and as shameless as they come, but that's just all the more reason to love it.this extreme, but come one, this is one accurate satire).

B0002KVULG|1.0|I wanted to like this.  I guess that goes without saying, right?  I mean, we always want to watch a good movie.  So I guess the better way to say it would be that I was expecting this to be a good movie.<br /><br />It isn't.<br /><br />I hear that it seemed like a really good idea at the time, so maybe I can understand why they went ahead with the film.  Frank Langella had revived Dracula on the stage and so bringing him to the screen seemed like a smart move.  Sadly, Langella is the worst part of this movie.<br /><br />We all know the story of Dracula, the undead ladies man with a taste for that warm red stuff that runs through your veins.  In `Dracula' we meet Count Dracula after the ship he is on wrecks and he is washed ashore.  He's found and nursed to health and is taken to by young Mina Van Helsing.  He kills her.  Then Dracula begins to court the likes of Lucy Seward, the beautiful friend of the late Mina, all the while Mina's father Abraham is trying to find his daughters killer.<br /><br />Director John Badham really tries to give `Dracula' depth of darkness, but the chunky script provided by W.D. Richter really messes things up.  You mix the lackluster script with Badham's brooding direction and you have a rather boring adaptation instead of what could have been intelligent and disturbing.  The special effects are a highlight, at least some of them, but Langella's ridiculous hair and makeup make a lot of what could have been neat appear to be nothing more than a joke.  Watching him scale a wall is rather funny.<br /><br />Speaking of Langella, could he be any more boring?<br /><br />The acting here is a big sore spot.  I remember hearing people claim that this was closest Langella ever came to an Oscar nomination.  How?  He was stiff and completely lacking of any charm.  Worse yet, when he was supposed to be eerie and scary he was hokey and borderline comical.  I couldn't see any reason why any woman would be drawn to him.  Donald Pleasence and Laurence Olivier aren't much better really.  In fact, the only highlight I can think of is the luminous Kate Nelligan who actually convinces as the swooning and manipulated Lucy.<br /><br />I'd skip this one, entirely.  There are many other vampire films with real edge, with a little more bite so-to-speak.  If you want a good unintentional laugh then put this one in.  You can even hit mute.  Watching Langella drift around in the darkness looking like a gothic clown is pretty hysterical.nly highlight I can think of is the luminous Kate Nelligan who actually convinces as the swooning and manipulated Lucy.

My all time favorite band is U2 which I've seen numerous times live and own all their live CDs and live concert DVDs but the power and brilliance put out on Secret World Live CD is truly mind blowing.      The versions of the songs Secret World, Red Rain, Sledgehammer, In your Eyes are much much better than the studio versions in my opinion.  If you have a good sound system the difference is readily apparent with all the tiny nuances of the many instruments utilized and the bass and drums in particular thump.    I have listened to this CD over and over, still am not bored of it and and no other live performance CD from any artist comes close.

1595141979|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. As a fan of Mead's previous two books in this series, I was excited to see that this one was thicker...yay, more story! Well, it didn't take long to figure out why the book was thicker. It was filled with an excess of telling rather than showing. I also had a problem with the over use of the word 'had'. It really made for a lot of passive sentences...and passive sentences make for a slow moving book.     I got frustrated with the over-explainations of everything. I know this is a series so sometimes we need to be reminded of things that happened in previous books, but this is the third, we didn't need a recap on why Strigoi are bad and how some Moroi use spirit OR what Spirit actually is. Those are just two of many examples of where the story goes into   \\"telling\\" right in the middle of \\"showing\\". The action was often broken up with Rose's thoughts or memory or something else that didn't move the action along.     I found myself skimming through chunks of rehashing and I didn't miss anything important. I didn't find any of this in the first two books, or if I did, it wasn't in the excess that it was in Shadow Kiss.     Mild Spoiler below*****          The love scene between Rose and Dimitri was kinda disapointing. On one hand, I was very happy that they got together, but it was all very bland. I didn't feel any passion, despite being told it was passionate and loving and wonderful...but that's just it, we were TOLD that it was passionate instead of describing how Rose was unable to control herself, how she may have moaned or how Dimitri may have goaned. Things like that let us understand the passion. It's like this line sums it up perfectly: \\"I wish I had the words to describe sex, but nothing I can say would really capture how amazing it was.\\"   Well, I wish she would have found the words. I didn't want it to be erotica. I understand that this is YA, but it could have had more passion. Maybe Mead isn't comfortable writing thatkind of stuff and that's fine, it just left me wanting more.     I did like the book, despite what it sounds like. I just felt like Mead got in her own way of telling a tight story. I loved the end, even though it was sad. I get the feeling that Rose is on her way to an awesome adventure and I'll surely be there for it. I just hope that before Mead sends her manuscript off to her editor, she takes an axe to all the, 'he had, she had, we had, I'd had, and had been's' that took over Shadow Kiss.

0743289692|5.0|The history and cultural of Islam learned from this autobiography is well worth the read and bargain at the price.   There is also a recent look at some of the countries in Africa  from the author's experience. Secrets that Islam does not want the outside world to know about them is revealed in great detail in this book.  I consider it a must read, especially for someone who is considering marrying a man in this culture.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I am a crazy fan of SATC so this movie for me was out of this world. I watched it three times at the movie theaters. The special edition version it's awesome, it shows extra scenes they didn't show at the theaters. The movie takes you through a journey of lessons involving friendships and love. I love it!
B000002AH7|4.0|Some say I don't understand Jazz enough to only give this 4 stars.  That may be so - but I played it 3 times and then donated to my public library... I understand that it is important in scholarly Jazz circles - guess my scholarship leans another way.

0060090383|5.0|Marian Keyes really got me hooked with this book. It has got to be one of my favorite women's lit books ever - i enjoy all of the characters and appreciate how real the problems they face are. This book and \\"Lucy Sullivan is getting married\\" are my favorites of hers - both well written, empowering and HUMOROUS which is always a bonus for me. You can't go wrong with this book, its a quick read for being such a long book because its so well written, interesting and realistic. Kudos!
B001F7MSFW|3.0|The sequel has much more fantasy characters in it than the first part.  To bad, that the movie turns from a fantasy action flick into a chick flick.  If there will be a Hell Boy part 3; PLEASE leave the romance to a minimum.

B001CDLATE|5.0|While blockbuster hits are fun to watch, Baraka gets you to the roots of humanity and the world we live in.  Filmed in 57 Countries around the world, you get to see the vast variety of cultures that humans live in.  This movie also focuses on nature as well, and tells it's own story.  With the Blu-Ray version, you get spectacular visual and audio quality compared to the older DVD.  Baraka was shot in 65mm film, so you get a pretty big \\"scope\\" on what the director wanted.  This is an unique format for it's time (1992) and has been preserved to really show off your home theater system.  Picture is 5 stars and audio is 5 stars.  In fact the non-narrative movie is 5 stars as well.  DON'T FORGET TO WATCH THE MAKING OF THE FILM.  This is equally enjoyable as the crew tells many unique stories during filming.  This Blu-Ray is a MUST HAVE!  Enjoy......
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This latest release of Enya's is wonderfully soothing even though it has a Christmas theme to it. You'll enjoy the flow of her melodies and beautiful singing and harmonies. Though it is not her best, it has a peaceful quality to it and could be played at anytime of the year. If your an Enya fan, you should at least have this for your collection.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|Granted, it didn't cost but a few dollars more than the single disc, but the \\"extras\\" here are laughable.  You get a featurette about how Hans Zimmer came up with the theme for the Joker... all two notes of it.  Great theme, yes, but do we really need ten minutes of watching him have a cello player play two notes repeatedly?  Then you get the scenes originally shot in IMAX in their IMAX format.  Great.  While they're clearer, on a TV it's not a big bonus.    Totally uninteresting is a featurette on the batsuit; the bat-cycle is slightly more, but not much.    Here's what it doesn't have:    -NO commentary, director or otherwise (EDIT: Wayne just informed me Nolan doesn't do commentaries, so that explains that)  -NO making-of featurette  -NO interviews with cast and crew  -NO deleted/alternate scenes  -NO SFX featurettes on how they did certain scenes    In other words, none of the standard bonus features you'd expect from a ONE disc set, much less two.  They obviously rushed this out for the holidays and are going to hit us all up a second time for a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" containing all the things that the advertising suggested would be in this one.  You've been had.    However, if you really, really must have it now, yes: it looks and sounds great and as superhero movies go, it doesn't get any better than this.  Heath Ledger just makes the movie.  So, buy it if you must have it to watch now--but for your permanent copy, unfortunately, you're going to have to wait for the DVD that has all the stuff you thought was on this one.
0321344758|5.0|Steven Krug's Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition will make you rethink how you look at every web page you visit.  This book was reading for my Internet Marketing college course and this was possible the most interesting read I have ever been assigned for college.  The book is very short and there's a reason.  Conciseness is a main theme of the book.  It gets right to the point without forcing the reader to read anything unnecessary.  He has very valid points about web page design and format.  Not only are they valid but they should be the rules for any web designer.  If you are a web designer, this book is a must.  If you are a small business owner who wants their website to look and feel like a Fortune 500's, this book is a must.  Anyone involved in web development needs to read this book!  It is a quick and easy read that can make or break your website.

142212312X|4.0|Any community or organization, any family, village or town choosing one book that would make life a little bit better for every resident, employee, citizen or member should pick this book. It is short, it is instructive without being preachy. Drucker is a bit of a grouch and a bit of a wise granddad. Harvard, being Harvard, doesn't discount this book on amazon. Too bad, because they should. If you read this book and kept it to heart, practiced it in your life and helped others to do the same, you would easily replace Harvard Business School and a good deal of its B.A.. It's so good, I'm surprised they don't charge twice as much so they can protect their overrated institutions even more.

B001EN71CW|3.0|[[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]]    Firefly still is a amazing series. Even if its only 14 episodes. However, I was disappointed with the blu-ray version. I don't know if it was the remastering but all the episodes looked uneven, some scenes were high quality and others were grainy. Give me one or the other, not both mashed together. Its not a high-quality blu-ray copy and I wish they spent more time making it look better. In some scenes the blu-ray copy goes extremely bright and you can't see what's going on. As for the blu-ray special features, there are hardly any. Although the Lunch with Joss Whedon is a good addition, it doesn't constitute selling a whole new box set. I would rather stick with the DVD's, they look better. What should of happened is a high-quality blu-ray set with tons of special features, maybe a new episode. However, firefly is still a amazing series and although the blu-ray part should score a 1, firefly is a 5 and brings it up to a 3.

B001GQACGE|3.0|I listened to both CDs and only three songs stood out--Single Ladies, If I Were a Boy, and Diva.  RADIO has a good beat, but it just sounds pure crazy.<br /><br />The main reason why the CDs didn't impress me is not Beyonce', even though she is wayyyyyyy over exposed, but the fact that all the songs sound alike, except for the songs written by someone else.  I really wish she would stop song writing and just sing.<br /><br />Update (12/22) I found another banging song off the CD - Sweet Dreams.  Okay, it would seem that the dance CD is banging; it's the lyrical CD that is causing folks the issues.  BEE stop all the attempts to sing meaningful songs and just make dance hits.

B0015AARJI|3.0|This is the first controller I bought for my ps3. I never liked a lot the Sixaxis that came out with the system, mainly because of the lack of vibratory response. Now dualshock3 is much better, it feels better on your hands since its heavier. And the motion detection works better for me because I actually \\"feel\\" the controller, sixaxis is so light weight that It gets difficult to handle.

If you enjoy that song and are interested in hearing more like it, buy this cd.  I personally enjoy every track on it, my favorite is probably Peace Of Mind.    Highly recommended!
B001GAOY5U|5.0|This movie are amazingly in good quality copy of Blu ray, enjoy to watch this movie with my whole family
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I love the movie. I've seen it many times and was excited about getting the Blu-Ray disc. Unfortunately, I went through two of the discs because they would not play. It turns out the problem has nothing to do with the disc, but with the BDLive content. If you have your Blu-Ray player connected to the Internet, you will likely have problems playing your disc.<br /><br />To get the disc to play, go into your player's SETUP and change the NETWORK permissions for BDLive to either CONFIRM or PROHIBIT. Then try to play your disc again. You should no longer have any problem.<br /><br />I have not found any information on why this is happening, but it's nice to know that I can watch the movie. This is one of the BEST superhero movies to date and rates up there with The Dark Knight.
0312360266|2.0|Not very well written, in my opinion.  Boring.  The main character isn't very likable. I won't bother reading any of the others in this series.

B000KN7BIQ|3.0|I hadn't seen The Sting is decades, so I didn't remember much of anything about it. My oldest son had seen it sometime back and just raved about it, so when I found it on HDDVD for a good price on Amazon, I decided to go ahead and spend some of my birthday money on it. However, although it is a really good movie, it wasn't worth it for me to have purchased it and have it take up space in my DVD cabinet. I try to get & keep only the ones I feel most necessary, and this isn't one of those. It's DEFINITELY worth renting and watching ... once a decade or so, but that's it for me. Now their Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid would be worth purchasing & keeping!

1416562605|5.0|Do you want to better understand the Mumbai siege? Would you like to increase your understanding of contemporary India? Have you wondered how this outsourcing thing has come to pass? Then pick up this page-turning Man Booker Prize winner. The White Tiger is part Confederacy of Dunces and part Life of Pi, with a touch of Machiavelli's The Prince and a little bit of Atlas Shrugged thrown in for good measure.     Our tale is dictated and recorded by the protagonist, Balram Halwai. Given no name but \\"boy\\" because his family worked too hard to think up a real name, Balram is the prototypical Indian entrepreneur.     Upon hearing on the radio that Mr. Jiabao, the Premier of China, will be visiting India to learn about the sub-continent's tremendous entrepreneurial spirit, Balram decides that, for the Premier's sake, he must intervene. Knowing that the official guides will give China's Premier a false account of what is happening in India, Balram takes it upon himself to record his own life story as a means toward understanding the true India.     Told as a collection of spoken recordings, made each night for a week in the wee hours of the morning and addressed directly to Mr. Jiabao, our Bangalore entrepreneur guides the reader, along with the Premier, through modern India as experienced by someone who started out among the poorest of the poor and wound up a wealthy man.     Inspired wit and ignorance, lust and greed, corruption and murder, reason and pride, cunning and madness, luck and careful planning. All play a role in this allegorical work.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is a film like no other. If you expect a deep and complex storyline you will probably end up disappointed but if you want to enjoy some breathtaking imagery and an unusual way of telling a charming story - then you will love this movie.If you were wondering why you invested in a Plasma screen then this will justify your investment !!    What puzzles me is the recommended minimum viewing age (16??). My kids, 9 and 12 are totally enchanted by The Fall and i could see no reason for them not to be watching it.

0316067601|4.0|This book was well written and gave vivid accounts of the events leading to, during and after the incident.  It takes the reader from the light hearted, the hard work to make the selection into this illustrious band of men.  To the heavy hearted and life making decisions they make and the repercussions which evolve. The book describes not only how any Armed force looks after its comrades, but displays how in civilian life, how communities pull together for support of each other.  It outlines what the many Special Forces do every day to make the world a different place, whilst the greater majority of the population would never know it had happened, but should be thankful that it does.    The only down part about the book was the writer insisted on mentioning Navy SEALS on almost every page.. Navy SEALS do it this way, it is the way Navy SEALS are.. etc..etc.  This detracted from what would be an excellent read, almost to a point of frustration.  Especially when in many parts of the book the writer mentions on many occasions how unassuming, quiet and low key these Special Forces operators are.     Enjoy the read..

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|This 2-disc Special Edition DVDs deserve negative stars.  There should be a class action lawsuit against Warner Brothers for misleading/false advertising.  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed The Dark Knight movie.  However, the 2-disc Special Edition DVDs made me vomit.  There were no deleted scenes, no director commentary, no cast and crew interviews, etc. on the second disc.  If Kevin Smith had bought these DVDs he would tell Warner Brothers to smoke his big fat !@#$.  Allow me to make the conjecture that Warner Brothers is going to release an \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of The Dark Knight in order to milk the fans.  I for one would like a refund of my $15 IMAX ticket and $20.99 for the DVDs please.    If you must have The Dark Knight, go with the single disc.

B0001MDP3G|1.0|If you are looking for the same kind of otherworldly feeling in this movie as was found in Charles Frazier's magnificent novel you will be surely disappointed. This film was totally miscast in every respect. First of all in Frazier's novel the southern appalachian mountains of North Carolina were as important a character in the book as the human characters were. So what do the producers do? They film it in Romania in a location that only bears a slight resemblance to one of the most beautiful mountain ranges on earth. For those of us who intimately know the landscape of The Great Smokie mountains such as myself, this is the first great disappointment. There currently exists about 40% virgin wilderness that still appears much like it was back in the civil war time of the novel. But they chose Romania instead where there is not a mountain laurel , tulip poplar or rhododendron bush in sight. Do we feel like we are in the southern appalachians... NO! Then there are the actors. Nicole Kidman is so wrong for the part of Ada I could cry.Her southern accent is weak at best and she reeks hollywood. Think Cate Blanchette instead. Jude Law with his pretty boy face falls flate on it as Inman. I would have rather seen an actor like Damien Lewis of Band of Brothers cast instead. His slim continence and the thousand yard stare that he perfected in that powerful WW2 epic would have fit nicely with the horrors Inman had witnessed from Sparksburg to the nightmare of the Petersburg crater. And lastly there is Renee Zellweger as the mountain girl Ruby. Her inept performance is pure comic characature and the final nail in the coffin of this poorly realized film. If you want to see a movie that actually captures the atmosphere and gritty feeling of civil war times in America, I would suggest the low budget gem Pharoah's Army. Oh what a director such as Terrence Malick might have done with this material. We'll never know now.
0060594896|5.0|This book is easy to read and laid out in away that is easy to make use of the information. The ideas are great, with lots of real life examples. I also listened to the version on CD and that is also a great way to digest the information. But I recommend reading it too, because it was exercises throughout the book to examine how the principles can work in your own life. I wish everyone used these principles in their lives. The world would be a better place!

0316017922|1.0|gladwell has a knack for creating magazine articles that he calls \\"books.\\" in essence cultural pap andpalum for those who read esquire and yet think they are intellectuals. he lacks the intellectual rigor to actually provide true and insightful interpretations of the research that others have done, for it appears gladwell does not do original research. that would require too much work and time. rather he presents the work of others and provides a fluffy overlay that is at once politically correct and self-annointing of his position as cultural critic. the difficulty with this book in particular is that gladwell is essentially arguing that the world provides disadvantages to some, and advantages to others. oh gee, what a revelation. shall we presume that gladwell is not disturbed enough by this that he is donating all but the bare minimum he needs to live to soup kitchens and homeless shelters? hmmm, probably not. an example of the holes in gladwell's thinking is his example of a chris langan. now in his early fifties, langan's tale of woe is due to the fact that he had a difficult childhood (along with what? 6 billion other people on the planet?) and then when he was accepted to college he felt his professors were not appropriately deferential of his (as he believed) intellectual gifts. and so he quit. gladwell apparently feels that this was fine. andyet, those of us who have worked to achieve know that there are always stairs on the way to success requiring deference to those ahead of us. langan also complains that thepublishers won't accept his work and acknowledge his self-proclaimed genius because he doesn't have credentials. ah yes, and i hope a doctor with no credentials is available the next time i need one.....significantly, gladwell doesn't seem to feel that langan should have shown that one element of success that is absolutely necessary to move forward in life--discipline. in essence theproblem with gladwell is that he seems to feel that we are supposed to feel bad that we aren't creating a world in which everyone is exactly equal. fyi...as someone who went to college \\"later in life,\\" the first in my family to graduate from college, and a researcher myself, and who is quite sure that i can think as well as chris langan, let me assure you that my deference to my professors was not always because i thought they were right, but rather because i knew they could teach me to think better and that their work to achieve their position, meant they had a right to my respect and deference. credentials, in essence, say that one has done the work, and because of that, one has the standing to make changes and be respected. i would have liked to be a movie star, but i just am not good looking enough. give me a beer so i can cry...
B000UBMZ4S|1.0|I am very disappointed with this retailer. I have not received my order yet, even though it is more than a week overdue. I emailed the retailer a few days ago, asking that the order be tracked, but have received no response. I think you should remove this retailer from your list.
0312370849|4.0|After the first few chapters into this book, I had to admit to myself that although it wasn't the most skillfully or subtly written novel I have read recently, I was hooked.  This novel moves between a third-person narration of events surrounding a young French Jewish girl in July 1942, and a first person account of an American journalist in France investigating those events in the early 2000's.  This oscillation is done well, the change done at the chapter breaks, and the two stories are interwoven in way that will keep you turning the pages.   The clumsiness I found in awkward plot movement devices in which the reader is told things they need to know in a way that was obvious that we needed to know it.  There was also an over-reliance on cliched  or stock moments (some of the internment camp descriptions especially felt this way, but also some of the emotional moments between characters).  In many ways this book called out for a good editing, a shaving of these moments to pare it down to its better writing.      Those criticisms raised, I have to say I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a weekend read, or interested in this topic.  I finished it quickly and enjoyed it very much, learning a little more about a topic I  read widely on as a teenager, but haven't revisited in many years.  The main characters are well drawn, and it pulls you in to both a personal emotional journey, and an historically based storyline.  This would be a great book for a book club, especially with its strong main narrator voice of a middle aged woman grappling with life decisions, but also in raising the issues about World War II, the importance of remembering history, and how decisions we make in our lives can have ripple effects.

0634060384|3.0|not going to talk about the content, because there are plenty of other reviews that go into great detail. i have vol 1/2, and both of the bindings are breaking with pages falling out of the back of the book. my advice is to take out the binding and holepunch all the pages and put it in a binder if you travel around with your realbook in a backpack, because it will get messed up. i don't really abuse my books either, but they do get a lot of use as i am a music student and pretty much every realbook i see at school is having the same problem.

B001CDLATE|1.0|Although \\"BARAKA is a transcendent global tour that explores the sights and sounds of the human condition like nothing you've ever seen before\\", the blu-ray disc as itself has a little problem (at least for me). It doesn't play in my equipment (Sony BDP-S300), and to make it worse, nobody could explain why. I have other blu-ray titles that play normaly. So, as a big fan of BARAKA I'll keep my digital copy until, who knows, somebody could find an answer.

B0017R5UAA|1.0|I'll confess....this was an impulse purchase at Starbuck's. There was a sticker on the cover that caught my eye. Pitchfork gave it the unheard of score 9 out of 10. Comparisons to My Morning Jacket and The Shins.    Gimme a break! I hear nothing redeeming on this disc. It's barely even music. The only similarity to My Morning Jacket is the ever-present reverb, and I don't know who thought it sounded even remotely like the great band The Shins. This is tripe! Don't be fooled by the rave reviews!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy is the best government type assasin movie series ever...The Ultimatum was a little anti climactic and slow at times, but overall the series was amazing. Identity and Supremecy were some of the best, most entertaining movies I have ever seen....Matt Damon was very believable as a hitman that worked for the government until an accident on a mission caused him to lose his memory. Even as an amnesiac, the skills learned were the only real things he could remember. A must have..Not sure of the Blu ray quality on the first two, but Ultimatum looks amazing on Blu ray
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautiful, breathtaking, nothing like I've ever seen; I'm speechless. It was so worth the money. I hope they put all the episodes on dvd.
0141317345|5.0|Charlotte's Web is a wonderful story about animal life on a farm and how animals help each other out. The characters alone are worth the read.  The story envelops the reader and there is a warmth and tenderness about the story that affects all of us, no matter what age we are.<br /><br />The point of Charlotte's Web was avoiding death, or the acting of nature upon the human (or animal).  While Charlotte did not escape the ravages of nature - Wilbur did for the length of the story.  Wilbur learned a lot about life and children through the adventures he had.  Charlotte went through an entire life cycle in the story and perpetuated her existence by having a zillion babies. (round character)  Wilbur seemed relatively stable in the story but his presence in the story drove the story as well.  (foil?)<br /><br />I hesitate to identify Wilbur as a \\"flat character\\" but maybe I am missing something.  The conflicts and actions of the story take place because of him, but he seems to be a innocent bystander and just \\"witness\\" things - not necessarily take part in them largely.<br /><br />Templeton If it was for his own interest, Templeton would  help Charlotte or Wilbur, but  \\"The rat had no morals, no conscience, no scruples, no consideration, no decency, no milk of rodent kindness, no compunction, no higher feeling, no friendliness, no anything\\" (White, 1952, p.46). I don't think he changed any.  Charlotte changed through aging, Wilbur changed through observing (and the experiences of being a special pig) but I don't think Templeton changed at all.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for children.
B001F7MSG6|3.0|Hellboy II is just an OK fantasy movie.  The first one was much better.  This time around Hellboy takes a trip through fantasy land, complete with fairies, elves, trolls and goblins.  This movie could have been called Hellboy meets the Brothers Grimm.    The humor from the original movie is still intact; the scene with Abe and Hellboy singing Barry Manilow is worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, the story is not as compelling as the first one.  I was looking forward to seeing how Kroenen would make his reappearance, but from the coming attractions viewed before Hellboy II, I see that will most likely be Hellboy 3, which makes this movie meaningless in a trilogy story line.     If Guillermo knew he would return to the Rasputin/Kroenen story line in H3, it makes you wonder why he chose to take us on this detour.  I can only hope Hellboy 3 returns to its roots, although I'm not sure how a Hellboy mini-me will fit into the story.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have seen all 3 films before on tape, laserdisc and standard DVD and I can say without a doubt that if you're a cinema fanatic like me and have a Blu-ray machine--get this you won't regret it. Enough praise has been lauded deservingly so on the first two, but I think Godfather 3 has been undeservedly bashed!!  Yes Sofia Coppola is a bad actress but she doesn't bring down this sequel either (Winona Ryder was the original choice but she caught the flu and Francis brought in his daughter to cover much to sister Talia's angst).  One plus that makes \\"3\\" still worth watching is Al Pacino's Lear like performance as the elderly Michael Corleone plus Joe Mantegna in his first major role adds menace to crime boss, Joe Zaza.  Technically speaking too, Godfather 3 is the better looking of the three so that's an offer you can't refuse!!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this movie. I am a huge sucker for musicals, and this one left a huge smile on my face............Great movie no matter what people say!!
B000063V8R|5.0|I love this series.  I pick up something \\"new\\" every time I watch an episode. Can't wait to purchase the last two years of the series (I now posess season 1-5).  Will then start to work on Voyager and Deep Space Nine.
0060254920|5.0|This story is about imagination and reality and maintaining a healthy balance between them.  The understanding that was intended to be brought from reading it is that imagination is good but remember that make-believe is make-believe and reality is reality.<br /><br />The story has remained popular with children because of it's simplicity, because of the element of adventure.  The pictures of course draw the children in.  When teaching high school English I brought my copy to school and had a student that was enjoying reading my Dr. Seuss Sneeches book, and I showed him Where the Wild Things Are (he is a senior! And 18 years old) and he had never seen the story before! I was amazed.<br /><br />What part do the pictures play in it's popularity? It is a big facet of it!  The pictures are soft, they give a humorous twist to big hairy monsters... It is appropriate for the age group it was written but also a great blast of the past for us adults. The book is adventurous and jovial. It has a happy ending. I've remembered this story all of my life. I used to have a copy of this story as a child... I purchased a copy for myself as and adult and it remains in my collection.  I remember this story because my parents read it to me - it was one of my favorites.  I think it is the artwork, the muted colors of the story and the warmth of the book that makes it a classic. The overall message of the book:  Daydreaming can be fun.  (even as adults!)
B001ED7C58|5.0|this soundtrack is terrific. i enjoy every song on it. i would recommend it to anyone no matter what kind of music you like.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this game for my family's weekly get togethers.  Everyone loves this game.  My grandchildren and adult children along with my husband and myself are addicted to this game.  I also purchased the Blokus Trigon game so more people can play at once!
B000R34V50|3.0|Better than the live action sequel movies and not a bad effort for CG.  My kids enjoy it and the picture quality is amazing.
1416575464|5.0|It gives you a great concept of how to start and maintain the same tone and manner for a room. It's a great book that it collects all the smart details from it's magazine, and combine them all together.<br /><br />This should be a X'mas gift for my friend, but now, I bought another for myself as well even tho I'm a subscriber of Dominos and I'm not moving anytime soon, but I've learn quite a lot from it!
0060922583|4.0|This book is very interesting, impressive and challenged. It gets a quite \\"simple\\" physics principle but at the same time curious (holograms). Towards his own life experiences and from respected scientific ones brings you to deep thoughts exercise about nature, world and circunstances. Really sometimes the real world looks like as being part of an illusion and in others are matter, how are these combination managed just God knows.

B0000009SF|5.0|This album comes out of my collection and onto my CD player or iPod playlist every few years, and it never disappoints.  Of the three early-70s primarily instrumental albums, \\"The Grand Wazoo\\" features the biggest band and perhaps the most relaxed sound.  Unlike other Zappa albums, this one is almost gimmick-free.  Everything you hear on it seems to have been put there purely for musical value.  The one song with lyrics, \\"For Calvin\\" does have some distorted and exaggerated vocal stylings, but as is sometimes the case with Zappa, they work beautifully here.  Elsewhere, you'll hear some fantastic guitar work from Zappa, incredible electric piano work from George Duke, lots of fabulous horns especially Sal Marquez on trumpet.  There is a merry sense of humor throughout much of this record, but there's a rare, for Zappa, lightness about it.  No rants, no Brechtian confrontations, no strained nods to Varese -- just purely original, enjoyable music.

B001GQACGO|4.0|For me, this is one of Beyonce's best CDs.  There is not a song on both disc I don't like.  The music is beautifully arranged and her vocal range is amazing.  This is a very creative effort from Ms. B.  My favorites are Halo, Disappear, Smash Into You, Satellites, Radio, Diva, Sweet Dreams, Broken-Hearted Girl and Video Phone.  The other songs are good but these are great!  Don't listen to all of the haterism.  Give this a try.
0345409671|1.0|Being a fan of the other books in the Chronicles, this was especially disappointing.  I found myself repeatedly glancing at pages ahead to see how long until the chapter ended so I could put the book down and take a break.  As I read, I kept thinking to myself \\"blah, blah, blah....\\"  You move from a gangster's ghost blathering on about his life, to Memnoch doing the same with his \\"take\\" on Creation and the Fall.  Neither character made me feel sympathetic or that either made a convincing argument in their self-justification.  I typically re-read books later on, but I'll be skipping this one when I re-visit the Vampire Chronicles.
0385340990|5.0|I never pay much too much attention to bestsellers. If anything, all the hype surrounding them just turns me off to the book. This book was a notable exception. I think it was the unusual title that first captured my attention. Reading the book description intrigued me even more. I just love a well-researched historical fiction book, and am riveted by anything that sheds light on World War II.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" was charming in its simplicity. With a few deft strokes, the authors were able to make the story of the German occupation of the Channel Islands come alive. I was initially leery of the technique of using letters alone to propel the narrative forward, but by the last satisfying page, I was left with the feeling that I had just spent a refreshing several months on Guernsey Island with Juliet, the clever protagonist of the story, immersed in a world populated by quirky, warm, and very real characters, booklovers all. A thoroughly delightful read!
B00005K424|5.0|The Quarto! travel edition board is fairly small, 7 inches to a side. While the base of the board is metal, it is trimmed in a cherry stained wood. The pieces are magnetized, in normal \\"travel\\" fashion. They're of a nice wooden nature, however, and pretty enough.<br /><br />On the game board there is a 4×4 grid of circles surrounded by a larger circle, which in turn is inside of the square of the game board. While the base of the board is metal, it is trimmed in a cherry stained wood.<br /><br />The object of the game is to be the person who completes a line of 4 pieces, each sharing a common aspect. There are 4 aspects in the game that the pieces may share: height, shape, solidity, and color. The person who makes that line calls out \\"Quarto!\\" and notes the line that he made and the aspect that they share. He's the winner.<br /><br />There are 16 pieces in this game, each unique. There are:<br /><br />* 8 circular pieces and 8 square pieces<br />* 8 dark pieces and 8 light pieces<br />* 8 hollow pieces and 8 solid pieces<br />* 8 tall pieces and 8 short pieces<br /><br />So, for example, one of the pieces is a tall dark hollow round piece. Another is a tall dark hollow short piece.<br /><br />To start, the first player selects one of the 16 pieces and gives it to his opponent to place. After placing that piece, the other player selects one of the remaining pieces and gives it to his opponent. In this way, the game proceeds until someone has created a line of 4 pieces sharing the same aspect (say, 4 dark pieces or 4 square pieces).<br /><br />The game is simple. It's ingenious, really. It goes quickly at first, because you're not running into any possibilities that you might have 4 in a row that share the same aspect. But before too long, 3 in a row with the same aspect start popping up.<br /><br />Should you leave them there, or close them up so they can't be used? I guess it all depends on what's left out there, and the rest of the board. If you leave them there, it gives your opponent a chance to fill it in. But it also gives you a chance to fill it in. So if you can figure out a way to confound your opponent into giving you what you want, you're in good shape.<br /><br />You'll look down at the pieces on the board and be like \\"Hmmm, I can't give him a square piece, because there's a line of 3 square pieces. And there's also a line of 3 hollow pieces, so I can't give him that either. So I need to find a piece that's solid and round.\\" So you look at the remaining pieces and discount all of the hollow and square pieces, choosing one and giving it to him. He can then either \\"close out\\" one of those lines, hence freeing that aspect so he can give it to you (if he's been painted into a corner), or try and ride it out and force you to give him the piece he desires.<br /><br />When you first start to play there'll be a lot of Homerish \\"D'oh!\\"s. A lot of forehead slapping fun. But then you'll start to see how the game is played, and try to maneuver so that your opponent has limited choices as to what to give you. And then your placements will reflect that as well.<br /><br />The game is tactically rich, and opportunistic. It plays very quickly, provided the players don't suffer too bad from AP. Piece selection is very careless in the beginning, when it doesn't matter. But thereafter it's just as important, if not more important, than where you actually place the piece.<br /><br />Quarto is an excellent game, and the travel edition fits the bill perfectly. This is an outstanding game to play if you're waiting for your meals to arrive at a restaurant, for example. The board is small, it plays quickly, and it's easy to set up and break down.

0956010903|5.0|This is an amazing artifact pulled straight out of the Harry Potter world. It is, for the whole hearted Harry Potter fan, an amazing object to own, to hold. The quality is very good, and I'll probably be uploading pictures soon.     Due to some of the more...negative reviews I have seen, I am actually quite surprised at them, when this book was enjoyable to read as it was to hold. The outer cover encasing the actual book is not, as I read, an obvious \\"Piece of Plastic\\" but it is fake leather with, of course, a similar look and feel to true leather, which I liked.      Open the cover, and you see a red velvet bag, in which the actual book is enclosed in. On the opposite side of the cover, there is a pouch containing 10 prints of the J.K. Rowling story illustrations that are in the book. I was also humored when I recalled another review saying the quality was poor of J. K. Rowling's drawings. They looked like something you would see in the pages of a coloring book, or comic book. I saw nothing wrong with them, what was expected? Not to mention the fact that the book is styled to have the look and feel of a medieval item.     I'll post some pictures soon.     Very wonderful book, very high quality. I certainly got what I paid for. Not to mention I donated to charity, which is the biggest plus. :)  P.S- I read someone's book had emerald stones? Mine were more like aquamarine. So I am also guessing there are different colors for almost every book? If so, even better!
0805053883|4.0|The entire series is a must, but \\"From Head to Toe\\" is the most engaging. This book gets you and your little one to make sounds and noises, which is fun for toddlers. Really make the investment and get: Brown Bear, Baby Bear, Panda Bear, and From Head to Toe.
0061544493|5.0|I love this book! It's very easy to read and contains a lot of pictures of Victoria, of clothes and some drawing. I also love the list of \\"where to buy\\"...there's a lot of information for those who care about fashion. and as for me, i love having useful books that also look gorgeous, it's so nice to hold this kind of book in your hands. it is worth to buy i think.
159448385X|5.0|Easy reading of very deep profound book that describes the story of two Afghan women that come from different backgrounds, but cannot escape from the cultural influences of their country. I was hesitant to read this book, after watching the movie based on Hosseini's book \\"Kite Runner\\", friendship exposed with  caring and cruel events lived by two little boys. In this book, Khaled Hosseini has succeeded in capturing many important historical and contemporary themes, in a way that your heart will be touched over and over again.<br /><br />I could not drop this book. It captured me... I couldn't wait to know what had happened to Miriam and Laila.  This story deals with issues of class, religion, sexual roles, child rearing, work, education, and community...and how male control the \\"system\\".  I would definetely recommend it.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|Casino Royale, 2006 film     It starts in Prague in the Czech Republic. A man goes to his office and finds another man there. They talk, one gets a surprise. [This is in monochrome.] There is an animated introduction. Then the scene shifts to Mbale in Uganda. A military leader talks to a man in a suit. A suitcase filled with US$100 notes! A cell phone allows a call to a broker. The scene shifts to Madagascar. There is betting about a cobra and a mongoose. One of the viewers gets a message on his cell phone then takes off running! He is pursued to a construction project by James Bond. [Those stunts seem unbelievable but the chase provides action to hold your interest.] There is shooting with automatic rifles. Has Bond failed? No, there is another surprise so the hero gets away. [I wonder if the ending will be as exciting?]     Two men play cards. One looks at the TV news. The scene changes to the House of Parliament in London. The calls on a cell phone are traced to Paradise Island. M criticizes Bond's actions (because they were photographed and documented). Bond is in deep trouble now. The scene changes to Nassau in the Bahamas. [Noted for money laundering?] Bond notices the surveillance cameras, then parks a Range Rover. [Notice the understated uniforms of hotel security.] Bond selects a recording of past events. He learns the name of the owner of an Aston-Martin. [Another product placement?] A young woman rides a white horse on the beach. Bond's actions are reported to M. Bonds plays cards and wins big! He asks a married woman about her husband. Bond leaves for Miami to follow a man. He avoids danger! A cell phone identifies a man, Bond follows him. Will there be confusion from a sprinkler system? Is there a plan to create an explosion? There are collisions to create action. [This does not replace a good story.]     The police shoot out the tires on a truck. The fight inside continues. Bond steps out to be greeted by the Miami police. The villain sets off the bomb. Le Chiffre watches the news. \\"Someone talked.\\" What's the body count? Dimitrios was only a middleman, he arranged deals. Shorting a stock led to a great loss for Le Chiffre. Bond will play cards with Le Chiffre. This gambling casino is in Montenegro. Her Majesty's Treasury will back Bond with ten million, or more. Bond shows his ability in reading a stranger. [This talk pads out the movie.] Vesper Lynd accompanies Bond. We see the old city and learn what Photoshop can do to targets [This replaces forged typewritten documents]. The card game begins. Le Chiffre bets 50 thousand, then more; he wins! Then its time for a break. Le Chiffre has visitors. There is a spurt of action to shock the viewers!     Bond tidies up his mess, then returns to the table. When he returns Vesper is frightened. Bond's work product was placed in a car trunk for someone to find! Then the game continues. Is someone bluffing? Le Chiffre bets all and wins. Was Bond arrogant? [Did Le Chiffre read Bond and act like he was bluffing?] Will Felix Leiter help Bond? Can someone tamper with a drink? Bond gets instructions to counteract digitalis poisoning! Vesper saves his life and Bond returns to the game. The stakes are ver high. Bond wins! \\"Congratulations.\\" There is more action as Vesper is abducted and Bond races after her! There is another surprise! Bond is captured, stripped, and threatened to get the password. What can save Bond now? What can save Bond now? [Watch and see.] There is a happy ending. A banker visits to effect a money transfer. Vesper and Bond get to know each other better. They are in Venice now. Will there be a problem? Yes. Will there be more shooting and destruction? There is a tragic ending. We hear the solution to the probleml What will James Bond do next?     This movie runs on too long, there is too much action and not enough of a story. Can they do better next time? The fault in this story is to have Bond as a victim who is saved by luck.
B00006IU73|5.0|This is one of the most creative, entertaining CDs I've heard since the 60's. At times it reminds me of Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Crosby Stills and Nash, and Joe Satriani. I can't stop listening to this CD. It's been a long time since I was stuck playing just one. If you like progressive rock the first 6 and last song are essential songs in your collection.
B00000IMYA|3.0|I would have been satisfied with the live content, as indicated by the title, on a single disc. Two discs with studio recordings duplicating the same titles and adding others was irritating and detracted from the ambience. I transferred the real stuff to a single separate disc for satisfactory listening.
0452286751|1.0|Ok, to start off lets forget all about the B.S Philosophy of Ayn Rand and focus purely on the writing content of the story itself.    I give it one star, simply for the character development which seems to follow her philosophy fairly well. She seems to have developed the Protagonist and the antagonist very well, though it seems she did this by accident if only to fill her philosophical ideals. It's apparent because the supporting characters seem shallow and their interactions in no way resemble true human relationships.    Rand seems like she tries to make up for this with excruciating and painfully dull, redundant, and useless detail such as the one sentence that almost made me burn the damn thing. \\"They went on, to move, to feel the movement, to know the feeling of their own muscles moving\\"    If rand wanted to create a nice piece of literature and not just a semi creative philosophy book, she could have cut out the redundant details and focused more on tying in all the complex details and philosophy of the book itself with a viable and decent story line. If you cut out all the useless B.S the book itself would be about 1/3 shorter and easier to read.    This book is a good example of why many famous philosophers such as Aristotle and Cicero stuck to the non-fiction genre. Philosophy alone doesn't make a good story.
0545128285|2.0|I was really excited to be able to get another book from the world of Harry Potter. But now that I have it and read it, it was a waste of my time, money and excitement. This book might be ok for the very youngest of readers, but anyone older than 8 or 9... spend your money elsewhere.    Sorry, J.K. Rowling - I can't believe I've given one of your books a bad review. There are so many things that could be done as follow ups to the HP books, this shouldn't have been one of them.

B000002UB3|5.0|Unquestionably one of the Beatles finest releases.  Superb production, a great mix of soulful and playful music and lyrics - absolutely timeless.  A great show of the transition from the 'She Loves You' days of innocence to the psychedelic outpourings that came to exemplify the late Beatles and really introduce the world to a new genre of music. Everyone should own this album.
B0010ZR160|1.0|First off, if you expect the main protagonist to have any depth whatsoever, please disabuse yourself of this misapprehension before beginning the movie.  Casey Afflect cannot act, sorry to say.  He mumbles rather than speaks, has only one expression (a slightly bored, slightly cynical, mostly \\"what the heck am I supposed to do now?\\"), is way too young for the part, and never, never convincingly shows his motivations or character.  Why would anyone be afraid of him, and why would anyone ever confide in him?  And how does he seem to know, from school (!??!!!) almost every non-policeman in the movie?     The protagonist's girlfried is a cypher who seems to hang around her boyfriend for no discernable reason, doesn't seem to help him, and, like her man, has only one expression.    On the plus side, Ed Harris is good.     To the movie itself, it is a collection of scenes, not a coherent whole.  What motivates the characters is either unsaid, and therefore unguessable, or presented at a sophomoric level.  No subtlety at all.    Maybe in trying to film the book the screenwriters wanted to include specific scenes and then tried to tie them together.  Since the actors were bad, we can't determine why things happened through either their personalities or actions, but have to depend on the writing.  Unfortunately, too much must have been lost in going from book to screen.    In short, a mess.    Avoid.
159448385X|4.0|A history of the lives of 2 women in Afghanistan, also history of the strife in that country in the last 50 years.  This book will keep you turning pages, thats for sure. It will also make the readers  realize how very lucky we are to live in a wonderful country like the USA. Most of us haxe always felt that way, but this book reaffirms it.
068485743X|5.0|After writing three novels and beginning another, I stumbled upon this book. I wasn't into it more than two chapters before I wanted to bang my head on my laptop keyboard. I had no idea that publishers were so eager to throw out new authors! This book is well written, moves from one topic to another quickly, while giving great examples of terrible text churned out by bumbling amateurs. God help me if my 7th attempt at re-writing my second novel falls into that category.
B0000942LT|5.0|The band's fourth album sounds mildly different from \\"Break the Cycle\\", and drastically different from \\"Dysfunction.\\" There are no depressing melodies or hard-hitting lyrics that are found in \\"Dysfunction\\" and sometimes in \\"Cycle\\", but we do get to see a major maturity from Staind. It may be bad to some fans, but I still admire this band even with the change in sound. 14 Shades of Grey contains the singles \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"Price to Play,\\" and \\"Zoe Jane\\". All three songs are great to listen to, and the other songs on the album, particulary \\"Fray\\", should not be missed.<br /><br />Grade: A
B000002L9W|3.0|This is a good album by Van Halen's original and current frontman, but to say its as good as anything Van Halen did with Sammy Hagar is absurd.  If it was DLR would not have ended up playing in Vegas wheras Van Hagar hit #1 with all 4 of their albums and were the Monsters Of Rock!    DLR hires a junior Van Halen here and went after the Classic Van Halen audience while Van Halen moved on musically and made new fans while keeping a bunch of old ones too.    This was Daves best solo album but if you want some DLR, grab one of the first 6 Van Halen albums.

6305810109|4.0|I purchased The Straight Story VHS tape and am very satisfied. Have always liked the film and was glad to find the VHS tape for sale.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|The feature film of the popular series fully lives up to our expectations of the aged but cherished Cindarella story.
0061251305|5.0|This book was so useful! What a different way of looking at how people work and communicate.
1592402690|4.0|A very vivid and evocative book.  I really got a great feel of that era in Britain as well as what it was like to walk the halls of EMI (Abby Road) studios. Although the book contains thougthtful descriptions of his very innovative recording techniques (enough to satisfy me as a recording engineer) they never take over the story, and in fact are presented in a way that would be equally interesting to musicians and non musicians alike.  The story is always focused on the personalities and really puts the reader into that era.
B000068TPN|5.0|Excellent movie which shows the compassion and guts it takes to be a soldier as well as a father, husband or son.
0060245867|5.0|This in my opinion is up there with Goodnight Moon and The Hungry Caterpillar...my son loves this book. We actually had to buy this a couple times, because the first copy was paperback, bad decision for a toddler, then we bought a used hardback copy on here, and it has held up great!
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|You can't beat this DVD. All four Lethal Weapons movies for a few bucks and you know you are guaranteed to watch them more than once. Gibson and Glover have some real chemistry going right from the start and there is a strong supporting cast - although I'd had more than enough of our idiotic friend Leo, shouting around the place for no good reason, by the last movie.    As the franchise develops, the story lines get a bit weaker and the comedy aspect is played up. So Lethal Weapon 4 has lost the pathos of the first movie completely. No matter, it's a great watch with some spectacular baddies and some great martial arts. The sinister South Africans are my favorite criminals in the series.     Buying this set, which comes on two, two-sided DVDs, is a no-brainer. Enjoy.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|my only problem with this film which is otherwise really quite good and complex on a number of levels is the odd bit with the supernatural sea hag creature.  Otherwise it's the classic idea that trolls were actually neaderthals which is also the theme in eaters of the dead by michael crichton and the movie The 13th warrior based on the book.  Beowulf's close friend is actually one of the same actors from the 13th warrior interestingly enough.  The sea hag bit really ruined an otherwise great movie.
B000002LUB|5.0|This CD is again very good like others Black Sabbath Dio's era.  It was an excellent purchase!
B001BKZDB4|5.0|Great product,as promise,but most important was the shippment,i couldnt believe how fast it was,A+...i will definately keep  doing business with you guys...thanks my daughter loved the movie...
B00005N6KG|3.0|i can't seem to NOT buy these...mainly because they fit snuggly and comfortably in your ear while working out, they NEVER fall out or require ajustment...the PROBLEM is that they work for about 4-6 months, depending upon how heavily you use them, before one of the earpieces goes out...its happened on EVERY pair i've owned, so many i can't count...fortunately they are cheap...so just buy 2 pairs so you don't get annoyed when they do, because they WILL....i wish Sony would work on that problem, i would even pay MORE for them if they would just last a YEAR!
0671449028|5.0|My grandchildren love this book and Mom or Dan have to read it every night.  They love the pictures and still ask questions of Mom or Dad.  Will order more of Sandra's silly books in future.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Yes, we've heard all the hype before. But once in a while, an album comes along and just grabs you by the throat and will not let go until you finally pick up a copy. Then that copy becaome part of the rotation in your music libary, never being put away.   This CD happens to be one of them.    Now before I get into the review, I am a Machine Head fan, and I do have all of their albums, from the well done \\"Burn My Eyes\\" to the awful \\"Supercharger\\". I am pretty biased about their music, so no matter how bad (Or how good) an album they make, I'm gonna listen to it and make my own judgement.   But this CD brought me back to why I love their music in the first place.   Right from the opening track \\"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent\\", This CD sucked me in a roller coaster of brutal, loud, yet well written and melodic sound, drawing out an emotion from me that hard to describe. The closest I can describe is like going to your favorite band's concert for the first time.   I got sucked in by tracks like \\"Beautiful Morning\\", \\"Aesthetics Of Hate\\", \\"Slanderous\\", even \\"Now I lay Thee Down\\" and I'm not too big on songs similar to that track. I found myself moshing at my job while listening to the entire album.   The mixing is perfectly done, Rob Flynn really shines in this CD, but it's just not him. Phil Demmel, Adam Duce, and Dave McClain also throw their weight into the songs, blending together as a whole, but yet standing out individually. You don't hear that very often. The last time I heard that was on Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\", Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\", and the late Chuck Schuldiner's band \\"Control Denied\\".   Granted, the album is rather long, but so was Metallica's \\"And Justice For All\\". A couple of the tracks are over 10 minutes long, and the Album itself is about or a little over 65 minutes long, making it seem like an \\"Epic\\" type of album.   You get an idea of what each track is about by listening yourself, especially \\"A Farewell To Arms\\", and the forementionedtracks, \\"Aestheics Of Hate\\", \\"Slanderous\\", and of course a personal favorite, \\"Wolves\\".    Very few Metal Albums deserve the praise it gets, this deserves more. You know this is something good when it beats out a few Post-Hardcore bands for \\"Album of the year\\" on Metal Hammer magazine.   Recently, Machine re-released The blackening with two bonus tracks \\"Battery\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", a couple of covers  from Metallica and Iron Maiden. Nice choices if you ask me. Those two covers alone make this CD much more enjoyable.   But this CD itself is worth buying. I highly recommend it.
B0019KWE6S|5.0|If you like Perry Blake and David Sylvian (of course) or even late Talk Talk (or Mark Hollis solo), you will love this album. Slow, melancholic, at times even sad, but most of all beautiful. Not lovely, not sweet - pure, raw beauty like raw diamond - you need to make an effort to get inside it to discover all the hidden treasure. But it's worth trying. Samadhisound seems to evolve into must-have label.
B0017MO10U|5.0|It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. The seller was fast, the package was secured, and more important, I was happy when I got it. Once it arrived, I took it out of the package and popped it in the DVD player. When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go. I am now starting my collection of the series since there are a lot of episodes I've never gotten to see. For me, I like watching the behind the scenes portion. I write screenplays myself and so I learn a lot from the director's and actor's point of view. If you're not into that stuff, it's still a kick to watch! I can even deal with the historical babble that Daniel rattles off. Enjoy the ride!
B001ED7C58|4.0|There is a good variety of songs on the soundtrack.  They are very original, which I like.  I listen to the soundtrack all the time!
B001ER4CNY|5.0|This comes in the cutest container that looks like genie's bottle! it's like a decoration as well as the dvd's
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This movie is my kid's favorites.  My wife and I enjoy the story and audio production.  The opening scene is one of the best tests for a theater system.  Even though it is a cartoon, it sounds like you're running around the track with the cars.  When I want to demonstrate my surround sound system to my friends I do not feel ashamed to pop in a kid's movie.  The audio was put together great care and it shows.
0956010903|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this purchase. $100 is a lot to spend on any book, so my expectations were fairly high for this book. I could purchase the standard edition for $7.14, so I could have my own copies of the stories for much cheaper. This only made my expectations much greater.<br /><br />The large case that this comes with is quite impressive. Obviously some good detail work, nice leathery-feel to it, and just an nice case. The downside is that it's quite large, much larger than necessary. The \\"extra\\" prints of JK Rowling's sketches are not particularly awe-inspiring. It's nice to have them, but JKR is no great artist.<br /><br />The book itself is not what I really expected. The exterior is quite nice, although I did find the corner embellishments to be a bit too far away from the sides. What was most disappointing was that there are multiple typographical errors in the book. I found this completely unacceptable. For something so expensive of such great importance ($100!), I demand perfection. I also found the font fairly annoying, but livable.<br /><br />If what we paid for were superior packaging, closeness to the original book sold at auction, and JKR's poorly enlarged drawing then I feel cheated. I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, so I'll keep what I purchased, but I feel quite let down by Amazon. The velvet slipcase with JKR's embroidered signature might be the one redeeming point of this purchase.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I love the CD. To me the music makes Taylor Swift sound so much more Muture sounding and more gown up im her voice I love every one of her songs. She is a very good song writter and singer.
B000HL0KFW|3.0|I was very excited to show this to my husband since he is just liked MacGyver but had never seen an episode.  Unfortunately it didn't work too well.  I don't know if our computer was too slow, or if it was our internet connection, but it won't play for more than two seconds without a pause, making it a very choppy viewing experience.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|I was a semi- fan of AC/DC for years, but the only lp I had of theirs was \\"Back In Black.\\"<br />  I heard that this lp was dropping and I was very intrigued...so I bought it.<br />  Damn, I am so glad I did!  This mutha jams.<br />  From the first cut, \\"Rock and Roll Train\\", to \\"War Machine\\", to the serene (?) \\"Wheels\\"...I was very impressed by the vocals and the screaming guitar work.<br />  Vintage Ac/DC.<br />If you are a fan of hard rock, this album belongs in your collection.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an outstanding video and I would highly recommend it as a part of any family's collection.  It is especially educational for all school-age students but our family adults who have seen it also learned a lot.    The photography is spectacular and we also find it to be perfect on our television with the sound turned down so that our friends and family members can catch some of the views during a casual conversational visit.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is an extremely funny and sardonic movie -- among other things the US intro to Simon Pegg -- but it was listed on the \\"Gifts Ideas for Women\\" as a chick flick!  My wife and her friends hate this film: we will reserve an analysis of their odd filmic tastes for another post.  However I only assume the zombie gift-people at Amazon were extending the snarky nature of this excellent film by offering it up alongside \\"Becoming Jane\\" and \\"My Fair Lady\\".  There indeed are women in Shaun of the Dead, although most have hollow eyes, are visibly rotting and are ceaselessly hungry for human flesh.  Madonna aside -- you can draw your own conclusions here -- I don't get it as a choice for that \\"special someone\\".
B00007GZR5|5.0|I put this in my top three movies of all time. A story of true love and commitment. Robin Williams shows he can be in serious movies as well.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|This is a variation on the theme of Beethoven's life. It adds a woman where none existed in his later years, but she is so pretty and likable that we don't care about authenticity. Buy this is film with a heavy discount and you won't be disappointed. Ed Harris is enjoying his role and so should you. And, oh yes, the music is good too.
0688101364|5.0|I already knew this was a great cookbook as I had it previously and used it so much that it fell apart and needed to replace it.  All of the recipes are error proof.  The shipper was great, the book arrived within a couple of days of ordering it and was in great shape.  Thanks.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This album should win a grammy. It's a wonder they still have the balls to even attempt something this big. And pull it off so well. Halford is still THE MAN. Thanks guys for a great cd!
B001DSNG36|5.0|[[ASIN:B001DSNG36 Absolutely Live]]    WOW! If you have a desire to see George Benson in concert, but never had the opportunity, this is the DVD. His performace is Absolutely Live; you feel as though you are there, front row, center stage. Joe Sample's presence only enhances this production.I received this DVD as a gift and misplaced it when I moved.  I searched the local retailers, however to no avail and decided to try Amazon.com, what more can I say?      If you purchase this DVD, you will enjoy it over and over and over again!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Leave it to Alan Ball to put a new kind of spin on an old theme.  The Six Feet Under creator and American beauty writer adapted Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Series of Sookie Stackhouse novels with spectacular results with True Blood; which presents to us a world in which vampires not only exist, but are public knowledge.  Since I've never read any of the novels, I can't vouch for how faithful True Blood is to the source material, but what I can say is that Ball and co. have crafted a believable take on a tired theme.  Anna Paquin (X-Men, The Piano) plays Sookie: a Louisiana barmaid who just so happens to be able to read people's minds, a trick which both comes in handy and gives her a good share of headaches to boot.  Soon enough, her interest is piqued in Bill (Stephen Moyer), a 137 year old vampire with whom sparks start flying, much to the dismay of her dim-witted sex-addict brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), her best friend Tara (Rutina Wesley), and her boss Sam (Sam Trammell) who has a few secrets of his own.  Oh yeah, there's also a serial killer running rampant targeting girls who have been with vamps, and soon enough has Sookie targeted as well.  With plenty of twists, turns, standout performances, and an undeniably sexy atmosphere to boot; True Blood makes for one of HBO's most addicting shows in quite some time.  Vets from other HBO shows are abound as well, including William Sanderson (Deadwood) and Chris Bauer (The Wire) as two investigating cops, as well as Lois Smoith as Sookie and Jason's nurturing grandmother.  All in all, even if you aren't a fan of vampire lore, give True Blood a chance, and you'll be quite surprised by what you find here.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Been a long time fan and have every album. While I think the last album \\"All the Right Reasons\\" is still their best, \\"Dark Horse\\" was another fine edition to my collection.
0307455874|5.0|Extremely inspiring- the man who is our next President has really been through a lot and seen a lot. He writes with wisdom and honesty about his life and the experience of someone who never, ever fit in and yet somehow found his way.  It is a great read and a book I will never forget.
0545128285|1.0|Being a big Harrry Potter fan I bought this book to introduce the author to my granddaughter. I should have known better.  Any creative work specially commissioned or done for charity tends to be third rate, and this is no exception unfortunately.  The book is bland, preachy, and boring. I read the first story and thought, well, I'll just give it to the thrift shop.  I read the second story and thought, no, I'll just put it in the trash.  If J.K. Rowling wants to fund her charity, she should do the ethical thing and just write them a check.
0765316897|5.0|In Brandon Sanderson's trilogy ender, THoA, he succeeds in creating a nail biter to the final page.  Fast paced, and all questions answered this is how fanatasy books should be written!  I am eagerly anticipating the next fantasy novel Brandon releases!  This book convinced me that I will enjoy A Memory of Light, book 12 of the Wheel Of Time series.  All Robert Jordan fans,as well as fantasy fans, should pick up this trilogy, they will be entertained!
0743201140|5.0|I was surprised at my strengths.  But after reading the book, I was awakened to what my strengths are.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I purchased Season Three to complete my adult daughter's collection of all the seasons of The Gilmore Girls.  I have been watching it myself;  I never watched it when it was on TV.  It is wonderful!  It is filled with quirky characters and a dialogue that is fast, sometimes funny and full of cultural references.  I recommend starting with Season One and working your way through all the seasons.
0307383415|5.0|This book is thoughtful and insightful.  It is so deep that at one point, when he takes a woman out to the theater, the exchange that takes place when he takes her home, in that moment, he became for me, a real life \\"Mr. Darcy\\".
0670020745|5.0|this is a short easy read and really shows some insite into brain injury and how the right side left side work together.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the third set of Planet Earth I have bought as gifts. It is one of the best Television series I have ever seen. I don't get excited much about what's on television but this is the best entertainment for the whole family. Just love the whole series.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|these 20 songs on this collection are a great sampler for the new or casual fan only looking to pick up their best songs and in that use its perfect.     for bigger fans i'd reccomend the anthology
B00003CXPD|5.0|I purchased this video as a gift for a dear friend.  We both love the story and found it transfers well to any country, age, gender.  I sincerely recommend it .  Billy Elliott received it's highest compliment when Sir Elton John saw it and proceeded to create Billy Elliott the musical on Broadway!  He related his life with his father to the story.  Enjoy it!
0140277447|5.0|This is one of those oh-my-god books. I was shocked to find out at the time that I read this book, that the Japanese had been following the Nazi handbook. I don't know if it was the Nazis or the Japanese who first thought up these extermination and human experimentation techniques. They also seem to have been into the Super Race Syndrome. The Imperial Japanese Navy took on a new meaning for me. That the Japanese had treated the Chinese people in this manner is mind boggling. It does seem that as the Jew was to the Nazis so was the Chinese to the Japanese. The author of this book even documented this horrible Rape and other atrocities with pictures - pictures taken by the Japanese soldiers to send home or keep as mementoes of their stay. This is a real-life horror story. It is a difficult book to read. I put it down several times just because I could not take any more of the horrible details. Sometimes I would let it sit idle for weeks before picking it up again. I had to force myself to continue to read it. But I wanted to finish, because these are the things about mankind and war that we can not afford to ever forget!<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />Mein Kampf - An Analysis od Book One
6305657947|1.0|What a waste of a story line! This bomb only needs to be watched to see how the original got it right!
B000QGEB12|5.0|Buy this film...  If you like Kung fu flicks and comedies, you're going to like this one.
0451149513|5.0|awesome book
B001F7MSFW|2.0|What can I say ,the first Hellboy - Graphic Novel.  The second Hellboy - MIB (men in black).  Guess I assumed del torro could actually pull a sequel off on this otherwise great character...
B000002A46|5.0|This is a great mix of classic and new Christmas songs. A must have for any Christmas collection.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon proves to the world once again what keeps him on top: his innovative ideas combined with his wit and knack for creating dialogue. Great performances turned in by the leads (Harris, Day & Fillion); look forward to the proposed sequel.<br /><br />Edit: I honestly must have been ill to leave such a short (if enthusiastic) review. Dr. Horrible is so much more than that. In a relatively short timespan - I believe the entire thing is around 47 minutes - Our three main characters draw us into a different world, and flesh it and themselves out enough to empathize with the villain, root for the heroine, and loathe the previously adored Nathan Fillion (Mal Reynolds FTW). It was brilliantly cast. I had no idea that NPH was on Broadway but apparently the man can do anything, and Day and Fillion turned in surprisingly strong performances despite little or no background in musicals.<br /><br />Beyond that, I have to give Whedon and crew some serious props. The soundtrack is surprisingly addictive and worth the buy. Granted, not all of the tracks are stand out, but there are at least three that make you do a double take and hit the repeat button at least once or twice. The music is fairly simple, but carried out in a masterful manner, and the lyrics are rich and compelling within the context of the drama.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a buy, and the soundtrack, too. Now if that sequel could just happen......
B000LPS4BG|2.0|One of Martin Scorsese's best films. There is a flaw on the disc itself. There is a line running down the screen on chapter 27. The Robert DeNiro scene with Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Same problem on two discs. This may be a transfer process issue. Great movie, bad BD copies.
B000W74EQC|5.0|This is a great movie! It is just like all the other great Harry Potter movies. Widescreen is a great choice.
1573226521|4.0|Saw the movie first and then read the book.  Director of the film took the blame for lackluster box office success.  Not the case I believe.  Book took the long way around in moving the plot along. Number of times left you hanging and moved in another direction from there. Film held the story together well in cause and effect.  Back story was quick and conflict was progressive.  Cinematography was great; makes you want to go to Thailand.  If you do - stay with the tour - always. Read the book first, watch the film and book your flight and tour.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This DVD is very well done.  The video was not the best on 1080P but is still very well done on Blu Ray.  Need more Pink Floyd Blu Ray.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I saw this movie at the drive-in theatre and it was sensational- then I viewed it at home on my plasma TV on blu-ray and it was even better....included in the box were 4 pair of 3-D glasses.  This was an excellent addition to my movie collection - and a party pleaser.  FUN!
B001CW7ZXA|1.0|Impossible to play due to different system for reproduction. No previous information warning about reproduction system.  A real pitty.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The movie arrived a day before the release date in the stores. That was great because it was a birthday gift which was the same as the release date. Very satisfied with the service. I even received a $2 credit because there was a price adjustment to the pre order rate. Loved that![[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I have seen this movie 5 times now and I just can't say enough good things about it.  I do not normally watch animated stuff and first watched WALL-E on an airline flight to Asia because I was running out of things to watch.  I was really surprised at how entertaining it was.  WALL-E is a hard working little trash compactor who finds love and follows it across the galaxy.    Enjoy, I did!
0739366416|5.0|An awesome book filled with hope. The country needs it, and change. Author reads the book. He shows great honesty.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have owned this series in VHS format for many years. I enjoy these three films so much that I had to have it in Blu-ray. I guess that says it all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this video.  I use it to get a good, quick workout when I can't get to the gym or I don't feel like leaving home.  It's constant movement for 20 minutes, then you're finished.  It's great, and I would definitely suggest it for anyone who is intimidated by going to the gym.  The movements are easy, and you will immediately break a sweat.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie.  We love Tim Burton and his crooked mind so much.  The visuals are fantastic.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I have a new favorite artist and his name is David Cook. This album is breath-taking. I was especially impressed by the fact that he wrote most of the songs on this album. My pesonal favorites are Avalance, Come Back to Me, Lie and Declaration. I'm certain that we will being seeing David Cook in the music scene for a long time to come. I'm so glad that this wonderfully talented man was discovered. I can't wait to hear more from him in the future. I'm definately a fan.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|So far the only other 'character' my grandson has really gotten into is 'Pingu', he loves Pingu. However, now Pingu has a rival in 'Kung Fu Panda'. This little guy is 22 months old and wasn't feeling well so I thought we would just sit instead of play his favoite game 'Memaw Run!' :)  I put this movie on, not really thinking he would ever sit through an entire movie. I really didn't think we'd be actually sitting on the couch watching it for very long. However, he was just so 'into' the movie, that in the middle of it he actually got up and did a couple of little 'kung fu' kicks of his own, some spinning around along with the panda, and then continued to watch it.  After nap time I really had no plan to have the TV on again, but here he was asking for Panda again.<br />Ok I guess that was sort of a review from the almost 2 year old point of view. So now I will tell you that I enjoyed it also. I found no parts boring, thought the whole thing was great. Loved the voices that were chosen for each character, loved the art, very vivid colors and most importantly for watching with very small children, it is not TOO long, about an hour and a half. No doubt this is one DVD that will be watched several times at our house.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This was a gift for my little 3 and 4 yr old nieces.  They enjoyed it very much and the younger wanted to know what was wrong with her face.  Stimulating and different fromt he other movies they see.  Thank you for the quick service.
B001HXG8PK|4.0|I knew this was coming out. They even said so on their website for the soundtrack, but the music was just so good that I had to pick up the initial release knowing full well I would double-dip when this set came out.    I enjoy all the extra tracks, but like the other reviewers have stated, I was bothered by them just being thrown upon the disc rather than being placed in order. It would have been great and made the set worthy of 5 stars had they just taken the time to do that: rework the first disc and place all the tracks in order. It's not like they didn't have the time. They stated they were going to release this before the movie even came out.    It's not a deal-breaker, but it does drop the set to 4 stars. I know a lot of soundtracks have the score out of sequence, but not usually when the entire score is released. I felt a bit cheated with the fact that disc 1 of this set was just a straight dupe from the original release. If they had taken the time to re-arrange this it would have been a no-brainer purchase.    I was also a touch disappointed with the 40 page booklet that accompanies the set. It really has no redeaming value. The whole book is just photos (nice photos to be sure) from the movie and credits with a 1 page commentary from director Christopher Nolan which was also on the original release. I would have loved it had they added a page or two from each composer on their thoughts regarding the development of this score, but alas, nothing like that appears.    Finally, the rubber stoppers that are supposed to hold the disc in place in the book are horrendous. Too fat. When you put the disc back in after straining to get it out the first time the rubber flakes off a bit and you need to really work at it to get the disc to sit properly.     5 stars easy for the music, but 3 stars for the packaging and for not arranging the music in order makes it overall 4 stars for me.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|Quality was quite good, 3D not as good as the theatre experience but very good for the home. Recommended, but check out the original if you've never seen it.
B001HN6972|4.0|The Reader is off to a brilliant start with convincing characters, superb acting and looming tragedy, but seems to lose its sure footing as it heads toward a conclusion that feels partly carelessly planned and mainly lacking direction. It decreases the most potent revelations and resides on a powerful love that was successfully sustained only during the beginning. Once again the order of events are jumbled on the timeline and an unexpectedly long ending detracts from the impact of the most poignant moments, not least of which is an undying love story that overshadows the historical importance of the war crime trials that set up a heartbreaking reunion.<br /><br />In 1958 West Germany 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) is escorted home by a mysterious woman after becoming ill. Diagnosed with scarlet fever and bedridden for three months, he eventually seeks out Hanna (Kate Winslet) to thank her for her aid. Soon the two begin an unlikely (and very graphic) affair that lasts the duration of the summer - Hanna is distant and uncompassionate, but Michael finds himself hopelessly in love (he insists on knowing her name by the third day they are together). Before each sexual tryst Michael reads to Hanna - starting with his school assignments; a German play, Homer's Odyssey, Huckleberry Finn, The Lady with the Little Dog and eventually he even reads comic strips.<br /><br />One day Hanna vanishes, and Michael is left to return to school, study law, and carry on relationships with people his own age. In 1966, while attending a trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners, he spies Hanna as one of the defendants, who had become involved with the SS shortly after ending their affair. Years later, torn between remembering the great flame they shared and condemning her for her crimes, Michael is haunted by the trial and determined to sort out his feelings of guilt and love.<br /><br />It's certainly a unique angle to show a sympathetic lead character toward Holocaust involvement. As author Bernhard Schlink wrote about his novel, on which the film is based, \\"The Reader is not a story about redemption or forgiveness. It is about how my generation of Germans came to terms with what the generation before us had done.\\" He challenges the viewer with transcending guilt, the ability to choose love and the complexity of monstrous actions undertaken by ordinary people. The film is splendidly emotional and comes very close to being phenomenal. The drawn out conclusion is a meditation on the power of love and its ability to overcome exceptionally trying junctures - and even to overcome time itself. Morally devastating but not emotionally involving enough to attain instant masterpiece status, The Reader still boasts outstanding performances, a beautiful score and a moving tale of complex affection.<br /><br />- Mike Massieuthor Bernhard Schlink wrote about his novel, on which the film is based, \\"The Reader is not a story about redemption or forgiveness.

B001GZ6QDS|2.0|We've all seen the movie (many of us multiple times) and the general consensus is that the film will be winning many awards. No need to keep repeating what everyone already knows. This is simply a review of the DVD, NOT THE MOVIE.     Let's get right to the point..The Dark Knight Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy  has nothing special in it. This \\"Special Edition\\" DVD has NO directors and/or cast commentary, NO deleted or extended scenes, NO cast commentary, NO behind the scenes or the making of feature, and NO special effects behind the scenes feature. Basically everything you would expect to come in a DVD (especially a Two-Disc) is not in this one. If you only watched the 2nd disc of this Two-Disc edition you would never know that the late Heath Ledger was in it. There is no tribute or in memory of or any type of mention of Heath Ledger's death in this DVD. We all know we bought this DVD the day it came out assuming there would be more scenes of Ledger's \\"Joker\\" or some type of interview or extra footage of Ledger on set. Instead all we get with this DVD is basically the movie we saw in the summer transferred to a disc for us to take home. I could have just brought a camera to the theaters and taped it myself if I would have known that's all I would be getting by paying another $20 for this so called \\"Special Edition\\" DVD.    It is quite clear that the powers that be at Warner Brothers looked to capitalize even further on the box office success of the \\"Dark Knight\\" by pumping out this lame excuse for a DVD just in time for the holiday season knowing that we would eat up the DVD just as fast as we did with the film in the theaters. What's even more disheartening is that in about 3 months times from now, when the \\"Dark Knight\\" buzz has died down after the holidays and after the awards season, Warner Brothers will release the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" or \\"Extended Edition\\" DVD, whatever they end up calling it, this will be the DVD we all thought we were buying the first time around. Knowing that the film very well could walk away with a couple Oscars, a rerelease immediately following is a definite. We all saw the film enough times in theaters that we deserve a worthy DVD with all the appropriate features that compliments the film. Screw You Warner Brothers, I want my money back.
B001ECQ75A|1.0|The title wrapper on the case was torn all to pieces, so I was a little bit concerned with the dvd inside.  I opened it and found the dvd to be good shape, it was not scratched up or broken like had suspected.  However, when I tried to play it my dvd player it could not be read, so I tried it in another player....same message.  I tried it is 3 dvd players total and was unable to view it on any of them.  Very dissapointed.  The return and refund process was very simple and easy. I was very thankful for that.
B00004WN62|5.0|Some of the reviews here are for different versions of this LP. The stereo LP I'm reviewing is the absolute best version of Axis available. It's on Amazon here: [...]  It's listed as  a Label: Boss Entertainment release, LP Record (October 28, 2008) but is more accurately the Back To Black 60th Vinyl Anniversary pressing on heavyweight 180 gram vinyl in all original packaging. All Analog Pressing. (The 60th anniversary this series commemorates is Universal Records 60th anniversary).  I used to think the 200gr mono version LP was great, and it is, but this is the definitive version of Axis. Absolute perfection! Nice quiet vinyl, thick, heavy, flat, just a terrific reproduction. I've never heard a better version of Axis, and I've got many different CD & LP pressings.  Do not hesitate, get this now! You won't regret it.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Good movie, but too predictable for many adults.  It would have been good to seed real doubt on the survivalability of the Hulk, to show a vulnerability to make the suspension of belief easier.  Other than that it was a fun film and I recommend it.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|This is the 'unofficial' Bond and it's not included in the big box set, so that is why I purchased it so I could have them all.      I got it for a good price and also it came in about a week.  Came in good condition as if I bought it from a regular store.  No complaints.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|This film was fun, allot is happening, but it moved too fast.  They could have paused in the action longer to build suspense and drama.  Good movie for children but lacks the adult hooks.
B000003S0K|5.0|I can't believe Brian Eno isn't played on classic rock radio stations in America (and probably not in Europe either).    The guy is obviously an experimental genius because every single song on Here Comes the Warm Jets sounds much different from the other ones.  Not only that but each song is VERY melodic.  So the guy totally nails diversity, creativity and melody.  That's why Brian Eno should be remembered more than he currently is (let's be honest here- most of the people who remember Brian Eno are either from somewhere in Europe or people who frequently surf the internet.      Ask anyone in America who doesn't own the internet and most likely they've never even heard of the guy- sad fact indeed).    But, that's how it is I guess.  People assume we should remember David Bowie but not Roxy Music and Brian Eno.    Anyway, with THAT silly little rant out of the way, let's get down to   business- Here Comes the Warm Jets is Brian Eno's best album (in my opinion of course) because of the diversity and the jaw-droppingly fascinating creative ideas.  It's an album that truly defines \\"underrated\\" because, despite 60 reviews so far, the average person has no idea who Brian Eno even is.    The opening track contains emotional beauty immediately the way the vocals rock *and* sound sad (at the same time).  Strange, but true.  \\"Baby's on Fire\\" has SCORCHING hot guitar soloing for the most part, with catchy vocals taking place when that incredible guitar playing is not being heard.  \\"Cindy Tells Me\\"is a beautiful pop song and any Beatles fan would probably love it.    Let's jump around a bit- the title song is a bit repetitive, but not   annoying or anything.  Maybe a minute or two overlong though.  I guess when the vocals kick in at the end it gets a bit better.  \\"On Some Faraway Beach\\" is INCREDIBLE the way it builds calmly and emotionally into a vocal melody that just makes you wanna scream in tears- it's *that* good!      \\"Blank Frank\\" takes a completely different turn fromthe rest of the music and sounds pretty noisy, but not STRAIGHT annoying noise or anything- clever, melodic noise. An odd song this one is.  But the STRANGEST thing I've ever heard Brian Eno do is \\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" and let me tell you, THIS is freakin' something else.  Can't explain it- you just need to hear it.  \\"Some of Them are Old\\" just flat out rules.  Love those vocals and what sounds like a banjo solo.  Pretty cool.  Wasn't expecting something like THAT on a bizarre pop album.    Overall, I'm very impressed with this album and consider it a notch better than Roxy Music and even most of David Bowie's work (yes, even better than Heroes and Low).
B001IUG3CU|1.0|Yes, let's compensate for the crappy music by using the 'novel' idea of four different covers.    This along with their Wallmarket promotion strategy shows you the wonders that marketing to intellectual adolescents can achieve.       It took them eight years to just bring us some more unoriginality and childish cliches. These guys suck in their music and attitude. If you had more people like Angus, their kind of music would never have been invented. Angus would be going, 'rock? Who needs that? Check out this cool banjo solo!' *duck walks*     In terms of sheer mindlessness ACDC and Miley Cyrus are in the same boat.     Whoa!! How rock n' roll can you get?
B00015TOCY|5.0|This is probably the most underrated album Brian Eno made in the 70's, if only for the fact people seem to prefer to mention the previous album (Here Comes the Warm Jets) and the one after Tiger Mountain (Another Green World).  So it makes sense Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy is going to receive less attention.    But, you know, this album *deserves* to be mentioned along with the other two albums, because as far as quality songwriting goes this album is pretty darn good.  Not to mention, weirdly diverse, something Brian Eno was very very good at.    The first song on the album is a MAGNIFICENT pop song with wonderful vocals all around.  It's a bit short, but it's fantastic in every single way.  I absolutely love it.   Heck, it's probably in my top 5 favorite Brian Eno songs.    \\"Back in Judy's Jungle\\" has a jungle/circus like vocal section.  Pretty neat.  It's extremely memorable.  The next track (\\"Fat Lady in Limbourgh\\") reminds me of the Beatles.  Speaking of the Beatles, \\"Mother Whale Eyeless\\" has a style of songwriting that can be considered on the same level as many classic Beatles song.  Yes, you read me correct!    \\"The Great Pretender\\" is just very very bizarre, but AGAIN, the vocals are incredible.  Brian Eno has creative songwriting talent.  Everyone who's heard this album knows that.  \\"The True Wheel\\" and \\"China My China\\" are memorable for the catchy vocal melodies (like the rest of the album for that matter) and so is \\"Put a Straw Under Baby\\".  The only song that's a bit out of place and highly unusual is \\"Third Uncle\\".  Good song, but a bit TOO weird even for me.  It has a good rhythm section though!    Only the title song doesn't WOW me very much.  Nice piano playing, but Eno is no Elton John.  I highly recommend the album though.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder: a kind-of documentary about the making of a war movie called....Tropic Thunder. I'd heard this was a pretty good movie, but I just couldn't believe it was worth a move to the top of my viewing queue. Well...albeit late to the party almost a month after its release on Blu Ray...Tropic Thunder surprised me in several ways.<br /><br />First and most important...this movie was really good! Too often these days comedies aren't funny; in fact most lean towards stupidity rather than genuine humor. Tropic Thunder's deliberately over the top performances, combined with well-done satire and good writing, will keep a smile on your face from start to finish.<br /><br />The next surprise came in the form of surprise performances and cameos. The cameos were expected, because Ben Stiller always has them in his movies. But the biggest surprise was the actor in the role of Tropic Thunder's studio head, a brash, [[ASIN:B0007QS324 Ari Gold-like]] character...it stole the show. Hilarious.<br /><br />Actually, now that I think about it, that studio head role was just one of many hilarious performances in the movie. Stiller and Jack Black were great at spoofing spoiled actors. Robert Downey Jr and his politically incorrect portrayal of an African American was comical...especially the way his character was received by fellow African American actor Brandon T. Jackson.<br /><br />Tropic Thunder  was a very good, funny movie. Thoroughly entertaining. Oh, and the last surprise was that I thought the [[ASIN:B001H5X7I4 theatrical release]] was a PG-13...it wasn't. And this Director's Cut earns its R-rating, so use discretion if you have younglings in the house like I do.
0553381407|4.0|What we experience in childhood shapes us as adults.  Our parents play a major role in that.  No surprises there.  And plenty has been written on the topic.  Susan Forward establishes her niche by encouraging readers to go ahead and get angry about... and grieve for... the various things that didn't go as we'd have hoped in childhood.  She advocates confronting \\"toxic parents\\" as a way to get beyond the damage done and \\"reclaim your life,\\" i.e. start living in the present, without the emotional baggage of the past.  Susan also encourages readers to forgive themselves if they can't - for whatever reason - maintain a close, loving relationship with one or more parents.  Most importantly, she encourages readers to put the blame where it belongs and not keep accepting the child's conclusion that \\"anything done to me is my fault.\\"<br /><br />This book is a nice counterpoint to others on the subject.  I also highly recommend David Richo's compassionate East-meets-West book, \\"How to Be an Adult in Relationships - The Five Keys to Conscious Loving\\" for more insights on how to move beyond the past and reclaim your life.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen.  It is definitely a good purchase to watch over through the years.  (It's a keeper!)
B000002A46|5.0|This is by far the best CHristmas CD I have ever heard and purchased.  It is Mariah at her BEST.  Favorites:  ALL but O Holy Night and Jesus, What a Wonderful Child just make me want more and more.  Now this is MUSIC.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase this CD.  I PROMISE!!!!!!
B000VWOV3O|1.0|I kind of have to agree with M. Chapman on some of what he says here. I decided to give three of these original album classics a shot (Patti Smith, Byrds and Mahavishnu Orchestra). I am a collector of the japanese mini LP box sets. However the economy being what it is I have had to pass up a few of the one's I would have like to have gotten. In the case of the Patti Smith box, for example, we're talking about around $200 for the Japanese mini LP box vs a hair under $30 for the Original Album Classics box. I just got all three of the boxes I ordered in the mail today and all I can say is you will very definately notice every last one of those $170 dollars difference between the US vs the Japanese sets. And I do not mean that in a good way.<br /><br />Now I don't know what M Chapman is talking about with regards to any liner notes being out of date as these boxes include absolutely nothing beyond whatever the front and back cover artwork of the original albums were (and NO gatefolds by the way!). In the case of the Mahavishnu Orchestra discs that means you get the songs and line up's more or less and the occasional \\"I worship at the feet of the golden smurf\\" poetry. What you do NOT get are ANY sort of protective innersleeves - . I am not talking about the Japanese detail to the first pressings like the original CBS advertising inners. I am talking about anything at all that would have prevented 2 of the discs to fall right out of the covers when I removed them from the box and fall onto the pavement! For that alone I will dock this set 1 point - that is just unbelievably cheap and stingy on the part of whoever made these. Secondly you won't get the 1 sheet inserts that came with a few of the original albums: again: something that would have been SO inexpensive for the label to duplicate and inclue that the ommision of these is just stingy. There goes another point for that. Finally: Visions Of The Emerald Beyond... one of my all time favorite LP covers. One of my all time favorite GATEFOLD LP covers. And Columbia reproduces it as a cheap looking non gatefol issue here. In a box that purports to includes replicas of the original LP sleeves. In the case of the Mahavishnu box that means one less point. Would it have killed Columbia to make that ONE sleeve a gatefold?<br /><br />Finally the covers themselves are made of really cheap cradstock. This means they have minor scuffs on them from the moment you remove the shrinkwrap. This might not mean anything to the casual buyer who just wants to get 5 cd's cheap (and I WILL credit the US recod companies for that one small favour: at least these sets ARE cheap - because they certainly are NOT worth a penny over let's say $30, if that) but for a collector or for future resale value that kind of means that the packaging could never be called \\"Mint\\" or even a true \\"Mint Minus\\": and THAT pisses me off big time as a collector. Yet one more point. Leaving this particular Mahavishnu box as a 1 star rated box in my opinion. On the Byrds and Patti Smith's they were all single sleeved covers to begin with. In the case of the Patti's every single one of the original albums had lyric sheets - not one of these do. In the case of the Byrds set... well I have to give that point back because none of them were gatefolds and none of them came with inserts...<br /><br />And here's my main problem with the entire series: When I was a kid growing up in the 60's and 70's I remember the phrase \\"Made In Japan\\" as something that was a catch all phrase for when something would be an inferior and extremely flimsy and cheap knockoff of a US made product. Here the US record companies are taking an idea for boxsets that the Japanese pretty much invented and make so lovingly and caringly. And the US record companies make an EXTREMELY low budget flimsy and cruddy looking knock off. I won't be purchasing any further volumes of this series. You get what you pay for and as a collector it IS worth the extra $100+ dollarsto get the well made Japanese mini LP box with the incredible attention to detail etc. Those are gorgeous to look at and they hold their value and they are worth every expensive penny they cost to buy. These one's here? They'll never escalate in value and they all but scream \\"Cheap Cheap Cheap!\\". The best thing I can say about them is that unlike 5 jewel box cd's they take up a lot less space. But at least in the jewel box versions you got nice booklets with all the artwork and great liner notes. You just do NOT win with these original Album Classics box sets. Which is really sad: for once the US record industry COULD HAVE gotten things right and created an inexpensive collectable that would have been something very cool to own at a great price. But once again they got just about every single aspect of the whole thing wrong and utterly fail to understand what makes the collector buy these sorts of sets in the first place. Yeah: you have the music and the music still sounds great. But you can get that music - and have been able to get that music - for years now in jewel box format with superior packaging. If these boxsets are geared towards collectors like me who were looking forward to replacing their jewel box versions of these cd's and hoping to save some money by not buying the expensive Japanese boxset equivalents then once again the US record industry did not even come close. It's true that you cannot play the packaging, but when you create a series geared towards the collector then to the true collector packaging is every bit as important as the music...anese mini LP box with the incredible attention to detail etc. Those are gorgeous to look at and they hold their value and they are worth every expensive penny they cost to buy.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The collection is quite complete, however, the first of the series is still the best movie.
B0000029PC|3.0|There are so many excellent recordings of these works that any trumpeting of Szell's rigid versions of them with his usual preference for metallic sound, clumsy transitions, and heavy-handed rubato is bound to sound like mere partisan positioning, misinformation based on lack of exposure to what's possible with these works, or simple nostalgia for things past.<br /><br />Of course, it's all very muscular, tightly reigned-in, and rigorous, but that's not even what a Schumann piece should sound like. There is very little of the tenderness of heart and the passion of the mind, and none of the delicacy of feeling and sense of spontaneity, that stand behind the fundamental thrust of these works and their aspiration. And where is all the love for this music? Szell sounds like he certainly has none, and you're likely to not develop any, either, unless you seek out the all so very different but in their own way equally valid alternatives given to us by the likes of Barenboim (interesting mixture of old and new in interpretation, in very good modern sound), Sinopoli (a personal favorite, similarly in better sound than these), Sawallisch (many like his \\"light\\" approach which is fine with these particular works, but it can sound a bit bland and undifferentiated), Klemperer (always so masterly in highlighting what the work is really all about and how it goes), and first and foremost Furtwaengler (who however only left us with a couple of these, but his 4th is unforgettable and one of the finest examples of his art, simply glorius if there is such a thing as glorious music on earth; however, the sound is mono, for those who care).<br /><br />Be honest: how many have actually managed to listen through these very taxing performances on one sitting? This music can be so interesting and beautiful but unfortunately not much of that is in evidence on these recordings. Upon hearing them, one starts feeling discouraged in life, empty and somehow vaguely down. And that from Schumann?!? Seeking the source with the greatest fidelity, I even went for the SACDs of the same for fair measure, but they of course only put Szell's characteristic qualities into a greater relief. So, for the Szell collectors and Schumann completists with a historical bent only, is my bottom line (and even they should be wary of the many alterations Szell made to the score). The rest of us who just want their Schumann served as Schumann should are better off looking elsewhere.rce with the greatest fidelity, I even went for the SACDs of the same for fair measure, but they of course only put Szell's characteristic qualities into a greater relief.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|When I saw the first advertizing for this show and noticed that Paul Giamatti would have the leading role in HBO's mini-series [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]], I had my doubts that he could pull it off.  However, after the first episode, I was completely hooked.  Giamatti ended up more than \\"pulling it off\\", he did an outstanding job, doing justice to McCullough's wonderful novel [[ASIN:141657588X John Adams]].<br /><br />The producers took the time to do it right--costumes, set-design... even using the language of the day.  At some points it was a challenge to easily penetrate the eloquent prose of the day; but it also made the production more genuine... as if I were transported back to the time period.<br /><br />I've ordered by copy online so we may enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />John Cathcart<br />Award-winning author of \\"Delta 7\\"

0956010903|4.0|This kind of purchase, for me, was strictly for \\"collectable\\" reasons.  I am keeping this edition in the condition it came, plastic wrapper and all and purchasing the paperback to actually read.  This collectable edition is really quite exciting.  The book itself is small, about the size of a paperback book, it has faux purple jewels on the cover and is decorated with metal-like material in the middle and on the corners.  It comes in a beautiful velvet bag with a drawstring.  The book in the bag is then nestled in the larger hide-away book.  This hide-away book houses the collector's edition jeweled book and a folder which contains drawings by J.K. Rowling herself.  The prints are interesting.  Only one of the bunch is my taste to actually frame and hang.  I recommend this collectable edition as a \\"collectable\\".  The hide-away book is big.  The width and length are similar to a large laptop.  I am not dissapointed in what I received at my front door.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan and this collector's edition seemed to me to be a good investment.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|If you are thinking about buying the special edition for the \\"Digital Copy\\", you should reconsider.<br /><br />I ripped the digital copy to my XP machine.

1400082773|5.0|I gave this book to my husband, who did not put it down.  His wonder at the fresh prose, the honesty of the writing and the insight into growing up black and white are unparalleled.  This book is much better than anything else written by a political figure, and I am glad it makes the writer financially independent as well.
143911000X|4.0|This book was hysterical and is the best and most complete collection of historical Bro doctrine ever available.  The novelty kind of wears off about half way through the book so its difficult to get through the other half but there are still some treasures beyond the half-way point.  After reading it through, it still makes for quick laughs as a reference every now and then.
B0009MAO46|5.0|My little boy, Finn, who is 3, has taken to waking up in the middle of the night and the only thing that will get him down again is Toy Story, so I have seen this every night for the last 6 months, and I still love it, in fact as an adult, I went to the cinema to see it without kids! Of course, there are many plotting inaccuracies. How come the Toys have never been caught moving? Their early warning system seems a little hap-hazard to say the least. And when Scud the dog is pulling Woody off the back of the removal truck, the loading ramp would have to be about 5 feet off the ground making Scud the size of a Shetland pony! And when they light the rocket, it is unlikely that Woody would be able to steer RC because of the small size of the wheels compared to the thrust applied, and when Woody falls limp in the petrol station as the big tanker arrives, the wheel that nudges up against him is not the front wheel, but one of the rear wheels on the tractor unit, he would have been crushed by that stage. And why didn't the truck driver or the car drivers at the end see the toys and report it to the press? And surely RC would have been thrown away by Andy as Woody drops the remote control in the road when the battery runs out, and RC would be no-good without a remote. And how come some toys speak and some don't, and how does Lenny speak, he has no mouth? And how come Mr Potatohead never loses any of his parts that drop off all of the time? And anyone who has ever played the drop and grab games that Buzz and Woody are \\"won\\" by Sid in know that the air displaced by a cruising jetliners 36,000 feet overhead will displace anything you manage to pick up, so Woody would have been able to pull Buzz free easily. And when Sid's toys pop out the light housing in the porch to lower Duckie to ring the bell, the hole is too small to get the fitting back in again. And when Buzz falls out of the window, why doesn't he just stand in the drive and wave up saying he is ok? And what happensto the paratroopers that drop off the landing at the start, when the other troops abseil down the skipping rope, they have gone. And why should Woody have a Laser? He is a cowboy!  Some people (\\"Johnny One-Stars\\", I call them) will believe the above comments are serious.       As you can see, I have seen this film too many times, and seriously, I love it. Suitable for kids from 2 to 102. Mind you, my granny is 103 and I couldn't recommend it for her since I persuaded her that the Nirvana lyric, \\"can you feel my love buzz\\" was been sung by Woody and it ruined it for her. I fear she sees Woody and Buzz in a remake of Brokeback Mountain and that's just too much!

B00008G8M4|3.0|This is a great film until you get to the part where Will Smith punches the alien and says \\"Welcome to Earth\\". And then the wheels come off big style. Lots to like in this film, V-Style giant dustbin lid flying saucers, lots of action, but the gung-ho lameness of the \\"USA, USA\\" patriotism is the sort of stuff that has the 5 and three quarter billion people in the world who are not American covering their eyes with embarrassment. It is somehow fitting that the climax to the film involves Randy Quaid flying up the bottom of one of the giant binlids..still, as a man, we need a fix of explosions and aliens and jets and stuff like that, and there is plenty of that going on. And just in case you think I'm a big meany, I quite liked Battlefield Earth apart from the hideously lame end (and insult to all Harrier Jump-Jet Pilots everywhere), and \\"War of the Worlds\\" which also had a totally lame end, although I'm sure a positive impact on real-estate prices in downtown Boston (handy for the shops and alien proof!). I'm sure that if an ill tempered alien race had the technology to send a fleet of giant binlids interstellar distances, they could crush us like ants without even taking their alien sausage sandwiches out of their mouths.     Mind you, if they did arrive, I expect that the Number One quisling collaborator in their alien conquest would be Tom Cruise. Why, he is probably talking to them already, by e-mail. Why does this tinfoil hat make my head itch?

B001EYGOEM|5.0|It was amazing! Hey Stephen is my favorite.  Her songs have a bit of a more modern twist but they are very true to her sound.  I personally liked this album best.  If you like country or Taylor Swift you should definitely buy it!

0670020745|5.0|I was very interested in reading this book because my mother had a brain aneurysm four years ago. It is an amazing account of one woman's journey and incredible that she lived to retell her story.  For anyone that has wondered what is going on in people's minds that are in a coma, this is enlightening.  I would recommend everyone to read this book.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Once in a while, brother. Every once in a while, a movie lives up to the hype and the buzz. THE DARK KNIGHT not only is a near-perfect superhero film but it also happens to be one of the best crime dramas I've ever seen. I hear people are comparing it to HEAT and even to THE GODFATHER II (which, okay, might be reaching). Irregardless, it's already a modern classic.<br /><br />The Batman has at last established himself as Gotham City's dark protector. His intimidating influence and reputation are such that, nowadays, organized crime syndicates conduct their meetings in broad daylight. A triumvirate of the Batman, honest copper Jim Gordon and crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent has managed to put away a sizable chunk of Gotham's criminal element. Hope dawns on the horizon.<br /><br />Then the Joker makes big noise and abruptly shatters the status quo. The film opens with the Joker masterminding a daring daytime bank robbery, which is only the opening salvo in his plan to unleash total chaos on Gotham City. Contracted by the mob to eliminate the Dark Knight, he broadcasts an ultimatum: remove the mask, Batman, and turn yourself in or people will begin dying. When he doesn't, they do.<br /><br />Bruce's lifelong friend and former flame Rachel Dawes remains the Batman's incremental personal ray of hope; the dream of being with her, once Gotham is redeemed, is in part what keeps him going in his unrelenting war against crime. But Rachel has moved on and is seeing Gotham's golden boy, Harvey Dent. Very crucial to the plot is the charismatic Dent, and his operatic fall from grace. Maggie Gyllenhaal,  replacing Katie Holmes, and Aaron Echkart are good, in a cast of luminaries.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT, despite its superhero trappings, is serious cinema. It has your geek-out moments, delivering its share of charged action sequences and Easter eggs for those comic book fans who know what to look for (one thug's attempt to take off Batman's mask, for example, is right out of the Hush story arc). But its flawless craftsmanship renders it the most grown up superhero movie yet. The complex screenplay, deftly written by Director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, touches on very dark themes and calls into question what it means to be Gotham's guardian. And, with the Joker's entrance, the audience is rapidly thrown off its comfort zone. Although marked by the absence of gore and bloodletting, there is startling violence and unremitting tension.<br /><br />Christian Bale reprises his understated role as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but he is almost, almost, reduced to secondary relevance, behind the Joker. If you take out all the hubbub surrounding Heath Ledger's passing, what's left is still one of the most glittering performances ever accomplished by a film actor. Ledger sinks utterly into his role; all we see is the creepiness, the unpredictabilty, and the vicious intelligence of the homicidal clown. Alfred, in a conversation with Bruce Wayne, perhaps best sums up the Joker's defining characteristic: \\"Some men aren't looking for anything logical. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\\" Hands down - with mad respect to Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and even Mark Hamill - this is the best interpretation of the Joker yet. Should Ledger be nominated for an Oscar? Absolutely! The Golden Globes has already put him on the ballot.<br /><br />This is not to devalue the performances of the rest of the cast, because each actor here is pitch perfect. But consider Heath Ledger as the first amongst the peerless. Gary Oldman is superb, and I'm so glad that, this time, Jim Gordon isn't relegated to afterthought status, and Michael Caine and my dude Morgan Freeman are, as ever, class acts.<br /><br />But I can't stop talking about the Joker. Heath Ledger's take is that the Joker isn't a common criminal as much as an anarchist, and a deranged anarchist, at that. The Joker doesn't careabout ill-gotten gains; he cares about tearing down Gotham's governing infrastructure. And he dearly longs to obliterate the values of man, to deconstruct the way man looks at himself. His two main targets are Harvey Dent and the Batman, and he tries his mightiest to mold them into his personal philosophy: \\"You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\\" It's fascinating how he constructs twisted scenarios and pits his victims against impossible choices. As his psychological games escalate to more horrifying stakes, the question becomes: to what depths will the Batman, Dent, Gotham's Finest, and the citizens of Gotham steep to, to survive? And, in light of what the Batman ends up doing, it's rather hard to deny that he's as much a very disturbed vigilante as he is a caped crusader. Irregardless, the Dark Knight ends up tarnished.<br /><br />I like that we never do learn the Joker's backstory. All we're left with is a handful of stories, as spun by the Joker himself, about the origin of his ghastly scars. None of these stories match. It's better that way. The Joker is unpredictable and unreadable. Like chaos. And if the Joker symbolizes evil and chaos, my thinking is that the Batman in turn doesn't necessarily represent the good in man but, rather, that tiny sliver of hope (and good) in man. Did that make sense?<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT is endowed with great one-liners (mostly from the Joker) and several perfect scenes, from the bank heist sequence at the start of the film to the Joker's crazy whimsical exit from the hospital to the Joker's verbal manifesto delivered whilst hanging upside down. The pencil vanishing trick is terrific, not only for its shock value but for the charge it sends up the audience's spine. After seeing that, I no longer had doubts that this Joker would be something awesome.<br /><br />The film is near-perfect. Near-perfect because there are some things which bugged me. As I put on my nitpicking hat, I can't help but be bothered by Bale's guttural Batman voice, which seems to channel Clint Eastwood, if he were a chain smoker. I know that it takes time to rebuild the Wayne mansion and the Bat Cave (destroyed in BATMAN BEGINS), but I miss them, anyway. And, while I dig Batman's motorbike and its massive tires, I question the practicality of wearing a cape while riding this thing. The Joker is truly diabolical this time out, so diabolical that the Batman is reduced mostly to re-acting to his ploys, which is very unBatman-like. And I don't think much of his cowl/helmet, either. But, like I said, I'm nitpicking. To me, these are tiny flaws.<br /><br />I was expecting more from the special features. No audio commentary, no bloopers, no documentary about Heath. Disc 1 has the featured presentation. Disc 2 has these: \\"Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene\\" focuses on two segments \\"The Sound of Anarchy\\" (the score and sound design, as tailored to the Joker's insanity) and \\"The Evolution of the Knight\\" (about the Batman costume and gadgetry and the IMAX effect); The IMAX-related sequences are presented in their original frame (includes sequences in the opening bank robbery, the Batman's aerial flight in Hong Kong, the armored car chase, Bruce's Lamborghini getting effed up, Batman and the Joker's face-off at Chicago's Prewitt building near the end, and the final scene); \\"Gotham Tonight\\" - 6 cleverly done (and fake) television broadcasts from Gotham Cable's Premier News Program, nicely hosted by Anthony Michael Hall and real-life (and very hot) L.A. TV news reporter Lauren Sanchez, and offering in-depth looks at and interviews with several of the main characters, as well as fleshing out the storyline even more (I got a bit of a chuckle at Jim Gordon's explanation for the Bat beacon, when asked by the press); and the galleries (poster art and production stills) and 3 DARK KNIGHT trailers.<br /><br />When you exit from this film, my guess is you won't be doing cartwheels or skipping to the park with mad abandon. It's simply not a feel-good movie. As THE DARK KNIGHT ends, Gotham's future is still tainted and, even though Batman defeats his villains, the values he's compromised and the things he's had to do leave one wondering if the Joker hadn't won out after all. A personal dichotomy is that while I consider THE DARK KNIGHT to be a masterpiece and while I relish and appreciate its brooding theatrics, I don't quite prefer it to the likes of SPIDER-MAN 2, SUPERMAN II and IRON MAN, which are sunny celebrations of the superhero mythos. THE DARK KNIGHT provokes, in its bleakness and ambiguity and stark exploration of madness and motivation and the meaning of heroism. And, as a comic book junkie, I'm not sure I'm mature enough to handle that.<br /><br />Even as I'm compelled to see it for a fourth time.n't help but be bothered by Bale's guttural Batman voice, which seems to channel Clint Eastwood, if he were a chain smoker.

B001HPP2X2|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating, addictive, and entertaining shows to ever grace the TV palette. Michael C. Hall's impersonation of Dexter Morgan is absolutely uncanny; he is dark, charismatic, mysterious and extremely unsettling. This is truly an exceptional character; a sociopath with a conscience. You have to see to understand how exquisite this show is - a new depth added to an on-screen personality development.
0375831002|5.0|[[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]]    For some reason this marvelous and compelling work of fiction is labeled as Young Adult.  The topic certainly isn't, as the other books of Zusak are.  It takes a few pages to get into the author's style, but after you arrive, the journey and characters are unforgettable.  I have recommended this book to everyone who has ears.

0375701427|5.0|American Pastoral is the story of Swede Levov , a Jewish All-American hero from Newark, NJ in post WWII America.  A three sport athlete and superstar at Weequahic High, everything seems to come easy for Swede.  After graduation, he does a hitch in the Marines, returns home to New Jersey, attends college, and marries Miss New Jersey.  He takes over his father's successful glove making business, moves to the Jersey suburbs and lives in the house of his dreams.  Appearances, however, are not as they seem.  The Levov's have one daughter, Merry.    Ah, Merry (who is anything but what her name might imply)!  Merry is a precocious child and the apple of Swede's eye.  She is pampered and doted on by her father, but somewhere along the line something goes haywire.  Growing up in the 60's, Merry becomes a passionate supporter of the anti-war movement.  She falls in with fanatical elements of the Weather underground  and, at the ripe old age of sixteen, plants a bomb at the local general store and blows it to smithereens!  An innocent bystander is killed and Merry goes into hiding.  She is henceforth legendized as \\"The Rimrock Bomber\\".      From this point forward, Swede lives a double life.  While maintaining the outward appearance of living an ethereal life in the suburbs, Swede inwardly struggles with the \\"why\\" of his daughter's atrocity; what did HE do to allow this to happen?  Where is she? Did she really do this? How can he help?  His suffering is both haunting and heroic.      Philip Roth's alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, a boyhood friend of Swede's brother Jerry, decides to write Swede's story after an encounter with Jerry at a high school reunion.  The results are gripping!    Many novels remind me of network TV - you read them and they fade into oblivion.  The characters and the plot line are a blur, if there are any memories at all.  Occasionally, a novel will take root and you will carry it with you forever - An American Tragedy and Sophie's Choice come to mind.  American Pastoral is a novel that will stay with you!

B00005NKKV|5.0|I have always declared myself as a non Simon and Garfunkel fan. Meaning, for the most part, they do nothing for me. But I won't say that there isn't a time and place for everything. Sometimes Simon and Garfunkel are just whats needed. If so, then I would have to make this Simon and Garfunkel album the one. The Sounds Of Silence.<br /><br />That title track has always put me on hold when I hear it. For the two minute duration, I freeze. Even when I was really young, I could see the beauty in this song.<br /><br />Now every so often I go visit some friends of mine in the city. Usually when I do this (I gotta take two trains to get there)I end up spending the night, because navigating my way back becomes way too much of a process. These friends of mine never seem to be able to keep up with my pace of steady beer drinking until the sun comes up, and at some point in the night, I will find myself alone in the living room, still drinking whats left of my beers, and rummaging through the records. On a particularly drunken evening, I threw this album on the turntable and cranked it... I realized that the title track is only the beggining. Just about every song is just as, if not more so, beautiful than the first.<br /><br />There is a fine mix of style here, and really (in my opinion of course), the best showcase of the Simon and Garfunkel talents with rich accompianment and solid harmonies. I can smell the attic dust on the record cover just thinking about it but you will love it if you are at least fifteen beers deep on those dank nights.

0385340990|5.0|This surprising epistolary style book is one of the best to come out of the new century.  Its deceptively simple veneer overlays some very deep human drama that most of us passed over.  It is good to be reminded of man's inhumanity to man and its rebounding influence down the years; yet be reminded of humanity's resilience and ability to forgive, if not forget.  A must-read....should be on high-school reading lists...another \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and we all love books with happy endings.
0451528956|5.0|A classic, without doubt, purchased for a 13-year-old who loves to read. Schools should assign this.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|A seemingly harmless person who is really an exceptional warrior and/or assassin?  Not exactly new.  'Matrix', 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', 'A History of Violence'.  All those movies have done it before.  'Wanted' isn't bad, but it's only worth renting.  James McAvoy's acting is just so-so.  The gun fights are cool, but any action scene involving a car in this movie is just stupid. Mostly because the CGI is well below the standards set by most big action/adventure movies these days.  If you are interested in this movie because of the comic book it's loosely based on, you're going to be very disappointed.  Rent it when you're in the mood for mindless violence.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I listened to all the previews first. I was happy with a few of them so I went a head and bought the whole album on Amazon MP3 downloader.

I would agree with some other reviews that the song \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" is a little Pop, but it is a good song.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|So many extra features.  The film itself looks beautiful in blu-ray.  The documentary on Pixar is over an hour long and very interesting.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />It is, quite simply, a masterpiece. This movie is one of those works that completely puts to the lie arguments that genre fiction, whatever the medium, is inferior to true \\"art\\" or \\"literature.\\"<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, David Goyer, and the army of creatives and techs involved in this work work very firmly in the comic book/pulp fiction vein, but they treat the tropes of genre with the appropriate seriousness, and have created a work of art to stand next to the best in film.<br /><br />Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and thus he is Batman, in a way no other performer ever has been. His dark intensity makes the man, his mission, and his torment very real.<br /><br />And Heath Ledger's Joker...sublime in his madness, joyful in his violence, brilliant in his dire designs. If Ledger doesn't take a posthumous Oscar for this, there's something seriously wrong with the Academy (not that that's news, really, but still).<br /><br />This is classic filmic storytelling at its finest.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Dear Mr. Walker,    Your comments are laden with emotion and hate towards Mel Gibson. Comparing him to Joseph Goebbels, is stupid. Leni Riefenstahl, Segei Eisenstein, they did \\"trash\\". Propaganda disguised as art. Triumph of the Will, Battleship Potemkin, ..now that's \\"Adolf\\" worthy.     I've read your words, and they're nothing but insults. Words upon words, that add insult to injury, that's all... do you have anything else to give? Anything to offer.., your words are a one-trick pony, aimed towards defaming Mel.    Blah, blah, blah.., Adolf, blah, blah, blah, Goebbels.     Mr. Walker, did you hate the movie, before you saw it?    How else, can you make such comments?  You might as well.., be naming Saddam or O.J. Simpson. What did Mel, ever do, to you? Play Mad Max??    The Passion of the Christ (2004) made $611 million (worldwide). Roger Ebert described it, \\"The filmmaker (Gibson) has put his artistry and fortune at the service of his conviction and belief, and that doesn't happen often.\\" People responded.     You may hate it, Mr. Walker. But its shadow remains, it touched millions. \\"Is the film \\"good\\" or \\"great?,\\" is a question, Ebert pondered. \\"I imagine each person's reaction (visceral, theological, artistic) will differ,\\" he mused. And so it shall, we disagree, Mr. Walker. But you don't, see me, libel you, do you?    I use arguments and facts, not slings. \\"Really clever\\", \\"contempt for the facts\\", \\"the world's slimmest \\"Bible\\" travesty\\", these are your words. You go on, \\"Gospel bashing\\", \\"purely stupid nature\\", and \\"Satan as an embodiment of Judaism\\", wow!!! What great restraint! What do you call, an enemy?    The Passion of the Christ, is an important film, your vitriol, will not change that.     I wonder, if De Mille, would escape you, unscathed. (Joke Coming) Look out, it's the Heston Holocaust. Flea! Flea!

030738683X|5.0|I'd forgotten how much fun this novel is! Northanger Abbey was actually Austen's first completed novel as far as history knows, although it was published posthumously, long after her other works were published.   It's really the funniest and most satirical of all her novels, and the gothic tomfoolery is what kills me.  I just love it.       A brief plot summary is that the story's protagonist, Catherine, is invited to spend some time in Bath with some family friends, where she meets the characters that will carry out the various themes in the story, namely two sets of siblings:  Isabella and John Thorpe, and Frederick and Eleanor Tilney.  A recurring theme any Austen fan will recognize is that of first impressions and innocence giving way to deception and misunderstandings, as a young, naive Catherine finds that her dear new friend, Isabella, is not quite who she at first appears to be, and that all kinds of scheming and plotting are going on behind Catherine's guileless back - based mostly, of course, on gross misconceptions that will cause all manner of ruckus down the road.    The real jewel of this book in particular, though, is the hysterically funny and affectionately rendered spoof on the gothic suspense novel genre that was in its heyday during this period, a la' Radcliffe, Burney and Walpole.  Anyone familiar with The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho or any of the other gothic classics will really appreciate the humor.  I absolutely love the gothic suspense novel in all its forms, so I get a huge kick out of it.  The scene between Frederick and Catherine in the carriage on the way to Northanger Abbey where he teases her mercilessly (merciless because she's only about 2% sure she's being teased and is 98% wide-eyed with horror) about the abbey's dark corridors and hidden passages is so funny it makes me laugh out loud every time.  Catherine's discovery that the abbey is decidedly un-haunted, sadly lacking in cobwebs and absolutely devoid of gothicgloom is even more amusing.       There's a love story here too, and in fact a triangle or two, and as with all of Austen's stories, all's well that ends well.  Wonderfully soothing balm for the Austen-starved soul, and secretly my favorite of her books (I usually lie and say Mansfield Park is my favorite.  Sometimes Pride & Prejudice.  Or even Sense & Sensibility.  All lies.  Northanger Abbey is it, hands down).
B001GQACGE|3.0|I think the cd is pretty good. Especially the gray cd. I believe you will need to see the video to understand the meaning of If I were a Boy. If not some people may take it to mean something else. The gold cd has too many noises in the background. When I listen to it it is like I am in a zone and it is hard to get out. This can be dangerous if you are trying to drive. Overall it is a good cd.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie was brilliantly cast, and everyone in it is great.  It is a really fun movie, even if all the computer stuff is outdated now.  It's funny, it's intense, and it's one of River Phoenix's best performances, I thought.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Love the movie, hate that I blew $15 on this DVD.  Must've been asleep at the wheel when I ordered.  Received the 1-disc widescreen, no extras.  Feel like a dope.  Chalk up one more to experience.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I loved Polar Express the first time I saw it. Seeing it in blu-ray  was great.
0545128285|4.0|Not sure what I expected but I did get my hopes up a tad bit too high!!!  Anyone who has enjoyed the Harry Potter series (especially the deathly hallows) with enjoy this book.  It's a quick read only 100 pages.  It gives quite a bit of in-site (not that there isn't already enough from the 7 previous books) on the wizarding world .  Albus Dumbledore and JK Rowling give great references where the might be lots of questions and/or confusion.  Great little fairy tales with morals that we all can relate to.  Definetly worth the few bucks it cost for the book, and all of the proceeds go to needy children!  It's a great addition to the Harry Potter series and it gets a big thumbs up from me!!  (I didn't give it 5 stars because I did get my hopes up, and was let down just a hair. But that is my own foolishness).
1932907009|5.0|The book is clear and to the point dealing with screenwriting. The only problem I have, as someone completely new to the subject, is that I don't know the format for actually writing a screenplay. So, regardless of this treasure trove of information on writing a good screenplay, i'll most likely need another book to learn the screenplay typing format. This was an extremely fast read, and very entertaining and honest.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|I give the blu-ray version of Beetlejuice five stars for the picture and sound quality alone.  The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough.
0345479092|4.0|This book came highly recommended. I read it and the advice seems pretty solid. It was clear and easy to understand for someone starting with zero baby knowledge. I am still pregnant so I don't know how well the advice will work, but I do believe it is better than going in blind and just trying to wing it.
B001ED7C58|4.0|This soundtrack was something I was highly anticipating.  I was happy with the bands Paramore and Muse's contribution.  I was introduced to some interesting music in between, which at first listen I wasn't sure if I'd like.  However, after many rotations in my car CD player I would recommend anyone pick it up.  It is a great mix of some cool music.  There is a little on there for everyone, and yes, even a song sung by Rob Pattinson (edward himself).  So, if you are interested in expanding your musical tastesm for just one album, make it this one.
B0015FML06|5.0|Great to see footage of the new songs.  The first release on VHS decades ago did have one thing on it that this new DVD does not.  In the song The Electric Co, the VHS version shows Bono on top of the sound/spotlight pit in the middle of the audience.  This new version has that too, but the short improvisational verse from \\"Send In The Clowns\\" is missing from this new DVD.  Why?  A very minor deletion I know, but hey, it's on my old VHS tape, but is missing on this new DVD.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful DVD package.
B000IZJ1J8|3.0|After hearing all the hype about the Orange Goblin/Electric Wizard EP I figured I'd check out one of their albums. Well, the music is good but all the added noise starts to get on your nerves. The songs are sometimes way to long. What they could say in three minutes instead takes six. I don't know why OG ever decided to do an EP with them because OG just blows the Wizard off the map. Everybody is getting into the '70s metal sound now. Check out Down or even Fu Manchu. Alabama Thunderpussy, although not as heavy, is a better sound then these guys. If you want to hear really good music from this genre check out Orange Goblin's Frequencies From Planet Ten or Time Travelling Blues if you can find it.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Unfortunately most of the PS3 games don't support offline multi-player but if you have one of those offline multi-player games, then it is a must.    It is a very solid and durable product though one button stopped working with some games.    I like the fact that you charge it by plugging it into your PS3 and don't have to waste batteries like XBOX 360 controllers. Good approach Sony!
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I can tolerate John Mayer's earlier hits more than the other junk that's on the radio, but I never bought any of his earlier albums. As soon as I heard 'Waiting On the World To Change' I went out and bought this album straightaway. It helped that he started appearing in music magazine's top guitarists lists... and I feel like this album is the kind of music that he wanted to make when he started all this. He wrote those cute poppy numbers to be able to get to a place where he could write this new music. He has managed to combine his pop/singer-songwriter stuff with blues, to make a really great album that I think would appeal to both crowds. People joke when they hear I like him, but hey, he is a REALLY talented musician and it's time that those of us that value that start paying attention to him.
B00006GA48|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 1970. I remember it most because the song \\"I'm your captain/closer to home\\" played over and over on the PA system the day my ship returned home after an eleven month deployment overseas. Yep, will never forget that day!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I purchased this GPS receiver to assist in a GPS driven project. It was very reliable and easy to configure. Like most NMEA compliant receivers it comes with a virtual COM port driver to make communication very easy from any programming language with a serial addressing library (Python and PySerial were great).     I did not use it with commercial software but I foresee no issues.
B001B7CNY2|4.0|I'm a big fan of submarine movies and this is one of my favorites.  No matter how many times I watch it, the suspense always gets to me.  The pace of the film is excellent, always keeping you involved.    Regarding some critics here that question the historical accuracy, it's a \\"fictional\\" story based loosely upon the exploits of many brave men during WWII, American and U.K., but focusing on an American submarine crew.  At the end of the film, credit is given to many (if not all) crews that captured Enigma code materials during WWII, including the U.K. crews.  Maybe these critics didn't stick with the film long enough to see credit given to the real people that this film is honoring.  If you watch the bonus features included on the DVD, you will hear from the director/writer about how the story was developed, the research that was done, and the submarine training that the cast received.  He in no way is trying to say that the events in the movie actually happened.  He just wanted to do an exciting WWII submarine movie and pay tribute to the brave men who served on submarines in WWII.  I believe he said that he wanted to create a film that would allow people to \\"experience\\" what the characters in the film are experiencing and ask the question \\"would I be brave enough to do this?\\".  In my opinion, he absolutely succeeds.    I have only seen this film on standard DVD so I can't comment on the Blu-ray version.    One additional point discussed by the director... the German submarine crew is played by an all-German cast of actors rather than a bunch of American actors speaking German.  It may seem like a minor point, but it really adds to the movie experience.    I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good, suspenseful submarine flick.  If you are looking for a documentary or a morality film full of speeches and/or politically correct nonsense, look elsewhere.
0545128285|1.0|The worst rip-off.  Soo disappointing and I'll read anything.  Don't waste your money on this dog.

B001794FOK|3.0|Bought this on a whim because I figured it would look great on Blu-ray. I liked what the director had done in the past (Bourne Identity)and was not disappointed! Not going to say it is the greatest movie ever but it is a great addition to a blu-ray collection

0394800389|5.0|The note in the front of the book sums it up:  Be careful, this book is dangerous.  If you are looking for a lot of unusual and wacky tongue twisters which are truly hard, you need this book.  It's fun reading with young children and also a fun challenge for Intermediate to Advanced learners of English as a second language.  The artwork is classic Suess, too.
0375842209|5.0|This book is not the typical WWII memoir.  Because it is told from such a fresh and new perspective, it is able to shine a light on the third side of the war: the civilian side.  Since most of the focus on WWII is on the Holocaust or the actual warfront, it is great to see the war from a \\"normal\\" persons view and how it affected their daily life.  This is truly one of the most intriguing books I've ever read, and the irony that fills each page is unbelievable.  Overall, an AMAZING read
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I like John Legend a lot. This album as a good sound and I like the majority of the songs.

1401203078|1.0|Apparently, the authors decided they wanted to make a bad and tasteless comic, and they succeeded. Lots of gratuitous, bad and tasteless sex. Only half of the book is a readable comic, the rest is either incomprehensible, bad, or pages of unreadable text.

B000ASAEQW|5.0|This video ZAUBERFLOTE is very much better than Levine's for many reasons.  Starting with the glorious absence of Kathleen Battle who should be recording music for dentists' offices and nursing homes.  Instead we have beautiful authentic Lucia Popp who never forgot how it feels to be a little girl.  She wasn't German but she sure can SING German.  Kurt Moll in his relative youth is more virile and imposing as Sarastro than under Levine, frightening like Aslan in the NARNIA books, so good he makes you wonder how good YOU are.  Francisco Araiza also seems to have more at stake here than under Levine.  All this may be because of conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch who is much more brisk and youthful sounding than Levine.  (I don't think I've ever seen Mozart at the Met without thinking, too slow, too heavy, not true to Mozart's small-theater-oriented lightness of touch.  If there were an exception ZAUBERFLOTE would be it, it's the heaviest on \\"awesome\\" mode of Mozart's Big Five, but Levine overdoes even this.  It's like a museum, not a drama.)<br /><br />As a special treat, the Sawallisch video includes an appearance in a speaking role by veteran heavyweight superstar Kurt Boehme, who in his time was a renowned Sarastro.  This almost makes up for the omission of the short duet warning of women's wiles, which is usually sung by two priests in Act II just before the Three Ladies tempt Tamino and Papageno to speak.  The only thing I don't like about this video is Wolfgang Brendel who seems brutish and unchildlike as Papageno.  Conversely, under Levine, Manfred Hemm does a great job in that role.<br /><br />This performance is also better than others I've seen on video.  There's the one with Lazlo Polgar as Sarastro--he's a glorified baritone, not a true bass.  There are several with Matti Salminen, who has the biggest top in the bass world but no real bottom.  (He's like a TRex, the biggest and most dangerous dinosaur but with those little front limbs, at best useful only for picking meat out of carcasses.)  Kurt Moll is the only real infra-bass I've seen as Sarastro on video.  By \\"infra-bass\\" I mean someone who sings the bottom notes with no loss of relaxation or vibrato or richness of tone and gives the impression he could easily go further down.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are designed by the very famous August Everding, and they are a pleasure.t of carcasses.)

B00005LC1H|5.0|Much as I am loathe to start off with a cliche, cliches are cliches because they're true.     As many have said, Fawlty Towers is the single funniest TV series ever created. There's no argument, and no other series even comes close. It's like comparing the Beatles to other bands or Jimi Hendrix to other guitarists. Some artists just exist in their own singular dimension, and it's true of this show. What does one say, that it's the Mount Everest of television comedy? More like the rings of Saturn...    This masterpiece is given its proper honor in this fine box set, loaded with lengthy extras. The most surprising of these is the contemporary interview with Prunella Scales, revealing her to be a warm, charming and very sweet woman, which of course hammers home what a remarkable performance she gave in every episode of the show. And the same is true of the interview with Andrew Sachs, the immortal and incomparable Manuel.    Currently offered at a steep discount by Amazon, the price is in fact irrelevant. The set is worth twice, three times the cost, even if and perhaps especially if you've lived with the show since your youth. Every minute is just perfection, especially in terms of the writing, the quality of which is off the scale. And in every episode, episodes you may have seen dozens of times over the decades, there are countless laugh out loud scenes... even in cases where you know every line, where you anticipate every punch line, every fall, every double-take.    Most comedy doesn't bear up well to repeated playing but that's not the case here. Fawlty Towers is like a piece of great music, a classic album, in that its appeal never ends and in fact grows on the listener. It flourishes, it unfolds. In watching these episodes you see little things you never saw before, nuances of delivery that escaped you... and again, it's the writing... you relish every syllable, and if writing means something to you, you find yourself in awe of these scripts for there's not a line wasted.    I know, this review seems excessive in its praise, but I'll just end with the delicious fact that the British Film Institute named Fawlty Towers as the #1 Television Program of All Time.    Sheer unadulterated and relentless GENIUS.
031606792X|5.0|Let me start by saying that everyone is entitled to their own opinion & I respect opposing reviews. With that said, in my opinion, this is the best book in the Twilight Saga.     I began reading Twilight after seeing the preview for the movie. I'll admit that, initially, I was hesitant. \\"I'm 32 years old. Isn't this series for young adults?\\" I began reading anyway &, instantly, I was hooked. Everyday I went into work going on & on about how great the books are & everyday my co-workers looked at me like I'm nuts. Needless to say, many of them are now reading the books at a rapid pace. One co-worker told me that if her kids don't have Christmas, it's my fault. Another co-worker told me that if he fails out of college, that's my fault, too. It's really hard not to become addicted.     I know that Stephanie Meyer has been criticized for her writing style & the \\"happy endings\\" in regards to Breaking Dawn. Ok, to each his own. However, I adore her!!! Reading the Twilight Saga has been a nice form of escapism &, sometimes, you need that in life. I say take it for what it's worth & just enjoy it! It's a fun, romantic & absolutely lovely story. I'm thrilled with the way Breaking Dawn tied everything together. What's wrong with everyone getting what they want in the end? That's one of the perks to entering the fictional world that Stephanie Meyer has created. I'm not going into specific details about the book because I want people to read it for themselves. I took my time reading Breaking Dawn & it was worth every minute.    Breaking Dawn does have one downside...it's the end of a great story & I'm left wanting more from the Cullens.    Please enjoy!!!

B0000042MY|5.0|A lot of movies have great soundtracks, but to listen to this soundtrack by itself is incredibly moving and can stand alone without the film.  It takes you through every emotion and feeds your imagination. The Celtic style and sound plays deep into your soul. Highly recommended!!!
B001GQACGO|2.0|I'm going to give it to you straight!  I just have to rip the bandage off and let you guys deal with the pain.  Here it is.............. Sasha Fierce is not that Fierce!  There!  I said it.    I felt abandon and disrespect with this album.  It was all over the place and missing so so so so much.  I was confused and lost.  You know that feeling you get when you start to eat chicken and discover that part of it is raw?  That's that feeling you will have when you purchase this CD.      I get a feel that Beyonce wanted to show us her range in music but I just didn't get it!  I suggest you burn a copy from your friend or download it free.  It's not worth the plastic case the 2 (unnecessary) CDs in came in.
B000063JZQ|2.0|After reading the play, I was looking forward to watching the movie, thinking that maybe it would change my mind about the play. However, it didn't turn out to be what I expected. The movie made it hard for me to stay awake during class. I thought that the scene where the forest came towards Macbeth was portrayed poorly. I could barely tell that they were trees that the soldiers were carrying. Also, the fighting scene at the end was very unrealistic, which disappointed me because it was the scene I was looking forward to the most. This scene was not suspenseful, it was just amusing. I feel that the director could have taken more time to make the movie more believable. Although parts of the movie were not portrayed as clearly as the play, I did enjoy some parts of it. I would advise you not to buy the movie due to the fact that it is way over priced.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I love John Stephens.  I'm not a John Legend fan (brought for my iPod club) but I have to say that I enjoyed the entire CD. It was much mellower than the previous albums and I was refreshing not to have to listen to the screaming he does.  This album was different but in a good way.  Not your typical John Legend.  I think he may have tapped back into John Stephens (he has a CD under his name.  Check it out if you can.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As soon as I can get a blu-ray player, I purchased this fantastic set.  My teenager daughters love it as well.  As much as I love traveling, watching this is irreplaceable.  They took you to places that you wouldn't be able to reach.  The images are beautiful, making me to feel love Mother Earth even more and want to protect and preserve for future generations...  David Attenborough is an excellent narrator.   I have watched the Bird series and loved any BBC documentaries.  Definitely recommended for family entertainment.  We watch them as family movie nights.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Well, I took me at least three hours to fall asleep after watching this movie; because I kept hearing noises outside my window and door.<br /><br />If the Danvers State Insane Asylum were still in existence today, I would love to have taken a tour through the entire complex (wherever safe) with a few friends, two flashlights each, a cell phone and walkie-talkies. Especially in the subtunnels. What a creepy place.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this film because it wasn't the sudden \\"slasher around the corner\\" type. Which is why the pacing worked perfectly. The characters were great, as was the acting. The \\"run through the tunnel\\" while the lights were dying out in sequence, was especially horrifying. Marvelous writing and directing.<br /><br />If I were to be one of those Hazmat workers, it would probably have been the guy who was obsessed with the tape recordings of Mary Hobbes #444. That was spooky listening to those tapes. It kind of reminded me of my son's video game \\"Bioshock.\\"

B0000258CK|5.0|Prior to the release of her breakthrough album \\"Tapestry\\" in 1971, Carole King had already made a huge contribution to the pop/rock scene by writing for other stars such as Aretha Franklin (\\"Feel Like a Natural Woman\\"); Little Eva (\\"The Locomotion\\"), and The Shirelles (\\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\"). Other tunes such \\"You've Got a Friend\\" were popularized by other singers - in this case, James Taylor - so that her name was more of a footnote than one belonging to a widely recognized singer. \\"Tapestry\\" changed all that. Featuring her own songs that were popularized by other musicians as well as some new ones, King allowed her gutsy, honest style full reign. The public responded by keeping the album on the charts for a full six years.<br /><br />For those who lived through the 70s, it is astonishing to find the number of chart-topping tracks on this CD. Besides \\"You're Got a Friend,\\" \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" and \\"Feel Like a Natural Woman,\\" this CD contains \\"I Feel the Earth Move,\\" \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"It's Too Late,\\" \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Smackwater Jack,\\" and, of course, \\"Tapestry.\\" Surprisingly, these songs have endured decades, unlike much of the pop music of the era. King's forthright expression of emotion transcends the 70s sound and context.<br /><br />Women of a certain age and the guys who loved them should find memories embedded in every track, as this album was the unofficial dorm must-have from the mid-70s to the early 80s. Men looking for a romantic gift for women who grew up during that time (and have not replaced their vinyl records) could not make a better choice. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

B000QXDED6|5.0|This remarkable and inspirational film is a literal tranlatrion from a visual novel or comic book format novel based on the famous stand of Leonidas King of Sparta and his small army of volunteers at the pass of Thermopyle.  Because the director chose to make his movie resemble the picture/novel, it is not a life-like film, though close to that, but somehow, far more intense.  As in the original artwork, non-important details of background, character and plot and even of situation, are eliminated, and this elimination of detail allows us to focus all our attention on the power of the story.  And, it becmes all the more powerful because the story is true;  Leonidas did lead his men against the overwhelming masses of the Persian invaders, and although the Spartans did not stop the ivasion, they delayed it for a time, thereby teaching the invaders that conquest of the Greek city-states would cost them far more than they imagined.    As one would expect in a comic book or visual format devoted to the struggles of heroes, the Greek warriors are shown as a band of supremely beautiful, athletic and muscular athletes.  Physical magnificence overwhelms almost everything.  That kind of magnificence fiits the Greek tradition which says that proud nakedness is a sign of courage; even of sanctity.  That's why the statues of Greek heroes are shown naked, or in the originals, wearing helmets but holding nothing but their lances.  Bravery requires no covering.  Logic suggests that the actors in this film, to be true to history and tradition, would be both naked and magnificent.  But, present reality being what it is, a film of frank nakedness certainly wouldn't be distributed in this country, and besides, it is virtually inconceivable that an entire cast of perfectly matched fine specimens of masculinity could be found; therefore, we bow to the costumer's decision to clothe the performers in something like leather Speedos, and the animator's decision to use digital techniques to multiply on screen many \\"copies\\" of one or wo archetypes, and to animate them endlessly.  But all this is done with such facility that in only a few seconds of watching the film one is unconscious of the effort to achieve the effects, and engrossed in a forever-engrossing story.  It is the equivalent of doing on tape what Greek sculptors did during the Helenistic age when they carved the famous Altar at Pergamum.  The figures are exagerated and many are naked, details are eliminated, and the emotional and physical exertion of the warriors in their battle dominates one's perception; the marble seems to sweat, to bleed, and we can almost hear screams issuing from some of the faces of the wounded and dying.    There's another version of this story available and for rent; THE THREE HUNDRED SPARTANS.  You can find it at Critics Choice or any number of othe sources.  Although it was made three or four decades ago, it was a well made Hollywood technicolor film and is an excellent and realistic re-enactment of the incident at Thermopalye.  Matter of fact, it migt be of some use to compare the two versions.  If you do you'll see that in this newer but more abstract version, Persia and the Persian King is not shown as a real or historic indiidual, but rather as a symbolic figure on a rich and fantastic catafalque who represents not the king, but tyrany and slavery and abject surrender, for to the Spartans the warriors of the King are seen as slaves.  And the Spartans distinguish themselves as free men who will never surrender themselves or allow themselves to be enslaved.  Of course its done with a kind of confrontation of physiques as one might see it in a wrestling ring, when a big baddie associated in name and style with death and perversity, confronts a clean or at least cleaner cut athlete who fights honorably and represents all the cheering audience thinks of as good and worthy, wihin themselves.    To get an idea of the story is easy enough: many commentators have described it in detail, so there's no need for me to go into it here.  There are not many characters, for the plot is lean.  Thre's a heroine, a villanous traitor on the front and another in the Spartan council chamber.  But, nothing described by anybody here can adequately convey the power of the story; its effect is electric and rousing beyond almost anything you can imagine.  Irrational though it may be, it is as though some part of Leonidas' courage manages to get itself itno your bloodstream and there to mingle with your hormones and genes in such a way as to nullify all the petty slights, insults and compromises we undergo every day, and to allow us to touch the fuel source of the flame of manhood that burns within us all.  It is a celebration:  At a time of so many ignoble compromises, a triumph.  Call it a seance, if you like.  Or a testosterone high.  Or think of it as the pep talk of a great coach in the smelly locker room of conflict.  Call on your memories of General Patton and imagine why his army held him in such high esteem.  Or, if you like, consider it a specific against the endlessly onanistic Politically Correct bilious whining of those who don't either respect themselves or like men, and who hate raising boys.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Obviously this film is open to criticism on several fronts.  The fact that it was shot in a shopping center gives it a contemporary commercial feel rather than a futuristic feel.  The gas torches that are supposed to be laser guns are not convincing at all.  Even as a kid watching this film I couldn't figure out what the special effects people were thinking.  They certainly could have come up with a more convincing laser gun than that in 1976.  Also, the dialogue in the script is rather simple and drags in much of the film.  However, having said all of this I still can't help feeling that this is a rather profound film.    Like most pre-Star Wars science fiction, the themes that the film deals with, and deals with well, are themes that we deal with today.  Themes such as:    1)our youth worshipping culture and our horror of growing old  2)our obsession with cosmetics and plastic surgery  3)our limited resources and how they can best be used  4)free love and sex  5)recreational drug use  6)our increasing dependence on technology  7)the deterioration and decline of the family    All of these issues are addressed by the film and dealt with in a sober and unsettling way.  In some ways this is not a fun film to watch.  It raises questions.  Could we actually get to a point where we start killing people just because they reach a certain age?  I've heard some bad things are taking place in Holland and parts of Scandinavia.  Could we ever reach a point where marriage and family life becomes a thing of the distant past, recalled only in legends and folk-lore?  We seem to be moving in that direction.  And could we get to a point where we become totally dependent on technology so that computers are ordering us around and we have no individual rights?  I still think the most chilling part of the film is when the computer says to Logan \\"Identify\\".    The film does present a \\"solution\\" to these issues although I'm not sure that it's a very good one.  It seems to suggest that going back to a more primitive existence where technology didn't exist and where humans are forced to spend their time hunting and looking for nuts and seeds is the answer.  I'm not so sure.    Of course, these are the broad themes that the film addresses but the storyline itself is rather puzzling too.  For example, what was Logan's real motive in running?  Was he following orders from the computer or was he actually running in earnest?  Or was he conflicted about whether he should actually run or stick to the mission?  Also, why, when he was about to meet the other runners for the first time, did he send a tracking signal to the other sandmen?  Did he think that the runners would kill him and that his only hope of escape was for the sandmen to create a diversion?  How did Logan come to the conclusion that sanctuary didn't exist and why did this cause the city's computer system to crash?  These are questions that I've wondered about and I haven't really found a satisfactory answer to them.    I know a lot has been said about the dullness of the dialogue in the film, but I think it's important to remember that this is a young culture that's being presented.  It's a culture where young people don't have to think because the computers do all of their thinking for them and provide for their every need.  In light of this, it's quite probable that their life skills and their intellectual development would be stunted.  These are people who are intellectually more like children than adults.    I do wonder why the city's central computer spoke with a warm, soft feminine voice.  Is this another theme?  It's like a human government saying to it's citizens \\"Let me take care of you.  Let me provide for you. And in return you will be my slaves.\\"
0452289963|1.0|I hate, hate, hate that I wasted even just a few hours of my life reading this book! He's an elitist who talks in circles and doesn't really share anything of value. You're better off looking elsewhere for enlightenment!
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I read almost all opinions and felt that I also have to join one of the goups or share my own impressions.     I was looking forward and going to buy this product for the DTS versions, not the stereo ones. I agree with people saying that the 94' version remasters are good enough as stereo mixes, and I also found the new stereo mixes unsatisfactory. Not because the instrument mix has changed, that is okay, may be exciting and interesting in many ways, but the mastering and the whole soundscape became - for my ears and in my default amplifier settings - too high and somehow bothering.    But the DTS is perfect and brought a brand new Genesis expreience for me, something I wouldn't even dream of before. Of course this new approach needs redefining the instrument levels as there is much more space for everything, making it easier to give priority to everything without becoming messy. This job was done at a great level.    I love the 5.1 mixes and it brings us back to old times when the listening of an LP was a ceremony. Because to have the real 5.1 experience you will have to stay in the middle of the room for the entire lenght of the albums. This is a sort of a last chance to listen to these albums in a way that they were originally inteded to be listened to. In the ear of mp3's...

0316779237|3.0|\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" save this one. Sedaris is at his best telling tales (tall or otherwise) of his own life and family. I like the satirical stories less. Still, it is David Sedaris after all... which means you'll no doubt laugh and enjoy yourself.
0545128285|5.0|I absolutely loved The Tales of Beedle the Bard! I especailly appreciated Dumbledore's afterword on all five of them. They gave some really great background information not only about the stories, but about the wizarding world itself. For example, I've been wanting to know the difference between a warlock and a wizard for years! (Go buy the book to find out.) This is a great read for Harry Potter fans like me, and it supports a good cause.
1401322425|5.0|In Jamie At Home, Jamie Oliver has collected a wonderful selection of fun, tasty, easy-to-make recipes.  If you get a chance to watch his Food Network show of the same name he usually bangs together two or three of the recipes per show, giving a good overview of his techniques.  I've learned some simple time-saving shortcuts from him that make my experience in the kitchen even more enjoyable.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've caught Jillian Michaels on The Biggest Loser and I was curious to learn how one of her workouts would go.  I mean, look at what she's done with all those biggest losers.  So, I bought the tape and love it.  She's great at keeping me motivated and on task.  She's also very honest, reminding me how I have to work hard to get results.  The workout moves are very basic with jumping jacks, lunges, punches, ab work but definitely the most effective workout I've had in a long time because it's been two days and I'm still soar.  Also, the fact that the workout is only 20 minutes makes it easier for me to make the time for it.  I would recommend this video to beginners and advanced alike.  It's got three levels depending on your stamina/ability--they are all great.
B001EOQWFI|4.0|Wonderful movie to watch. The story might have been a little weak but it was a visual masterpiece. Very entertaining. I wish I could have seen it in theaters.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|The Dark Knight starring Christian Bale is pretty exciting but the hype doesn't live up to my chargin. Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise! I'm glad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better actress by far. The opening scene is probably the best sequence, the ending is a bit of a letdown. Entertaining action flick but has its flaws.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|It seems absurd that anyone should need to write a review of an Enya album, since regardless of what one writes the product will sell millions of copies -- but it is worth noting that once again the three individuals -- composer/performer, lyricist, and producer -- have achieved the magic!  There is no Loxion to this album, no Gaelic or Latin (at least not at first).  If this makes the lyrics immediately accessible it still takes a listen or two to wrap one's head around all the music.  Once this happens it is impossible to let go.    One of the nice things about having purchased the album through Amazon -- in my case more a matter of laziness as there are few stores in the isolated area where I live -- was the surprise email that invited one to download an extra free song.  This one, O Miraculum, was truly miraculous.  Though set to a tune already on the album, the lyrics had nothing to do with Winter.  Instead, they celebrated the marvelous journey taken by the Enya troika these past twenty years since Orinoco Flow.  A journey under sky, moon, and stars aoross uncharted waters continues.  O Miraculum.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  It's one of the best CDs I've purchased in years.  Love every song except #10 by Rob.  Just not my favorite.  Everything else rocks!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This is a excellent new album by Pink.  My favorite tracks are the dance hits \\"So What\\" and \\"Funhouse\\".  These tracks are upbeat and fun. Pink shows her softer side on \\"I Don't Believe You\\" and \\"Crystal Ball\\".  \\"Glitter In The Air\\" is a lovely song.  The piano playing on this track is beautiful.  I also like the song \\"Mean\\".  Pink sings about her marriage that did not work out on this song.  She expresses her frustration about her marriage on the song \\"It's All Your Fault\\". This song really rocks.  I love it. I really like the beat of the track \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\".  Pink is not afraid to express how she feels on this CD.  It really shows in her music.  Every track is good on this disc.  I really enjoy it.
0143112724|2.0|I need a resource, not a coffee table book.  The font is hard to read.  The pictures do not seem to make sense with the content, and it is hard to find the rule you need.  Grrr.<br /><br />If they are going to jazz this gem up, they need to remember that we *use* this book.  The artwork should complement and aid the understanding, not confuse the reader.<br /><br />Blah.<br /><br />Why a dog on the cover?  Why????
B0002858YS|5.0|I simply adore this CD. I can't even tell you how many times I've played it over and over. It never gets old. The Killers have become one of my favorite bands and I resent the people that claim they are copycats of U2 or Coldplay. Their sound is unique and fresh. Similarities are inevitable nowadays. Brandon Flowers, the lead- does a wonderful job for every song and you really get a feel for the emotions he presents.    My favorite track-NO DOUBT is 'Mr Brightside'. How can you not love it? It's catchy and though it's upbeat, actually a morose type of song if you carefully listen to the lyrics. Awesome music video too!    'All These Things That I Have Done' is my second favorite track. Great tempo, great melody and the video, if you've seen it-is enjoyable.     Truly, I adore every track on here except #9: Believe me Natalie. I'm not sure why. I think the beginning throws me off every time. But other than that, this album is worth buying just for the replay value. I play it at least once a week in my car alone. Great, great album.
1883217040|5.0|I am very impressed w/ Mr Levine's approach to explaining jazz theory. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading and gaining so much knowledge from the first 100 pages dealing with chord theory and scales, and especially his treatment of melodic minor applications along with diminished and whole-tone harmony. He cuts right through to the chase and lays it on the line -- it's like musician talking to musician. I'm elated that a musician-friend suggested I get this book. ...Lefty
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is a wonderful historical fiction novel which intertwines events involving Sarah, a ten-year-old girl in 1942 Paris, to the life of Julia Jarmond, an American journalist, in 2002. This story centers around the holocaust roundup that took place in Paris during World War II, and includes events and surprising connections that will keep you spellbound. This book is a mezmerizing page-turner and one of the best historical fiction novels of 2008.
B001EHS3WA|5.0|I suffered through almost an entire semester before discovering Andy Field's textbook and accompanying web site, [...]  What I have found has not only made me enjoy learning about the subject, it makes me want to teach statistics one day - because he has shown me how it can be done so well!    Andy has a funny, engaging writing style that keeps you interested through the text.  He breaks complex concepts down into easy, digestible chunks, and is more concerned with producing information in a format that students can use.  Material is differentiated into easy, medium, and difficult levels - there is even a section of each chapter geared to students who are cramming desperately for a final.  SPSS function and output is explained as well.    Also, his is the first statistics textbook I have ever seen that creates examples around the \\"beer goggles\\" effect (how people become more attractive the more alcohol you consume) or whether elves or reindeer are capable of discovering the better santa!  The book is an educational as it is entertaining, and I wish I had not wasted any money on the \\"well-respected\\" stats text my prof told us all to buy.  The concepts are the same no matter what text you use, but this one will explain them in an informative and engaging way.  I would absolutely buy this book if you are at all discouraged or demoralized by statistics, as Andy Field's approach will completely turn it around - it did for me.
0887307280|5.0|My brother recommended this book to me.  I was sceptical at first, however after getting into it there are some really good \\"nuggets\\" of information here.  The story line with the example small biz owner was OK for me, but for others it may not like it.  I did get some great insight and food for thought here.  Has made me really rethink how my small business runs. Am planning on using many of the ideas to make my business better.  Highly recommend.
0385340990|3.0|This book was our book club selection.  Of the six of us, three really liked the book. The other three of us liked the book until about 2/3's through when it took a turn from history to romance.  At that point, we found it predictable and too light.  We think the authors would have done better to have left the narrator's love life out of the book.  We would put it into the category of \\"light read\\" or \\"beach reading.\\"
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack.  Even if you didn't like the movie or don't read the books this soundtrack combines a lot of different artists to make a unique sounding cd.  It's my favorite cd right now and I've listened to it over like 100 times.  I'm sure you would like it :)!
089898890X|5.0|The most multifarious jazz book i have seen so far. Many professional drummers have recommended this book for me and i have seen some of it earlier, but now i ordered this for myself to be able to take through these parts more elaborated way.
B000HT386M|5.0|I love Adam Sandler movies and this was probably the best movie of his I had seen so far!  It wasn't one of the 75% stupid, 25% funny movies of his I love so much, but a really really good movie!  You HAVE to watch it!
0882847953|5.0|This book is father of other drum books we have today. People interested in jazz, this is must be book for them, but not only for jazz players.   Basic is triple feel syncopation. You can comp with snare drum or bass drum or mixed, also can practice triplets on snare, accenting syncopation on toms etc, no limits besides your fantasy.  I sometimes use syncopation also as straight feel, playing beat with hands (snare 2-nd and 4-th), bass drum plays syncopation, or hi hat playing syncopation, this is little Gary Chester \\"New Breed\\" theme already.   One more musical way to use syncopation is for example to take 12 bars syncopation, write blues harmony on it and whole band plays the 12 bar syncopation rhythm.. I have used this in some blues pieces.  Important book for me.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|I love the Theme song.  Despite what a number of people think.  The rest of the Soundtrack is enjoyable.  Not the best but still entertaining.
0783240287|5.0|The classic tale of Joseph and his coat of many colors as envisioned by one of the leading innovators of musical theatre, Andrew Lloyd Webber.  With music by Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice (Aladdin and The Lion King), the songs are so catchy you will be singing them for days afterward.  The entire movie is one long operetta-style musical (aka.  No stopping for just talking.)  The songs range from ballad to rock-n-roll to Calypso.  Wonderful costumes, phenominal acting and great sets make for a fantastic visual extravaganza.  No CGI here.  This is all live.  Osmond conjours up a superb portrayal of Joseph, Jacob's most beloved son, all the way from his youth through to adulthood.  With a star-studded cast this movie is one to keep for the next generation and the next.  Dream on, Joseph; dream on!
B001GQACGO|4.0|After my disappointment in her last album, B'Day, I wasn't excited to purchase her next. I felt like the direction of her music was turning into nothing but club music. I felt the highlights on her B-Day album were ballads like \\"Resentment\\" and \\"Listen\\". I didn't like the fact that the majority of the album consisted of energetic club tracks. I wanted more emotion and more ballads. When I heard \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\" for the first time, it only helped add fuel to my fear that her next album would be just like B'Day. However, a friend of mine told me \\"No, you have to hear 'If I Were A Boy', you'll like it\\". I brushed it off like \\"whatever\\", but then I heard the song and was amazed. It was by far the best single she'd ever released. After hearing that her album would be a double disc, with one full of nothing but ballads, I felt I'd give it a try. I was content knowing that disc two maybe something I never even bother getting into.     After hearing disc one of the album, I was simply amazed. I wasn't expecting the sound of the disc to be as mature as it was. I feel in love with every single track. My personal favorite is \\"Smash Into You\\". \\"Disappear\\" and \\"Broken Hearted Girl\\" follow next on the list.     Disc two wasn't as bad as it could have been. Songs like \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" just made me roll my eyes, shake my head, and skip to the next song. But I did find some tracks that I like a lot. \\"Radio\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" are great upbeat songs that are still musically complex, unlike the majority of \\"club songs\\" today. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" has a dark sound to it which I like. I also like \\"Scared of Lonely\\", a passionate sped-up ballad a little too upbeat to make it onto disc one. Basically, the only songs on the album is can criticize are \\"Single Ladies\\", \\"Diva\\", and \\"Video Phone\\". With the exception of those tracks, Beyonce's got a great album here.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|No complaints on quality, looks great. Can't have a classic Noir in standard crummy DVD anymore so the upgrade is very much so worth it. Anyone who wants to complain can have my old VHS tape if they like.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I recently bought Enya's latest Cd \\"And Winter Came. I love to turn it up and listen to it.  The music has a way of letting you forget what might be going on in the world. My husband and I often go to sleep listening to her soft voice and beautiful music. I can't wait till she makes another CD.
B0000636NQ|5.0|In 1968 I had no interest in this album, but always admired TYA. I discovered this album through Pandora Radio. I bought it on iTunes and enjoyed it for several months before a hard drive crash (I had moved and not recently backed up my music), so I bought it from Amazon, but lo and behold it was the 2002 version, which had more songs and it was polished as well. What a gem this turned out to be. Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons, Ric Lee and Chick Churchill never sounded better.
0316017922|5.0|The thesis of this book is simple: Success equals the luck of being born at the right moment in the right place.     I've read his other books and found them interesting and recommended them to my students. This book, however, touched me personally. I was incredibly moved by the final chapters. This book is a must read.    The information contained within is nothing new. Like his other books, he piggybacks off of the research that other people have done. He treks the reader across familiar intellectual terrain like self-fulfilling prophecy effects, Hofstede's dimensions, Albion's Seed, social/cultural capital, linguistic relativism, and white privilege, to name a few sights. And, like his other books, Gladwell is a masterful storyteller in Outlier.     But there is also a deeper meaning in this book. It is a gem.  The final chapters of the book were unexpected, and brilliant. The book, as is its author, is a total outlier.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie from Studio Ghibli. Nausicaa is one of my favorite main character and she travels using one of my favorite flying machine, mehve, which is known as a glider. A fox-squarrel, named Teto, is a very cool \\"pet\\" that I like to call it since Teto is a friend of Nausicaa. Nausicaa cares for the environment and the laws of nature. During the flashback, I love the child singing, which is quite silly to my mind, but I don't let that get to me. However, after I watched the entire movie, my mind still wanted to listen to that sing over and over again. It's just hauntingly beautiful!!! So, during the time when I still have that movie rented from Netflix, I kept watching it again and again the next two days from when I watched. Thus, I was having a hard time mailing the movie back to Netflix, so I bought the movie. Ohmu, a friend of Nausicaa, cares for her at the end of the movie. Hayao Mazaiki (don't know the correct spelling) did a great job with the movie!!! I enjoyed the music and this really helps tell the story of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind! It just matches perfectly with the scene the director intended.<br /><br />I'd like to thank Disney for not including the introduction as part of the movie when the movie watcher selects \\"Play Movie.\\" In my opinion, it's probably just a spoiler.<br /><br />I watched the movie in Japanese version and the motions that the director intended to convey is not lost: if you select the Japanese as the soundtrack and enable the English subtitle (not the \\"English for the hearing impaired,\\" as the dialog can be a bit different), you can watch this movie and still read the captions. This is even if you don't know Japanese.<br /><br />Personally, I like Japanese version of the soundtrack because I like it with less voicing, but that does not matter. In comparison to other movies: Castle in the Sky's English soundtrack has much more voicing than the Japanese soundtrack, which I do like the Japanese version better. If there's one character's voice I like in the English version of Nausicaa of the Valle of the Wind, it will be Lord Yupa. But that doesn't mean Lord Ypa's voice in Japanese needs to be improved, since the movie has originally been released around 1982, which is the year of when I was born. Choosing a voice for a character is very important, in my opinion, so I like the teenager's voice for Asbel in Japanese version of the movie better than the sound of an adult in the English version. I can easily say the same for Castle in the Sky, but this movie is no big deal.<br /><br />Will I watch this movie again? Sure I would! I love this movie a lot because-- well, it's excellent!!! I watched the movie in a 57\\" HDTV with my home theater system, and it's amazing looking at Nausicaa in the main DVD memu.racter's voice I like in the English version of Nausicaa of the Valle of the Wind, it will be Lord Yupa.

I am left wanting something more in identifying underlying beliefs (follow your feelings at times is the best advice I have gotten for that) and how to construct better ones. BeliefWorks by Ray Dodd helped a bit with that.
B001DHXT20|4.0|In the summer of 2008, two superhero adaptations ruled the box office: Iron Man, and the Dark Knight. Released in May, Iron Man was something of a surprise hit, with perpetual rehabber (and then-b-lister) Robert Downey Jr. turning a fantastic performance as Tony Stark, playboy and armored hero. On the other hand, the Dark Knight (released in July) was the most anticipated movie of the summer and its success was neither surprising nor undeserved. (I do think they took the \\"dark\\" part of the title a bit too seriously but it's still an excellent movie.) These movies left little room in the public's awareness for a third superhero movie, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" (TIH), which debuted just a few weeks prior to the Dark Knight. TIH did well at the box office, but nothing like the stellar numbers attained by the other two movies. This is unfortunate, because it's an excellent movie.<br /><br />Aside from the timing of the release, a couple of other factors left TIH at a bit of disadvantage. First and foremost, Ang Lee's \\"The Hulk\\", rightly pilloried as a leaden, quasi-freudian waste of time, left moviegoers with something of a bad taste regarding this particular character. Second, TIH was directed by the Frenchmen Louis Leterriere, whose prior work (Transporter 2, Danny the Dog) did not suggest that we should have high expectations. Those aren't horrible movies...okay, danny the dog was horrible... Anyway, \\"Who cares about the director?\\" you may ask. Well, look at the recent history of superhero movies and you will find that most of them have B-list or low A-list stars, but are helmed by critically-acclaimed directors.<br /><br />Batman: Time Burton directed the first two. Michael Shumacher, who wrecked the franchise, was no slouch, with movies like \\"The Lost Boys\\" and \\"The Client\\" under his belt. Christopher Nolan, who revived it, made his name directing the acclaimed, cult indie hit \\"Memento\\". Neither Michael Keaton nor Christian Bale were household names as actors (perhapsKeaton could be called well-known at the time, but he was famous for comedy, and his casting as Batman was a bit unexpected).<br /><br />Spider-Man: Tobey Maguire? Household name? No. Sam Raimi lacked the critical approval of the batman directors, but he was well-established as a creative force, mostly for the evil dead/army of darkness movies.<br /><br />X-Men 1&2/Superman Returns: Hugh Jackman was not famous BEFORE X-Men, but Bryan Singer (the director) was, for \\"The Usual Suspects\\". X-Men features some well-known actors, but who (aside from trekkies and RSC fans) would see a movie because it features Ian McKellan or Patrick Stewart. Singer directed the first two X-Men films, then cast unknown Brandon Routh (Brandon Routh), in his well-intended but over-long attempt to resuscitate Superman.<br /><br />I already mentioned Ang Lee's mangling of \\"The Hulk\\", but Mr. Lee was (and still is) a great director, and landing him for that movie was seen at the time as a real coup.<br /><br />The list goes on, but I will stop there.  Suffice it to say, getting a respected director has been standard to the recent formula for making superhero movies. They lend comic book movie projects an aura of cultural legitimacy.<br /><br />Well, TIH departs from that template, and guess what? It works. First, unlike other superhero movies, this one really revolves around the guy playing the hero--in this case, Edward Norton. Norton is one of the (if not THE) best actors of his generation. From his breakout in \\"Primal Fear\\", to the haunting \\"American History X\\", \\"Fight Club\\", and the more recent \\"The Painted Veil\\", it's clear this guy has chops as an actor. Critics love him. He is active in social enterprise, and he's done some admirable work in writing and production, as well (\\"Frida\\"). Indeed, without Norton's involvement, TIH never would have been made. So in this case, it's the actor who brings the legitimacy, and he picks a director who won't mess around with the deeper meaning and motivations of the character, but will simply tell the story.<br /><br />And Leterriere is up to the task. He may not be Ingmar Bergman, but he has a nice, taut script to work with, and he definitely knows how to direct action sequences. Indeed, whereas many recent superhero movies have tested audiences bladders with 2 1/2 hour runtimes (don't tell me you didn't think the Dark Knight was going to end sooner than it did), TIH clocks in at just under two hours, and it never drags. We get the exposition of the origins of the hulk in a clever montage sequence that is clearly derivative of the opening of the original Bixby/Ferrgino Hulk TV series. By the end of the opening credits, the movie has established: 1) How Bruce Banner became the Hulk (note--avoid using self as subject in radiation experiments); 2) Where Bruce Banner is and what he is doing. (I love it when movies use a variety of expository tools--text, dialogue, images--to explain something in an efficient manner. The Tony Stark power-point at the beginning of Iron Man is another example.) TIH does in 3 minutes what Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" failed to do in over two hours.<br /><br />Leterriere and Norton also understand the key to dramatic tension for Hulk stories (disclaimer--I loved the comic when I was a kid): it's not what happens once he becomes the Hulk that is really interesting, it's what happens BEFORE that matters. All of the tension and suspense comes from the events leading up to the transformation. Sure, the Hulk's violence is spectacular, and there are some great moments (\\"Hulk Smash!\\"), but you're paying the most attention to the movie when Banner is struggling to contain this awful beast that lurks within him. He has no idea what he will do if he becomes the Hulk, and he does everything he can to avoid the metamorphosis. Here is where Norton gives the movie its dramatic center. He is convincing in his abhorrence of this thing, and his obsession with getting rid of it. Banner's lone aim is to cure himself,but events transpire to make that very difficult. That is the essential story of the Hulk, and it's rather atypical for a superhero. Most heros want to do good, beat the bad guys, etc. Banner just wants to be normal, and the government and villains won't leave him alone, dragging him again and again into situations where he cannot avoid terrible violence. The movie sticks to this simple plot, to good effect.<br /><br />The Hulk's antics are entertaining, and the final showdown between the Hulk and his even hulkier (though not green) adversary is exciting. I am inclined to agree with other reviewers who complain that the Hulk still looks a bit cartoonish, though it is a major improvement over the previous movie, and they use darkness and shadow to good effect. He is most life-like when you don't see his face well.<br /><br />Norton is supported by a strong cast, notably William Hurt as the general and Tim Roth as a very nasty little (and later, big) soldier. I have never been fond of Liv Tyler, but one thing she definitely has going for her is that she's not Kirsten Dunst. (I must have missed the meeting when they decided that Dunst is pretty. Come on... she has fangs! And don't say I am cruel. If the character you play is supposed to be a model, you should be believable as a model.)<br /><br />This really is an excellent movie. I highly recommend it to anyone fond of comic book adaptations or action movies. For people with younger kids, it's one of the more family-friendly of the recent crop of superhero movies. The bad language and sex quotient is low. Most of the violence is bloodless--bodies thrown hundreds of feet, but not gory. Indeed, I think the pg-13 rating might be a bit conservative.<br /><br />On the technical side, the digital soundtrack is fabulous, with lots of rumbling bass. If you've got a good surround system, you'll have even more fun with it.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a fanatic when it comes to the \\"Twilight\\" series. So in order to complete my collection I had to get the Twilight Soundtrack. If I could pick one word to describe the soundtrack it would be \\"amazing.\\" I loved just about every track on the CD. If you're an avid Twilight lover- and even if your not-add this CD to your collection. My favorite song on the soundtrack is \\"Eyes of Fire\\" by Blue Foundation. Finally, the soundtrack has great music along with the appeal of Twilight. It even came with a poster (which is hanging on my wall at this very moment.)A two-for-one special! What more could you ask for?

0307388840|5.0|_Atonement_ is a fine book, highly reminiscent of Elizabeth Bowen's work. But I don't understand why the common assessment of Briony as unreliable narrator seems to stop at her end-revelation that Cecilia and Robbie were killed without ever fulfilling their love.<br /><br />Briony admits, in fact, to being a novelist throughout. She says she collapsed several hospitals she worked at into one. A common writing technique; after all, what is important is how her experience as a wartime nurse affects her.<br /><br />Her rejection letter, which states that Elizabeth Bowen (who was said to not even work for the magazine) felt compelled to read her manuscript and loved it, is far too glowing for reality. Then there is the book's harmonious ending. Several generations of Briony's relatives assemble to see Briony's childhood play \\"The Trials of Arabella,\\" which was interrupted and upstaged by the drama of Lola's sexual violation. Her cousin Pierrot ran away from rehearsals as a child, scotching the performance. Yet the final chapter of _Atonement_ asserts he was bitterly disappointed at not acting in it. To the extent that decades later he organized this performance, and is tearfully grateful to see it. This is pure wish fulfillment. Briony is giving herself a happy ending that she did not give Robbie and Cecilia--though she's still contemplating the latter.<br /><br />Much more interesting is the description of the central event, Lola's sexual violation. Fifteen-year-old Lola is socially sophisticated--her mother just publicly eloped to Paris with a lover. Lola dresses and acts as much like an adult as she can. She's very pretty, dresses attractively, and her grooming and makeup are impeccable. Her interaction with the wealthy young chocolate magnate Paul Marshall is distinctly flirtatious. Like other girls of her generation, Lola would have been brought up to marry well, and Paul is an excellent catch. In another two or three years, Lola would be brought out into society,where her pursuit of a husband would be entirely acceptable.<br /><br />While Briony is  helping everyone to hunt for her runaway twin cousins, she checks the 18th-century \\"ruined villa\\" on an little island in the little lake. A spot that is both romantic, and easy for non-residents to locate (Paul Marshall has never visited the house before). Here she discovers Lola with a man on top of her, and immediately assumes this is a rape. Three years later, when Lola marries Paul Marshall, Briony admits the man was Paul. However, Briony, who her sister Cecilia describes as \\"a young thirteen,\\" is not at the time sophisticated enough to understand the difference between consensual sex and rape. Only a few hours earlier, Briony discovered Cecilia and Robbie having enthusiastic sex in the library, assumed it was rape, and they have not had an opportunity to tell her otherwise. Very possibly Lola's sexual act is also quite willing, and Briony realizes that when she is somewhat older. Even Briony marvels that Lola \\"fell in love with her rapist.\\"<br /><br />When Briony discovers Lola and Paul, Paul immediately flees, leaving Lola to deal with the problems. And they have several.  If it's consensual sex, Lola's aunt, uncle, and parents will be furious at her for losing her virtue. They'll be even more angry at Paul, who is a responsible adult. Paul can't immediately marry Lola to repair the damage--she's so young that \\"people would talk.\\" Also, Lola's uncle (Briony's father) works for the War Ministry, and Paul is angling for a very lucrative army-provisioning contract. It's likely that Lola's uncle could make sure he didn't get it.<br /><br />And here, Lola gets lucky:  Briony, carefully led on, is willing to help Lola call the event a rape and to pin the blame on Robbie. Paul Marshall may merely have had a little sexual amusement in mind. But now that they've been seen, Lola could blackmail Paul into marrying her as soon as she's of age, by threatening to reveal the truth. Everything works out for them.  Lola gets her wealthy husband and hangs onto him for the rest of her life. Paul gains his army contract. He also marries a woman whom he was attracted to when she was 15 and who is even prettier at 18.<br /><br />I suspect that close examination of _Atonement_ would reveal additional examples of Briony as an unreliable narrator.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Let's get one thing straight - I'm not a music critic, I'm just somebody who knows what they like, and I like this.  A lot.  My sister originally introduced me to Nickleback: I bought 'Silver Side Up' on her recommendation and have been hooked ever since.  No subsequent purchase has been a disappointment, and 'Dark Horse' is no exception.  There are no surprises, no deviating from the addictive Nickleback formula (heavy guitar, thunderous drums and complex lyrics), just good, good music.      But don't take my word for it: stick this album on and TURN IT UP!  It's great for bad moods...

Mr. Bonner displays a grounded technical understanding of anatomy and movement, then pairs that with mythology, some grotesquerie, and implied narratives. I literally cannot imagine who would be disappointed by this book.

There are so many delightful moments in this film that intertwine into its brilliance that I never once thought \\"eh, kid's movie moment.\\" The attention grabbing use of sound and visuals (the rocket lift-off was so flawless it felt like you were watching NASA stock footage) often make you forget you're viewing computer generated images, and the all-ages love story between two mis-matched characters is impossible to resist. (I kept thinking of [[ASIN:B000B8QG4A Lady and the Tramp]] as Wall-E trotted Eve through the rotted remains of the city to the sounds of show tunes.)<br /><br />Wall-E himself is a direct descendant of R2D2, [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial]] and the one from [[ASIN:B0014WAC3I Short Circuit]]. He's a box of rust and bolts that you just want to squeeze and hug. He's all alone in a mess of someone else's making. Yet when the sleek and distinctly female Eve arrives, well, he is smitten and just wants to hold whatever passes for her hand. Except she is a probe, sent from the old colonists to see if the Wall-E's from centuries back have cleaned up enough to make the planet inhabitable.<br /><br />The messages are multi-layered throughout \\"Wall-E.\\" The Planet needs to be taken care of. Some things are worth the wait. You don't always need to listen to the corporations. (Gee, funny how true that came to be 4 months after he movie came out.) You also need to take care of yourself and pay attention to the people around you. The fact that the simple little clean-up droid brought The Axiom's otherwise oblivious passengers together is an even greater message than the environmental one.<br /><br />There are - as with most Pixar films - a variety of nods to other films. You'll see tips of the cap to [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey]], [[ASIN:B000VS6R26 Titanic]], as well as self-references to Pixar's [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story]] and [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]]. Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the computer is a nice touch as well. The song from Peter Gabriel is one of the best he's done in years. There is so much imagination here and yet \\"Wall-E\\" never trips over its own cleverness. There's not much else to say other than this was one of the year's best movies.

B000RHFZ9C|5.0|Up until ABBEY ROAD, there were seperate mixes for all BEATLE tracks -- one in mono, and another in stereo. The Beatles normally would sit in on the mono mixes, and leave the stereo versions to George Martin and crew. There are many marked differences between the two versions of this classic album, most notibly during the finale of GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, SGT. PEPPER REPRISE and A DAY IN THE LIFE. If you are a student of the stereo version, you will easily pick out all of the changes. A very interesting listen, and quite a rare piece of vinyl to boot.
B001HXG8PK|4.0|When I saw the 2 disc special edition coming out, I had to get it. Despite the fact that I already bought the limited edtion... They could've done so much more to this rather then putting it in a big book format with screen shots from the movie and credits. The discs are placed on the inside of the front and back cover in a padded like holder with a white sheet of paper to separate the CDs and pages to prevent damage or marking I suppose.    Some of the pictures I like, most of them I don't care for. I would've gladly just pay $25 for the 2-disc CD size casing with a small booklet of pictures and info. Unreleased tracks are placed in the 2nd CD with 4 bonus remixes.    So if you're an avid music collector, fan of the composers/music or fanboy of Batman. Get this if you got the money. Otherwise don't bother.     P.S.  If you're wondering where the track list is, it's on the 4th page.

0060926317|1.0|I recently checked this book on tape out of our local library, listening intently as I drove through the countryside.    Seemingly implausible at the start, I found myself taken in by the message of \\"the real people\\" who live off the land, healing with plants, using senses other than the commonly known five in order to make their way through the outback of Australia ..... and on and on.  Indeed, it is a fantastic tale.    However, the last line of the edition to which I listened summed up the entire book for me as far as the \\"truth or fiction\\" question is concerned.  The very final words are that the author had learned to use (among other things) the \\"magic of illusion.\\"  In the instant that I heard those words I realized the author had just described the nature of her writing.  One hundred percent illusion.    A poorly written, fantastic tale?  Yes.  An illusion?  Even moreso!

B001C3KCSY|4.0|It is safe to say that Kings of Leon \\"bring the heat\\" on their fourth LP, ONLY BY THE NIGHT.  The band sounds `tight' and the popularity in the U.S. of the band which has already achieved acclaim in Europe is finally growing.  The soloing is top-rate and the timbre (sound) of the band is awesome; this band could truly be the next big thing.  One thing is for sure, the Followill boys surely should be proud of themselves with this brilliant addition to anybody's collection.<br /><br />The album opens both mysteriously and brilliantly with \\"Closer\\".  While Kings of Leon ultimately chose \\"Sex on Fire\\" as their first single, \\"Closer\\" with its catchy hook and its inherent southern rock vintage sound would have made an awesome first single as well. Instantly, the listener knows they are taking part of an epic adventure throughout ONLY BY THE NIGHT.<br /><br />The Kings play with distortion against a sick drum groove on the equally alluring \\"Crawl\\".  Here, the souped-up sound of Kings of Leon would make anybody bob their head.  The songwriting is top-notch and Followill's vocals are well nuanced with a great bluesy inflection.  Again, \\"Crawl\\" would have been an equally capable first single.<br /><br />\\"Sex on Fire\\", the great first single, is by far the definitive track of ONLY BY THE NIGHT.  It is easy to see why this track is a Grammy Nominee. Followill has never sounded better and the songwriting seems to come over as extremely authentic here.<br /><br />\\"Use Somebody\\" continues a string of hits, hence thrusting the momentum of ONLY BY THE NIGHT to loftier heights.  \\"Manhattan\\" has a more \\"chill\\", lighter feel than the previous four tracks.  Even so, Followill howls and screams with all his brilliant vocal inflections in such a refined manner that it would make Lynyrd Skynyrd proud to hear a band like Kings of Leon keeping the ideals of southern rock alive so brilliantly. \\"Manhattan\\" is clearly one of my favorite tracks from ONLY BY THE NIGHT.<br /><br />\\"Revelry\\" is solid and enjoyable as well, if a shade less enthralling than the previous five tracks.  Even taking a hit in quality (a slight one at that), the background vocals are lovely and the music made by the band is phenomenal.  \\"17\\" has a `symphonic' southern rock introduction that instantly grabs the listener's attention.  Followill's vocal falsetto here is lovely and the fills where the vocal lines break make this rock feel truly authentic.  That's the thing with a band like Kings of Leon - you can just hear and tell there is a certain authenticity and devotion that not all bands have.  There's a distinct \\"it\\" factor.<br /><br />\\"Notion\\" keeps within southern Rock spirit (I even hear a touch of piano) with yet another solid track. \\"I Want You\\" is solid, if a little less enthralling than the very, very best.  Again, the atmosphere that the band creates musically is always on-point, even on a slower, more relaxed tune like the lengthy \\"I Want You\\".  \\"Be Somebody\\" isn't bad, but falls slightly short of the quality of the forefront of the album.  Closing track \\"Cold Desert\\" starts out piano and constantly crescendos in.  This track is a bit slower and more subdued, not totally unlike \\"I Want You\\".  Followill vocals sit atop the subtleness of the arrangement making for quite a fine listening experience to send off one of 2008's greatest rock albums.<br /><br />Essentially, I highly recommend Kings of Leons' ONLY BY THE NIGHT to all rock fans, no matter what your preference.  This is one of the years very best rock efforts and highly deserving of a Grammy award (even if they are going against the ubiquitous Coldplay and Metallica's critically lauded DEATH MAGNETIC).

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is basically my favorite superhero movie to date and on blu ray it shines nicely.  1st off the picture quality is fantastic switching to different aspect ratios depending on the shot and the sound is awesome.<br /><br />Story wise this movie really made me think like no superhero movie before it even with all that's been out so far.  The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.  The tone of the movie is dark and it hardly ever comes out of that even in the end but there is a little light.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger or his movies but I have to say I think now I am gonna miss him.  I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said \\"Wow\\".  Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time. I did notice that at certain moments though intentional or not when Batman was not Bruce Wayne he talked in this weird throaty voice which I guess might of been intentional but sounded weird.  The movie left me a lot of room to really think about Batmans struggle and the way he handles himself in those situations to either be a hero or slowly turn to being a villain.  The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.  I did like the fact this movie did not have a whole bunch of CG and everything revolved more around the human element and the reasoning of human nature.  Don't get me wrong CG is not bad but this movie had a lot more going for it than pretty effects.  I do wish Two Face had a bigger role and I figured when I heard certain phrases close to the beginning of the movie I figured they would repeat later as some sort of lesson or something.  I found the ending to be relatively weak and kinda came to a quick end after yet another moral choice brought by Two Face.  Though some parts I found predictable this is far by my favorite superhero movie of all time and to great to be missed.predictable this is far by my favorite superhero movie of all time and to great to be missed.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|This movie is fantastic on all fronts- I've seen it 3 times and can't get enough. Seeing it at the IMAX was one of my most fondest summer memories and still is. I made a vow to buy the movie when it got released...<br /><br />...and I did. As much as I love having it on DVD, I was VERY let down by the DVD. The \\"Sounds of Anarchy\\" feature was interesting but it was just about the song \\"Why So Serious?\\", a suite that's 2 notes and runs 9 minutes long. I didn't want to see about like 5 minutes of a cellist playing 2 notes. The batsuit thingy was interesting but way too short. It's nice to have the IMAX scenes, but can't we watch them WITH the movie???? And the Gotham City newscasts... *snore*. Boring!!!<br /><br />So overall, DO buy the movie if you want the movie on DVD, but choose your poison carefully- get the one disc instead. You'll be happier.
B0017M8XS6|3.0|Ignoring all of the rampaging about the sound quality, the versions need explanation instead.  The supposed different versions on the album aren't really different.  Only nugget I found to be interesting was Karn Evil 9 Third Impression backing track where you hear all the moog intricacies along with some added echo.  The rest has been all heard before in some form or another.  The hidden track isn't anything special either.  It's just a few minute mix of regular BSS song snippets where it was probably taken off of a final mix acetate in 1973 where again nothing is revealed or different.
0545128285|5.0|I may have, in some ways, outgrown the Harry Potter series (I was disappointed with how the last two books in the series turned out, but that's just me saying it), but I haven't outgrown my sense of wonder. When I heard about this book, I thought about getting it from the library, but when I heard that the proceeds from the book sales went to help disadvantaged kids, it almost became a matter of conscience -- in a good way! -- to get this book.<br /><br />I'm glad I did! The stories are delightful little fairy tales that will enchant any child or anyone who's a child at heart -- Magical or Muggle alike, and the notes by Dumbledore at the end of each story give us a lot of insight into the Wizarding world. I particularly liked, in the notes for \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\", Rowling's gentle \\"take that\\" swipes at the trend toward \\"dumbed down\\" fairy tales that Andrew Lang started in the 1800s -- and mind you, Rowling does *NOT* dumb down or bowdlerize the Potter-verse, which is one of the things I still like about it: she lets the good guys have their flaws, the bad guys be scary and the darkness be dark so that the light can be seen and valued. I'm glad for the chance to step back into the Potter-verse and I hope that J.K. Rowling will someday grace us with another book like it. My only carp is that there were only a handful of stories, but there's really little to complain about when each story is as delightful as a full-length novel from the Potter-verse.
B00009Z576|4.0|Get Drama.  It's a good album no matter who's on it.  It sheds the skittishness of Tormato and is most certainly better than Big Generator.  Horn's penchant for hooks completely shine here while Downes doesn't get all Asia sugary and sounds more like a Kaye-Wakeman hybrid.  The only Asia-esque song you will hear is White Car which clearly is a blueprint for Asia's Last To Know on Alpha.  There's also some Anderson sung tracks here but I strongly believe they are on this Drama reissue because they were done closer chronologically to Drama than Tormato.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Having seen \\"Mamma Mia!\\" on the big screen and having fallen in love with its energy, musicality, comedy, and joy, in spite of its improbability, I was anxious to see how it would look on the \\"little screen\\" (DVD on home TV). Some films I've loved in the theater just don't look nearly as good on the little screen (for me, e.g., \\"Titanic\\"). So when I stayed at a hotel that offers pay-per-view movies on TV and saw \\"Mamma Mia!\\" among the choices, I ordered it. It looked and sounded GREAT on the little screen! I can hardly wait to have my own copy! Ladies, if the man in your life is such a grouch that he refuses to watch this, or hates it if he does watch it, DUMP HIM.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|this is a sick and disgusting movie that just took great ideas from other movies and mashed it up and added the \\"shock\\" factor. Really?

I kept waiting for a redeeming moment like waking up from a bad dream-- only reason I kept watching. I wasn't waiting for a \\"good\\" ending because that's not always what makes a movie, or even a fairy tale ending.  But when the end hit I was actually mad, strangely enough. I never get irritated from movies? but to have however many hours sucked out of my life only to be suckered in by good cinematography was really irritating.    a 5 year old with a camera and some glue could have made a better movie... I agree that anyone can just copy paste great angles and colors and orchestrate complete trash--exactly what this was. Good composition + Stabbing people - any sort of good plot = good movie?... nope.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I purchased this on a whim because it features a cover of Joni Mitchell's River.  Had never heard or heard of Sarah McLachlan.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  Quelle belle voix!  Often languid, but complex and quirky, too.  Two favorites: 1st: River.  Ms McLachlan wisely chooses to stay close to Joni Mitchell's original.  She conveys well the yearning for the northern winter that is the core of this piece. You too will want to put on your skates and leave commercialism, lost love, and palm trees behind. The only flaw: the final \\"fly\\" is unfortunate - much too bold, loud and long.  2nd: In the Bleak Mid-Winter:  A unique, other-worldly rendition of the carol fashioned from the Christina Rossetti poem.  The only carol I know of that hints, just barely hints, at doubt: \\"Angels and Archangels may have gathered there...\\"  Apparently the angels attending Jesus' birth are not visible and thus unverifiable, and perhaps the Virgin Herself is unaware of their presence.  Buy this album for these two pieces alone and enjoy the rest, too.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Truly a wonderful package with a fantastic film inside. This is one of the best blu-rays available for content, picture quality, and audio quality. If you don't believe me, go to [...] and check it out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys or appreciates animation... any ages. So go out and lay your hands on it.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|What a little treasure of a movie!  This is arguably not just the best animated movie of the year, but possibly simply the best movie of the year.  There is an unabashed love of the essence of cinema, of visual stimulus and sound to tell a story which is rarely seen.  Certainly, rarely imbued with such originality and warmth.  Our little hero is a waste disposal unit, left on an earth which is polluted and trashed, slowly making his way through huge mountains of garbage.  He has evolved a personality since mankind left 700 years ago.. a personality that lets him learn how to hold affection for EVE, a modern sleek robot who arrives one day on a secret mission.  When she returns to space, Wall*E follows and he finds out what has happened to mankind and may even hold the key to changing their path, as he forms a deeper bond with EVE.   The opening scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and detailed - the squeaks and whistles that form Wall*E's voice truly define his personality to the audience, and his antics never fail to draw the viewer in, as he collects artifacts (in a way reminiscent of Ariel in Little Mermaid).  In truth, the most cartoon and unbelievable characters in the movie are the humans, once Wall*E finds them.  That quibble aside, we are left with a movie put together with huge care and attention which delights from beginning to end.  For the cinema buff, there are enough references to classics such as 2001, Silent Running and others to appreciate along the way.  It certainly cannot be overlooked that this is probably the finest animation Pixar has ever achieved.  At times during the first 20 minutes especially, you could almost be watching live action.  But it is not just the quality of craftsmanship of the manufacture of the movie.  Once again, Pixar have created genuine characters - even if they ARE `just' robots, and, crucially, storytelling that really works.  Joyously, the eco-message is never slapped in your face in a moment of sentimentality.  The tightrope between gooey sentimentality and genuine warmth is duly walked, with stunning effect.  All in all, an unmissable movie - if you think you don't like animation, get off your high horse and prepare to be gobsmacked.  If you like Pixar's output already, prepare to see them at their most imaginative.  Simply perfect.

B000LB234Y|4.0|This is a precursor of Robert Kyosaki's \\"Rich Dad\\", John Cummuta's \\"Transforming debt into Weath\\" and other financial intelligence books. John Cummuta have extended this work by explaining the concept of compound interest, while Robert Kyosaki have resolved the issue of \\"live beyond your means\\", advocated by Thomas J. Stanley. The drawback of mr. Stanley is that he doesn't seem to suggest what do with accumulated wealth, and only advocates being prudent and frugal as a lifestyle, e.g. do not buy luxury cars or boats or wear expensive clothing's. Robert Kyosaki have criticized this modest lifestyle and have solved this drawback by clearly defined the distinctions of assets and the liabilities and suggested that luxury cars can be boats should be purchased from yields produced by the assets rather than from cash flows diverted from obtaining assets.    So, the \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" became a classics, while the other authors take the ideas from it without even referencing it.    Thomas J. Stanley have devised the terms \\"Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW)\\", \\"Average Accumulator of Wealth (AAW)\\" and \\"Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW)\\", and concluded that any American PAW household even with very modest income will become millionaire.     The main points of the book are:  Spend Less Than You Earn, Avoid Buying Status Objects or Leading a Status Lifestyle, PAWs Are Willing to Take Financial Risk if it is Worth the Reward and Economic Outpatient Care. The authors also make the interesting observation that UAWs tend to have children who require an influx of their parents' money in order to afford the lifestyle that they expect for themselves, and that they are less likely to have been taught about money, budgeting and investing by their parents.    I would suggest the works by Robert Kyosaki and John Cummuta in addition to this book.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I was so excited to finally get to see \\"Wanted\\".  But as soon as it started I was very uncomfortable.  I am glad I didn't let my daughter watch this....since it starts out with a very explicit sex scene and language that I can do without.  Did they have to use the language with every sentence?  Was the sex scenes really necessary?  The story line was awesome with the betrayal and twist, but would have been so much better without the language and sex.      ANgelina was awesome in her performance as always. At least she didn't disappoint me as the others did.  I wish that the producers and writers could understand that movies can be made and still be successful without all the sex and language.  Others have done it, why can't they?

0141030933|3.0|Pat Barker's REGENERATION trilogy is a fascinating set of books. Barker follows some key British characters during WWI, and she vividly portrays the war's effect on them. In the first of the three novels, poet Siegfried Sassoon arrives at a mental hospital for British officers because he has formally objected to the war, and his friend has him committed for treatment rather than face execution for treason.<br /><br />(Let me just add here, that, if I am ever sent to a Nut Hut, I hope it's like this one: these guys enjoy fine dining and afternoon golf, and they have access to top shelf alcoholic beverages. Huzzah!)<br /><br />But the pivotol issue is the role of the psychiatrist who handles Sassoon's case: his responsibility is to \\"cure\\" the emotionally and mentally damaged victims of war so that they may be well enough to return to the battlefield, which he wrestles with morally. Sassoon intelligence and integrity force the doctor to face the uncomfortable fact Britain's sons are being fed into a voracious, mindless war machine, which is supported not least of all by good people trying to do the right thing.<br /><br />This is a trilogy, but don't dip into the middle and try to catch up later. You have to read these books in order.
B001BKG9SK|1.0|I love all things Gilmour but no 5.1 surround sound on the concert DVD? What a waste!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|First things first...why is this film only averaging 3 out of stars? I think it's because people don't realize that this is 19 years AFTER the last Indy film. Maybe because of the story, the CGI added? Don't listen to the negative comments, this film is a fun movie!    Harrison Ford returns to his greatest role as Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones. The film starts off fast & stays that way until the end...it definitely is an action film. Lucas adds many touches from \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" & even \\"American Graffiti\\" which just adds to the film. The supporting characters are all good in the film too. The film definitely opens up for a part 5 with the newest addition to the franchise, Shia's character.
1416595546|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I absolutely was engrossed, and think that in all ways this was very well woven. It is not perfect - a couple of the twists were somewhat telegraphed, and I think there were a few plot holes/issues with the archivists towards the end.<br /><br />That said, this book was incredibly moving and wonderful. There was a lot of suspense and question over how the second part of the book would wrap up. And I was literally in tears for much of the final third of the book it was so moving at points.<br /><br />I really, thoroughly enjoyed the book, and although as I said there are criticisms one could make, they are rather small items compared to the excellent historical picture, coupled with a very moving story.
B001G5ZKZS|3.0|I've been a fan of and going to Rush concerts since Hemispheres. Saw them 5 times on the S&A tour alone. They are wonderful musicians and performers. The live concerts rock. And this DVD is a great show but....    Why oh why can't musicians of this quality get their act together and produce / engineer a consistent quality sounding product. Rush just seems to have more audio engineering issues than they should, (either lame washed out and tinny with no low end or over amped and distorted to the max), and this DVD is no different. As others have mentioned it lacks low end. Big time. Geddy's bass seems to be almost non existent sometimes. Neil's low end toms and kick bass drums have no oomph or punch at all. R-30's sound quality is better than this....Rio worse.    Too bad cause the show is great. Hopefully they do at least one more tour and live shot and produce it with a quality audio engineer.
B001EB5CCK|4.0|Okay I'll admit it upfront that when I first got this album years ago it was because of \\"Silent Lucidity\\" and as I was going through my acoustic guitar learning phase, I wanted to play the entire song note-for-note and the other tracks were just filler as far as I was concerned.  I finally did learn the entire piece by heart and promptly decided to put the cd away so well that I lost it and also I've forgotten how to play the tune I'd learned almost 2 decades ago.<br /><br />Now that I'm older and hopefully a lot wiser I decided to return to this album and I've discovered that \\"Silent Lucidity\\" although a great track is also among the weaker ones here!  This is a classic album and the band reminds me of Rush with a much harder edge and a much better vocalist and although DeGarmo's a great guitarist, Alex Lifeson has the edge though but again few guitarists will ever be as good as Lifeson anyway.  This album though is so good that you'll have to listen to the whole thing at one sitting to do justice to it and in that sense it is a bit like Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\", The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's ...\\" etc.  What astounds me about \\"Empire\\" though is that despite it's age, it sounds so fresh and would top the charts even today and that is the sign of a great classic album that stays relevant and fresh sounding even over the decades.  This may also be vastly helped by the brilliant remastering job in 24 bit that was done giving this a much, much better sound quality than the first cd that I got all those years ago.<br /><br />This mlps (mini-lp replica sleeve) version though is a mixed bag. First the great news: this album has been very well remastered for an excellent sound and has an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and rather bizarrely has two inner jacket sleeves that faithfully replicate the original lp.  The only beef I have with this and is why I only gave it 4 stars is the actual assembly of the mlps itself which is so disappointingly poor given the quality of the rest of the package. The cardboard is of thin poor quality and looks as if it will fall apart once the glue gets old and in fact mine's already starting to come apart. For examples of very well assembled mlps designs go see the ones done for the entire Hall & Oates reissue as well as those done for Queen and The Band which are simply works of art which showed those concerned had great pride in their work.  The bonus tracks by the way are: \\"Last Time In Paris\\" (an excellent track that should have been included in the original album to begin with), \\"Scarborough Fair\\" the cover of the folk standard made popular by Simon and Garfunkel and so interesting given the harder edge interpretation although not an improvement over the original and so is best described as an oddity and \\"Dirty Lil Secret\\" which is a decent track.<br /><br />In conclusion, this mlps version of an excellent album is a mixed bag because it costs a great deal and yet the cardboard sleeve is poorly designed and assembled but the excellent sound quality somewhat makes up for this. You decide if this is still a value proposition enough for you to part with the serious mullah this retails at.ly poor given the quality of the rest of the package.

0743290119|2.0|I have never read a Weisberger novel, and after this read I don't think I will read another one. The author has a terrific wit and it was evident on occasion throughout the read. I heard so many good things about \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" (both the book and the film), so I was very anxious to read this title. Sadly, I found it disappointing. Our three main characters, Emmy, Leigh, and Adriana were fun, but their story went nowhere. Actually, the most enjoyable character in the read was Otis, the parrot.
B001F7MSG6|4.0|At least this movie was delivered in a timely manner, unlike The Dark Knight which indicates it was delivered yesterday, still has not been received this evening, and after a phone call to an apparently far far away land, I am told that the tracking system is not reliable and I now have to wait yet another week...By the way, HB2 is a hoot.  Recommend seeing HB1 first.
0375703764|5.0|Amongst the most distinctive shifts in culture the Western world has encountered over the last two decades, you would have to include the embrace of postmodern theory and the current discourse of the Digerati. In his terrifying 2000 opus, House of Leaves, Mark Z. Danielewski embraced both.     House of Leaves, a 710-page conundrum and ostensible horror story, is many things in one. It is an Internet home page on steroids, growing into a carefully crafted digital sculpture, and then leaping off-screen in the leaves of a book. Leaves which build a most unusual house.    It is a digital experimentation in type blended with a Derridean embrace of the interactivity of text. It is a publishing experiment become artwork, each page a derivation from the usual formality of fiction; part John Cage, Edgar Allen Poe, Jacques Derrida and William S. Burroughs in cut-up mode. Bret Easton Ellis stated that \\"One can imagine Thomas Pynchon, J.G. Ballard, Stephen King and David Foster Wallace bowing at Danielewski's feet choking with astonishment, surprise, laughter, awe.\\" But comparisons aside, House of Leaves is a unique item that should appeal to typographers and theorists alongside high school kids and lovers of a good yarn. Jonathan Lethem, author of Motherless Brooklyn, captured the spirit of the `novel' when he wrote that: \\"This demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore, put down, or persuasively conclude reading. In fact, when you purchase your copy you may reach a certain page and find me there, reduced in size like Vincent Price in The Fly, still trapped in the web of its malicious, beautiful pages.\\"    Several things are occurring at once in this book, circling an ominous staircase at the center of a home that embraces a hidden secondary space. On the surface it is a horror story, but deeper down it is the tale of a failing relationship, and a tale about mortality and love. It is also a crazed experiment in typography, at times pushing the limits of readability, while testing the limits of concrete poetry in the post-Blast age of the Apple computer. Yet again it is an experiment in cinematic visuality, deliberately mimicking the jerk of the camera. And again it is a test of narrative structure, attempting - successfully - to blend three or more different narratives; the journal of a blind man, Zampano, critiquing a fictional film made by the main character, with text loaded to the hilt with detailed footnotes alongside the notes of a bright but disturbed young man, Johnny Truant.    Here Danielewski blends, firstly, the trend in scholarly journals (and the ironic referencing of it in David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest) to over-footnote every item; secondly the heavy handed polemic of contemporary film criticism and thirdly, the drive of popular fiction.    To take this even further, each element is set in type that refers to its function and narrative relevance; Truant, who brings us this tome, is aptly set in courier. The words of the old man are set in Times and editorial commentary is set in Bookman - book man, get it?    Danielewski also excerpted a part of House of Leaves in a seperate tome, The Whaestoe Letters. The letters excerpt and expand upon a narrative section in House comprising letters sent to Johnny Truant from his mother who is wasting away in an asylum. Touching and poignant, the Letters are an indication of the depths that House features.    The levels of investigation seem endless, the reader adrift in the flotsam of experimentation and the adrenaline of central narrative, being constantly tricked.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Don't foget to crank up the Surround Sound when you pop this cult gem into your disc player! The director's cut is not the version you saw on local broadcast TV but you will be able to forgive the four explicatives uttered in the courtroom scene as you wipe the tears from laughing out loud from your eyes.    How John Waters assembled this stellar cast, plus the trials and tibulations of making the film are all covered in what is about the best bonus features I have yet to see.    Johnny Depp rules (need I say more?), Iggy Pop inspires, Tracie Lords smolders, Ricky Lake is adorable, and every cast and crew member put 1000% into this film with every bit of it showing up on the screen.     Every song is perfect and I dare you not to hit the back button to watch the scene again after the rendition of \\"Please Mr.Jailer\\"     I'd give this movie SIX STARS !

B000002OZY|5.0|The Who's Pete Townshed at that time was mainly known by fans as a guitarist and not a songwriter since he did write nearly all of the lyrics too Who songs. This album would change all that. Tommy bassicly took what Sgt. Peppers had created by The Beatles and expanded it and made it so it followed a constant story line. Tommy is the story about a boy named Tommy who is deaf dumb and blind but in the end he is able too see and hear he just didnt realize it. The amazing thing about Tommy is the band never used a full ocrehsta on the album because so they could play it live. All they used were guitars drums and John Enstwiles French Horn. By late 1968 Pete Townshed having written rock opera songs, A Quick One While He's Away, and Rael, was eager too record a concept album. Originally Tommy was based off the idea of the five states of consiuoness but he eventually developed Tommy. So buy this CD then once you get it go home and blast it for 75 minutes long.

0312867123|2.0|I bought this book with high hopes.  The basic premise was very interesting and the reviews glowing.  Alas...  I'll start with the small problems.  First, Sawyer puts a date on when the story takes place.  This is usually a bad idea since it sort of puts an expiration on the story.  Here, it may have been necessary, given the plot, but I don't think so.  He also likes to keep reminding the reader that it is the near future, but things are ever so different.  No one under 30 has worn blue jeans in years, for example.  We get it.  Its the near future.  We understand.  Just SAY he's wearing red jeans.    Further, Sawyer simply isn't much of a futurist.  The technological advances in the book are so off (and often absent) that it would have annoyed me if I'd read it in 1999.    In short, he keeps telling us this is the future, but it feels an awful lot like flash (pun unintended) without substance.  Ultimately, though, the real problem is that the man simply can't write.  Any exploration of the fascinating premise is hindered by the flat, boring characters, pathetic dialog, and almost total lack of emotion. The narrative tosses out useless tidbits that, I suppose, are meant to be seen as details into the world or the people, but are just wastes of text.   It reminded me very much of something I might have read in a undergrad fiction writing workshop.    In a way, he reminded me of Asimov.  Asimov himself said that he wrote lousy characters, that he was all about plot and idea.  The thing is, Asimov was brilliant, and could pull it off.  Sawyer barely has plot, no characters, and just a serious lack of vision regarding the whole idea of the book.  Worse, he seems to enjoy pummeling language until it is little more than dust.  This is a sad work.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|The remaster box set series brings the group to a point that they sound live as if playing in your living room. To me each album feels like a new album from Genesis because the clarity of the remaster is so good its hard to believe these were mostly analog recordings in the 1970-1975 box set! The DVD's show great concerts when Peter Gabriel was at his theatrical best! The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway surround sound DVD presents the slide show the band used with images of the band overlayed. it almost seemed like a Ken Burns documentary of the album it was that good.     I would to see Peter Gabriel do the same for his collection!

Feeling a little nostalgia I bought the blu-ray version and boy was I disappointed , not by the movie,  but the quality of the Blu-ray. This Blu-ray version is 1 notch above VHS quality and thats even debatable. The scene outside with the fog is were you can really see the lack of quality in this movie.

B0017098GO|4.0|Mistborn is a rare find.  In today's slim pickings among fantasy authors, you are seldom given the kind of story which is truly a feast for the imagination such as the words penned by Brandon Sanderson in The Final Empire.  This is a unique book in many ways, and by hearing some of the descriptions of it, you might just get an unfair impression of it.  I think you should give it a chance, even if you are concerned you might not like it, just because it is such a memorable read.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is simply the story.  This book is really just about the main plot, and this main plot is as interesting as any I have read in a long time.  So many books try to focus on character driven plots, or subplots, or multiple threads, and usually the main plot suffers as a result.  Not so in this case.  This is a simple straight forward plot to follow from beginning to end.  It is not without pseudo \\"flashbacks,\\" loose ends, or plenty of exposition, but it is direct and comes to its own conclusion between the covers.<br /><br />The second thing that impressed me with this book is the magic systemS (plural).  While the powers described in this book are quite reminiscent of the powers of a good jedi, the means to that end are quite unique.  Not only that, but there are two systems in this book which are in some ways related, but in other ways totally unique.  Really, Allomancy and Feruchemistry are some of the most interesting and fresh ideas in magic I have ever read about, and I wont spoil your enjoyment of the book with more description than that.<br /><br />The books suffers some equally unique problems, which I feel are somewhat unique to this author and his style of writing.  Some of his dialogue in this books is quite expositional, but there are many passages of instruction, and debriefing which are necessarily thus.  This gives the reader the feeling of attending a rather unique lecture at times, rather than reading a book.<br /><br />A favorite of this author is the perspective change.  While he spends most of his time in the perspective of one of the two main characters, he abruptly switches a few times, and this feels a little jarring.  Also, his writing doesn't really feel like it is from a personal perspective at all, but more of a casual observer.  Also, Brandon never jumps to secondary characters for perspective, which would have made the whole experience more interesting.  The book does begin with the perspective of a minor nobleman, but thinks better of including other perspectives in the rest of the book, which I feel is mistake, and makes the other characters seem that much more flat.<br /><br />The characters themselves are hardly unique, and might be considered \\"stock\\" characters from the fantasy vaults.  Their histories give them their unique colorations, but the characters themselves alone and apart from this book would hardly be memorable.  It is this marvelous setting and the opportunities it provides which, in turns, lends the characters some opportunities to gain some charisma.  I've heard of character driven plots, but I feel this is more plot-driven characters, which really, in all honesty, has some very good merit.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing about this Kindle read is the rather large number of type-o's, including things like periods for commas.  Clearly, editing was not a high priority for the publisher, and the quality of the print suffers for it.  I really had hard time reading bits of it where words were misspelled or punctuation was absent or incorrect.  I only mention this because the word may have had one incorrect letter, and the word was changed to an entirely different word, such as word vs. ward, or cord vs. card, that sort of thing.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book, having given my earlier caveats regarding the writing style and the typing errors.  I know that this book is worth enjoying despite a few minor obstacles.nge.  While he spends most of his time in the perspective of one of the two main characters, he abruptly switches a few times, and this feels a little jarring.  Also, his writing doesn't really feel like it is from a personal perspective at all, but more of a casual observer.  Also, Brandon never jumps to secondary characters for perspective, which would have made the whole experience more interesting.  The book does begin with the perspective of a minor nobleman, but thinks better of including other perspectives in the rest of the book, which I feel is mistake, and makes the other characters seem that much more flat.    The characters themselves are hardly unique, and might be considered \\"stock\\" characters from the fantasy vaults.  Their histories give them their unique colorations, but the characters themselves alone and apart from this book would hardly be memorable.  It is this marvelous setting and the opportunities it provides which, in turns, lends the characters some opportunities to gain some charisma.  I've heard of character driven plots, but I feel this is more plot-driven characters, which really, in all honesty, has some very good merit.    The most disturbing thing about this Kindle read is the rather large number of type-o's, including things like periods for commas.  Clearly, editing was not a high priority for the publisher, and the quality of the print suffers for it.  I really had hard time reading bits of it where words were misspelled or punctuation was absent or incorrect.  I only mention this because the word may have had one incorrect letter, and the word was changed to an entirely different word, such as word vs. ward, or cord vs. card, that sort of thing.    Overall, I would highly recommend this book, having given my earlier caveats regarding the writing style and the typing errors.  I know that this book is worth enjoying despite a few minor obstacles.
6305971145|1.0|I saw this when it came out and I hated it. What drivel. SPOILERS AHEAD. Atrocious dialogue \\"I'm pitching a no-hitter for the Yankees\\", dumb story, and an even dumber Santa. You mean to tell me after all those centuries, Santa never realized there were poor kids in the world?? And I suppose there's only one child in all of NYC that's homeless??? I love most Christmas specials but this a dud. You'd be much better off watching Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, that was much more realistic.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I've been watching all kinds of sci fi for over 40 yrs. From Capt. Kirk - Sci Fi channel. Firefly is w/o a doubt the BEST of the best. It's a cowboy series in outer space. That all folks!!!
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|\\"Wanted\\", directed by Timur Bekmambetov<br /><br />Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) hates his life. His father left him when he was just 7 days old and it has been downhill ever since. Dead end job with a boss he hates, his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend, and he feels cowardly from the anxiety attacks he suffers. That is all about to change though because like his father Wesley is special. Wesley's father was a super duper assassin and belonged to a team of super duper assassins all of whom have the ability to unmake the laws of gravity and physics even though they aren't really trapped in a computer program. Wesley's father has been killed and his position needs to be filled so it may as well be filled by Wesley...<br /><br />The movie ends and I look at the floor and shake my head ever so slowly. This has got to be one of the dumbest movies ever committed to DVD. To be honest I knew what I was in for but decided to take the ride anyways and I wasn't disappointed, it was dumb.<br /><br />The Good: I can't fault the people who worked on look and sound of this movie. It was a great looking movie and had great visual effects and sound effects. I am very sorry that these people's talents went to waste on this lame duck of a film though.<br /><br />The Bad: Ok, let's forget about the fact that the main character is able to obtain professional level skills at all aspects of fighting and weapons in 6 weeks. Lets forget about the fact that Angelina Jolie's character is able to take a Viper at high speed kick the door open, do a 360 all while scooping up James McAvoy's character unharmed. Let's also forget that said Viper for some reason cant easily out run a work truck. Let's also forget that somehow the characters in this movie can hit targets by curving bullets but somehow can't hit a guy that is just running away from them. Forget about all of that. The frat takes it marching orders from a loom that knows binary code! Isn't that awesome! For the life of me I can't figure out how anyone read this script and thought \\"This one is solid!\\" This is the absolute worst plot/story to have had this kind of money and this level of acting talent wasted on it ever hands down and the terribleness is compounded by the absurd stunts, shooting antics etc. I am all for suspending disbelief but you have to give some reason to want to ala \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]]\\" where the characters can do what they do because they are in a computer.<br /><br />Overall: This was the best looking terrible movie that I have ever seen. It might be better enjoyed with the volume muted but even that may not save it.ne read this script and thought \\"This one is solid!\\" This is the absolute worst plot/story to have had this kind of money and this level of acting talent wasted on it ever hands down and the terribleness is compounded by the absurd stunts, shooting antics etc. I am all for suspending disbelief but you have to give some reason to want to ala \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]]\\" where the characters can do what they do because they are in a computer.

0201626632|4.0|The book is a quick and easy read, outlining some facts of life as a scientist. I'm taken aback by some of the other reviewers though. For people that are in the process of getting, or already have, a Ph.D., they seem rather enthralled/amazed by the content of the book. Maybe it's just because I have been at an upper-echelon school for a few years now, and I get to see first-hand what it takes to do or die in academia, but I found nothing new in the book; all of the author's points were extremely obvious. The book is a little old, but if you can't step back and realize the big picture of what the author says, you need to get out of your lab. Just use your imagination; when he says \\"overhead foils\\", just pretend it says \\"powerpoint slides\\" or whatever.<br /><br />Also, the content is just one opinion of one man. I agree with some of his points, and outright reject the rest. Or maybe I'm just doing what we, as Ph.D.-level scientists, as supposed to do (though the question is not a Ph.D.-level question)- gather information from multiple sources to form our own opinion of the state of the art, and then do some field research to refine said opinion. Multiple sources include your advisor, other professors in the department, postdocs in your lab/department, and friends in industry...go talk to people. In my experience, building and maintaining a network of friends in the scientific community will pay more dividends than anything else.<br /><br />And for the love of god, don't publish five or six papers a year about the same project as the author advocates. As if there aren't already enough crappy papers floating out there in the literature...don't make my literature searches any more difficult and time-consuming. Be like Gauss, \\"few but ripe,\\" when it comes to publishing.
0142000655|5.0|I won't offer up a long analysis of the characters or try to explain what makes this book so special. Of all the books I have read, this one has touched me the most. Read it, you won't regret it.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I have always found John intriguing as an artist, and bought single songs by him but never a full album. After hearing 'Green Light' earlier in the year and seeing the video, I was actually really interested in what other type of songs he had to offer. I guess you have to be a lot more maturer and mind-set so to say to really have appreciated his previous work. I used to have this perception of his music as dry, dull and somewhat gloomy blues type music. Everytime I heard a song of his, it was a slow and piano based song. I guess this type of music really isn't apealling to a teenager, which I was at the time.    'Evolver' is a truly magnifying peice of work and he should definately be awarded for the work put in this record. After listening to Evolver, it seemed 'Green Light' became lower and lower on the list of favorites. But Andre 3000 ... WOW ... I need him to release a new album sooooon!    Songs such as 'It's Over', 'Quickly', 'No Other Love', 'Satisfaction' and 'If You're Out There' immediately caught my attention, and began rotation on my iPod.  As a huge HUGE HUGE Brandy fan, 'Quickly' was easiest the top of all the others simply because they both sounded amazing harmonizing together on that track.    I guess I have a new appreciation for Legend, giving into curiosity really paid off, because this is one of my favorite albums for quite a few years.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I just finished watching this and I'm exhausted from crying.  I really loved it.<br /><br />If \\"The Matrix\\" asked if there can be spirituality in the digital age, \\"Wall-E\\" asks if there can also be love.  Just see this movie.  You'll be glad that you did.
B000ANVQAA|5.0|I am so glad I bought this product!  It's got so much information on the making of the movie and behind the scenes coverage.    You will feel like you are there, on the set with these actors.  If you loved Titanic you must get this Special Edition DVD!    Excellent quality with all 3 DVD's. I give this product 5 stars.    Thank You Amazon.com.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I don't watch many sitcoms, but I really enjoy this one.  The writing is fresh and the characters have a little more depth than most other sitcoms.  The running jokes are a personal favorite.  Who could forget their first Slapsgiving? However the show does depict lots of excessive drinking and some drug use (always hilariously).

B0009VRHLK|4.0|If you like films that are heavy on emotion, light on dialog then you'll like Brown Bunny.  Introspective, self indulgent, seemingly superficial but ultimately very powerful.   It will stay with you long after you've seen it, which is more than i can say for the last 9 or so films i've seen.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This album is actually less Country, and took a more Pop approach to appeal to more audience I guess.  But I like it, and much more than her debut album.  This CD has a bit of Colbie Caillat feel to it too.
B001G7SS96|5.0|The first time I viewed this movie was the theatrical version and thought it was a good film with a disappointing climax.Once I seen the uncut version that is included in this package I thought it was a great movie all around.This Blu Ray Ultimate Collector's Edition is incredibly packaged its the best collectors edition dvd or blu ray I own and I have more than a few.The original blu ray release packed both versions of the film on one dual layer 50-BD disc,in this release each version is on separate disc with 1080p/VC-1 encode which does improve video quality on both versions.You also get a digital copy all three disc are in one nice package within the very large box that everything else is in.Some of the other things included is a 44 page concept sketch book,6 art cards that shows city's devastated by the plague and also a pretty cool holographic lenticular of a few seconds of the film.Im not gonna sit here and say this film is great enough to have such a royal treatment but in my opinion it is a really good film and this new packaging is just top notch A+ better than anything I have seen.So if your a fan of the movie or like nice collectors editions or cool packaging or looking for a gift for someone who has or will have a blu ray player soon this is a great choice.The price is way,way worth the packaging.
0345495004|2.0|It is a well written story of two self centered people. Frank Loyld Wright, an inspiring architect takes advantage of everyone he comes across including poor Mamah who is bored witless of her life of lesiure and phony intellectualism. She is so impressed by his genius that she cannot think straight. Her so called \\"ahead of her times\\" attempt at freedom is just an escape from her marriage, which may be a novelty at that time. It is nothing more than that.    As an independent professional woman I resent Mamah to be represented as a champion of women rights and freedom. Freedom is not self gratification at the expense of innocent people.

So....despite my lack of reading participation in this series, I have to recommend them.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|George Harrison's Beatles songs, while infrequent entries on Beatles albums, are front-and-center on this album. This is essentially a best-of disc of all of Harrison's work, but taken to a new level. The album only gets better as more musicians are added into the mix and the music begins to pack an even bigger wallop.<br /><br />Sometimes, albums that pay tribute to another artist's body of work are often lame, misinterpreted efforts. Not this one, however, as the high caliber of contributors (Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney) pay tribute in just the right way but deviating just enough from the artist's original work by embellishing the beauty of the songs even more.<br /><br />One of the highlights is Ringo's \\"Photograph\\", which was a hit for himself but was co-authored by Harrison. Unfortunately, his subsequent contribution, \\"Honey Don't\\", may be the biggest dud on the disc. Still, it's this variety -- Harrison's Beatles songs, his solo work, and even his work from the Traveling Willburys -- that make this disc worthy of any fan of Harrison's work, even if it's not George himself singing these songs.

0525457585|5.0|My German friend recommended this book to me 22 years ago and I instantly fell in love with the world Ende had created. I was sad to leave the characters when I finished the book and promised them I would be back when I had my own child.   I bought the book when my daughter became 7 and she also fell in love with this world. We shared favorite parts, funny parts, and sad parts, and that was the best part of coming back to Fantastica to me.  My daughter is in high school now, but it's still her favorite.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I was a fan of Pierce Brosnan since Goldeneye, never was so convinced with Dalton because it was too serious for the role. Brosnan was fresh, funny and again a playboy with a gun.<br /><br />All was going alright, till the Casino Royale release. Daniel Craig is a strong actor of indie movies, so how is going to be? Fantastic!<br /><br />I repeat the movie several times on a month and the mood of the becaming is just fantastic, the times, the shots, the plot, the agent and M make so important this movie for the herein of the double oh seven.<br /><br />PS. I am graphic designer, and my final comment is about main titles of the movie, the mixture between Chris Cornell and the animation of poker cards environment put the cherry over the milkshake... What a piece of entertainment we have here!

B001NHDP2O|5.0|Of all the Batman films, this one takes the cake. This is the Best Buy exclusive with Joker's bank robber mask. There is a version with Batman's scowl, but I prefer this one. I thought The Dark Knight was good, but I thought it was different than the other superhero films. I just didn't understand some parts. I wish Heath Ledger didn't die. He would have done amazing in the next sequel. I saw this movie in school 2 days ago and the teacher has the 2 disc special edition that appears to be vandilized by The Joker. I perfer this one much more and the mask will look nice on my counter. So I ask, why so serious? Later guys I'm out.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I've had this SB-400 for about a month now and I just love it! It's small and light that it's a perfect companion for my light but not as small Nikon D40.  It creates a bounce flash perfectly, as long as you're not shooting under a high ceiling.  It's a great starter flash and I say starter because of its shorter range compared to the higher model of Speedlight.  If you want a flash for your D40, D40x, and even the D60, the SB-400 is a perfect choice and affordable too![[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]][[ASIN:B000KJQ1DG Nikon D40 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens]][[ASIN:B000O161X0 Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens]] These are all the three things you need and you should be good for at least a year or two, if you need more, then maybe you should think of going pro.
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|I know Enya is probably considered to be pretty good in her own genre of celtic hogwash. But I have one question: can Enya actually sing? You see, I've heard lots of Enya's music, but without all the fancy-shmancy overdubs, of which there are many, I don't think I could pick out Enya's real singing voice in a crowd. I guess in that way, Enya could be considered the Britney Spears of celtic music, considering that they both make music which depends on the wizardry of studio technicians. Sure, on some songs like O Come O Come Emmanuel and The Spirit of Christmas Past Enya almost breaks free of all the B.S. and you can actually hear what sounds like a fine voice. Otherwise, we're left with the aural equivalent of fog. What I would like to hear from this artist would be an \\"Unplugged\\" album. This would truly show whether Enya can deliver the goods. Otherwise, she more often than not gets lost in the haze.

B001F7MSES|3.0|I am a HUGE Hellboy fan and must admit I am slightly disappointed with the three disc collector's edition. The production company obviously decided to go with a different manufacturer for the golden army maquette as it was no where near the quality of the hellboy bust (made by side show collectibles) that came with the first movie. Unfortunately neither was the booklet. It is less than ten pages in length and kind of deceptive from the photo as is the size and quality of the golden army figure. The poster was disappointing as well in that it is attached and folded in the middle of the booklet. One can only assume to add initial perception of volume to the booklet. Unfortunately this can only lead to damage to the poster or booklet in the process of removing it.... The movie is the only stand out and the bonus features are fantastic! If the same consideration had been afforded to the figurine, poster and booklet then I would have given it 5 stars instead of 3. I am and will always remain a loyal hellboy fan but just wish that Sony would have better considered the packaging and quality of the product before giving the fans such a  monumental slap in the face.
0307388921|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk is an author who writes boundary-pushing, perversely twisted, bizarrely funny, male-oriented fiction that isn't likely to appeal to most women and will offend a good number of men as well.  Palahniuk could be described as an author for the `Maxim' generation but his novels are actually smarter than that.  In fact, if you aren't easily offended, you'll find that Palahniuk delivers some of the most perceptive satire you're likely to find anywhere.  Palahniuk writes dialogue and prose that is not only insightful, but `catchy'.  Few authors can pepper their prose with memorable catch-phrases the way Palahniuk can.<br /><br />The Plot:  Victor is a sex addict who drops out of medical school and who works at a colonial theme park and pretends to choke in fancy restaurants in order to pay the hospital bills for his dying, delusional, anarchist mother.  His best friend is a chronic self-abuser who is attempting to beat his self-gratification addiction by collecting rocks that he obsessively cleans, and on occasion, covers in a blanket to create the illusion that the rock is a baby.  Victor is plagued with childhood memories of being abducted by his mother and life on the run exposed to his mother's paranoia and crazy brand of anarchy (she mislabels hair color packaging so that blondes are turned into brunettes and vise versa and distributes unauthorized restaurant coupons so that restaurants are bombarded with people demanding a free meal).  His perception of himself is shaken when he finds out that he may be the son of Jesus Christ, conceived using DNA from an ancient foreskin; and that somehow, some part of him, might actually be good.<br /><br />Choke is a novel about addiction and how things need to get a lot worse before they get better.  Choke shares similar themes to Fight Club (most notably the rants on consumer culture).  It has a similar tone in narration and features a revelation near the end of the novel that is reminiscent, in some ways, of Fight Club.  Choke uses absurdly broad strokes to explore the nature of addictive behavior and the drive to self destruction.  The novel also explores religious themes, parenthood, and our illusions of self.  The people who `save' Victor from choking are being scammed, but at the same time, their illusion of heroism defines them.<br /><br />If you are looking for a stark, realistic character-study probing the soul of a man who suffers from addition, this isn't it.  Palahniuk doesn't write inward looking novels.  He writes satire.  He explores the simple absurdities of life and amplifies them until they are ridiculous, but in their extremes, simple truths can be found.<br /><br />A warning:  There is a lot of sexual content in this book (although not in a titillating way).  It is crude and explicit and certain to offend people.  There may be women who like this book, but probably not many.  Palahniuk writes with a male voice for a male audience.  He may not be an author for everyone, but for those of us who enjoy his warped world view, Choke is both insightful and outrageously funny.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm looking forward to it.hoke uses absurdly broad strokes to explore the nature of addictive behavior and the drive to self destruction.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|Every track is a favorite! I love this cd! It is a perfect showcase for David's amazing voice. The songs are the kind that stay in your head all day - in a good way! There are some beautiful and touching songs and some that rock out. Buy this cd, you can't go wrong! AH was a masterpiece of an indie album, this one will be a classic!
0446607274|5.0|I have generally regarded The Concrete Blonde as the best of the Connelly catalogue, but that view has changed.  Angels Flight is an exceptionally good novel.  The mystery element is good but it's not what makes this a great novel.  Connelly has always been good at exposing the reader to the politics of the LAPD, but never more so than in Angels Flight.  There is a racially charged element to the murder in this novel that results in political maneuvering and gamesmanship that I found fascinating.  The novel effectively explores issues of racism in the context of a city rocked by Rodney King and OJ Simpson.<br /><br />Bosch is a character with real depth and he's given a lot to deal with in this novel.  His relationship with his wife is unraveling and he doesn't understand why, a former partner is being used as a scapegoat, and his team is being used as pawns in a high stakes political game.  Harry is a flawed and real human being who occasionally missteps, who questions his own judgment at times, who occasionally lets his temper get the better of him but who can also be pragmatic enough to know when he has to `go along to get along' - even when it doesn't sit well with him.<br /><br />This is a well plotted novel.  Admittedly, some of the plot twists are a little predictable, but this is a very entertaining police procedural elevated by Connelly's insight into the LAPD and the fully realized character of Harry Bosch.  This is an intelligent, compelling page turner that is easily one of the best crime novels I have ever read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|I loved the first book, but they just became worse and worse until the thing called Breaking Dawn. I mean seriously, what is up with Renesme? She shouldn`t even exist! And the whole Yay-I`m-a-perfect-beautiful-vampire-and-I-gave-up-nothing thing just messed up the whole reason Edward didn`t just do it sooner. I wish he had, because Breaking Dawn ruined the series for me. And Edward was just wierd. He went from I despise the thing that is killing my wife to I love the thing that is killing my wife. And then just when I was begining to think, maybe Jacob isn`t so awful after all, he had to go fall in love with it. Sorry Stephanie Meyer. You just lost a fan.
1931559317|5.0|I've been thrilled with this little atlas because it is small, attractive, easy-to-use, and includes just enough detail.    I did a Messier marathon last year under a dark sky (Figueroa Mountain, CA) and found over 90 objects with my binoculars (12x60) using only my list and this atlas for reference. I was astonished that I could see objects dimmer than 10.0 magnitude in my binoculars, but this atlas made it so much easier.    I planned to sleep through most of the Virgo cluster, but I kept finding more and more objects that I hadn't expected to be able to see! When you know exactly where an object is in relation to neighboring stars, it will often appear when using averted vision and the binoculars are moving slightly. I even found a couple 11th-mag galaxies! This atlas made it possible - great buy.
B000BC8TBE|1.0|Does this woman know how to sing a song the way it was written?  Just sing it and it will become your own, woman.  You don't have to add 50 notes to every note written just to show off your voice.  This has got to be the most annoying CD every produced.  I returned it.
0385736002|5.0|This series has offically taken over my top spot as my favorite series. Previously the Harry Potter series and the Foundation Series by Issac Asimov were at the top. For that matter either, the Magician and the Alchemist books stand alone as my favorite two individual books.     Just outstanding.
076535618X|5.0|If you plan to read the this book, then start with the first book OLD MANS WAR.  Last Colony stands alone well as a critical analysis of humanity and a fun look at a possible future, but I think it is best when read where it belongs as the last in the series.    Last Colony catches up to John Perry, a 90 year old man in his remade body of a 30 year old, when he has retired from the Colonial Union army.  He was recruited from earth, where they only accept you to travel offworld at the age of 75 and promise that your body will be rejuvenated as long as you serve a term of 2 years defending the earth colonies.  But things aren't always as they seem and John served much longer, meeting Jane Sagan, a special forces soldier as in THE GHOST BRIGADES, the second in the series.    John and Jane are happy in their retirement from army life on a colony when they are tricked into serving as the administrators of a new colony that is called Roanoke--like the lost colony of America.      the book takes off fast and travels furious from there and ends on a satisfying note, which is why I like Scalzi's books.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|Almost as good as watching the movie.  I enjoy the CD from start to finish!
B001C46P2A|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC movie. I love long epic movies and this one totally delivered. Exciting the whole way through with great cinematography. If you like old westerns, epic love stories, war films, or just good movies with great characters then do yourself a favor and go see this.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Maybe I am not the person that should be leaving feedback about this product since I am so prejudice about this series.  I think this was the best series to the Star Trek genre.  It answered many questions to Star Trek, not to mention the HOTTEST female actor on any Star Trek movies or series that of course being Jolene Blalock. Can the producers bring back the series or better yet make a movie.  Well, five out of five is what i give it.

B0012NBDXC|5.0|This review is for the Heritage Press 1941 edition of Treasure Island, illustrated by E.A. Wilson.    One of the most enduring and popular releases from the Heritage Press, this one went through several reprints - reprints that apparently resulted in design changes to the slipcase. This review is based on the 1941 edition in the 1969 release.    A solid and surprisingly hefty book, printed on creamy eggshell stock with ample margins. The design is meant to evoke books of the late 18th century with the quarter-cloth faux Morocco binding with maroon and gold details. Amply illustrated with pictorial boards depicting a map of the island and another color map on the front and back pastedowns. Wilson creates well over 50 drawings for this edition, all of them in full color or pen and ink with a single color wash: full page portraits of key characters, full page headings for each Part of the book, and many smaller incidental illustrations.     273 pages, in a sand-colored matte slipcase, with the introduction by the author.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I grew up with Genesis as the mega-popular, three-man hit-making machine led by Phil Collins (a hugely successful solo artist in his own right); I started with We Can't Dance in 1992, and shortly thereafter worked my way back to the group's 1978 commercial breakthrough, And Then There Were Three. As I learned more about the band, I found that another solo artist -- Peter Gabriel, whom I liked -- had fronted them before Collins, from the late '60s to the mid-'70s. But it wasn't until earlier this year that I discovered some of the band's older tunes through Sirius satellite radio's The Vault (now Deep Tracks); I must admit, most other progressive-rock to which I was introduced (ELP, Yes, King Crimson, etc.) practically drove me to fits, but I was surprised to find just how accessible and downright beautiful the early Genesis material was. I quickly bought the first two Collins-fronted albums, the prog-leaning A Trick Of The Tail (1976) and Wind And Wuthering (1977); but I decided to hold off on the Gabriel-era albums after I heard this box set was coming out.    Well, I can honestly say it was worth the wait. Except for the band's 1969 art-pop debut, From Genesis To Revelation (to which they don't own the rights), GENESIS: 1970-1975 includes nearly all of the studio recordings the group released during Gabriel's time with them.     TRESPASS (1970): After the disappointing FGTR, founding members Peter Gabriel (vocals), Tony Banks (keyboards), Ant Phillips (guitars) and Mike Rutherford (bass) -- then still in their late teens -- holed up in a country cottage with their new drummer, John Mayhew, to indulge in their newfound creative freedom and craft some expansive, ambitious epics. Alas, only the hard-charging closer \\"The Knife\\" feels like the busting-out that this whole album should've been; \\"White Mountain\\" (a hyper-literate story-song about two rival wolves) comes close, though. The other four tracks -- \\"Looking For Someone,\\" \\"Visions Of Angels,\\" \\"Stagnation,\\" and \\"Dusk\\" -- are marked by plaintive, desolate vocals and a pastoral sound.    NURSERY CRYME (1971): After Mayhew and Phillips left, the group rebounded with new members Phil Collins (drums) and Steve Hackett (guitar). The band sounds refreshed on the dramatic 10-minute opener \\"The Musical Box;\\"  \\"For Absent Friends,\\" the short but sweet piece that follows, has Collins harmonizing with Gabriel. \\"Seven Stones\\" is a pretty interlude between the energetic and humorous numbers \\"Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" and \\"Harold The Barrel.\\" The last two cuts, \\"Harlequin\\" and \\"Fountain Of Salmacis,\\" drag a bit -- though \\"Fountain\\" (based on the Greek myth of Hermaphroditus), like \\"Musical Box\\" and \\"Harold,\\" hints at the rock-theater style that would fully flower on subsequent albums.    FOXTROT (1972): Begins strongly with the pounding \\"Watcher Of The Skies,\\" about an alien who lands on an uninhabited Earth. The highly theatrical \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday,\\" with Gabriel taking on the voices of several different characters, is another highlight -- a social satire about corrupt housing practices and genetic control (don't ask!). And the 23-minute closer \\"Supper's Ready,\\" about a couple caught up in an apocalyptic battle between good and evil (?!), actually feels like six or seven different songs in one; it never turns into a lazy or sloppy jam. The remaining tracks are more restrained but no less fine: The ballad \\"Time Table\\" features lovely piano work by Banks; the lush \\"Can-Utility And The Coastliners\\" dramatizes the Norse legend of King Canute; and \\"Horizons\\" is a brief instrumental showcasing Hackett.    SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND (1973): My favorite of the bunch, top-heavy with high points: \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" is a mournful ode to England's Americanization; the funny character sketch \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe),\\" the closest thing the band had to a Gabriel-era \\"hit,\\" is a groovy glam-style number with Rutherford on sitar; \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" is most notable forits gorgeous neo-classical piano intro; \\"The Battle Of Epping Forest\\" is a witty tale of gang warfare in London's East End; and \\"The Cinema Show,\\" with sparse lyrics inspired by T.S. Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" and the Greek myth of Tiresias, is largely a showcase for Banks' keyboard wizardry. Even the shorter tracks are noteworthy: The brief closer \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\" puns on UK supermarkets and lists sale items to the tune of \\"Moonlit Knight,\\" bringing the album full-circle; \\"After The Ordeal\\" is a calm, guitar-dominated instrumental coda to \\"Epping Forest;\\" and \\"More Fool Me\\" is a straightforward love song sung by Collins.    THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY (1974): This two-disc concept album's somewhat muddled story concerns a New York street punk's strange night. Gabriel's droll liner notes merely connect the 23 songs and fill in the blanks as to what's happening during the instrumental passages -- they don't do much to clarify whether the kid is actually dreaming, hallucinating from spray paint fumes, dead and trying to get out of Purgatory, or whatever. But what really matters is the music: Standout numbers include the title cut and the mildly racy \\"Counting Out Time\\" -- the poppiest tunes here, and lyrically the tracks most likely to hold up outside the story's context -- as well as absolutely beautiful moments like \\"The Lamia\\" and \\"Carpet Crawlers.\\"    Bonus Tracks: Six of these rarities were first officially released on the 1998 box set Genesis Archives Vol. 1: 1967-1975: The silly 1972 single \\"Happy The Man\\" (\\"Like a nun with a gun, I'm wonderful fun\\"), the poignant b-side \\"Twilight Alehouse\\" (written before TRESPASS but not recorded until the FOXTROT sessions), the rocking late-'60 demo \\"Going Out To Get You,\\" and three rather medieval-sounding numbers recorded for the radio program BBC Nightride in 1970 -- \\"Shepherd\\" (Gabriel's sweet duet with Banks), \\"Pacidy,\\" and \\"Let Us Now Make Love\\" (featuring Phillips' soaring harmonies). As for the remaining four tracks: \\"Provocation,\\" \\"Frustration,\\" \\"Manipulation,\\" and \\"Resignation\\" were recorded in the late '60s for an aborted film project on the painter Mick Jackson; this is their first official release in their entirety, though bits of these pieces were incorporated into songs the band wrote for later albums.     DVD Extras: The six DVDs in this set contain 5.1 Surround Sound mixes of all the music, new interviews with band members past and present, TV specials and live footage dating back to 1972, and a charming VH1 special about the Archives set. Best of all is the slide show on the LAMB DVD, including the background screen images the band used during the Lamb tour, plus still photos and brief clips of live footage from the tour itself. My only quibble is with the choices in TV and live material -- how many versions of \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\" do you really need? -- but I suppose it couldn't be helped if that's all that was available to the set's compilers. Besides, I think it's cool just to see these handsome young men in action, especially Gabriel in his makeup and costumes.    Bottom line: For latter-day Genesis fans like myself, who may be encountering much (if not all) of this music for the first time, GENESIS: 1970-1975 is an excellent way to collect most of the Gabriel-era albums all at once if you want to look into this phase of the group's career.
B00000I3JM|5.0|In 1989, whilst attending university in Glasgow, it was impossible to escape 'Tinseltown in the Rain' in student bars and clubs.  A paradoxically upbeat but also melancholy song it hinted at a complexity which invited me to further investigate the Blue Nile's music.    I accepted this invitation and found 'A Walk Across the Rooftops', 'Heatwave' and 'Automobile Noise' all wonderfully sensitive, evocative and introspective songs.  However, it is the 'Easter Parade' which still delivers an emotional punch like no other song I have ever heard before or since.    As an 18 year old I listened to this song and recognised the twilight sound of The Blue Nile's home city.  The electronic \\"whoosh\\" on the chorus evokes the sound of distant traffic on the motorway as heard from the city's center.  It suggests that, even in the midst of solitude in its lonely heart, life goes on elsewhere.    14 years later, on the evening of the day when my daughter was born, I listened to same song and found the feeling of time and space which it creates as strong as when I first heard it in my teens.    A beautiful album and the most beautiful song.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|One of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard in my life and I don't say that lightly. These men are truly musicians in every sense of the word. Some songs have moved me to tears while others made me want to dance! Overall I highly recommend it!

B00000I41J|5.0|this album swings like somethin' else, but I don't know what. Like other reviewers have said before me, there isn't anything fancy here; just four grown men playin' swinging, groovy, mellow jazz. For me, this is the jazz equivalent of when a movie buff says to themselves, \\"Tonight, I just want to watch a movie for Chrissake!\\" The longer you explore the sounds of jazz, up to the way it sounds - or doesn't - in our time, \\"Somethin' Else\\" grooves more mellow each time, like Kentucky bourbon. It's the poor man's \\"Kind of Blue.\\" Check it out and don't forget your dancin' shoes.

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|It was excellent, very well done; far better than expected in a sea of junk. Pretty creative, although it did have a feel of a combination Matrix and Fight Club. It did have an important message and a not-to-deep subplot. More than enough symbolism / metaphor. I'll buy it (and I only buy a precious few films). Most of the recent \\"blockbusters\\" (including Dark Knight) have been big disappointments, but NOT this one.
B001D84NKQ|5.0|The film, an absolute triumph, good to see Richie back on form. the music phenomenal!

B000WZAE1I|4.0|Outside of Robert DeNiro who proved that he can only act a certain part and anything else he should retire in, the acting was well done. The world was interesting, though a little more normal than other newer fantasy movies. The animation was top notch. But overall I have to say the movie was one of the better of the recent fantasy movies (not including lord of the rings). While I wouldn't buy the movie, I wouldn't mind seeing it a time or two again. I would rate the movie a C+ or a B-, not really sure which it is a tweener. The storyline was really well done, the execution was great. It wasn't entirely a fantasy movie, it felt more like a fairy tale, but that was fine, it was definitely worth at least one watch.
B000EXZDOQ|5.0|What people don't realize when they're listening to this album for the first time in this day an' age, when we're so saturated with crap music, or even a Whitesnake fan that bought the 1987 album as their first...  This album came out in 1980.   Just think of all your favorite bands and figure out when they came out...  In 1980, very few great rock bands were around, compared to what came out since...  I was a fan of Coverdale when he was in Deep Purple.  I found the first Whitesnake ep \\"Snakebite\\" when it first came out,  It was pretty good, just loved his voice.  I lost touch with the band intil I heard \\"Fool For Your Loving\\" on Hartford, CT radio.  I went out and found \\"Ready an' Willing\\" that day...  My point is, that when this is the current Whitesnake album, you listen to it over and over and over and over... in the car, in your room, with a beer, with a smoke...  That's when you zone into the album and really appreciate and love what you're listening to...  This album has no bad songs...  Every song is perfect, the band was perfect at this point...  Ian Paice on drums, what taste...!!!  Neil Murray on bass, Whitesnakes finest bassist ever...  Jon Lord on keyboards, greatest player in all of rock  playing some great riffs on this album...  Mickey Moody & Bernie Marsden are great blues-rock guitarists... just think of when Zeppelin actually played blues songs over their first 3 albums...  Coverdale's voice is at his finest...  \\"Fool For Your Loving\\" blows away the 1989 version...  My favorite tracks are \\"Love Man\\", great blues song... \\"Blindman\\", great 'ballad' in the vein of Deep Purple's \\"Soldier of Fortune\\"... \\"Ready an' Willng\\", a great straight-out rock song...   I'd have to put this album as my favorite album in their catalog...    Wild Man  (former roadie & Rochester radio dj)
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I had already watch it on cinema, however as I enjoy it and I am a fan of marvel, I decided to buy it, and watch it again, better on second time.   for those about to Iron Man, I recommend it.
B000VI70WM|1.0|I've been a fan since about 1982 (and, as a synth player, a big fan of Nick's work) and have enjoyed just about every Duran album that came out after Seven.  Sure, some albums required 5 or 10 listens until I'd settle down and enjoy the creative flow of what I was listening to, but they all eventually grew on me and bring up memories from the time they came out.  Big Thing, Medazzaland, Pop Trash........they were somewhat radical departures from the early work, but still had heart, soul, and that creative edge that Duran has always pushed for.    Astronaut was \\"okay.\\"  But that's just my two cents.  The album didn't quite stick in my subconscious like previous creations.      Red Carpet just left me flat disappointed.  Okay, I'm not 18 anymore and probably just can't relate to what's \\"hip\\" nowadays.  A younger crowd may appreciate the album a little more (or not so much, considering the lack of sales).  This album is a radical departure from what the band's large base could be expected to enjoy as it departs from DD's trend towards experimental, yet thoughtful tracks and goes straight to the hormonal jugular of today's hip-hop oriented youth.      The songs themselves, despite their driving beats, seem distant, disconnected, and hurried.  The usual musical and lyrical nuances (even in the synths) normally found in a Duran project are simply lacking......and those have always been the heart and soul of their sound and style.      Older fans, like myself, seem to be having trouble bonding with this attempt at contemporary dance/pop relevance.........and the crowd that this album is attempting to lure - they don't seem too impressed either.    Duran Duran - return to your roots.  \\"The Wedding Album\\" was  basically conceived/created in someone's living room studio (if I recall correctly).  Compare fan reaction to what was created there to what was created with the \\"help\\" of Timbaland/Timberlake.      Duran Duran has always had a distinctive feel, style, and sound.  Thisis what fans appreciate and would react to in an album that remains true to Duran's soul.  DD's reunion tour was a monster success - so the fans ARE out still out there!  By abandoning its base DD has lost its revenue base (if you bring it down to dollars and cents) and really needs to get to work on rebuilding a connection with its REAL fans - the ones, like me, who paid to see them in concert for their Astronaut tour.    'Nuff said.    -Mike in NC, USA
B001GJOL22|3.0|The Blu-Ray is good and worth having but I expected the recording quality to be much better.  The bass is just too weak.  The bass drums have no boom and the drums don't have enough presence.  I compared the track Monkey Business from the Snakes and Arrows DVD MVI album and compared it to the blu-ray.  The bass drum sound on the MVI version blew away the blu-ray version by a wide margin. On the other hand I found the cymbals on the blu-ray sounded better than the MVI.  Another annoying thing is the cameras constantly switch angles every three seconds.  If it were up to me I would put the camera on Neil and leave it there.  Putting aside the sound...the performance was very good.
B000002UB3|5.0|Regarding Side 2.............    Only George Martin could create such an enduring tribute to the most prolific musical group in history using nothing more than bits and pieces of unfinished, unrealized and unpolished melodies and abandoned couplets from their studio sessions, weaving them seamlessly together to create one perfect 'suite'.    So much so, that many, 30 plus years later consider Side 2 of Abbey Road to be The Beatles ultimate masterpiece and accomplishment little realizing that none of the four were in the studio while Sir George was busily cutting and pasting their last contractural obligation together on their behalf.

B001ACH4DS|3.0|This CD is okay, but not as good as I had hoped. The gift of David Cook is his voice. His mixing team let his voice be drowned out by the instrumentation far too often.

031606792X|2.0|I had read a lot of reviews on the Twilight series before finally deciding to start the first book. It was well-written for it's target audience (teens), I thought, and very entertaining for me. I found myself quickly entwined in the lives of Bella Swan and Edward Cullens. I tore through books 1 - 3 in the series and while they weren't without some flaws, they were really great reads. SO, I forked out the money for Book 4 \\"Breaking Dawn\\" believing that I'd be entertained beyond measure because that's when the clinchers fall like rain and surely all the bad reviews I was hearing about it were wrong since books 1 - 3 were great. Authors save the best for last, right? I was very sadly disappointed. The book starts out wonderful enough with a beautiful wedding. Then we jump to the honeymoon (which doesn't go into explicit details and keeps the reading at the intended age) and see Edward and Bella enjoying married life until something threatens their happiness - but instead of focusing on that we jump into another story. WHAT?! After I gathered my bearings, I sluggishly trudged through the most boring portion of the book. The thoughts/insights/perception of Jacob Black (\\"werewolf\\"). From that point on, I mostly sighed dejectedly through the book. It just seemed so hastily written that you couldn't wind your way fully into the story. Renesme could have definitely been reworked a bit to make it more believable, Jacob's imprinting shouldn't have been so ridiculously stupid, the whole \\"battle\\" was even more laughable - though you are happy to have certain characters still intact by the end of the book. My biggest issue was the speed in which all the changes start taking place and the huge leaps that were made to make some concepts believable. I didn't mind Bella's new found abilities at first, but then they bordered on the ridiculous towards the end. I did enjoy the last few pages of the story, though, because it finally brought this somewhat agonizing read to an end and left me with one small smile.t me with one small smile.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|If a frog is placed it a pot of boiling water, it will jump out. Yet if a frog is placed in a pot of lukewarm water and the temperature is gradually increased, the frog will keep sitting there, blissfully unaware that it is being boiled alive. Al Gore likens our own response to global climate change to that of the hapless frog; since the change we perceive is gradual, we fail to recognize the perilous situation that confronts us. \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" presents us with facts we cannot ignore, showing how the world we know is already being transformed in a slew of potentially catastrophic ways: disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels, threatened species, chaotic weather patterns, disease, drought, population displacement, and more.<br /><br />The movie goes on to debunk the myth that climate change is controversial within the scientific community. In fact, as Gore demonstrates, there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists; the \\"controversy\\" we hear about has been manufactured by political and corporate interests. Further, he exposes the false dichotomy between economics and the environment, arguing that we need not--and cannot--choose between our pocketbook and the wellbeing of the planet.<br /><br />Gore concludes with a resounding call to action, urging Americans to stop lagging behind other nations and to instead take the lead in tackling the predicament of climate change, just as we have boldly taken on problems in the past. \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" issues a powerful message that must be heeded, for everything we know and cherish is truly at stake.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|I'd hazzard a guess that few people in the United States and a lot of the English speaking world are unfamilar with the words and characters of Dr. Seuss.  Soon after his books were first published, Theodor Seuss Geisel who never quite earned the doctorate of his pen name, the wonderful world of Dr. Seuss, with all of it's whimsy and rhyme, became a favorite place for children and parents to visit on a regular basis.<br /><br />One of the characters that made multiple appearances in the string of Seuss books was the gentle behemoth Horton the elephant.  Horton the elephant was introduced in the story Horton Hatches the Egg.  In that story, of course, Horton substitutes as the mother of an egg.  Several years later Horton makes a reapparance in the tale Horton Hears a Who.  Both tales show Horton the elephant to be a caring soul that feels responsiblity to care for those smaller than himself.  That becomes a mantra in the tale of the Who's as Horton tells his jungle mates that a \\"person is a person, no matter how small.\\"<br /><br />Because Dr. Seuss' tales included artwork and animation from the author the world of the Who's and the jungle where Horton lives are already clear and well established for most Seuss fans.  Like earlier films in the world of Seuss, the animators for Horton Hears a Who have stayed true to the images that fans grew up on and are familar with.  To my tastes, that's a good thing as it means fans aren't asked to accept someone else's interpretation of what the world of Seuss really should look like.<br /><br />Now, I have to say, that even as the animators have stayed true to Seuss' work, they've also done a great job applying modern touches and using the latest animation techniques to achieve great results.  Some of the early jungle scenes on the Blu-ray disc version of the film are quite impressive and offer up detail and perspective that give the appearance that viewers are watching a 3D version of the film (minus the obligatory 3D plastic glasses).  The impact seems less noticable as the film progresses, and doesn't offer up the complete awe factor of say Kung Fu Panda or Disney's Ratatouille, but it's quite nice in it's own right.<br /><br />The voice acting from everyone in the cast is well done with no one over-playing their roles or taking too much attention from the story.  That should be probably credited not just to the voice actors but also to the film's director and producers, all of whom shared a role in creating the finished product.  One cast member of note that I must thank the director and producers for pulling into the project is narrator Charles Osgood.  I doubt anyone else that could have taken on the role could do that job as smoothly and perfectly as Mr. Osgood did.<br /><br />Horton is definitely worth the purchase for Seuss fans, and certainly worth at least a rental (Unbox, hint, hint!)  The Blu-ray version includes both Windows Media and iTunes compatible digital copies to add value to the product.ms less noticable as the film progresses, and doesn't offer up the complete awe factor of say Kung Fu Panda or Disney's Ratatouille, but it's quite nice in it's own right.

B0000A118M|5.0|A LOVE SUPREME was for John Coltrane, both an intensely personal statement, and a gift to mankind. On the brink of ruination due to alcohol and drug abuse, Coltrane had a life altering epiphany in 1957. On the liner notes to the album he writes:    \\"During the year 1957, I experienced by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\\"     A LOVE SUPREME was recorded in 1964 after the death of his friend, Eric Dolphy, and the birth of his 1st son. These events must have inspired Coltrane to create his masterpiece. Outside of Bach's B Minor Mass, I can't think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music. Whether or not you are into Jazz, you should listen to A LOVE SUPREME at least once in your life.
0679745203|5.0|This was the book that helped me find my \\"voice\\" as a writer. The intense, unique, exquisite, seemingly random details Ondaatje uses to convey characterization, motivation, and mood continue to amaze me each time I read his works, but THIS novel has the ring of poetry in every sentence.<br /><br />The movie is an entirely different animal, and it HAS to be, because Ondaatje's power lies in his descriptions; his similes and metaphors; his own private way of viewing the human experience--not in the beats of the plot or the wit of the dialogue. This book is not driven by action but by the heart-wrenching ache of slowly unfolding details that peel back the layers of each character's past until they are completely bare.<br /><br />The meat of this work is found in what is NOT being said, but always implied; a casual reader will miss the depths of Ondaatje's meaning. (And perhaps I myself have misunderstood his intentions--who knows?) But here are a few samples of passages I'm sure are profound enough to make a wary buyer an avid reader:<br /><br />\\"Water is exile, carried back in cans and flasks, the ghost between your hands and your mouth.\\"<br /><br />\\"His hands held together like a human bowl.\\"<br /><br />\\"She paused after each set of notes as if bringing her hands out of water to see what she had caught, then continued, placing down the main bones of the tune.\\"<br /><br />\\" 'Read him slowly, dear girl, you must read Kipling slowly. Watch carefully where the commas fall so you can discover the natural pauses. He is a writer who used pen and ink. He looked up from the page a lot, I believe, stared through his window and listened to birds, as most writers who are alone do. Some do not know the names of birds, though he did. Your eye is too quick and North American. Think about the speed of his pen. What an appalling, barnacled old first paragraph it is otherwise.' \\"<br /><br />\\" 'I wanted to touch that bone at your neck, collarbone, it's like a small hard wing under your skin. I wanted to place my fingers against it. I've always liked flesh the colour of rivers and rocks or like the brown eye of a Susan, do you know what that flower is? Have you seen them? I am so tired, Kip, I want to sleep. I want to sleep under this tree, put my eye against your collarbone. I just want to close my eyes without thinking of others, want to find the crook of a tree and climb into it and sleep.' \\"<br /><br />\\"She sits on the bed hugging nakedness. He slides his open palm along the sweat of her shoulder. This is my shoulder, he thinks, not her husband's, this is my shoulder.

As if organs, the heart, the rows of rib, can be seen under the skin, saliva across her hand now a colour. He has mapped her sadness more than any other.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, I feel like the only one who can describe the mastery of Ondaatje's style is Ondaatje himself, but he seems far too humble for that. I've learned so much from him, from this story; I wish I could afford to give a copy to everyone I meet, just to show them that even the most horrific and agonizing of situations, real or imagined, can be expressed beautifully, and therefore, transformed.lways liked flesh the colour of rivers and rocks or like the brown eye of a Susan, do you know what that flower is?

0307346617|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am not a big fan of horror in general (outside of Lovecraft and King)and the zombie apocalypse sub-genre in particular.  That being said, World War Z is one of the most effective and gripping books I've read in years.  Indeed, it's the first novel in a long time that I've read in a single sitting.    \\"Novel,\\" however, is not the most accurate way to describe it.  As other reviewers have noted, this is written in the form of several short vignettes representing interviews with survivors of the Zombie War.  As such, you might think that there wouldn't be any drama - after all, the subjects being interviewed all survived the war, so they are not at risk.  This is not the case.  Brooks deftly writes dozens of these short vignettes, and they evoke the horror and heroism, the despair and the drama of the war.  There's not a lot of graphic violence here - this is not  splatterpunk, and those looking for that genre should seek elsewehere.  Rather, the horror comes as much from what is implied (how survivors managed to live through a winter without food, for example) as much as what is shown.      As such, it's a surprisingly emotionally affecting book, particularly given that none of the characters are seen for a long period of time (very few appear in more than one vignette).  There are, admittedly, some errors (some of the military jargon and space technology/orbital mechanics are jarringly wrong, but only about 2% of readership will even notice this, so I won't mark the book down for it), and some aspects of the war cry out for more detail (how, in the midst of the Great Panic, were the Western States pacified and consolidated?).  But these are minor quibbles.      You do NOT have to be a fan of horror to enjoy this book.  Bravo, Mr Brooks.
B00186S9CQ|2.0|My grandbaby loves the story of \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\\"<br />However, the signed story on the DVD to accompany this book is of poor quality. Not only are there noticeable errors on the DVD, it does not accurately follow the story. Many signs are missing for the colors and words that were to be presented in Sign Language. I taught Hearing Impaired kids for 34 years and must say that this DVD is by far the worst I've seen to accompany a written story in Sign Language. It appears to be a signer making a DVD on the spot at the last minute, but ran out of time before the DVD was completed. Rather than taking time to produce a DVD of better quality, a bad copy was distributed anyway without thinking of the purchaser or the child learning to accurately read the book in sign language.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|When I was 9 back in 1989, I was introduced to a new world of film.  Up to that point I'd been subjected to Disney films, and the odd musical (born to two ministers). It was with this film based on a comic that; at the time; I had never heard of, that brought me into the world of grown-up films.  That movie was Tim Burton's Batman.  I fell in love with the darkness, I had a crush on Vicki Vale, and was mesmorized by Jach Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker.      It was with this film that I began to collect comics.  And over the years grew addicted to comic movies.  I loved Batman Returns, had fun with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even grooved on Dolph Lundgren's Punisher.  But suddenly, I grew a brain and discovered that most, if not all of these films lacked one thing; depth and substance.  I wanted more than mindless action and 30 seconds of character development.  I waited and waited, and was given very few choices that gave me that depth and stayed basically true to the feel of the comic.  I waited for Batman Forever and was disappointed, likewise with Batman & Robin.  I followed many others with the very occasional jem.  Spiderman and Spiderman 2, Hellboy and Hellboy 2, Hulk (not Incredible Hulk, which was NOT incredible but okay) and Sin City to name the very few.  But never any word on a new Batman.      I began to loose hope, that it would be made, and if so if it would be good. Then 2005 came around and I was finally treated to an almost (not quite, but almost) pitch perfect Batman film.  Batman Begins delivered what I wanted, a flesh and blood retelling of Batman.  Why did he become Batman, how did he become Batman, and what could have kept him from slipping into insanity while keeping a duel life.  I was impressed that Chris Nolan (director of both BB and TDK) didn't go the easy way and use a very famous villian, but instead used a more ethereal choice; with Ra's A Ghol'.      So, knowing that he would make a sequel, I waited.  Soon, i was blessedwith the opportunity to see The Dark Knight.  And finally I had that PERFECT Batman film I'd so longed for.  From the choice of actors, to the deep and dark storyline, Chris Nolan made a perfect film.  Christian Bale, shows us what it's like to be Batman.  The questioning and sad hero, who fights day to day to seek some reason to continue his emotionally and physically exhausting quest.  Aaron Eckhart, gives a suave, stubborn and sweet performance as D.A Harvey Dent, and does just as well showing the despair and mania that is Two-Face.  He is; next to Heath; the best part of the film.  I felt for him when he lost his love, and could understand how he could be manipulated with that pain.      Other cast did wonderful as well.  Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine show why their Oscar winners.  Kudos really needs to go out to Gary Oldman, who wonderfully fleshed out Detective/Comissioner Gordon.  He did a marvelous job showing Gordons guts in his job, his intelligence and his fear for the people of Gotham's safety.  Maggie Gyllenhaul did something with Rachel Dawes character that Katie Holmes didn't, made her a real person, not just someone acting the part. I could understand her confusion in her love of both Bruce and Harvey.  A confusion that put her in great danger.  But to the man of the hour.  Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker is one for the books.  He may not have been dumped into chemicals that turned his hair green and his face white, he may not have used the practical jokes that many wanted to see, but he did what others have tried to do with the character.  He made him scary, manical, intelligent and worty of being Batman's Clown Prince of Crime.  Heath deserves an Oscar nod, if not the award itself. (let the comments begin)    The films action sequences were also very impressive, from the opening bank heist to the freeway chase, to the ever impressive big rig flip and bat-pod sequence.  The action is there also.  There was also something else, that depththat had so eluded me.  You felt for the character's; were invested in the outcome and moved or angered by the choices they willingly or were forced to make (the ferry sequence comes to mind).  The Dark Knight is not your kids version of the caped crusader, it's a violent, visceral and brutally real look at the choices we make or have made for us and how those choices can lead to chaos.  It's also a close look at the essence of good and evil and how evil can twist one's good intent.      So, in short, after many years of waiting; with a few exceptions, I finally found the comic book film that I longed for. A dark, brutal version of what it means to be a hero.  What it means to keep fighting even if you don't know why, and a film that properly shows what the fight would be like in the real world.  This is the Batman for the ages.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not going to write a novel about this movie, there are plenty of other reviews that will give a new viewer details if interested.  Band of Brothers, in my opinion, is simply the greatest depiction of World War II ever to grace the screen.  I come from a generation whose grandparents served in the war and short of first hand stories, this can really drive home the magnitude of war to the younger generation and give us an appreciation for the sacrifices that generation made and to realize our generation gets to reap the benefits of said sacrifice.    The scenes where the abandoned concentration camp is discovered and the German general addressing his troops are equisite.    Simply outstanding.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I'll just come straight out and say that I'm a tried and true Jonas Brothers fan. I'm absolutely, positively in love with their music. I'm one of those screaming teenage girls that stands out in the summer heat, rain, or snow to see them play; the ones on TV that people laugh at because of their intense dedication. I've seen them six times, and three of those times, a 16 year old girl named Demi Lovato opened. Going to my first Burning Up show, I'll have to admit I was a bit skeptical of her. I had seen her in Camp Rock only a few days before (which I'll admit wasn't the greatest) and I didn't really know what to expect. I wondered what exactly she was going to sing besides her songs from Camp Rock. I thought she was going to be just another sickly sweet, sugar tart popstar that Disney concoted in their popstar machine. Boy, was I wrong. When she came out on stage, her stage presence and powerful music were endearing. She strutted around the stage singing her rock driven compositions with the poise and grace of someone who had been doing it for years. A couple months later, her album came out. I bought it the day it came out and was immediately hooked.    Demi Lovato may be sweet, but her songs are more driven by her individual human emotions than any other of her counterparts right now (Miley Cyrus, The Cheetah Girls, etc.). She's not afraid to talk about being heartbroken and talk about human relationships. While some of her songs are more on the pop side (probably to appease Disney), the rock edge is undeniable on most tracks. Her songs are universal. Pre-teens will love them and older people can relate to them. It's almost impossible to pick your favorite track off this album. It's one of those rare ones that you can listen to all the way through and not be bored. I love Demi.

0321525655|2.0|\\"Presentation Zen\\" is written for people tasked to create powerpoint presentations despite the fact that they have no creative talent, no design training, and no money or desire to hire a real designer. It's an all too common fact of business life today.    If this describes you, you'll find the book very helpful. Garr offers good insights on overarching graphic design principles and a Zen philosophy of communicating visually. The reader looking to help develop a mind-set to improve their presentations will find food for thought and action. Taking a holistic approach to presentations, not just the medium of powerpoint, Garr offers well-considered advice that is enough to recommend the book to its target audience.    Further, if you're interested in Zen philosophy, this provides insight into Zen and its relationship to visual design. The mantra of simplicity espoused here is one that can be traced back to art movements of the 1880's, and more specifically the Bauhaus movement in Germany in the 1920's.     However, you may still be hungry after reading Garr's book. Especially if you desire to continue to develop whatever design skills you've discovered while creating powerpoint's. Also, if you are a trained graphic designer, you shouldn't need this book. It reiterates what you should have learned in the first semester of any competent design program. K.I.S.S.    For those wishing to take their design skills to the next level, I would recommend \\"slide:ology\\" by Nancy Duarte. This essentially provides a masters' level course in creative design as related to powerpoint presentations.

This is almost a listenable CD if you remember the Metallica of the \\"...And Justice for All\\" and Black Album days.    I say almost because Metallica seems to be grasping at sonic straws in an attempt to get back in the good graces of it's hardcore fan base.  The problem is that they have forgotten what brought them to the dance in the first place.    Before you dismiss me as another fair-weather or a bandwagon fan, hear me out.    Listen to The End of the Line and then break out your copy of Kill 'em All (you DO have that classic CD, right?) and play The Four Horsemen.  The entire structure of the verses and lyrics of this song are lifted from the interlude from Horsemen (at about the 2:37 mark) but lack the overall catchy riffs and originality of Horsemen.  Maybe that's because Dave Mustaine wrote the song.  Maybe it's because back then, there was inspiration and direction to the material being produced.    This is but one example where it seems that James and Lars consulted their own back-catalog of material for inspiration and fall desperately short of the source material.  Almost every song on Death Magnetic sounds desperate to recapture the glory of the past.    The disk is full of songs based on the Fade to Black/One \\"melodic opening that builds into a thrash song\\" template.  The problem is that the songs here are just that, thematic and overly repetitive.  You don't have the journey from haunting melody to thrashing mosh-pit here.  It's as though they thought that it was the formula and not the content of the song that made it work...    That said, sonically it's INFINITELY better than the steaming pile of excreted bile that was St. Anger.  It even surpasses the mixing of and sonic approach of the stylistically superior content of ...And Justice for All but falls miles short of their masterpiece Master of Puppets or even the Black Album for that matter.    What is it about sound design that these guys are missing?  It's not that it's the \\"classic\\" tin-can sounding mix and old school recording equipment used to record Ride the Lightning, Kill 'em All and Master of Puppets that makes those albums great...  In fact, a little more spit and polish on Death Magnetic would have made it more listenable, but would not solve the song content issue.    It's not all gloom and doom though, songs like The Day that Never Comes seems to fuse old and new school Metallica into an enjoyable song that still falls short of previous efforts in this vein like One or Fade to Black, or even The Unfogiven.  And seriously, how many times do we need to repeat the line \\"This I swear?\\"    All Nightmare Long is enjoyable, but entirely too repetitive, something that Metallica never used to do, but embraces completely these days...    Even 10 minute long tracks from previous efforts like the previously mentioned One, or Damage Inc. weren't repetitive at all, or at least you are enjoying the song too much to notice repetitive hooks or lyrics.  Here we have lines repeated ad nausium and riffs and hooks that are FAR to short and FAR too repetitive.    James, if you are reading this I beg of you;  Please disable copy and paste on your PC or write your songs on medium larger than an index card.    While I can say that the collection of tracks here exceed the filth we've been getting from Metallica every since 1996 with a return to the long-track format and some hints of the greatness that left them long ago, these tracks STILL suffer from the problems that have plagued the band since the release of Load (hyper repetitive hooks and lyrics, substandard mixing and recording, and lack of dedicated direction).    In the end, the result is a mediocre collection of tracks and fall far short of previously stellar workswhile managing to suprass anything else they've done in the last 12 years.    Here's hoping that they continue to move in this direction though, as they are rapidly becoming less and less a metal act and more and more a pop act...
031606792X|1.0|UGH. This whole series was a travesty really, but like any good masochist I plodded through. By the time I got to Breaking Dawn I knew I was in it just for the laughs but sadly, it failed in that department too. I can honestly say this is one of the few books in my life that I've literally had to refrain from throwing against the wall in sheer frustration. There are just so many things WRONG here that it's hard to sum them all up succinctly.    Reasons why this thing almost ended up as wall fodder ( **warning, spoilers below**)    1. Our heroine barely out of high school really REALLY wants to have sex with her sparkly boyfriend. Okay, whatever. There's a catch though. Sparkly boyfriend wants to wait until marriage. Bella doesn't want to get married, in fact the idea utterly repulses her. But sparkly boyfriend just won't let it go and our fearless heroine ends up \\"caving\\" because she really, really wants the sex that badly. The whole \\"engagement\\" scene amounts to Bella trying to jump him and getting denied, then accepting the ring with a lackluster \\"sigh....FINE. If that's what It takes to get laid then I'll do it. Give me the ring that I don't want to wear already, damn!!\\" Really Steph?? That's the best you can do for two people who are supposedly passionately in love?! Nice.     2. Oh and screw college while you're at it. Because who needs an education when your ultimate goal in life is to marry a rich vampire and spend 24/7 with him. What a message to send to your target audience.     3. The Pregnancy. This has to be the saddest excuse of pro-life propaganda disguised as sexy YA fiction ever. If that's your cup of tea then great, you'll really like the first half of this book. If not then be prepared for massive headaches caused by excessive eye-rolling.     4. The Birth. I find it fascinating that the author tiptoes gently over the whole implied sex thing, yet goes above and beyond (wayyyy above and wayyyy beyond) to make sure the Miracle of Childbirth is depicted in a way that would make the makers of the Saw movie franchise proud. If the readers were expecting no less than a monster bloodaholic baby to come out of this romantic union, then this delivers (no pun intended). I will give Meyers credit in that she definitely has a promising future in the horror/scifi genre.    5. A Dingo Ate My Baby? No honey, that's just the werewolf imprinting himself on the newborn. But the Cullens have more important things to worry about, like keeping Bella away from her newborn lest she find the Bundle of Joy appetizing. To her credit though Bella isn't exactly down with the whole imprinting thing at first. That is, until she realizes that having your kid get engaged to the family dog means a built-in babysitter and thus more time for sex with Edward. Awesome.    6. Vampire p*ssing contest. What happens for the rest of the book is pretty much pointless, as the whole thing gears up to to be one big showdown that never amounts to anything. Basically the leaders of the vampire underworld, the Volturi, aren't down with Bellaward's freaky kid and plot to destroy them all. So the Cullens gather their frenemies to lead into battle Lord of the Rings style. Except the battle doesn't happen, except in Bella's and the Volturi leader's minds. Because now that Bella is a vamp she has super awesome magical powers like an invisible shield that she spreads over the frenemies to protect them from an equally freaky vampire that can make them pretend they are in pain. And then they all live happily ever after. Not joking.
0374531269|5.0|I want to preclude this review by saying I do have some minor spoilers here to the plot but they don't give so much away that it would in any way diminish your enjoyment of this book.<br /><br />Having heard about the ongoing conflicts in Sierra Leone and knowing that often children in many different countries are forced into military service far too young I was drawn to this book and Ishmael's story.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Ishmael's story begins as a young adolescent boy who lives in a village that is industrially behind but peaceful and productive.  His world is turned upside down when the rebels come and destroy his entire community and in the midst of the gunfire and fleeing he is separated from his family.  He begins a long and dangerous journey where good people mistrust him and believe he is the enemy, to facing the truly threatening who kill without mercy or restraint.  He narrowly misses being reunited with his family when they are burnt alive by the rebels only minutes prior to him reaching them.<br /><br />Ishmael eventually is trapped in a situation where he must decide if he want to be killed by the rebels or join those who kill them.  He is forcibly hooked on drugs and becomes a killing machine that closely mirrors those he abhors.  The last third of the book is dedicated to his slow rehabilitation and advocating for peace only to be once again caught in the midst of the killing.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book I knew that these situations were horrible but I truly had no clue.  Considering what he went through and how close this is to his recent life I was astounded at how objective his account is.  He does describe his hate and disgust that he may have felt in the moment but he never deviates from his story to try and give a political or social tirade on the events (which if he did I honestly would have been forgiving of).  He does not make the reader feel guilty for their lack of knowledge on the subject nor does he criticize those whose involvement is a direct cause of this conflict.  It truly is just his story with every excruciating detail of how he remembers it.<br /><br />Although I am giving this book five stars, I must say that stylistically it is not one of the strongest books I have ever read.  At times it does seem a bit too matter of fact and certain parts do appear dry in their accounts.  However, his story is so incredible, informative and touching that it overpowers any and all of its flaws.<br /><br />This is one of those books you simply MUST read but be prepared because the details will get to you.  Also, understand that once you read it you can never, ever truly be the same.t cause of this conflict.  It truly is just his story with every excruciating detail of how he remembers it.

B001C46P2A|3.0|No other movie this year satisfied my mushy, overripe, dramatic, romantic core like Australia. It satisfied all my expectations of sexy stares, double entendres, mean scoundrels, naked kissing, pretty clothes, and a sweaty, dirty, muscular Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />As of all movies of late, Australia was at least 15 minutes too long although I didn't get the feeling of it dragging in any part. The orchestral scores were too loud and dictatorial. The admiration of the Aboriginals mysticism was raised to almost a near-condescending level of being praised too much. The critics were right with their middle-of-the-road reviews. Cinematically, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either.<br /><br />With all that said, I wasn't disappointed by Australia. It wasn't as frenetic or eye-straining as Moulin Rouge or William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Nicole Kidman's acting was pleasant as the Lady Sarah Ashley playing her both straight and with tongue firmly in cheek. Hugh Jackman yet again proved that he can be both a guy's guy and a girl's guy playing the rough-hewn Drover--a man who can control females of both the horse and human variety while drinking cheap rum from the bottle and with a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from his lip. The entire cast was a delight especially the young Brandon Walters who played the mystical bi-racial Aborigine boy at the center of most of the movie's non-romantic action.<br /><br />The big scenes of the movie, a cattle stampede and the bombing of Darwin, was worth the price of admission. It made my heart race and me gasp with anticipation even when I knew the outcomes. There was one scene I really did enjoy, but only because of the audience's reaction. The Drover, who is an outcast, sets high society's tongues a wagging when he arrives at a ball to claim his lady. As the camera pans up to reveal the lean, well-dressed, clean shaven handsomeness of Hugh Jackman, there is an audible contented sigh from the ladies in the theater followed by a group groan from the men in the theater. But the sighs were louder, and that pretty much sums up Australia.en in the theater. But the sighs were louder, and that pretty much sums up Australia.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Movie arrived in a timely manner as advertised.  Would buy from this seller again.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Received the Blu-ray edition of TDK.  Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery.    The movie was absolutely stunning in Blu-ray.  I know some analyze these things frame by frame and that's OK.  I simply watched and throughly enjoyed the movie.  Saw it 3 times on the big screen, 2 on IMAX.  This home version does it complete justice.  Kudos to all involved in its production.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This movie was too cute.  My kids and I loved it.  It had us both laughing and crying.  I would certainly recommend this movie for all ages.  I watched it with my three little ones (2,3,4) and they all enjoyed it.  Great movie for a cold and snowy Friday night.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|This was the best movie I saw this year. In fact, I saw it seven times in the theater. As a result of its great success and the huge buzz over Heath Ledger's legendary performance and tragic demise, I figured The special edition DVD would blow my mind-hole. This certainly was not the case. The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes. The other features (the full-framed IMAX scenes, a few mocked-up episodes of \\"Gotham Tonight\\", and a picture gallery) could have been left off as far as I'm concerned. No commentaries, no gag reels, no deleted or extended scenes, and not even a word about Ledger. Those are the things that make a SE DVD worth shelling out extra money for.     If I had looked up the DVD to check out the special features before pre-ordering it, I'd have gotten the single disc edition.  I suggest you do the same.
0596005903|5.0|Even though the third edition is showing its age - it covers kernel version 2.6.10, which is terribly old - in my opinion this is still the best book on the subject.<br /><br />Generally, it is not possible to create an up to date tutorial for programming the Linux kernel, since it changes constantly. SO, the key is to introduce the reader to the way of thinking necessary in order to understand and develop for the kernel. I think this book succeeds marvelously.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|I'm not sure what all the griping is about here.  Do critics not understand the concept of science fiction?  Science fiction: a broad genre of fiction that often involves speculations based on current or future science or technology.  Get that Entertainment Weekly?  It's not supposed to be realistic.  I've had it about up to my a** with these paint-chip eating movie critics who grouse to the edge of galactic hell space about bad scripts and lack of originality.  Three zombies are about to jump you and eat you alive, what are you supposed to say?<br /><br />  \\"O that this too too sullied flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\\"<br /><br />  No, more likely it will be \\"Son of a B.\\" or \\"F me, these zombies are really hungry.\\"  Apologies to all you haughty gas-inhaling elitists who deride every sci-fi film if it is not a Brothers Karamazov parable set in the future.  Sometimes a biotechnology corporation, let's say a company called Umbrella Corp., takes things just a little bit too far and unfortunately we end up with a zombie apocalypse.  These things happen.  Then a group of people - not necessarily thespians of Shakespearean cogency, mind you - get some guns together and form a little brigade that marauders about killing zombies in a search of an antigen that will save the rest of humanity.  And sometimes they will come upon a big box in the middle of the desert, that for no apparent reason happens to be filled with zombies.  Oh the humanity.  Let us all now go bathe, lest our sullied flesh melt after bearing witness to this squalid spectacle, meant so unmistakenly only for the coarse, unwashed masses, who cannot discern TRUE art from a grimy simulacrum of it.  Such is the onerous existence of a film critic.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|I've really enjoyed this EP much more than I expected.  The new songs are very good and album-worthy. But what I have enjoyed most are two of the alternate versions of songs from Viva La Vida. \\"Life in Technicolor\\" didn't make much of an impression on me on VLV, whereas I really like the longer version with lyrics on Prospekt's March. While the new version of \\"Lovers in Japan\\" is not notably different from VLV, it is detached from \\"Reign of Love\\" with which had been combined into one track on VLV. \\"Reign of Love\\" is fine, but it should have been a separate track. I'm grateful that the Prospekt's March version allows me to listen to \\"Lovers in Japan\\" on its own. The one part on the EP that didn't work that well for me was the \\"Lost+\\" version of \\"Lost!\\", which adds a bit of rapping by Jay-Z. Some reviewers clearly like the Jay-Z version, others notably dislike it. Regardless of how you feel about the track, it doesn't really fit in with the feel of the rest of the EP.  Instead they should have used the softer, piano-based version called \\"Lost?\\" from the Lost EP. That aside, the songs on this EP fit together beautifully to become a complete package that is more than the sum of its parts. Enjoy!
B000BB96MG|4.0|This movie is heartwarming, exciting, funny, and good for a whole family, but I think the best actress in the movie had to be Julia Winter who played the role of the sassy, spoiled princess Veruca Salt.  I am a big Julia Winter fan.  Although, this was her only film, she was awesome!  She is great friends with AnnaSophia Robb who played Violet Beeauregarde.  I loved the movie and I love Julia!
B001LMRCP2|5.0|Finally Coldplay shook of the Arena ramshackles that suffocated their songs and made their songs sound alike. This is by far their best effort ever. Songs that can withstand time. Lets hope they are making more of these albums. I will keep buying them.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie has a really artsy feel to it, along with the mystical side that shows the boy being drawn toward the music and ultimately to his family.  This movie reminded me of Save the Last Dance even though they have very little in common on the surface.  There's that struggle and search for meaning, and artists finding happiness in the end.  I love to watch movies about gifted musicians and dancers living out their dream.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie with some good clean entertainment, this is your movie.  Keri Russell is one of my favorites.  I loved her in Felicity, so maybe I'm a little biased where she's concerned.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" tells the story of an early 20th Century oil tycoon, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his interactions with those around him, in particular, his son and a young preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has received much critical acclaim and is currently ranked at #107 in the IMdB Top 250, and yet, I just can't see why. Paul Thomas Anderson is a very good writer and director, as has been demonstrated by his earlier works \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Magnolia\\", but the sprawling character structure format Anderson used in his previous works, just doesn't work in this case. Instead, I just found \\"There Will Be Blood\\" to be overly long, depressing and unfocussed.     One of the biggest problems with \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is that there just aren't enough major characters to sustain 2 ½ hours of film. Whereas \\"Magnolia\\" must have had around a dozen major characters in it, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" only really has one, Daniel Plainview, and he isn't all that interesting. Daniel Plainview's character doesn't seem to change or develop at all for the duration of the movie. I think that one of the main purposes of this film is to show the interaction between Plainview and Eli Sunday (the interaction between capitalism and religion), but there aren't all that many scenes in which these characters interact and they are too spaced out to really have much of an impact (and in my opinion, don't adequately justify the ending of the film). I think that this film could have been greatly improved by trimming it down to around 100 minutes, so as to intensify the focus on these scenes.     As with all of Anderson's movies, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is beautifully filmed, but in a way, that makes it all the more frustrating. It's like a big, beautifully wrapped Christmas box that only contains a pair of socks. It definitely does not deserve all of the awards and nominations that it received. In my opinion, \\"Breach\\", which was released in the same year as \\"There Will Be Blood\\" and received virtually no nominations, is a much better written and acted movie (Chris Cooper was brilliant in \\"Breach\\", while Daniel Day-Lewis seemed to be almost overacting in this film) and whereas I doubt I will ever watch \\"There Will Be Blood\\" again, I suspect that my copy of \\"Breach\\" will be viewed many more times.
0061367036|5.0|Its a very interesting book and its give me more in depth of information about the story itself, especially when both brothers encounter supernatural being. Especially the items and weird stuff that are being used to encounter monster, spirit and demon.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|On November 4, 2006, I posted a review noting the side-by-side differences between the \\"[[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 60th Anniversary Edition of It's A Wonderful Life]]\\" - vs. all other editions of this film released on home video during the past 25 years.  I still stand by that review.    The \\"Two-Disc Collector's Set\\" is a different product.   While it contains the same 60th Anniversary DVD in pristine black-and-white - is ALSO includes a second DVD - a colorized version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" that boasts the best color hues I've seen to date!      If you're like me -- and you prefer black-and-white films to stay black-and-white - fine.  But I bought this 2-disc set because I was curious about how FAR digital image technology has come - since the controversial practice of colorizing black-and-white films began more than two decades ago.  In short, the colorization here is spectacular.    -----     DISC ONE -- There are NO differences between the first disc in this \\"Two-Disc Collector's Set\\" and the superbly restored black-and-white DVD released in [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 2006]].  Disc One is EXACTLY THE SAME as the [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 60th Anniversary Edition of \\"It's A Wonderful Life]].\\"  It has the SAME special features, documentaries, trailers and improved subtitles.  The three-to-four VERY MINOR digital sound pops that tekkies brought up in [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 2006]] are still present - but as I wrote then - they WON'T be a big deal for most families watching a film like this made more than 60 years ago.      -----      DISC TWO -- This disc has the same pristine movie in \\"COLOR.\\"  The results are stunning.  Disc Two offers optional subtitles and NO extras - and NO digital sound pops!      In my 2006 review of the [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 60th Anniversary Edition]], I noted why I kept a \\"colorized\\" version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" on video tape (Republic Pictures Home Video, 1989).  Most youngsters prefer color.  As they get older, they come around to appreciating the artistry of black-and-white.  But early on, they still find it \\"boring.\\"      I recommend fans AND critics of colorization to at least \\"preview\\" how much has changed since those chalky crayon efforts of the 1980s.  A high-tech company founded in 2001 called Legend Films, which specializes in restoring, colorizing and adding digital special effects - to NEW and OLD films - was commissioned to colorize \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" for this \\"Two-Disc Collector's Set.\\"      While the results don't match the color of today's live action films, they're still remarkable.  Given the titanic advances in digital special effects since 1989, I shouldn't have been surprised.  It isn't Technicolor, but the skin tones and background colors are more lifelike, enabling \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" to JUMP off the screen like never before.  It looks brighter, cleaner and more beautiful.  You can almost smell Donna Reed's hair and see the panic in her brown eyes when James Stewart hovers over her when they're on the phone in the scene just before they get married.      Think of well-preserved color movies made during the 1940s or 1950s that weren't in Technicolor, but shot on different color film stock that's still beautiful today.  That's what the new colorized version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" looks like.  It's \\"vintage\\" color, not \\"contemporary\\" color.  And unless you're a technician who understands things like fading or shifting colors, you might not be able to tell the difference between what's original or colorized.  Why?  Because most of us are conditioned to expect LESS technical sophistication from films made in 1946 vs. 2006.      -----      Yes, colorization does alter an artist's \\"original vision.\\"  But the technology behind it has improved tremendously in 20 years.  What this means to the future of colorizing black-and-white films, including \\"untouchable\\" classics - is a subject for another day.     The solution for tekkies?  Buy this \\"Two-Disc Collector's Set,\\" put colorized Disc Two into your player and simply turn down the color on your TV!  You'll now have the cleanest SOUND and PICTURE of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" ever - better than it was for audiences in 1946!  Moreover, it'll be easier to get your kids to watch the colorized version - before \\"they graduate\\" to the black-and-white original.  I hope this helps.
031606792X|4.0|This book was the most outlandish of the four books in the series. But I still enjoyed it. The author cleanly tied all the loose ends together, which I liked so the reader didn't really have many questions at the end. However, it was almost too cleanly put together. The massive fight that was brewing gets dealt with quickly, as does Bella's question of immortality. In fact, she has no problem with the adjustment. The love triangle that was throughout the other books is dealt with at the beginning of the book so that drama is over.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who has read the first three. It does tie everything together and finish off the story well but it does get a little laughable at times. Hence why it only gets 4 stars from me.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Neil Young is worthless to me when he's happy. Well, okay, maybe that's an exaggeration; I'm sure he had a smile on his face when he wrote \\"Cinnamon Girl.\\" But aside from that, Young's best songs have almost always come from the darker regions of the human experience. His music is at its most powerful when dealing with angst, disillusionment, and uncertainty. By that token, this may very well be Neil Young's best album. Released in 1974, On The Beach rounds out a trio of albums commonly referred to as the \\"Ditch Trilogy,\\" the other two being Tonight's The Night and Time Fades Away. Of the three, this is probably the most fully realized and fleshed-out installment. It's a collection of tense, brittle, rock songs and sickly ballads, of apathetic insults and haunted introspection. It's an album full of bitterness and black humor, and it's dark and mean and weary and absolutely, positively perfect. Well, maybe not \\"perfect,\\" per se- \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" is somewhat tedious - but it comes close. Very few songs in this world can match \\"Motion Pictures\\" or \\"For The Turnstyles\\" in terms of sheer spooked ennui, Fewer still can hope to compete with the vicious sarcasm of \\"Walk On.\\" \\"Vampire Blues\\" is a cruel slab of mid 70s disillusionment that features, among other things, a guitar solo (or should I say anti-guitar solo?) that sounds exactly like a vampire suckling the last few drops of blood from a victim's neck. It's also got lines as deliciously bummed out as \\"good times are coming/ I hear it everywhere I go/ good times are coming/ but they're sure coming slow.\\" Brilliant! The whole thing closes with \\"Ambulance Blues,\\" which is a gorgeous and absolutely epic take on life after the storm, with its weary melody (nicely lifted from a Bert Jansch tune) and lyrics that are full of poetic imagery and symbolism. Great stuff.
0545128285|5.0|J.K. Rowling has done it again! Those readers of hers who enjoyed the grand adventures of Harry, Hermoine, Ron, Dumbledore, and the rest of the memorable characters will find The Tales of Beedle the Bard a valuable tome of literature harvested straight from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Remember the book that Dumbledore gave to Hermoine, that one that, with great difficulty, she translated into the wizarding fables that help our beloved Trio on their journeys? Now, with never-before-seen commentary from Albus Dumbledore himself, five of Beedle's tales have been made available to wizards and muggles alike. Enjoy!<br /><br />On \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\":<br /><br />People from miles around come to get help from a well-beloved wizard, but when he dies at a happy age, his son inherits everything, including his father's calling. The problem is, the son doesn't like the non-magical folk and doesn't want anything to do with them. No visits. No help. No healings. No nothing.<br /><br />But when village folk begin showing up at the son's door, in need of help, strange things begin to happen, and all the strangeness centers on his father's old cooking pot. If he had his father's character and goodness, he might be able to handle it all, but he, of course, does not. Prejudiced against all non-magical people and desiring only to please himself, his life begins to fall apart, and he must figure out what kind of person he will be if he hopes to survive the chaos.<br /><br />On \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\":<br /><br />Once each year on the longest day, the enchanted garden lets one person try to drink from the Fountain's magical waters. On one particular year, three witches tie themselves together in hopes of sharing the fortunate blessing with each other, should the garden choose them to enter. Things do not go according to plan, though, as a pitiful-looking knight is pulled into the garden with them. Their difficult journey to the fountain teaches them about the illusion of fair fortune and the joy of real contentment.<br /><br />On \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\":<br /><br />In this, the most gruesome of the five tales, a talented young warlock notices how foolish people become when they fall in love and vows never to fall in love himself. Using the Dark Arts to his \\"advantage,\\" he removes his heart and hides it deep in the dungeon of his castle. Family, friends, and indeed the whole kingdom wish him to find love, but he laughs at them all, until the rumors about him begin to spread. After having his heart closed off for so long, it becomes the hairiest journey imaginable for him to learn to love again.<br /><br />On \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\\":<br /><br />A foolish king turns his Brigade of Witch-Hunters loose on the countryside to hunt down and arrest any magical folk. At the same time, however, he puts out an advertisement wanting an Instructor in Magic. Spying the perfect opportunity to make a quick buck, a clever charlatan pretends to be a sorcerer and goes to work for the king. All goes well until someone finds out his secret. In classic form, the foolish king shows us the kind of fear that can be created when the people in power label a certain people group as the evil ones in society. Racism and prejudice are soon to follow. As providence would have it, though, someone always rises up who puts the prideful in his place, showing him where he has gone astray and leaving we readers satisfied that justice has won the day again.<br /><br />On \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\":<br /><br />When three brothers figure out a way to cheat Death, he pretends to congratulate them by offering them each a prize. The three prizes -- the most powerful wand, a stone with the power to recall others from Death, and an Invisibility Cloak -- lead the brothers down eerily similar paths. Even with such powerful tools, they cannot run from Death. Indeed, it seems no one can.<br /><br />This tale is showcased in Harry Potter andthe Deathly Hallows, as Harry and Hermoine learn that the three prizes are real and that all of wizarding history seems to center on the hunt for the three items. Without giving any of Harry's story away, the parallels between this tale and the end of Harry's journey intertwine nicely for a pleasing payoff and a strong message.<br /><br />On Dumbledore's Commentary:<br /><br />After each of the five tales, Rowling has included commentary by Albus Dumbledore. In these commentaries, Dumbledore sheds light on bits of wizarding history and shows how they help expound the stories' meanings. Readers will enjoy interesting tidbits from Dumbledore's past, stories about Hogwarts, and interesting background details about the struggle between The Order and the Death Eaters and the evil practice of creating Horcruxes. Even though events from the past cannot be changed, for this reader, it certainly was great to hear Dumbledore's voice again.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Beatrix Bloxam, an author from Harry and Dumbledore's wizarding world, believes that Beedle's tales are \\"damaging to children, because of what she called `their unheathly preoccupation with the most horrid subjects, such as death, disease, bloodshed, wicked magic, unwholesome characters, and bodily effusions of the most disgusting kind\\" (17). I, however, believe the opposite. The Tales of Beedle the Bard contains five enjoyable and easy-reading fables that we muggles will be able to learn from and enjoy. The subjects of the stories are just what people should be talking about, and these tales offer much opportunity for conversation and rereading.<br /><br />My thanks go out to Hermoine Granger for all her hard work translating Beedle's tales from the ancient runes and to J.K. Rowling for bringing Harry Potter back into our world's again, even if for a brief enjoyable moment.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens<br />--- First Reviewed on TeenReads.comwizarding history seems to center on the hunt for the three items.

0743289684|5.0|This is one of the most compelling memoirs I've read in a long time.  And it's a book that women, liberals and conservatives could all benefit from reading.  Fantastic writing, modest and upfront with no pretension and nobody's politics but her own.  And a brutally honest view into true Islam as the author experienced it firsthand.
B000MV8ZD6|5.0|A very good movie with again lot of gore and blood with twisted plot and surprises,anyway what could horror fans ask for.............with italain horror with decapitation and meat slicing,zombies,magots and many more,wil give 5 stars
0694003611|3.0|Okay, ummm...<br /><br />Somehow, all of my ratings and reviews for schlocky Japanese movies, Czechoslavakian animation, classic foreign films, experimental shorts, classic novels, and post-modern literature led to the recommendation of THIS.  Granted, it is a classic: at 60 years old and counting, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has apparently charmed generations of children and become a dependable picture book for parents.  However, I am an unmarried 22 year old college student with decidedly adult tastes and less than half a thought to a future of having children.  This makes me definitely not the target audience (newborn to 3 years or parents of such) for this piece.<br /><br />That said, it's not like I can't see the qualities in this book.  It looks to be a very effective nighttime story for putting toddlers to sleep: the repetition of and rhythm of the words creates a mantra-like effect to help calm the mind, the drawings are appropriately balanced and the colors a pleasant mute to keep the eyes from being over-stimulated while remaining interesting, and the theme of going to sleep can be pretty suggestive.  Even as a story-book for non-nighttime uses, it's division between a broader view of the room and then a focus on the details could potentially help kids develop the abilities to identify and distinguish.  As best as I can figure out child-rearing theory from this piece unto itself, it seems like a pretty good deal to get this book for your tiny bundle of nerves and wakefulness.  But what would I know about it?<br /><br />So why did I bother rating and reviewing this product if it's not \\"for me\\"?  Well, simply because it amuses me that it somehow went to the top of my recommendations, plus the open-mindedness behind the idea of taking the Amazon engine's recommendations at face value.  Hey, it wasn't a wasted two minutes it took to read this.  And of some note is the page of the book within which nothing is drawn and the words say, \\"Good night, nobody.\\"  That page struck me because it seems pretty random in context of the work itself plus the idea behind children's development literature itself.  I think it was included mostly to fit everything into the syntax and structure of the book, but still I think it's quite profound to include, among aspects of a room and its details, the sense of nothingness in between all the somethings.  A children's book that recognizes nihil?  Who knew?!<br /><br />My three star rating of this product does not reflect the quality of it: it gets five stars because it seems like a well-crafted picture book.  The lower rating reflects Amazon's specific recommendation of it to me.  I mean, I know how it came to be... you rate some dark movies, it recommends Sweeney Todd, you rate that, it recommends Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you rate that, it recommends some Roald Dahl books (which I'm looking forward to revisiting if they get recommended, too), you rate those that you've read, it recommmends some children's lit, and before you know it you're rating The Paperbag Princess which you remember enjoying quite a bit when you were little.  All because you liked the Rocky Horror Picture Show!  Can't say I'm really complaining, though, because this has been a fairly fresh and unique review to approach writing.  I've never really had to consider the qualities of picture books before, but their graphic presentation and concise wording present interesting things to think about unto themselves.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBetty random in context of the work itself plus the idea behind children's development literature itself.

0553582038|3.0|\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is the fourth book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. The War of the Five Kings appears to be almost at its end, with King Tommen and the Lannisters firmly in control of the Iron Throne, although the King's Hand, Lord Tywin, is dead and his son Tyrion has escaped imprisonment. It is a time of change in King's Landing; a time of political manoeuvring as Cersei consolidates her power as Queen Regent, albeit lacking the unflinching support of her brother Jaime. Meanwhile the Iron Islands prepare to choose a new king following the death of Balon Greyjoy, while in Dorne there is growing dissatisfaction with Prince Doran's allegiance to the Lannisters.    Martin's world is as always rich in detail and variety, from the wintry heights of the Eyrie, to the the septry above the mudflats near Saltpans, and the sun-scorched lands of Dorne. The two main cities featured - King's Landing and Braavos - each have their own distinct character and are made easy for the reader to visualise. Likewise the society and religious life of his world have been given full thought, and a whole host of interesting minor characters help to bring the pages to life.    The decision to devote this book entirely to affairs in the South of Westeros - while the sequel focuses on the North and the lands across the sea - remains a contentious topic among fans. Unfortunately it is a decision which has not paid off. Too much space is afforded to lesser characters and their quests, such as Brienne - who wanders from place to place without real purpose - and Sam and Sansa - who remain largely isolated without much room to develop as characters. Cersei occupies more pages than any other character, and yet the majority of her story is filled with the minutiae of court life - matters that on the whole are of little interest to the reader.     Essentially the book lacks a strong central narrative arc; there seems to be little of the intrigue and conspiracy which has characterised the series to date. Indeed, it is only in roughly the final 150 pages that events begin to really acquire momentum, and there is a sense that the book has found the essence which made the earlier volumes so engaging. Admittedly it is in some ways frustrating for the book to end at this point - but on the other hand it means that plenty of hooks are created, setting the scene well for the sequels.    Ultimately, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is a somewhat frustrating read, and though occasionally it shows flashes of brilliance, for the most part remains relatively bland. As usual, a list of all the characters is appended to the main novel - helpful in particular for readers returning to the series after a long wait. Also included is a preview chapter from the sequel, entitled \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".
B001GM28HO|5.0|Surprise, for a debut album to be this good, and here i was thinking she was just a 1 hit wonder. Okey the WHOLE album it's one stop party, the lyrics are hot, her voice it's super different in a good way... Love ur dance music, then this album it's for you.... Watch out pop Divas here comes Lady Gaga.........
B000M4RG42|3.0|A big ambitious film, this one tries very hard but ultimately falls short of being the majestic look at the meaning of it all that Clint strove for. The story behind the Iwo Jima flag raising is an intriguing one and this film lays it bare, though the structure of flashbacks may not help. Is it about the misplaced idoltry, the meaning of war, the Greatest Generation, the stories of the soldiers involved? Yes, yes yes etc. It just doesn't quite achieve those goals. Still, it's a valiant effort, well worth watching as Clint keeps cranking out the best work of his career.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Continuum was the better Stargate SG-1 movie because of a more original story. Nonetheless, time travel was done multiple times throughout the SG-1 series but it has always intrigued me. The Layman's Guide to Time Travel segment was rather enjoyable as an actual Astrophysicist describes some of the fundamental concepts behind time travel and the use of Einstein-Rosen bridges (aka wormholes). The Grandfather paradox also played a short role in the film, but many questions were still left unanswered although the viewer can assume the path of events (namely Mitchell's return to 1939 and how the other Mitchell figures out the events at the end of the movie). It was an excellent Stargate movie but the overall feel still seemed like a long series finale rather than a motion picture caliber film. I suppose it is necessary to keep the budget down and I would still recommend SG-1 fans watch Continuum because it wraps up everything quite nicely and a LOT of the old characters make a reappearance.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I rarely take my chances on pop music but I decided on a whim to check out Lady Gaga's album THE FAME after reading some positive reviews on the album and the artist herself. I got the cd yesterday and I haven't been able to stop listening to it. The music is incredibly infectious. I have not heard a pop album as addictively catchy as THE FAME. The music puts a huge smile on my face whenever I listen to it. The music has a ton of energy, club friendly dance beats,  and infectious pop hooks. A lot of the melodies has a good '80s vibe. The lyrics may be a bit silly and often on the stupid side but THE FAME is not supposed to be a gloomy, melancholy album. This is a fun pop album. The one song that really stood out for me is \\"Poker Face\\". I love the elctro pop beats and the pop hooks. The rest of the album is great but that song in particular is my personal favorite song. Lady Gaga has a pretty good voice. She reminds me of Gwen Stefani from time to time but nowhere near as annoying as Gwen (whose voice irritates the beezjebus out of me). I should note that there is one song on the album that I wasn't too particularly keen on which is \\"Brown Eyes\\". The melodies and the lyrics was pretty awful IMO. Despite weak lyrics and \\"Brown Eyes\\", I still think THE FAME is worthy of five stars.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I felt The Ark of Truth was a great finale to the Ori storyline, however the movie was too short and seemed like a long season finale rather than a motion picture caliber movie. The acting was top of the line Stargate SG-1 fare but I wasn't impressed with the use of replicators as a catalyst in the story. The \\"Terminator\\" also made it more cheesy because the replicators could have just made multiple Terminators without the need for human tissue. Why stay in a crab-like form all the time? It is in my humblest opinion that Continuum was a much more polished story, primarily because The Ark of Truth was a quick finish to the Ori storyline. For the Trekkies, the actual Ark of Truth was really an \\"Adjust the Heisenburg\\" matrix style solution to a problem. I highly recommend watching The Ark of Truth just so you get closure for SG-1 prior to Sci-Fi's cancellation of the series.
B001DHXT2A|3.0|I like Ang Lee's Hulk. I thought that was a great movie. I enjoyed the, Sins of the Father, storyline. The characters, Bruce Banner and the Hulk's persona were portrayed well by the actors.     I like The Incredible Hulk, too. The story was strong and the actors did what they needed to do with the characters to move the story along. Tim Roth is a great actor, yet the Abomination isn't the greatest adversary.     ****  Spoiler:  The inclusion of Tony Stark and Stark Industries in the movie are cool and possibly an exciting thing to look forward to in upcoming films!  ****    I am not impressed with the three disc special edition. I was expecting an alternate version included with extended scenes and added footage.     The alternate opening is nothing to write home about.     ****  Spoiler: There is a blurry silhouette that is supposedly Captain America frozen in ice. It's there, yet it doesn't clearly resemble Captain America.  ****    The second disc of extras are okay, yet why more deleted scenes?    Why a third disc solely for a digital copy? They could have released an alternate cut of the film on the third disc. Especially, with all those deleted scenes.     There are some two disc and three disc special edition releases that merit purchasing. The Incredible Hulk isn't one of them. The single disc edition would suffice.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|While not as adventurous as the previous two Fireman outings, this album still maintains that same spirit; only this one is better and more structured. It seems that when Paul McCartney buries his ego his work tends to grow and prosper; as is the case here under the pseudonym the Fireman. There is a lot going on here on this CD. It is very eclectic. At times it is new age, techno, danceable, psychedelic and haunting. It sort of reminds me of an updated version of the \\"White Album\\". This type of thing is good for Paul, to spread his wings and not be afraid to venture into new territory. He really pulls the whole thing off nicely. I liked this one a lot.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Queen was the quintessential glam-rock mush.  The musicianship was great, but the product didn't rock at all.  Paul Rodgers changes all of that.  Now this group rocks!  The only problem is that the musicians should have changed the name of the group to something else...anything else.  Queen is dead, and long live Queen in our memories (get over it.)  Paul Rodgers is NOT a 'poser'.  Paul Rodgers is a part of what we call ROCK, and this music ROCKS!
0060899220|5.0|He had me at \\"preface\\".    I haven't actually finished reading it so this review may be premature.  Immediately after I started the book, I began to read passages outloud to my boyfriend who gifted this book.  If this tells you anything, I buy books from Amazon all the time but this is the first review I've ever written.    Anthony Bourdain is someone I picture myself hanging out with my friends over a long nice meal.  Just as I had imagined from watching his show, No Reservations, the author is witty, sarcastic, and offensively-yet-refreshingly blunt.  I'm loving it!    I really recommend this book for you and for your friends who pride in themselves as cooks, chefs, servers, and of course, the foodies.  Enjoy!

B001GQ2TGA|3.0|This is a very pleasant collection of songs but unlike most of her other albums some of the songs seem a bit too much like other songs in the album.  Still I listen to it nonstop in my truck and others I know like it also.  Nothing overpowering but good basic music.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I bought this CD because I heard BAD GIRLFRIEND on the radio.  I liked that song so well that I thought I would take a chance on buying the CD in hopes I might like other songs. Their basic sound reminds me of Nickleback, but with more of an edge.  Now I'm not a teenager by any stretch (over 50 and a grandmother)and my taste has never run to hard rock, but never say never. (This group, Theory of a Deadman, would probably cringe if they read this.)   The more I listen to this CD, the more I love it.  I'm sure I am not their average fan, but after playing it in my office, several of my work associates are also new fans.  There is not one track I don't like. Although I particulary like Sacrifice and the poignant Wait for Me; Bad Girlfriend remains the track I want to hear when I'm on the road. I am sure I'll sample and buy more of their music.  Who knows?  With music this good, I may show up at a concert!!
B0018M6J90|5.0|This movie begins with a flurry of frivolous behavior.  However, by the end, it becomes a fairy tale.  Will any of us have a day like this?  Probably not.  But isn't that what movies are for? I enjoyed this movie because it was far from reality--something I want now and then in a good film.  It isn't something you are likely to see every day, which makes it exceptional.     This movie is for those who enjoy a little romance and sentimentality.  I live in the real world every day, so a little fantasy with Miss Pettigrew was a much needed escape.
B0013FNC38|5.0|It all starts with a Deacon Blue riff then to Tower of Power with Jamiroquai beats and lets Pop . It follows with the not so new Jack Johnson Brett Dennen Matt Costa folk and good singing and crafting that Jason can bring to a song . Lot´s of Stevie Wonder wonder to top it off . There is even some Earth Wind and Fire with ( you won´t believe ) Gino Vannelli . Great recording , like it to uplift the soul on a rainy day ... Really good arrangements ... His RESTAREA is okey even that I am not very fond of Hats ...
B001EYGOEM|5.0|When I first heard her song \\"Tim McGraw\\" and saw the video, I didn't expect Taylor Swift to become a huge household name. Around that time, there were a few one-hit-wonder artists and I had a slight feeling she would be one. Then I heard \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" and she instantly stole my heart, and continued to do so with \\"Our Song\\" and it's adorable video. I didn't purchase the first album but then decided to download it and I'm glad I did, and was definately going to purchase \\"Fearless.\\" I pre-ordered it and it was not a mistake and money was well-spent. I actually like every song on the cd. I work at a day care and I actually play the cd while they sleep 90% of the time. Here's my review of each song:     1. FEARLESS (4/5) - Good way to start off the cd. It's my co-worker's favorite song on the cd. Lyrics are great and makes you want to do what the song describes.  2. FIFTEEN (4/5) - Describing her freshman year experience. Although it's HER experience, you find it hard not to relate to bits and pieces of it.  3. LOVE STORY (5/5) - Ahhh...Love Story. This song should have been in the movie \\"The Notebook.\\" The video and song are just amazing. It's one of the catchiest songs on the album and irresistable to sing along to.   4. HEY STEPHEN (4/5) - I have a feeling many girls out there relate to this song but are making a change to the name \\"Stephen.\\" It's slow yet upbeat with catchy lyrics.  5. WHITE HORSE (5/5) - Now this is MY favorite song on the album. It's so beautifully sung and written. I can definately relate to it. If the man who broke my heart into a million pieces ever comes back to me, I'll have this song ready to throw in his face.   6. YOU BELONG WITH ME (5/5) - I love singing along to this song. One of the most relatable on the album.   7. BREATHE (5/5) - I heard Colbie Callait would be featured on this song, so I highly anticipated it. She co-wrote it with Taylor and sings background vocals. I wish it was a duet so we could hear more of Colbie, butnonetheless, it's a great song.  8. TELL ME WHY (4/5) - Not a favorite but still great!  9. YOU'RE NOT SORRY (5/5) - Another song I relate to, and dedicated to my ex.  10. THE WAY I LOVED YOU (5/5) - \\"So in love that I acted insane\\" = ME.  11. FOREVER & ALWAYS (4/5) - \\"It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.\\" It's catchy and well-written.  12. THE BEST DAY (5/5) - This song makes you want to call up your mom and tell her you love her. It reminds us of how our moms are always there for us and all the great memories we've had with them.  13. CHANGE (4/5) - The song featured on the Olympics. It's a good song but not one of my favorites.     Need a Christmas gift idea? Go buy this cd for every girl you know and purchase a copy for yourself as well. You will not be disappointed!!    ~*Carly*~
B000058A1G|3.0|I have several times seen The Action being compared to great sixties Mod bands like the Who and Small Faces. This, of course, makes you curious to heard some of the band's music, which is really releatively limited - they never released an album during their time together.<br /><br />They may very well have been a great live-band, with the vocals as their greatest strenght, but judged from this compilation, comparisons with the two aforementioned bands seem a little far-fetched. Agreed, the album has its great moments, but genereally the band lacked interesting original material, and several of their cover versions aren't really that interesting.<br /><br />Soundwise the recordings are pretty uneven, too. On some tracks the drums sound as if they were recorded in a gymnasium, which of course does not help the overall impression of the band.<br /><br />As I said some tracks do stand out, and these may indicate what the band might have grown into. In fact they did record an album, which I unfortunately never have heard so far, but songs like the melodic \\"Since I Lost My Baby\\", the catchy \\"The Place\\" , their original \\"Something Has Hit Me\\", the Goffin/King song \\"Wasn't it You\\" and their final single \\"Shadows and Reflections\\" are all great tracks in themselves. Interesting that 2 of these highlights weren't released until long after the band split up.<br /><br />Uneven compilation with some great moments.

0545128285|3.0|I love the Harry Potter series, but this isn't anything exceptional.  As opposed to Fantastic Beasts and Quidditch Through the Ages, this book doesn't teach you anything new. It's basically rehashing old information that you get in the Harry Potter series - the Muggle/Witch conflict and the prejudice against Muggles.  It's cutesy and short.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is one amazing show.  Any fans of horror genre should check this out, its a great adventure.  It has sweet action scenes, great dialogue and its funny moments. The two main actors do an excellent job, and make the watcher actually care what happens to them both.  I can not say enough about how much I have enjoyed this show.
0380018179|5.0|Colleen McCollough's \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is more than just a beautifully written epic.  It transports the reader into another time and place so completely and effortlessly that it is virtually impossible to put the book down.  I found myself resenting the interruptions of my  real life when I first read it, at the age of 12, in 1978.  From Ms. McCollough I learned about the process of menstruation, experiencing with Meggie her fear and awe as her body changed and grew.  In this book, I discovered my own emotional range, which was far greater than I had ever known.  Perhaps because I first read it at such a vitally impressionable age -- and I should mention that I have read and re-read the book more than twenty times in the 30 years that have passed since then -- \\"The Thorn Birds\\" came to represent my coming-of-age story.  Meggie Cleary is the character with whom I have identified my entire adult life, never mind the fact that I am a gay man living sixty years later and half a world away from her.  Her agonies, her triumphs, her strength, and, most of all, her capacity to love, left an impression on my young spirit that have only grown more intense with the passing years.  Needless to say, this is my all-time favorite book, but more than that, it is a life-changing experience for the reader who can appreciate the detail of Ms. McCollough's research, the elegance of her prose, the depth and humanity of her characters.  \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is truly one of the greatest works of literature ever written, the kind of masterpiece that every artist dreams of producing just once in a lifetime.
B00007AJGH|4.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a film I watched over and over again as a child. This film is somewhat dated now but Bob Hoskins is the crowd pleaser here. The voice of Jessica Rabbit is provided by '80s sex kitten Kathleen Turner, she turns up the heat for sure. I love the live action and animation, very clever film. Gotta check it out! Enjoy.
B00005JLKB|4.0|If you've been a fan of SUPERMAN from the 50's and 60's, you'll totally enjoy the first season of SMALLVILLE! One of my twenty-three year old students lent me his copy for a weekend. I had my own two 8-hour marathons---watching all thirteen episodes and the special features in two days! This first series erases any qaps about how Superman came to be. The importance of FAMILY and FRIENDS are highlighted.
0515141429|5.0|It didn't matter that I read Killing floor last instead of first. It was still a very good book and a nice intro to Jack Reacher, this is another series that I really like and have collected. Jack Reacher is unique and fun, it's nice to follow someone that you really don't know from one book to the next where he will be, that is some of the appeal of Reacher, you just never know, a man without a home base, there's no telling where he'll wind up, or what kind of messes he'll end up in.
0789208547|2.0|Although there are plenty of large prints of his work the quality here is terrible! The colours are washed out and grainy, doing Rockwell a great disservice by not being a true representation of his amazing work, Very disappointed I bought this.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|I had high expectations. The cast is brilliant - the director as well. Yet these characters just seemed undeveloped - there wasn't enough going on to tie them closely enough. It was mainly a set of acquaintances thrown together. And maybe just 1 man would've helped keep this movie interesting. I think Diane English had a gazillion-dollar opportunity - but it seemed to fall flat.  Predictable - boring - and too much posing. Ok Meg, we get \\"the hair.\\"      I wished to see more struggle - then maybe I could've bought the ending. Too bad.
0345452585|3.0|I really like this author, and was somewhat disappointed in this book. It kept my interest, but was lacking on the suspense. Sure, the reader wants to figure out who the killer is, and the clues come slowly, but never once was the hero in any danger himself. A kindly old doctor slowly send him the clues to figure out, but that is about it. Not my favorite, but if you are a fan of Kellerman, give it a try.

B000050XEI|5.0|I played this for my babies after they were born and it really soothed them, and myself for that matter.  My older children still enjoy listening to these songs and recall hearing them when they were younger.<br /><br />Excellent for long drives as well!
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|I dunno. To me, this movie is worth around three stars, maybe three and a half...<br /><br />This isn't exactly what I'm jones-ing for when I tune in to a James Bond adventure. In re-imagining a grittier and darker franchise, with its stories placed strictly in real-world situations (no wild shootouts in outer space here), and in an effort to portray a leaner and meaner James Bond, QUANTUM OF SOLACE (and what's up with that inscrutable title?) again eschews some of the franchise's classic elements, the stuff which sets 007 apart from the other globe-trotting spies. There may be ramped-up action set pieces in this one, but the overall bleakness of the lead character depresses the hell out of you. Where did that sense of fun go?<br /><br />Okay, if you're gonna branch out into a different direction, then you better tell a whopping good story. QUANTUM OF SOLACE, 22nd in the string of James Bond pictures, doesn't. In this one, Bond uncovers a nebulous organization which has managed to ensconce its agents in those elite circles deeply influential on the world stage. As things play out, a takeover plot surfaces, involving the monopolizing of Bolivia's water supply, and this Bond must avert, even if it means going rogue.<br /><br />The movie follows up on the preceding (and superior) film [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], which featured the death of James Bond's traitorous lady love, Vesper Lynd. Turns out that Bond is taking her passing real hard, and finding it a struggle to balance his mission with his thirst for get-back. He ends up partners with a beautiful Bolivian operative who bears her own internal (and external) scars. As Bond interviews people and as they begin to die in his vicinity, M, the no-nonsense MI6 matriarch, begins to question his dedication and true motivations.<br /><br />No doubt, the era of the blonde and dour James Bond got off to a rip-roaring start with CASINO ROYALE. But the franchise takes a step back with QUANTUM OF SOLACE. It doesn't bode well that the opening car chase is so lame and lackluster, with the director woefully piggybacking on those trademark Jason Bourne quick-cut, herky-jerky edits. And, taking a page from BOURNE ULTIMATUM, there's also a breakneck rooftop sequence. Daniel Craig can act, but the overwhelming thing he's got going for him is his physicality. His is the most physical and burly 007 since Sean Connery and George Lazenby drew salaries from Her Majesty's Secret Service, and surely a marked contrast from Pierce Brosnan's unimpressive frame. Craig's action sequences suggest a more intense, more brutal brand of violence. But a dichotomy rears up. The impression with CASINO ROYALE is that Bond is new to his license-to-kill status. But, in this movie, a direct continuation from CASINO ROYALE, he comes off more as a jaded, well experienced agent.<br /><br />In this leaning towards real-world based plotlines, there aren't many theatrical villains. The bad guys we end up with here tend to be very unremarkable sorts, although Mathieu Amalric isn't half bad as the sinister tycoon. The film does stick with its trademark two hotties rule, but halfway discarded are those tittilating names bestowed on the femme fatale with cheeky panache. The two women gracing this screen are lovely but nondescript types, with the main actress Olga Kurylenko touting the uninspired moniker of Camille Montes. Gemma Arterton, who gets secondary status, fares better, insisting that she be referred to solely by her surname. It's not until the end credits roll around that we find out her full name, which merits a rueful smile.<br /><br />We're all clued in, by now, that James Bond is damaged goods. But previous actors's takes on 007 were punctuated with a certain lighthearted touch (excepting the somber Timothy Dalton). I was on board with CASINO ROYALE's stripping Bond back to basics. But, in forsaking the glibness, QUANTUM OF SOLACE goes too far the other way. Daniel Craig's incarnation is striking in his moroseness, and in his utter lack of humor (and, yes, given, his girl had just died). There's this air of hopelessness about him. Add to that his single-minded, almost soulless devotion to his task at hand, and it adds up to a largely unempathetic character. As a nod to contemporary times, beginning with Pierce Brosnan's run, the characters in the film have been referencing Bond's misogynistic bend, his callous manipulation of not only women but of his friends. And, with the absence of whimsy and of that humor most often embodied in a wrily delivered catchphrase, there's not much to redeem his character or blunt that hard edge. As it is, this Bond is reduced to being a cold-hearted and unsympathetic killer, which is his core, anyway. Might as well put a skull design on his chest and have him start scribbling into war journals, know what I mean? Or maybe that's too harsh.<br /><br />CIA's Felix Leiter is here, as is Bond's beloved Aston Martin. Judi Dench remains a hard-bitten but comforting constant. There's even a callback to a classic scene in [[ASIN:B000M53GMC Goldfinger]]. But, frankly, I miss Q and his whizbang gadgetry, and also Miss Moneypenny. I miss the vodka martini and the \\"Bond. James Bond.\\" And I miss that nicely turned double entendre. The James Bond franchise endures, but there's not much solace found in this film.on is striking in his moroseness, and in his utter lack of humor (and, yes, given, his girl had just died).

B0013FSL3E|4.0|I ordered this DVD for my son for Christmas so we haven't had the chance to watch it yet but from reading previous reviews I can't wait until we do. The DVD arrived in perfect condition and is already wrapped and anxiously awaiting to be opened on Christmas Day.<br /><br />ETA* Wonderful movie, the kids loved it and have asked to watch it everyday. Even though there isn't much dialogue the story line was intriguing about 2 friends looking out for each other. Great movie for all ages!
