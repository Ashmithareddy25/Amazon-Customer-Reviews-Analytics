B000YABIQ6|5.0|I came thinking this show would be quality and it was. I had read about it in GQ numerous times. The fashion, the swagger, the lifestyles; this show keeps you captivated from every angle. the acting couldn't be better and the story line is well thought out and very interesting. There is a reason this show won so many emmy's
0316069485|4.0|The Reversal has a lot to like about it -- a good plot, well-developed characters, \\"real world\\" dialogue, interesting courtroom drama, solid police investigative work, and of course, Connelly's ability to write in a style that makes the reader feel they are right there in the thick of things. The plot provides a credible rationale for lawyer Mickey Haller and Det. Harry Bosch to  share the spotlight in The Reversal. Haller accepts a one-time offer from the LA District Attorney to serve as the prosecutor to retry a case in which the conviction of a killer imprisoned for twenty-four years was reversed on the basis of DNA. Bosch (Haller's half-brother) is brought in by Haller to serve as a special investigator.<br /><br />For these reasons, I liked the book overall. With that said, however, I felt The Reversal has some serious weaknesses that kept me from liking it \\"very much\\", and resulted in my feeling this book was not one of Connelly's best. One weakness is that, unlike many other Connelly books, the level of suspense was somewhat tepid and the extent of plot twists was pretty limited compared to what I've come to expect from Connelly. But the biggest weakness to me pertained to the ending -- which left me somewhat dissatisfied due to the amount of unresolved issues (which I won't get in to so that I \\"don't give away the store\\"). Based on this ending it seems pretty likely that we know what Connelly's next book will be about.<br /><br />Of course, even an average Connelly book with flaws is better than most crime fiction books. If you're a fan of Bosch and/or Haller I think you'll be generally satisfied with The Reversal -- but I wouldn't suggest that you rush to buy it. Waiting for it to come out in paperback or taking it from the library would be my recommendation.
142311339X|4.0|the book starts out very slow.  it becomes exciting during the story.  i advise you to read the percy jackson series before reading this book.  if you liked the percy jackson series you will like this book.

B000UJ48SQ|1.0|This is not an enhanced 16/9 widescreen.  This is a horrible letterbox format.  No excuse as the film was produced wide-screen.  Just another sloppy and thoughtless Warner transfer of film to DVD in the US.  Warner has a history of sloppy transfers.

B0041YI4ZO|1.0|Riding on the coat tail of the successful Ip Man series, Ip Man 3 is your typical \\" Slap-Ip-Man-on-the-title-and-we-can-all-make-buckets-of-money\\" sort of film.      I won't be surprised if the overall plot was hashed together over a nice lunch by some studio heads,  script written in 2 days and the whole movie shot in less than 20 days.  The movie has no resemblance to its predecessors.  You want cliche? This movie got them all.    I love Ip Man 1. I like Ip Man 2.  I almost tossed Ip Man 3 into the trash after the first 10 minutes.    If you are a completest or a kung fun nut, go ahead and spend the money.  If you actually want something concrete for your hard earned money and precious time, watch Ip Man 1 or 2 again.

B003TVMIDO|2.0|The packaging and the presentation of the albums contained in this box set is impressive and beautiful to look at. The sound quality of the music on these CDs on the other hand is a major step backward.<br /><br />Stick with the Fidelity Remastered discs for the best sounding Lennon music available.
B003WTE886|5.0|With \\"Speak Now\\" Taylor Swift makes the leap into young womanhood. She's not a girl, not yet a woman, but she is growing into a more mature sound that is both refreshing and a pleasure to listen to. Unlike her two previous albums where she adopted a more country girl light sounding melody, on \\"Speak Now\\" she breaks out of this mold and sings with real emotion and a fiery temper on songs like \\"Dear John\\", \\"Better than Revenge\\", and \\"Last Kiss\\". The serious mix with the outright fun, and echoes of her last album can be found in songs like \\"Mine\\" and \\"Sparks Fly\\". Yet Swift still retains that earnest and genuine delivery in all of her songs. It's hard to resist these songs as they can be as sweet as cotton candy, but can also pack a bunch that you didn't see coming. What is most astonishing about Swift is her excellent skills at writing. Sure people say they can't believe she is so young, but that has nothing to do about. Her music and words come from the heart and that has nothing to do with age. Some of my favorite songs are the fiery \\"Dear John\\", the bittersweet \\"Never Grow Old\\" and the heartbreaking \\"Last Kiss\\". It will be interesting to see how Swift adapts and matures in the coming years, but for now \\"Speak Now\\" remains one of the best albums of any genre this year!

144471032X|5.0|Great book. Have been on Atkins before but this book kicks it up a notch.
0756405890|3.0|To me, this book is just sort of okay. It follows the classic fantasy formula (tragically orphaned boy who overcomes poverty and strife to become a hero, anyone?) and I like the classic fantasy formula, honestly, I do, but this book takes itself way too seriously.    I won't sit here and bag on Kvothe's love interest, though she is legitimately terrible, and the passages wherein he gives the preamble about \\"not being able to describe her because you've never met her\\" are the worst parts of the book.    I will tell you that there is no real plot and no type of resolution in this book. I mean, yeah, things are happening, but they are essentially meaningless. I honestly thought that by the end of this book Kvothe would have at least been kicked out of the university since that's one of the promises the back cover makes to us, but he isn't. Anything that I actually found interesting in this book was immediately passed over and we had to move on to something that I found boring.    I don't really understand the almost five star rating on this book. I would never give this book a five star review unless I had never read another fantasy novel in my life. This book is a huge cliché and any ideas you find here you will find in other books and probably done a bit better.    I do like some aspects of this book and I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time, but, to put it in terms of food, it's like eating a bag of potato chips when you're looking for Thanksgiving dinner. Basically, if you've never read a fantasy book before and you want to try one out, here is an introduction to the genre that won't blow your mind too much. If fantasy is your favorite genre, and you're hoping to find an exciting new world with fresh perspective, look elsewhere.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|SEX AND THE CITY 2, at its core, has a fairly good story and script by Michael Patrick King (with bows to Candace Bushnell and Darren Star who created the original HBO series) - issues that face older girls post marriage and menopause.  But those tidbits get buried in the embarrassingly extravagant production that reeks of misspent funds attempting to make the show a crowd pleaser.  It didn't work in the theaters and it doesn't seem to work on DVD.  It is especially sad to watch this self-indulgent film because there are some really fine actors involved.  Not only is the original quartet of high flying comediennes intact - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall. Kristin Davis - but the leftover men - David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Jason Lewis, Chris Noth, John Corbett - are also pulled into the redux, each appearing a bit tired of the attempt to update what had been a good show.<br /><br />There is no real story: after an insulting wedding of tow gay men, Samantha is invited to Abu Dhabi  for a PR swing and of course she takes her girlfriends along, each of whom is having conflicts in their marriage or mothering status. The trip simply allows for the constant costume changes that are appallingly grotesque to be shown in contrast to the social mores of the Arab Emirates (burka wearing women contrasting with the flamboyant quartet) and many lessons on how to identify the old 'ugly American' tourist.  But of course, the trip's influence on the ladies makes them appreciate what their lives are truly like in New York...la la la.<br /><br />There are very brief appearances by Liza Minnelli, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, Miley Cyrus, Tim Gunn etc that only seem to underscore the expensive budget of this Redux. If the viewer is able to get past these obstacles and hear the tiny bits of advice for women a la Carrie Bradshaw Preston's journalism, this can be an entertaining evening.  It is just not worth the final tab.  Grady Harp, October 10
031606792X|4.0|I think the reviews I've read so far are very harsh but to each their own!  So, here's my take.  I'm not a writer but I am fairly well educated and I couldn't put the book DOWN I was just so into the story that I wanted to see where it was going and what would happen next.  I seem to be very in tune with Stephanie's writing style and she hooks me in.  I would have appreciated more on supporting characters; Renee' and the Cullens, more about the honeymoon would have been good.  BUT I still think its her story to finish.  I did appreciate the details of Bella stretching and manipulating her shield in the \\"battle\\" scene.  I think leaving OUT bloodshed leaves her open to continue the story for an all out brawl when Renesme is older.  I can totally see her doing an entire series from Renesme's point of view and that would be cool.  I hope she continues the story.  I'm definitely a fan.
0312600844|1.0|I havn't finished this book yet. I tried to tell myself that it would get better. Then I poked around through these reviews and realized I am not alone. My biggest complaint is how awful the charachters are. You cannot root for anyone and you almost dont care what happens to them. Second to that is that there is no discernible change in voice. I recently read The Help. Each chapter jumps from one charachter to another. You almost dont have to read who the charachter is, but rather just the first few lines of a new chapter, and the voice in the writing is so distinct that you know right away. There is little if not any difference between Patty, Richard, Walter, Joey, ect. Im irritated that this has gotten the rave reviews it has gotten. Maybe I am not smart enough to get it. But I admit, I skim and skip paged that drag and drag just to get to something interesting. Ugh.
0500515328|4.0|This lovely book is read more as a memoir than a jewelry book. Many photos are of jewels that were destroyed or lost, so the book also act as an archive of these wonderful creations. The text is very well done but with so many Marias, Alexandras and the complicated system for russian last names, a genealogical tree or guide would have been so welcomed (next edition maybe).  If you love russian history or jewelry, a great addition for your library.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|I picked this up from the video store last weekend not expecting more than a weekend of mindless entertainment.  Man, was I wrong!  This show is outstanding!  I liked Paul's counseling style right up until he revealed his true self to Gina.  O.M.G!  I found it ironic that his behavior was exactly what made him weary of his own patients.  I have to admit that I didn't watch all of the sessions between Paul and his patients because, eventually, what I was the most fascinated by was his sessions with Gina.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel and went toe to toe with Gabriel Byrne in their scenes together.  Sometimes just her facial expressions, with NO words were right on the money.  I loved that Gina would ask the right questions to flush out the real truth from Paul as opposed to HIS truth the way he saw it and called him out on his b.s.when he'd go off on tangents.  The sessions in which his wife, Kate, participated were marvelous, insightful, and truly revealing not just of the turmoil in their relationship, but relationships in general.  Excellent, excellent series.  I look forward to watching season two sometime during a snowbound weekend this winter.
B003K025TQ|4.0|Grammy winning guitarist, Lee Ritenour, has a new release that hitchhikes on Yamaha's Six String Theory guitar playing competition to create an eclectic mix of guitar based music. When the liner notes include \\"guitar played\\" and \\"amp used\\" for each track and player - you know this release is aimed primarily toward guitar fans.    This is not a traditional Lee Ritenour record. While he's one of the producers, his guitar (or songwriting) isn't featured on every track. In fact, some of the standout tracks (my favorite, \\"fives\\" featuring new shred master Guthrie Govan, bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta) have Lee in the control booth.    This is quite an assemblage of players, some well known names like B.B. King, George Benson, Steve Lukather, and Vince Gill (to name a few) and some lesser ones all get a chance to play and show off their chops, sometimes with Lee and other times solo or in other configurations that boast a broad span of music genres.    As is the case with many superstar pairings some are great, some are not, but for fans of each particular artist - worth a listen or two. For guitar fans who can travel the road from classic gut-string, through the blues, to straight ahead jazz, then to hard rocking shred - this is the disc to have. Holds up with repeated listening. A very entertaining disc.    In his 50 years of playing guitar, Lee has proved himself a most versatile player, first as a studio player, then as a solo act, then through many collaborations with notable players through the years. Along the way he founded the modern jazz mainstay Fourplay (now featuring Larry Carlton on guitar). Quite a career for sure.    This disc highlights the many styles Lee can play, and his raucous playing on Jeff Beck's Freeway Jam (along with Mike Stern and Tomoyosu Hatei) was for me a real surprise. He really gets down!    Great disc. From Concord Music Group.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|This set is stunning when built. This a something that you will want to display. It is not one that can be played with as the pieces will come off. It was relatively easy as lego finally put like pieces together in each bag, which removes the annoyance of hunting for pieces.    Only compliant is - As with all the Star Wars legos sets, it's hard to distinguish between the gray, dark gray and black pieces in the instructions manual.     I'm looking forward to seeing Legos' next Collector's Star Wars Set.
B003L16FAE|1.0|I am not going to write a long review about the movie itself. We all know Predator is an awesome movie and most people looking to buy it will be looking at this... But AVOID the new ultimate Hunter Edition on Blu-Ray. Some idiot at fox thought it would be a good idea to use DNR to remove the film grain from the image. The result is a flat & soft image. The original Blu-Ray looks natural and detailed with film grain and all. I think when DNR is used, there should be a warning on the package. Most Blu-Ray players have a DNR feature, let the consumer decide if they want to remove the grain and not force the film purists to put up with DNR.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Well, I write this review being totally unqualified to talk about Cyndi Lauper. I even had to check I'd spelt her name right. I've never bought anything she's done, I know nothing about her. However, what I do know is that this is one of the best albums I've purchased this year. A real classic.   I know there are mixed opinions about her suitability (and credibility?) for singing the blues, but, as a serious blues fan, I think she pulls it off. It works. It's totally credible. BB King is on top form on 'Early in the Morning', marking one of his best collaborations in recent times. Jonny Lang is electric. And the other guests are heavyweight musicians, who really work well around Lauper's voice.     I only hope her hardcore `80's followers appreciate this album as much as I do. Buy this!
1401923119|5.0|I love that line from the book.<br /><br />This book explains, from a scientific perspective, the mind-body-spirit connection and its relationship with our environment.  It's not exactly a scientific work, and it isn't a book on spirituality either.<br /><br />The character of our lives is based on how we perceive it. Genes are blueprints - the environment is the contractor that reads the blueprints. We are not victims of our genes.<br />On correlation vs. causation, Dr. Lipton states it is one thing for a gene to be linked to a disease and entirely another to cause a disease. If there are exceptions to a theory, it means the theory is incorrect. But as usual, accepted scientific paradigm trumps the evidence. The result? More pharmaceuticals for treatment of \\"environmental\\" conditions.<br /><br />He makes great analogies in the section on Growth and Protection, explaining how stress affects our immune system and our growth.  The section on Conscious Parenting goes into how to create a more nurturing environment for children, but he does not explain how, as adults, we can change our core beliefs... our subconscious.  He touches on this in the Epilogue, and the websites listed are pretty informative.<br /><br />Great book!
B0028ER4QE|5.0|This is the 3rd Doors vinyl reissue I've bought, and wow, these never fail to impress.  So far, I have the self titled, Waiting for the Sun, and Morrison Hotel.  The 180 gram vinyl plays so clean, hardly a crackle or pop, and holding such a thick record is really great compared to those old flimsy ones.  Also, the record comes in a plastic sleeve, opposed to the old paper.  These are better for preventing static and keeping little flecks of paper off the vinyl.    If you're unsure about what 180 gram vinyl is , it can be summed up like this: \\"A heavier weight record is thicker and therefore allows for deeper grooves and more dynamic mastering. Since the vinyl is heavier- it is typically better for tracking. The 180 gram record is usually flatter and quieter than a regular weighted record.\\"    Here is my only complaint, and it's petty, but these vinyl reissues are not the same as the new CD reissues.  For example, in the new CD reissue of \\"Break on Through\\" Jim sings \\"She gets high\\", but the vinyl version is still the censored version.  However, that aside, if you unsure about upgrading your old Doors albums, or you're new into vinyl, these versions are the best out there.     I've tried the old 60's and 70's printings, and those just don't compare to virgin, 180 gram vinyl!
0316077054|3.0|In [[ASIN:0316077054 Beautiful Darkness]], Garcia and Stohl return to the world of Gatlin, where magic and mysterious happenings are afoot in an otherwise idyllic Southern town. Coming off the dramatic supernatural showdown on Lena's 16th birthday, Lena and Ethan are struggling to keep their relationship alive and to move forward, especially since Lena remains grief-stricken over her uncle's death. When Lena starts hanging out with Ridley and a dangerous new guy, Ethan decides to get to the truth about what's happening by traveling through the Caster tunnels underneath Gatlin. What awaits everyone is another dramatic face-off between the forces of Light and Dark, both of whom want Lena on their side.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I read [[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures]] and enjoyed it, but it left me wanting better pacing, more romance, and a less contrived ending. Unfortunately, BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS didn't provide those things. Pacing dragged for the first 250 pages. Once the pacing picked up, the book switched from being about relationships and the past to being more of a heroic quest of self-discovery for Ethan. Though this could have been interesting, it didn't mesh well with the feel of the first half. Like the previous book, I also didn't find Ethan and Lena's relationship very moving, especially given how Ethan is now treated by Lena (though there is a plot reason). Ethan's voice, while sweet, is beginning to feel less and less believable. He seemed too nice and innocent (and I like good guys, not bad boys), and he never got really angry or scared or asked questions, despite what's happening. Continuity errors also drew me out of the story. Most frustratingly, the conclusion obviously set up things for the sequel, and it did so in a way that was terribly similar to the first book. The world building and mythology felt unnecessarily complicated and too convenient this time too; instead of being able to suspend belief and immerse myself in the story, I kept stopping to notice how things were working out too easily to further the plot or to protect certain characters.<br /><br />On the positive side, this installment featured the introduction of new, likable characters like Liv and the expansion of existing ones like Link, Ridley, and even Ethan's deceased mother, who seemed to come alive as he learned more about her past. The development of the Caster and Otherworld mythology continued, including a lot of big reveals regarding each person's history and that of their families. A gripping back story for one couple in the past also added to the romance of the story.<br /><br />Though BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS didn't meet my expectations, I'm sure that those who loved the first book will love this too. In the next sequel, I hope that Garcia and Stohl pick up the pacing and move beyond their set conflict to something more dynamic to keep readers interested and engaged.ng to notice how things were working out too easily to further the plot or to protect certain characters.

B003Y8YXH6|4.0|It's been quite a while since I have reviewed an artist's work, mainly because, \\"Who In The Hell Am I To Say...Ya-Da, Ya-Da, Ya-Da\\", about someone's personal handiwork & craft?<br /><br />Many other reviewers have remarked on how they feel that Ono is simply capitalizing on her late husbands works...maybe, maybe not. For I truly feel Lennon's work should live on for the young to discover...NO doubt about that. And even if this \\"stripped-down\\" or \\"naked\\" approach to Double Fantasy, is quite a provocative endeavor to undertake...what can we say...she holds the rights, the permissions, the master session & mixdown tapes...let her do with them what she will. BUT IF I HEAR ONE MORE PERSON CLAIM that this \\"new\\" take on Double Fantasy is SO MUCH BETTER because it has been stripped of all it's SPECTOR-CANDY, SPECTOR-SHLOCK & SPECTOR-ISMS...why not pull the SPEC out of your own eye, before remarking as such! First of all, this is in no way a plug or alibi for the ill-fated producer...but let's be real...the reason why Lennon (and Harrison for that matter) \\"hired\\" him to produce their early works...because they were sure that his 'style' of production, was what THEY wanted as part of their end result, wouldn'tcha say? (BTW, Producer Jack Douglas was at the helm of D.F., not Spector.) Sure the late 70's/early 80's were knee-deep in production glue & effect...that was what those years were all about, weren't they? Having now a \\"2nd Take\\" on D.F., sure, may be a good & alternate way of listening to such the masterpiece, (I truly appreciated LET IT BE-NAKED for what it was worth) BUT PLEASE PEOPLE....having a little \\"Dissing-The-Producer-Party\\"...whoever he or she may have been...is REALLY dissing the ARTIST (in this case John Lennon) who \\"HIRED\\" such the talent, to mold, shape & help create the work at hand!<br /><br />So in the end...Double Fantasy-Original: GREAT!; Double Fantasy-Stripped Down: Also Great! ...but NEVER...NEVER \\"TAKE-THE-PLACE-OF\\"...Never.
0553805371|3.0|The book is easy to read, but deep in thought. It gets a little technical as far as understanding some laws of physics. I feel the reader must have a genuine interest in this subject matter, otherwise the book could lose the reader quickly.
B003YP7N9O|4.0|Two discs 76,79 minutes each approximately.  The remastered sound (2001 and 2010) is clean and still retains some of the warmth of the vinyl release.  The mix on this re-release seems to be a bit more even, with an overall solidity (not compression which makes most music unlistenable) behind the music.  Included is the original album, plus bonus tracks from a 1969  BBC Top Gear session plus a couple of radio spots-most in mono sound.  The second disc is live tracks ( I'm assuming it's the complete set) from Carnegie Hall in 1970.  The DVD is an audio only collection of live tracks from Carnegie Hall that mirrors those found on the second audio disc.  The bonus feature on the DVD is an interview with Ian Anderson from 2010.  The discs are snapped inside a five-fold cardboard holder.  The original \\"stand-up\\" cut-out of the group from the original vinyl release is also included-a very nice touch.  The booklet contains notes by Ian Anderson about the music, and a couple of period photos of the band.  Also included is a track list with pertinent information about the recording processes, and who played what on each track.<br /><br />In the review of the 2 CD Collector's Edition of \\"This Was\\", I mentioned that that album was my favorite Tull release.  To be honest, this album is a very close second, so for whatever it's worth, I'm trying to be as subjective as possible again.  This is the second album from JETHRO TULL, released in 1969.  It's also the first album to feature new guitarist Martin Barre, who also played occasional flute.  The blues sound found on the first album is largely absent due to Mick Abrahams' departure from the group.  While that sound can still be heard in some of Barre's solos, there was more of a folk style feeling in the band's sound now.  The rhythm section of Clive Bunker-drums, and Glenn Cornick-bass really began to assert themselves on this album, even though Cornick would be gone by the next album.  And that's a shame because this album is the first where the band begins to define what would become their own sound-something Cornick contributed to with subtle flourishes.  His combination of holding down the basic rhythm, and then stepping out front on an almost equal footing to play the melody gave the band's sound that much more depth and inventiveness.<br /><br />This album is also where Ian Anderson's (vocals/flute/guitar/balalaika/keyboards/mandolin/mouth organ/bouzouki) writing skills (sometimes very dense) began to coalesce, and with the rest of the band, they forged their own style of rock, folk, and blues.  Anderson was never a virtuoso on the flute (which he admits), but his sound (taken from jazz musician Roland Kirk), combined with his stage persona, was very engaging.  Barre gets off several great solos on this album (try \\"We Used To Know\\"), and the combination of Anderson's tired, worn voice is very effective.  The occasional use of strings (\\"Reason For Waiting\\" for example) was, at the time, a fairly new approach in rock music, but the sophisticated arrangements added real depth and feeling to the music.  It's also the first album in which the blending of acoustic and electric guitars provides a strong backdrop for Anderson's lyrics.  In that respect (except for the all out rockers) this album is similar to \\"Forever Changes\\" by LOVE.  The arrangements are admittedly harder in most cases, but on the more introspective songs the combination of sometimes dense lyrical wordplay, and the blending of guitar sounds, especially in combination with occasional strings, has that innocent, wistful folk/rock style sound and feel.<br /><br />The bonus tracks (some from the late John Peel's \\"Top Gear\\") feature a number of songs from the album (including 2 versions of \\"Living In The Past\\", one of which is the single version) and other contemporary favorites such as the instrumental \\"Bouree\\" (a concert favorite), \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"17\\", and \\"Nothing Is Easy\\".  The mono sound is slightly flat, but overall is very good.  Hearing BBC Radio tracks like \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"Fat Man\\", and \\"Nothing Is Easy\\", in live, cleaned up versions brings back the flavor of those days now long past.  And while the arrangements don't differ much from the studio versions, they're still a treat to hear.  Peel was not a fan of the band since Abrahams' leaving, and Anderson and Peel never truly connected again, which Anderson regrets, so this edition of the album is dedicated to Peel.<br /><br />The live disc from Carnegie Hall (the album \\"Living In The Past\\" has 2 tracks, \\"Dharma for One\\" and \\"Kind Permission Of\\" from this same concert) has a bit of an edge to the sound, but what it lacks in fidelity is more than made up in an immediacy and power not found in the studio versions.  Anderson's vocal inflections and forceful singing will be an eye opener for people who only know the group from their studio releases. Likewise his flute playing, which has a force and animation all it's own.  A number of tracks from \\"Stand Up\\" are featured (including a killer version of \\"Nothing Is Easy\\"), along with a few songs from the album \\"Benefit\\".  The addition of John Evan (\\"John Evan Blues Band\\") on piano helps fill out the sound of the band and give the music added depth.  His classical training is very evident, and brings a certain elevation to the arrangements, around which Anderson's flute at times, weaves in and out (\\"With You There To Help Me/By Kind Permission Of\\").  \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\" is another stand out, with both Anderson's vocal and Barre's slide guitar, along with a Bunker's drumming, at times shaking the cobwebs out of the speakers.  Along with \\"We Used To Know\\", there are a number of long tracks on this disc, which give the band time to stretch out and play, with very little (except a slightly indulgent flute/vocal display by Anderson on 1 song) wasted space.  \\"Dharma For One\\" (all 13 minutes of it) includes a long drum solo, de rigeur for the time, so fair warning, unless that's something you enjoy.  Anderson used the drum solo portion both so he and the rest of the band could catch their breath, and as a showcase for Bunker's drumming.  One track simply titled \\"Guitar Solo\\", is just that.  It begins with Barre playing some intense solo power chords, and continues with some rhythmic drumming from Bunker, who eventually plays on an equal footing with Barre.  Ian Anderson comes in on vocals to finish the song (which has morphed into \\"For A Thousand Mothers\\"), and the band brings things to a breath stealing conclusion-just when you think things are over, the band comes roaring back for a final few bars.

Listeners will have to decide whether this is just another money making venture, from an industry in trouble, or a valuable edition with real worth.

It's well worth it for the early era Tull fan or fans of 60's era English rock.ring BBC Radio tracks like \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"Fat Man\\", and \\"Nothing Is Easy\\", in live, cleaned up versions brings back the flavor of those days now long past.  And while the arrangements don't differ much from the studio versions, they're still a treat to hear.  Peel was not a fan of the band since Abrahams' leaving, and Anderson and Peel never truly connected again, which Anderson regrets, so this edition of the album is dedicated to Peel.    The live disc from Carnegie Hall (the album \\"Living In The Past\\" has 2 tracks, \\"Dharma for One\\" and \\"Kind Permission Of\\" from this same concert) has a bit of an edge to the sound, but what it lacks in fidelity is more than made up in an immediacy and power not found in the studio versions.  Anderson's vocal inflections and forceful singing will be an eye opener for people who only know the group from their studio releases. Likewise his flute playing, which has a force and animation all it's own.  A number of tracks from \\"Stand Up\\" are featured (including a killer version of \\"Nothing Is Easy\\"), along with a few songs from the album \\"Benefit\\".

B000VBIEXS|5.0|Emerson Lake and Palmer's fourth studio album entitled Brain Salad Surgery was released in December of 1973 in conjunction with another US tour taking place.<br />By 1973, Emerson Lake and Palmer rivaled The Rolling Stones, The Who and Led Zeppelin as America's biggest concert attraction and (like Zeppelin) the critics hated ELP (as well as other prog rock contemporaries Genesis, Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd). Keyboard maestro Keith Emerson, bass player/singer/guitarist/producer Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer recorded Brain Salad Surgery at Advision Studios with future Rolling Stones engineer/co-producer Chris Kimsey and Geoff Young. Would this mean ELP have their music change for better or worse, read and find out as I did when I got the CD in November, 1996).<br />The opening track \\"Jerusalem\\" which is the classic English church hymn that Parry and Blake wrote and ELP made their own. It was to be released as as single but the BBC complained. Next is the band's excellent take of Alberto Ginastera's \\"Toccata\\" is an example of the greatest honor a musical arrangement can get : the admiration of the composer. The legendary Argentinean composer Alberto Ginastera (1916-1983) once said and I quote \\"Keith Emerson has beautifully caught the mood of my piece\\", end quote. It's possible to understand better the original version of Ginastera's fourth movement of the first piano concerto after hearing BSS. Also, Carl Palmer's percussion and innovative electronic percussion solo was years ahead of its time. Next was the rejected first single from the album which was the Lake penned ballad \\"Still.... You Turn Me On\\" which is another classic Lake acoustic ballad in the vein of \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"From the Beginning\\". Then we have the hilarious \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" which tells the tale of a bouncer who thinks he is a big shot before he gets his just desserts and the lesson learned in this song is \\"THE BIGGER THEY COME THE HARDER THEY FALL\\".<br />The rest of the album is the 29 plus minute epic \\"Karn Evil 9\\" (the name comes from the word carnival). The first part of the First Impression of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is a long tense increasing in its first part, violent Hammond and synthesizer sounds, syncopated rhythms and a very wise impressing appearance of new motifs almost without notice - a skilful dealing with larger forms, culminating in a plain and somehow lighter guitar solo which ends the first part of the First Impression.<br />On the vinyl, one had to turn to Side Two to hear the First Impression's second part via fade out on the end of Side 1 and fade in at the beginning of Side 2. The first Victory Music CD Remastering engineer Joseph Palmaccio removes the fade out and joins the second section of the First Impression. In this is ELP's most famous US FM rock radio staple with the immortal lines \\"Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends\\" and \\"come and see the show\\" and excellent guitar work from Lake. The Second Impression has the band doing a jazz fusion induced jam with some synth effects to sound like Carribean steel drums. The Third Impression is the most melodic part of the piece and has very provocating lyrics (with Greg Lake's ex-King Crimson bandmate Pete Sinfield helping on lyrical contribution) and technology decry with lyrics like \\"load your program I am Yourself\\" pre-dating computer programs that now dominate one's lives. Furthermore, Keith does the voice of the computer in one of the first uses of vocoder in rock music. Also the ending is one of the wildest endings to a rock album ever.<br />Brain Salad Surgery became ELP's fifth US Top 20 album reaching #11 but sales wise is ELP's biggest US seller and the album one should start interest in ELP with (I did in 1996 and didn't look back).<br />There are a few remasters out. The first was by Victory Music in 1993 (which Sanctuary Music in the UK reissued after they controversially issued an alternate mix of the album). Then when Victory Music folded, Rhino re-released the same remaster in 1996 with a 3-D cover and interview track with ELP and Sinfield. Now there's the remaster that Shout Factory! released which is alright (I cannot tell a difference in remastering, beats the alternate mix remasters that Castle/Sanctuary put out which had an alternate mix of the album) but I do like the fact it's repackaged like the original vinyl LP.<br />Highly recommended!a 3-D cover and interview track with ELP and Sinfield. Now there's the remaster that Shout Factory! released which is alright (I cannot tell a difference in remastering, beats the alternate mix remasters that Castle/Sanctuary put out which had an alternate mix of the album) but I do like the fact it's repackaged like the original vinyl LP.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|The Beatles compilation The Beatles 1962-1966 a/k/a The Red Album was first released in April of 1973.<br />It is hard to pick the best of The Beatles' work and compile into one collection. The first attempt was in 1973 with the two double albums 1962-1966 (the review this pertains to) and The Beatles 1967-1970. Then there were attempts to put the best of The Beatles on one disc which were The Beatles 20 Greatest Hits and Beatles 1 which, in my view, pale in comparison to the Red and Blue best ofs. When the Red and Blue best-ofs came out, The Beatles had been disbanded since 1970 and its members (singer/songwriter/rhythm guitarist John Lennon, singer/songwriter/bass player Paul McCartney, singer/guitarist George Harrison and singer/drummer Ringo Starr) were now solo superstars but when they together they were responsible for changing music much more than Elvis did.<br />The first disc covers tunes from the band's first five UK albums Please Please Me (represented by \\"Love Me Do\\" and its title cut). Its followup With the Beatles is represented by \\"All My Loving\\". Plus the singles from 1963 \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" (which hit #1 in the US in 1964) are here. Then the band's first US #1 from 1964 \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is included. Then there's three songs from A Hard Days Night (which are Paul's rocking \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" (another US #1), John's rocking title cut (another US #1) and Paul's ballad \\"And I Love Her\\"). Then Beatles For Sale from late 1964 is represented by \\"Eight Days a Week\\" (another US #1). The non-album single \\"I Feel Fine\\" is also here. Then we end the first disc with two from the 1965 Help! album starting with the #1 hit \\"Ticket to Ride\\" and the classic #1 \\"Yesterday\\" (not on the original US LP of Help) which is the most covered song in music history.<br />Disc two picks up with two more from Help including its chart-topping title cut and the album track \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\". Next is the #1 double A-side single of \\"We Can Work it Out\\" (a US #1) and \\"Day Tripper\\" (a UK #1) from 1965. Then we go to the classic Beatles album Rubber Soul from 1965 (represented by John's rocker \\"Drive My Car and his folk influenced \\"Norwegian Wood\\" (which had George Harrison introduce sitar to rock music), the pop of \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"Michelle\\", the ballad \\"In My Life\\" and the folky ballad \\"Girl\\"). Then it's the rocking A-side from 1966 out of \\"Paperback Writer\\" (a US #1). Then we close with two from 1966's Revolver with Paul's \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and the Ringo sung \\"Yellow Submarine\\".<br />The Beatles 1962-66 would top out at #2 on the US charts and sell millions and is the third highest selling Beatles album in the US.<br />In 2010, the album was re-released in a newly remastered version superbly remastered at Abbey Road packaged in a digi-pak which looks similar to the original LP and also comes with a booklet with extra photos, an essay and full lyrics.

B003WTE886|4.0|Okay. First let me start out this review by stating that I'm not your typical Taylor fan. I consider her music a guilty pleasure mainly because the country-pop thing has never caught on with me, I grew up on country and like -some- pop, but Carrie Underwood's version of country is certainly FAR from my favorite. Even so Taylor's music is so catchy that almost all of her stuff appeals to me. When I downloaded Fearless from iTunes, I almost immediately bought a physical copy just in support. Having said all of that, I REALLY wanted to fall in love with this one. And I did, a little. When 'Mine' was released I was so excited, never mind that it sounded as Fearless-esque as it did, it was more of the catchyness that I've come to expect. Well, not that the rest of the album was garbage or anything like that, but in retrospect, Fearless only had 2, maybe 3 max songs that I didn't care for. \\"Speak Now\\" is almost a polar opposite for me in that only 3 to maybe 5 songs really stand out to me. Again, not that a majority of it was trash, but it was kind of a let down after reading all the positive hyped up responses on amazon. As I listened to it more I began to realize that maybe she's starting to better fit the said country-pop genre that she's going for, and maybe that was the reason why I wasn't as impressed by it. To her credit, I do believe this album is a step forward originality wise and vocally. The only tracks that I got deja vu thinking about previous albums were as I said before 'Mine' and I thought 'Live On' sounded like a sequel to Fearless' 'Change.' Something I disagree with other reviewers is on the track 'Last Kiss.' A lot of people are saying it's a weak song, but that was one of my favorites. I think that's completely based off of what kind of music you like, it's something you'd like if you enjoy ballads.  Other songs I enjoyed are 'Enchanted' and 'Back to December.' 'Better than Revenge's chorus gave me a laugh and the track itself was enjoyable, but thelyrics sounded heavily inspired by Paramore's 'Business of Misery' (seriously, if you like this song go find Paramore's version, it's just as wonderfully, if not more, blunt). Not necessarily a bad thing, I went through a Paramore phase myself. Contrarily, 'Dear John,' something many loved and I thought I'd enjoy myself, literally made my face scrunch up with semi-disgust. It sounded like whining to me. I know a lot of people are like wow someone actually dissed J-May and called him out... etc etc.. but you don't go after someone who's a -known- player and expect the happy ending. At 19, that's something even I would have known better than to persue and I don't really have any sympathy for her towards that. Perhaps it's one of those songs that will grow on me, but I won't hold my breath. At any rate, I know this all sounds like a negative review, but even though a lot of these songs are lackluster to me, \\"Speak Now\\" is a pretty great album vices included. It's something that the listener has to decide on for themselves, so don't get your hopes up.. but don't completely discard any chances of liking it either because you might be missing something fantastic. Miss Swift still continues to present material that is originally Taylor without having to resolve to the desperate measures that many artists today use (Ex: skimpy clothes, immoral lyrics). So I still respect and support her simply for being the role model that she is for the younger girls that enjoy her so much :)
1400032717|5.0|Storylines following the lives of autistic individuals rarely delve into the lived experience of autism instead choosing to deal with the condition through a sort of societal-normalized reflection told through their interactions with others.  Author Mark Haddon breaks this norm from the opening sentences of \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\".  The reader is placed into the mind of Christopher, a 15-year old autistic teen with a compelling mysterious to solve regarding the gory death of a neighbor's dog.  Haddon leaves very little to the imagination as Christopher tells his own story through a largely coherent stream of consciousness narrative.<br /><br />Christopher explores the world around him searching for clues in the death of Wellington, the obvious victim of fowl-play, who Christopher found dead in the early morning hours impaled by a pitchfork.  Christopher squirms around his father's admonishments to leave the situation alone continuing to press his neighbors for clues and information.  In the midst of this investigation , Christopher recounts his narrative process as he explains his desire to make his story available to the world.<br /><br />As Christopher follows the twist and turns of a mystery that leads him along an emotionally tumultuous journey, the reader gains an oft-painful insight into what the world looks like to an individual with autism.  Christopher struggles to deal with a perplexing world around him, while confronting the difficulties of a society that is equally perplexed by him.  His familial relationships are a recurrent theme that underlies the mystery of Wellington's death and ultimately Christopher ends up with more questions about his own life than he does about the end of Wellington's.<br /><br />An interesting all around read.  The story wraps issues surrounding the difficulties of autism within a well-written story and captivating plot.

B003VIW8DK|5.0|I've been listening to Bryan Ferry since I bought For Your Pleasure on vinyl in the 1973.  I think some of the reviewers miss the point.  This is not Roxy Music circa 1973.  This is an absolutely beautiful record.  Reason or Rhyme and Me Oh My are two his very best songs in years.  This is his best solo record since The Bride Stripped Bare.  The production values on this record are stunning.  It's one of the most complex headphone listening records I own.  Admittedly you will get more out of this record on a very good stereo or listening to it through a high quality set of headphones.  I'm not sure this is Ipod music.  Highly recommended but not for people on a nostalgia trip or can't stand an artist who doesn't repeat the same thing he did 35 years ago.  In comparison to a lot of artists who I listened to in the 70's Bryan Ferry still sounds like he actually enjoys what he does.  I can't say the same thing for David Bowie or the Rolling Stones to name two.  Interesting enough, I played this for some younger people (in their 20's) who had no idea who Bryan Ferry was.  They loved it.  They were quite surprised when I told them how old he was.  Bryan Ferry and Nick Cave are proof positive that rock can still be relevant when played by 50+ year olds.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Got these on a recommendation from a friend, he said they are an industry standard and he and many people he's known have owned theirs for many years.  He himself said he's had his for 10 years, and as you'll see it's not uncommon for people to say they have had them for that long.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />Freaking sweet!  I guess I didn't expect much for headphones but it comes in a pretty nice box, solidly packaged.  It was sitting on top of some ruffled silver cloth, looked great. Includes headphones, large jack connector (not sure what it's called) and warranty info / disassembly instructions.<br /><br />Build:<br />These things are built like a rock.  They are also beautiful.  Just looking at the screws and the stitching of the leather on the headband I'm highly impressed.<br /><br />Fit:<br />This is a point I docked a point, maybe I just have a big head or ears.  The first day I wore them my ears got a little sore, they aren't real tight mind you, but probably a result of me being an ear-bud style kind of guy for so long.<br /><br />Audio:<br />Look I'm no audiophile, but man can these pump! I never knew what I was really missing musically.  I've discovered so many new things in the music I listen to.  The base isn't overwhelming but it's nice.  Have you ever been in a car with wayyyyy too much base to the point you couldn't hear the actual music?  I have, and hate that.  If you're looking for extreme base well, go put some subs in your car!  These like any good headphone will excel when connected to a better audio device, like a headphone amp, or a good computer sound card (and yes you can tell a HUGE difference).  I had these hooked up to a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic Card (a midrange sound card) and there was a huge difference from on board computer audio (heck my headphones where noticeably shaking).  I'm now getting a top of the line ASUS card that has a built in headphone amp and expect even larger gains.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />Onrecommendation from a friend I got different earpads.  I got the velour earpads meant for the Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280  from [ ... ], you can actually find the link to it right here on Amazon by searching for \\"Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280 Replacement Earpads Headphones\\".  At the time of writing they are about [ ... ] shipped.  They have a larger ear opening.  I've seen others say that their ears can sweat when wearing the stock ones for a long time, but these are great and won't stick to your face so check those out.<br /><br />These leak sound a little, it's not terrible but keep that in mind if your looking for a pair of headphones that won't leak at all these are not it.<br /><br />I will update when the new audio card comes in next week.

Neither of the Kranks particularly enjoys the holidays due to crassness and the frenzies of late shopping amidst a horde.  They agree to Skipping Christmas this year by going on ten day cruise with the money they didn't spend on the holiday.<br /><br />They ignore charities and their neighbors who insist the lights and Frosty must go up.  This year, they will be dining on a luxury ship rather than hosting a gala as they have done for years.  However, the Kranks are about to learn an American lesson when it comes to Skipping Christmas as plans of mice and bah humbugs often go astray in late December.<br /><br />This is a lighthearted entertaining reprint of John Grisham's satirizing a capitalist Christmas.  The story line is fun, but not anywhere near the excitement of the author's legal thrillers.  Still with a eggnog nod to It's A Wonderful Life, fans who enjoy a warm holiday stocking yarn will want to learn how hard it is to simply skip Christmas.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this because of all the positive reviews and also because I figured I could find the 20 or so minutes a day it takes to do this and wanted to improve my health. Looking more fit would be a plus. A little about my situation. I'm a 48 year old female and work a graveyard job for the Postal Service that is very manual labor intensive. Pushing 700+ lb. containers and constant lifting of heavy packages and tubs of magazines. I just didn't have the energy to even think about any more physical activity when I got home. Just wanted to sleep and eat! A majority of my co-workers including myself are overweight and gaining. A high percentage being morbidly obese too. Many with weight related health problems. I didn't want to head that way. I am only 5ft tall, so a little extra weight really shows on my body. Most of it I gain in my midsection. I started this at 128.5 lbs. I and figured I would be able to try this for 30 days. I could handle 20 minutes. No excuses. Well, I am glad I did! Just finished the 30 days. I'm weighing in at 116.5. Total of 12lbs lost and measuring 4 inches smaller at my waist. Gaining some tone in my muscles too. My goal is 110 lbs. and I can see it in the horizon. I have much more energy and really feel better about myself and look forward to continuing this! Stayed on Level 1 for awhile because I was completely sedentary and way out of shape. Finally up to Level 2. I did watch my calorie intake. Eating healthy, small meals throughout the day, and not feeling hungry. When I started to pay attention to the calories, I was amazed at how much I was consuming. No more frequent trips to In-and-Out Burgers for instance, an easy 1000 calories! Basically this changed my life and am motivated to keeping it up.

1400079144|1.0|I managed to finish the book only because I figured out pretty early which parts to skim: the pseudoscience, the ridiculously flat character development.  Unfortunately, even though that was most of the book, there were still huge eye-rollers I managed to stumble on.  Descriptions of Langdon's \\"physique?\\"  the only female character collapsing in his arms so many times?  the villain's \\"massive organ?\\"  Come ON.    There were two or three really interesting parts, like the cat-and-mouse chase in the dark with the ethanol trick.  But all in all, not worth the few hours of my life I wasted on this book, especially because the author's misinformation was sometimes so blatant that it insulted my intelligence.  The \\"fontanel\\" described in the book as the sacred place on the top of the head, where the bones are not fused at birth, where the villain wants to tattoo something?  It's not there.  There are two, at front and back of the head, the posterior fontanel and the anterior fontanel.      That error made me lose all interest in whatever \\"scientific\\" or philosophical information the book held.  Boo.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Alternative title for this review:  \\"Six Stars' Worth of Excellence\\"    If you thought progressive rock was dead, think again.  The Mars Volta, and this album specifically, are for real.  I say this as a dedicated, old-school fan of Yes, King Crimson, Pink Floyd Genesis (pre-Abacab), Rush (pre-Permanent Waves), Marillion, etc.    The Mars Volta started out in El Paso, TX; according to Wikipedia, they're based out of Mexico these days.  The album has this undercurrent of...I dunno...\\"on-the-border-ness\\" to it, where you feel like you're in two places at once, but are in fact in neither of them.  Hard to explain, but that's how it feels anyway...mysterious, majestic, and somewhat menacing all at once.    The lyrics on this album are about 15% Spanish and 85% English, but all of it is mind-bending gibberish.  Just like vintage King Crimson, in other words - it's all good, for those who want to open up their minds and soak it in.  The tracks are extra-long and jam-oriented, and they fade into one another nicely.  This means you can approach this album as one continuous piece of music, and it's very effective as such.    On this album, Cedric the vocalist is superb.  Very melodic and on-pitch...there are echoes of Robert Plant in his delivery.  On later TMV albums, he'd sing in a high/squeaky (and frankly annoying) falsetto tone, but on this album, he does everything 110% correctly.    Omar is the other half of the band - guitarist, composer, and bandleader.  The guy can shred, and yes, he does sound a little like Robert Fripp in places, with the staccato bursts here and there.  He's put together a musical masterpiece on this album - composition-wise, this music takes you to another place.    Together with top-notch handpicked musicians (and lots of them), TMV have produced a truly mindbending trip.  If you've ever enjoyed Larks' Tongues in Aspic by King Crimson...if you love to trip out with Relayer by Yes, get Frances the Mute right now.  You won't regret it.  You might not like their later stuff as much (I don't), but this album is solid gold.
0321687299|4.0|This book provides a good overview of the newer technologies of HTML 5.  There are parts that are glossed over where I would have appreciated the ability to see the javascript code that was being discussed.  It almost seemed like he didn't want to give up his secret code that he'd slaved over.    I'm an experienced HTML developer and a mediocre javascript, so the more javascript examples there are, the better for me.  If you want to keep up with the latest trends but don't need a reference book, this would be a good option.  The authors seemed to place a priority on accessibility concerns, while this is laudable, I believe some of that space could have been used for more code or depth.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|Big fan of The Killers and really enjoyed this album. Wish I could make it to one of his concerts, because his is just as good live as he is on his albums.
0307341577|5.0|I really liked Sharp Objects. This book blows it away. You really just don't read fiction like this regularly. There are a lot of schlubs writing books out here that can't even touch a book like this. The best reviews on Amazon are the ones that don't go on about the prose etc and blah, blah blah. You long winded morons make me sick and I hope you find my review not helpful. This book is haunting and so good. I think Gillian has many demons and may she continue to enthrall us.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Seriously, I lost five pounds in the first six days of Jillian Michaels \\"30 Day Shred\\" DVD. My husband is already shifting his fat to muscle - I can see the difference. Jillian says to do the best you can and we have only tried Level One which is 20 minutes. We were dying the first 2 days during the workout and were sore and very tired afterwards but always felt good the next day so we did it again. My thighs feel different and I can get my zippers up easier. When Jillian says that 400 pound people can do the workout we couldn't possibly quit! We intend to continue all 30 days because we know we can.  We need to lose the weight and get into shape!  We are tired of being overweight, out-of-shape senior citizens!  What a motivating trainer she is! Highly recommended.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I love this collection. The original is excellent, and now these other mixes/versions just add to the joy.
B002ZG98ZA|2.0|I'd seen the movie in the theater when it came out and it was OK, but there is something wrong with the DVDs soundtrack, it winds up lagging noticeable behind about 1/3rd into the movie (so that when Carrie slams down her magazine its several seconds before you hear it being slammed down).  I haven't be able to watch the blu-ray version, hopefully that one doesn't have the same issue.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a beautiful film to own.  Screenwriter Nick Dear stayed close to Jane Austen's wonderful book.  Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds lead an extraordinary cast of excellent actors.  The lighting of the night time indoor scenes is nicely done, suggesting soft, dim candle light.  The cinematography is exquisite.  The film begins with a view of Admiral Croft being rowed out to his ship by the men of his crew, intercut with a view of Mr. Shepherd, Sir Walter Elliot's agent, on his way to Kellynch Hall with his daughter, Mrs. Clay, to discuss renting Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft with Sir Walter.  Neither of these segments are in the novel, but cutting back and forth between them sets up the eventual meeting with Mr. Shepherd and Sir Walter when Sir Walter agrees to lease Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft.  Great film making.  Another example.  At Lyme, in the foreground of the long shot of the Musgroves, Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth taking a walk along the sea wall is a table at which several women are at work cleaning fish.  Definitely not in the novel, but it's great cinema, because it sets up the long shot of the walk along the sea wall very nicely.  This is a beautiful film that you can watch repeatedly and see something new each time.
1400079144|3.0|The first quarter or so of this book seemed pretty entertaining, & hinted at a truly dark, sinister, ominous plot against America.    By roughly the halfway mark, I was beginning to feel as if all of the myriad historical explanations were there for the sake of being there -- sort of a \\"show off\\" of historical knowledge, so to speak.    When I found out what the \\"dire national security crisis\\" was, I had two reactions. The first was, \\"You're kidding, right? Who the heck would care so much about THAT???\\" My second reaction was, \\"Wait a minute ... just how did the CIA find out about this to begin with???\\"    The denouement from that point on was dull, page-skipping thriller-fare. The final ending provoked no sense of wonderment or fascination, at least not for me. The Noetics Science subplot was left hanging, unresolved & \\"out there\\", perhaps for a future book to exploit, but because of that seemed like a gigantic waste of page space & a great deal of padding, particularly considering that it was never fully explained why it was a threat to the villain's plot. The villain's true identity, when exposed, left me unconvinced as well.    IMO, Steve Berry is entirely superior to Dan Brown.
0307454541|2.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson is a novel about a journalist's reluctant quest to solve an old murder mystery for a new client.  This first book, in a series of three novels, provides tumultuous plot twists and suspense in order to keep the reader guessing throughout the developing plot.  While the book is well-written and extremely thought provoking, it is not a book for everyone.  In some sections of the story, Larson provides too many mundane details about insignificant moments, such as the exact breakfast a character ate one morning.  In addition, while the plot usually progressed nicely, too many moments throughout the book remained stagnant for too long, which causes a certain level of boredom for the reader.  If a reader demands incessant action and movement throughout the storyline, then this would not be an appropriate reading choice for him/her.

0316077054|4.0|I loved Beautiful Creatures. I loved the huge fantasy world that Garcia and Stohl created. I loved the slow, meandering Southern Gothic style. I loved that it was told from a guy's point of view. I loved the unique paranormal creations - I've never read about witches or vampires/demons like these. Beautiful Darkness starts out just where Beautiful Creatures finished and continues with the wonderfulness.<br /><br />The Caster world only becomes more complicated in the second book. Ethan is thrust further into the fantasy world as Lena as pulling away from him. Luckily, even if he doesn't have Lena, he has his trusty sidekick Link and a new, young, pretty keeper-in-training named Liv. Lena is haunted by Macon's death and this new burden to choose between light and dark at the cost of her family. In handling her grief, she has essentially abandoned Ethan and taken up with a new creature named John, who seems like an Incubus but has a caster's green eyes. Visions are coming to Ethan alone now - about Macon's past. It's up to Ethan to discover whatever Macon wanted him to know and save Lena. I continue to love Ethan. He's the guy every girls wants. Kind, gentle, and thoughtful without being too emo.  It's nice reading a paranormal romance where the narrator isn't a lovesick girl. Even at the height of Ethan and Lena's troubles, he doesn't seem mopey. Lena on the other hand, is very emo. But the darkness in her character is so strong that her struggles and worries seem interesting rather than overdone.<br /><br />Even though the pace of the book is slow, there are so many twists and turns that it never gets boring. All the characters from the first book play a role in Beautiful Darkness along with new ones. I loved learning more about the Caster world, especially the tunnels. I realized that Amma is even smarter and more powerful than I assumed from the first book. And the connection between Ethan's family and the caster world just grows more complicated as Ethan learns more about the past and the present.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness took me awhile to get into. I enjoyed it the whole time, but I was rather confused at first. The book gets right into new content rather than spending the first 50 pages summarizing the previous book. It was refreshing not to read a regurgitated plot, but I also had to go back and almost re-read Beautiful Creatures, because I'd forgotten so much and the new book didn't bring me up to speed. On the whole, I prefer having to go back to the first book over wasting words with summarization in the second book.<br /><br />The only other big complaint I have with this book comes right at the end. A huge plot twist felt like it was handled too casually, like it just wasn't that big of a deal. This is going to be a huge part of the third book (at least I presume so) and I am so excited for it; it's a great twist. I just wish it had been introduced better.<br /><br />Overall, Beautiful Darkness was a great addition to the Caster Chronicles. If you liked Beautiful Creatures, you'll definitely like this one. And by the end, you'll be dying for the third book to come out.<br /><br />Rating: 4 / 5st and the present.    Beautiful Darkness took me awhile to get into.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's 3rd studioalbum Continuum is without doubt his best work to date. No matter how great they are, his other albums do not even come close to the masterwork Continuum is.<br />It's  also the first record John co-produced with Steve Jordan. Is there anything this multi-talent can't do?<br />John's songwriting progressed a lot since Heavier Things and the result is even more beautiful (Dreaming With A Broken Heart), edgier (Belief) en sensitive (I'm Gonna Find Another You) than his earlier efforts.<br />Many people will recognize themselves in the social Waiting On The World To Change. Mayer takes a real risk with the Jimi Hendrix cover Bold As Love, plays with country influences on The Heart of Life and that guitarsolo on In Repair... Well, you just have to experience it.<br />But also songs as Stop This Train (which became my personal anthem), I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You), Slow Dancing In A Burning Room en fan favorite Gravity are pure goldmines.<br />Vultures is my least favorite song on this record, but that doesn't mean it's a bad one.<br />John Mayer's Continuum, with it's strong jazz and blues influences, is a pure masterpiece that came right from his unbelievable talented heart and will go straight into yours!
B003HE2B6C|5.0|Other reviewers have said it better, but I just want to throw in my 2 cents that this is Hanson's best album to date. They have developed so much as musicians over the years, and I love this result. It's mostly pop, but the brass instruments and jazzy piano put a soulful, bluesy kick to it that puts it above the rest. Every single song is good, I don't skip a single track. Really fun to dance to, also.
0312370849|4.0|Tatiana Rosnay tells the horrifying and tragic story of the round up of the Jews in France. Sarah and her family are arrested simply because they are Jewish. It is yet another powerful story of the awful Holocaust during World War II. The pain of what man did to his fellow man--especially children will hopefully never fail to move people to strong emotion. Rosnay is successful because of her fresh look at an oft-hidden event in the history of France.<br /><br />With the story of Sarah, Rosnay interweaves the story of Julia, an American journalist married and living in France. Julia discovers that the apartment where she will move was once the home of Sarah. As she researches more about Sarah and her family, Julia gains the strength to stand up for herself. Rosnay dares to have an honest discussion about abortion and I think there are interesting parallels between the Holocaust--the senseless slaughter of millions of people and the epidemic number of abortions--the murder of innocent unborn children. Bravo to Rosnay.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|I just rec'd this blu-ray anthology and the visual and audio quality is excellent.  However, as has already been mentioned, some players are having problems with the director's cuts.  The director introduces his re-cut version and then it starts, but my Oppo player doesn't get the right information to start the film and the picture is grossly zoomed in -- showing only about a quarter of the whole.  My solution was to jump to the scene selection area and start the film just after the intro and the titles, which worked.<br /><br />My Oppo was about $500 and was highly reviewed. Also, I have all the latest firmware updates.  It is apparent that most of you do not have this problem, so maybe Oppo needs another update though I have a fairly large blu-ray collection and everything has played perfectly until I received this set.<br /><br />If you're an Alien fan, this is a great set.  And, I hope you avoid the problems I'm having.  Good luck!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|No matter what John Mayer would have released, it couldn't have been better than the perfect Continuum album from 2006.<br />Yes, Mayers fourth studioalbum sounds great, but after heaving heard the whole record several times, I had to admit that it all sounds to mainstream. But according to a promotion interview John did for Battle Studies, that's exactly the sound he wanted.<br />Off course the man created some typical John Mayer controversy with it's first single Who Says. The song opens with the line 'who says I can't get stoned?'. But according to John it's not about drugs at all, it's a metaphore. Well, true or not, it's a great metaphore and a great song.<br />So is Heartbreak Warfare (supposedly about his relationship with Jennifer Aniston), All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye, Perfectly Lonely, War Of My Life, Do You Know Me and Friends, Lovers or Nothing (which melody reminds me a lot of The Beatles in a way).<br />So many good songs, but I still feel like something's missing. I guess it's the lack of surprises that Continuum gave us. On the other hand, I would have hated a Continuum part II. It's very easy to release a follow up to a succesfull record. It's not so easy to come up with something completely different. And I can only figure how hard it must have been for John to come up with a new record after that masterpiece.<br />But don't get me wrong here, Battle Studies is a beautiful record that deserves every bit of attention.<br />John Mayer is one of the best artists of our time! I for one can't wait for his next album.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|This is not the story of RobinHood, this is a prequel to RobinHood and the story of Robin Longstride, and a ho-hum story at best.
B00429MLZM|5.0|I really enjoyed this and would recommend this to any of my friends.  I'm surprised this never hit the theators; it was worth the price of a movie ticket.

The film looks great, interesting story, great battle scenes, excelent acting...what more do you need?
0525951652|4.0|Although the general reception has been poor, the book is interesting for those of you who like historical fiction.  Follett has tried to do a lot and as a result the characters are somewhat flat; however, he has done a good job of giving an accurate flavor of the times!
0061801313|5.0|Most of you have probably watched the show on ABC Family but I have to say you will enjoy the books so much more. I think personally with all the detail that is written in each and every 4 books, you get to see at all aspects of what each girl is going through.<br /><br />As for the first book - You get to meet each of the girls and get to know who they all are individually and its great to meet each and every one of them to see how different they have become since their very close and dear friend Alison's dissapearance. The book starts out a little slow and then it starts to pick up more when it comes to discovering Ally's body. All the girls get together and talk about her but are never really all that close since each of them has changed so much through the years.  Aria moves back to Rosewood and isn't to thrilled about it due to her father's affairs and Alison's disappearance but she meets this handsome english teacher and her life all it seems to be different. As for Hanna, she becomes what Ally was; THE QUEEN BITCH and is on top of the world with her bestfriend Mona in which they both had lost tons of weight and revampped themselves as girls that everyone wants to be and be friends with.<br /><br />Emily is this sweet and loving girl who has a huge secret about herself hidden in her that is wanting to break out but the fears of what people think of her is what is holding her back but things happen and things change for her and as for the brillant Spencer; shes on the verge of something and no one knows where it is going.<br /><br />All the girls become closer in each book trying to figure out who is secretly sending them and their family about secrets on A knew but somehow they kept thinking that the body that was found was not A it had to be her but all in all someone is playing bad tricks on them and its making them all question who is really the killer and who would really want Alison dead and why??
0307474712|4.0|It seems like an exericse, a gimmick, but it's actually anything but.  To tell the story of the relationship of Dexter and Emma, author David Nicholls checks in on them once a year on the same day - all action is confined to the same day in each calendar year for two decades.  And if that sounds confining, you will be as delighted and surprised as I was to find how liberating the structure actually is, and how joyous and heartbreaking Dex and Em's story is.  Nicholls writes with such cheeky ease that you are constantly taken by surprise when you encounter, time and time again, his deeply true and insightful observations about not only his two protagonists, but all of us; because this is the story of what it's like to be 20, then 30, then 40; this is the story of what it's like to find all of that out when all you want to do is talk to one other person on the planet about it; this is that story, and if you think you've read it before, ONE DAY proves that you haven't.  So get to it.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|I was a bit taken aback when I first heard Adrian Brody was going to star in an icky bug movie. I expected him to be in more mundane Oscar type fare, but I guess everyone has to pay the mortgage.<br /><br />As it turns out, I was quite surprised at how this movie played out. There were plenty of good icky bug moments. However, as the two scientists dug a deeper and deeper hole for themselves, it was a bit too obvious what would eventually happen. And the revelation about what was in the creature's DNA was not a big surprise either. Dren (the main icky bug) started kind of creepy but became cuddly and even pseudo-erotic as the movie progressed. There was a big clue to what would happen though, when the two blob icky bugs were put on display at a big company presentation. Anyway, suffice to say the icky bug didn't stay nice.<br /><br />The ending was okay but not quite what I expected. Then again, it could have been much worse, so I'll give the movie points for that.<br /><br />All in all, it was a flawed but halfway decent icky bug. Probably not for every fan, but I'd still recommend it.

0312600844|2.0|I was watching Oprah the day she announced this book and she said it might be the best book I ever read.  I've never bought a Oprah Book Club selection before but hearing that made me decide maybe I should--this being the last season and all.  For me, this book has not been a page turner or something that I pick up and read for hours into the night because I can't put it down.  I'm finding it very hard to get past chapter two.  It's not the worst book I've ever not read, but it so far is not standing up to all the hype.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Somehow I missed this when it was released in 2008. I ran across it on iTunes and given DS was a big fixture of my junior high and high school years, I had to check it out. Wow. It is an excellent album. (Yes, I still call them that.) Maybe not groundbreaking, the way so many critics seemed to try to push her to be ... I guess because her voice is so unique and wonderful. But it is a superb album, with no filler. The songs often have a dance club feel but they never cross over into the BOM BOM BOM annoying sound of most club music. Her voice? Even better. I am loving how a number of great vocal artists are bucking the trend of old and tired and seem to be working at the peak of their powers. (Robert Plant is #1 here - again, wow.) Summer sounds terrific here. I loved the melancholy yet driving mood of many tracks. 'Late Night' music, I call it. What a pleasurable experience. I have no idea how CRAYONS sold... anyone? I hope she gets back in the studio again soon.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Everything about this set is amazing. The HD transfers of the films are absolutely stunning. Natrually the second two are more visually impressive being that they had a larger budget and were shot in HD. If it wasn't enough to have the HD transfers and all the DVD features included and upgraded as well, you get The Animatrix which is also upgraded to 1080p HD and animation has never looked sexier. There are also brand new special features inluded with this which inlude \\"Making Of\\" features for all the episodes. Tired yet? Well you better not be because you're no where near done exploring this set. The sixth disc included is really two as its a duel sided \\"Side A, Side B\\" disc which features on one side an extremely in depth look at the pschycology and philosophy of The Matrix. The other side is a nearly two-hour long \\"fly on the wall\\" style documentary covering the making of the final two chapters in he triology. However its runtime actually well over four hours as practically every fifteen seconds a rabbit appears on screen o take you to a sub-section documentary which goes even more in depth on the the specific section you are watching. So for example when the section covering the freeway chase from Reloaded is on the rabbit appears to take you to interviews with Pope (the DP) Gatea (the visual effects guy) and numerous othrs including actors and other crew. Specific sections you will want to hear more about is the reaction to the death of Alliah, Gloria Foster and how the movie was set to shoot on September 11, 2001 and the cast and crew reaction to being overseas during the terroist attacks of that day.<br /><br />It's a truely fascinating and amazing Blu-Ray set and the makers clearly exhausted the entire Matrix archive collection. If there is anything you ever wanted to know about The Matrix it's on this set, from costumes to music to how people felt about the movie to the type of food they ate while shooting the flick, The Ultimate Matrix Collection on Blu-Ray is a must for anybody who loves movies. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!ust for anybody who loves movies. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!
0439023521|5.0|Once i picked this book up i couldn't put it down!! The whole story made me actually feel like i was there!! The action created vivid pictures in your head and the whole love affair made you want more. A awsome book that teaches you the true meaning of the word determination. You didn't want this to end and it leaves you craving for more. An action, romantic, and dramatic read that you won't want to miss out on.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|This concert film was made in 1972 during the Stones' North American Tour, in support of \\"Exile On Main St.\\" It was filmed on 16mm cameras, using the existing stage lights. In other words, it does not in any way visually resemble the modern day concert film.     Nowadays there are high definition video cameras covering every single inch of the stage, from the most optimal angles. The cameras can run uninterrupted for the entire show.  They aren't going to have film jam in the magazine. In fact, they don't have magazines (which, with 16mm film, only have about 10 minutes or so per reel before needing to be changed).      This concert is grainy and sometimes out of focus, with limited coverage of most of the band (outside of Mick Jagger). And regardless of all that - it is a glorious document of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band during a time when they truly had earned that title.     Want to see why Jagger is one of (if not THE) ultimate frontman of all time? See \\"Ladies & Gentleman...\\" Want to hear extensive lead lines from the most technically accomplished guitarist the Stones ever had (Mick Taylor)? Again, this is your film. Want to see a full concert with original Stones bassist Bill Wyman?  No slight on Darryl Jones, who is a very skilled musician and has never been acknowledged as an \\"official member\\" of the band despite over a decade and a half of service - but again, get this release if you want to see the man who created the original basslines.    In other words, this is the antidote to anyone under the impression that the Stones are a bunch of geezers who go through the motions (which you wouldn't be blamed for, given the last twenty years or so of the band as \\"nostalgia/oldies act\\").  This was made when they were at the best.  Oh - and you get to hear Mick join Keith for vocals on \\"Happy\\"!
B001SN78JO|4.0|Jim and Zoey make a great team in this movie - while Jim is his usualy goofy slap-stick self through many parts Zoey creates a nice balance and brings some real-life to the story.  It's a feel-good fun story that makes you want to go out and say 'yes!' to life (within reason, of course).
0142405787|4.0|Do you like action and adventure? If you do you have to read Scorpia. It is one of the Alex Rider books and they are all amazing. Anthony Horowitz writes amazing books that are about a 14 year old kid who gets forced into joining a spy agency after his uncle's death. Alex never wanted to join the spy agency but every time MI6 are able to manipulate Alex into going on a mission.   Alex Rider works for the MI6 spy agency but as he is on a mission he has to encounter the group of people who supposedly killed his parents. Over there they tell him that his dad used to work with them and make him join their team. They also send him over to kill Mrs. Jones the head of MI6 operations. Alex's mind is filled with hatred for MI6 and currently the last thing he will do is refuse to killing anyone who is part of MI6. When Alex is face to face with Mrs. Jones he with a weapon and she helpless his mind fills with thought. To find out what happens to Mrs. Jones read this book.   I thought that this book was filled with adventure and it had a lot to say about how Alex felt about the situations and gives a lot of information about Alex's parents and how they died. This is actually the 5th book in the series but it might be a good one to start with since it gives you a lot of background information about Alex's past life. I really enjoy these books but if you do not like adventure and action then you might not enjoy this book to much. If you do then you will love these books just like me.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! It is so wonderfully creative and shocking. Just when you think everything is going to be okay another problem comes up. This book can teach you new lessons in life and can change your perspective of how people lived back then during the holocaust. I couldn't put this book down and at the end it literally made me cry. This is a book you will not want to miss out on.
078322947X|5.0|I just watched THE WAGES OF FEAR on BLU-RAY and must admit though it was very good, I still don't see how people can say it was better than William Friedkin's 1977 SORCERER. Friedkin added all of the elements of WAGES into his film and more, such as: The dubius backgrounds of the four men who are trapped in the God-forsaken South American country, how they ended up there, and how they must now find a way out by any means possible, even if it's driving two broken-down trucks filled with unstable nitroglycerine across 218 miles of rugged terrain, not knowing who they can trust.     Their desperation leads us to understand why they would volunteer and accept this suicide mission; If they want their lives and loved ones back, THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO, a plot point that is lacking from THE WAGES OF FEAR.     Both films boast a great international cast, great location shooting, and tough, no-nonsense, tight, gritty direction from two great film directors who are themselves the stars of their films.     With THE WAGES OF FEAR you get:  A great intense original story, filmed in glorious black and white and presented in it's original  aspect ratio of 1.37:1, the standard at the time(1953), and presented by Criterion in pristine condition with plenty of extra's. You get real explosions (no special effects here), a white knuckle ride, Spectacular cleavage shots of the lovely Vera Clouzot, a shock ending, and you get to see Yves Montand go from French singing star, to leading man status all in one film due to Henri-Georges Clouzet's guidence and masterfull direction.     With SORCERER you get:   A great re-telling of a great story, told coldly, harshly, with real explosions (no special effects here), more intensity, more scope, more violence, color, Roy Scheider, Tangerine Dream, Mafia, Bandido's, a haunting ending, all by the man who brought you THE EXORCIST, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.. What's not to like?    Roger Ebert named SORCERER one of the ten best movies of 1977.     A BUDGET OF 22 MILLION, IT EARNED AN ESTIMATED 12 MILLION  This film had the unfortunate luck of being released less than one month after the first STAR WARS movie was released, while the country was still buzzing over ROCKY, which may have led to SORCERER's  box office disappointment.  Another reason was that many critics unfairly panned SORCERER probably because of Friedkin's audacity to recreate a classic (apparently a no-no at the time), which is funny in this day and age of remakes and re-imaginings. At any rate, this film is now much more accepted and appreciated among critics, garnering an 80 percent approval rating at ROTTENTOMATOES.COM.     WIDESCREEN/ FULLSCREEN  My problem is that SORCERER was filmed (according to the Internet Movie Database) in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and NOT the 1.33:1 pan & scan DVD version available today. As of this date (June of 2010) HIGH-DEF DIGEST has listed SORCERER on their docket of films to be released on Blu-Ray, however, they give no date, or even year, so, I will continue to wait patiently for the Blu-ray.     FYI; 2012 marks the 35 anniversary of SORCERER.    But if you want my opinion on which to buy; collect both. They're both great films. The Criterion edition of THE WAGES OF FEAR on Blu-Ray is excellent, but definatly wait for SORCERER to be released on Blu-Ray.    Finaly I just want to suggest, as of rule of thumb to ALL filmmakers who are seeing their films re-released in Blu-Ray, Do what you will to update your film, whether it be cropping, changing the aspect ratio, adding or deleting scenes, etc..., but alway's alway's ALWAY'S give us the original theatrical release as well. Yes it's that important, and I don't mind paying extra for a classic.   Thanks   COASO
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I'm seeing all these negative reviews, and I just had to put in my two cents.  Yeah, I would have liked for them to stay more true to the source material, but it was fun.  When you watch this movie, remember it is based on a comic book.  It is not Hamlet or Macbeth, but it's fun and very fast paced.  Megan Fox is totally hot, spending most of the movie running around in her underwear.  Josh Brolin did a good job playing Hex, which wasn't that different from his character in the 90's tv show \\"Young Riders.\\"  I thought the over-the-top weapons were great.  They reminded me of \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Army of Darkness.\\"  The movie was a little cheezy, but if you like action and westerns you'll like this movie.  If it hadn't been pushed as a serious movie, I believe it could have reached a B-movie cult status.
142313494X|5.0|Ask any knowledgeable person what the best way to kick off a series is, and I bet you they'd say \\"The Lightning Thief\\" by Rick Riordan, the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. The book gives a great amount of suspense, violence, friendship, action and adventure.  The half-blood (which means that one parent is a God and another is a mortal) goes on a quest with two newly acquired friends to either prevent or let World War Three happen. Percy is a child of Poseidon, a big three god which means he could possibly determine the fate of Olympus.    Percy's quest is to get Zeus's trident and bring it to Mount Olympus. If he fails then mankind will have to face the worst war they've ever seen. Along the way, Percy has to fight a bunch of monsters and take down the Ares, the war god. Percy is still also only 12 and is still learning how to use his powers.  Consequently he'll encounter trouble that he doesn't know how to deal with.    I mostly recommend this book to readers who enjoy fantasy, Greek mythology, and adventure. But don't read it close to bed time because it'll be a scary night for you!     an other review by, Alice Kreider    [[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]][[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]][[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]]New York time #1 best seller series  age:17  For me the lightening thief was interesting to read. The book \\"The Lightening Thief\\" is an  exciting  and fun book. And  it is great for mythology lovers. The lightening thief starts off  about a boy named Percy Jackson.A  troubled boy who always gets in trouble who has ADHD.  When he starts realizing that his teacher and best friend are protecting him from his pre algebra teacher who turns in to turns into a monster called a \\"fury\\"  and is trying to find out the right time to attack him, he must go on a wild chase to half blood camp  where a Minotaur attacks him killing his mother in action.  When he is safely held in camp half blood camp  he is told that his father is a god so he must stay there for safe keeping from monsters that will stop at nothing to kill him.  He easily makes friends and enemies while being closely watched  by elders to decide who his dad is. After realizing water heals him and he can control water  ,Poseidon claimed him as his son. Leaving him the son of one of the 3 big gods which is very rare and unlawful because they made a agreement to never have a kid with a mortals.    I really don't want to give the book away to you I guess you just have to read the book. ( you can find it in banes and nobles kids/teens section.)
B003VIW8DK|5.0|I have long been a fan of Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music. If you like his style you'll like this.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|The cd isn't just the bubblegum sweetness of it's killer singles (Electric Feel, Time To Pretend and Kids). This duo of new age Hippies bring the togetherness vibe of 60's music to their sound. Neil Young style solos, Traffic style ambience, Hendrix style soaring and yet their own touch making this a completely original album for anyone whos still beleives in Free Love.    I recomend this album for fans of Beck(An electro folk style music. He varies though from early 90's to his newest release in 2009) and THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE (a psycadelic blues band with Creedence style jams over MGMT beats and DOOM style organs. [...] )    Peace. Love. Music
B0041VV03A|1.0|Sick, they should just rename it \\"Sick\\". Utterly disgusting, exactly how low can Hollywood go? I can't help not thinking about the Nuremberg trials, when I wonder how these psyop perverts in Hollywood should be dealt with if they are ever brought to justice for their role in the utter destruction of every conceivable moral value in the minds of people.
0385732554|4.0|Do you like dystopias? Do you wonder how this world will turn out? Are you a pessimistic person? This book is one author's story about a world that prejudice against the different has taken over. The main character in this book is a boy named Jonah. He lives with his father and mother. Although these are not his birth parents they treat him as their own son. But one major part of a parent is their love. In this book feelings are mild. No pain no love and no hatred. The Community has no feelings and death is not painful. The old people in the community take a painless shot and then they are dead. Only one person in the community can feel sorrow, hurt, happiness and all the feelings we feel. Another thing that this Community has abolished is color. All people can see is a dull gray. Again the same person that has feelings can see colors.  Jonah is nearly 12 years old. This is when jobs are assigned. He hopes for a simple job that involves his interests. But nothing of the sort is given to him. The people at the community have been watching Jonah and he has been assigned the job as the Givers apprentice.   The Giver is a person in the community that carries all the memories of the world. All the rainbows, the pain and the world as we know it. The Giver is the only one who knows the memories. And now the giver is growing old and he must pass his knowledge to Jonah. It is a hard time for Jonah because all he ever knew is begin reversed as he sees the world that he lives in is cruel and harsh and all the people are naïve. Finally a plan is made as Jonah tries to save the world as he knows it from utter destruction.
0545123275|5.0|This book was amazing. I've read many varying from teen to adult. To biographies and poetry. I usually don't like books like this but this story was so compelling. The characters...wow. When I read the first page I was instantly hooked. I loved Sam. Even though we don't get to hear much from him in quite a while. As the story progresses you learn to love the characters. You instantly just fall in love with them. They're are the perfect couple brought to each other by destiny. The last pages had me crying like a baby. This book should definitely be read. It is uniquely one of a kind. I recommend it to all.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|An extraordinary performance, not to be missed.  All the leads, even Florez, transcend their stardom to get down to their characters and the performance is faithful to the score.  Wondrous is this.  And real.  And believable.<br /><br />The only more fascinating performance of Rigoletto I can think of, after 50 years of listening, is the Callas/Gobbi one (the studio one, NOT the live one when Mme C sang sharp as chalk against a blackboard).  But that performance is only on c/d's...and, let this be said out loud, not entirely faithful to the score (though even back then Mme C was leading the way by not concluding The Quartet with a high C).<br /><br />Do, please, if you love this opera, treat yourself to this dvd.  It will be a long time before you hear it better performed, I don't care what all star casts have already had their bash at it.  This is the Rigoletto dvd I'm going to go back to.<br /><br />Disclosures:  I have no financial interest in its sales, nor any acquaintance whatsoever with the performers or anyone else involved.  I'm just a plain old fashioned opry freak.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Although I'm a fan of Sound Garden and a HUGE Audioslave junkie, I'm not at all pleased with this style when it comes to Chris Cornell.<br />As others have said, I feel like the music, melodies, and voice are all disjointed, and nothing seems to flow well together.
1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians  Series by Rick Riordan  If you are a fan of Greek mythology, then this is the series for you! Anyone, any age will love this book. Greek gods, goddesses, demigods, monsters, titans and villains all await you in this series. Interested?    There are 5 books in this series. Let's start with a summary of the first. Zeus, the king of the Greek gods and goddesses, gets his master lightning bolt stolen. The bolt can destroy huge structures, like bridges and large buildings. He accuses 12 year old Percy Jackson of this crime. Poseidon, Percy's father and god of the seas, argues otherwise, and there will soon be a war. Now, Percy has until midnight on the summer solstice to return the bolt, or the world will become a battleground. However, Hades, god of the Underworld, captures Percy's mother, and Percy, his friend Grover the satyr, and Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom, embark on a mission to rescue Percy's mother from the Underworld and return the bolt to Zeus.     I think that the theme of this book was to persevere, because Percy didn't give up when his mother was taken, even when he fought Medusa, one of the deadliest monsters.    This was one of the best books that I ever read because I could literally see what was happening. I'd recommend this book to 8 to 15 year olds who love excellent adventure books, and I can almost guarantee that the Percy Jackson series will be some of the best books you'll read!
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I loved their 1st album so I bought this one even though I didn't really like the song that was out from it on the radio.  I'm a little disappointed.  It didn't seem to get me hooked like the first one.  But it is still a great CD, easy to listen too, good voices and great music.
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|Leif Ove Andsnes won a Gramophone award in 2005 for his recording of Rachmaninov's First and Second Piano Concertos, led by Antonio Pappano and accompanied by the Berlin Philharmonic [[ASIN:B000B63IEI Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2]].  For those wanting a 5.1 high resolution version of those performances, a DVD-Audio version is also still available - one of the few titles released by EMI called 'Extended Audio Discs' [[ASIN:B000CS4JAM Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2[Extended Audio Disc] [DVD Video]]].  In these concertos, Andsnes brought both grace and power together with brilliant technique. The advantage of the DVD-Audio disc is not only the higher resolution surround sound, but the addition of a tantalising glimpse of Andsnes rehearsing with the BPO and Pappano.  If only EMI had filmed the whole rehearsal or the whole live performance, such is the magnetism of Andsnes.    Now, five years later, Andsnes and Pappano have collaborated again to record the Third and Forth Concertos, this time with the LSO.  Andsnes says he loves working with Pappano as his extensive work in opera makes for a much more involving musical experience.  This is borne out admirably, again, in this exciting new recording.    Many people will ask why we need another recording of these much recorded works.  Andsnes himself previously recorded the Third Concerto fifteen years ago but felt that as he has grown emotionally, as well as artistically, he had something new to bring to these masterpieces.  Both are incredibly difficult to play but Andsnes' interpretation is both magesterial and brilliant, in equal measure.    Despite being a studio recording where you would expect ideal conditions, this disc has a less than perfect recording balance (the orchestra - the strings in particular - seem poorly placed and captured and there are other annoying extraneous noises in the Third Concerto - Mr Andsnes breathing heavily, I presume - they are, after all athletic works), which is very hard to understand.  What were the engineers doing ?  That being said, I feel this interpretation is so fine that it overshadows all other contenders.  It has already been given the Gramophone Magazine 'Editor's Choice' Award, for what it's worth, and I think that will be only one of many other awards to come.    Highly recommended.
0316098337|4.0|This book was chosen for my book club to read.  What little I knew ahead about the book made me nervous.  I don't like reading books about children in peril.  However, this book was a positive look at a mother's love for her child and her ability to help her child thrive despite a desperate situation.  I highly recommend this book.  It was a quick, easy read, but it gives plenty to discuss in a group setting.

At the hotel he was staying at for the night, he found himself in the dining hall face to face with a man he had worked with on one of his cases and they exchanged they're going a bouts and Poirot found out that Mr. Bouc was taking the Orient Express to get to his destination and decided he would travel with him to London even though they would get off at different stations.    When they arrived at the station, they found out that strangely the train was full, given that it was the off season and that if Poirot wanted to travel on that train he would have to share a room with one of the passengers. The trip began smoothly and he spent his time talking with his friend and observing the other passengers who were in the same car. Then one night the train gets stuck in a snow drift and after an array of strange moments during the night, in the morning it is discovered that the passenger in the next cabin was murdered!    Trapped on this train, it is up to Poirot and his friend to solve this even bigger mystery than the coming one in London.    This intricate, nose grabbing mystery by Agatha Cristie pulls you into the knowledge of planning, acting and puzzles as you try to solve the puzzling mystery...

0385732554|5.0|The John Newberry Award winning children's novel, The Giver, was such a pleasure to read. I remember reading it as a child and feeling consumed into another time and place, and being so interested by the characters I was reading of, and years later I felt the same way. A great book to \\"get lost in\\" as it really forces you to think about the world we live in.  The story follows a young boy who exists in a world of what they call, \\"sameness.\\" In this world everything is controlled leaving no chance of fear, anger, uncertainty, or any other unpleasant emotions. When Jonas, the young boy, turns 12, the path that is assigned to him will change his life forever, and this wonderful story takes you on the journey with him and his teacher (\\"the giver\\").  This is a story of hope, courage, human nature, love, passion, self-discovery, and so much more! A must read for all young adults and older!!
1441866868|2.0|I like the premise of the conflict between Calorie Companies and a country with uncontaminated seeds.  It's always nice to read about a future shift in power from \\"the usual suspects\\" so having a story set in Thailand was a strong element.<br /><br />But I have to compare this story to one that gave me a similar feel when I first started into it, Neil Stephenson's Anathem.  That story seemed to start as a small story about little details and grew into a huge, wonderful story.<br />The Wind-Up Girl gave me the opposite experience.  At the start I had the feel I was going to read this huge, epic, next-great story, and as it went along, it seemed to devolve into a very little story about very little details.<br /><br />I had a hard time staying interested.<br /><br />I did like the final resolution of the story, just felt like it took way too long to get there.
1400079144|2.0|Of course we've all read Brown's other two famous novels, and we either loved or hated them, but we respected what he did.  Looking towards The Lost Symbol I wasn't expecting another Angels & Demons, but I was certainly looking for another quality page turner.  It was a page turner, but the story certainly wasn't quality.    The story itself is very formulaic and predictable.  Brown purposefully went out of his way to make the most stereotypical evil bad guy, who just happens to always be one step ahead of everyone, even when that train of thought is no where near the logical conclusion on where such and such will lead Langdon next (sorry for being vague, but don't want to give any spoilers).  Add to that the typical pushy CIA director/Authority figure and the similarly brilliant and yet dumb geniuses all chasing down puzzle after puzzle piece, while the other is chasing him down, and you have a page turner that is not satisfying in the least.  And being a page turner can be good, a la Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code, but in this case there is absolutely no need to have every single three to five page chapter end in a cliff hanger with a don don don moment.    Eventually something came up that took me by surprise towards the end, something that was not as predictable as the rest of the book, and thus the 2 stars.  For that alone he redeemed himself a little and I truly was surprised.  But then the book ended so anticlimactically that you put it down feeling nothing except, perhaps, that you had wasted your time.  Please, Mr. Brown, end the Langdon series already.  The character and themes are played out and I would love to see you write about something else as equally interesting (hopefully without the oh so cinematic chapter endings that always have to be a cliff hanger).  Not a recommend.    2 stars.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|When I initally heard about this film, I was under the impression that it would have been another one of those dry starchy Sherlock Holmes films, so I decided to skip on it, that is of course until I got the real scoup on it. When I saw it I must admit, I was blown away. I had to watch the final fight scene on the bridge about 20 times. It is that intense, complex and tricked-out, you can't really absorb it in a single viewing.<br /><br />This movie breaks all the rules for the typical Sherlock Holmes film; Here he is presented not only with a sharp intellect for solving mysteries, but also with a deadly clinical accuracy when in all out fight. Not only is he able to predict his enemies attacks, but is able to counter effectively delvering the right measure of damage to keep is opponent off the scene for the time that he requires.<br /><br />The film takes you on a rollercoaster ride with the action. Slick sceenplay editing provides some misdirection and keeps you guessing and raises the level or intrigue.<br /><br />The 1890 London sets are surreal and the costumes are superb. No details seem to have been missed here. The music for this film, which is quite unsusal, also sets the mood marvellously well, I actually purchased this sound track.<br /><br />The bad guy, Lord Blackwood, is as slippery as a wet snake, and has his full bag of tricks and gives Holmes and Watson a very good run for their money.<br /><br />From start to the very end this movie will keep you gripped, both with the action and the storyline.

0060254920|5.0|Where the Wild Things Are is one of my favorite childhood books not to mention a Caldecott Medal winner. I can remember my first grade teacher reading this book to me and I like this book still to this day. Seeing the movie left me disappointed because I like the book much better. The story is about a boy named Max who has a wild imagination and one night he is sent to his room for being disruptive. In his room is where he imagines this place of wild things and he becomes ruler and king of the wild things. While in his imaginary places he gets a little homesick and returns home where his mother who loves him awaits him. All children have different ways of dealing with frustrations and I think this is a great book for kids to relate to. A child's way of thinking is different than an adults and I think this book can show children how to use their imagination and realize that we all have times when we are frustrated but we will always have those who care about us no matter how frustrated people can be at times. I love the moral of the story and the pictures are imaginative and creative and I think it is an overall great book and would read it to kids in the future.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|It's a show we'd never seen before. She's doing spectacular, as always, and the mood is as private as it's described in Amazon's review. Really worth buying if you want to have a Barbra Final Collection.<br /><br />The blu-ray edition specially transformed her voice in a somewhat magical experience.<br /><br />Recommended.
0345505387|2.0|I was really interested in hearing Outlander told through Jaime's point of view, but this was lacking. I fell in love with Outlander because of the story, and I missed it with this graphic novel.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This will be a brief review. The book is great for a writer and answers the question (at least for a lot of his books) where did he get the idea for this? I own it in both hardback and paperback, and wanted it for the Kindle but am just curious why the Kindle electronic version costs so much? If Amazon and the publishers would get the \\"long tail\\" concept through their head and lower the prices on the Kindle books it would increase the use greatly as well as increase profits as more readers switch to this medium.
0123694965|5.0|Well, it's difficult to add anything to the praise that this title has got already but let me say that only a foolish game designer, whether experienced or \\"wannabe\\", would skip over it and ignore its teachings and insights.  This book really changes our way of thinking and how to \\"see\\" through a game idea under the proper perspective to identify early any problem that may become apparent at a later stage of development and seriously hurt the whole game.  Get it and study it now!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|For anyone interested in knowing what caused the bottom to fall out of our financial sector and economy to the tune of trillions (shouldn't that be all of us?), Ferguson takes a complicated topic and spells it out in an intriguing, understandable and methodical way.  We knew things were awry; but this really blows the lid off the deal.  I don't think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind...a billion-dollar cabal with club members including the upper echelons of Wall St, Washington and academia.<br /><br />Nice blend of Matt Damon's narration and the interviews.  Definitely riveting...and troubling.  Even more distressing and disturbing for those who have suffered as a result of the financial collapse.  Unlike many documentaries that conclude with some specific 'calls for action', &#34;Inside Job&#34; leave viewers awestruck and without a laundry list of what to do or who to call.  In any case, very well done and highly recommended. Also, keep an eye on the large and impressive list of those who declined to be interviewed. Their silence was deafening.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I've always liked Alice in Chains, and more recently, I've really liked Jerry Cantrell's solo albums. This sounds like classic AIC, as far as tone, mood and surprisingly, vocals go, but the songwriting is very similar to Jerry's solo albums. Everyone is shocked by how similar William's vocals sound compared to Layne, but I think what people are missing, is how much Jerry's vocals (background and lead) contributed to the overall vocal sound of AIC. If he were not providing any vocals on this album, I think there would be a big difference compared to the old stuff. Luckily, he is, as he's a really good singer. This is a great album and there is no reason to rate each song - if you like AIC, buy it!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Just a note for previous review...... it's a pre order!!! Which means they will send it to you when the series is done!! Seriously!!!
B003L77TZI|1.0|Normally popular music is popular because it appeals to the lowest common denominator. This means it has mass appeal. However, Katy Perry has chosen to make music that falls well below the lowest common denominator. This record is no better than the last. The actual music is simplistic. The lyrics are trite, superficial and overtly sexual in places. The hooks do abound and there is a beat. I guess that is all most consumers care about these days because Teenage Dream really is nothing but a nightmare.
044654759X|5.0|This book is absolutely fabulous. A fast, great read! Fast because I couldn't put it down once I started it. A much better read than some of Sparks' other books. I was hooked from the very beginning instead of 5 or 6 chapters in to it. Throw in the seller's super fast shipping, and excellent description of just how \\"used\\" this book was - I got a fantastic deal!!
0525951652|4.0|\\"Fall of Giants\\" isn't an epic novel like \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" or \\"World Without End\\". It covers a relatively short time period (1911 - 1924) which allowed the author to go deeper with the characters of the novel. I enjoyed and recommend the book. Far above most books on Best Sellers lists.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is an infectious movie, and Jaden Smith is entirely convincing as the Kung Fu Kid.  And Jackie Chan has a great role as his teacher - he shrugs off his usual buffoon type role for the wise old hermit type.  My only regret is that Dre Parker neglected to leave his dear old mum (played by Taraji Henson) back home in Detroit - because every scene she appears in is truly cringeworthy. The movie is a great travelogue for China also, and the special features are good too.  Of course the movie is over long at 140 minutes, but who cares - the final tournament is great fun - for the viewers anyway. Thank goodness for the magic moxa!
B000EXZDOQ|5.0|It is quite entertaining to read the reviews of this album and the other Whitesnake albums.  The blues version of Whitesnake and the hairspray/flashy version of the band controversy is hilarious.  I am an old school blues rock fan so the blues version of the band appeals to me more.  Ready an' Willing was the first Whitesnake album I was turned on to while attending school in Evansville, Indiana where I frequently visited Roberts Stadium to see the blues rock bands of the day.  I always thought the connection with Deep Purple was cool and their sound has that connection especially with Ian Paice on drums and Jon Lord on keyboards.  One of the earlier reviews mentioned he thought the music had space with not much going on.  This is the problem I have with the later hairspray version is that after corporations took over music in the mid eighties, the bands started to loose the blues component of rock and roll which did have space.  Space is good!  Space is what lets the music breathe and give it some soul and groove.  Playing a lead guitar solo in every song as fast as humanly possible is boring to me because it has little soul in it.  The early version of Whitesnake was mostly based around rhythm guitar not bombastic lead guitar, saying look at me and how fast I can play.  Without the blues component to rock and roll what is it?  It leaves me cold without the blues.  The guys who started listening to Whitesnake in their hair metal mid 80s days, using the term metal loosely, reminds me of the old joke about the two bulls.  One bull was a young hyper bull talking to the old experienced bull.  The young bull was jumping up and down, restlessly, shouting as they looked down upon the group of cows in the valley and said \\"I'm gonna RUN down there and do one of those cows\\".  The old bull said \\"screw that, you're gonna stay here and I'm gonna WALK down there and do em all\\".  The old bulls know whats happening!   It's a shame that music has evolved into a corporate thing withno soul.  You young guys need to discover the roots of rock and roll.  Check out John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, the original Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green,  early J Geils Band before the freeze frame crap, 70s ZZ Top, 60s and 70s Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, Ten Years After, Robin Trower, Frank Marino, Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter and the bands who are carrying on the tradition, The Black Crowes, The Raconteurs, The Bottle Rockets, Gov't Mule, Drive By Truckers, etc.  They know about space!  Music with no space is like a when you take color wheel with all of the colors of the spectrum and put it on a drill and pull the trigger on the drill.  The color wheel goes real fast but turns white, no separate colors, just white.  No space , no color!
0765357151|4.0|My opinion of this book changed quite a bit while I read through it. Unlike what the title suggests, this isn't just the \\"I Am Legend\\" novella (which is 159 pages long), but rather it is a short story collection, containing 11 stories of various lengths. Some were very good, but some were not.<br /><br />The titular story was very good. We follow the main character, who believes he is the last human alive in a world populated by vampires. I was a little confused as to what the differences between the two \\"monster races\\" were (vampires and living creatures infected by the vampire virus, but not dead). It's a key plot point, but it was never clear in my head how each came about. The story also hits the science stuff pretty hard at some points, but overall it was a fascinating quick read.<br /><br />I liked the short story \\"Prey\\" quite a lot. Stephen King's quote from the back cover is \\"Books like I Am Legend were an inspiration to me.\\" That inspiration is very clear here, as this story feels like a precursor to King's short story Battleground (from the Night Shift collection). In King's story it is a collection of Army men that come alive, but for Matheson, it is a doll. In both, the human has to fight a deadly little creature that is trying to kill them. I loved it.<br /><br />\\"Mad House\\" is another story that I enjoyed quite a bit. To reference King again, I was reminded of the Shining a lot (in that book, the main character has plenty of rage issues to deal with).<br /><br />Some of the stories towards the end were good as well. I personally didn't care for the \\"Dance of the Dead,\\" \\"Witch War,\\" and \\"Dress of White Silk\\" stories, which unfortunately are lumped together in the middle of the book. My opinion of the book overall started to drop during that section, but picked up with the last 4 stories that finish up the book.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I purchased the duel Planet Earth/Life set off the shelf from [REDACTED].  The Planet Earth blu-ray was the Attenborough version.  The Life blu-ray was Oprah (I just threw up in my mouth a little).  I loved Planet Earth; I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of Life.  I literally had to turn it off because I was feeling suicidal.  Is this what British people think Americans want?  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered the Attenborough version of Life, which is well worth it.  I'm just pissed I overlooked the fine print saying which version of Life was in the set...    (An even bigger WTF would be why in the world a box set would come with both the best of the best and the worst of the worst?  Methinks there's a warehouse full of these somewhere and the only way to shell them out is to force them on [REDACTED] customers who buy the box set.)    I think I would actually pay money to never hear Oprah's voice again.  Hopefully Attenborough's Life will fit in the box set as a substitute, then I'll black out Oprah's name on the box and pretend this never happend.    Don't buy this, don't even think about it.
B003PIUC02|5.0|When I originally watched the pilot episode, I thought the show looked like it might be fun, but that it would probably be a gratuitously violent semi-parody of 300.  The violence was pretty stylized.  All the previews in the paper and on the web talked about how bloody it would be and how there would be lots of nudity.  So after that I waited several weeks before I saw the next episode, only half-interested.  Finally I saw the second episode, and it got more interesting, then the third, and let me tell you, they had me.  Two days later I had finished the entire season, looking bleary-eyed at work, but feeling very satisfied.  It is now one of my favorite shows on television.    It's true there is a lot of violence, and nudity (both male and female) is pretty common.  However, the story is very good, and the filming and style improves after the pilot.  There are several good plot twists through just this season.  You're never quite sure who the villain is, or if there even is one, until they're revealed.    The heroes are the strongest, not necessarily the saints.  The series is undeniably and unashamedly masculine, which is quite rare on television, and for me that was actually refreshing.  What morality they do portray is a masculine one, based on loyalty, strength, and honor.  However women certainly play a strong role in the story and they are as ambitious as dangerous as the men.    The dialog is unique, they went for a flowery style to give it an archaic feel.  It's not as good as Deadwood (in which the dialog was simply phenomenal), it does serve its purpose.  Aside from a couple of minor exceptions it doesn't devolve into exaggerated wordplay, and there are some great memorable lines.    CGI is used constantly to create a hyper real graphic novel-like visual.  Vibrant colors and dramatic backdrops flood the screen.  Unfortunately you can see through the CGI effects in some cases, they will use CGI to impale someone for instance, and they can't keep the swordmoving with the body.  I noticed that a few times, but they cut the scenes short so it wasn't distracting.  They did very well with the budget they had, considering, but you'll notice an occasional glitch.  Overall the effect is beautiful.    I was very surprised to enjoy it as much as I did.    Unfortunately, the future of the show is looking grim, since Andy Whitfield dropped out of the show to battle cancer.  They have a prequel half-season airing in 2011, but after that I don't know what will happen.  This first season was well worth the money to me, though.  Even if it doesn't continue, and even though I've seen it twice already, I know I'll be watching this again in the future.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and if my house was burning down the one I would save.
030758660X|3.0|I thought the layout of this book was very creative, but the patterns lack creativity.  These are very simple patterns that are not fitted or really shaped at all.  The patterns are mostly simple squares and triangles put together in tried and true ways that are pretty easy.  The layout of the book makes the patterns interesting, not the patterns themselves.  I do like the colorwork in the book though, lots of paw prints, and red yarn to simulate blood.    If you are looking for patterns to wear such as creative sweaters then you may want to look elsewhere, but if you like accessories then you may like what the author has to offer.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|This a rare Christmas CD. It's become part of so many people I know, their tradition at Christmas and during the Holiday season.  It's just not Christmas without this CD, especially All I Want For Christmas.  I never get sick of hearing it.  I would highly recommend this.  To have been made in the early 90's and still be THE Christmas music of the season, that is a huge WOW!  I thought it was just me but I can't count how many people I have found feel the same way.  Mariah created something so many artist try to for decades and fail to do.  ENJOY!!! for years to come
0439023513|4.0|While I loved the whole series, mainly for its unforgettable characters, it had to be hard to sustain such tension over 3 books, and nearly 1000 pages.  I think it might have been done better in 2 slightly longer books. I found the last book, Mockingjay, a little slow going.  I was tired of war, betrayal and the destruction of not only whole districts, but of the humanity of the characters.  Katniss' confusion throughout the last book, never let up.  She never quite got her act together so when she let loose her last arrow (I'm trying not to spoil the ending) I was surprised, not at what she did, but that there wasn't a little more forewarning.  Or maybe it just wasn't obvious enough for me.<br /><br />I might think that this series is a little too dark for its target age-group.  It rested too much on the material side for my tastes, and not enough on the spark of humanity that all but died in this series.  Even the ending doesn't feel like hope, but more like awakening from a nightmare only to have it continue when you go back to sleep.  Who would want to live in this world once the fighting was over?  And was anything really solved?  Did these people learn and evolve, enabling them to move away from the need to annihilate each other?<br /><br />It's no wonder that the author mentions 1984 as one of her favorite books.  The Hunger Games trilogy feels like it was played out with Orwell's novel as it's backdrop.  Dark, dark, dark.  Even the light at the end of the tunnel feels like it's a train coming to squash the victors with whatever it was that started this civilization down the road to total repression and the Hunger Games themselves.<br /><br />Still, an entertaining, and worthwhile read which I would recommend that kids and adults read just to experience how far power can take us down the road to ruin.
B004047XXO|4.0|We really liked the movie but wasn't impressed with the 3D feature. Maybe I was expecting too much after seeing a 3D movie in the theater. The effects were just not near as good.
B0042816YK|1.0|The only Julia Roberts movie I disliked.  And I hated it.  And god I thought it would never end.  I hear the book's better.  I wouldn't dream of reading it.  My sister (a Christian to the homophobic hilt) thought it was wonderful.  All the bad reviews of this flick I read are right on.  It is tedious, episodic, a travelogue with food and religion.  She rips herself away from her husband to go (on the advice of a fortune teller) on a search for herself.  Also she looks very old in this movie.  Which would be okay if she were playing a character her age.  I planned to buy this flick (I'm crazy about Julia Roberts), but changed my mind.
B004132I4S|1.0|I write few reviews. Each to their own, diversity and all that, yes?   But I just could not resist...      Wow....goes to show ya that theres something for everyone when it comes to music.   But as for me if I could give this guy a - rating I would.  People actually listen to this stuff? Amazing.    just my 2 cents.
B00006CXSS|5.0|bought as a gift for my mom. she loves it and got it earlier then expected and everything was as described.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|This is Sissor Sisters strongest work yet.  Every track is memorable.  Night Work starts off a bang and doesn't let up. (Minor quibble - Not a fan of the abrupt endings on a few of the songs.) Favorites are Whole New Way (cheeky), Any which Way (Is there a theme?), Harder You Get, Skin Tight, Sex and Violence, and the amazing Invisible Light. Ian McKellen. Are you kidding me? Genius. I can't stop listening to it. More please!
B003WTE886|3.0|i'm a huge taylor swift fan. while im older than she is her music brings me back to the days when i was learning what she is singing about. her lyrics definitely show a lot of maturity. for the people who say its about the same thing over and over please keep in mind she is like 20 years old. she is learning life. and yes she does sing about love a lot. i think a lot of people talk about love or the opposite sex in daily conversation. and in life all of us have been known to  make the same mistakes over and over again (maybe with different consequences), so please stop complaining about how she always sing about the same thing.  the reason i took two stars off, is because in my opinion i wasnt too impressed with the music itself. its hard to explain, but the music fit the lyrics perfectly on fearless. here, its kinda awkward. and in some songs, while i love the lyrics the music itself got a little boring. some are actually forgettable.  here is a rundown of the songs:    *1. Mine: great song. very catchy. defiantly download.    *2. Sparks Fly: another great song. this song has the \\"matching song and lyrics\\" that i loved from fearless.    *3. Back to December: very beautiful ballad. the lyrics are amazing and the music is so beautiful with the orchestra.    *4. Speak Now: this song has the usual taylor charm. love it.     *5. Dear John: this song has very beautiful lyrics but the music can get a little boring. esp. at almost 7 minutes. download for the lyrics.    *6. Mean: i love how country this song is. and the lyrics are perfect for an anti bullying campaign, esp with all the recent bullying suicides.    7. The Story of Us: not worth downloading. this has the awkwardness i was talking about earlier. boring song.    *8. Never Grow Up: in my opinion the strongest song on the cd. the music is very simple and while her voice is not the strongest on this song, the rawness of the song makes this the strongest one of the whole cd.    *9. Enchanted: the lyrics are amazingbut its very boring. as a poem this is amazing to read. download for lyrics.    10. Better Than Revenge: this doesnt sound like taylor. more like kelly clarkson.    11. Innocent: it's an ok song. not my personal favorite.    12. Haunted: boring. very awkward.    13. Last Kiss: again not another favorite.     *14. Long Live: this song kinda reminds me of Change, but not as great as Change. I lovew the lyrics though.    *if you just want to download a few songs cause your not a huge taylor fan, i recommend these.
0763619612|5.0|I teach middle school art and I read this to my students at the start of each quarter. Love it! And they love it too (even the 8th graders).
B003PIUC02|4.0|I enjoy watching the first season of this show. Some months ago I watched Rome and liked it too. I would say they are about the same. I liked Rome a little bit better, I think. But Spartacus is still highly recommended.
B002UD56I6|5.0|What ever you thought of Michael Jackson, he is the greatest entertainer of all time - that is a fact!!!...this film is marvelous..I only wish that more of that 120 hours of footage could be released...Michael Jackson was the Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire/Gene Kelly of this generation...His choreography places him in the league class as Astaire and Kelly...entertainmentwise, he will be sorely missed
B003J27WFW|5.0|I've loved Rush since the 70's.  This DVD confirmed all my feelings about the band  and made me an even stronger fan.     Lifeson, Lee and Peart can't be replaced in Rush.  This is a unit. They are like brothers...what a cool band.    I've watched this DVD over and over since I bought it.... very entertaining and interesting documentary.    BUY IT.
B003W5C0VM|2.0|After obtaining \\"Live at the Max\\" recently, I was really looking forward to this Blu-ray, however I'm disappointed.   This is one product that remastering does absolutely nothing for. The sound, as reported in prior reviews is flat with no dynamics and modern day Dolby or DTS has failed to do anything in the way of improving this.   The video also, originally shot on 16mm film, is typical of the low resolution available and again remastering has not improved it to any extent.   The lighting is boring and throughout is a dull red look, with no feel for the sparkle of a live concert.   Dedicated fans may look past these criticisms to the performance. This is true and valid, but if you are wanting some reasonable quality to enhance this, forget it!   I haven't seen the DVD version, but I would imagine it is exactly the same as Blu-ray cannot achieve the impossible and enhance the original anymore than standard DVD in this case.   If fans have not seen and can obtain a copy of the \\"Deep Down Under\\" concert, shot in Australia in 1988, this gig in my opinion leaves \\"Ladies & Gentlemen\\" for dead. Even though made for television and only in 4:3 aspect ratio, the video and stereo audio is great, as is the concert. I don't think this one is officialy available, but exists around the traps. The rehearsal footage, shot the evening prior to the main TV shoot is also fantastic and is as good as the show itself. I know, I have it!
0451191153|5.0|Rand is an amazing writer.  This book is such a breath of fresh air.  You don't see any story lines like this anymore.  The people who do not like her seem to have more of a problem with her philosophy versus her story and writing.  If you yell a lot about the rich getting richer then you're probably predisposed to dislike this book but I still highly recommend you open your mind and give it a shot.  If nothing else maybe you'll understand your enemy's frustration.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|Okay, it's not as good as the original show and first movie. However, I thought it was lavish, unrealistic, silly fun and let's face it, isn't that what Sex And The City is all about?
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Movie was well done.  It compares to the book quite well.  A must see for anyone who has read the book.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Jason wakes up sitting in the back of a bus, holding a girls hand. He has no clue how he got there or anything about himself. At first his two best friends, Piper and Leo think he is joking. Until the Venti come and try to toss them off the side of the Grand Canyon and their coach turns out to be a goat. Then, they don't know what to believe.<br /><br />The book as a lot of great references to Greek and Roman mythology. I love learning about the mythology but also reading an adventure book. The Persy Jackson series focused just on Greek, but this one starts to veer towards Roman and you begin to realize maybe there are more demigods out there...but Roman ones.<br /><br />The three Demigods that go on the adventures seem a bit reminiscent of the Persy Jackson trio. Two boys and one girl. One of the boys and the girl in a relationship. It would have been nice if he switched it up a bit with maybe two girls and a guy or four demigods. These three seem to be much more powerful than Persy and his friends were.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars is, it would lose my attention a lot. There was a lot of action and adventure but it didn't seem to peak my interest. I always knew it was coming it just seemed like the same old same old. But, I enjoyed the new characters and the new Roman mythology along with the Greek.
0060899220|5.0|Reads just like his television series.  You can actually see him speaking.  My wife and I both enjoyed the book.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Although it is in fact the doctors screwdriver, its missing the wallet.    \\"Includes wallet with \\"Wipe-Clean\\" paper. UV ink nib and black ink nib\\"     not included at all.     Also, my \\"invisible\\" ink was dry upon arrival.    Otherwise, it does have the look and feel of the 10th doctors sonic screwdriver.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|I play competitively for  super smash bros. melee still, so I needed a controller that had quality. I had bought a controller from gamestop and the Y button wouldn't work. When i got my new white controller it was perfect for competitive use, and it will also work for casual gamers as well. It is the best controller that I have had so far.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Fizzy, frothy, bouncy, bubbly, delightful, delicious, insatiable, infectious POP!  Unabashed toe-tapping, bum-bumping, disco-dancing music.    A feel-good album. Sometimes that's what you need. Love it.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|As with most ancient, well known females the information that survived on Hypatia is only partial. We know she was a teacher, mathematician, philosopher... With so few facts to work with this movie did an amazing job of giving her life.<br /><br />Hypatia living in the middle of yet another of the infinite religious, political struggles of this world. She is only interested in knowledge, science and astronomy and is murdered for politics, religion and her gender.<br /><br />This movie is a success in that it brought Hypatia and the world she lived in to life in a way that had not been done before. It may not be what exactly happened, but it held enough truth to keep me interested and emotionally move me.<br /><br />Also, it caused me question how anyone can be a devout follower of any religious dogma as each and every one of them was born from blood of innocents.
B000UYX4OK|5.0|This is one hell of an epic movie. Not as \\"epic\\" as Troy but epic none-the-less. The bluray picture quality is great. The scenery is awesome (more awesome than braveheart). You must buy this. It turns out that Hollywood is not the best movie place. Canada does it better.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I like all of the soundtracks for Star Wars, but this one to me is the strongest. Episode 3 Battle of the Heroes is my favorite overall track for the prequels, but episode 1 is the strongest soundtrack overall. I love the power of the percussion and the dreamy choirs. I think that the soundtrack surpasses the movie, sorry George.
030745455X|5.0|this is an excellent book, I mean excellent ! The entire series ( three ) is a great read, very interesting and intriguing story line and paced like the beat of a drum.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|I think this is probably my favorite DT album.  I also have high end gear for playback and all of DT recordings are quite good, but this one in particular is their best.  I listen to it a lot and find it actually be therapeutic.    On this album everybody manages to do something differently musically but you can still identify who they are, they all have a \\"signature\\" or \\"footprint\\" for their sound like in real life is never put down the same twice!  I like how they never sound the same, the music is \\"real\\" music with tone, emotion, and words you can put a picture to...perfectly matching their band name!      I've always had admiration for James LaBries' talent too...he can turn ANY lyrics into a singable tune.  It's like he could pull a paragraph out of encyclopedia and make it sound great.
1932100660|5.0|I had this book recommended to me by two friends, one of whom is a nutritionist, the other one saw their cholesterol levels drop 60 points after following Dr. C's recommendations for a short period of time.     I found it hard to believe at first, after all I have read every diet book out there, including Atkins, Zone and South Beach. Could my tuna sandwiches, cheese, cobb salads, chicken, and omelets with bacon really be causing me so much trouble? I decided to find out. I did not have a lot of weight to lose (but lost 7 pounds), more importantly  I was struggling with some health problems of my own. After following the recommendations of the book for a couple of months I can honestly say:    -Blood pressure: was getting high and is now normal  -Allergies (hayfever/asthma) much improved and are now practically gone  -Indigestion/heartburn: much improved  -Tiredness/fatigue: pretty much gone, I feel very energetic.    Now I realize this is purely anecdotal evidence so I will go on with my review of the rest of the book. It is part autobiography, part scientific treatise, part nutrition manual and part opinion piece, backed up by some very compelling research. A small part of it is his own but most of the 35+ pages of references cited in the book are actually from others.     Dr. Campbell draws upon his long career as a scientist, researcher and teacher. He has sat on several government panels and he began his career convinced that animal foods were good for you and was raised on a dairy farm. Over time, through his own observations and the research of others, he began to grow suspicious that meat and dairy were not health promoting foods. He began to suspect that a diet made of whole, natural plant foods was actually the more health promoting diet that would prevent many diseases and support health across the board. His hypothesis draws in several noted doctors who are able to help their patients using a plant based diet, including Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, and Dr. John McDougall. These are men whose patients have been very much improved but the mainstream fails to accept the fact that a plant based diet could be beneficial. Why? I would like to know why myself!    Dr. Campbell comes down fairly hard on high protein meat diet pushers, vitamin peddlers, doctors who know nothing about nutrition and are in bed with the drug companies, as well as government institutions who are unwilling and unable to accept that such a simple solution like this might exist in the world!    As for recommendations on what to eat, it is mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Do not think you can become a vegetarian and eat a lot of white bread, white pasta, candy, cookies and cake, he specifically notes that eating this way is a bad idea. Vegetable oils and fish show up on the minimize list. I have eaten a tiny bit of fish since starting my experiment. He says try his plan for a month and see how you feel! What have you got to lose? Indeed nothing. After getting a few cookbooks I have come to love and embrace this lifestyle. I don't know if I will ever be a 100% vegan, over the last few months I have rarely eaten a piece of fish or some cheese but overall I think Dr. Campbell is really onto something.    A lot of his critics seem to think the book is just about becoming a vegan, I think the critics have not really read the book very carefully! There is a wealth of wisdom and information here which everyone should consider. Even if you don't want to cut meat out of your diet forever, you would do well to consider Dr. Campbell's recommendations of getting the majority of your nutrition through natural, whole plant foods. You really don't need prescription drugs or expensive supplements if you are eating a healthy diet and exercising. I am doing it and I think it's great! I hope for better things to come in my future.     I would really recommend you try his approach before going on statins, blood pressure medication or diabetes medication. It just may work for you instead of drugs and surgery, and who wouldn't want to try that first before going on prescription drugs?    My only criticism would be the title of the book, which has lead some people to believe this is only a book about the China Study. I have read some statements of Dr. Campbell admitting this may have been a mistake and his publisher wanted to call the book by this name. He wanted to find a suitable publisher and the other publishers wanted to edit the book and include a lot of recipes.     A good companion book is \\"Eat to Live\\" by Dr. Joel Fuhrman, or anything written by Dr. Fuhrman, they are both very inspiring.

0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett does it again with another historical masterpiece.  This novel is nearly 1,000 pages long, and it brings the reader hours of entertainment.  I find it sad and irresponsible that readers are giving this book negative reviews because of the Kindle cost.  I have a Kindle too, and I don't like paying 20 dollars for the book.  However,  I would pay twenty dollars for two tickets to watch a 90 minute movie, and with this book I had days worth of entertainment.  Yes, I think the publishers are getting greedy, and I wish the publisher would change the pricing.  But, this is a forum to rate the book.  Let's take our pricing concerns to Amazon. Ken Follett is an amazing author who deserves to hear our praise for this wonderfully researched enthralling novel.

159448385X|5.0|This is the first book that I had read by Khaled Hosseini. I was introduced to this book in a book club. I found this fictional book very interesting about the past and present life in Afghanistan. Even though the book was fictional, it captured the real life experiences that some Afghanistan women experience. This book focuses on the life of two young girls growing up with the struggles of life through adulthood. The book continued to surprise me with every turn of the page. It was very detailed in developing the emotions and characteristics of the characters within the story. This book can increase your interest and thoughts about the Middle-Eastern culture. A thousand Splendid Suns is definitely a MUST READ!
1401227821|5.0|A must buy for anyone remotely interested in Adam Hughes' works as well as comic book artists in general. The quality and notes left is something you should never pass up on seeing as well as reading. A MUST BUY if you don't already own the absurd amount of ridiculously amazing covers from various comic book series Adam Hughes has been involved with.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|The best mini-series ever.  For the mature audience and non prudes (my wife wouldn't watch it); but it portrays life as it most likely was in that time.  I liked the unusual use of the English language to emulate Roman protocol in everyday conversation.  It piqued my interest in Roman history to where I purchased a couple of history books dealing with that time period.  Excellent acting; intriguing plot.  Perhaps a bit too much blood which at times looked artificial.  I felt a sense of loss when it was over.
1595825045|5.0|If you're a fan of the series, you absolutely have to get this book. There's many unanswered question as well as interesting facts that you wouldn't know without having read this amazing book. The artwork itself is enough to warrant a purchase. Buy it. It's well worth the money.

0767827791|5.0|Just saw this film again on TCM (where else?), and couldn't help but to check it out on Amazon. This is another of those great Broadway stage hits of the early 50s(Holden's part was originally played by Ralph Meeker) that more than held its own as a movie--aided by all the great talent that was Hollywood in those days.     First of all, you have one of the great romantic film scores: the Moonglow/Picnic theme was a major singles hit at the time, and remains one of my favorite film musical themes. The piano, by the way, was played by Steve Allen, who also wrote the lyrics to the Picnic melody, used so beautifully in counterpoint to the familiar Moonglow jazz song.    Then you have the famous Holden/Novak dance to the Moonglow/Picnic theme, which is probably the sexiest dance scene ever done on film. The chemistry between the two is hot hot hot. When the beautiful,innocent Novak walks down those steps slapping her hands and swinging her hips to that jazzy beat at the virile Holden, you know you're watching film history.Her sexual coming out,if you will. It really is a question of who is seducing who? The direction of this scene by Joshua Logan is superb.     And yes, the supporting cast of pros are also wonderful. When Roz Russell gets on her knees and says \\"please\\" [marry me] to a hesitant Arthur O'Connell, I was moved to tears. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film.    They don't make movies like this any more. Why? Because the screenplays aren't there and neither are the stars.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I love all his novels.. and am sure this would be a good one. However, I am a Kindle owner in Canada, and found to my annoyance that Michael Connelly novels are not available to me. At only a few dollars less than regular book price, I would easily have bought this one so I could take it with me on my trip. I cannot figure out any reason for his books not being available to me, except perhaps some fight among publishers etc.. How disappointing!!!!!!!
0440243688|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books except 16 Hours.Gone Tomorrow was one of his best.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|This is better than The Dark Knight...by a longshot! The Joker in this movie was more evil, funny, and just plain interesting than any other Joker I've seen. The scene where he eats potato chips before \\"proving his worth\\" was awesome!!! Plus, Barnie Stinson as Nightwing! Best animated action movie ever! But remember, this is definitely NOT for children.
B002K4MAA2|4.0|I bought this U.K. Pal DVD for a Region-Free DVD-Player I bought specifically to play all the great European (but mostly British) releases that aren't yet available in the U.S.<br />However, guess what - this actually plays in my regular DVD Region 1 player also.  Not that I would have known if I hadn't tried it out of curiosity.  The show is great right up until the poorly written last 10 minutes or so where people do ridiculous things for no good reason.  But, the ending aside the chase scenes and tension-building are very good, much like '28 Days Later' as are the Zombies, who are all fitter in death than they are in life.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|We love this show!!  It is hilarious!!  It's a real funny comedy.  I didn't like Ed O'Neil's character on Married with Children, but I love his character on Modern Family, so this must make him a fantastic actor!!  Sofia Vargara who play's Ed's younger wife on the show is really funny, too.  For instance, this last week, she wanted to surprise Jay by ordering him a box of baby cheeses, but because of her accent, he ended up with a box of baby Jesus's.  It was hilarious!!  Love Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell as the parents of three kids.  Fantastic show!!  Love all the characters!!!!
B000000ITC|5.0|Thank goodness. When Alan Parsons authorized the release of this excellent progressive rock album in the new CD format in the early '80s, he felt fit to \\"update\\" the tracks with additional synthesizers and a narration track by Orson Welles. To this listener, it was the equivalent of updating the original Star Wars movies with new CGI effects in the 1990s by George Lucas. Sure, you understand the desire to take a new view of the original material, but is it an improvement?<br /><br />In this case, NO! I enjoyed the instrumental tracks (sans voiceover) on my LP copies enough to replace the records several times when they got the inevitable scratches over time. And I always felt that the orchestral scores were quite sufficient to stand alone without additional studio production to grab some of the synth-heavy '80s mindset.<br /><br />So I'm happy to report that this Original Master Recording Gold special edition (out-of-print, unfortunately) may be the last, best look at the original masterpiece, remastered properly for compact disk. For listeners who haven't formed strong opinions about the material, buyers get the bonus of the remixed tracks so they can make up their own mind whether Parsons was right or not to add to the original work.<br /><br />I recommend this CD as a great (and successful) experiment in merging classical and progressive rock sensibilities by an acknowledged studio master at the height of his powers.<br /><br />Note: this review only applies to the Original Master Recording Gold 2-CD edition; the standard and MP3 editions do not contain the instrumental versions described above!
B0042KZJR8|5.0|I just love Michael Buble.  Seen him twice in concert and he was fantastic!  My favorite songs on this cd is Cry Me A River, and Hold On.  Saw him sing Cry Me A River Live in person, and he was amazing.  Hope he puts his Crazy Love concert on DVD.
0596009208|3.0|I bought \\"Head First Java, 2nd edition\\" based on several good reviews here and on other sites, expecting a useful beginner book and a gentle introduction to the Java language.  For a non-programmer.  And to begin with things were moving along quite well.  The authors want you to not use an IDE, rather type everything in notepad and then run it from the command line.  This inevitably leads to some typos and subsequent compiler errors.  The authors want you to see this and learn from it.  Let me tell you this gets tedious after a short while.  I want to learn Java, and spending excessive amounts of time hunting down typing/syntax errors doesn't help in that regard.  In particular syntax errors, since they are never obvious and finding them means comparing the text in the book with what you see on your screen character by character.    But you move along, at a brisk pace, with introduction of new material every few pages.  And then comes the Battleship game.  Around page 135 or so.  And you have to type the code, save the file, type more code, save more files, and then you realize there's an error.  By design.  Correct the error by re-typing one huge file.  Except the error didn't go away.  Start looking for errors.  Can't find any.  Look some more.  Still no luck.  Download the files from the books web site.  Well, there's only two, and the second isn't being used yet.  But the game will not function without some files from the previous chapter.  And they don't work right anymore because you have changed things.  As the book told you to do.  And back and forth you go.  And then you realize: you're not learning Java, you're spinning your wheels trying to sort out what the authors should have fixed in the first place.    After about four hours of this I closed the book, put it up on the bookshelf, headed out for the local bookstore and picked up \\"Sam's Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours, 5th edition\\".  I'm about half way through it now, and it has been a much nicer experience.    So while \\"Head First Java, 2nd edition\\" may be a fine and useful book for others, it has been a waste of time and money for me.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Yes this movie is slow, and I was surprised by the subtitles in the beginning.  However, I liked that it wasn't obvious how the subplots would reconcile themselves (like in most movies today), and the acting is very good, the story is interesting, and the movie is ultimately moving and rewarding.    I also enjoyed being introduced to actor Cecile De France.  Although she was new to me,she has starred in numerous films in Europe, and I have already started reserving some at my local library.
B0002DXEPI|1.0|I had to return for an exchange.  The DVD didn't work.  We'll see how the new one is when I get it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Shelter\\" countless times on the web before I decided to buy the DVD.  I think this is a very tender yet realistic and mature portrayal of a love story between two men.  It is unfortunate that there are so few gay love stories of this caliber.  The characters are well-developed and the acting is superbe (especially Trevor Wright!).  I trust that I will have the great pleasure of seeing more projects from the Writer/Director Jonah Markowitz. Amazing work - keep it up!! :)
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Having just seen this film I wanted to see what others had to say.  The intutive,and insightfullness of Muzzlehatch,well he was right on.......I will not  be lenghthy in my comment.  Regardless of your upbinging, and I am referring to any religous teaching or thoughts, this film is about life.....what we know, have been told by those who have experienced the \\"near death\\" and have lived and how each of us choose to use this knowledge in our own lives.  The slowness of the film is not a deterrant, it is refreshing, gives you time to appreciate the completeness of the emotions and reactions.  In praise of Clint Eastwood, would anyone expect anything but the very best from this man of character?  A film that will be in my mind forever.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|but it is a Lifetime movie waiting to happen. As usual, Sparks knits a well told tale and you get very caught up in what you know will happen next. For me, it was a quick read but a total Stephen King ending. Honestly, I expected more. So, when's the movie coming on?
B003PIUBZS|4.0|WIth complex storylines, vivid characters and lusty performances, Spartacus is enjoyable adult entertainment. It feels to me like an NC-7 rated version of Ridley Scott's Gladiator.<br /><br />Andy Whitfield is striking as the stoic and sexy lead character. The recent news that he has had to drop out of future production due to poor health is sad on many levels. Please keep him in your thought and prayers for a speedy recovery.<br /><br />It's great fun to see Lacy Lawless back on the small screen. She was an exciting campy wonder as Xena, but here she shows her real acting chops, and she's terrific. The whole cast is a revelation - how they find so many talented actors, who play so well together, is beyond me.<br /><br />The production values are insanely impressive for a TV show. While some of the green screen work is a little obvious, the vast majority is compelling and believable enough that it creates an immersive world.  Meanwhile, other set pieces like costumes and props are more subtle but equally impressive. I hope the production crew gets the recognition they deserve for their painstakingly detailed work.<br /><br />The two things that I'd like to see less of on the series are the gratuitous nudity and cartoonishly excessively amounts of blood. Not that I'm a prude by any means, but both tend to take me out of the story. At times, these elements feel tacked on, as if there's a quota for how much flesh and plasma each episode must display. The nudity bothers me less than the gore - the show takes place in a lusty world where the human body is both celebrated and exploited. But I don't understand the artistic decision to so excessively animate fountains of blood and severed limbs.  When scenes of battle and torture are depicted as slo-mo abstractions of wildly exaggerated red blooms, beautifully grotesque, I'm not sure what the producers are saying about the violence, or what it's supposed to make us feel. For me, the self-concious special effects just call attention to themselves while distracting from the narrative.<br /><br />Other than those two quibbles, this is a wonderfully acted, impressively produced show that is most moving in its quietest moments. It's a wonder to me that entertainment of this caliber is produced for TV.stracting from the narrative.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This blu ray package, Alien Anthology is phenomonal. Its the best restoration job to hi def ive ever seen of any movie on blu ray especially from a movie from the 70's which sets the bar very high for other companies, even considering the second two movies which were really great restorations just not as well as the first two. Which is really strange considering they were made in more recent times. The only one that has noticable differences that may irrate a little is the last movie resurrection. There are scenes where it like switches how it was restored the color may change and it may look a little less sharp and clear than other scenes, and some scenes there is too much noise but some scenes are really clear on clarity and it was a great job on those scenes. Overall it shows how blu ray should be for older movies the first alien and the second alien. Theres no excuse for doing a lesser job on older movies. This is a perfect example of what i mean. I could see every detail. All of the pours on everyones faces, all the lines on there chapped lips, the persperation looked so clear and real, everything is just beautiful. I could seriously see every detail in every scene. Things i wouldnt see in the dvd version. I actually did compare the dvd version of the film Alien to the blu ray version and there is an incredible difference. It looks completely new. Not to mention the sound is phenomonal. Its so realistic. It feels like your right there. The quality of the movie sound and picture is like it was made today recently thats how beautiful it is at least for the first two films overall the second two films there are scenes like that where its like it was made recently but its not constant. At least thats what i noticed but its still very well done. Not to mention the endless extra features. Which captures every aspect of the movie. Interviews with the original crew, behind the scenes, commentaries so much more which is 65 hours worth. Its not incredibly expensive considering what your getting which is two versions of all four movies beautifully remastered in hi def with lots of commentaries, endless extra features the making of each movie plus loads more. Its definitely well worth it, its a must have and in my opinion is not that expensive. For those who complain about the price and that you already have these movies on there releases in VHS and dvd so why get the blu ray, the truth is these movies are beautifully restored and remastered for hi def making it 100 percent better than the dvd version not to mention the fact you get every special feature from all previous releases these movies are the best they have ever looked making it a must have and well worth the price. So if you have an HDTV and a blu ray player of course this is a must have. As for the actual movies in my opinion the first three movies are the absolute best, a must have. They have the best stories, and the way the first three movies were put the together make them the best. The graphics are the best on the first two and not far behind that on the third however some scenes are obviously fake like when the alien runs but that has nothing to do with restoration. The fourth movie, resurrection, is also really good its a really good story line except there are some parts which i found stupid maybe even kinda corny as far as dialogue goes but its a really great story that continues the collection but it doesnt compare to the first three. It isnt horrible or even just okay though also. Its a really good movie in my opinion just not as good as the first three which in my opinion were the best by far.dering what your getting which is two versions of all four movies beautifully remastered in hi def with lots of commentaries, endless extra features the making of each movie plus loads more.

0061673730|5.0|This book changed my life.  It was my first encounter with philosophy.  i read in 8th grade.  My way of thinking about everything changed when i read this work, noticing myself analyze and ask why in regard to everything.  This stayed with me through undergraduate physics and mathematics and, now, I find myself transitioning from a master degree in theoretical physics to a dual Phd in physics and the philosophy of physics.  I can't help but to credit this book with altering the way I think.  I am forever grateful.<br /><br />This book is one of the most accesible philosophy books ever written.  I always recommend to friends and family books on philosophy that I think satisfy everything you will ever need to know about philosophy if you only wnat the bare minimum: 1) Ishmael by Quinn 2) True Believer by Hoffer 3) Atlas Shrugged by Rand 4) The Fountainhead by Rand 5) Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence
0061997811|5.0|I love this book from cover to cover. it is like a huge Harry Potter film scrapbook. it was interesting reading about how the films, props, and costumes were made as well as all of the quotes from the actors themselves.

This a must have for all Harry Potter fanatics.
1932100660|4.0|If you have heart disease, you can thank your lucky stars that Dr. Campbell wrote The China Study. However, China's stroke rate is higher than our heart disease rate. At the time of the China Study the average total cholesterol in rural China was 127. This is good for heart disease but these levels are associated with a high risk of stroke. The book does not warn us about this. There are ways to reduce the risk: Don't get less than the RDA of protein, treat hypertension if you have it, don't smoke, don't drink alcohol or caffeine, keep sodium consumption low, potassium consumption high, walk a lot and when lifting weights don't get too close to your one rep max.<br /><br />According to World Health Organization stats<br />China - Heart disease 69/100,000, Stroke 159/100,000<br />US - Heart disease 106/100,000, Stroke 32/100,000<br /><br />The book claims that all animal foods cause disease. But the vegetarian Adventists who live ten years longer (88 years) than the average American (78 years) eat eggs and dairy products. No culture has ever totally avoided animal foods.<br /><br />VITAMINS AND MINERALS - Unless they supplement, vegans tend be deficient in vitamin B12. This can cause permanent spinal cord degeneration if it goes on for too long. It's also easy to be deficient in protein, calcium and fat soluble nutrients like vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. This can lead to accelerated tooth decay. It's easy to solve these problems with supplements but the book does a poor job of warning us.<br /><br />PROTEIN - In rats, protein restriction during pregnancy resulted in shorter life for the offspring. (The average life expectancy in all of China is only 73.8 years. Their number one cause of death is COPD, which is mostly caused by breathing coal smoke and a high rate of cigarette smoking. Their second leading cause of death is stroke, which could be partly explained by their very high salt consumption plus their high rate of smoking.  Their health care system isn'tas good as the US, so that's also part of the problem. If they didn't breath a lot of coal smoke, have a high rate of cigarette smoking and eat too much salt they might actually live longer than Americans.) In children, not enough protein can stunt their growth. In the elderly, not enough protein can increase the risk of congestive heart failure, loss of muscle mass and bone density. The World Health Organization recommends .83 g/kg of protein that has been adjusted for protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). At the time of the China Study the average protein consumption was less than the this amount.<br /><br /> For a 150 pound person the recommendation for protein is 56.6 grams. If you were to eat 2000 calories from rice alone you would get 41.5 grams of protein. The PDCAAS for rice is .55, so after adjustment you would have 22.8 grams of usable protein. You would have to eat almost 5000 calories from rice to meet the recommendation. Protein requirements are greater for:<br />1) pregnant women<br />2) children<br />3) the elderly<br />4) people recovering from an infection or an injury<br />It's easy to solve this problem by eating more beans or a small amount of fish or skim milk but the book doesn't warn us. Based on Dr. Campbell's own experiments with rats, 5% of calories from milk protein or other animal protein should be harmless.<br /><br />LONGEVITY - Since protein restriction (without calorie restriction) extends the life of animals in the lab, vegans might live a very long time if they avoid deficiencies, take steps to lower their stroke risk and get regular checkups. Donald Watson (September 2, 1910 - November 16, 2005) was founder of the Vegan Society and inventor of the word vegan. His parents were not vegans and he didn't become one until age 14. He lived to be 95 years old. But I don't know if he ate an extremely low fat diet, many vegans do not.<br /><br />WATCH OUT FOR CONFIRMATION BIAS<br /><br />Confirmation bias is somethingwe all have and refers to a type of selective thinking whereby one tends to notice and to look for what confirms one's beliefs, and to ignore, not look for, or undervalue the relevance of what contradicts one's beliefs. Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Hence they can lead to disastrous decisions, especially in political, social and nutritional contexts. The antidote is to beware of overconfidence and actively look for evidence that our beliefs might be at least partly wrong.<br /><br />SEVERAL WAYS TO BE HEALTHY<br /><br />1. A vegan who supplements with vitamin B12, 2000 IU vitamin D, calcium, gets omega-3 from walnuts or flaxseed, doesn't eat less than the RDA of protein and keeps their cholesterol above 150. Or a vegan with heart disease who keeps their cholesterol below 150.<br /><br />2. Vegetarian Adventist men and women live an average of 87 and 89 years, respectively, they abstain from alcohol and tobacco, exercise regularly, eat nuts, eggs and dairy products. See [[ASIN:1426207557 The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest]].<br /><br />3. In the 1960s Crete had close to the best longevity in the world.

B000063V8S|2.0|I like this season, and I have no issues with the stories or the acting - but I have a big problem with the transfer onto DVD.  I should note that I am watching this on a 46\\" Sony Bravia with a Panasonic Blu-ray player.  In general, the picture quality is on par with those episodes I see on those bad local stations no one has ever heard of.  The issue is not my TV - lots of other DVDs look perfect.  'North By Northwest' is from 1959 and the Blu-ray I have for it makes it look like it was made this year. Specifically, my issues are:<br /><br />1. Intro sequence: I see uneven blue bleeding at the corners, washed-out grayish band-lines on shots of the Enterprise - even the credits looks faded and blurry. This is sharply contrasted to the really crisp DVD intro sequence - a crisp image of Saturn, a perfect 'TNG' logo in the 'TNG' font, then a 'system boot' sequence that loads up beautifully - and crisp.<br />2. An annoying combing effect appears during high-contrast scenes that are in motion (black horizontal teeth for one or two frames when a red uniform is running or moving quickly against a white or beige background).<br />3. It has been stretched to widescreen to fit modern TV's - I think they just zoomed-in until the left and right bars were gone, but everything looks huge and the colors are not very crisp. The studio really should have had a little more foresight and shot in widescreen. But I think this was typical for the time.  J. Michael Strazynski had to really fight to convince the studio to let him shoot Babylon 5 in widescreen, but I think in the end he was right - it makes the product easier to market on DVD.<br />4. Minor issue, but the menu does not have a 'play-all' feature. At the completion of each episode, you have to go up to the main menu prior to drilling back down into the chapter menu of the next episode. It's just annoying. I often watch Star Trek in 'marathon mode' - 5 or 6 episodes at a time.<br /><br />I'm not quite certain, but I think Star Trek was recorded using actual movie film - not TV studio tape. If so, then the 'pixel' density of the film can be exploited to render a great Blu-ray package.  Not sure if this series is due for a makeover like with the The Original Series, but it would be nice - It's annoying to see a planet with the same pyramid-like buildings with wide-North-Korea-style pedestrian walkways in the foreground.  Plus maybe some enhancements to the outside shots of the star ships could be made - it's pretty obvious that the Enterprise is a model - I think the 'decal' windows look a little too fake. Seasons 1 and 2 need it more than the others, but for the sake of evenness, I suppose they should hit all 7 seasons at once.ctual movie film - not TV studio tape.

B003MZ0I84|4.0|I am a big fan of Maroon 5 since Songs About Jane came out and they have not disappointed me yet. I had very high expectations of Hands All Over because of \\"Mutt\\" Lange producing. The songs are short and sweet and very catchy but not so much that it deserves a 5 star rating. Still worth every penny especially if you purchase the deluxe edition which has 5 extra tracks.
B000VN7PCM|2.0|I had this album back in 1975, and fell in love with it.  This is without a doubt their best.  I picked up the remastered CD (A&M 2002), and it sounds much better than this LP.  Which is surprising given that most albums deserving of 180G remastering that I've heard get a proper treatment and sound wonderful.  The highs are lacking, the overall level is at least 6 db lower than most of my albums, and it sounds thin.  It's absolutely full of pops and clicks brand new out of the sleeve.  I was so looking forward to getting this, and now I'm so disappointed.  Why bother?<br /><br />Furthermore, in doing a little more research it seems that most of the Back To Black vinyl series were poorly done.  From what I gather they are taking CDs and essentially pressing vinyl from them which totally defeats the purpose.  They're going to be just as thin and lacking as a CD with the added bonus of pops and clicks.  Yippee.  Capitol Valuts is another one to stay away from.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I agree with the two big reviews here that the transfers are stunning, especially Alien.    As mentioned, the packaging, while beautiful, is poor functionally. I can't get the darned discs out of their slots! I have to wedge a piece of cardboard under them to lift up an edge to grab.    Finally, the documentaries are NOT in hi-def, even the parts filmed just a few years ago. This is disappointing, and not mentioned anywhere on the packaging or description.
B00005O3VC|5.0|5 stars for Monty Python and the Holy Grail!  I was laughing at the main menu, and it continued throughout the movie (of course). Just like I remembered when I was a kid, but better video and audio quality. Even the ridiculous political rant in the beginning was much easier to understand, and because of that much more comical.  I played this DVD on a Samsung Blu-Ray player and the quality was better than I expected. Nothing like today's movies of course, but for the time period and budget of the movie it looked perfect. Any higher quality would probably take away from the experience!  The extras are ok, not quite what you would expect. The lego thing is plain silly... its amazing that someone would spend time doing that, but it just shows the extent of the diehard community of this movie.    The entire series is available fairly cheap... I'll be getting that too.
B003UERZ88|4.0|I've always loved the Halford/Roy Z combination, so I was thrilled to hear that they were collaborating again on \\"Made of Metal\\".  Z's full-bodied, razor-sharp production compliments Rob's powerful vocals and range.  And the band always sounds tighter than a snare-head, despite the time off.  Is it perfect? - no.  But its as solid as it gets these days, with a heavy tunefulness that's hard to find in modern-day metal.  Highlights for me are Undisputed (try to not sing along), Made of Metal (regardless of the Nascar references), We Own the Night (killer chorus) and Twenty-Five Years (deeply moving).  And there are a few clunkers, most notably Til The Day I Die (doing his best Rob Jovi impersonation) and The Mower (I'm in the minority here, I know, but I can do without the 4 minute scream-a-thon).  All in all, another breath of fresh air from Rob Halford, and his best work since Resurrection.
B001MEJX10|5.0|If you loved the Matrix and wanted to get the movie, and just the movie in a simple, cheap, Blu-Ray package, well this is it. No frills. Just the disc, and it is super high quality. Played it on the Sony Bravia 50\\" and Samsung Blu-Ray player. It was just great. Noticed a lot of things that I hadn't seen/heard before. Music sounded great. Turn off the lights, grab your favorite beverage and prepare yourself for the ride. Quality might have been a bit too good. A couple scenes (like the jump scene) had a bit of fakeness to them, but all in all not worth deducting a star, or even a half star.   Good price, fast shipping, and the package is regular size, fits in your standard DVD shelf, not one of those over-priced extra big packages that are out there.  Buy this one!
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|I saw the preview for this movie and thought I'd check it out.  It was actually quite good and even kinda scary.  Although it was pretty unrealistic with the unzipped coats and how the girl felt it comfortable to sleep with her hand on the ice cold chair-lift bar, but I could get past that and really enjoyed this movie.
1595141715|5.0|After finishing the book 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher, I was incredibly impressed. As a teen I was able to connect really well with the book, but I also think this book could appeal to multiple ages and gender.   The story is narrated by an average teenage boy, Clay Jensen, who receives a set of cassette tapes from an anonymous person. The tapes are recorded by a girl he knew, Hannah Baker, who had these tapes sent around to 13 people after she committed suicide. These tapes reveal to each person how each of them had affected her and her decision to end her life.   The tapes really display the emotion of Hannah and her feelings toward each person. I realized as I was reading that even I started to feel the pain Hannah was trying to convey to her audience. I was easily able to capture her emotion and the reasons behind why she ultimately made the decision she did.   This book was extremely impactful on me because I realize that some of my own peers may have the same feelings as Hannah. I found it really easy to relate to Hannah because she was just an average teenage girl with the same pressures as many of us have. However, for her, she did not have much support from anybody to help her away from the path of suicide.  In my opinion this book was very well written, easy to read, and to follow along. The plot line consistently keeps you on the edge of your seat, always wanting more. Personally I read this book while on vacation and found myself staying up until 3 in the morning to finish it! I was hooked on it, waiting to see whom the next tape would be sent to and why they had an effect.   The message of this book was extremely strong. The issue of teen suicide is definitely a concerning problem in our nation, and I was glad to see the issue brought up in such a realistic and creative story. The author affectively used Hannah's tapes to display the thoughts and emotions of a suicidal person while living their final days or even final minutes of their lives.   I highlyrecommend this book for anyone especially other teenage girls even if suicide has never been relevant in your life. It was a quick read that really catches your attention and brings you into the plot as if you were following the narrator on his journey. Each tape and chapter leaves you with suspense and wonder of who will be next and why. Overall great book!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|The song tells an emotional story of how he used to rule the world then how he went from having everything to having nothing. The song Viva La Vida shows a'lot of the same pop tones found in the band U2 and is very similar to U2's songs.     \\"Viva La Vida\\" has both modern and postmodern ideas as it tells the story of a man who had everything then lost it. Coldplay starts by comparing how things used to be when he ruled the world and how things where after he lost everything. They talk about how \\"Seas would rise when I gave the word,\\" They also mention \\"I used to roll the dice,\\" and \\"Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes\\" (2,5-6). Then they talk about how he lost everything \\"Now in the morning I sleep alone / Sweep the streets that I used to own,\\" also the song says \\"One minute I held the key / Next the walls were closed on me\\" (3-4, 10-11). I think the song is kind of both a modern and a postmodern song. The song is postmodern when it talks about how he had everything then he lost it but its kind of modern when it talks about him bouncing back and having Saint Peter call his name.     The strong religious base of the song becomes very apparent when you really look into the lyrics and their meanings. This religious base is shown in the third paragraph when they say \\"And I discovered that my castles stand / Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\\" (12-13). I thought that this kind of mimics the parable Jesus told about the wise man building his house on the rock and the foolish man building his house on sand. So what they are saying is he is the foolish man because he built his castles on pillars of sand. These lines are also a good example of a hyperbole because he didn't actually build his castles on pillars of salt and sand, but he is exaggerating to to show that his castles didn't have a good foundation.. The religious feel is also shown in the chorus when they mention \\"Be my mirror my sword and shield\\" (16). I think that this means that he is calling out to God to protect him and help him. This is also an example of a metaphor because he doesn't actually mean be my mirror, sword, and shield but he is speaking more figuratively. Then later in the song it says \\"I know Saint Peter will call my name\\" (46). So this I think this is him hoping Saint Peter will call him to show that he had become a better man than he was. The song also has a great example of another metaphor when it says \\"It was the wicked and wild wind\\" (23). This is a good example of a metaphor because the wind isn't actually wicked and wild and wind can't have these attributes.
B0000067L3|1.0|We just upgraded our stereo system with Vienna speakers and a Marantz integrated amplifier.  Music comes alive!  So we were excited to get this CD, which we expected to contain amazing instrumental sections.  The recording quality was so poor that after listening to it once, we took it out of our CD changer and returned it.
1593272200|5.0|\\"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment\\" by Richard Stevens (2nd Edition updated by Stephen Rago in 2005) has been THE standard for UNIX system programming since the first edition came out in 1992. It is clear, correct and comprehensive. Another really excellent book is the updated edition of Marc Rochkind's \\"Advanced UNIX Programming.\\" So it is unexpected that a new UNIX system programming book should come out that stands head and shoulders above the Stevens and Rochkind books, but Michael Kerrisk's \\"The Linux Programming Interface\\" does.<br /><br />Kerrisk's book is more thorough, more comprehensive and just as well written as the Stevens and Rochkind books. It covers over 500 system calls in the SUSv3 and SUSv4 specification in 64 chapters, using 200 example programs, 88 tables, 115 diagrams and 1506 pages. It's a monumental work, and it's really very good. It is now easily THE standard book on Linux/UNIX system programming.<br /><br />No work, no matter how good, is perfect, and I do have two small niggles, neither of which detract from its 5 star rating. (1) Some chapters have only one exercise. I wish there had been more. But, on the plus side, most chapters have at least one solution to an exercise. And, (2) the only treatment of debugging is a two page appendix on strace(1). I would have like to have had some discussion on the use of systemtap, gdb and other tools in debugging programs that use system calls.<br /><br />All in all, an outstandingly good book and unreservedly recommended.
0525951652|5.0|Having read The Pillars of the Earth (one of my all-time favorite books), I couldn't wait to read Fall of Giants.  I downloaded a sample on my Kindle the day it was released, and before I went to bed that night, I had downloaded the book, even though $19.99 is WAY more than I have ever paid for a Kindle book.    I will mention here that I also read World Without End.  I was very excited about reading this book since I loved Pillars, but it was a huge disappointment to me.  You can't take a story 200 years into the future and call it a sequel.  The characters, of course, were new, and it just didn't have it for me.    I was not disappointed in Fall of Giants!  I loved the story, the characters from different walks of life, and the way they were enter-twined.  If I had to make one negative comment about the book, it would be that I didn't enjoy the detailed descriptions of battles occurring in WWI.  Aside from that (and I have to admit I did skim those details) I loved the book and it was a fast read, in spite of it's length.  I'm eager to read the next installment.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|Not since Vanilla Ice has a whiteboy come so correct.  I'm in no way a hip-hop fan, but I can still find the brilliance in tracks like Enter the Ninja and Evil Boy.  Given the mix of slang, Afrikaans?, and English, it is probably best to watch the music videos to get an idea of what the songs are about.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Just wanted to say this set is an excellent upgrade over the previous dvd set. Sound is very well done. Don't expect crystal clear picture on aliens. You do get noticiable grain thoughout the movie. I do notice some scenes that have dirt specs cleaned up in aliens which is an excellent plus. The quality of the other alien movies from picture and sound of what I have seen are excellent. If I had to watch the Aliens movies this is the way to enjoy them. As for the packaging. Its good blu ray discs don't scratch. If this was standarf dvd's people would be having a lot of scratching and disc problems. The discs in this set are packaged on cardboard backing. Why could they not package this set like they did with Blade Runner. That's the only reason I have dropped a star is for the packaging Fox elected to use. It is also slightly a fight to get the book style packaging out of the case.
B003YNFYD8|3.0|I am a huge fan, have had all their albums on vinyl, both US and UK versions as well as specific other foreign versions, cassette, and all the pressings available on CD.  My background is as a recording studio owner and have been a musician and producer for more than 30 years.      I would recommend the Red and Blue remasters if you are new to The Beatles and want a good sampling of their best work and don't own any of their CDs already (or you can settle for the '1' CD if the Red/Blue sets seem pricey to you).  If you already have a copy of the previous issue of the Red and Blue CDs, the sonic differences might not be enough to justify buying this set again.    I gave it three stars because it's squarely in the middle: a must for completist fans like myself, and completely optional and not significantly different from the previous for the casual listener.    This is a remaster, not a remix, and is only slightly different from the previous CD available.  In short, across all tracks, the bass guitar and kick drum of the drumset are more audible (basically the bass to treble balance is more balanced and in line with modern recordings) and the soundscape from left to right is more balanced (e.g. things left, right and in the center are all the same volume, where previously the center might be louder than the left and right, or vice-versa depending on the song) and the overall sound appears slightly louder.  But that's mostly it.  Because of the rebalancing of the overall stereo level, there are a few trivial artifacts that become slightly more apparent, but not anything that is new or significant enough to justify buying the Red/Blue set again if you already have it, in my opinion.      A few trivia notes for rabid fans who are Americans: these are the British versions, so the bizarre phase shift at the beginning of From Me To You is still there, no Capitol reverb on I Feel Fine, the lead guitar drop out on Day Tripper is still there, and as previously mentioned, and no James Bond intro for Help!  In the Blue set, all songs are supposed to be stereo, but Across The Universe sounds mainly mono, only the Phil Spector background vocals seem to have any kind of stereo spread to them.  With the remaster, things that were audible before are just more apparent.  For example, 3 minutes into Let It Be, Paul hits a wrong chord, which sticks out more to me in this remaster.  I actually backed up and replayed it twice to make sure I wasn't hearing things.  It caught me off guard.  I kind of heard it before, but it really caught my ear on the remaster.  If you already have a copy of the previous Red and Blue yet stuff like that is worth it to you, then by all means, buy the set again and enjoy.  I don't regret it, since I am a 'completist', but you'll need to decide how much it's worth to you.    (I'm posting this same review under both Red and Blue sets, because the content largely applies to both.)    I forgot to mention something in my Red remaster review: the packaging is also squarely in the middle (three stars), part improvement and part disaster.  New liner notes (improvement), nice pictures (though the same pictures were in the previous release, which was an improvement from vinyl which only had 1 interior photo, but not an improvement from the prior CD release) and they've finally corrected the hideous sliced Apple from the previous release and are using the original, correct artwork (improvement).  But like all the remasters, you have to grab the edge of the CDs to get them out, which obviously puts dirt on the disk where you don't want it (disaster).
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I only use my kindle for text to speech. Sometimes in my excitement I miss the little mention that the publisher has chosen not to let me use the product this way. I have then paid for something that is useless for me. The publisher arbitrarily chose to disable this feature, it makes no impact on them, but for me it's the difference between an enjoyable book and a waste of money.<br /><br />I eventually got the book through other means and enjoyed it well enough. It wasn't edifying or memorable, but at least it was interesting and provided a somewhat fresh perspective on a global-scale zombie outbreak. In reading this and the Zombie Survival Guide, I get the feeling that Max Brooks pulls a lot of stuff off the top of his head, and his books would benefit from a greater degree of authenticity that comes with more thorough research, something sorely needed in taking a supernatural situation and making it believable. I'm talking about details of combat medicine, traumatic stress, cultural and geographic specificity, fleshed-out characters. Like the animated corpses that shamble through this narrative, I want something to sink my teeth into.

B004132HZS|3.0|Disagreeing with most other reviewers, I watched the first episode and was disappointed. The title, \\"A Study in Pink\\", should have prepared me, a weak attempt at pseudo-originality that ultimately mocked Doyle's original. Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes, being a combination of Bart Simpson and Keith Olbermann, fell short of the mark. Having gained respect for the British talent at creating quality mysteries, I expected better. A star was added for Watson. Martin Freeman's portrayal of the good doctor shined and will bring me back for the other episodes. This is the Watson Doyle created. It will take all the Afghan veteran's skills to make this dog bark.
B001KVZ6LQ|1.0|More than 3/4 of the reviews listed here are reviews of a DVD release--or a VHS release. VERY FEW are for the KING KONG BLU RAY BOOK. This blu ray version has been listed on Amazon for at least a year, and not as a pre-order. The official blu ray release wasn't until September 2010--How does this happen? I buy EVERYTHING from Amazon, and this is the first time I've been afraid of what I'd get. A poor-quality blu-ray that was somehow produced (bootlegged??) prior to the 2010 release?  To show \\"270 reviews\\"  on the product listing and then have more than 3/4 of those reviews be for a totally different product is DISHONEST! Shame on Amazon!

B0013FDM7E|4.0|There is a theme that runs through many horror films: the monster is initially welcomed as a wonder, then feared and reviled as its true nature becomes apparent. Attempts to destroy it fail, but an uneasy detente is reached by the end. I Am Legend is a fascinating instantiation of this theme, saved from being a takeoff on 28 Days Later by its deep exploration of loneliness and humanness.<br /><br />The genetically engineered virus that cured cancer mutated into something that deprived its victims of their skin pigmentation and their ability to control their survival impulses. Those that survive its 90% kill rate turn into dark-seekers, creatures whose skin burns at the touch of light, and whose carnivorous urges compel them to feed on any living animal, including humans. But some intelligence remains; they can set traps, act in coordinated fashion while hunting, train infected dogs to assist them in the kill, catch the eye of a man standing in the sunlight and give a look that says, \\"you win this one, but wait until dark.\\" We are brought to wishing that they didn't have minds any longer, so hideous their existence, but they do have minds, and the thought of being one of those millions who didn't die is worse than death.<br /><br />Just one percent of the human population is immune to this virus, and one of them is Robert Neville [Will Smith], an Army virologist who finds himself at the epicenter of the outbreak, Long Island. He has no reason to go on. His family was killed trying to evacuate the Island; he broadcasts a call to any other unaffected human and waits every day on the pier at midday for those who hear it to come to him. But no one ever does. But Robert has a will to survive, and that will must be given some purpose, so he constructs a basement lab and continues the search for a cure, accompanied only by his dog, Samantha.<br /><br />I Am Legend is far from perfect. It is, after all, yet another good-scientist-does-evil-by-unleashing-a-virus-that-creates-cannibalistic-humans flick. But it is also about sanity, the human need to have purpose and companionship, the scientist who finds that he also needs faith. Mix those all together, and you have quite an interesting movie.ck.

0345479092|5.0|I bought this book after giving birth to my second child.  It was a life-saver!  Even though it was tough at first to implement Tracy Bogg's ideas (especially getting the baby to fall asleep without a crutch such as swing), it was definitely worth it once I got it to work.  It also gave me some \\"me\\" time.  To this day, my second child is a very solid sleeper and falls asleep easily.  My only regret is not reading it earlier.  I would highly recommend it to others.
B004097IKW|3.0|The Met's HD broadcasts have been going on long enough that their mongrel offspring are turning up in other parts of the globe. A 2009 PURITANI from Bologna shows a clear influence in its cinematic aspirations and specific camera angles and movements. It lacks the Met's high polish, though -- the editing inflicts some poor sequencing, and a camera behind the singers looking out into the house is a mistake, as the orchestra pit and conductor are incorporated into shots, inimical to a viewer's involvement in the drama. The sound recording has zero theatrical resonance, achieving a level of dryness that calls to mind the old Studio 8H. That clinical closeness is just what the Bologna Orchestra and Chorus do not need; their work does nothing to counter their reputation as a third-rate ensemble, and one could hear better playing and choral singing in almost any medium-sized North American city with an opera company. The problem is not obvious wrong notes or poor tunings as much as a generalized \\"blatant\\" quality: crude balances, ensembles that begin with a shudder or an unwritten staggered entrance, dynamics that are restricted to loud and soft without a range of hues in between,  earthbound phrasing, and a lack of the ease and technical security that make finer points of rubato possible. As such, it is difficult to say much about the work of conductor Michele Mariotti, 30 years old and as photogenic as the people on the stage. It isn't a distinguished reading, but distinction may not have been possible with these scrawny strings, anemic winds, and diffident brass as a starting point.<br /><br />Pier'Alli's production could be described as moodiness on a budget. No matter the emotional or dramatic content, whether the action is supposed to be indoors or outdoors, every scene is played as if in deep night. Sets are utilitarian, although there are two good atmospheric events: stage fog at the opening of the opera and (the highlight) Elvira in her mad scene attended by a group of mysteriously veiled black-clad minder ladies carrying globed lanterns. Costumes are handsome in the traditional capes/boots (men) and gowns (women) period-accurate fashion. Blocking is unambitious -- principals and chorus tend to line up in rigidly formal patterns. At various points in the opera, one half-expects them to start moralizing at the audience (as in the endings of DON GIOVANNI and THE RAKE'S PROGRESS).<br /><br />The one clearly world-class contribution, and surely the reason for Decca's involvement, is that of the Peruvian superstar tenor Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez as Arturo. If this is not one of his greatest performances (a labored quality creeps in here and there), it is a strong and characteristic one, with his trademark bright tone, quick and tight vibrato, and elegant address. His soprano partner, Nino Machaidze, has a decent technique that at moments is better than decent, but she's a curiously unsympathetic Elvira, partly but not entirely due to her brittle and colorless vocal quality. That may not have counted against her so strongly were it not for a remote and studied stage presence. In the first act, she seems to be marking time until the mad scene, and it's telling that her most appealing moment in all of nearly three hours is the one in which she breaks character (bashfully smiling following a stage kiss with Fl&oacute;rez and a protracted ovation, amidst Elvira's epic mental-health fluctuations in Act III). Mostly she keeps us at arm's length with gestures of the rote semaphore variety.<br /><br />There is more of the same from the third point of the love triangle, baritone Gabriele Viviani (the one principal whose name is left off the package's front cover and spine). Viviani acts primarily by reaching out with his right arm. When he really wants us to know he's feeling something deeply, he reaches out with his right arm *and* closes his eyes. He is one of the more handsome figures one will see on an opera video. Like every other manin this production (including even the front-line choral ones), he has thick, glossy hair and rocks a goatee. He also has a pretty vocal tone, but like many a baritone in this part, he can do no more than feint at the rudimentary florid demands of his Act I aria. Throughout, he makes the pitches but lacks vocal weight, especially in the part's lower third, where he's almost inaudible. His featherweight baritone and the quasi-baritonal bass of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (a fine Dulcamara, Leporello, and Mozart Figaro on other DVDs) come to a predictable effect in the big Act II duet. D'Arcangelo comes closest to Fl&oacute;rez for artistry and savvy, thoughtfully plotting out his lines, but he is less than convincing as a gray eminence. When this Uncle Giorgio thunders, \\"My hand has not yet grown cold!\\" one is apt to think: \\"No kidding.\\" There is a very pleasant bonus: a firmly vocalized and dramatically potent Enrichetta from mezzo Nadia Pirazzini, all but stealing the show for that character's half of one scene.<br /><br />PURITANI has not yet been lucky on video. Admittedly, Bellini in general is difficult to realize in theatrically dynamic ways -- his operas, for all the beauty of their music, tend toward formal stasis on the stage. This does not excuse the major shortcomings of all three DVDs I have seen. Each production seems to have been built around an international star, and much of what surrounds the star reeks of \\"whatever we could get.\\" From 2001, the Liceu/TDK's Edita Gruberova has a stylistic authority out of the reach of either competing Elvira, but she is heard in the extreme maturity of a long career. Maestro Haider is the strongest conductor of the three, and the tenor (Jos&eacute;  Bros) rivals Fl&oacute;rez for security if not charisma. But the baritone is a scowling stiff with a good voice, and the bass is weak in all respects. The Liceu production attempts the most of the three dramatically, but is marred by misjudgments (e.g. Riccardo holding his sword at Giorgio's throat). From 2007, the Met/DG boasts one of the world's great opera orchestras, but this was one of the most unfortunate Met broadcasts in 30+ years of same -- the production is old and shows it; Maestro Summers's vacuous strumming along in the pit betrays a poverty of imagination and initiative; Anna Netrebko's florid technique is not nearly up to Elvira's demands, even if her dramatic involvement and physical glamour are ideal; and the male cast is dismal across the board, the whimpering tenorino being the most debilitating principal in any of the three performances. The 2009 Bologna reviewed here has the worst orchestra by some measure, but the best tenor and bass by an equal measure. Its other cast members at least are not difficult to endure. These qualifications and the opening of some cuts (this performance runs 15 minutes longer than the Liceu's and 25 minutes longer than the Met's) give the new Decca an edge, although I declare it the best available PURITANI DVD without much enthusiasm. For greatness in this opera -- anything approaching the sustained dramatic intensity of Callas and Di Stefano under Serafin (EMI); the uniform vocal splendor of Sutherland, Pavarotti, Cappuccilli, and Ghiaurov on the second Bonynge recording (Decca); and the fastidious and vividly atmospheric conducting of Muti with Caball&eacute; and Kraus (EMI) -- return to your CD collection.n the front-line choral ones), he has thick, glossy hair and rocks a goatee.

0515123447|1.0|I picked up this book after seeing a piece about the author on theCBS Sunday Morning show. If you saw the same piece and are tempted to buy it, I am going to do you a favor. This may not be the worst book you will ever read. It will be very high on the list. Unless you are accustomed to scouring the fiction lists of the vanity publishers, I cannot imagine you will find a more ridiculous, implausible or poorly researched mystery any where. Supposedly set in strange little Stepford like town a short drive  from Atlanta, it must actually be set in some new corner of The Twilight Zone.    I am now going to spoil the plot flor you. Believe me,you will thank me later.    As Rod Serling would say,    ITtEM: A senior Treasury Department official is murdered while in said Georgia town, alone, investigating an enormous counterfeiting scheme. His prints are sent to and identified by Washington, however, they send no one down. Not a single,teensy weensy FBI agent to investigate and the investigation is left for a week in the hands of the partially corrupt 8 man police department of the town.    ITEM: Said Treasury agent's lover/assistant/secretary is murdered and body left in the baggage service area of Hartsfield    Airport. Again no Federal, State or Atlanta police involvement is noted, either at the time or subsequently.    ITEM: A massive accident is caused on the Interstate to Augusta by our hero. He shoots three people in the vicinity of the accident which also induces a shower of 100,000 single dollar bills on the roadway and escapes from this witnessed holocaust in a....(you will really love this)  BENTLEY. Several hours later he returns by the same road in the same Bentley and notices that they haven't yet finished clearing up the accident.  No roadblocks, no investigations, no news coverage. Just cleanup.    And the amazing thing is that an actual editor at an actual an actual publishing house put this together and released it. And people buy it, and it's sequels, andaccording to the CBS piece think this hero is a wonderful example of how life should be lived. Just make up anything, no relation to facts or possibility, and totally suspend your ability to think while you fantasize about how it might be. Come to think of it, that's how we got Sarah Palin, isn't it?
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Fall of Giants by Ken Follett is an amazing book.  As a teacher of International Affairs, I would recommend this book as a must read for students of World Politics.  Fall of Giants provides rich characters living through the challenging times of the period through World War I from the perspective of Russians, Germans, French, English, American and Welsh.  Never have I read a more appealing, well researched observation of the period.  The stories are engrossing, down to earth, and let the reader see events from various national and cultural points of view.  Different from any history book, Fall of Giants brings the loves, conflicts, fears, class beliefs all into understanding.  This book is a treasure!  Still, I must add, considerably overpriced for Kindle.
B000W11JGG|5.0|A bunch of these songs have become entrenched in our culture.  Radio and movie staples.  I recently rented the movie, \\"27 Dresses\\" that dedicates a whole bar scene to the fact that although everyone knows the song, most people don't know the words to \\"Bennie and the Jets.\\"  \\"Candle in the Wind\\" has been a hit in three different decades.  The hits are plentiful here, no doubt.  But, I would urge any newcomer to the album to dig a little deeper.  The theme of the hits here tend to be about the trappings of fame and success.  The title track ponders if he should go back to a simpler life.  \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" is a mythical pop band, and \\"Candle in Wind\\" is a great look at how fame played a tragic role in the demise of Marilyn Monroe.  As good as these songs get, most of us aren't grappling with the effects of fame.  So, dig deeper.  The album has got other great characters and portraits sitting just beyond the famous tracks.  \\"All The Young Girls Love Alice\\" is a brave look at sexual identity and abuse, particularly when you realize it was written in the early seventies.  \\"Social Disease\\" takes a jab at a simpler, struggling character.  \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" is a strong song lyrically that wraps itself around a melody out of what feels like the twenties or thirties.  It manages to place you on a boardwalk from a whole other era.  So, dig deeper.  This one is so much more than its hits.<br /><br />Chris Bowen<br />Author of, [[ASIN:1432724533 Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom]]

B000001ELD|4.0|While most KISS fans (including myself) believe that the best album to be born from the 1978 KISS solo efforts was the \\"Ace Frehley\\" album, I have to say that Gene Simmons' project deserves the title of \\"most surprising.\\"  Judging by the album cover, most fans would expect to have a dark, almost evil sounding album waiting for them.  Instead, the listener gets a wonderful mix of signature dirty Gene Simmons tunes, slow and pop rockers, one really cool tribute song, a \\"mulligan\\" from KISS' catalogue, and one song that shouldn't belong but works marvelously on this album.<br /><br />The album opens ominously enough, with wicked strings and vocals that get the listener ready for what should be a brutal metal onslaught.  What you get instead is the hard pop rocker \\"Radioactive.\\"  That's followed up by another pop rocker in \\"Burning Up With Fever.\\"<br /><br />It's the third track on this album that shows the listener that Gene's mind isn't geared strictly to up-tempo rock and dirty songs.  \\"See You Tonite\\" sounds as if Paul (McCartney, not Stanley) should be singing it instead of Gene Simmons.  I have to admit that it is a wonderful song, and that's being said by someone who doesn't even really like the Beatles.  There's just something about the track that makes it really easy to listen to over and over again.  Two other tracks on the album also have a heavily Beatles-influenced sound to them, those being \\"Always Near You/Nowhere To Hide\\" and \\"Mr. Make Believe.\\"<br /><br />If \\"See You Tonite\\" or any of the other Beatles-esque tunes derail the average KISS listener, \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" will bring them back home.  It's a signature dirty track from the signature dirty guy from KISS.  This song would easily fit into a standard KISS album alongside tracks such as \\"Calling Dr. Love.\\"  Another excellent dirty track on the album is \\"Living In Sin,\\" which features Cher (yep, THAT Cher) near the end of the track as a young lady nervously calling Gene's hotel room.<br /><br />The song \\"Man Of 1,000 Faces\\" is supposedly a nod to horror great Lon Chaney.  This makes perfect sense given the fact that Simmons is a huge classic horror fan.  The influence of Paul, John, George, and Ringo can be  heard in this song, but in my opinion it isn't as strong as it is in the aforementioned tunes.<br /><br />Two other songs fill out the album.  One is pop rocker \\"True Confessions\\" and the other is a \\"do-over\\" of \\"See You In Your Dreams\\" from KISS' wonderful \\"Rock And Roll Over\\" album.  Supposedly Gene wasn't happy with the cut from that album and did it again for his solo project.  Personally, I enjoy both of them about the same.<br /><br />Finishing off the album is the song that has caused almost as many arguments in KISS fan circles as the debate over who was really the heart of the original KISS lineup.  \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" from Walt Disney's 1940 classic animated film, \\"Pinocchio,\\" finds us hearing Gene do an excellent (if you ask me) job of singing the classic tune in a straight cover.  Many people believe that Simmons recorded the song as a joke, but I personally think that he recorded it due to the fact that the song personifies the American dream of becoming a success no matter where you find yourself in life.  Call it cheesy, but the song is very uplifting and finishes off the most eclectic KISS solo project perfectly.<br /><br />Fans of KISS probably already own this album.  For the rest of the people on this planet, buy this album to hear the Demon doing his darndest to make a wonderful pop/hard rock album with a tad bit of inspiration at the end.<br /><br />Highly recommended.sedly a nod to horror great Lon Chaney.

1593272782|4.0|Overall this is a wonderful series from Mr.Isogawa. All pictures, no text, love that.  The paper and print for this book is top-notch.    Only thing missing is that it does not have the instruction about how to get the required parts.  To sort out the part list and order them one by one from LEGO will cost a lot of time.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|Okay, fine. Most viewers seem to dislike this movie. We own 3 copies of the regular DVD. Why? We have 3 DVD players in different rooms, we love the filming of Ultraviolet, and we sure do enjoy Milla Jovovich's acting ability. Plus, Milla's outfits are cute.     We are getting the Blu-ray in a few days...just because we own a Blu-ray player and want to see how it looks.    This is a fine-tuned story. It certainly makes sense to us. It's on-going, fast-paced, exciting, colorful and filmed in a location we would love to see first-hand.    Mr. Wong said it all in his short, but to-the-point, review. He titled his review as Blah. Probably because he couldn't stand the bad reviews. If so, we can't blame him. What could there be not to like?     For 77 viewers to rate this movie as a 1 Star is the most outlandish thing we have ever seen. It's like rating a MarketPlace Seller with a 1 Star because you hated the story in the book.    We certainly don't mean to bash anyone on the head with a hammer, but this movie is truly \\"Beautiful\\" as the word is defined in the dictionary. But then, beauty is absolutely in the eye of the beholder.    Thank you for reading and listening. Hope we don't make enemies.
B003UESJJC|4.0|Like another reviewer I have had to return 2 sets to Amazon.com because of the three discs disc 1 will not load.

I picked up the 2 disc version at Costco today and it loaded fine...so I guess I'll miss the third disc....(Hearts of Darkness) which didn't look great on the blu ray anyway.  The films look ridiculously good and finally in the theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35 which gives greater beauty to many scenes.  I truly enjoyed the one hour John Milius chat with Coppola as well as the one with Sheen and other bonus features on disc 2.  I'll give the two disc set 5 stars and knock a star off the three disc set for obvious problems they are having...

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle and couldn't put it down.  The story captured you from beginning to end.  It is not a happy go lucky book and deals with human issues from both sides, someone who knew freedom and one who never knew what freedom was.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Others have said it and I will reiterate it here.  The discs are packed VERY securely in book form in this set.  They require more than a little effort to extract them from their nesting places.  I for one would not have considered the use of a more traditional disc storage system to be in any way a lesser value in either aesthetics or quality.  Truth be told, I am strongly considering buying one of those multi-disc or 6-disc cases available from online sellers and keeping my anthology Blu-ray discs in those simply for ease of repeat access.<br /><br />Once you get them out, however, hold on to something because you are in for a long and exhaustive ride through the \\"Alien\\" universe.  There is so much content that one could feasibly collapse from exhaustion if one tried to take it all in as rapidly as possible.  And how enjoyable would that really be, eh?<br /><br />Picture and sound quality for all the movies exceeds any and all previous release versions and formats, in some cases by a country mile. And if the only way you ever saw these movies was on VHS or TV, you really haven't seen them yet.  Chances are that most people who bought the DVD set \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" (the entire contents of which are reproduced here and often improved upon) back when it was released in 2003 did NOT have a high-definition TV at the time.  Those TV's were still fairly new and VERY expensive back then.  Nowadays, a great many of us own the hi-def TVs that are today an essential part of the new Blu-ray \\"Alien Anthology\\" viewing experience.  You can now watch the same content as before except in substantially better video/audio presentation and on a TV screen that embraces and serves the newer, higher technology.<br /><br />In the first film, \\"Alien\\", I did notice that while the visual detail inside the ship is much greater, certain scenes seem a bit darker and the detail is more difficult to see than in other DVD versions.  In particular, Kane's descent into the cave, exterior shots of the Nostromo, and the attack on Brett are all a bit darker.  I can not tell you if it matches with the original release (and later DVD versions had the brightness tweaked a bit) or if something else is to blame.<br /><br />But moving on:  In case you missed the memo, there is a truckload of new stuff in this anthology that was NOT included (or even yet produced) in the Quadrilogy.  Even more content, better technological presentation, and (for many of us) finally on the hi-def screen we wish we had seven years earlier.  You are a winner on every front.<br /><br />My only other complaint is about the size of the text in some of the special features menus.  It is very, very tiny.  I have a 32-inch screen and the text appears so tiny on it I have to literally put my face up to the screen to read it.  But that is not unique to this Blu-ray set.  I've seen it on other Blu-rays too, such as \\"District 9\\".  I have no idea how this micro-text trend started or why.<br /><br />And not to sound petty, but in some portions of the bonus content there are pages with text describing the pictures or slideshows you can watch, and they include some minor punctuation errors and syntax issues.  Not everyone will notice or care, but I did and do.  It just looks a little unprofessional, IMHO.  If \\"unprofessional\\" is too harsh a description, I'll offer \\"less than perfect\\" instead.  Again, these are minor points and are probably of little or no consequence to most viewers.  But now that I've spotted the errors, I will think of them every time I think of the product.<br /><br />And in the bonus content for \\"Aliens\\" you can learn the first and middle names of the Nostromo crew in the bios generated for that movie's boardroom scene (as seen on a screen behind Ripley).  Lots of detail is thrown in, including the individual crew members' birthdate, education, training, and service records.  The writing style in the bios makes me cringe just a bit, but I'm a little oversensitive about that kind ofthing.  And the photos of the crew members look like movie studio publicity shots instead of worker I.D. photos (guess why?), but maybe I'm being too picky.  You decide.<br /><br />[End of nitpicky rant about an otherwise stellar product.]<br /><br />Thinking about giving this as a gift this holiday season?  Give it to a young person because one will need quite a bit of time to watch, read, and experience every last bit of this \\"working vacation in a box\\".  The task of watching the whole thing seems so massive it makes my head hurt a little to think about it.  Ridley Scott's promised prequel will probably be in the theaters before I can finish this \\"Alien\\" marathon.<br /><br />Is it a good value for your money?  In terms of volume of content, absolutely.  I can't think of a movie or movie series that has been as extensively chronicled and augmented for home video format as this one.  If the high price unnerves you a bit, consider it a very small price to pay considering how much legwork and how many man hours went into producing the set, and that you didn't have to lift a finger to help.  Hee hee!<br /><br />Will the price eventually drop a bit?  Maybe, but probably not any time soon.  You will probably be able to get a discounted used copy soon enough but it would devalue the project and product as a whole if the new copies were marked down by the studio any time in the foreseeable future.  Hope for it, but don't count on it.<br /><br />Wish you could just buy one or two of the movies in Blu-ray format and not have to pay for the ones that aren't your favorites?  There is every reason to believe that the individual films (or more likely just the first two) will SOMEDAY be released for separate purchase.  But given the way the bonus content is tied into the set as a whole I suspect you would not get this proportion of it in an individual release, though that may or may not be important to you down the road.  For the set to REALLY stand up over time, the bonus content has to be enjoyable enough to merit repeat viewings, and much of it is.  I suspect that the first wave of eventual single-film Blu-ray releases will have only a tiny fraction of the film-specific content available here.<br /><br />For the more casual fans of the \\"Alien\\" series, you may be inclined to wait for the single-film releases anyway.  There certainly would be a demand for those and no doubt the suits at Fox have anticipated it.  But they also want to get the appropriate amount of shelf life and reputation out of this new multi-disc set.  So once again for you patient hold-outs out there, hope for it but don't hold your breath.<br /><br />One only hopes that the massive amount of content here doesn't amount to \\"Alien\\" overload and make us too weary of the saga and its elements to get excited for Ridley Scott's planned prequel (which as of this writing looks like it is tentatively moving forward but not without some stumbling blocks).<br /><br />Finally, a little history and perspective on the price ---  Back in the early and mid 90's, long before Special Edition DVDs were ubiquitous, a small but devoted and merry band of us videophiles owned laserdisc players and cheered about the advantages of the laserdisc's presentation quality advantage over VHS.  Twentieth Century Fox released Special Edition laserdisc collector's sets of both \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\", and we collectors had to shell out about a hundred bucks per movie for those.  They were chock full of bonus content and had vastly superior picture and sound for the day, but we sure paid through the nose to find out.<br /><br />Just a few years later we could get on a single DVD and for about twenty bucks what we paid five times that for earlier, and that was to get 3 or 4 large discs that still couldn't offer us uninterrupted playback of the movies.  This new \\"Alien Anthology\\" Blu-ray set is selling for less than we paid for the laserdisc collector's sets 15-17 years ago, offers about ten times the bonuscontent, looks and sounds infinitely better, and does not for ONE MINUTE make us regret the double-dip purchase (or by now, the quadruple- or quintuple-dip, considering the numerous release formats).  If anyone has the right to grumble about the price, it is us.  But we won't.  We're definitely trading up.<br /><br />The \\"Alien Anthology\\" is the new standard for content volume, value, and for the time, love, and care that went into its production.  Putting this set together took years and a heck of a lot of work.  It is award-worthy.<br /><br />And as in life, timing is everything.  I pre-ordered this set and it arrived at my house on the release date.  Within a day, Amazon offered it in a combo deal with Michael Mann's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" Blu-ray for the exact price I paid for the pre-order.  Darn the luck!t that the first wave of eventual single-film Blu-ray releases will have only a tiny fraction of the film-specific content available here.     For the more casual fans of the \\"Alien\\" series, you may be inclined to wait for the single-film releases anyway.  There certainly would be a demand for those and no doubt the suits at Fox have anticipated it.  But they also want to get the appropriate amount of shelf life and reputation out of this new multi-disc set.  So once again for you patient hold-outs out there, hope for it but don't hold your breath.    One only hopes that the massive amount of content here doesn't amount to \\"Alien\\" overload and make us too weary of the saga and its elements to get excited for Ridley Scott's planned prequel (which as of this writing looks like it is tentatively moving forward but not without some stumbling blocks).      Finally, a little history and perspective on the price ---    Back in the early and mid 90's, long before Special Edition DVDs were ubiquitous, a small but devoted and merry band of us videophiles owned laserdisc players and cheered about the advantages of the laserdisc's presentation quality advantage over VHS.  Twentieth Century Fox released Special Edition laserdisc collector's sets of both \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\", and we collectors had to shell out about a hundred bucks per movie for those.  They were chock full of bonus content and had vastly superior picture and sound for the day, but we sure paid through the nose to find out.      Just a few years later we could get on a single DVD and for about twenty bucks what we paid five times that for earlier, and that was to get 3 or 4 large discs that still couldn't offer us uninterrupted playback of the movies.  This new \\"Alien Anthology\\" Blu-ray set is selling for less than we paid for the laserdisc collector's sets 15-17 years ago, offers about ten times the bonus content, looks and sounds infinitely better, and does not for ONE MINUTE make us regret the double-dip purchase (or by now, the quadruple- or quintuple-dip, considering the numerous release formats).  If anyone has the right to grumble about the price, it is us.  But we won't.  We're definitely trading up.    The \\"Alien Anthology\\" is the new standard for content volume, value, and for the time, love, and care that went into its production.  Putting this set together took years and a heck of a lot of work.  It is award-worthy.    And as in life, timing is everything.  I pre-ordered this set and it arrived at my house on the release date.  Within a day, Amazon offered it in a combo deal with Michael Mann's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" Blu-ray for the exact price I paid for the pre-order.  Darn the luck!
B003V5PPZG|4.0|Nice album by Linkin Park. Arrived a week earlier than expected incidentally a day before my birthday. Thanks!
0307454541|3.0|I've read hundred of mysteries and serial killer type stories in the vein of CSI and \\"Criminal Minds\\".  I thought there was good character development in this book; the length-644 pages in paperback leaves a little to be desired. The build-up was good; the ending rather weak.  I guessed the culprit rather early on! There is actually only one reference to the fact Salander has a dragon tat, so how it rates as the title to the story is dubious. I read the German language version also. That title translates: \\"Forgiveness\\".  Go figure.<br />If I decide to read the rest of the trilogy, I'll get tout of the library.  There are already films in Swedish out there on all 3 books with actors most Americans(dare I all Americans!) never heard of, so it means that they will get limited exposure in the US.<br />I'd have to rate the book 1 as middling, so-so in the final analysis. And I heard that there are 2 more unfinished and as yet unpublished books to boot!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003WTE886|4.0|I wondered if I was the only one who was getting tired of Taylor Swift and her lack of originality of song lyrics on her album? When the first single to \\"Speak Now\\" was released, all I could think was this song sounds like all the other songs Taylor has sung. And then I began to doubt the maturity of \\"Speak Now.\\" I wondered if she had ever grown as a musician and if we were just going to get another album similar to \\"Fearless\\"?    Can I say that Taylor genuinely surprised me with the release of her third album? (BTW...thank you Amazon for selling the MP3 download version of her album for four dollars). Taylor is not screaming as much on this album as \\"Fearless\\": she's finding the key to her voice that is soothing and not making the ears cry out in mercy. But \\"Speak Now\\" is more than her voice maturity: on this album, you have solid lyrics. The songs aren't about puppy love--she's sings about true emotion...love that is beautiful, and love that is hurtful. The songs are about cherishing what you had as a young child and to value parents (a lesson that can only be learned by growing up). Taylor is not just focusing on past relationships...she's focusing on all aspects of her life from these past few years.     Most of the tracks on this album will have you singing from the top of your lungs or tug at your heart. I'm not a huge fan of \\"Mean\\"... to me, this is a very petty song. But I am not surprised that she wrote and sang about this event of her life. So in a way it fits.    Thanks for surprising me Taylor. I believe this is the album that does deserve an award.
B003INBOEM|5.0|A lot of us have never really heard of Master IP until this movie came out. This is one of the best true to life martial arts movie ever made.   Started from the time before World War II. Before the Japanese invasion there was Master IP. He was a well known good martial arts fighter and a good man who loved to help his people in need. Although he never had a martial arts school people knew how good he was and he was the best at it. He was modest to the core a really nice guy that cared for his family and respected his wife fully.   In china in the old times in order for a master to start a school for martial arts they had to fight the best to make their name known so students will sign up at their school.  if the masters wanted to make a name for themself they had to fight the best. And in master IPs town he was the best so they had to test him if they could really defeat his style. In order for IP not to embarrass the losers he always asked them to fight inside his home so no one can find out who won or lost or how bad the oponent can get beatten.   then the Japanese invasion came. You will have to watch the movie and then you'll know how it used to be in China when they were invaded in WW II.
B0040HJNKC|4.0|Great blues rifts (Geuss What, Thank Me Someday, Let the Doorknob Hit You), combined with some very nice ballads (Stay Around A Little Longer, 74 Years Young) make this a very enjoyable album to listen to.  One of  Buddy's best albums since STONE CRAZY.  For Buddy fans its a must buy, and for the casual curious listner its a very good start.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece. Actually, it's one of the best movies ever created. The plot is brilliant, especially the part when the toys escape from the daycare place. Funny at parts, and VERY sad in other parts. 10000000/10
142311339X|4.0|I am one of the Percy Jackson and Camp Half-Blood fans. When the series ended, and saw that a new Camp Half-Blood series, albeit with new demigods, was being created, I was happy, as it's great to read not only a great Riordon book, but to learn more mythology.<br /><br />There are new demigods, Jason, Piper, new attacks, some confusion until we can get on to what's happening now with the Gods of Olympus. Their last war took quite a toll killing Kronos and the rebellion. But it seems things have skewed just a little bit - Our hero, Percy, is missing and his girlfriend and Athena's daughter, Annabeth, has been trying to find him.<br /><br />Jason and company finally make it to Camp Half-Blood, but he seems to know Latin and call the gods and goddesses by their Roman names, not Greek names. The gods have been silent for weeks and something strange is happening - Hera has been kidnapped, but nothing seems to be happening to help her!<br /><br />Are there separate Gods and Goddesses for the Greeks and for the Romans?<br /><br />Leo is a son of Hephaestus, the mechanic of the gods, and he finds the remnants of a flying dragon and he gets the dragon going again, and that is so much fun and takes you back to the old Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />So we have a combining of gods and goddesses - the Roman folks were a little more warlike - it is not just me - it is mentioned many times in the book, than their Greek counterparts, each fitting to the people who lived and needed their guidance at the time.<br /><br />The idea of combining the two is most interesting, but to me just doesn't have that spark the first series does. Will know more when Son of Neptune (Neptune??) is published.<br /><br />Any Camp Half-Blood is better than no Camp Half-Blood and we still need demi-god heroes and heroines.<br /><br />A good start, but it would be good to be aware of Greek and Roman mythology - the Greeks vs the Roman. Riordan makes a mini-glossary of some of them at the end of this book.<br /><br />The Lost Hero is good, but the first of the Perseus Jackson books was a tad better. Still very much worthy of reading and continuing the series as it comes.<br /><br />ebooks was a tad better. Still very much worthy of reading and continuing the series as it comes.    e
B003WTE886|5.0|Let me just say, her first two albums were so good and appeared to be hard to beat, but this one is even better! Here's my favorite to least favorite (including deluxe edition songs except for Back to December Acoustic and Mine Pop Mix)  1. Haunted: 100. The orchestra makes this song a perfect 100.  2. Enchanted: 99. Amazing chorus.  3. Haunted Acoustic: 99. The violin/piano mix makes this song more haunting than the original.  4. Ours: 98. So relaxing and catchy. It's like the Hey Stephen for Speak Now.  5. Superman: 96. Mad that it did not make the cut for the non-deluxe edition!  6. Better Than Revenge: 96. Love the sound and amusing storyline.  7. Speak Now: 96. So catchy and great storyline.  8. Sparks Fly: 96. I like the original version better, but this is great too.  9. Mine: 96. It was my favorite song when it first came out.  10. Last Kiss: 96. Amazing.  11. Back to December: 95. Great story but bad music video.  12. Mean: 95. So catchy and easily relatable!  13. Story of Us: 94. Catchy and great lyrics.  14. Long Live: 93. Great song about her band.  15. If This was a Movie: 91. Good, but nowhere near the best one.  16. Never Grow Up: 91. The one I can relate to the most. So sad too!  17. Dear John: 91. Great lyrics, but she repeats the chorus too much at the end.  18. Innocent: 83. By far my least favorite.  Music videos:  Mine > Ours > Mean > Story of Us > Sparks Fly >>> Back to December
B003UYV08E|3.0|A good superhero movie (Unlike the Dark knight which is a great superhero movie.) that suffers from a disjointed storyline with Ironman getting drunk.  I believe this takes away from the superhero image.  I also found this story very similar to the first movie. Can they make an Ironman movie where he does not fight himself or a villian similar to him.  Where is the Mandarin when you need him?
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|As someone who only speaks/understands English and rudimentary Spanish, it may seem odd to some that I am absolutely in love with this album. However, beautiful music is universal, and Zaz creates beautiful music.<br /><br />At times she reminds me of a stripped down Edith Piaf or Amy Winehouse due to the drama and emotion in her voice, and at times like Pink Martini. As I don't understand the lyrics, I find it interesting that almost all of the songs still evoke either a mental image or mood. Zaz manages to hit this very tricky balance of incorporating traditional French sounds (like accordions) into very cool 21st century music. It makes this album somehow nostalgic and yet fresh and exciting at the same time. I also think Zaz's exceptionally smooth vocals stand mentioning. Her voice is simply pleasant and comforting to listen to. Her music in general is a mixture of upbeat folk and jazz.<br /><br />My favorite songs on the album are the single \\"Je veux\\" (an upbeat jazzy little ditty which is how Zaz first caught my attention) and \\"Eblouie par la nuit\\" (which almost makes me cry because of the emotion in Zaz's voice).<br /><br />I can't recommend this album enough--especially if you listen to music in other languages frequently and/or enjoy chill hipsterish music.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Awesome cd. Just as heavy as the older albums. Great guitar solos and fast heavy riffs. A must for any metal fans collection especiall Megadeth Fans. Great price and quick shipping.
B0041X90ZS|5.0|This is the best live set I've experienced.  All the epics are here, plus the ballads.  It's pointless to identify \\"highlights\\" because the whole thing is one big highlight.  It was designed to be that way, or at least that's how it comes across.  All the guys give standout performances, but Neal Morse really, really shines.  His voice has somehow gotten smoother and just generally better since the previous Live in Europe release (which is in itself an awesome live set).  He hits almost all the \\"high\\" notes from the studio recordings.  Not to take away from the other guys, because everyone turns in their personal best live vocal performance to my ears.      This group of guys is special, and this live set is proof of that.  In the liner notes Roine tips his hat to Neal's belief that there's more going on here than just good tunes.  There's definitely something more; something to feel.    Bridge Across Forever (the song) is a personal standout.  Neal and Roine together really exemplifies what makes this group unique.  As a matter of fact, for my taste, Transatlantic is the best thing any one of the members has ever done.  That says a lot, considering the collective works of Mike, Neal, Roine, and Pete.     I recommend this as highly as I possibly can.
B000002GXJ|5.0|I was especially surprised at the quickness in which I received my order.  It arrived in excellent shape, no torn package or broken cd  case.  I've already listened to the music and it's sharp and clear just like being at their concert.  Thanks so much.  Karen Whitmer
076790592X|5.0|This is a book that is very touching, easy to read, and gently encourages you to think about what's really important in your life.  Definitely worth reading, and maybe even worth giving to all your friends, too! I highly recommend.
B003VWDOK2|3.0|Do not buy it for kindle,  it lacks most of the illustrations<br /> Very good book but for kindle its just frustrating.<br /><br />Update:<br />Sometime this year (january 2012), this book received an unpdate, now you can actually see the illustrations on your kindle, since I dont own the paperback (and havent even read the whole book) I cant actually say if it has all of them, anyway now you can enjoy it enough to start reading it.<br /><br />I gave it 1 more star because of the update, but it is messed up that it took them so long to publish it.
B000EULJLU|1.0|I would say read the other 1 star reviews, i echo most if not all of them. As my title says, 10,000 days is the first album i deleted from my mp3 players...seriously. I am a fan of the band, but i don't follow blindly.    10k days is painfully drawn out, some amateurish tweaking of songs from previous albums, filler, etc. I listened to this album numerous times trying to see if i missed something, just something to make me snap out of this apparent trance that i was in...it didn't happen, this album really is this bad. Of course no band can continuously pump out epic albums, especially trying to follow up Lateralus. But come on, imagine seeing this album live...no thanks.    Suffice to say i would not buy a future TOOL album, as i'm a consumer and felt ripped off. TOOL, thanks for letting me down.

B002WDL534|1.0|Ok, granted I did not actually buy this item from amazon, but from a local record store. It turns out that the first two tracks on the backside are in mono, or so it would appear. Ive tried to figure out if it could be the amp, speakers or preamp but it is not. When I play the front side it is all stereo, and when it moves to the third track we are back to stereo. When I play from my computer, stereo etc. ive gone back and forth and from the first two tracks etc and it really appears that they simply forgot to master the left track completely for dance in the dark and speechless. They also did a bad job on the end of alejandro. Im not sure if its just because the people working in the music industry no longer understand how to master a vinyl record or if its because they dont think a single person will really listen to it because its a picture disk. Either way this is pitiful and im taking it back ASAP to get either another copy that hopefully is better although this time ill insist on listening in store, or a refund and buy on amazon and hope for the best.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|This is a great album with alot of work by others on it.The blast beats and heavy guitar are still there but many layers sounds of other insturments make this great for fans of symphonic heavy metal.One thing I would like to add is the version i got was called the \\"Deluxe Cross digipak\\" which came with an alternate version of the song \\"Dimmu Borgir\\" not the song \\"Gateways \\" as others have listed or which is included in the track list for album on product page.
1593082800|4.0|\\"The Woman in White\\" by Wilkie Collins was published as a newspaper serial in 1859. In 1860 a collected edition of the chapters was published in book form. The fictional story is considered to be one of the first mystery novels, as well as one of the finest.<br /><br />Walter Hartright, a drawing teacher, is hired to teach the beautiful Laura Fairlie and her half-sister Marian Halcombe. Laura is a weak creature, heir to the family fortune while Marian is a strong minded individual. Soon Walter and Laura fall in love, however Laura has already promised Sir Percival her hand in marriage. Soon it becomes clear that Sir Percival has money problems and has his eye on Laura's money. Not a man of honor, Sir Percival and his friend, Count Fosco, plan to get their hands on the treasure pot.<br /><br />When Walter and Marian realize that Laura's life is in danger, the two uncover the dastardly scheme in an attempt to rescue the young bride. Throughout the book, a mysterious lady in white wanders in and out of the story, lonely, dejected and desperate to meet with Laura.<br /><br />Even though this is a Victorian novel, it is still gripping, engaging and a page turner. The characters created by Collins are three dimensional, vivid, intelligent, thought provoking and sometimes hilarious even by today's standards. The story is not told in a straight narrative form, but rather in a series of letters, first hand accounts, diaries and dispositions by the main characters, as well as some supporting characters.<br /><br />Since this novel was first serialized, every chapter ends with a twist to keep the readers coming back, that is not to say that there aren't many twists in the chapters themselves. As a detective novel, the narrative is faithful to the art of investigation. Walter Hartright, the one who is doing the investigation, doesn't only talk to witnesses, but also minor characters who can give him background on those he is investigating.<br /><br />However, \\"The Woman in White\\" is not a only a mystery but also a Gothic romance where a man and woman give up almost everything to be together. The author moves the story precisely, gracefully and with wonderful prose and a narrative style which reminded me of Charles Dickens. The plot is complex, twisted engaging yet realistic and easy to digest.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this book is the fantastic supporting cast. Count Fosco, the main villain, is a Victorian Tony Soprano, with the same charm, body type and villainous and cunning initiatives. Frederick Fairlie, an effeminate hypochondriac, had me laughing out loud, as well as the first several appearances of the Italian Professor Pesca.thic romance where a man and woman give up almost everything to be together.

B003TXKSWK|4.0|A great CD -- love all the songs and the collaboration with others.  Great.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I was a Senior in The College of Communication and several peers joined me for a matinee.  The movie's beginning was interesting, odd and totally what I would expect from David Byrne and the Talking Heads. I'd been a fan for as long as they had been together.  Seeing the film, the art, the simple creation of what turns into \\"you\\" being part of the set up crew, the band, the lighting, the intensity of the muscician's......that is just the start.  I know when the film ended there was one last strum and the lights came on.  We sat in silence and because we were exshausted.  The creation of a film which can create a sense of total involvement to the point of feeling a part of the film and the sheer exshaustion was incredible. My Professor was also at the film, he was also exshausted after the film. We spent our class time discussing the film.  If you do not know the \\"Talking Heads\\", don't waste anytime.  Buy the DVD, get comfortable and you will never thinking of music and the sheer genius of the creation of a music video the same.  It cannot be topped.  One group I would pay $$$$$ to see anywhere they go if they get back together for one concert.  You can't explain the film, you have to experience the film.
B003Y8YXGM|4.0|I had this album on vinyl around 30 odd years ago. It was always a good album, but it sounds great thanks to the  latest remastering on the current cd. Mightn't have been as big a seller as Imagine at the time, it is up there with my favourite Lennon solo works, with some great songs and solid backing.

B001AQO3QA|3.0|First off, I've been a long time fan of the entire series. I've migrated from VHS to DVD (Legacy), to more DVD (Quadrilogy) to BD (Anthology). The problem that I have is the compatibility of the BD's with both (!) my players. I own an Oppo BDP83 and a Philips BDP2500 BD player, both of them have huge problems viewing the discs. Often the discs don't play at all, they get stuck somewhere in the root menu. Or, they play the content in a kind of 25x zoom mode (which basicly restricts the viewing experience to seeing a lot of Ripley's hair f.i.).   With a little luck I can see a movie, after loading the disc a couple of times, then, at the main menu, choose a scene and then reverse to the beginning of the movie. Needless to say, I find this quite tedious and a waste of time (on average 10 to 15 minutes of fidgeting in order to see a movie). Of course I have upgraded to the latest firmware with both my players. I wonder how many people actually do firmware upgrades anyway, they just want a machine that plays discs!  My point is, why keep pushing BD software technology to the point where the hardware cannot really keep up? I would have gladly given up on all the menu stuff and the MU-TH-UR mode (whatever that is), just to get decent playback...
0440244870|4.0|I know a lot of people justify their high reviews for the somewhat appalling behavior in this book by saying, \\"ohhh, don't take it so seriously, it's just a novel; it's not real life.\\" But even frivolous seeming books have serious undertones and speak to important problems in our culture.    If you substitute drugs for shopping, you can see that the portrayal of Becky is like that of an addict: her addiction interferes with her work, affects her relationships with others, and she'll tell any lie she can to get a fix. Taken this way, it's a pretty interesting book, full of lies, denial, and tempting fixes to be found. And taken this way, I quite like the book. It's like watching a horror movie where you want to say \\"stop; don't go in there alone!\\" but the character does and dies anyway. You wait on the edge for Becky to bottom out and then come clean, and the \\"bottoming out\\" is a bit soft on her, but the ending was satisfying.    I think the sneaky thing about it is that it's an \\"escapist\\" book, but it actually causes many people to confront something that reinforces their reality: thinking of money and spending too much. So if you maxed out a card on your beach vacation, you may not want to make this your beach read.     It loses a point because the \\"get a rich boyfriend and a job in tv\\" rewards at the end were really superficial and I didn't like that a novel looked down on writing (she hates writing for most of the book, then uses it to get a better job in TV).

B003XKAZKO|1.0|It's amazing that Morrissey have approved this reissue?   I would have thought that a 20 anniversary cd would have come in a deluxe packaging and not in a poor cardboard thing with a boring coverart. Can´t understand why they decided to change the original blue background. And furthermore, when you look inside you find a thin inlay with about 3-4 photographs of Morrissey and hardly any written words whatsoever.     And about the remastering? I find it hard to hear any difference between my old copy of Bona Drag and the new one. Actually they have shortened a Ouija Board. And Interesting drug fading into November Spawned A Monster. I guess the reason is to fit in the 6 previously unreleased songs on one cd. An interesting thing is Picadilly Palare that has another mix where Morrissey sings some other words that is not on the original one.    I have rated the reissue with one star, for what you get for your money. It's a total rip-off and nothing more and it shows that Morrissey is quite a hypocrite thinking of what the man himself have said about the Music Industry (Paint A Vulgar Picture).    I bought the original Bona Drag for a couple of months ago because my old one had quite a few scratches. The price was 2-3 pounds which is quite a bargain. I would recommend those of you that haven´t done the same mistake as me to go and find the original cd instead of this sad excuse of a 20 anniversary edition.    Bona Drag is a fabulous compilation that deserves more than this.

B000002J0B|5.0|\\"Let's see: we just put out a serious musical statement with 'Stairway to Heaven', we can always make another serious musical statement with 'Kashmir' in the future. Let's just have some fun right now\\". If, as Jimmy Page said, that albums are a snapshot of a where a band's mind was at the time, I think this was a band, who like school children, were just having \\"recess\\" between classes. But very creative recess it is, with all the positive, upbeat melodies we know they were certainly capable of. Which is why I think this album gets too much of a 'bad rap'. Remember the Beach Boys? In between two epic lps, \\"Today\\" and right before \\"Pet Sounds\\", did they not put out a \\"Party\\" album? Adimittedly, that was done to keep the record company at bay, while Brian Wilson finished \\"Pet Sounds\\", but I don't hear anyone criticise \\"Barbara Ann\\". It was one of their biggest hits! Well, \\"Houses of the Holy\\" was Zeppelin's \\"party album\\", and just think of \\"The Ocean\\" as their \\"Barbara Ann\\"! Now this wasn't all \\"fun and games\\", we do have a dark, gothically played electric piano track here called \\"No Quarter\\", which I've only found out recently was leftover from \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", and sounds like it, as it doesn't seem to fit the mood of the rest of the record, which is probably my only criticism about \\"Houses of the Holy\\". The choices the band made for inserting \\"leftover tracks\\" on albums. Even stranger, that the \\"title cut\\",\\"Houses of the Holy\\", which fits the \\"positive\\" mood of this album much better, was leftover for the next lp? The only reason I can think for them doing this is that \\"Houses of the Holy\\" sounds too much like \\"Dancing Days\\"? I know if it were me, I would leave \\"No Quarter\\" for \\"Physical Graffiti\\", like some of the other tracks from \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" sessions, and have the song \\"Houses of the Holy\\" in its rightful place here. Just to keep the \\"upbeat\\" mood of this album going.  I'm not sure if Page incorporated \\"numerology\\" into his occult belief systems, but it would seem to me just as a casual observer, that this bands \\"numeric patterns\\" suggest that they seem to have more sucess with \\"even\\" numbers than \\"odd\\" numbers. But if the problem with \\"Zeppelin I\\" was that it was too \\"raw\\", \\"Zeppelin III\\" was too \\"airy-fairy\\", and the seventh installment, \\"Presence\\", was too \\"boring\\", the worst you can say about number 5, \\"Houses of the Holy\\", is that it was too \\"simple\\". But I would submit that \\"simple\\" in this case, is just what the band needed at the time. \\"Simple fun\\". And I dare you to find too many Zeppelin songs as pretty as \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" or \\"The Song Remains the Same\\". No, they didn't go exploring further depths of blues, folk, rockabilly, etc., as they would and did on other lps, although they explored raegae here with \\"D'yer Maker\\", and \\"mock\\" R&B with \\"The Crunge', but those still fit the overall \\"fun\\" of this album. If Zeppelin did ANYTHING on \\"Houses of the Holy\\", they explored the \\"beauty in simplicity\\". And that is why it is one of my personal favorites!
0316098337|2.0|The baby talk became old very quickly.  Page after page of reading 1st grade level verbiage with short statements, child like observations were simply boring.  The mother's attempt to keep sanity for both herself and her son is understandable but as a novel unmoving.  Telling stories such as the birth of a sibling a year prior to the birth of the child in the novel seemed inappropriate and again not interesting.  I had no interest in the story, although read most of the book hoping to be compensated by some kind of change.  It did not happen.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a stylish, and useful case - that offers a handy belt loop - which is held together with velco. If you don't want to wear it around your waist, it also comes with various clips & hooks for a strap to go around your shoulder - or attach to some other case. It is very utilitarian and non-descript looking, and can easily carry most 'regular' sized cameras or other odds & ends.

This book completely shatters the myth that you need to go to a gym or follow a ridiculous regimen to get in shape. The answer has been staring mankind in the face since the dawn of man and Mr. Lauren has just tabletized it. This book is literally the only piece of equipment you will ever need to reach any of your goals in terms of fitness. Furthermore, Mark also includes vital information in terms of survival and taking care of yourself and your body (nutrition, organ health). Live forever! Hooya!
B003EVFHYG|5.0|It's only once in a blue moon that I watch a movie that seems to pluck my heartstrings like this movie and after watching it the second time I realized that it's just as much for the music as it is for anything else.  I don't typically buy music, I have a streaming service I pay for, and even so I think I can easily count on one hand the number of soundtracks I've purchased in my lifetime.    Well... add one for sure!    I'm not a professional reviewer, obviously, nor would I say I have a distinctive taste or sense of good and bad music but I believe this soundtrack is a mix of simple, moving, interwoven, easy flowing music from track to track while also throwing in heart pounding moments.  It will get the blood flowing!  Whew!  I listened to the samples and while they snatched a piece of each song they don't do the overall feel justice.    Watch the movie and listen.  Sit back and enjoy a great story, cute characters without being too childish or overly goofy, non-talking and non-cutesy animals along with some great voice work.  Love Butler in this regardless of the inconsistencies in the accents versus the history, blah, blah.  It's just a fun, good time wrapped around a neat story of friendship, overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges and the consequences of taking risks.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is an album that I have been in the habit of listening to in the fall every year since its release; it just seems to fit the season. I had a few Beck albums in my collection at the time this was released and pretty much thought I had him pegged as a quirky mixmaster of genres after hearing albums like \\"Mellow Gold\\", \\"Stereopathic Soulmanure\\", and \\"Odelay\\". \\"Sea Change\\" really threw me for a loop, my friend who introduced me to it described it as \\"Beck's Bob Dylan album\\", which made me smirk with sarcasm until I heard \\"The Golden Age\\" and \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\", which convinced me that he wasn't that far off the mark. I read later that this admittedly bleak collection of songs was the result of Beck's 10 year relationship with his girlfriend coming to an end, which would explain the overall mood of this album. I have to admit that some of my favorite albums of all time have been the product of divorces, relationships coming to an end, or bands breaking up. Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\", Richard and Linda Thompson's \\"I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight\\", Dylan's \\"Blood On The Tracks\\", and Van Morrison's \\"Veedon Fleece\\" come to mind; all albums that could be described as utterly depressing but have helped me through many late nights and hard times. \\"Sea Change\\" is one of those albums also, and I have to commend Beck for being bold enough to follow his vision to a point that would potentially alienate those fans that held \\"Odelay\\" and \\"Mutations\\" as their favorites. (As of the date of this writing this album has 25 one star reviews on Amazon.com.) I also love his choice of recording these songs with acoustic guitar and strings accompanying, similar to the style of Nick Drake's recordings. (I read that some of Beck's choices regarding the production were influenced by Serge Gainsbourg's album \\"Histoire De Melody Nelson\\", particularly on tracks like \\"Paper Tiger\\".) This album is probably not for everyone, but in my music listening I have never been deterred by depressing subject matter, and I found \\"Sea Change\\" to be extremely moving. To me, it stands out as the album that made me notice Beck's real talent as a songwriter and one that changed my perception of him as an artist. I have not stopped listening to this one for almost a decade, and like the changing of the seasons it continues to find its way into the player every year...sing subject matter, and I found \\"Sea Change\\" to be extremely moving.

B00328G4V6|3.0|There is some good music on this album... I'm a big Jimi fan, I saw him three times when he played in Seattle in the late 60s.  What bugs me about this release is the production style. I don't have any problem with the music for the most part, it's the sound and style of the production.  The balance is good, and the sounds are crisp, but otherwise it bears little resemblance to Jimi's first albums in that the sound is so dry.  By \\"dry\\" I mean that there are virtually no studio effects added to any of the tracks. Jimi was a lover of echo, reverb, phase shifting, and any other kind of studio trickier and effects that he thought would help his art. I'm surprised that Eddie Kramer did not try to make this effort sound more connected to Jimi's Warner Bros releases of the late 60s, Electric Ladyland and Cry Of Love in particular. I suppose it's a quibble but I don't see why new release couldn't have sounded more like a natural extension of those recordings. I doubt that Jimi would have wanted this record to sound this sterile (and once again, I'm not talking about the music itself).
076790382X|4.0|I got this book from the library without really knowing anything about it.  I just really like Bill Bryson.  So of course, I was a little surprised by the format of the book.  This is not a book for me to read in one sitting.  However, I read a couple essays before bed or before reading another book.  Sure he complained, but who wouldn't if they had to fill out American government forms, saw people who cannot enjoy the beautiful outdoor weather in their car, or experience the closing of true diners while fake ones become popularized.  I chuckled and enjoyed the book overall.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie was lame.  The setup throughout was like bad sex. A lot of buildup and no release. I was stressed. I wanted something to happen. But when the release was her keys falling on the floor?  A door moving an inch forward and then an inch back?  Spooky.  Except I turned it off.  It was just boring. It was more like a bad reality show than anything.  I can't really say anything else about it expect that it's boring.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is not the typical book from Sparks. It has the underlying love story, but includes a thrilling element and goes deeper into personal lives than ever before. Couldn't put it down. Definitely Read!!
B0048IMZMG|5.0|\\"Mine\\" scared me. It was too complex musically and too familiar. It is first in the album; it is the most similar to \\"Fearless.\\" Then it gets better. It gets newer, more polished, better performed, more real, more deep, more regretful, and more evolved. This is no longer little teenage puppy-love Taylor--this is Taylor looking back and being very comfortable with herself. Do yourself a favor and check out this album, even if your not a fan of her other two albums, especially due to the $4 asking price.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|A great mystery novel.  Get ready to have your socks blown off.  Great ending.  Everything and everybody is a red herring.  Everything is true and everything is false.    Hercule Poirot has retired to the country after Hastings marries Cinderella and moves to South America.  Without his good friend and sidekick he feels he should just go to the country and grow weird vegetables.  The niece of poor Roger Ackroyd knows Poirot from his visits to the Ackroyd estate and asks him to find the killer.  The good town doctor moves into the Hastings role as the dumb as dirt sidekick and thus the Poirot fun begins.

079076525X|5.0|King Kong is one hour and forty-five minutes long and was released in theaters on March 2, 1933. The movie begins on ship S.S. Venture and Carl Denham, a Producer\Director of jungle movies, is about to set sail to make his next big picture. Carl needs a female in his picture because the public demands it, but has no luck with any of the acting agents in town. Carl decides to look for one himself ever if he has to marry her. Carl finds Ann Darrow and convinces her to star in his movie. The crew set sail for Skull Island and once there they find a village of native people in the middle of a ceremony where they are about to sacrifice a female to their god Kong. The tribal chief spots Ann and offers Captain Englehorn six of his island women for Ann. He turns down the offer and the crew heads back to the ship. Later that evening Ann is kidnapped by the natives and is sacrificed to Kong. Kong takes Ann to the other side of the island and along the way battles with a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a giant lizard and a giant pre-historic bird. About thirteen men chase after Ann and King Kong and eleven of them meet a horrible death and only Carl Denham and Jack Driscoll survive. Jack is able to rescue Ann and bring her back to the village, but Kong is close behind. The remaining crew captures King Kong and brings the ape back to New York and is billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World.     It is while the press is taking pictures of Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll that Kong thinks they are shooting at them. King breaks free of his chains and is able to find Ann and reclaim his true love. King Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State building where he would meet his untimely death. Kong is shot down by the planes and Carl Denham says those famous words: It was beauty that killed the beast.     There are a couple of things that I hated about the DVD version. First was the four minute overture that is not in the original movie; I am a giant fan of if it is not broke then don't fix it. Second is the commentary that is included in the DVD version. I really learned nothing new in the movie while the VHS version has a twenty-five minute segment on the making of King Kong. So buy the VHS version and copy it on a DVD disc and don't waste your money on the DVD version. The five stars goes for the movie King Kong and not the DVD.

B003XSSR4W|5.0|Excellent album. Excellent remastering job, with some different bonus tracks than the earlier expanded edition. However, I seem to be  missing something. There are even *more* bonus tracks, supposedly available as digital downloads. I've purchased a few other discs where they've done this (and, in the case of a recent Black Crowes  album, an entire additional album was \\"given away\\" with the purchase of the primary album). Frankly, I find this annoying. I mean, assuming the additional tracks fit, why not just put them on the disc in the first place? (I'm guessing it has something to do with gaining your e-mail address for advertising purposes.) In this instance, though, I've purchased the new remasters of both No Dice & Straight Up, and neither includes an access code or other information about actually downloading those tracks. The Apple Records website lists the tracks, and even lets you sample them. But again, I'm not seeing anything about how to download them. And even if I wanted to pay for the additional tracks, they're not listed on either iTunes or Amazon. Can anyone give me a clue here?
0439023491|5.0|Imagine yourself many years in the future.  The United States has been reduced to rubble.  And from the ashes rises Panem, a country with 13 districts and a controlling capitol.  After the first rebellion, in which district 13 was destroyed, the capitol holds and annual contest called the Hunger Games.  This contest includes 12 boys and 12 girls, picked at random who fight to the death on live television.  This is where Suzanne Collins novel Catching Fire (sequel to The Hunger Games) takes place.<br /><br />  After fighting for her life, Katniss Everdeen,a 15 year old girl from district 12, has won the hunger games, along with her \\"lover\\" Peeta.

B003WWZ1R0|4.0|This CD is beautiful and I've been enjoying it very much.  There is only one song that I'm not fond of, but all the others are great!  It is relaxing, but has enough rhythm and variety to hold my interest so I use it as more than just for yoga.  Lately I've been listening to it on the way to work.
031603438X|5.0|After having read all the other bios, interviews, etc. about Keith, It's great to finally hear his side of what happened. He's honest, funny, candid about all that has been written in the past, and tells the reader probably more than what you want to know. I'm amazed he could remember so much?? Cheers to James Fox for writing in Keith's voice. Keith, If you are ever in the midwest and have time, stop by my bookstore to sign my book. Thanks, an God Bless!
B0025VLEM0|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is a comedy classic in my book.  It justifies the zombie genre while also balancing reality and comedy spectacularly.  Edgar Wright is a fantastic director that was underappreciated for Scott Pilgrim.  All of his films deserve to be owned, watched, and enjoyed.<br /><br />I have nothing bad to say about the film itself, however the last 20 minutes of it feels a little rough.  What I do criticize is its blu-ray release.  U-control is the most annoying feature I have seen in my dvd/blu-ray collecting career.  Nobody wants to watch this film 7 times to receive all the special features.  Put them in block segments and featurettes, instead of creating little pop-ups that play during the movie non-simultaneously.  Not only did Universal fail me in this disc, but Pegg and Wright did as well.  It was an annoying joke to put 3 commentaries on this release.  If you like to watch all the special features to get the most out of your money, Shaun of the Dead will be a big time-waster.  I liked the first commentary, but the remaining two were unnecessary.  Treat your films seriously and provide fans with a blu-ray that enjoyable.  I felt like Edgar Wright provided three commentaries to annoy the blu-ray collectors purposefully.<br /><br />I summed it up before: Great Movie, Tedious Blu-ray.  That's all you need to know if you're going to upgrade to hi-def.  The picture and sound is great, but the features are a drag.  So, if you're only purchasing this disc to watch this excellent film, then for you this is a five star blu-ray release.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Ok I know what you're thinking. You look at the DVD cover and you see a 90% naked, screaming, digitally-enhanced guy and the title splattered in blood across the front. And you've heard the rumor that it's not shy to flash you throughout the movie. There's usually more skin showing at any one time than there is clothing. But this was their culture. It's historical. That said, I would agree that this movie probably isn't healthy for anyone who can't handle all the violence and exposure. Fair warning.  But if you can see past that, or rather, see the sheer beauty and artistry in every shot, than you'll be able to really appreciate this movie a lot more. Because all this is mere eye candy to help express the underlying character sketch of a lost society where honor, freedom, courage, and human dignity were the pillars. Where you lived and died for that which you loved. Where the citizens walked free and proud under the sun, unafraid. The stark contrast between Sparta and the Persian's slavery, terrorism, and intimidation serves as a reminder of why we as Americans or British or Canadian, whatever your nationality might be-if you live in a society that believes in freedom and fights to defend it and to ensure that those who live under slavery and fear are liberated, that is the purpose of our society. Not to be rich or technologically advanced, but to live our individual lives in peace as free human beings and to ensure that that opportunity is available for everyone, to ensure that no one need live in fear.   That ideology combined with the incredibly inspiring story of these 300's bravery in the face of overwhelming odds is what makes this movie so personal. We've all been to the place where we wonder if it's really worth it, if we're going to make it. Our circumstances might be different, but the feeling is mutual. It's at those times that I've turned to the example of Leonidas and his soldiers, who believed in something so much that nothing could deter them, not even death. Then I think to myself, \\"Is this problem really that insurmountable? Am I going to let it take away my freedom?\\" Because let me tell you, if you let your circumstance control your actions or your faith and belief in yourself, you have made yourself it's slave.  Ok enough with the moralizing. On to the movie itself. There are so many elements that I love about it. As aforementioned, the artistry is incredible. Mind-blowing, really. I couldn't believe the texture and detail of motion in the shots, even if they were CGI. You just have to see it to believe it.   The acting is not bad at all. In fact, I think it's the best performances I've seen from either Gerard Butler (Leonidas) or David Wenham (Dilios, the narrator). I especially loved Lena Headey's character (Queen Gorgo). I loved how she is just as personally strong as the soldiers to show that the strength was a part of the entire society, not just the military. She is treated with respect out of love: the citizens don't drop to the ground as she passes them in the street, but they acknowledge her with respect as a human being. And she has just as much place in the government and political affairs as Leonidas. Great way to show that manly men don't need to keep their wives under their thumb. And also that great men usually have a great woman behind them.  Now you might expect that a movie that relies so heavily on it's visuals might be lacking in the screenplay. But oh my gosh is this ever not the case! There are so many incredible lines full of inspiration and truth. Perhaps my favorite is when Leonidas is torn about the imminent war. \\"What must a king do to save his world..\\", he asks. Queen Gorgo responds with, \\"It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen should do, nor a husband, nor a king. Instead, ask yourself, what should a free man do.\\" Beautiful.  I think \\"300\\" received a lot of stereotype as a testosterone-driven guy movie full of blood and boobs. But it is so much more than that. If you're too easily visually impressionable to see it objectively, than maybe you're not one for the Spartan ranks. But if you want an action-packed story, unbelievable artistry, and a moral that will inspire you to greatness, then Spartan, prepare for glory!
0385737947|5.0|I just finished this book, and couldn't put it down!   It's full of suspense, with a lot of unexpected twists and challenges, making it a great read. It drags a little at some points, and seems slightly repetitive, but is a fascinating concept of teenagers being stuck in this unreal maze-world. The characters are likable, although i wish we saw more of Theresa in the book.   Can't wait to read the next one. Great book, although a little morbid/disturbing at some points. I'd definitely recommend it for grades 8-12, not any younger!

Stand outs are: New Babies, New Toys, History of Modern (I&II,) If You Want It, The Future, The Past, And Forever After, Sister Mary Says, Pulse, The Right Side. Pulse is quite the departure for OMD and would be right in mixed into a current set on the dance floor at a nightclub today. Impressive!
006112429X|4.0|I thought this book was an excellent read, though in retrospect, a bit contradictory. In a way, each time Kevin did something bad (from infancy on) it is almost as if the mother is vindicated in her self righteousness. A morality hypocrite who enjoys self flagellating herself and is later \\"woe is me, I tried\\". This attitude derived from her actions and self defensive posturing is a bit at odds with the sense the reader gets of who she was before the kid was born. It also makes you wonder why she just didn't kill him as a child. For a woman who was so broadly traveled and cultured she must have encountered films such as The Bad Seed and history books where you wonder if parents before didn't recognize a bad child they could not fix and did something about it. If fruit is rotten, you throw it out before it spoils the rest. She couldn't exactly claim she loved him from the onset. By keeping him alive and then suffering through it, it seems in a way like she's asking for it or eternally hopeful like a beaten child who approaches their parent knowing deep down inside they are about to be struck again but stupidly hoping otherwise when they should know better.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|A PREDICTABLE OUTCOME, but the excellent film leaves the viewer unpredictably enthralled. That was the greatest joy of watching. Even, like those of us who have lived long enough to remember the Secretariat races,Triple Crown win...even knowing race outcomes, the suspense and seat-edge stance is there. My wife cheered and high-fived the air...really. My heart pounded with every hoof beat. Really. I could taste mud flying off the hooves like a jockey.<br /><br />Also, I, a grown man, age 62, almost cried (in the dark) at some of the most tender moments. This story is about relationships. It's not about getting rich from racing horses, or betting on them. It's about living on the edge, living with conviction, standing up against odds, and racing ahead with courage coupled with that inner feeling of challenge. You will fall in love with Penny (Diane Lane), the gal that saves the farm. You'll empathize with Lucien (John Malkovich) the trainer, a past failure.<br /><br />You will laugh out loud (especially at press conferences when Penny is so cool), weep, jump, cheer, love, and just about every other emotion that a movie can produce.<br /><br />I'm not a horse lover nor a hater. Actually I'm afraid of the real big ones. But horse lovers, I'm sure, will find this even better than my 5-star rating. It does show some beautiful animals.<br />I was lucky in life and actually saw Secretariat in a Kentucky stable, after his racing days were over. That was my cherry on top of a horse sundae.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|The film \\"Green Zone\\" is actually a litmus test for your political beliefs.  If you are mostly liberal-progressive, you will likely think this film to be excellent.  If you are mostly conservative, you will likely hate this film. If you consider yourself \\"middle of the road\\", see how you feel about this movie - it may help you decide which side you are really on, if you had to make a choice between calling yourself conservative or progressive.      From what I could tell, the story was indeed based on historical events that somebody lied about the weapons of mass destruction that were supposedly in Iraq before the last major Iraq war, and were used as the main reason why Iraq had to be invaded.  To be fair, it is quite possible that the people doing the lying were not American military or CIA personnel, but were Iraqi informers who had their own reasons for lying (maybe they wanted to remove Hussein from power). One plausible story I read a while back is that the main people lying about the issue were the Iraqi scientists and military people who were afraid to tell their leader (Hussein) the truth that they had actually destroyed all their so-called weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf war in the early 1990s.  Although they knew the weapons no longer existed, they dared not tell the truth to the leader, who would have probably executed them when he found out.      However, let's face it; America would have invaded Iraq whether it had the weapons or not, I think most people can agree it was \\"a done deal\\".      Oh, that's right, this was a film.  Well, Matt Damon does a fine job as the reluctant soldier looking for weapons; and Greg Kinnear does a good job as the lying American political guy; and that burly Englishman guy who was in 28 Days does a fine job as the suspicious CIA guy.  Good film, but fair warning that you may find it really, really, irritating if you are a conservative.
1400032717|5.0|It's rare to find a book like this that is a pleasant easy read while still packing enough power to really move a reader. The fact that there have been 1600+ reviews already written really speaks to the popularity of this book and that popularity is well deserved. The author has managed to write this book in such a way that you can actually picture yourself seeing through an autistic child's eyes. It is incredibly interesting to learn the thought processes behind the behaviors you may have noticed from autistic people in passing.<br /><br />The book is filled with clever little bits here and there to really tie everything together and the overall plot flows well throughout the book with enough action to make you want to keep moving through the uniquely numbered chapters. This is a must read and I know I'll be recommending it to all of my friends and family.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|Like some of the other three-star reviews here, I will note that the movie is actually not bad at all, it's just that we have seen it before, meaning, we have seen several films that are remarkably similar. The acting by Crowe and DiCaprio are excellent, and the story is mostly interesting, and at times, even plausible. There's just no originality to the story.  Plus, I'm really tired of movies about bad guys in the Middle East.
0374290024|5.0|As can be seem by both the summary and and various book reviews, this is big history, encompassing the dawn of the first homonids (or ape-men as the author put it) to present day, with a chapter conjecturing about the future.<br /><br />I was going to try and compare it to some of books in the same genre that I have read, but this book takes, disproves and/ or builds on their arguments - books such as Kennedy's Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, Pommeranz's the Great Divergence, Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations - and they are all cited in his book and Morris takes pains to show how they only focus on one small piece of the picture. Indeed the feeling of reading this must have been similar for those who read Marx's Das Kapital for the first time (although the language is much more accessible and the conclusion is open ended) in that it attempts to set out underlying laws of history.<br /><br />In the words of the author - \\"History is not one damn thing after another, it is a single grand and relentless process of adaptations to the world that always generate new problems (in the form of disease, famine, climate change, migration and state failure) that call for further adaptations. And each breakthrough came not as a result of tinkering but as a result of desperate times, calling for desperate measures.\\" There may be set backs and hard ceilings, with free will and culture being the wildcards that may hinder social development but eventually the conditions give rise to ideas that allow progress to be made.<br /><br />Indeed the motor of progress is not some economic logic, but what he calls the Morris Theorem - (expanding an idea from the great SF writer Robert Heinlein) to explain the course of history - Change is caused by lazy, greedy frightened people (who rarely know what they are doing) looking for easier more profitable and safer ways to do things. And it is geography that is the key determining factor where something develops first - Maps, not Chaps.<br /><br />Now all this sounds academic and boring and in the case of the Morris theorem a little oversimplistic, but the presentation definitely is not. As professor Jared Diamond states, it is like an exciting novel (told by a cool eccentric uncle) and he uses a wide range of popular media to support his case, at one point talking about the movies Back to the Future, 300, the Scorpion King or making references to novels such as the Bonesetters Daughter and Clan of the Cave bear to bring conditions to life. Indeed the emotional similarities (and sheer sense of fun!) to playing early versions of the Sid Meier's Civilization Computer Game are uncanny.<br /><br />There is a wide range of material here to satisfy a range of interests - his summaries of the fossil record, and early middle eastern and Chinese history are succinct and clear. Especially on the Chinese side, I had to read 2 books - the Golden Age of Chinese Archaelogy and the Cambridge History of Ancient China to gain the same understanding of what he summarizes in about 7-8 pages. He discourses on the role of the Axial religions, on whether democracy was important to the rule of the west, the role of free will in history, and on provocative ideas like the Qin and Roman empires expemplifing what he calls the paradox of violence: when the rivers of blood dried, their imperialism left most people, in the west and the east better off. I could go on and on and, of course, there may be many experts who take issue with his interpretations (and his predictions) but it will definitely stimulate thinking.<br /><br />If I had to make a criticism of the book - it is that, like Marx, it is fundamentally materialistic in its approach, ideas are like memes that facilitate social development and culture is something that can help or hinder development but has no value in itself. The great religious ideas are glossed over as a product of or reaction to their times. It has precious little to say about the spiritual life and spiritual discoveries such as ethics, meditation or psychology. It may be these discoveries and qualities that will be required to get us through the challenges - of climate change, overpopulation, resourse shortages and potential nuclear war.<br /><br />It is worthwhile comparing the book to two writings that he cites as inspiration (1) Herbert Spencer - Progress its Law and Cause and (2) Isaac Azimov's Foundation series. In each case they try to identify the forces that drive humanity but Spencer just doesn't have the data in the 19th century and the historian Hari Seldon is joke amongst professional historians as the novels seem so implausibly optimistic about what history can do. I don't know if Ian Morris has succeeded in identifying the laws of history but this book could only have been written now, at the end of the first decade of the 21st Century, drawing together the strains from archaeology, genetics, linguistics as well as sociology and economics to create something altogether new and wonderful and accessible to that elusive thing - the educated lay reader.itual discoveries such as ethics, meditation or psychology.

B003DT19F0|5.0|My three 1/2 year old daughter can not get enough of the Tinker Bell movies!  This one was even more exciting for her because now she actually believes that some day, Tinker Bell will come and visit her, too.  It is so much fun to watch her imagine playing with a fairy, acting out some of the scenes from the movie, and longing to make her own fairy house.  So, not only is this fun to watch, it's also supplying endless inspiration for creativity, drawing, crafts and flying around the house!    I have to admit that I am a huge fan of the Disney Fairies movies, myself.  After watching a couple of the princess movies and suddenly hearing my little one speak of \\"killing\\" and \\"bad guys\\" and wondering why there was fighting and violence, I realized that was not what I wanted for my daughter.  These fairies are better role models and there are always examples of friendship and relationships with others to talk about (both good and bad) on a more realistic level.  We talk about how everyone is different, with different talents, and how that works when we help each other out.  She has her favorite fairy, and sometimes it changes, but overall, these movies are cute, fun, brightly animated and truly age-appropriate for young ones.  Highly recommended!
1439133948|4.0|This is the latest Miles Vorkosigan book, and while not the best in the series (That was won hands down by \\"A Civil Campaign\\") it is a good place to start from to read the series. Miles is  not just a character, but a whirlwind, that blows through all the planets and societies he deals with, and to start with how that whirlwind began, you need to go back to the beginning... And by the end, you will be different, too. Enjoy!

B00006F83Y|5.0|While reviewing this band's most recent work, \\"...Like Clockwork\\", I realized I never gave my $0.02 on this one.  I love every song on here and think this is the band's ultimate masterpiece.  The album I compare all other QOTSA releases against.  Over a decade has passed since its release and I still find myself listening to this like I did when it first came out.  A must for ALL Queens fans!
B003Q6D25K|1.0|If you seen this movie and liked it...you are retarded.<br /><br /> This was the slowest movie ever..on day 17 a pot falls from a hook..come on.  I took a first date to Universal to see this movie last night and everyone in the movie theater started yelling saying they wanted their money back at the end. (glad i didnt pick to see this, I wanted to see SAW 3D)  This movie could have been a 10 minute short and added to the P.A. extras on the DVD.  Its a waste of money and time.  When people said they liked it...they didnt see it.  I liked the first one but this was crap!  Really this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen..EVER  And the ending...see the trailer??  Thats the ending..no joke.  Only person the demon could have killed in this movie was....ME from boredom!
030758660X|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book since I am a newer knitter but it is written with patterns at all skill levels.  The pictures are beautiful & the names of the pieces are very creative! I believe next year I will try to do the cover sweater for my sister, a HUGE vampire diaries & twilight fan! Over all a very good knitting book for anyone with an interest in vampires & knitting. I am very pleased with this purchase.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've purchased this DVD to give myself a break from exercise bike (boring to do every day) so I now alternate one day of pure cardio on exercise bike and then one day of one of the 30 Day Shred workouts. I've done a level one a couple of times, and first time I have found it a bit challenging since it really exercises your whole body, so I ended up with some muscle pain in the areas which I have been disregarding in previous exercises (my fault entirely, I did level one on one day, had some muscle pain and then decided to just do the bike next day but decided to try some warm up exercises and then ended up doing entire level 2 on top of 10 km on the bike and could barely move the next day). However, after one day of complete rest, next day exercise bike, I was back to doing level 2 with no problem. One thing to be careful about is maintaing the proper form, especially with squats and lunges. If you pay attention to that, it is no problem for the knees, if you allow your knee to go forward too much, that is bad for the knees. In the beginning, do it more slowly if you are not used to it, and pay attention to the knee position. If she says knee at 90 degrees, make an effort to do it right.    As mentioned by other reviewers, she is doing 3-2-1 (3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs) circuits, exercises are good, you get no rest in between but the whole thing passes quickly since you alternate between different exercises. All you need is hand weights and  a mat, no other equipment. I found level 2 to be only slightly more difficult than level 1, and I like level 3 most since you are doing all the exercises with the weights so it is more challenging. In fact, in future when I switch to level 2 or level 1 for a bit of variety I will do the cardio moves there with weights too. There is a bigger difference in difficulty between level 3 and level 2, than between level 2 and level 1. But doing it feels great, very satisfying workout.    Some minor gripes - in warming up parts, I wish she would reverse directions (actually after doing it first time, I now know to reverse the direction at about half way for knee circles and similar exercise), doing circular movement in only one direction doesn't seem to be as effective way to warm up as doing it in both directions. Also, the number of repetitions for some exercises is not the same, so I just keep proper count on my own.    Also, since I play this on my computer, I just hit \\"last time played\\" button which just puts me on the menu screen where I can choose which level workout to do, no need to listen through the introductory part as some reviewers have complained.
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|I adore the Killers and their sound, I find it fresh and catchy. Upon hearing that Brandon Flowers would be doing a solo album, I was beyond excited. I love what that man can do with his voice and his album proves that he can survive as a solo singer. The songs are quite good and even though it may take a few listens to really appreciate some of them, it is so worth listening to. Every song feels different, even though alot of them have the same theme-Las Vegas. my favorite tracks are #6, 7, and 8. All very upbeat and catchy. Just great stuff. This isn't The Killers, but the influence is there. A great effort!

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I don't watch many television programs, and even fewer religiously, but this series came along and won my heart quickly. Every episode is truly funny. The cast is wonderful, as is the writing and editing. The timing and the rhythm of the dialogue and reactions are flawless.<br /><br />Once in a while, a sitcom comes along and is just about perfect. \\"Modern Family\\" fits that description. You fall in love with the characters because they are all as flawed and ridiculous as we the viewers are. This is a winner, a sweet and hilarious treat. Highly recommended.
0143115014|4.0|A friend of mine began telling me about this book months ago -- he said it was funny, entertaining, cleverly written and that it completely changed his perception of perfume (in this review, by the way, I'm using the words \\"perfume,\\" \\"cologne\\" and \\"scent\\" interchangeably.) In fact, after reading this book, my friend went online and purchased several of the five-star perfumes so that he could smell them (and wear them) himself.<br /><br />\\"What could be so fascinating about perfume?\\" I wondered, so I got a copy of the book myself. I began casually flipping through it at first, looking up old favorite and the two fragrances I currently own (gifts from friends). An hour passed. And then another. I couldn't put the book down! When I finally did close the pages, I went to my tiny collection of cologne, put on a bit of my favorite (Gucci pour Homme), and enjoyed the fragrance with completely new appreciation. Turin described it as a \\"liturgical frangrance\\" and I realized it was a pitch-perfect description -- smoky and incense-like. I could practically see the thurifer swinging the thurible (okay, so I exaggerate, but you gotta love that liturgical-speak).<br /><br />I can see why the reviews for this book are mixed -- I suppose perfume is like anything else, personal taste varies wildly from person to person. I haven't yet found a personal favorite of mine that hasn't been favorably reviewed in this book, but I wouldn't take it personally if I loved a cologne and the authors hated it. I'm also impressed by the fact that some of the most favorably reviewed perfumes are among the least expensive brands.<br /><br />This book laid to rest some of my own questions about the colognes I'd like to buy: Does perfume expire? Is it always gender-specific? How should it be stored?<br /><br />I have one mild quibble with the book -- the authors compare other, lesser, scents to Baldessarini by Hugo Boss no less than three times. Eager to read about this apparently wonderful scent (after all, they think so highly of it that they use is as the basis of comparison) I pored through the book looking for that review. It's not reviewed!! I kept thinking I was missing it, but alas, I can only infer from their secondhand praise that this is a scent worth checking out. C'mon, don't tease me, review Baldessarini already!<br /><br />All in all, I've really learned a lot from this book, and truly enjoy the writing style. I'm buying a couple of copies to give to my hard-to-buy-for friends for Christmas. Maybe when they give me cologne gifts in the future, they'll reference this guide.of it that they use is as the basis of comparison) I pored through the book looking for that review.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|The book was a great read. It was almost addictive to want to keep reading to find out what happens during the walk. My feet hurt just reading about it. There was a twist in the middle and the end just happened so suddenly that I wasn't sure it was the end. i was looking for the next chapter.
B00332GA8I|5.0|No doubt, most of those who bought this flash drive like Michael Jackson's music and dance. Plus the high quality of movie and the flash drive itself. This is an unbeatable deal. For those who don't like the contents very much, you can at least keep the cool Kingston flash drive. So, buy it before sold out.
B003WTE886|4.0|Like her first album Fearless, Taylor's voice and songwriting are wonderful.  However the words of the songs in the attached booklet are nearly illegible.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This product delivers.  For a 20 minute workout, Jillian Michaels gives you a short but effective workout.  You start with level 1 and progressively move to level 2 and then 3.  I was on level 1 for 2 weeks when I realized I was ready for level 2! I just started level 2 this week and I'm burning around 300 calories on just 20 minutes!  I was burning around 250 calories on level 1.  The workouts, even though they're not easy (at least on level 2), they are not super hard either.  Once you do level 1 for a few weeks, you'll be ready to move on.  It's really, really hard for me to lose weight (my metabolism is very slow), but I've managed to lose 5 pounds in 3 weeks.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone that doesn't have time to go to the gym and wants a quick and effective workout!
B002VECLVO|4.0|Before I get into the reason for my review title, I want to start by saying that it is a plus and a negative.  What first time director Tom Ford brings to `A Single Man' plays both in its favor and to its disadvantage, at times simultaneously.<br /><br />The film itself, taking place in the 60's, tells of the tragic tale of grief.  One man, Professor George Falconer, loses his lover Jim in a tragic car accident.  George and Jim have been living with one another for sixteen years, and while their love affair was kept under wraps, it wasn't as if others had an inkling as to their situation.  The film opens after the accident, and it shows George coming to terms with the grief.  Taking place over a single day, George contemplates and then elaborately plans out his suicide.  In the meantime, he has a class to teach and a friend to entertain (well, she is entertaining him) and he also happens to catch the eye of a certain male student.<br /><br />What at times can be conceived as a one-note exploration of a single man's grief (the title of the film, in my opinion, is not referring to his current dating status but more or less refers to the fact that this is the story of ONE man) has flourishes of poignant depictions of that said grief, thanks in large part to the dynamic performance given by the films star, Colin Firth.<br /><br />Let's talk about Colin for a second.  Here is an actor who is largely remembered (if at all) for his romantic comedies.  I mean, he has shown that he could act in the past, but has he ever really done anything worthy of serious attention?  I think I remember being pleased with him in those `Bridget's Diary' movies, but in the end he was nothing spectacular.  Serviceable was a good word to use to describe Colin Firth.  What he does in `A Single Man' is far more than a mere `service'; he completely embodies this man and exudes ever possible emotional complexity with a mere glance.  What is so amazing here is that he internalizes so much, as apposed to simply wearing every emotion on his sleeve (as so many actors today assume is the best way to express grief).  Firth gives a delicate and quiet performance that really addresses the realness of George's situation.  Here is a man who has to suffer alone because no one can know what he is feeling.  He has to pretend, but pretending is difficult, and if he must pretend then he would rather die.  What amazed me about the performance was that Firth allowed George to forget his grief in split second moments that presented the reality of his world.  He would forget and then remember and you could almost see the self-loathing written on George's face as he internally hated himself for allowing himself to smile.<br /><br />Fantastic performance.<br /><br />Now, onto the window dressing.<br /><br />The film itself is beautiful.  It looks stunning and it sounds stunning (that score is superb) and so your senses are enriched with nearly every scene.  The contrast used of black and white, sepia and flourishes of color on the frames is a nice trick and a beautiful one at that.  The idea of muting words and sounds and allowing us to hear the clarity within George's skull was an interesting idea.  All of it, apart from one another, is marvelously conceived but together it begins to overtake the film.  I remember when the trailer for the film was released.  It was the prettiest trailer I had ever scene.  The music, the editing, the set pieces, the fashion, the emotional relevance; it all spoke so fluidly to the audience.  Sadly, the film itself feels like an overly long movie trailer.  It just doesn't have the rawness (outside of Firth) to elevate it past that.<br /><br />That said, other elements of the film (especially Matthew Goode's underrated performance and subsequent chemistry with Firth) were strong, and the overall impact of the film (thanks to Firth) hits you where it counts, even if the ending was a tad underwhelming (I say \\"cop out\\").  It is a promising directorialdebut (Ford, a fashion designer, knows how to make pretty pictures) that boasts one of the best performances of the decade; easy.pretty pictures) that boasts one of the best performances of the decade; easy.

She has definitely opened the doors to a little understood problem.
B000OSC3GM|5.0|Other reviewers have covered this movie better than I could hope to. I would just add this: in this time when everything gets reduced to black and white, left and right, liberal and conservative, I would encourage you to watch this as a philosophic examination of what a (our) constitution means. The debate here, so wonderfully summarized in the final meeting between President Lyman and General Scott, asks if a constitution can be violated in order to \\"protect\\" it, an apparent oxymoron. It is the same debate we've seen about rendition and torture -- can you violate principles to maintain those principles? Sterling's screenplay is brilliant in its examination of this issue, and the cast is excellent.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|This is a fantastic movie! It's interesting funny and witty for adults, but I think kids will understand a more simplistic plot and find it equally enjoyable. The characters cuss a lot, but instead of saying the actual words, they say the word \\"cuss,\\" which I'm pretty sure is better for this kids.
0545123275|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I loved the relationship between Sam and Grace. The author did a wonderful job at making the reader care about her characters. The pace of the story was very slow and I tended to put it down to  read other books and then return to it. I am glad I did, the ending was satisfying and I am currently reading the sequel, Linger.

Now if I can just get her to actually follow what the book says and be more positive and send out what she wants, her life would improve.  I believe what you send out to the universe is what you will receive back, so why not try?  She also wants to read the sequel, The Power.
1607887215|3.0|This review does not contain spoilers. I dearly loved Beautiful Creatures. I knew it's often hard to write a follow-up story, especially for new authors, but I was heartened by the positive reviews, and I got the book. But Beautiful Darkness unfortunately is nothing like the first book. In the appendix, the authors thank their editor, however I think she more than anyone failed them, along with perhaps the project director. The first half of the book is pretty good, and the darkness of the story is relatively well developed, but the second half can only be described as dreadful, and in the end profoundly disappointing. Every single rookie writer mistake, so delightfully absent from the first book, is present in the second half. The story line is convoluted, and plot devices abound everywhere, almost comically. The quick, insightful humour and characterization becomes ham-fisted, full of lengthy repetitive descriptions. The overall story devolves into something that reminded me of a comic book, and I'm not talking about a good graphic novel. Even the ending never ends, continuing for seemingly forever. As I read, and then forced myself to reread the book, I found myself wondering which age bracket the authors were trying to aim for. Certainly they have successfully lowered the target age for their audience with this installment. But more than that, I think that the editor should have sent the manuscript back for a rewrite of the second half. Yes, the deadline would have likely been missed, and perhaps everyone is counting on Warner Bros' movie money already, but I can't imagine that this book will help the overall project long term. From the other reviews, maybe I'm wrong and everyone else has no problem with lousy writing and a descent into comic book-like storytelling, but I think it's a real shame, given how great Beautiful Creatures was. I think this book is exactly what happens when new authors have to write a second novel, the inspiration is not quite there anymore, and their editor is not behind them to ensure that their product is as strong as possible. Ultimately it ends up hurting everyone. I can only hope that they will redeem themselves with the third installment, although I am no longer sure about this whole project.

0385342047|4.0|I have read the entire Shopaholic series, and this one is a winner.  I honestly think she goes back a little more into the humor and irrationality that made her first 3 books so great.  Becky is funny, naive, and impulsive (which is why I love her) and she definitely goes above and beyond in this novel.  I read this one in 2 days (couldn't put it down) and now think I will go back and read the series all over again.<br /><br />If there is one criticism (and this is slight, mind you), I found it odd that the novel really didn't have more about her daughter in it, seeing as that the book is called \\"Mini Shopaholic\\".  While there is a storyline between Becky and her tantrum throwing spoiling child, I really think more of the novel is based on Becky trying to throw a surprise party for her husband.  The \\"Mini Shopaholic\\" is really the \\"B\\" story in this and I found that to be a little confusing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a great read that I will read again and again.  Have recommended this series many time to my friends and families and they have never been disappointed.

B000J103OI|5.0|Lauren Weisberger used her experience as assistant to \\"Vogue\\" editor Anna Wintour as background for her novel \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" which I'll admit is unread by me.  My goal in this review is to stay out of the pre-existing discussion regarding the similarities between the real Wintour and the fictional Miranda Priestly.  I'll also admit that my own knowledge and appreciation for \\"fashion\\" is not much beyond the fact that the pinstripes of the New York Yankees are the Brooks Brothers of sports uniforms.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs, an intelligent and eager recent journalism graduate.  Job opportunities, she explains in an early expository scene, are scarce and limited to working for an auto repair magazine or \\"Runway,\\" a fictional fashion icon modeled after \\"Vogue.\\"  (The film does not explain how, with so few job opportunities available, the disinterested Sachs secures the position she is reminded repeatedly \\"a million girls would die for.\\")<br /><br />Andy is hired as the second assistant to Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly.  Emily Blunt portrays Emily, Miranda's haughty first assistant. Miranda rules the fashion industry from her perch atop \\"Runway.\\"  The world's top designers alter their entire lines based on a nod of her head.  She lords her power over all of her minions and only allows an intimate select few, such as Stanley Tucci's wonderful Nigel, speak to her with anything other than genuflection.  Streep's characterization is a marvel.  Body language and facial expression convey as much as her economical, chilly words.<br /><br />Andy initially has no particular regard for fashion or those who govern it, but she needs the job.

006097625X|5.0|I love this book.  When I was a kid, I watched my older brother draw cartoons, and it was like magic to me.  This book explains the magic, and in the process somehow makes it more magical.  But it's not just about comics.  It's about human perception, and how it fills in gaps and draws inferences.  If you produce any information in almost any format and want to understand how to make it more effective, this is one of the top few books I would read first.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I remember watching this moving and thinking how campy and cheezy it was.  It still is, and I loved it and still do.  It's a great movie, and has a an awesome soundtrack by Queen.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|[[ASIN:B000QCS8TW A Game of Thrones]]<br /><br />I just finished the Kindle version of Game of Thrones.  The story is epic and I loved it.  There is  a problem though, it was full of all types of typos, grammatical errors, and spelling errors.<br /><br />Normally I don't notice stuff like this much.  For me to comment on it means it's pretty bad.  Someone like my friend Raven would implode trying to read it.<br /><br />Here are a couple of examples; There is a character called Dany for short.  In on sentence she is Daily. In one section,  'if' was 'jf'. There were many many more  I'm about to start Clash of Kings.  I hope it has better editing. I wonder if this was just a Kindle thing?<br /><br />V^^^^V
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is a great CD release by Michael Buble' titled \\"Crazy Love\\". This is the number 1 bestseller album & has been on Amazon Top 100 list for just over a year now. The album opens with the song, \\"Cry Me A River\\", a great orchestral pacy song with great vocals by Michael Buble' to boot [Frank Sinatra eat your heart out or clap your hands, wherever you are!]. \\"All Of Me\\" & \\"Georgia On My Mind\\", great two following tracks. Track 4 is the solid title track, \\"Crazy Love\\", a great song by Van Morrison, great lyrics with matching wonderful vocals. Great tracks follow the title track, \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", \\"All I Do I Dream Of You\\", \\"Hold On\\", \\"Heartache Tonight\\", \\"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\\", \\"Baby,You've Got What It Takes\\" (great vocals with Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings). \\"At This Moment\\", a solid track with excellent vocals by Michael Buble'. \\"Stardust\\", great 'drum sweeping' track featuring Naturally 7. The closing track is another solid track, \\"Whatever It Takes\\" featuring Ron Sexsmith. iTunes & Import CD have a bonus 14th track, \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\", a great solid track composed by (Gerald Goffin/Carole King). On overall, a well balanced release with great tracks & Michael Buble' is great on vocals, a highly recommended easy listening.
B003ZJJFKE|1.0|By now not even Joe can tell his albums apart. They're all exactly the same; ever so slightly paler and paler copies of Surfing with the Alien only with less and less creativity. Just listening to the previews got my head nodding and me falling asleep. Excruciatingly painfully boring.
0525951652|5.0|Facts surrounded by fiction.  I learned more about WWI than any history book I ever read.  Outstanding!  Strong recommendation.
B00417HV14|5.0|This man is extremely gifted. He writes great songs and plays one of the meanest guitars I've ever heard. His style is a combination of flashy, speed riffs and tasteful and soulfully played blues. He has really developed his own style and can belt out the vocals as well.<br />This DVD is well produced, with some great shots of Joe as well as the entire band. I like that they don't have a never ending change of camera angles, but that when they do change the shot, it's done in a way that doesn't give you that dizzying feeling that you can't just sit back and enjoy the show.<br />The audio production is extremely solid and well mixed with a perfect combination of dynamics and equalization that you don't always find on concert videos. The video production is a little on the hazy side in some shots and that effect is enhanced slightly by the blue lights on stage. Even with that said, it's still a pretty decent Blu-ray. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 10 for the audio and a 8.5 on the video.<br />The set list is quite a mix of faster and slower tunes. The highlights are Ballad of John Henry and the song that pulls off an impressive Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top medley.<br />The DTS-MA mixdown is superb, with all the instruments placed as they should be and at the proper volume in the mix. The dual drummers adds another level of depth and foundation to the tunes and is also mixed into the audio track very well.<br />All of the musicians are top notch and special guest Eric Clapton sits in on a version of Further on up the Road that is also well done with Joe and Eric trading licks back and forth.<br />All in all, I'd say you can't miss with this show. If you know Joes work, you'll really enjoy this concert and if you don't know his work, you'll become a fan.<br /><br />MPEG-4 AVC, 1920*1080p, 23,976 fps, 16:9, ~20000 kbps   English (DTS-HD MA, 2 ch), (DTS-HD MA, 6 ch)   32.1 Gb
B004132I4S|3.0|Masterfully low-fi indie-electronic arrangements do all they can to distract from an immense organic songwriting drought. The results amount to paint-huffing, shallowly short term highs, only occasionally aided by any sort of memorable melody.

0812550706|5.0|Science Fiction is a genre that many people either love, or hate, but Orson Scott Card provides a novel that anyone and everyone should find enjoyment in.  In the future Ender Wiggin is not an ordinary boy.  His life is being monitored by the government who is at war with a distant planet's race \\"the Buggers\\".  Through a series of events Ender is recruited to go to battle school, a school up in space where gifted children learn how to lead the inter-galactic army.  The story travels through life in the school, and eventually Ender's involvement of the war.  The story line is crafted so that a middle school child, or middle aged space lover will appreciate the book.    Orson Scott Card constructs a book that is intriguing, but not difficult to read so readers of many different levels can find enjoyment in it.  Every chapter begins with a different story line, that of the general in charge of watching over Ender and his friends at the school, and provides for a fresh break from the continual story of kids trying to assimilate into a new environment.      As always in Science Fiction, new ideas get brought to the table, and imaginations are stretched in every way possible, \\"Ender's Game\\" is no different.  In the school to practice strategy, the kids are assigned teams and sent to a room where they mock battle the other teams.  The trick to this room is that gravity is reversed and no one knows where the ground really is.  Card's words help the reader to paint a picture in their mind, which is always different than the next readers.     \\"Ender's Game,\\" will provide a fun, exhilarating, read for anyone who is looking for a quick enjoyable book.  The story will make readers think that the impossible is just the opposite, and after reading this book, they will never know which way the ground really is.
0312600844|1.0|I kept waiting for 1. the characters to do something interesting 2. to feel empathy for the characters and/or 3. to just get through it for my book club meeting. Only 3 was achieved. Really, I can't understand what all the fuss is about. My own life is mundane enough; I certainly don't need to read about anyone else's boring life in my spare time.

B00004Y2QT|5.0|This was super cool! Prince totatlly made 1999 New Years Eve very fun and energetic! He had great performance and did a great medley of songs. I will warn you, it has quite a few of cameos by other people. So if you are the type that prefers to see just Prince, then this is not for you. Unless you are cool with skipping to the next parts...<br /><br />Larry Graham was a highlight for me. He always looks good and plays the heck out of a bass! Seeing Lenny kravitz too was alot of fun!!<br /><br />This was all done by Paisley Park at Paisley Park and I was impressed by that. Maybe not a must have for Prince fans, but definately worth owning. And a must for those that like parties and funk!!!

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think about Transamerica, but it's actually a decent... drama/comedy I guess?  Whatever.    Honestly, what may seem like a comedy in the beginning when you see a man gradually change into a woman is rather hilarious, but... I'm not really sure it was intended to be humorous.      A part of me thinks the movie writers really wanted to create something that people who have gone through a sex change would be able to relate to, and for those of us completely confused why someone would even *want* to change their gender... it does allow me to see how it's probably not a big deal at all.  That is, if most transexuals really *are* like the main character in Transamerica.  This film shows that transexuals are completely normal on the inside and even understanding and compassionate for other peoples feelings.  It actually does a really great job in that regard.      Anyway the storyline is about a man who becomes a woman, bails his son out of jail, and they head across the country on an adventure.  It's not really an adventurous type film though- it's more like -through lots of drama and a slight dash of comedy- we find out more and more about the son, and how he accepts what he initially believes is a freak of a father.    What's MOST shocking about Transamerica is that it's the son who's actually got the bigger problems- you just don't realize this in the very beginning.  I don't want to spoil what those problems are- you must find out for yourself!  Let's just say, he's an interesting character too.  Not all the focus is on the main character of the film getting a sex change.    Overall the acting is terrific, the storyline is wonderfully executed because it keeps your attention from the beginning all the way to the end, and it makes you curious how the events will wrap up by the conclusion.  It's... quite the surprise!  To me at least.
0811870413|5.0|I spent a couple of years in a commercial bakery and have been an adventuresome home baker ever since. My breads were good, even getting rave reviews from a couple of pros. But I wasn't getting the results I wanted until I bought this book and followed Chad's techniques. They aren't for beginners, or for those with limited time to devote to bread. But if you're interested, you'll find something here to push your game higher.    Some people have complained about the \\"arty\\" black and white photographs, but I loved them. True, they aren't individually captioned, but they are in a logical order. So if you're moderately experienced, you'll have no trouble using them to see what should be happening.    A caution though: I bought the book without seeing it first because I trust Tartine that much. So I was surprised to find that the number of bread recipes is fairly limited. However, my initial disappointment is gone now that I see the point. That is, once you've made wonderful bread, you don't have to be content with slathering butter and eating it \\"plain,\\" great as that is. Use the \\"meal\\" recipes to make your bread even more delicious. I can't wait to try Tartine's take on french toast and the bruschetta recipe looks amazing.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you want to understand what has happened to our economy you have to see this movie.  This is the best documentary I've seen in a long time.  It is less one-sided than the usual expose style film.  It puts the facts before you and lets you decide what you think.  Chances are, you'll think you REALLY want something to be done about regulating the financial industry.   It shows what an engineered Inside Job the Great Recession was and is.  And it shows how the financial industry controls Washington.   The people responsible for this talk about it in the most off-hand manner, as if taking down the world economy for their own gain was simply their right, and we should just shut up already.  Unbelievable egotism and deceit!  Make sure you see and take several people with you.  The more who know about this, the better.
0439023513|4.0|*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br /><br />I'm not even going to try to discuss this without spoilers. So consider yourself warned!<br /><br />First of all, I really liked the book.  I found it to be a mostly satisfying conclusion to the series.  In some ways, I found it more engrossing than Catching Fire, which was mostly a rehash of Hunger Games. But what I really want to discuss is Katniss.<br /><br />A lot of people read this book and immediately hated what Collins did with Katniss.  They felt like she changed Katniss into someone weak who just waited for things to happen to her instead of taking charge.<br /><br />I have to say that I disagree! I guess I've always felt that Katniss was an emotionally immature character, and was often having her strings pulled by other people -- she just didn't realize it.  When the bodies started piling up, she just wasn't emotionally mature enough to handle it. I think the only decision she made in the whole series that was truly hers was the decision to step up and take Prim's place. Other than that, she was always someone's pawn in the game.  An extremely effective pawn, but a pawn, nonetheless. I think that most of the time, her independence was an illusion.<br /><br />That's not to say the book was perfect. My main complaint was the pacing. I think we spent way too much time in 13 and not nearly enough time in the Capitol. The ending was horribly rushed, with Katniss's trial and banishment just glossed over. I would have loved a better, slower exposure of 13 being just like the Capitol. Especially the part about Coin wanting another Hunger Games.  That's taken care of in about 4 pages, and it needed to have more impact than that.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't at all surprised by how Katniss ended up at the end.  After 3 books of people manipulating her, a mental break was not completely unexpected.
B003TML0VO|1.0|I'm a big Santana fan.  I was really looking forward to his interpretations of some of these songs (\\"Greatest\\" is a silly marketing description that no true guitar player would use to hawk his album).  I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe 1/10 of Carlos' playing sounds inspired.  The rest is embarrassingly bad and boring.  As if I was listening to an average cover band.    The singers all put their effort into it.  I mean who wouldn't turn down an opportunity to sing a song with Santana on his signature PRS guitars backing you up.  And the other musicians are certainly very good.  But this was a poor idea by Carlos and his  team.
0316098337|5.0|I thought it may be hard to read through the eyes of a five year old...it was not.  This book left me wanting more at the end.  I Loved it from begining to end. Jack is someone who will stay with you after the book is over.

I thought him not qualifed to be a male prostitute.  He should have the look he had in this movie for Midnight. Fascinating movie on every level.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Personally, I think 20th Century Fox knocked it out of the park on this DVD set! If you are a big fan of the Alien series this is thee DVD set to own!    All of the movies have been cleaned up and remastered for Blu-Ray so they all look incredibly crisp and clear but I noticed this more on the first two films, Alien and Aliens. The care and effort they took in cleaning up the films and bringing them to a whole new level was incredible! If you are one of those people that really notices the difference between standard DVD and Blu-Ray you will notice how much clearer the picture looks between the different formats!    If you already bought the Alien Quadrilogy [9 Pack] on standard DVD then the special features and extras will not surprise you because a majority of them are re-used from that set. BUT, if you're getting this for yourself, or even as a gift for another person, and they don't own any of the movies on DVD they are going to be BLOWN AWAY by all the special features, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes ... all the extras are incredible!    So ... should you buy this? If you are a hardcore Alien fan or don't already own an Alien DVD collection ... ABSOLUTELY! However, if you already own the Alien Quadrilogy [9 Pack] DVD set then you'd basically be buying this set for the Blu-Ray, High Definition aspect.    My opinion is that the Blu-Ray REALLY sharpens and clears the movies up ... then again I can always notice the differences between standard and HD definition movies and television ... but if you don't or can't then this may not be the way to spend your money.    I hope this review helped you!
B002E9VT00|5.0|The book came quickly and was in great shape, I would use this seller again.
B003UBTX72|5.0|In the early eighties I used to see Keith Richards in various altered states in a hotel on the upper east side of New York City.  What amused me then, and still does, is that in the morning the doormen in their crisp red uniforms would be taking his dogs for a walk in Central Park.  Mr. Richards, himself, looked as though he might have recently been sleeping under a bridge.  At the time, it never crossed my mind that this guy was even literate, much less erudite and, as evidenced by this memoir, insightful.  Mr. Richards has written the rock 'n roll story from a musician's perspective and, if he takes a shot, he aims it for the ones who can take it, including himself.        As he describes taking his seven year old son, Marlon, on the road for a Stones tour while he himself is a strung out mess, he doesn't sugar coat it and, not surprisingly, the years of drug addictiion, the arrests, and the close calls are all part of this story.  Some stories are heartbreaking, others hilarious and he gives good anecdote.  However, it is Mr. Richards dedication to the music and his fellow musicians that make this doozy of a book soar.   Keith Richards, superstar, is still as excited about making music, playing music and learning about music as he was fifty years ago, which is why we're all still listening and what makes this book such a great read.
B0029ZA49Q|4.0|Solid construction.  People may need to be a bit creative to wear this.  I don't exact know a convenient way to wear this.
1423121708|3.0|This book begins with a twelve year old boy named Percy Jackson, who is about to be expelled from a boarding school for troubled children. All his life he has encountered difficulties. He learns that his problems stem from the fact that his mother is a mortal and his father is the Greek God, Poseidon. This book is the first in a series entitled Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and as an adult, I found the story a bit weird. But to the targeted age group of boys, ages ten to twelve, it is a fantasy that fires up the imagination and is filled with adventure, suspense, and unbelievable and exciting events. Incidentally, the book also gives an incite into Greek mythlogy which might encourage the reader to read further on this subject.  By writing in the first person, the author, I think, has incorporated a style which is appealing to the targeted age group. He makes the reader feel a part of the actions taking place. I would recommend this book to any boy who enjoys reading about events that seem so real that they appear not to be beyond the realm of possibility. Alma Winter, Author-Once Upon a Time Tales
B001FZ6R0Q|1.0|Fail, Fail, Fail. Truly terrible movie, as mediocre as the 3D effects.<br />This one if for the trash.
B000003TA4|3.0|CONTEXT: The album that changed the music scene of the early '90s. Probably more influential than impressive on its own. This album is much more than just a catchy punk album, but a bit less than the masterpiece it is often labeled as.     MUSIC: Although it doesn't sound like a revelation any more, the ideas here were fresh in 1991. The fuzzed-out guitars, psuedo-metal sloppy guitar riffs, and the loud-soft dynamics define this album. However, the real treasure here is Dave Grohl's amazing drumming.     LYRICS: Cobain's lyrics are disjointed and at times sound completely random. However, many of the lines stand best on their own, containing small bits of stunning imagery and emotion.     HIGHLIGHTS: Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|Prince is a rare commodity, someone who can play great music without a second's notice. To see him life is always a treat. The line up/songs  were great. the camera work (as someone else said) could use some help..but this is also true on the aladdin dvd as well(what happened to the lady that used to always film his live shows (as well as the unreleased videos)But, overall any chance to see prince perform is always gonna be worth your money. a 'bad' prince song is till decades ahead of the best songs you hear on the radio these days. I just wish he would release more shows like this. Musicology or the hit and run tour come to mine. But that's just me wanting and wishing. I would highly recommend this dvd. Besides you can't have a send up to the year 2000 without the man who wrote the song \\"1999\\" since it's release it's always been a standard at ever new year's eve party....and this was the one to beat them all.
B000001DTM|5.0|CONTEXT: U2 completely revinvented their sound and image for Actung Baby. It is their 2nd masterpiece.     MUSIC: The tunes are dance-influenced, but this is still a rock band. Layers of dense sounds and The Edge's jarring guitar effects brilliantly convey/enhance the mood of each song.     LYRICS: Bono produces some of his most personal and darkest lyrics. He explores themes of sin, loss, and desperation. These lyrics, like the music, are multi-layered, with new images and meanings revealed with each listen.     HIGHLIGHTS: Even Better Than The Real Thing, One, Until The End of the World
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I was a little skeptical about buying this movie on blu-ray. Since it's an older movie and was made in claymation I thought you'd see a lot of gritty details and it would lose some of it's magic. However, it was quite the opposite - Tim Burton and the artists for this movie put a lot of effort into making every detail impeccable and it shows. There were so many things that I missed when watching normal versions that the blu-ray picked up perfectly!
B001N18HOQ|4.0|CONTEXT: Pearl Jam begins their career with possibly their best album. This album difinitively set the tone for the early '90s alternative movement. Often imitated, never duplicated.     MUSIC: Tons of now-classic guitar riffs, with bass lines that wind around the harmony. The group obviously honed their sound for a while, because the musicianship individually and collectively is superb.     LYRICS: Vedder's impressionistic style was often imitated (and sometimes parodied) by lesser groups, but he perfectly captures the feeling of his songs. Feelings of regret and loss fill the songs, but it's actually not as depressing as it's reputation made it seem.     HIGHLIGHTS: Evenflow, Alive, Black, Jeremy
1441866868|2.0|I don't normally listen to books in an audio format but I thought I would give this one a try. After listening to the first two discs I really had no idea where the story was going and was just about bored to tears. I'm all for giving something a chance but this book showed no inclination toward picking up the story so I felt compelled to stop listening.    If you give this one a chance, be prepared to commit a lot of time for the story to warm up.
B000002MG1|4.0|CONTEXT: This is the album that catipulted REM into the upper stratosphere of commercial success and artistic cred. Although it's dotted with great songs, the album is most notable for its stark, introspective mood.     MUSIC: Automatic is dominated by accoustic guitars and organ, possibly a response to the success of \\"Losing My Religion.\\" It's earthy and atmospheric at the same time, a unique combination that makes the album one of a kind.     LYRICS: Stipe moves from the absurd (\\"Drive\\", \\"Sidewinder\\") to poignant (\\"Nightswimming\\", Sweetness Follows\\") and all points inbetween. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is his finest moment and has become an anthem.     HIGHLIGHTS: Drive, Everybody Hurts, Nightswimming
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love the pureness of Kimberly's vocals...\\"If I Die Young\\" is a beautiful song and performed elegantly. It is mesmerizing. The video is wonderful. A great young band that I believe will have much success. Very, very talented! As I understand it, The Band Perry has been nominated for several 2010 American Country Awards and from what I hear they'll win a few. Keep the music coming.

Still, for a guy rumored to be one of he most notorious partiers of all time, I was hoping for more lurid details. From a musician's point of view, there is much to take away from Keith's style and influences.

And the original package for this battery was lost - all the effort to get a replacement, which finally I got,  seems to be in vain if the performance is not upto the mark!!

As a mom and long-time teacher I always had an inkling to what each individual brings to the table-so to speak.I have seen a wide variety of our \\"tater-tots\\"pass through my school and yes we are all a lot alike but yet so very different.  This story reminded me that cookie cutters are in my kitchen not in our schools.  What a humbling jack-my-jaws moment for me.  Be not complacent, life is meant to be lived, moment by moment,the present.

0500515328|3.0|This is a magnificent book.  I have never seen diamonds and aquamarines look so beautiful.  The photography is great and it is a noble effort.  However, I was surprised to find a number of serious mistakes in the book.  For example, Olga did not travel to Yekaterinburg with her parents, it was Maria.  I found a dozen errors like this, it wasn't a pleasant experience, I wanted the book to be better.  The book also is ignorant of many important facts regarding Alexandra, her jewels and their fate.  I would say buy the book for the pictures.  Let us hope that someday we'll get a great book on Alexandra and her jewels.  This is not it.
0316069485|4.0|In \\"The Reversal\\" Michael Connelly seems to have a great thing going for about ninety per cent of the book, and then it deflates and disappoints. In alternate chapters we have lawyer Mickey Haller telling his story in the first person, and in the other omniscient author chapters, we find out what old reliable Connelly detective Harry Bosch is doing to aid Haller, his half brother.<br />After twenty-four years, a lifer is released because his DNA did not match. He had been convicted of abducting and murdering a twelve-year-old girl. The DA wants the man retried because he believes him to still be the guilty party. Haller, famous as a defense attorney, is appointed a special prosecutor to retry the case, and Bosch becomes his investigator. Jason Jessup, the released man, has to be tried without the jurors knowing that he had previously been convicted and was in prison for all those years.<br />Connelly has always been a master of devilishly clever plotting, and this one is no exception. There are all sorts of twists and turns and plenty of suspense because Jessup is out on his own recognizance (OR), and both Bosch and Haller have young daughters.<br />At night Jessup is visiting lonely park sites, lighting candles, at what look like graves. Bosch tries to tie this in with a number of old missing girl cases.<br />Haller's ex-wife, Maggie McPherson, is sitting second chair in the prosecution. They have a crucial witness, the girl's sister who saw and identified Jessup as the kidnapper, but she has a checkered past as a druggie and has been in trouble with the law.<br />The courtroom sections are excellent with adroit legal maneuvers, but Connelly is doing a balancing act with Bosch and Haller, and it feels as though he didn't know which one to focus on.<br />The story rips along, and your interest doesn't lag, not with Connelly at the helm. He writes about \\"taking that dark thing that you knew was out there in the world and bringing it inside.\\" At times Bosch seems to be placing his daughter into an unnecessarily dangerous situation. Harry is like a relentless dog with a bone when he's off on one of his justice missions.<br />Connelly can slip up at times, but he never comes close to bombing.into an unnecessarily dangerous situation.

0385751893|5.0|Beautifully written in the language and interpretation of a nine year old, but still very captivating for adults - despite the fact  that we all know the outcome.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|I love this thing! Use it with a canon vixia hf s10 and I rarely ever take the camera off. Gives great additional weight to a light weight camcorder, and adds extra stability control. There's another model without the sidebars, and it appears that the top may be angled down a little more than this model (based off pictures). I bought this model because I didn't want the top curved down, and thought the side bars might add for an extra hand grip or stationary stability. Some ppl complain about the bars digging into their palm while trying to hold the camcorder. I can see how this may be a problem, but if you move the camcorder as far right as possible in one of the sliding pegs, the issue should be resolved. I personally have never found having the bar against my palm to be an issue. It never hurt, and again, made for more stable control as I felt I was holding the camcorder and part of the X-Grip. I have a heavy duty L bracket as an additional attachment to it; fits nicely between the base and the side bars.     (NOTE* If you unscrew and open up the base of the X-Grip, there's a thick threaded washer inside which you screw the clamp screw in and attach the camcorder on. I had an additional one of these washers made and placed inside, so I could slide the L bracket between the base and the side bars. ...It's a really sweet setup. Now, not only do I have the strap grip on the right for my camcorder, but the hand grip of the L bracket on the left which I use to attach my light. With a hand in both of those positions and the back of the X-Grip pressed against your shoulder, you get ultimate stability.)     [Extra Note* If you add an additional washer and it's a plastic model with a threaded metal interior (like mine is) you may have to sand down the excess metal lip so that its even with that of the plastic washer and fits nicely in your X-Grip]    BEST FEATURE! Even with the addition of the extra threaded washer and L bracket; I screw my tripod cap to the base (the tripod cap is perfect distance between the two side bars) and it still attaches to the tripod! I literally never have to take my camcorder off this thing! So whether you want the extra stability for hand held shots, or maybe your tripod isn't the best and you want some extra bars to grip and move; this is the best piece of equipment you can purchase. No Set up and tear down. Attach your camera and keep it on.    Great price, and the most useful attachment piece yet. I'll attach pictures soon, once I figure out how.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Walter Salles' gleamingly beautiful film CENTRAL STATION is one of those films that most people who appreciate the art of cinema will place in their personal library.  Not only is the story raw and touching but it is graced by the magnificence of actress Fernanda Montenegro who continues to be Brazil's finest actress both on stage and on film.  The story is a bit disturbing at first: Do&ntilde;a Dora is an elderly educated woman, with a history of turning to grifting for life support, sit in the Central Station and makes her money by writing letters dictated to her by the illiterate people who line up for her services - but Do&ntilde;a Dora often trashes the letters after collecting her fee.  Into her life enters Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira),  a young kid who witnessed the death of his other and is searching for his father. Josue is world wise and sees Do&ntilde;a Dora for what she is - a con artist.  But the old lade takes Josue home on the superficial disguise that she will help him only to later sell him to the illegal adoption racketeers for money. After being paid for her sale, her friend Irene (Marilia Pera) informs her of what likely will be Josue's fate and knowing that she cannot right her wrong without returning the trafficker's fee, she escapes her home, taking Josue on the road to find his father.  The 'road trip' results in a mutual respect and love between the two - Do&ntilde;a Dora softens, having made a kind change in her life, and Josue gains the feeling of love for the mother he has lost.<br /><br />Walter Salles understands emotion, when to allow the tragedies to emerge and subside and also how to credibly introduce the change of philosophy of his actors. The cinematography by Walter Carvalho captures both the claustrophobia of Rio de Janeiro as well as the desolation of the raw uninhabited lands outside the city where the strange couple go.  But the real reason for the success of this film is the multifaceted sensitive portrayal of Do&ntilde;a Dora by Fernanda Montenegro - a performance that has and will continue to make film history.  Grady Harp, October 10nce that has and will continue to make film history.  Grady Harp, October 10

B001992NW4|3.0|I've never known of any other movie to be so notoriously regarded as The Exorcist, surpassing the hysteria of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Evil Dead as a film that was just too horrifying for mass public consumption. It had been \\"banned\\" in the UK for decades (actually, Warner just never submitted it to the then very strict BBFC) and finally saw the light of day around 1999. I liked it at first, but now, viewing it older, wiser and a lot more jaded I can't imagine why people took offense to this.<br /><br />It's useless reciting the plot, you all know it. But I'll just boil it down to a single sentence \\"Little girl possessed by low-rent demon\\". That's right...Demon, not Devil. Said Demon (Pazuzu) apparently has psychic and telekinetic powers but never uses them to escape from the confines of the bedroom for some reason.<br /><br />Doctors are baffled as to why little Reagan is acting up and recommend an exorcism. A grief-stricken priest pops round to have a look at Reagan for himself but isn't immediately convinced even though her face is unnaturally contorted and her eyes have changed to an inhuman color. Good detective work there!<br /><br />My main problem with The Exorcist is that it keeps cutting away to side-stories which deflates whatever tension Reagan's suffering generates. It almost ends up being a movie of subplots with no main narrative.<br /><br />I appreciate it from a film-making perspective in regards to the sound design and editing, and the fact that obnoxious amounts of CGI and intrusive music are not needed to create dread and mystery. But the story leaves too many open ends and just didn't satisfy me.<br /><br />It's hard to scare movie audiences these days. The only trick any filmmaker has left is to make them believe it's real. But The Exorcist fails on this. 1973 audiences were clearly just a little bit more naive and innocent.
0887306667|3.0|The authors start with the view that flawed marketing programs are the bane of big companies in America. Billions of dollars go down the drains but the mistakes in these programs cost the companies their valuable business. All the blunders occur because of the fact that immutable laws of marketing are never considered by the so called gurus. `There are laws of nature, so why shouldn't there be laws of marketing?' ask the authors, who have distilled their findings into basic laws that govern success or failure in market place.<br /><br />The law of leadership starts with the premise that it is better to be first than it is to be better. People remember the first man to conquer Everest not who followed thereafter. People remember the first product as superior. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products. The law of category urges the entrepreneur to set up a new category, if he cannot be first in a category. Similar to the first law, the law of the mind states that it is better to be first in the mind than to be first in the market place. The authors go on adding one catchy law after another, which on the face sound very convincing.<br /><br />Thus we have laws of perception, exclusivity, duality, opposite, perspective, candor, singularity, failure, hype and so on, till we reach the law of resources, which states that without adequate funding an idea won't get off the ground. Ideas without money are worthless. Money makes the marketing world go around.<br /><br />The authors close their advisory with a warning: the readers should not apply the laws of marketing within an existing organization. Many of the laws prick the corporate ego and conventional wisdom. If someone applies the immutable laws in an existing organization, he runs the risk of being bad-mouthed, ignored and even ostracized. Hence please take care.<br /><br />The authors leave you with an assurance that these laws of marketing will eventually help you achieve success, and success is the best revenge of all.<br />The book convinces the reader that marketing is a game of the mind, and winning or losing depends on the player's  psychological strength.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of 'Hits and Misses'nvinces the reader that marketing is a game of the mind, and winning or losing depends on the player's  psychological strength.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|As an animal lover, I was familiar with Temple Grandin's books.

Never let anything stand in the way of what you want to do.
0316069485|4.0|As an avid Connelly reader/fan, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of The Reversal. I typically start reading new Connelly novels when I know that I will have the time to read it over the course of a day or two because I don't like stopping once I've started  (a testament to Connelly's skill at suspense and character development, no doubt). The Reversal seemed to move much more quickly than Connelly's other novels, perhaps because it was less \\"gritty\\" and suspenseful than others.    Without revealing too much, I will say that while I enjoyed the Bosch/Haller duo, it seemed a bit forced and Bosch playing second fiddle on the case also resulted in him playing second fiddle in the book. Any Harry Bosch fan would probably be disappointed in the fact that Haller seemed to outshine Bosch in this pairing and I'm no exception. I did enjoy the book, of course. Unlike some other reviews, I thought the end was perfect (though very abrupt) and I enjoy the interplay between Harry and his daughter. There were little things, though, that seemed \\"off\\" to me. For one, Harry's sudden inability to form coherent sentences (instead of saying 'are you done with that?' he says 'are you done that?' and this is intentional as it's a specific focus of the interactions between Harry and his daughter, Maddie) didn't make any sense to me. Also, I thought Harry was just not present enough in this book to make it a true Bosch novel. It was so focused on the courtroom that we didn't see Harry doing what he does best. I also noticed that there was a lack of any sort of 'romantic encounter' for Harry, something atypical; though not necessary, this omission added to the \\"off\\" feel.    The Reversal is not going to be one of my favorite Connelly novels, but it is still a Connelly novel: interesting, surprising, character-focused, and detailed. It just fell a little bit short of my extremely high expectations. The ending was somewhat refreshing in a way (explaining how will completely give it away), but as a Bosch novel, it was a bit too lacking in the suspense department.     That said, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Haller at work and thought the novel, on the whole, was still an enjoyable read from Connelly (as always).
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I played the game once ages ago, I barely remember it, but the name did ring a bell. In anycase the film itself is pretty good, not scary, more like suspense thriller. The only issue I have is why noone can see \\"mother\\". When she and the police officer are there it is the creepy hell that the movie is about, but when the Father and the other officer are there it's just a regular abandoned town.<br /><br />Towards the end the mother is at home and she can't see her husband (well she acts as if she can see him, but we don't) and he can't see her. Im just confused as to why they can't see each other. Other than that the movie is actually good.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Those Penguin morons must never have heard of the supply and demand curve, as they've lost far more money in this price gouging scheme than they could have hoped to gain. All the one star reviews are a sale lost, and future sales of Penguin books judging by the outrage and negative PR.   Please don't blame Amazon and Kindle as it's the publisher that sets the price. BN Nook is in the same predicament. Penguin is in collusion with Steve Jobs and his Ipad to destroy the ebook market. Fortunately Congress is looking into these \\"Agency Model\\" price fixing shenanigans in legislation H.R. 3190 \\"Discount Pricing Consumer Protection Act\\". This is a shameful blot on the history of the publishing industry (along with blocking text to speech) when you consider ebooks save recourses and minimize environmental damage. Boycott Penguin and Apple and write/email your local Congressman to pass bill H.R. 3190. Hopefully Follet will wise up to how he's been used in this scam and will find another publisher for future books. The hardcover btw is currently $18 compared to the $19.99 ebook cost. Disgusting and inexcusable. Oh yeah, as to content, it's not as good as his previous works. Not just my opinion but also that of the NYTimes book review and other literary reviews. Google them to see for yourself, and download a free sample to judge for yourself. If you still want to read it get a decent barely used almost new copy plus shipping for under ten dollars off Amazon used books so neither the greedy publisher nor author can get royalties, and save some trees in the process. Then lend it to your friends as a \\"kiss my kindle in the ebook\\" message to those greedy creeps. Support your local library! Oh yeah, and check out how many of those 5-star reviewers actually have other reviews or if they're just publishing agency shills trying to mitigate all the furious blowback.

0817439390|5.0|I just upgraded from my simple point and shoot to a Nikon D90 determined to learn to REALLY use a camera.  Despite my best efforts, it didn't take long for me to realize that I needed help.  Aperture, ISO, shutter speed...all confusing...how could I possibly choose the right settings?  I am so excited about this book that I haven't finished reading it yet and I'm writing my review already.  Within the first hour it had me shooting in manual mode not only with confidence, but with perfect exposure!  I took a stunning picture yesterday that people are already asking for copies of.  The author uses terms that an amateur can understand, and gives you the opportunity to do simple exercises using different camera settings then explaining the outcome.  The things that I could not wrap my head around no matter how hard I tried are suddenly clear to me.  If you're struggling with understanding your camera and getting correct exposure, buy the book. You won't be disappointed.

B003GEDLW6|5.0|Though I must admit it took more than one listen to believe that, this second effort by Pendulum is, in my opinion, as good as, if not better than, their first release.  I absolutely love their blending of techno with rock.  There are more songs on here with vocals than their first but it doesn't detract from the music.  I do wish, however, that they would stick with the instrumentals and lighten up on the lyrics but that is just a matter of personal taste.  Bottom line is that this newest release is great to listen to and if it doesn't get your blood racing and you bopping in your chair, nothing will.

1593272200|5.0|I received a copy of this from the publisher, and boy am I glad I did.  It's a wonderful book that's an absolute keeper.<br /><br />I've done quite a bit of systems level programming with POSIX systems and Linux and I wish that I'd had this book earlier primarily because its descriptions of systems-level programming on Linux are incredibly clear and detailed.  Critically, the book is well written and never boring.  I found it a pleasure to dip into different sections where I did know the subject (e.g. TCP and sockets) and where I did not (e.g. memory mapped files).<br /><br />I then passed the book around in my office and a couple of days later got feedback from people that it had been very useful and that people thought it was well worth getting an office copy.<br /><br />I was worried when the back cover claimed that the book was a 'new classic', but I think it's likely to be justified.  It's nicely written and fun to read, and covers topics in depth.  The most important thing is that the author has achieved the right balance in his descriptions and is able to explain clearly a huge variety of topics.
B001CDWFPC|2.0|This review specifically covers the Kindle edition of the ESV Bible.  In short, there's good reason why the Kindle version is only a quarter of the price of the hardcover edition.      In the print edition, notes are at the bottom of the page and cross-references are in the margin.  Sprinkled throughout are drawings and other supplements, and maps are at the back of the book.  There are also lengthy chapters on translation techniques, languages, etc.    With the Kindle version, there are no cross-references... period.  The passage notes are there, but you have to access a completely different screen to get to them.  This is more than just clunky: it defeats the flow of reading a passage, glancing at a given note, and then returning to reading the passage.  With the Kindle version, you can read the passage or you can read the notes - take your pick.      The wonderful maps in the print edition are technically available in the Kindle, but they're virtually unreadable even after zooming in as much as possible.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a bit of a pain locating a specific verse.  I've found it easiest to use the \\"go to\\" feature to pick the table of contents, then select the book, then the chapter, then page forward to the specific verse you want.  It's a bunch of steps and a bit slow, but not awful once you get used to it.  I've found the search feature to be pretty lame - you get page after page of hits on your search, but it's very difficult to tell where the hit is located.  You can't narrow the search to one book, so you get hits throughout the entire Bible and the notes section as well with pretty limited ability to tell which is which.      One positive note: I've read other posts about the Kindle version taking hours to download.  Mine downloaded in about 10 minutes with no trouble at all.      Would I buy it again?  Well... probably.  The price is no higher than several other Bible translations available on the Kindle that don't include the notes or maps or other learning aids.  But don't make the mistake that you're getting all the features of the hardcover for a Kindle-version price - you're definitely not.
B003YK42LQ|3.0|I guess I'm just missing the fun of Aha Shake Heartbreak and the gritty genius of Because of the Night.   I understand KOL's change of direction with Only by the Night, even though it was my least favorite of their albums. There is no denying that it served its purpose: they picked up tons of fans. And heck, there were some really great songs on there too. I remember the first time I heard Use Somebody (before it got played to death). I really liked it and knew it was going to be a huge hit. I didn't quite realize how huge, though ;) But with Come Around Sundown, I think KOL was trying to replicate the sound of ObtN.  But they just missed the mark a bit. I've listened to it through about 10 times now, and there are some good songs here, but no truly great ones.  None that make the hair on the back of my neck stand up the first time I hear it like Knocked Up. And the biggest problem is that there are some really boring songs on here too. I can't really say that about their previous albums.  I'm still a fan, and I'll listen to this cd quite a bit, I'm sure. And I'll keep my fingers crossed that they'll surprise me with their next album.

B003HC8I5M|5.0|I am an avid Phil Collins fan. I have and cherish all his solo albums, and some from Genesis too! I have always looked forward to his new release and was upset to read that he had got injurred and couldn't play the drums anymore. So when I heard he was releasing a new album, I simply couldn't wait to get it. Now this is a classic Motown sound, unlike all his previous solo albums! Even the cd song list is labelled Side A and Side B, reminiscent of the audio cassette, and most of the songs are typically very short, unlike PC's prolonged instrumental interludes. If you liked the Motown sound, you'll love this album. For me it is just a change from the Phil Collins I know and love, and I missed the drums. Nevertheless, it is a great album and I am already getting used to it!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read this book in two days because I had to see how they turned out. It was at times a very disturbing book because it could be in the non-fiction section. The author was brilliant in having the story be told by a five year old boy. I never grew tired of his innocence. I  was able to see things through his mind and feel what he felt. Just amazing. I highly recommend this book, my only question is was this written before the Duggard case?

B001AQO3WY|2.0|This was tough to watch emotionally. I was a marine during this time. It got me very anxious and I wonder what people who were not in the military feel about this series. It isn't pretty and I am disapointed in the marines who sold out to give information on this matter. The problem most don't know is this stuff is real and is so unfortunate. I don't recommend watching it. Marines fight so people who arn't Marines don't have to be subject to these situations. I understand HBO is trying to push the envelope...but I don't think this nation was ready yet. Things are pretty hard right now. I recommend uplifting films. This nation is horror and blood crazy right now. It is sad when the majority of films and television are horror and sexually explicit. What is that saying about who we have become?

I did that, with USPS delivery confirmation. He then avoided me for OVER A MONTH and NEVER REFUNDED ME! So I was out the items, shipping, and return shipping out of my pocket! Thankfully Amazon reimbursed me for the purchase price plus shipping but BEWARE! This was my worst experience on Amazon, Ebay, you name it.
0817439390|5.0|If you've recently invested in a dSLR and you've been shooting with a high-end point-n-shoot camera in the past, this book is for you! For new photographers who are learning to shoot like pro, understanding exposure is really important.<br /><br />Before I started reading this book, I had read a few others so I had some understanding of how aperture, shutter speed and ISO control the exposure in a photograph. But these concepts are far clearer to me now after reading Bryan Peterson's 3rd Edition of Understanding Exposure.<br /><br />You also get access to online video streams in which the author is showing his exposure tricks. I really learned quite a lot from this book as well as from online video streams that come with the book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those familiar with this show, you are getting exactly what the title says. The only thing that would make it more complete would be if the Firefly movie had been included.<br />For those of you who are not familiar with this show, it was a short lived sci-fi that mixed concepts of old world customs and lifestyles with the joys of pirating and surfing the universe. This show is a wonderful mix of the \\"western\\" cowboy lifestyle, complete with revolvers, that takes place aboard a ship named (you guessed it...) Firefly.

B0042O85ES|2.0|The Stones seem to play every song too fast on this tape. They were in much better form on the later shows of this tour (see the Live in New York bootleg), and in much MUCH better form on the famous 1973 King Biscuit broadcast of the Bruxelles and Wembley (London) shows that were lamentably not caught on film. Recently Jagger has admitted to have wanted to release the 1973 live stuff, and that they still are thinking about it.    The highlight for me on this DVD is Mick Taylor's playing on Love in Vain. Mick is always spot-on, and when he left, they lost that great grinding guitar thing between him and Keith, the sound that for a large part defines The Stones and that they never really recovered with Woody.    Oh what a pity: there's so much live audio material from this period (the Stones performed a lot in 72 and 73) that shows a band playing so much better than on this Ladies and Gentlemen release...    So guys, if you like this Ladies and Gentlemen performance, you owe it to yourself to search out the bootlegs from this era!    *****    Revised, after a friend gave me the DVD: the video and audio quality is a little better than my bootleg. Still, the King Biscuit recorded shows of Wembley and Brussels are so FAR SUPERIOR, it's not even funny.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I have never rated or reviewed anything; I leave that to others. But, this CD is too good to not contribute what little I can.  I'm a little old lady, firmly fixed in classical and old folk music.  I plunked this CD in my car stereo, and promptly got goose bumps, it is so good!  The vocal and instrumental harmonies are flawless, and frankly, just beautiful.  The ringing banjo is an addition you rarely hear on music in this country, and what an addition it is!  I'd recommend this album to anyone I know. It's good enough to cross all lines.  Take it from me, I've been around a long time!    Sue May
0439023513|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK !!!!!! I had great expectations as it was the final book in the series. I loved them all but, I think that this last book was the best of the whole seies! I was soo sad when Prim died toward the end. But to me, there were too many things that happened in the book toward the end that didn't really fit u know? (but you'll have to read the book to find out!) Hope you love it as much as I did and I hope that suzanne Collins comes out with more books in the future!
B001CZJKS0|3.0|was very excited to find this on here my hubby is a huge horror fan but was disappointed when we recieved it because the description of the item was not clear on which movies you would recieve with this box set, we expected to have 1-5 and got 1 4 5  and 3 other dvd's which are basically another copy of the first but on bluray, 25 years of horror and  a narrative version of the first movie, would recommend a better description of this product so people know what they are paying for since it does cost 50 dollars and in these time money is tight
0765350386|5.0|I picked up this book as a way to introduce myself to Brandon Sanderson. Mainly due to the fact that he had taken over for Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" (WOT) series. I personally had to abandon the WOT after book six, due to the fact that the plot seemed to stall radically and seemed to turn into a soap opera (only my opinion). Due to the its huge popularity I was curious to see what they would do to conclude such an epic work with a new author. Since I didn't want to read the six books I couldn't get through, I decided to read Mistborn, as it seems to be Mr. Sanderson's most popular work.    I have to say I wasn't dissapointed. It was a great read and I'm someone who reads a ton of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Enough that when I find a new author I can enjoy it brings me tremendous joy, knowing that there is a lot more to dive into. I would recommend this story to fantasy lovers because it gives us a glimps into a fresh new world of magic that is both practical and mysterious. I will definitely devour the other two books in this trilogy. If this is the guy finishing up the WOT series, then maybe it'll be worth revisiting at a later date.
0790742780|4.0|I like this film because I think the writer is trying to give one message to you: don't hide and build up your disappointments until they make you crack and get violent.     The story shows a man who \\"followed all of the rules\\" that people gave him, and he  didn't think that his straight-laced society would let him down, or that his straight-laced behavior would let him down. But he didn't see that societies can change, and that if you don't keep learning new job skills, you can get fired.  You can become obsolete at your job if you don't learn new jobs skills.You also can lose your mind by not learning to adapt to a changing society.     The hero doesn't learn to handle his anger about people in a good way, and he doesn't learn to handle his anger about his job, or his other angers, in constructive ways.     He probably needed to keep evolving his job skills to keep his job irreplaceable. And he probably needed to learn a way to correctly vent his angers in good ways, like joining a rock band + yelling out his anger, or getting into a story writing club + writing out his overwhelming anger.     Instead, held in his angers too long...until he cracked...and then he took his anger out on innocent people, with his pistols and shotgun.     The hero needed to learn not to do what the heroes in his fictional war films do, you can't say to yourself: I get pushed around too much, so I must overreact and lash out in anger and violence.     The hero, and societies like him, need to learn how to cope with every day angers, or even bigger angers, and not use violence as the last ditch way to release unhappiness and anger.

B00006ADD5|5.0|I went eagerly to see the director's cut when the film was re-released in the early 1990s at the Edinburgh film festival. I was disappointed. I much preferred the tighter producer's cut, which I first saw in a massive, traditional one-screen cinema, in 1964. My `five star' rating therefore goes to the original released version. I was sixteen when I first saw the film. It struck me on four counts. Visually, it was (and remains) stunning, in whatever version is seen. Secondly, the music seemed so perfect (I still have the LP!). Thirdly, it was about a man who had to rely on his own inner strength and charm to achieve what he appeared to be destined for, though he refuted his own destiny (complaining that &#34;nothing is written&#34; - in the stars as it were). Finally, was the relationship between Lawrence and Sherif Ali; delicately portrayed. That was a different kind of love. It inspired me, as an impressionable teenager, to become self-reliant in all that was possible to be so. As life moved on, charm entered the equation. As for love; that's a different matter entirely.  P.S. 10th June, 2017. Netflix has a 'completely restored version' available. I've just watched it again. It remains visually stunning and there's not a wasted word in the beautifully constructed script.  Ian Hunter.

B003VIW8DK|2.0|What a waste!<br /><br />All the instruments are at the same volume as are Ferry's vocals. a bad production job I think, given the glorious work on Frantic.<br />Two stars for the cover!<br /><br />re-review November 10. Well it's been two weeks and I must admit I was a bit harsh in my original summation.<br />The one thing that this album has going for it, is that it is a \\"whole album listen\\". I can happily sit through the whole set and never feel the need to skip tracks. I feel I must have gotten used to the production as it does not annoy me anymore...which is not to say i don't think the production is lousy. It is!
0812550706|5.0|I found this book to be spectacular, and will continue to read Mr. Card's work since he does what the best Sci-Fi authors do. He stretches the imagination and the value structure that most of us take for granted. It's one thing to craft a good story, but it's quite another to make the reader think and question themselves for feeling a certain way. I have seen that some people feel that this book is written too plain, but I didn't for a minute feel that way as I torpedoed myself toward the exciting climax (which I would never dare spoil for anyone). Any great work polarizes, and I think this qualifies.

0812550757|5.0|This book was a great continuation of the story of Ender. What was even more surprising was that it was a completely different type of story. One that also uses the characters to give us both sides of an ethical coin that Card flips back and forth with precision. I can see why this book was as critically successful as \\"Ender's Game\\", since he didn't do anything like a traditional sequel. I suppose that's what is so remarkable about it. The only drawback I can see is that he begins the book with a bunch of notes on pronounciation, which nearly caused me to put the story down. Just ignore them (unless your a linguist) and get to the story.
0393338959|5.0|Even if one disagrees with Stiglitz's ideological biases, this exposition of recent economic events is excellent, both accurate and fair in its criticisms. Stiglitz also provides a good discussion of the trade imbalances that afflict the world economy, as globalization is his specialty. Best is the challenges he presents to his fellow economists. But it's not without its blemishes. Since I have given the book five stars I will skip over the kudos and address its weaknesses.<br /><br />Stiglitz sets up a weak strawman in market \\"fundamentalism,\\" as most serious free market advocates eschew dogma and see a limited role for government, especially to insure open and competitive markets. Stiglitz himself admits the dominant role of markets and only argues for a subjective \\"balance\\" between govt regulation and markets. This continuum can be freely debated, as many of the recent market failures stemmed from circumventing free market principles. Most of the violations Stiglitz cites boil down to inside actors using political or economic power to secure \\"heads we win, tails you lose\\" outcomes. This is what happened across the banking system as we privatized the returns and socialized the risks with bailouts. A functioning market economy relies on trust and must prevent blatant violations of the rules of voluntary exchange. Thus the crisis was not a repudiation of free markets, it was both a failure of risk management and a warning regarding the abuse of market principles.<br /><br />The policy debate over govt regulation too often slips into the idea of the regulatory bureaucrat rather than the dynamics of self-regulation based upon competing interests. Our political democracy relies on competing interests and a governing structure for checks and balances, with minimal monitoring. Our market structures should strive to do the same with competitors policing each other. Stiglitz mostly steers clear of this distinction while conceding that much of the blame for the financial crisis was the agency problem that befell not only the private sector, but also the public sector. Regulatory \\"capture\\" is a serious concern for regulating the financial sector.<br /><br />Stiglitz correctly castigates the Bush and Obama administrations for laxness and ineptness in managing the crisis, but whitewashes the Clinton years, when much of the financial deregulation was enacted. The Clinton regime was instrumental to the Democratic courtship of Wall Street and Stiglitz himself was a prominent Clinton economic advisor. Obama has picked up where Clinton left off, reappointing many from his team. (Hope and change turned out to be more of the same.) For its part, Wall Street is an equal opportunity player in Washington.<br /><br />The most controversial issue is probably Stiglitz's unwavering support of Keynesian demand stimulus. There is reason to suspect this cure-all for a deflating economy, but Stiglitz dismisses all doubts. However, the effectiveness of demand stimulus depends on the Keynesian multiplier, which in turn depends on a healthy banking system extending credit in response to credit demand from the private sector. In the aftermath of a debt deflation, both of these conditions fail in robustness. With a balance sheet recession, it may well be that the Keynesian multiplier is closer to zero than the hoped for 1.5. Another way to look at this is that Keynesian policies may be appropriate AFTER a collapse in prices due to massive deleveraging but much less effective in PREVENTING that collapse. The Japanese experience suggests that propping up a zombie banking system can dangerously prolong the post-bust correction. In this context the Fed's policy of reflation is likely to yield more crippling asset bubbles.<br /><br />The most productive discussion is when Stiglitz turns on his fellow economists. His criticism of the dominant neoclassical paradigm is spot on, especially when it comes to macroeconomic theory. Our current macropolicies are so confusedbecause our theoretical tools are less useful in a nonlinear world and this is especially true in the world of finance. Rational actor assumptions have limited value in a real world where people are loss averse, heterogeneous and adaptable in their preferences, and show a tendency to herd behavior. Our most intractable policy problems are those of skewed or maldistributions, whether they be income and wealth inequality, global warming, health care, hunger or energy. Mathematical models based on fixed preferences, simultaneous equations, and equilibrium conditions are not amenable to distributional dynamics. Thus, the solution to inequality always regresses back to initial conditions, like education or material endowments. Instead, our policies should be addressing the access and distribution of financial capital and the dynamics of our financial markets. The rich are getting richer off their leveraged capital and political influence, not their good looks or brains.<br /><br />Given that managing uncertainty may be the best we can do in public policy, Stiglitz correctly argues for the dominant role of risk management. But he also fails to consider how risk and uncertainty is most effectively managed through decentralization and diversification. This is accomplished through wide and deep markets. Social insurance pooling may be an important corollary to private risk management where private markets are incomplete, but is far less efficient and prone to unmanageable moral hazard costs. Think how many would choose to cash in their 401(k) or private pension for Social Security promises, or their private health insurance for Medicare? The bottom line is that health care and retirement funding are private goods and forcing them into the public goods model only hampers their production and distribution. We may need a safety net, but that's as much as the empirical data supports. Entitlement reform will require private substitutes and this makes it critical we insure that markets function as intended.  This may be the best argument for financial market reform.<br /><br />I suppose one could write a book instead of a review, but Stiglitz has already written one that offers the reader much food for thought. I suggest not taking anything for granted, as Stiglitz has his own ideological agenda to hoe. But he does a very commendable job in debunking much of the partisan-motivated bloviating.ss useful in a nonlinear world and this is especially true in the world of finance.

Awesome!!!!
B0034G4OVS|2.0|Thriller and horror films never accurately portrayed smart people doing the intelligent thing in any given situation and, despite all the hype and hoopla, the film Frozen doesn't really bring anything new to the table.<br /><br />The premise of the film is simple, predictable, and unrelenting in its ability to have the characters do the absolute worst things possible in a survival situation beyond sneaking up a ski lift right at closing time.  Idiots.  Just to make sure I wasn't being to harsh on the film I brought along an expert witness, a former USAF Pararescue Jumper with an emphasis in arctic survival, to rate the realism of the film or, in this instance, the severe lack thereof.<br /><br />He found error after error and not just the plain stupidity of the characters but in the lack of realism of the survivability of humans against a winter setting with natural wildlife.  Errors included how much quicker frostbite would have settled in to how Frozen depicted a grossly uncharacteristic portrayal of wild wolves and coyotes.<br /><br />Regardless of the poor quality of the film itself I feel as though I should throw it some charity and comment on the decent acting jobs of the rather obscure casting crew that got stuck doing this high school film.  I may never had heard of them, but at least they didn't bog the script down any more than it did already.<br /><br />All in all, Frozen is as much a wasteland as the setting it takes place in.  Solid rental.
B003INBOEM|4.0|let's face it;  we are at an age where martial arts films are either ridiculous or banal.  HK and china are killing the genre with mediocre efforts that copy each other.  how many other Ip Man movies are now out?    Ip Man suffers from many of the same cliches as all the other recent martial arts films coming out of China.  from the Chinese nationalism (and anti-Japanese fervor) to the same wirefu moves we've seen in countless other movies.  how many times do we need to see two men dueling on a platform and one nearly falls at the edge only to somehow wirefu back to safety?  it's in here... hm, sounds a lot like Fearless with Jet Li.    of course, the Ip Man biography is... surprise, totally fabricated.  i guess that's ok because anyone who still thinks \\"based on a true story\\" is somehow true probably still believes in bigfoot and the tooth fairy.    having said all that, this movie is still quite good.  forget the Ip Man baggage, the political overtones, the cliche story and you get a very nice performance by Donnie Yen as the stoic and reluctant master.  that's right, Donnie Yen's acting is alone worth the watch.  his acting is both nuanced from his care of his wife and expressive when his inner fury boils over watching his friend get shot.  (and let me also add that Lam Ka-tung performed admirably as the Police chief turned traitor.  his side story added a nice dimension to an otherwise typical one.)    the martial arts choreography is restrained in the use of wirefu and yet, i wish it was even more so.  there is a gritty brutality to Ip Man when his anger and determination is fully realized.  and it was distracting to see some of the comical hanging in the air moves.  at least they didn't fight on poles for no apparent reason.    this may sound like a negative review, but only because this movie was good enough for me to care and want it to have been better. there are enough, \\"wow, that was very cool!\\" moments in the movie that make it a worthwhile purchase andi give it a very solid 4 stars.

0525423842|4.0|1st 60 Pages - Yawnnnnnnnn, nuff said?    ***May contain Spoilers!!!***  Rest of the book was where it got good.  I think a lot of the reviews on here people completely missed the point of this book.  It was not to determine whether that Peter Duffy who was on trial murdered his wife no.  It was about a kid named Theo Boone helping a friend's cousin who was an illegal immigrant who witnessed a guy leave a murder scene to be able to testify or the defendant would walk free on a flimsy case.  Theo had to figure out with the help of his uncle and parents figure out a way for him to testify without going to jail and convince the Judge to file a mistrial.  Throughtout the whole book Grisham kept throwing things at Theo such as drunk driving cases, custody cases, animal court etc.  This book was about THEO BOONE BEING A KID LAWYER, not the murder case, thats merely in there to give Theo something big to work on and make an interesting book.

B002JVWR4U|5.0|Season Two of Dollhouse allows for a lot of amazing character development and interaction. Eliza Dushku's performances of Echo's many facets are amazing, complicated and well-acted. The rest of the cast is top notch and versatile as well.    Dollhouse was a developed and mature show from its first episode in Season One, and thankfully the powers that be allowed these additional 13 episodes to be produced beyond the first season's run of 13, allowing Whedon to complete (if short) an incredible and satisfying story arch.     A number of facets concerning humanity's near possible (and plausible) future are explored, including the rise of technology that allows humans to be enslaved/controlled and corporate greed (themes that are currently being explored in Ron Moore's Caprica). Dollhouse gets dark at times, but always has twists and turns throughout that keeps the watcher engaged and guessing. Truly top notch television - a rarity in this age of emphasizing mediocrity in the media. Includes a Dollhouse comic book and some nice bonus features with Whedon and the cast discussing their experiences.

If they want to make some movie about some psychos make a movie about these politicians In Oklahoma that made It where You must get fingerprinted to get a drivers license, Its kinda like taking the mark of the beast and their motto Is, driving Is Not a right Its a privilege! I bought this movie on VHS Instead of Bluray and Everyone knows Analog Sounds better than digital and the Music Is the best thing about this movie.
031603438X|4.0|Life has been a great ride for Keith, and the book is a great read for fans; as it turns out, for the Rolling Stones time really is on their side after all. The book is filled with stories that somehow amaze with how different the world seemed back then. Now when the only parental outrage Katy Perry can generate is her outfit on Sesame Street, tales of the Stones in America seem positively other-worldly. The Stones' music, and Keith's wicked guitar riffing, is still there to incite or amuse us all in turn.<br /><br />Well, they are all gentlemen now, and grandfathers these days, but Keith is attempting to go old gracefully without the albatross of a young man's \\"hope I die before I get old\\" lyric in the book. (As far back as 1978 Keith contemplated the wisdom in the words \\"I'm going to walk before they make me run.\\") The guitar-slinger seems content to retire or refute most of he bad-boy stories, told with great relish one more time at least for this (book) tour.<br /><br />Will Mick and Keith play on stage again? Sure, as long as there is a five-pound note in The Bank of England's vaults. Keith-the-estate-gardener rock star who played the Pirate King to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow must maintain some wickedness, certainly, if even for press junkets: it seems he did actually snort some of the old man's cremated ashes that had fallen out on the coffee-table.  Then again, Keith has given up drinking now, at the age of 66, and a man must surely be allowed at least one vice. Cheers ...!
B003L77GG0|5.0|This series is the best series if you want to see how superman grew up and how the Justice League of America came about.  This series keeps all the movies, the comics and the series with George Reeves, in check.  The only complaint that I have with the series is that they bought Lois Lane in the series too soon.  Remember, Clark only got to know Lois when he left Smallville and went to Metropolis to work for the Daily Planet.  Other than that, that is the only complaint/negative complaint that I have with the show.  So sit back and enjoy the show and even this is the last season for the show, hopefully it will the best season ever and leave an opening for The New Adventures of Superman!!!  Who knows!  Enjoy the show.  Best of lick to this winning series.

B003YOZNBU|1.0|Jonah Hex Movie Review  Jonah Hex; gunslinger, bounty hunter and outlaw. The DC Comic Book classic recently turned motion picture; chronicles the life of Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin). Directed by Jimmy Hayward, (Horton Hears a Who), Jonah Hex details one man's life after his run in with psycho General Quentin Turnbull, (John Malkovich). Quentin blames Jonah Hex for the death of his son, and in-turn enacts revenge on him by brutally slaying Jonah's wife and son. Jonah immediately swears revenge and dedicates his life to dishing out justice as he sees fit. Good or bad, Jonah is forced by the government to help fight General Quentin, who has stolen secret government weapons. The movie which is only 83 minutes long, (including credits) failed to deliver a storyline that will keep fans of this supernatural western comic book hooked for years. Not only because the original Jonah character has been filed down and drastically changed; but this movie is short, confusing, and very hard to follow. I was very disappointed in this comic book adaptation; it would have been nice to see Jonah Hex follow in the footsteps of other DC Comic book greats such as, Superman, Batman and Wonder woman.
0374158460|5.0|I had a hard time getting hooked on the book and even put it down for a few days. But I am so happy I picked it back up and gave it another try. I took me 1/3 of the way through to get fully engrossed in the characters but I thought the book was fantastic. I couldn't put it down the last 3 days until I finished. Franzen has a unique writing style that I like. I haven't read The Corrections but I now plan on it.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is just another worker on the dark side of the moon. He's there to man the lunar base, and to make sure the mining machines function properly. Sam is alone, except for the base robot / computer, Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey). All is well until an accident occurs during a routine check, plunging everything into chaos. MOON is a superior science fiction effort w/ a memorable central (almost sole) character. Sam's isolation and loneliness are palpable. He is supposed to be nearing the end of his 3-year mission. Of course, that would be too simple! If I had to compare MOON to any other film, I would say that SILENT RUNNING would be it's closest relative. Both films deal w/ solitary figures in bleak situations. In space! Highly recommended...

B003L77TZI|4.0|i love katy perry better than lady gaga and kesha. i reviewed on youtube her live performances and was alittle disappointed. the latest cd by perry has 4 or 5 great songs with catchy lyrics. the other 7 songs on her cd sound like filler material. teenage dream, last friday night, california gurls, and peacock are excellent songs but the rest kinda went downhill.  i do like the cd but its not a katy perry classic like her debut cd.... hopefully this will change. also love the cd cover.......

0743297334|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a book that everyone should read. In it, Hemingway focuses on the concept of love but in a very unique way. Hemingway uses his characters to portray love as a scary thing. He strongly supports his notions regarding love throughout the book.         The book takes place in Paris and Spain. A group of friends travel to a small Spanish town for a fishing trip and to participate in the annual grand fiesta. The group consists of four men and one women. The women, named Brett, had some interesting ideas towards relationships. She creates conflict between the men and even between some newly found Spanish friends. It appears Brett creates conflict to avoid getting close to people. The drinking is endless, creating even more conflict between friends. Many relationships are ruined in a period of only a few days.         The book is told from the first person perspective of a well off American writer named Jake, who lives and works in Paris. Hemingway uses Jake to tell the story of how some people lived during the early 1900's. I think Hemingway wrote this book to give a good, entertaining look into the lives of Europeans in the early 1900's. I also think something in his own life gave him the idea to write this book. He spent a portion of his life living in Paris; his experiences there could have contributed to the portrayal of events in The Sun Also Rises.         Hemingway's style of writing through the dialogue of his characters makes this book suitable for all teens and adults. Hemingway never overstates conversation. There is a purpose in every word he writes, and it sounds like you could actually be talking to the character. Hemingway's idea of love was intriguing in that he describes it as complicated and unforgiving. In the future, this Hemingway presentation of love could change my opinions of other characters in other books.         I would highly recommend this book to others for several reasons. First, I think everyoneneeds to read Hemingway to experience his unique writing style. It is brilliantly simple. Second, the ideas presented regarding love are intriguing. For example, Hemingway focuses on fear of love and suggests people don't always end up with their true love. Hemingway's portrayal of people's fear of relationships may help explain some reasons for divorce. For example, fi people tend to avoid the most meaningful relationships, the \\"lesser\\" relationships may be more likely to end in failure. Third, this book remains contemporary. Everyone who reads this book can find a connection to themselves or a family member. Indeed, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises focuses on the many layered connections of his characters--I think those connections made this book easier and more fun to read.-By Hannah Hunsaker
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is an absolutely incredible band. They deliver strong, deep lyrics and all around amazing music. To see this epic band live in concert is beyond words, it should be on everyone's bucket list. These guys take their performance very seriously and provide an intense show. I would suggest this album as one of Tool's greatest legacy along with their album 10,000 days. In fact, each of Tool's albums are amazing and should be added to any music lover's collection

0312370849|3.0|I have always loved learning about the Holocaust. When my mom told me about a Holocaust drama, I had to read it. Sarah's Key by Tatiana De Rosnay is the perfect World War II drama with an amazing twist. Along with that, the book has an amazing twist. It will keep you intrigues for days. There have been many books written about the Holocaust, but this one is like no other book. It is unique in its own way.       Sarah's Key is about a round up of Jewish men and women in the 1940's. It is fictional, but based on historic events. The story goes back and forth between a 10 year old girl living through the Holocaust and a modern day journalist living researching the round up in Paris, France. The author explains how people try to hide historic events because they are so horrific. The thesis of this story would be that just because you try to hide horrific events, it doesn't mean they disappear.       July 1942 was a hard time in the history of France. Thousands of Jewish families were round up and had to stay in the Velodrome d'Hiver. They were then sent off to transit camps in France such as Drancy, before being packed off to Auschwitz, a nazi death camp. What is so frightening about this whole incident is that the rounding up and recruitment of Jews for deportation was done by the French authorities.       The story goes back and forth between the point of view of 10 year old Sarah and modern day journalist Julia. The genre of this book is historical fiction, and it is aimed at either young adult readers. The parts of World War II you kind of have to understand and enjoy this book. The book kind of uncovers the horrific things Paris had to go through during the roundup.       Overall I thin the book was very well written. Once you get used to the alternating roles you really understand the story a lot better. The book was definitely not like any other book. It didn't really seem too cliche to me. There are a lot of books out there that have been written about WWIIand this one has its own twist. This is the first book that I read that switch characters in it. Also most of the Holocaust books have been written about Germany or Denmark. This one was about Paris. For the audience it is going for, it gets the job done. My favorite part of the book is how everything is tied together between the two roles it switches between. It just adds a nice touch to this really good story.
B000021YQV|5.0|Truly the best album from this amazing band. In fact, Toxicity is among my top 5 favorites because I am able to listen to the entire cd without skipping a song. If the question was whether or not to purchase this cd, I would definitely suggest to buy this particular album.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|While I can't say I've been with Florence and the Machine from the very beginning, I am proud to say that I discovered this incredible artist several months before she started getting wider exposure in the US through TV commercials and movie promos.  It's so rare these days to find an artist with a truly unique sound, but that is exactly what you get from Florence and the Machine.  Florence Welch's voice is simply mesmerizing and beautiful, and I can only describe her music as ethereal and downright hypnotic - and the diversity of musical styles to be found wrapped around these 13 tracks is amazing.  Individual songs such as Dog Days Are Over feature amazing transitions within themselves, as Florence can go from a soft and poetic delivery to a howling crescendo of emotion and back at the drop of a hat.  She may borrow from many different musical influences, but her sound is entirely her own.  In terms of creativity, raw emotional depth, and meaningful lyrics, I would rank Florence way up there, not too far behind Tori Amos (and believe me when I say that this is high praise indeed).<br /><br />I wish I had the depth of musical knowledge needed to truly do this album justice.  I can't even begin to describe Florence's music - it's something you really have to experience on your own.  All I can say is that I've listened to this album numerous times over the last several months and have yet to begin to tire of it.  You can pick and choose individual tracks to listen to and never go wrong, but Lungs is really an album that should be listened to in its entirety - with the repeat button on to start the whole thing over again when it's finished.  This is a musical work of art that captures your full attention each and every time you hear it.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is an excellent piece of American literature that has very few happy parts, so if you like happy endings, this probably isn't the right book for you. As a reader, you're constantly comparing Collins' word with our own. For example, America is spoiled compared to the rest of the world. Suzanne Collins delivers the book's theme about hardships, and the fact that happiness is as rare as an invisibility cloak into a non-stop read that tears through the center of your thoughts. Collins chose the theme correctly when she wrote an invigorating novel about depression, hatred, and a few hints of nuclear and political unrest as seen through Panem.                               The plot of Mockingjay is confusing if you haven't read the previous books in the series. It's about a girl named Katniss Everdeen living in the miserable and dull District Thirteen after she manipulated her second Hunger Games and escaped to safety. Unfortunately for her, Peeta (her on and off boyfriend who also joined the Hunger Games twice with Katniss and fought against the Capitol (was taken prisoner by president Snow and is getting tortured to get to Katniss, this forces Katniss to become a complete wreck and have to go on medication that helps her deal with her insane thoughts. She and her friend Gale, a lifetime friend and hunting partner, try to cope with the hardships. Eventually, Katniss becomes the symbol for the rebellion of all the Districts. District Thirteen and Katniss decide to shoot propaganda videos so the district's morale is boosted to hopefully win the war. This continues for a while until Katniss gets separated from the main group so she decides to go to the Capitol. Once she gets to the Capitol she rescues Peeta and then they try to assassinate President Snow as Peeta suffers from an absoulutely terrible poison that ravages his mind. This is the main plot of the novel, Mockingjay.                    Katniss' first person narration of the story is phenomenal, it's almost as if Collins has experienced the fictional life of Katniss and is writing an autobiography. This definitely brings out Collins' extraordinary potential for writing, which delves deep into into the reader's mind and makes them think about one and only one thing, the book. For me, this book made me think about all of the loathing in the world, and that as long as there are people there is always going to be warfare no matter what. This science fiction novel may be labeled for teens and a young adult audience, but honestly I think you can be of any age to enjoy this series. One, day I even caught my mom reading this.                     I would definitely recommend this book to anyone in search of a great novel, but like every book, there are few flaws. One of these flaws is that it has too slow of a beginning. It's not until the end of part one before you discover very many important or action packed scenes. Another flaw is that Collins could have elaborated on the history of the wrecked country Panem,  how the capitol came to power?, where Panem would be located on a modern map?, what other secrets does the Capitol have?, and why did Collins' decide to make such a terrible ending. Despite these few flaws, Mockingjay is one of the best books I've ever read and if I were you I'd  place an order for it right now.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I'd heard a lot of hype about the big twist in Shutter Island. However, I never heard what it was. We finally rented the DVD and watched it last night.<br /><br />The movie is creepy enough to be a good semi-horror thriller. The island and sanitarium just reek of atmosphere. Scenes are played out in a meticulously creepy manner. However, about ten minutes into the movie we figured out what the twist was.<br />Maybe that type of thing has been done just too many times, I don't know.<br /><br />Aside from that, for an easy-to-figure-out plot twist, this was a well-done movie. I enjoyed the buildup even if the ending was what I expected. The only scene I didn't like, which unfortunately, was a big key to the plot, was the family scene, the real motivation behind this whole thing.<br /><br />I'll admit that I was left guessing as to who the real bad guys were until the end, just in case my assumption was wrong. I enjoyed not being sure.<br /><br />Great actors, creepy scenery, well-built story. I only give it four stars instead of five because of the lack of surprise at the ending and the disturbing family scene. I'm sure others have given plenty of spoilers with so many reviews already on here, but I'm not going to add to it. Recommended.
1601251505|5.0|I'll start like a lot of others and list the color of the box I started with, it was purple. I've played D&D, AD&D and 2nd Edition. I skipped out on 3.0 and 3.5 because I lost interest in the hobby. So having recently felt the urge to play, I turned to my favorite game and bought the 4ed core rulebooks. After reading through them, I noticed that they were lacking something from my Keep on the Borderland days, something I could not put my finger on. Then I heard about Pathfinder and picked up the Core Rulebook. I discovered what was missing from 4e after reading the intro to this hefty tome, the spirit of D&D. That spirit is alive and well in Pathfinder.I've since ran both games and played in the some weekly D&D Encounters sessions and I have to say the Pathfinder feels more like D&D to me. I want to remind you that I have never played 3.0 or 3.5, never even read a rulebook. I also want to point out that this is not a bashing of 4e, I like 4e, but when I want to play D&D I'll reach for Pathfinder.<br /><br />As for the product, it is gorgeous. This book, along with the Bestiary are all you need to run the game. It is well written and the artwork is outstanding. I especially enjoyed the artwork and story that preceded each chapter. The materials are high quality and the book is well made.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it would be that the pages are a little shiny and can be hard to read at certain angles due to the reflection.
0439023521|4.0|A group of twenty-four teenagers battle it out until death, the last one alive is the winner. This hideous, so called game, held yearly, is the Capitol's way of making sure they have total control over their twelve districts. Sound like a good book? Millions of teenagers and adults alike all over the nation seem to think so. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a spectacular action story for young adults, with themes about survival love, cleverly told in first person, which keeps you turning the pages until the last one. The book is fast, intense, and full of action.       While reading The Hunger Games, one is absorbed by the story. The main character Katniss Everdeen, is someone that you don't find endearing at the beginning of the book, but you find yourself rooting for her anyway. The descriptive and engaging writing style helps to create the complex and suspenseful plot.     Though some parts are vague and leave you in the dark, and even though the story is not totally realistic, most of the book is well explained and interesting,         One of the best parts of the book is that the idea is so original. The theme of survival has of course been used in various books. However, this particular book is like nothing you have read before because of things like the teen violence and heroism. The idea of writing in first person is also a good way to write an action book, and leaves you, again, with the impression of originality.       Being overall a good read, The Hunger Games does have a few downsides. Having the book told in first person generally works, but when Katniss has flash backs, and when she tells about her government and such, it gets a bit hazy and you find yourself wanting a better mental picture. Another downside of the book is that in several places, it leads you on to something that  never happens, like when the book talks in detail about Mockingjays, but then finishes up abruptly, with no final explanation. It is frustrating and pointless, and you end up confused. It could be that the author is setting up the sequel, however this should not have to be done at the expense of the first book as is done here.       I would recommend this book to other young adults because it is well written and the story is captivating. There are several things that are obnoxious, such as the leading on and flashbacks, but for the most part, this is a fun, exciting, engaging book. Most people will enjoy this, and not only is this a personal opinion, but by the sales of this  book, I think most would agree, The Hunger Games, is a very good read.

1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin is awesome.  If you haven't read his blog, search Google for Seth Godin's Blog and read his previous posts ... you'll be able to tell pretty quickly if his books are for you or not.   More often than not, Seth gives us free daily nuggets that make me think.   I'd pay for Seth's daily blog if I had to, so the pittance he charges for his books is MORE than worth your money or time.   Don't take my word for it, though.  Go read his blog for free, if you don't get enough value out of that to pay for this book, don't buy it.  If you do find the value in his blog that I do, there's very little risk involved in buying this book.  Now stop reading these reviews, go read his blog.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Considering the low price on this name brand watch, it's the best deal out there.  I've been comparing this watch to the atomic clock since Monday.  It's now Friday of the same week and it is consistently gaining a bit under 8 seconds per day.  The key factor about a watch's movement quality is consistency.  Even if consistently fast or slow, it's a good quality movement.  You don't want one that would gain 2 minutes one day and a few seconds the next day.  After almost a week with this Seiko I like it very much.  I don't care much for the faddish large diameter watches and this one is perfectly sized for me.  I even like the watch band.  Sized well for the watch and is comfortable.  Amazon shipping was amazing, received the watch in a couple of days and it was shown to be 5-7 days.  Excellent.
B0017OB12O|1.0|If you want a feel good about the brits type of movie, go ahead, but it's utterly cr@p from a historical perspective, with most men who worked in Jap prison camps boycotting the movie through its history.  A Blu-ray release is no reason to buy it, it's just HD fluff.
031603438X|3.0|I found this memoir quite amusing at first, but as Keef went on with his tips on how to be a great drunken junkie like himself, the plot ran a little thin.  And his anger at Mick Jagger for committing the crime of taking care of the business aspect of the Stones while Richards spent years stumbling around in a haze is laughable.  One can certainly see why Jagger tried to get away from this lot and attempt a solo career, a huge betrayal in Keith Richards' bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />Wait for the paperback, mates.
0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale is the story of Vida Winter, a prolific writer with a mysterious past.  She commissions a young writer named Margaret to pen her story, the \\"Thirteenth Tale\\".  Mrs. Winter tells the story of Angelfield, an avoided house that was home to spooky twin girls that terrorized the village.  The manor was run by their father, a recluse that never got over the unconventional love he had for his sister.  Mrs. Winter's tale, along with Diane Setterfield's intriguing writing, will draw you in as you are told the stories of Angelfield and its inhabitants.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is definitely for book lovers. My favorite quote is:<br />\\"There is something about words.  In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.  Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts.\\"

0743437497|5.0|Stephen King's epic horror novel was published in 1977.  The title was inspired by the John Lennon song Instant Karma! Containing the line \\"we all SHINE on.\\"  The success of the book soon turned into an epic film in 1980. Then it turned into a miniseries in 1997.  The Shining is an epic story about the Torrance family winter watching the Overlook hotel. Danny the Torrance family's son has a gift called the shinning. The shinning is you can either see in the future or what is going on that no other person can see. Danny can do both, and he sees some things that if you saw you would faint. These things torment him for a while. The Torrance family gets tormented for a long time.  Stephen king was a genius. There was a great setting. There were great characters. There is a great plot. All of that mixed together turns into a great book. The shinning is Stephen King's best book. If I had to rate this book one through ten I would give it a ten all the way. I would recommend this book to someone with a great imagination and a love for horror. Stephen King was a genius. The characters were great. A great setting, a great plot. Put together, it turns into a great book. I think that this is Stephen King's best book. If I had to give this book a rating of one through ten. I would give it a ten in a second. I recommend this book to anyone with a great imagination and a like for horror.
0312600844|4.0|Freedom moves with propulsive energy, barring some undeniably boring save-the-planet passages (which would probably not be boring to someone who wanted to save the planet).  One frequent criticism is that the characters are unlikable or flat.  I found them more likable than the characters in The Corrections and not stereotypical.  All the main characters are trying to do the right thing, by their lights, as are many of the minor characters; none of them are gratuitously mean.  But it isn't easy to do the right thing.  Franzen shows the life-long tug-of-war the three major characters experience between their desire to be honorable and their desire to be freely, irresponsibly happy.  It's a human dilemma and Franzen reveals the conflict between obligation and self-indulgence well, along with the self-deception that accompanies choices in one direction or another.  He also describes the competing obligations people feel and their difficulty in reconciling those opposing obligations.  To me these were enriching aspects of the novel.    Freedom highlights two different sets of male friendships:  primarily Walter and Richard's, and Joey and Jonathan's to a lesser extent.  Those friendships are very well drawn.  Richard and Joey appreciate the moral clarity and intellectual depth of their friends.  Richard in particular strives to honor his friend, even though some of his actions are betrayals which his specious reasoning cannot neutralize.  It is a male-centered novel, despite the sections that are supposedly written in the 3rd person voice of Patty.  I say \\"supposedly\\" because, as many reviewers have noted, Patty's voice is (with a few exceptions) indistinguishable from that of the narrator in other chapters.  She is distinct from the narrator in what she knows and who she is but not in how she writes.  Many reviewers have criticized this.  I don't know what Franzen's up to here, but he *could* have written those sections differently.  I think he made a deliberate choicenot to, as if that is the voice in which to discuss the themes of the novel.  Even though Patty's voice is the same as the narrator's, there's a claustrophobic feeling you have when you are immersed in her life; you give a sigh of relief when you can get outside her consciousness.  Some reviewers have objected that Patty ends up being too smart.  She is not initially presented as very smart, but I take it that that is the difference between looking from the outside vs the inside.  And two people, Walter and Richard, recognize her intelligence.  She's smart but she doesn't have thoughts that go beyond her narrow world.  Two of the younger women in the novel, in contrast to Patty, have paid employment and are altogether more self-confident and superficially intelligent, but they have few thoughts about their condition.    Some readers have criticized Walter's moment of becoming totally unhinged, as if it were not properly prepared.  Yet Franzen lays out Walter's obsessiveness from the start, along with his subterranean knowledge that he has gone over to the dark side by letting the ends justify the means.  He knows what he's been doing is wrong, but it takes drugs to free him.    Freedom is an ambitious book that doesn't completely fulfill its ambitions.  but it is an exhilarating ride.
0439023513|5.0|Book Review for Mocking Jay By, Suzanne Collins By Tony Phoenix     Mocking Jay is the 3rd book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It is by far the best book in the series. It is about Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Prim and Boggs who try to stop the Hunger Games forever. They go through a series of events that are not just difficult but also deadly. There were a lot of sad scenes in this book but it was worth finishing. This book has an amazing twist in the end that will make you sad and surprise you. Overall this book would get a rating of 5 stars from me.   There was a lot of killing in this book but I still liked it a lot. (Not the killing but the plot.) I liked that it wasn't about winning the Hunger Games but trying to stop them. I recommend this book for any kid over the age of ten. The concept of this book is too difficult for kids under the age of ten to comprehend.  They wouldn't enjoy it because it has a lot of advanced vocabulary words young kids wouldn't get because the words are difficult to understand. I hope you are looking forward to reading this book like I was.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Words can't really do justice to this beautiful and heartbreaking film but I'll try anyways.    Like the best art, Winter's Bone makes you almost forget that it is a work of fiction.    The performances are so honest, the filmmaking so unobtrusive and sensitive that at times you get the feeling that you are watching a documentary.    The film shows us a glimpse of a side of America that most of us will never see.      This is one of the few films that I've seen recently that I haven't been able to get out of my head.    Everybody needs to see this film.
142314189X|5.0|By, Yao Li<br />  The  book or series \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" by Rick Riordan is a great series. It is about Greek Mythology in modern day life, sons and daughters of Gods and Goddesses are brought to a camp called Camp Half Blood. They are taught how to fight and kill monsters and go on quests. They become heroes.<br /> The series focuses on Percy Jackson, the son of the sea god Poseidon. He starts to realize that he is a half blood (Demigod) in the first book, \\"The Lightning Thief.\\" He gets recruited to the camp and meets Grover, Annabeth and Luke who become main characters and play a big role in the book. Grover and Annabeth become Percy's best friends and Percy develops a crush on Annabeth. Luke betrays the Gods and Goddesses and the Demigods and joins the Titans in hopes of reviving the Lord of Time, leader of the Titans, Kronus.<br />  In the end, Luke and Percy bathe in the River Styx. This gives them the ability to withstand any blow as long as it is not on there 1 weak spot.<br />  Percy also gets some enemies like Clarisse, Daughter of Ares, Ares, God of War, and Hades, the God And Ruler of the Underworld himself. In the last book, \\"The Last Olympian,\\" Luke appears to have given his body to Kronus, and then the Titans and Typhon (the strongest monster in this book) attack the Olympians and the Demigods and Manhattan. A prophecy is given saying a hero will save the day but will die and they say it's Percy. Kronus and Percy battle but it's no use, Kronus is too strong.<br />  Annabeth convinces the Luke inside Kronus and takes over. His eyes turn normal again. Luke tells Percy to give him the knife, when he does, Luke reveals his weak spot and stabs it (defeating the Kronus inside), telling a dying message to Percy and Annabeth and dies.  Then, Percy realizes Luke was the hero in the prophecy.<br />  The theme of this book is to combine modern day life and Greek Mythology in one. My opinion of this book is that it is really good and worth reading.The book has a lot of action and comedic elements in it. Out of 10, I would give a 9.5 to each book  (The Lightning Thief, Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, Battle of Labyrinth, and The Last Olympian.)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just have to agree with the great reviews of this 'blew-me-away' blu ray!! Have all the titles on Laserdisc, DVD, and even Quad. DVD box set. Very afraid as to what Fox might do to these films (they are known as King of DNR)...not on this set! The DVD Quad box looked pretty good for DVD, but man! You have to experience these in hi-def! So, the price is steep (remember when the Quad box came out?) but it is well worth it!!! I actually got lost in the movie by the detail. If you are fan of the Alien films (all four) and love high definition, this set is for you! There is so much more to look at...don't even think DVD is 'good enough', rubbish!! You can't add to the picture what is not there. DVD is a dying format with titles like this being released! Thank you Fox for shutting us up with all the negative slack we have been given you. My only complaint is the way the discs are stored...the backs of these discs can easily be scratched if not careful when removing them (just don't man handle them).<br />I haven't even mentioned the sound...it too is awesome. You hear things that you never heard before.<br />Crank it up and enjoy. It's like watching these movies for the first time...I still have a smile on my face from the experience! This is the box set we have been waiting for. These movies are why 'blew-me-away' blu ray exists in the first place!!
0156030306|5.0|A Book Review On: Flowers for Algernon                                                                     By: Haley Anderson          Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is a true classic that really comes to life as you read it.  The book really made me appreciate living a normal life much more.  Thirty Five year old Charlie, (the main character), was always told that he could never be as smart as everyone else.  Charlie was forced to deal with being mentally challenged.  Lucky for Charlie, he had enough faith in himself to overcome everyone's doubts that he could be as smart as or even smarter than everyone else.        This book is about how scientists discover an experiment that is supposed to turn mentally challenged people into geniuses.  According to Alice, (Charlie's reading and writing teacher), he is the perfect candidate for this experiment.  Alice claims that Charlie is self-motivated to learn and could be trusted for this job.  Charlie has to have a special surgery for this experiment to work.  Will Charlie become a genius or will the experiment fail?  Read the book to find out.       This was a deep book that included a lot of life lessons and important facts of interesting knowledge.  Every couple of pages or so I had to stop and think about what I had just read.  This was a fantastic book that had suspense, heart, and dreams to make the book more entertaining.  If I had to judge how much I enjoyed this book, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best, I would definitely rate this book a 5!

Didn't make even 1/4 through before I realized three things:  1: I don't like this story or the writing style.  2: I have zero interest in what happens with the rest of the story or the characters.  3: Life is too short to waste on garbage.  I gave it away.

B003P2VBIK|4.0|Flash Forward by Robert J. Sawyer    I purchased this book because I really got into the television series that was based upon it.  The book is really good.  However, if you are looking for answers to the prematurely canceled series, you will not find them in this book.  The series was very loosely based on the book and there are a lot of differences.  For instance, the FBI appears nowhere in the book and there is no big conspiracy such as was in the series.  That said, the book is very interesting and well written.  It was my first experience with Robert Sawyer and I did purchase it because I wanted to see how the series ended.  To that extent, I was disappointed but I liked the book enough to read another book written by Robert Sawyer.  That's a big deal for me as I tend to be pretty finicky about who I read.
0689865384|5.0|Recently, I finished a book called \\"Uglies by\\" Scott Westerfeld. It's about a girl who lives in a world when you're 16, you turn pretty. But when you're not extremely pretty, you're considered ugly. All of the Uglies can't wait until they turn 16, and have a happy, pretty life. Well at least, most of the Uglies... Some of the Uglies know what actually happens when they turn you Pretty... what they do to your brain. This book is exciting and very eye-catching. Once you start to read, you can't stop! I really liked this book because of the interesting and exciting ideas. For example, the story was supposed to take place in the future. It has cool inventions, like things called hover board (which is a board that hovers.) The cool thing is that if we tried to build these things it would probably work. His realistic ideas make the story so hard not to believe. Also, it didn't have one boring part in it, and it really gave you deep questions.                  This book is in a series. The other books in the series are; \\"Pretties\\" \\"Specials\\" and \\"Extras\\" I recommend this book to people who are in middle school, and up. Scott Westerfeld has written adult novels before so he has a sophisticated style of writing.               In conclusion, I give \\"Uglies\\" a five star rating. It is a wonderful book and I hope you consider reading \\"Uglies.\\" I assure you that you will enjoy it. I know I did!
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|I know I put 3 stars, you have to put in something.    How can anyone rate this when it isn't out yet?    Amazon needs to change how things are reviewed.    Only reviews of people that actually bought the item from amazon should be accepted.    That would eliminate all the BULLSQUAT!
0439023491|5.0|In catching fire, the second book in Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy many exciting things happen.  Many new rebellions occur, and many new relationships evolve.  I think that this book was better than The Hunger Games and was the best in the trilogy.  There was a lot more action in this book and many high-stake relationships.  In this book, Peeta Mellark, Katniss Everdeen and all the other victors from previous hunger games are put back in the arena for the quarter quell. The tension between the Capitol and the districts is greater than ever.  This book has a fair amount of violence and romance.  I would strongly recommend this book to Harry Potter and Percy Jackson and The Olympians fans.<br /><br />If I could rate this book one to five I would rate it a five. I thought it exceeded standards and it was defiantly was a page turner and I read it in two days. Whole chapters followed Katniss's thought process.  Suzanne Collins was able to capture the setting and describe it in such great detail that you could picture yourself there. Emotions and characters are also described in great detail.<br />If you liked The Hunger Games, you will defiantly love this book .<br /><br />Another review of this book by Jake Leeno (5 stars)<br /><br />Catching Fire is on Fire!<br /><br />Catching Fire is the second book in the exciting Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. It is a great book and may even be better than the first book.<br /> In Catching Fire, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return to District 12 after winning the 74th Hunger Games against all odds. They start living in the Victor's Village with Haymitch, their former mentor and it seems like things will be alright. But after a threat from President Snow, a disheartening Victory Tour, and some signs of uprising, it looks as if Katniss and other victors will be heading back to the arena. But will Katniss stay alive again? Will the Districts still accept the Capitol's ways? And what will the 75th Hunger Games contain?<br />  What Suzanne Collins puts into this jewel is amazing. This book and the other books are great and awesome. This book is stunning and it makes you want to keep on reading until you get to the end. The characters, Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Gale, and more will make you love and hate them. I would give Catching Fire a 10 on a scale of 1-10. You could get a really clear picture in your head while reading this. This is a very suspenseful book and if you thought \\"The Hunger Games\\" was good, than you'll think that Catching Fire is GREAT.<br />Step aside Bella Swan, Katniss Everdeen is your heroine now!contain?<br />  What Suzanne Collins puts into this jewel is amazing.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|\\"Hereafter\\", the new film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Peter Mprgan (\\"The Queen\\", \\"The Last King of Scotland\\", \\"Frost/ Nixon\\") is as disappointing as a s&eacute;ance with a fake medium.<br /><br />George (Matt Damon) is the type of factory worker who makes \\"two grand a month\\" yet lives in a nice apartment in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world. George has a secret; he was once a psychic very much in demand. He did readings for many people, he had a website, he helped people talk to the dearly departed and he was qite sought after. In fact, he still is when people remember who he is. But George has always viewed this ability as a curse. He doesn't practice any more, except when pressured by his brother (Jay Mohr), and prefers to just work in his meaningless job. Because the slightest human contact can cause him to see things, he has also shied away from meaningful relationships. Meanwhile, a French television journalist, Marie (Cecile de France) and her show's producer and boyfriend vacation in a tropical paradise. On their last day, Marie wakes up early to shop for souvenirs when a tsunami hits. While under water, she has visions that haunt her far after their return to Paris. She takes time off from the show to write a book about the repression of the psychic world. In London, twin brothers, Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle trying to maintain a normal life with their drug-addict mom (Lyndsey Marshall, BBC's \\"Being Human\\"). When Jason dies, Marcus feels guilty and tries to find someway to contact him, visiting a number of people who profess to use different methods of contacting the dearly departed. Eventually, the three people will meet and help each other.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Eastwood's films and have had many long and passionate debates about \\"Unforgiven\\" with one of my best friends. She doesn't like the film. I have spent many hours trying to convince her this is the great film many recognize. However, she obstinantly refuses to see she is wrong. But we agree about \\"Hereafter\\", although her reaction was a little stronger than mine. She said it was the first film in a long time in which she has actually wanted her money back, she felt robbed. I wouldn't go that far. But there are a lot of problems with \\"Hereafter\\", so many that thornhill can't recommend it.<br /><br />Let's start with the ending. After watching two hours of somber, maybe even somnambulistic storytelling, Eastwood and Morgan have designed an ending that is just so out of place it rings completely false. Worse, for two men who have created some of the most memorable films in recent memory, it rings like an ending more suited for a television show. Obviously, I can't reveal what happens, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. And as this is the last moment we spend in this universe, a bad last image is not a good thing.<br /><br />Next, we have Matt Damon. I get why he walks through the story as though he is sleepwalking, but it doesn't make his character very engaging. George is trying to stave off the nightmares, he gets nightmares when he has the visions, he has visions when he touches people, and he touches people when he meets them. To prevent all of this from happening, George is simply lonely, preferring to spend many hours in his apartment alone. He spends much of his time working in a factory, driving a forklift. Throughout, George walks through the film as though he wishes he were dead. And to portray this, Damon simply keeps his face blank or impassive throughout. It isn't real engaging to watch one of the more engaging actors of our generation walk somberly through the storty.<br /><br />The best part of the film, involves a cooking class George decides to take at an Extension program. There, the chef (Steve Schirippa) teams him up with Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). Over the course of their relationship, we see illustrations of everything we are supposed to know about George. These moments gives us a better idea of who and what George is supposed to be in twenty minutes.<br /><br /> I wish there had been more of these moments and fewer moments of George walking around with a dour, pained expression on his face. This would have increased the pacing of the film and helped to move the story along, making the overall film better.<br /><br />Cecile de France (come on, is that her real name?) plays Marie, the rancorous journalist who is famous for raking her interview subjects over the coals. After she begins to have her visions, she decides  to investigate and finds the study of the after life, of the hereafter, has never been taken seriously. She decides to write a book about it and shelves the other book her publisher has paid her for. Naturally, he is reticent to publish something \\"more suitable for the Americans\\". This is an interesting idea, but the storyline eventually plays out as something barely plausible. Because the study is not taken seriously, she investigates and has long conversations with her boyfriend, with a doctor, with other people. In an effort to make this part of the story work, these long conversations and investigations have the opposite effect. Instead, Marie's journey becomes an illustration of an old stereotype of French culture. People sit in groups and endlessly discuss.<br /><br />It isn't a great idea to include tons of interviews and discussions in a fiction film. Film is a visual medium and should illustrate a story with images, with action, with movement.<br /><br />Also, we don't really know what Marie was like before. Before the tsunami. Before the visions. All we know is that she is famous. What would have really helped this story is to show us an example of how Marie used to be, perhaps grilling some company executive on her television show. This would provide a nice counterpoint to the interview she conducts after returning from vacation. Her producer tells her to rip into the subject. But she can't concentrate and lets him off easy.<br /><br />The story of Marcus and Jason is the most interesting and the most believable. The McLaren brothers, who play the twins, are very naturalistic giving us a look at how two real brothers might deal with the situation. As Marcus deals with the Foster system in London and his attempts to contact Jason, everyone around him seems very natural as well, as though we might be eavesdropping on a conversation.<br /><br />You may not be aware of this, but Eastwood has been very involved in the music of his films for decades. This passion led him to direct \\"Bird\\" and he has scored and or composed the music for many of his films. Lately, he was also started to play the music, plucking out chords on a guitar in the background. This worked during \\"Gran Torino\\" (and Eastwood even sings during the closing credits) but in \\"Hereafter\\", this same guitar playing, selectively used throughout, only serves to make the pace of the film seem even more somnambulistic.<br /><br />Essentially, the \\"Hereafter\\" is not a place I want to visit again and that isn't something I have said about a lot of Eastwood's films.what George is supposed to be in twenty minutes.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|I`m a voracious reader and this is easily one of my favorite books. Moving, spiritual and funny. A must read.
B000NQPZCY|1.0|I would first like to say Revenge is one of my all-time favorite movies.  And I am also a huge Tony Scott fan.  So when I recently bought my first Blu-Ray player this was the first movie I purchased.  Before watching Tony's actual Director's Cut, I watched his brief commentary segment on the disc about his vision for a Director's Cut.  Surprisingly, Tony is very open and candid about how he feels Director's Cuts are supposed to be.  Specifically, Tony likes to cut through some of the fluff (to paraphrase)and get to the meat of the story.  Unfortunately in this case, that \\"fluff\\" is actually essential character development.  While Tony does give you some never before seen footage, this film is actually about 15 minutes shorter than the original.  Therefore, you're losing a good 20 minutes (or more) of necessary content.  Had Tony added the new footage to the original, the finished product would have been markedly better.  I watched this Director's Cut with my spouse who had never before seen the film and we were forced to constantly pause the movie while I was answering questions as to what was going on, what the characters' motivations were and how the story had arrived at its current state.  So, stick with the original if you're looking for the best portrayal of this story.  As a fan, I enjoyed this version in seeing the new footage and experiencing the story being told in a different, accelerated manor.  But I would not recommend the Director's Cut in any way as being better than the original.  On a side note, it is tough to find but the soundtrack to this film is outstanding.  Nitzsche's original compositions are some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.  Hope this helps.
0312600844|3.0|I loved The Corrections and couldn't wait to read Freedom, expecting to rush to Amazon to give it a 5-star review.  After being virtually canonized by the critics, it seemed to be as much of a sure thing as reading Don Quixote. I was sadly mistaken.<br /><br />Franzen's writing is flowing and almost poetic throughout this book to be sure; and he captures individual angst and personal oddities better than any other contemporary writer of fiction.  The problem with Freedom is the content.  Instead of the humorous and deep look at a dysfunctional family like we saw in The Corrections, Freedom feels more like a superficial (and unrealistic) glossing of characters used as a vehicle to give the reader a 500 page sermon on a series of ecological and other left-wing agenda items.  Any topic or character channeling the political right is categorically dismissed and cynically marginalized, making this book read like a moveon.org selection of the month (if there were such a thing). The one family member who dips his toe in the right-wing water via an entirely implausible evil scheme to sell broken truck parts to the military in Iraq quickly sees the error of his ways and donates his ill gotten gains to noble left-wing causes.  The corporations are all evil, the environmentalists good, and I felt like I was in a college rally at Berkeley in 2008.<br /><br />Late in Freedom, Franzen sacrifices his own characters to further bludgeon a particular issue clearly dear to his heart: The ecological damage caused by feral cats.  Instead of an expected chapter on how a main character handles the aftermath of an intensely emotional event, the reader is lectured through this character about how many birds are killed by feral cats annually......for the third time since the beginning of the book.  I certainly empathize with Franzen's position; I don't like the idea of cats running wild either, but Franzen abandoned his characters to belabor the point.  By the time we get back to the story, it feels like Franzen is up against a deadline, because suddenly everything works out.  For everyone.  Voila!<br /><br />I was also perplexed that Franzen all but ignored the daughter of the family; we learn nothing about Jessica, even while intimate details of the rest of the family are covered.  Poor Jessica is an afterthought, and I wonder if Franzen regretted introducing her but was too lazy to edit her out of the story later.<br /><br />Freedom began so very promising.  I liked this crazy liberal family and couldn't wait to see what became of them; but as the story progressed, so did the quantity of tortured sermons, until eventually the characters just sort of faded away and I was left wondering what cause I was supposed to donate to.ranzen is up against a deadline, because suddenly everything works out.

1400063736|1.0|I purchased this at my own risk, so there was nobody to blame but myself. And the author, maybe. And the prize, definitely, for misrepresenting the book, on top of keeping the library copies from being accessible any earlier.  I ended up buying the book when the waiting lists for the library copies grew even longer due to the prize this novel received. Consequently the level of my scrutiny was automatically heightened. I could have given 2 stars if I read this in the library copy. Yet, I would have returned it before reading it cover to cover. The only reason I finished this was because, after all, I bought it. Darn it, the money was wasted so was the time.<br /><br />I struggled to finish this book and it was frustrating and boring to death. I examined why; the writing did not live up to the vision the author initially might have held to write the novel. So only his hypothesis was worthy while it did not have any substantial support. The meat--text-- was not too good to substantiate and deliver the very idea the hypothesis held; aren't we all tightrope walkers? This was also the notion that I had when I saw Man on Wire--the documentary film on Petit the actual figure who performed the tightrope walk in 74 in between WTC skyscrapers. So when the same idea came out from the author in his radio interview once, before the award was given to the novel, I was doomed to read this novel.<br /><br />This book was saturated with sentimentality that made it overall too syrupy --saccharine sweet emotional diarrhea--and all was for the author's vanity and complacency. All the different characters' different voices and perspectives fell flat and as opposed to giving the reader a panoramic view as the author seemingly aimed in the first place. I just saw cataloging here rather than anything like effective juxtaposition. Plotting diversity just by it--letting the priest befriend with the lowest-lives possibly imagined-- is artistically and philosophically shallow and lazy. The penchant for objectification of sexworkers from the housing project was seriously unknown had it not been for glorification of the 'unconventional' priest's unlikely therefore valuable charity. Unfortunately, the depiction of 'girls' only read more patronizing than anything the author wished it to be. I believe he should have tried to construct the novel without the superficial employment of 'the others.' Focusing just Petit the tightrope walker and certain people whom he could earnestly invest his interest and passion in could have made the novel any better than what it really was. The text seriously needed more drastic editorial decision to reduce into even half of what's in print. What the author needed was that kind of courage, not looking into the Bronx to seek out the ultimate 'others' to show his ego off. Also, transplanting 9/11 situation into Vietnam era was such an easy solution that it only panned out implausible. Too overwritten on top of being too sentimental and superficial, I wonder if this was what other reviewers called 'pretentious.' Or complacency, I would rather put it to. The choppy and fragmented sentences did not surmount the ambitious structure, either.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the author's interview more than reading the book, let alone paying for it. But, hey, we are all tightrope walkers, and that I agree with, after all.ation of sexworkers from the housing project was seriously unknown had it not been for glorification of the 'unconventional' priest's unlikely therefore valuable charity.

B000F8O35U|1.0|I placed an order for two copies of the Little Mermaid from an Amazon  third party supplier (Yeomanill) several weeks ago. After a few days, I received one of the copies which arrived in a damaged case. The disc inside worked, but I wasn't happy with the condition in which we got it. A day or so later, I received an email telling me my order was delivered and I was billed for both of the sets I ordered.     I contacted Amazon to file a complaint, and they directed me to their customer support portal through I could contact Yeomanill directly. I emailed a complaint to them explaining the situation, and wanted them to send the second item or remove the charge for it. A week later I sent another email stressing the same request.    It's been nearly a month since I received half of my order, and a week and a half since sending my second complaint. I've heard nothing yet.    I have never had a problem with Amazon, but I strongly advise you never to order anything from Yeomanill.

There is just something so amazing and engaging in the way this very diverse and talented group of artists work together....I can't praise it enough.  But get the Bonus version if you can, it's worth it for \\"Never Enough\\" and a very nice accoustic take on \\"The Bleeding\\"

B00005OCMR|5.0|Ok my wife gave it 3 stars, but she is a Scientist.  So was I, but I program in place of reading a book.  Here is my take on the movie that I gave someone...    Anyway, the 20 minute TRON Legacy preview was visually great.  I hope the story line is not shallow though.  I haven't seen the original TRON in a long time, but here is what I got out of it when I was in Elementary School (many people missed the deep meanings and couldn't get past the visuals).  They must have been Apple IIc users and not Commodore PET/CBM :)    The programs that are created by the users are an embodiment of the programmers (writers) themselves.  Each programmer has a unique style of writing.  Ask 20 of them to write a store checkout button and you will have 20 different ways that it was written.    Since each program is an embodiment of the user, they naturally are in the same social hierarchy within the system.  The MCP is just as ruthless and emboldened to win it all as his original creator.  Anyone that is involved with the Genome races knows that depending on who you are, how much money, and connections; you can get more resources to analyze data on grids.    There is the question of religion in the system just like in the real world.  The user is a creator, but no one ever believed it since they never met one.  An ongoing theme throughout the movie that really makes you think.    There are limited resources that are fought over within a computer system just like the real world.  Food (electricity), Communication (IO), Cycles, etc.    Rogue programs or programs that the system is not aware of are collected out of the system, and in this case used as slaves for entertainment and work.  A rogue program can ultimately eat the system out of memory and/or cycles.  This is called Garbage cleanup to programmers.    Back in the days you would run the command:    >tracer on    or short hand:    >TRON    to find out where there is a program in the code.    To bad the MCP didn't counter with:>tracer off    or    >TROFF    Too bad the critics just don't have enough knowledge to truly critique a well written masterpiece.  They were blinded by the visuals.
0143037757|5.0|This is an ambitious book. It's also an impassioned account of the last 60 years of European History. Judt discloses in his Introduction that his is an \\"opinionated\\" book, and that's what I usually expect from a good history book. Historians that shield themselves in objectivity display boring and usually uninteresting accounts. The most impressive feature (and related to the former) of this work are its  insights. One of the reviews says that there are insights in almost every (of the 900) page. I found that to be only a slight exaggeration.<br /><br />Tony Judt covers an impressive amount of history in this book without getting lost in the details that would make its reading forgettable. One of the basic \\"subplots\\" is , of course, the arch of Eastern European Communism. The narration of it's rise, fall and demise and its interaction with the West in the Cold War context is extremely well accomplished. The other (and related) subplot is Western European Welfare State. The differences, advantages and disadvantages compared to the American system permeate the whole book, and it's one of Judt's most impassioned topics. One can agree or not with the author, but his is an interesting analysis specially in the current European climate. The causes of a European Union and its future are another topic of great interest. Some reviews have mention some factual errors. I found that to be the case, but they can be treated as \\"typos\\" and they don't really affect the analysis.<br /><br />The science and culture coverage is not complete. This in understandable in a book that covers an extensive period of time, but it's good to point the omissions here.  Other reviewers have pointed out the missing information on science, which is true. The coverage on music is only marginal, and only for the decade of The Sixties. The book focuses mostly on literature and movies. There's great coverage on french intellectuals (one of Judt's areas of expertise) and a lot of movies references across the book. I found these really useful to \\"follow up\\" on some topics.<br /><br />Most of the historical perspective is narrated with an \\"insight into the future\\", that is, events are analyzed not from its local perspective, but from the awareness that knowing the outcome (during our present) gives us. The Epilogue, which brings this type of narration full circle, is a little masterpiece on it's own. It's a (poetic and social) summary of the whole Post-War European History, and also a justification of the type of history the author think is really valuable.nd these really useful to \\"follow up\\" on some topics.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl With the Tattoo is a wonderful book and should be read by anybody who would enjoy a thrilling page turner. The Book is a great testament to how ordinary people can do horrible things, and how women are treated in sweden. At the beginning of every chapter, there is a statistic about the number of rapes and murders that take place every year, to show you how women are treated in sweden. The story starts off very slow, but don't let the beginning fool you, you will not be able to put this book down. Nearly everybody who has read the book would say that you could easily skip the first 50 or so pages without hurting the story. But once the book starts up, you will be up at night reading it unable to put it down.<br />The story starts out with the trial of Blowmkvist, who is convicted of libel against Herr Wennerstr&ouml;m. Blomkvist had exposed Wennerstr&ouml;m's illegal activities which included drug, gun and sex trafficking. Wennerstr&ouml;m however is very well connected, and has Blomkvist set up op he can be convicted of libel. The story further complicates with the addition of the character of Lisbeth Salander, a genius hacker, who is viewed by the government as mentally unstable. She is put under the care of Advokat Bjurman, who takes control of her bank accounts and manipulates her life. Salander is put up to the task of spying on Mickael blomkvist for a reclusive businessman named Henrik Vanger. Vanger contacts Blomkvist and asks him to investigate his family history and find the murderer of his niece who he loved like a daughter. Harriet disappeared over 30 years ago, but the events surrounding her death were unusual to say the least. She disappeared on an island, which the only way off of was a bridge which happened to be closed because of an accident. Also the only people on the Island were her extended family. Henrik Vanger commissions Blomkvist to do an investigation into the family's history, and he is aided by Salander who later proves to be a priceless asset.<br />All in all I would most definitely give this book 5 stars, because once you pick it up, you can't put it down. This book is an addictive, and that goes for the other two books in the series. If I could sum up my opinion in two words: read it.All in all I would most definitely give this book 5 stars, because once you pick it up, you can't put it down.

B00000JS1M|5.0|This album is incredible! Best Saxon album. I just wish they hadn't dropped the track \\"Suzie Hold On\\" which is on the LP I have. For those that haven't heard this version of the track (no it's not the same version as the one on Wheels of Steel), it really rocks! It's the same song as on Wheels but done differently and much better!!!! And the Eagle Has Landed is an awesome track. Reminds me of my earlier days listening to hard rock on KISW...  :-)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've always been hesitant about getting a wireless headset, but after accidentally yanking the wires out of the splice on two consecutive pairs of [[ASIN:B002BH3JDA Creative Labs HS-980 Fatal1ty Professional Series MKII Gaming Headset (Black)]] I decided it was time to try wireless.    The result has been fantastic.    Not only do they sound as good if not better than my previous sets, but they have 7.1 surround instead of 5.1. They sound amazing.    The wireless range is outstanding, I can go anywhere in my house and still have absolutely pristine reception.    The volume wheel is great, especially when using the set to listen to music or have a conversation via Voip from another room away from the computer. It feels smooth and accessible.    The programmable G-keys are fantastic, My personal usage is to bind one to next track, one to play/pause, and one bound to toggle mouse 5 (my push to talk button). The only downfall is that it apparently isn't possible to have it transmit while you hold the button down and stop when you release, in order to do push-to-talk from what I can see you have to do a toggle. (ie push it once you are transmitting, push again you stop). But still, the 3 G-keys and volume wheel let me use Voip and listen to music from away from my computer.    The battery life seems great so far and the meter in the program seems accurate. I haven't gotten to put it to a full test yet, but I fully expect that it at least comes close to the 9-10 hours it claims. And when you need to charge, all it takes is plugging it in to the docking station or any usb to mini usb cable, and you don't even have to stop using them! So the only inconvenience charging poses is that you have to use it like a normal headset while it charges.    It rests comfortably and doesn't hurt my ears even after hours of use.    I would recommend this to anyone who is considering a wireless set. Especially if you're like me and you've destroyed one too many wired sets.

0812973992|4.0|Incredible read.  Captured the essence of NYC during the late '60's early '70's.  Pulled no punches regarding street life.  Great narrative.
0525951652|4.0|First of all. This is one HUGE book!  Over 1,000 pages!  Even the list of characters is six pages of 9 point type.  So don't start this book unless you have some time to devote to a delicious story.<br /><br />In the true tradtion of Ken Follett, this is one of his most aspiring epic tales.  It only covers about 14 years - before, during and after WWI.  But he leads you across Europe and with much research, draws the reader into not only the history of the era but the emotional and political undercurrents.  If you like history, it's all here.  If you like the saga of great families, it's here, too.  And, as only the first of a trilogy, I can't wait until the next books comes out.<br /><br />Fall of Giants might be too big for a vacation read, but it certainly is worthy of a winter snuggle by the fire.<br /><br />Great book for your most-loved bibliophile.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Great CD! I have been a fan for years now, and this CD has a little bit of everything from Youth and Young Manhood, to Aha Shake, Because of the Times, and Only by the Night(least favorite, in my opinion). It's not the most intense album by them, but it has solid tracks that keep you listening over and over again!
0385342047|1.0|I have never read any previous Kinsella novels but I can't imagine anything more purile and shallow.  This book is pure drivel. Where on earth do people actually put this much time into aquiring expensive stupid stuff?  And...to coach their children into doing the same?<br /><br />Minnie is a brat and should get a good spanking or at least time in the corner.  Becky is a apineless whimp where Minnie is concerned.  (I would have left Minnie throwing a tantrum in the middle of the store in the first scene.)  Minnie will never grow up until her mother does.<br /><br />Sophie, PLEASE, give your characters some character.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is an inspiriation to any female struggling with who she is in a world that defines people in very small boxes.  The early 20th century had narrow definitions for a young girl's path to success.  Today, we have wider paths and more possibilities - but challenges still persist. Can you identify them?  Love as a theme takes on many faces. Renee Z was superior as Beatrix. A movie the whole family can watch together and talk about.
0316069485|4.0|\\"Return to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you.\\" -- Genesis 31:3 (NKJV)<br /><br />Reversal is a great title for this book because that theme is carried through in several dimensions of the story:<br /><br />Rather than keeping half-brothers, Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch, at arms length, they become the core of a prosecution and investigative teach that's mightily aided by Mickey's ex-wife, Maggie McPherson. Naturally, with so much familial closeness, there are bound to be opportunities for Mickey's and Harry's daughters to be brought together as well.<br /><br />Another reversal is that Mickey goes over from defending sleazy characters to taking on a prosecution, as an independent prosecutor (although not as independent as he would like).<br /><br />Of course, a central reversal is the court ruling that leads to a retrial of Jason Jessup, who had been convicted of killing a child. It is this reversal that sets things in motion.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if there might not be a few more reversals before the book end, ones that I cannot mention now without affecting your enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />The strength of this book is the Harry Bosch story line. If you are like me, you may find yourself wishing that Michael Connelly had written a Bosch-based detective story rather than a playful novel that puts Bosch into the background for much of the time.<br /><br />If I could give half stars, I would rate this one at three-and-a-half. I found the last 100 pages to be not up to the rest of the book. You'll have to see what you think.<br /><br />I cannot help but note that the Kindle version of this book is way overpriced. Why do publishers do that?

B003TML0VO|5.0|I listened to half the album, and loved it.  Then I came here to see what folks were saying, and found out that I was supposed to hate it.  So I went and listened to it all a couple more times.  Hey, maybe the title sets you up for a bit more, but I think that is all in good fun.  Anyone with the nerve to do covers of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton gets five stars from me.  They covers are done right:  not too much the same, not too different, and there are sounds that I've never heard before.  Carlos is creative.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|After all, how exciting is it to learn that Mr Follett was kicking off a new trilogy? After the agonizing 10 years between Pillars of the Earth and World Without End which was well worth the wait (as opposed to Dan Brown's disappointment but that is another review for another time).  The average rating before I started reading was 2 stars, astonishing given the great writing on the aforementioned duology. Come to find out it was reviewers who had hijacked the review process to protest the price of the Kindle version. How unfair to Mr Follett.  Having gotten that out of the way, I loved this book for its entertainment value, the historical backdrop was terrific (even though we know the outcome of all of them) and the author's ability to take so many different strands and knit them in parallel is a blast, keeps the book from becoming overwhelming and provides constant changing of venue.   I eagerly await the next in the series. Please God it is not 10 years.
B003ODL004|5.0|I loved the music in the movie.  Having the CD is great.  The music comes alive and is wonderful to listen to as I am typing at work.  It is passionate and well played.  Loved it, highly recommend it!
B000002UAU|4.0|The judgment of critical history, and the opinion of most fans, is that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is The Beatles' best album. However there is a large minority opinion that would point to Abbey Road instead. I fall into the latter camp. The reason is that Abbey Road is a more consistent effort; while there is some amazing stuff on Sgt. Pepper, about a third of the songs are arguably not that great.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" which sets the conceit for the project, i.e. that this is a recording of a concert by a fictional band and their lead singer Billy Shears. Though Sgt. Pepper is considered an early example of a concept album, once we're past the first two songs that idea is dropped and not really picked up again until the \\"Reprise\\" near the end. All the other songs really could have fitted onto any album, the \\"concert\\" idea is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />During the recording of Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles had recently stopped touring and decided to be only a studio band from then on. Paul McCartney came up with the idea, partly I think to kinda-sorta keep them in touch with their touring/live performance roots, to do a concept album that would be a \\"live recording\\" of a concert by a fictional band. After the first few songs however, John Lennon said, \\"This is stupid, I don't want to do it anymore.\\" So they didn't.<br /><br />Moving on past the intro, the only other song that continues on with the \\"concert\\" idea with dubbed-in crowd noises and such is \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" - a great song, in my opinion.<br /><br />Then it's into \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". There was a big whoop-de-doo when this song was released because of the idea that its title was a stealth drug reference to LSD. However John Lennon who primarily wrote the song says that's not true. I'm sure he'd admit it if it had been. This is the guy who had no problem copping to \\"thousands\\" of acid trips, so I don't think he wasgonna lie about where this song came from. According to John, the idea came from a nursery school drawing his young son Julian brought home one day which was of a classmate and he'd drawn stars all around her. When John said, \\"That's a great drawing, what it it?\\" Julian answered, \\"That's Lucy - in the sky with diamonds.\\" Now, if you're most people you'd go, \\"Wow, cute comment.\\" If you're John Lennon you proceed on to write one of The Beatles' best songs, that even decades later is still wowing people.<br /><br />\\"Getting Better\\" is another winner. So far, so good.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"Fixing a Hole\\", \\"She's Leaving Home\\", and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" are, to me anyway, boring. \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" was, according to John Lennon who also wrote it, inspired by an old circus poster he saw one day. That's where the ideas for the imagery, events and imaginary people in the song came from. In my opinion, in this song John is trying to pull off very much the same sort of psychedelic imagery and charming effect as with \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" much less successfully.<br /><br />\\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" are both nice. Not earth shaking, mind you, just nice.<br /><br />I have a real soft spot for \\"Lovely Rita\\". I think it's one of The Beatles' best songs.<br /><br />\\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is boring.<br /><br />Then we have the \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\" which ends the \\"concert\\". Fair enough.<br /><br />I've always wondered why they put \\"A Day In the Life\\" after the end of the \\"Reprise\\". Really, if we accept the idea of the concert, that makes no sense. But there it is. I can only assume it's because following that final, magnificent piano chord that seems to go on FOREVER with anything else would have been sacrilege.<br /><br />Structurally this is a very interesting song. It was co-written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The song has three verses, the first and last written by John,the middle section by Paul. John's portions of the song were inspired by contemporary events such as the death of a close friend (and heir to the Guinness fortune) in a car accident, or reading a newspaper article about the sad state of the streets and the number of potholes in Blackburn, a city in Lancashire, whereas McCartney's portion is reminiscent of his youth in which a commuter's uneventful morning routine (during which he does things McCartney had done when younger - smoking, riding the bus to school, attending classes) leads him to drift into a dream.<br /><br />The first Lennon verse and the McCartney verse is separated by a 24-bar orchestral crescendo. When primary recording was done, there was still a missing 24-bar middle section. Paul McCartney wanted to fill it with an orchestral bridge. Originally he had wanted a 90-piece orchestra; when this proved impossible, what he got was a 40-piece orchestra, their section recorded multiple times, eventually four different recordings being overdubbed into a single, massive, incredibly lush crescendo. During initial recording - we're talking pre-orchestra here - George Martin's assistant Mal Evans' voice had counted out the 24 bars, and the counting ended with the sound of a ringing alarm clock triggered by Evans. This sound was incorporated it into the song, to brilliant effect, leading into the first line of McCartney's section, \\"Woke up, got out of bed...\\"<br /><br />Then after McCartney's comparatively reality-based middle section, we're back into more John Lennon dreamy weirdness for the final verse. Thus - to me, anyway - the effect is of a stream of consciousness from a person who is only casually hooked into reality. The song begins with a dream, then the dreamer wakes, however is not able to stay in reality even when awake. In short order, after the morning routine keeps him temporarily grounded, he can't maintain that and slips right back into a dream - only this time it's a waking dream. \\"A Day In the Life\\" is my favorite Beatles song - actually my single favorite song, period - a fine and worthy end to the album.<br /><br />BTW, from Wikipedia, about that final piano chord:<br /><br />\\"Following the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the Harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.\\"<br /><br />So, my final assessment of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: four of its 13 songs, for me, miss the mark. The album starts and ends well, but it's a bit soft around the middle. Whereas Abbey Road is good all the way through. So when it comes to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band versus Abbey Road as the best-ever Beatles album, put me down for Abbey Road.
1401324029|4.0|I overall liked the book, and I also thought it was better than 'Heat Wave', because it felt more like a proper mystery, not just another 'Castle' episode in book form. The main problem with it was how elements used in season 3 (after the book was written, story-wise) are used first in the show. I know Rick Castle would use experience gathered during his work with Beckett, but with one thing happening in the book, and then just a week later, the same thing happens on the show. You just plainly see that it's one of the writers of the show who wrote the book, and then later took some of the same ideas and used it in an episode.    But worth the read!

B002WCLG3O|4.0|The first two episodes are great, without a doubt the highlight of the seven stories. I'm a great fan of anime and HALO, so I decided to check this out, its good but weird. Its not anime in itself, rather an attempt of anime by western creators, the thing is that the HALO stories were actually done by japaneese artist and directors so I guess they were trying to envision a western public since HALO isn't that big in Japan. And you definitely feel that in the stories, so bottom line: if you like HALO and just want to have some fun on random stories about HALO not of HALO itself then you will like this movie, if you want true anime... this is not it, although its not bad, and if you want some background or obscure stories about the game... then this is also not for you.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|In American movies, we don't often see how we really live, but you will in Winter's Bone, and you don't need to have had a rough childhood in the back woods for this movie to make you feel the grittiness and glory of life -- or for you to know, like you would know how to find your bed in the dark, that this is probably the best movie you will see this year. And maybe longer.<br /><br />Winter's Bone, directed by Debra Granik, was adapted from a novel by Daniel Woodrell. It was made in the Ozarks, often in the homes of the people who live there. Shot digitally on a mingy budget, it could pass for state-of-the-art Hollywood --- just raw and unvarnished, like Hollywood never is.<br /><br />The story is simple; this is a straightforward thriller. Ree's father, Jessup Dolly, was busted a while back for cooking methamphetamine. To make bond, he put up his family's house and 300 acres of virgin timber. Now his court date is a week away --- and he's nowhere to be found. The local lawman drives out to warn Ree that the Dollys are in danger of losing their home.<br /><br />Ree's mother has suffered a breakdown and is of no help, either in caring for her children or finding her husband. That puts her daughter --- already burdened by the need to look after her younger brother and sister --- on a mission. And don't think for a minute she'll quit, even though her quest is a walk on a knife edge; she can't turn in her father, all she can do is ask for help in finding him so she can talk to him. And the only people who can help her? His relatives. Some of them make the most addictive drug on the planet. All of them don't understand why she can't remember she's a Dolly --- \\"bred and buttered,\\" as she says --- and just stop. As they say, \\"Talking just causes witnesses.\\"<br /><br />In its dramatic revelations, its dark surprises, and its no-nonsense portrayal of The Way We Are, the film feels almost like a Greek tragedy --- or an American Western.<br /><br />There's a good reason this film won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Films and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at Sundance last winter, and why critic after critic is reaching deep into the superlatives lexicon to praise it as \\"the American film of the year\\" -- every detail is right.

B00005OAE6|5.0|Great Price, timely delivery, Love listening to the songs of my teenage years.  I saw Bob Segar and the Silver bullet band 3 or 4 times as a teen.   I had all the albums, then tapes,  now I've got to switch over to cds.   No problems.  Thank you
0307592839|1.0|I tried reading it and bailed out before getting through the first chapter, so it isn't fair that I rate this, but it should mean something that I was bored so quickly.
0439023513|4.0|Very nice book.  Least favorite of the three - I didn't like the ending.  But the book itself is well made.
B003N5VOUO|2.0|As another reviewer pointed out, this movie tries to be too many things at once: terrorism and the prejudice against Muslims, understanding for people with autism, social justice, love, finding yourself and your place in the world despite shortcomings etc. You wonder if this movie is social commentary or romance or about self discovery. It is just too much. The acting by Shahrukh Khan is also too much. You can see he is acting and no good actor should look like they are acting. They need to look like they are truly the character they are portraying. Some of the scenes were painful to watch and bordered at sheer embarrassing. And i am ok with that actually: Bollywood movies are supposed to be embarrassing and over-the-top by tapping into the stereotypes of movie making from like 40 years ago. But when the movie attempts to be serious but turns out a grotesque farce, then suddenly the joke is on the makers.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I watched the series on HBO.  To say I was excited to watch it is an understatement.  I loved BOB and I was hopeful this series would be as good or better.  It is not.  It has some very good aspects to it and some compelling stories.  However, it does not have the scope or inspirational qualities of BOB.  There is very much time spent on backstory and the \\"homefront\\" which is interesting and \\"real\\" but not compelling viewing.  It seems story was sacrificed for \\"realism\\" and some of the episodes are boring and/or depressing.  Again I'm sure this is what war was like and it is a perspective we need to have.  However, it is not good cinema.  The war in the Pacific was a brutal \\"no prisoners\\" sort of war and it was more brutal and nasty than the Western Front in WWII.  Focusing on the problems that created for individual soldiers is necessary to give a true account of the conflict.  I don't see the need to have that issue take up an entire episode.  The Pacific doesn't give you a feel for the broad conflict and at times it felt like the rest of the war didn't exist.  After the first few episodes I no longer looked forward to watching the future episodes.  I recorded the show when it was on HBO so I don't need to buy it but I haven't bothered to rewatch any of them anyway.  Unlike BOB which I have watched and rewatched several times.  I may pick up the Pacific on DVD when it hits the bargain bin which will probably be sooner than later since it is already heavily discounted and it hasn't been released yet!
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|This adapter is not cheap and, as noted by others, should be included with your new Mac purchase.  That said, its a great adapter and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Works great to connect my new Mac to an excellent 24\\" Samsung monitor.    Note: white noise is displayed on the screen if the Mac falls asleep before the monitor goes to sleep.  It disappears after the Mac wakes up.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The packaging pays tribute to this great series. Its made with a stone-like paper and includes a lot of little pieces to have fun. The only thing I regret is that they could`ve used the book to include different information than the episode list (which you can find in the dvd boxes for each season). Open the ankh and find somethig, read the piece of paper from the Black Rock and you`ll know a little backstory and try to find out the purpose of the blue-light lantern (check the black side of one of the pieces)... and of course, there`s the whole series and its extras to watch over and over.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|After a bit of cheese and a few cliches, this series really takes off. I was put off a bit watching the first episode (the pilot), especially when Spartacus takes a piece of leather and asks his wife to keep it close to her thighs to remember him by. But after that it gets much, much better. We've finally got a new cinematic technique; I've been waiting for a new one since the slow-mo-speed-up of Matrix (this went so far as Watchmen, even, for goodness's sake); the film technique here is interesting in that you often see a character moving through space and the background scrolls the movement of time. King of neat stuff for a viewer. It's a difference, at least, that matters as you're watching. (It loses a bit in the retelling.) These stories are very sexy, very bloody, including nudity. It's not for the kiddies, but it's the best of the new HBO-Home-Theater-esque TV serial. By the second or third episode, I was captivated in spite of myself. Good stuff.
B00005JO1R|5.0|The discs, and case were in great condition. The price is fantastic, and the seller is willing to give full details on the item.
1441866868|5.0|When I want to know how the bar is being raised in current science fiction, I look to Paolo Bacigalupi. This book is extremely well done and takes on the issue of genetic engineering of foods and people and so much more. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin the plot for first time readers. This issue isn't, of course, new. Genetic engineering of foodstuffs has been written about by, perhaps first, Harry Harrison, and there's nothing that beats Phillip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep for the genetic engineering of animals and people. But there's nothing like Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl. He takes up the entirety of the issue in a very new modern and contemporary context and thereby creates wonderful new characters and even creatures. There is also a deep moral to this that is thankfully found in the narrative itself rather than crudely tacked on as I've seen others do it. As to the exclusive, spoken introduction, Bacigalupi talks about what can be found in interviews on the internet:  how he went to Asia and had strange biologically scary boils erupt all over himself and, without money for health care or a better hotel than bascially a concrete box of a room, he simply suffered. And then wrote a mindboggling story about it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I looked at a few headset options for my Xbox 360S and the X41 seemed the most logical due to the simple optical audio hook up. The other headsets required a spaghetti maze of audio cables. The X41 is also wireless, with the exception of the talk back cable for Xbox Live gaming.<br /><br />I was skeptical about the 7.1 surround because I've tried other \\"solutions\\" in the past with mixed results. The X41 is quite different. I didn't really feel a difference initially when playing CoD MW2 or Medal of Honor. It was difficult to get a good position on some of the sounds because of the single player campaigns. However, when things start to slow down and focus on small arms combat, the X41 shines. I can hear if someone is moving behind me, or if a grenade drops behind me. The X41 also registers bullets that whiz by and give you a good idea of where it is coming from. More importantly, after logging several hours, I can start to pinpoint exact areas where the enemy is located based on the direction of the gunfire sounds.<br /><br />The microphone is very good at reproducing sounds, and with the X41 you can hear your voice through the headset. The chat volume is also independently adjustable from the game audio, and chat boost allows you to set a baseline chat volume, which then is amplified automatically based on game audio levels.<br /><br />The thing I really liked about the X41 is that I am able to get surround-quality sound without waking the neighbors at night, or using up half my office for the subwoofer and speakers. I have a 5.1 speaker setup for my PC and it takes up way too much real estate. The X41 immerses you into the game.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to install, uses two AAA batteries, everything is wireless except for the talk back cable<br /><br />Cons: Headband adjustment is quirky, tends to slip around a little, microphone boom is too flexible.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars, well worth the coin<br /><br />*************<br />UPDATE for 16 NOV 2010:<br />After using the X41 for about a month, there are some quirks of note. One is the battery life. The box says greater than 20 hours on alkaline AAA batteries. I call BS on this, because my higher capacity NiMH batteries only last on average 10-15 hours.<br /><br />There is also a constant hissing sound which will drive you batty. I am using the optical link, so it is all digital. I isolated as much interference as possible and the transceiver is only a few feet from my headset.<br /><br />The microphone boom is a little TOO flexible, but I haven't had any major complaints.

014241011X|4.0|I have always been a Roald Dahl fan so I bought this book for my kids. They are ages 3 and 4, so this book may be a bit long for them, but in the spirit of Halloween, I thought it was a great way to start a new routine: reading a chapter a night.     I haven't read this book since I was in elementary school, so I am having fun re-learning about REAL WITCHES. So far, each chapter has ended perfectly for a bedtime story, with the child saying good night to his grandmother and going to bed.     I gave this book 4 stars only because the illustrations could be less crude. Otherwise, this is a great book and my kids are having a ton of fun searching for REAL WITCHES - they even pulled my hair and made me take my shoes off to show them my toes.
1572814349|5.0|This is the most beautiful deck I have. The gold trim on the cards is just over the top amazing. In the case is the small book telling you what the cards mean. The box it comes in is sturdy and fits very nicely in a small space. I love that the box is small and long lasting. I love this deck, but there is some nudity in some of the cards, but with historic pictures comes nudity. If you are looking of a deck to have all to yourself this is the one.
B0041OOJNU|3.0|I am actually shocked that many people have already clambered up the \\"best album of Shakira's career\\" mountain, because while it is definitely better than her last one, She Wolf/Loba, it does not compare to her previous work. There are songs that stir up nostalgia, like 'Sale el sol,' 'Antes de las seis,' and 'Lo que m&aacute;s,' but as someone else mentioned already, the lyrics are not original as they once were. I admit that I am warming up to the CD, though I listened to it right before listening to Fijaci&oacute;n Oral, Vol. 1 and Sale el sol is inferior to it. I admit that the music is beautiful and her voice soars. While the CD is certainly a solid work, I listen to Shakira for her voice but also for her witty and wise lyrics. The ones that pleased me most are:<br /><br />-Antes de las seis<br />-Mariposas<br />-Devoci&oacute;n<br />-Tu boca<br /><br />The rest are decent. Anyway, if you are a Shaki fan, you will see by listening to the album that she really tried to make an album for those who have followed her throughout her career. It is a rebirth of the Shakira from the beginning.
038533348X|5.0|Before I say anything about the book, I have to say that I chose to read this book from a rather short list for a school project in Essay Writing.  That being said, I loved the book.<br /><br />Almost every single book that I have needed to read for school rubbed me the wrong way for one reason or another.  The most common is that it was too boring.  Cat's Cradle defies that and was instantly put near the top of my book list that I recommend to people.<br /><br />I was hooked after reading the first two chapters in the book, which for Cat's Cradle total four or five pages.  The chapter were amazingly short, some only a few pages in length.  To me, this made to book feel like it was going by really fast.  I read through the book in only a few days (books usually take me a few weeks in contrast).<br /><br />Vonnegut's use of sarcasm and satire is made me laugh out loud and question the stability of our government.  He dives into the tangled nature of science and religion and embeds doubt into the reader.<br /><br />I am a total science fiction and a science geek and when I heard from my teacher this had a sci-fi aspect, I jumped on it.  I am pleased with how the sci-fi part of the novel and the regular part of the novel are balanced and mixed with each other.<br /><br />Overall I rate this book very high, hence the five stars.  I recommend this book to everybody that I meet, even total strangers because of the awesome factor of the book.
0425238091|5.0|An excellent satire, especially for those who work in the medical field.  I work in the hospital and sometimes having to deal with the reality of dealing with the sick and traumatized can get depressing.  It's a must read to catch the lighter side as a release.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I've used several 3rd party ps3 controllers in the past and have always been disappointed.  This controller I bought because I was looking to get something to aid my XBox 360 friends when they come over to play.  ( I also secretly like the xbox 360 controller much more for comfort ).    The controller seems to be made of all good quality material, nothing feels or looks cheap.  The two \\"arms\\" on either side are covered in a mesh like plastic, which at first I thought was a negative, however it actually lets air flow a bit so it keeps your hands less sweaty and slippery.    There are a few noticable differences from the typical ps3 controller.  One is the mesh siding as said above, other then that, the two joysticks and L2/R2 are concave instead of convex ( like the xbox 360 ).  This is awesome as it makes it much easier to grip.  The whole controller also has a little red backlight for each of the buttons...which is nice.    The L2 and R2 also don't have to be pushed in as far for a whole push.  I would classify these buttons as a good in-between of the PS3 and Xbox design.    If you're an XBox player playing on a PS3 or simply prefer the XBox 360 controller, I would highly recommend this item.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Nominated for 6 Academy Awards, this 2009 film is as timely as today's headlines (or I should say last year's headlines).  It's set in the turbulent times of office layoffs during the recession. George Clooney is cast as the hatchet man and he really loves his job.  He travels all the time and doesn't even have his own apartment because he's always in the air.  He loves this life he leads which consists of airports, fancy hotels, and occasional one night stands. We see him in an amorous adventure with Vera Farmiga.  She's also a high-powered executive who flies all the time and they meet for torrid couplings whenever they can. Suddenly things change.  Technology has entered the business and his boss wants to make these formerly face-to-face firings through computer screens. He's hired a hotshot aggressive young woman, Anna Kendrick, to manage this.  Clooney complains against this but his boss sends the young woman on a trip with him to test out this new system.<br /><br />Naturally they are complications.  Some of them are the sad responses of the people being fired.  Another is how the presence of this young woman effects the relationship between Clooney and Famrmiga.  Some of this is outrageously funny and I found myself laughing out loud.  And other parts brought tears to my eyes as the people being fired watched their lives collapse.  And then there is Clooney's family, who is hosting a wedding for his niece.<br /><br />All of this seemed very real.  The film moves fast and includes trials and tribulations as well s some high comic moments.  And then, just when I thought I knew how the film would end, there was a real surprise zinger which changed everything.<br /><br />This is a really fine film.  Don't miss it!
B003UYV08E|5.0|This is a great movie and a great sequel. I'm now really wondering what iron Man 3 will be like.
0425238091|5.0|I found this book to be entirely believable, a mixture of black humor in the face of death and overwhelming stress and humanity in the face of dehumanizing circumstances. Sounds like it should refer to war, saying that, but it actually refers to a young doctor's first year of internship, set in the early 1970s.<br /><br /> I am not in the medical field, but from what I hear, it isn't much better today. The only thing that bothered me about the book is the pseudonym the author chose for the hospital and thus the book. He actually went to Harvard Medical School (which he calls BMS--Best Medical School) and interned at Beth Israel (which translates to House of Israel, not House of God) and for some reason that annoyed me.<br /><br />I guess I was also a bit bothered by the fact that he was able to take a year off and hang out in the south of France after his internship. But the facts of medicine as he practices it--mainly that in order to do no harm, in most cases you should do as little as possible, seems all too wise. The book runs a little long, but the writing is as sharp as hell.

The book was a first-hand account of basic training as well as the subsequent battles and island-hopping in the south Pacific.

Scientist have just begun studying what happens inside your brain cells when you exercise. This book will motivate you to get up off the couch and move! Aerobic movement can enhance your brain by increasing the growth of neurons leading to an improvement in cognition, attention, and focus and a decrease in anxiety, addictive behavior and depression. What builds the body will certainly build the brain. Once you read about what goes on in your brain during and after exercise, you will be heading to the gym.

First of all there's nothing wrong with the font, it's perfectly legible, and the books are nice and compact. There were many grammar errors in the book but I'm not sure if that's arthur conan doyle's fault and the publisher wanted to preserve the original copy or what.Also the inside blurb wasn't correct at all and is stating that arthur conan doyle killed off sherlock holmes in his last bow published in 1893? Nethertheless the stories are great but just think about buying a different edititon than this one.

B000002G6J|5.0|I bought this album back in 1970 because I liked the cover: a giraffe running through deep purple surf against a garnet sky--are you kidding me? All we needed was a naked blonde splashing about among the tide to make it complete. I had never even heard of AC Jobim, but this cover was too much for me. By the way, the present green sky/blue surf motif was computer generated--the original color photo was done with a red-tinted camera lens and was indeed purple and red. And I still like it better.     A few things I'd like to point out regarding this masterwork:    (1)Claus Ogerman deserves a lion's share of the credit for his subtle, relaxed and impeccable arrangements.    (2) This album did for me aurally what Playboy magazine did for me visually: it made a \\"bum\\" (according to my mother) like me feel like a martin-sipping yacht-club sophisticate. Man, did I feel sophisticated listening to this. And rich, of which I ain't either one. My lowlife friends who were into Led Zeppelin, Grand Funk (yes, I had friends like that then--GRF fans--just like I have friends who are Communists now) and the Who just weren't as hip and sophisticated as I was back in '70. Waiter! Another Tanqueray and tonic please!    (3)In these other reviews, I don't see any mention of Ogerman's \\"Secret Weapon\\"--the great Urbie Green. His smoo-ooo-th, buttery tone and beautiful timbre is another reason this LP is such an unqualified success.  If any other trombonist played these solos, the album wouldn't be nearly as good. His sound is pure velvet.    (4)What was side 2 on the original LP (cuts 6-10) is better than what was side 1 (cuts 1-5). As good as \\"side one\\" is, the tunes all seem to run together and lack true distinction, whereas every cut on \\"side two\\" sonded entirely different.    (5)Mojave is a beautifully evocative distillation of driving across the Mojave desert at dusk--something I did with my parents when I was five years old. This cut brings back memories of the sheer, stark and cool desert. (No, I didn't drive!)    (6)Dialogo--here's what this is all about: A couple have just made passionate love and are now laying in silk sheets in each other's arms, smoking cigarettes in dark brown paper (Mores?) and murmuring: \\"How was it for you?\\" \\"It was good for me, was it good for you\\" \\"Yes,it was good for me, too...how about a Tanqueray and tonic?\\" \\"I wuv ooo\\" \\"I wuv ooo, too...,etc.\\" That's what it's all about: a man (Romeo Penque--Christ, even the name sounds sophisticated--on bass flute) and woman (that Urbie Green again, although, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's a woman) are engaging in blissful, post-coital (God, I haven't heard that word in a while!) conversation. Listen to it and you'll see that it's true!    (7)During the first minute of Captain Bacardi, dig the way drummer Claudio Slon switches from Brazillian rhythm into 4/4 jazz rhythm. The subtle way he eases into the jazz rhythm after playing hot Brazillian beats is wonderful--this guy has a nice touch on drums--a joy to behold and the highlight of the entire track for me.    (8)There's an engineering error--extrememly rare in a Creed Taylor production--at the beginning of Green's trombone solo on Lamento. The tape was apparently stuck in the capistan roller for an instant, then suddenly came out, resulting in a cool-sounding noise, like \\"scrrritt\\" or \\"swoooop\\" or something like that, when the take-up onto the empty reel had pulled the excess tape. Watch (listen?) for this.    (9) BUY IT!

He stays awhile in Orlok's castle until the count makes the deal to make the house he is looking for, soon Thomas realizes that he is a Nosferatu or vampire as Orlok begans to spread terror on his way to Germany where he will seduce Thomas's wife.<br /><br />One of cinema's greatest treasures of all time! this is the movie that established vampire films forever since it's release in the 20's around the world. Originally director F.W. Murnau was gonna make a film based on Bram Stoker's Dracula novel but didn't get the rights until in the 30's Universal got the rights for their Dracula movie, so he decided to make a movie based on it by changing names and locations from the book to something different yet it worked perfectly. This is German expressionist cinema at it's best with \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\", it embodies what we see in vampires since then on film and even became the first ever bloodsucker movie. It truly made cinematic history with it's iconic vampire influencing everything from Buffy, Dracula, Salem's Lot, Blade, and many others to even a biography film of Max Shreck called \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\" which tells the story of how the film was made including on Max Shreck acting like a real life vampire.<br /><br />This 2-Disc special edition DVD contains both brilliantly remastered and re-orchestrated versions of this masterpiece such as the original German version with German intertitles with optional english subs to the newly translated English intertitles version with a beautiful high def transfer that looks amazing for a silent film plus the score in glorious brilliant remastering that sounds CD quality if you ask me. 2 lengthy documentaries, lenghy excerpts from other films by the director, photo gallery and scene comparison for this is a must have for horror films, vampire buffs and even cinema fanatics.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Bought this cd when it dropped (9/28/10) and haven't stopped listening to it since.  Each and every song on this new collaboration is worthy of being a single in it's own right.  Of course, the title song, World Gone Crazy, sounds and feels much like many of the Doobies songs from their early works, but even the softer ballads here (mostly sung by Pat) have that same quality.  I highly recommend purchasing this cd if you're a lover of the good rock music from the '70's, and ESPECIALLy if you're a Dobbie fan, whether you've been along for the entire 40+ year ride, or you've joined the band wagon somewhere along the way!  And the added bonus of the DVD is super and brings back many memories for those of us old enough to remember \\"the good old days!\\"
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|There are three reasons to see \\"Hereafter\\":    Clint Eastwood's ever-burgeoning genius as a director.    The ghoulish coincidence that, simultaneously with the movie's opening this past week, a volcanic eruption and ensuing tsunami wave killed 300 Indonesians, and left 20,000 homeless--an occurrence powerfully depicted in the film's opening minutes.    And the Number #1 reason is that \\"Hereafter\\" introduces to the world a great new talent and face.    Among those viewers possibly put off by the film is bound to be Catherine Deneuve.  For half a century, ever since her world-wide success in \\"Belle du Jour,\\" Deneuve has been \\"the official face of France.\\"  Literally--for her perfect but rather bland features have been the model for painted or sculpted allegorical representations inside all government buildings of \\"la belle France.\\"  But today, coincidental with the formidable Deneuve's puffy new look (she quit smoking), Mr. Eastwood is the first to show Americans the new face not only of France, or Europe--but the whole global community of strong, sensual, intelligent, and forthright youth.  This Face could belong to a beautiful female or to a beautiful male:  lips! cheekbones! a jawline as determined as Clint's!  This Face, conceived and born in itsy-bitsy Belgium, blows right off the big screen Hollywood's Blubbery-lipped Jolie or Aging, Crossed-eyed JR.  This fresh new Face belongs in the Valhalla inhabited by such cinematic beauties as Garbo, Lamarr, Dietrich, Hayworth, Taylor, Loren--or Grant, Power, Clift, Dean, Eastwood, Curtis, Newman, Olivier, O'Toole, Connery, rookie Cillian Murphy.  This newcomer, even after nearly drowning in a tsunami wave, is gorgeous! natural! luminously thrilling!  Oh, her name?  Oh, Jesus, this actress is saddled with a truly, TRULY awful name.  We can only hope that with increasing adulation she changes it to something more suitable, like  ..Esmeralda.. Nefertiti ... Beatrice ... Mata Hari.  Her name?  OK, ok, it's:    Cecile de France--and like Hercule Poirot, she not's French.  She's universal.

We will likely purchase subsequent books in the series for him to read.
030745455X|4.0|The late Mr. Larsson has done well in creating this sequel to the first Lisabeth Salander novel.<br />The characters are well developed, with his descriptions in the novel being precise. The main characters of Salander & Blomkvist almost jump from the pages. They are that well developed from this & the first book.<br />The ending to the book offers a few surprises. One stares Blomkvist & the reader in the face & we never realize it.<br />The book is a bit on the long side, but is very well written. One may find a couple of superfluous characters. It may help if you've read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" first. I think the first book moved along a bit better than the sequel. I found this bogs down a bit when Salander is not present in the story. She is an excellent main character

B003Z0D4S2|2.0|I found this book to be so wrapped up in fine detail, with so many plot lines running simultaneously, that it was almost impossible to maintain interest in it.  The first two thirds of the book was outright boring, the final third I would call acceptable.  My wife loved the first two, but could not make it past the first 150 pages.  I would not recommend its purchase.

Made a sandal wearer out of me.
0439023483|5.0|Oh my racing heart!  I now know why everything I've read about this book raves about it and tells you to make sure you have a period of time to devour this book start to finish.  I really don't know how I have managed to put it down the last couple of days!    The book is set in North America after a huge war which leaves the Capitol the victor and the districts the losers.  In the Capitol everything is peachy, but in the 12 districts, things are anything but.  Katniss is lucky that she and her friend Gale are able to hunt outside of the district lines without getting into too much trouble, since she provides meat for her family and other important families in her district.      The title of the book, The Hunger Games, comes from an event that is held every year.  Each child in a district, ages 12 - 18 has their name entered into a drawing that occurs before the games to select the male and female representative of their district.  Some, like Katniss, have their names in there multiple times, because once a month they can add their name to the drawing in order to get needed supplies for their families.  When her little sister, Prim, is chosen at her very first time of eligibility, Katniss immediately offers to take her place because she knows she has a much better chance of surviving than her sister.  The male chosen in this year's game is Peeta, the baker's son (and yes, this is important on more than one occasion.)    Once the kids are selected, they are taken to the Capitol to be prepared for the fight for their lives, literally.  The point of the games is to have one winner, the one who survives the longest.  I will say that there is killing in this book, some of it is brutal, but when it comes to survival, these young children have to make an extremely stressful decision: to kill or to be killed.      This book is a fast-paced riveting page-turner that will keep you guessing about the final outcome up until the last - so much so that I dreamed about the book last night (before I finished it)!  I can pretty much guarantee you that you will want more, but will find out that this is book one and I can tell you that book 2 isn't coming out until September 1st.  I, for one, can NOT wait!  (And if you're like me and tend to get impatient while waiting for sequel books to come out, read this one in August so you have less time to wait!)  The ending is good and solid, yet there is still a lot of information that we just don't get in the first book.  I am seriously chomping at the bit here, people!    Notes on the Cover:  I love the black.  It really hits home the point of the bleakness of the lives of the majority of the people in each district, also of the situation the Capitol forces on the people of the districts.  The gold mockingjay pin on the cover is beautiful.  I just know there is more to the story of this pin, but I just haven't totally figured it out yet, nor have I figured out why the person who gave it up did, and what their motivation was.  (In this book, it's all about the hidden objectives!)
B000127LW2|5.0|I am a Star Trek Fan - and a female - I love ST Voyager because of the female captain and the combination of characters. I wish they would make a movie.
0545310601|5.0|So you know that I was up way too late at night finishing this one, right?  I COULD NOT wait to see how it would end, and oh man, did this series end with a bang!  The sense of urgency, the not knowing who to trust, and the feeling of helplessness as Katniss healed and tried to do what was expected of her, but feeling that she wasn't the person she was supposed to be just kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire book.    I'm sure by now you realize that the battle is on, it's the Capitol versus the rebels, President Snow vs. the rebel leader (sorry, my mind is hazy at the moment), Katniss vs. Katniss.  Yes, that's right.  She's suffering from some serious PTSD, and it's exacerbated by the fact that President Snow has Peeta, and a feeling of being a pawn in something much larger than she had bargained for.  She wants to do what's right, what's expected of her, and yet be herself at the same time.  She's still a pawn in the game, but now the game is upped to that of trying to survive even amongst the `good' guys.    There are a lot of deaths in the book, and some shocking ones at that.  At one point, I literally uttered, \\"oh no s/he didn't!\\" to something that was done to emotionally hurt Katniss, more than anything that had been done to her physically.  And yes, she is physically hurt a lot in this one too. (I don't want to give it away, but oh, my heart broke for her).      Collins does give a nice wrap-up to what goes on after the war is over.  She even satisfies the whole, did she choose Peeta or Gale question.  I, for one had waffled on who she should choose, but felt that it was right when the choice was finally made.  I think that's what I truly wanted, but didn't want to ruin it for myself if she chose `wrong'.    Notes on the Cover:  I love these covers.  I think Collins completely lucked out with the fluency of the cover design on these books.  They're just spectacular.  The Mockingjay is finally free.
B002WCLG3Y|3.0|I enjoyed this DVD, even if it was a bit shorter than I'd have liked. The Halo Legends series, however, seems like something that would be enjoyed most by those who are enthusiastic Halo fans and particularly those who've read the books and looked into and discussed the mythos the game creators made.
0545310598|5.0|Do you remember The Hunger Games and how it the book ended?  Have you been waiting and waiting and waiting like I have for the sequel?  Well wait no more, as it's out and just as good, if not better, than the first book!<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are preparing to go on their Victory Tour of all the districts at the beginning of the book.  When Katniss comes home from hunting one day, the President of the Capitol is there waiting for her.  When he threatens her family and friends because he says she is causing an uprising, Katniss vows to do what it will take to protect them during the tour.<br /><br />Then comes news of the Quarter Quell.  It is celebrated every 25 years - and this year will be the third.  This is the Hunger Games, but with an added twist that blows everyone away, especially Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch.<br /><br />I really can't say anything more without giving too much away.  I will say that Katniss's Mockingjay pin figures prominently in this book.  Also, you will not be able to put it down.  Really.  I had to continue reading and skipped out on other things that I should have been doing (like homework...oops).  I even had to stay up past my bedtime to find out what happens (double oops).  Collins has a natural talent for putting you right there with Katniss and the way she creates suspense is just phenomenal.  And naturally, Collins leaves us with another humdinger of an ending.  At least she's working on the third book in the series!<br /><br />Notes on the Cover:<br />The red is very catching, and the Mockingjay pin again figures prominently on the cover.  I liked the choice of red before I read the book, but now it means so much more and I am in love with it.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|James Clavell writes magnificently. Not a single phrase in this book is boring, overused or unnecessary. With a 1000 pages to read you might think this book is enormous only to find out at the end that you could have read another 1000! The historical, political and military views have been thoroughly researched and are used brilliantly to portrait the old Japanese society.<br /><br />All characters have considerable depth and when following Blackthorn's journey in this new society, you can imagine yourself walking along in his footsteps and slowly understanding, as he does, what the Japanese culture is all about. Clavell spins the tale taking us back and forth in time and giving us the perspective of different people for any given situation. This might sound confusing or even boring but it takes a true master of storytelling to achieve this without those feelings creeping up. He manages this by keeping the story focused on the key characters and dedicating more time on their thoughts, feelings and memories rather than giving long descriptions of scenery and pointless accounts of unrelated facts. While it might surprise you how good the writing is from the start, the writer actually only unravels his full potential after 400 pages. By then you will be bound for a ride that you won't want to end.<br /><br />I would urge you to read this book. A true masterpiece and forever one of my favorites.
1453624910|5.0|The wonderful thing about Lynn Flewelling's fantasy Nightrunners series are her characters, specifically the leads, Seregil of Rhiminee and Alec of Iveywell. She wrote Luck in the Shadows back in 1996, and published the 5th book in the series, The White Road, this year.    It is easy for the reader to fall in love with Seregil and Alec, they are not always perfect yet affable, sincere, funny, exciting, great fighters.....and lovers. Only problem, we never got \\"see\\" their intimate moments. After many years of hearing from her fans, patient fans, Lynn wrote a series of short stories, Glimpses, with all those \\"behind closed doors\\" moments that were alluded to in the other books. She also teases the next book with a few pages of our two heroes in their element, playing cards, or rather, taking money from a noble!    This book has four short-stories (so I won't go into detailed spoiler territory)  that tell the back-story of Seregil's arrival in Skala, the momentous meeting of Alec's parents, how Micum and Seregil met, and the tender story of Seregil and Alec's first night as lovers. Lynn also included several pieces of fan art, which is a nice touch, and really heartfelt.     If you have and enjoyed the series, this book is a MUST have ...really. If you haven't read the series, then Glimpses will spur you on.     Please note: unlike the Nightrunner series books, the love between Seregil and Alec is finally and intimately realized, and there are a few other sex scenes, straight and gay. After all, that was what the fans wanted!!
B003L45JLW|5.0|The Blue Ray format is great.  As an audio engineer, it was refreshing to hear production that had not been squeezed down for radio.  Every song on this disc is great; it's hard to believe they did it all in one day.
0596806027|4.0|Is it too early to start adopting HTML5? Most likely yes.  Is it too early to start understanding HTML5? No, the sooner, the better.  Does the author spend too much time talking about video codecs? Yes, the discussion is too off-topic considering the book's goal.  Are there too many examples in the microdata chapter? Yes, and I don't understand why, a few pages in that chapter are just redundant.  Is Pilgrim an author you enjoy reading? Yes, definitely.  Is it worth picking this book to get a feeling of what HTML5 looks like? Sure, go for it, you will not regret.  Since specifications and browsers evolves, is this book going to be outdated? Not very soon, but later on it will.
0316154687|4.0|Sedaris is very funny and is able to find and relate humor in everyday circumstances.  He is not afraid to take on alcoholism, drug use and homosexuality (often in the same sentence).  I am looking forward to more of his works.
031603438X|4.0|It's hard to judge this book. When I was thirteen my sister and I gravitated from Elvis and Cliff to the Beatles and the Stones, buying every LP as it was released. Later at University Beggars Banquet was played more than anything. Many years later I played Exile on Main Street solid for ten years, so much I can hardly listen to it now.     So I can't be objective, its like reading a book by my cousin. It's very very frank about relationships, about drugs, about occasional violence. There's a lot of stuff about musical technique, just like Miles Davis's autobiography, which it reminds me of. I don't understand most of this not being a guitarist, but the feel of these sections is great. It makes you want to get out all your John Lee Hooker and Jimmy Reed records.     The section about Brian Jones is revealing. This is actually the first book about the Stones I have read, so in comparison with the general familiarity from newspaper stories and rumours I had this is great, and Richards has an aura of telling the truth, by and large I would mostly buy what he's saying. There is also a very moving section about Gram Parsons, who seems to have been one of his closest musical associates and friends.     Earlier, all the stuff about his family is fabulous. Its worth tracking down the full length version of the Andrew Marr interview on BBCi incidentally, where Marr and Keith say his childhood was Dickensian which was exactly what was going through my head when I was reading about his wonderful family. His mother and his maternal grandfather were something else.     Some of the stuff about about the early sixties blues scene echoes what you can read in, say, a Pete Townshend biography I've read. Incidentally, Richards has almost nothing to say about any of his contemporaries musically, except to some extent the Beatles. But mostly that's about how the Beatles were marketed and about the scene they created. No opinions are expressed about say Clapton, the Who, or Hendrix. Butthen Richards isn't into judging much, unless someone steps on his blue suede shoes (or gets to the cottage pie before he does - read the book).     Mostly the book is about the folks he meets as he navigates his way through life which was always a struggle for one reason or another until the end of the seventies when he emerges from heroin and then meets his current wife Patti.     And of course there's some fascinating stuff about Jagger. I started to skip a little towards the end as I am less interested in their later music. But this is great for Stones fans and also it's a fascinating social record. If you want to know about superstardom south London style go for it.
B003WTE886|4.0|In 2009, the world collectively hugged Taylor Swift as she stood speechless and watched Kanye West interrupt her acceptance speech. Her last record, 2008's Fearless, put Swift's heart on display and the results were so believable, so innocent that everyone from newscasters and reporters to fans and parents of fans assumed a protective role for the young star. Now 20 years old, Swift is still transitioning from a young, love struck girl into a woman, experienced in both love and heartbreak and just like Fearless, the lyrics of Speak Now read like her diary of the past two years.<br /><br />Taylor Swift has seen her popularity skyrocket in the past few years and with that new fame comes the increased publicity surrounding her private life. With the gossip mill churning out ties to John Mayer, Joe Jonas, and Taylor Lautner, it's often hard to find the facts amongst the fiction, but those searching for answers need not look further than Speak Now. Her new record puts her opinions concerning everything from her past romances to the Kanye situation on rather detailed display, often hiding behind a fairly transparent veil.<br /><br />The lead single and first track on the new record is \\"Mine.\\" Following a similar formula to her massive hit \\"You Belong with Me,\\" Swift does little to evolve her sound from Fearless, but the subject matter is noticeably more mature. The song structure and instrumentation stand closely to her previous successes, but engineer Chuck Ainlay, who also worked on Fearless, cleverly moves Swift even closer to the pop side of the spectrum while leaving just enough hints of country to maintain its Country Music Awards eligibility.<br /><br />One of the real highlights on the record is the emotional \\"Dear John.\\" Swift's voice may be digitally tuned, but her timbre and word emphasis are elegant as she sings about feeling used.<br /><br />The subject is assumed by many to be about her brief ties to John Mayer, but while nothing is confirmed in the lyrics, the music certainly seems to support this speculation. The slow, bluesy electric guitar hidden behind Swift's voice echoes Mayer's tone beautifully and for those reading between the lines, this could prove to be more than enough proof of the track's intentions. Nearing seven minutes in length, Swift takes her time with \\"Dear John,\\" saving her strongest points for the end; her voice finding strength in the words as the song passes by.<br /><br />Although Taylor Swift has had a rollercoaster ride in her personal life, her popularity has gone nowhere but up since Fearless hit the shelves. Speak Now may not take many chances, but it plays perfectly to her strengths. Many of her recent live performances have put the imperfections of her voice, hidden by record production on both Fearless and Speak Now, on display, but regardless of her vocal talents, Swift is a gifted wordsmith and in that respect, she keeps getting better.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Dear John\\"port this speculation.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|This movie begins at the end. Emily Rose [Jennifer Carpenter] is dead, and her priest, Father Moore [Tom Wilkinson] is in custory. Prosecuting him is devout church-goer Ethan Thomas [Scott Campbell]; defending him is hard-drinking, hard-working agnostic Erin Brunner [Laura Linney]. This juxtaposition of faith and doubt, and how each character is tested and forced to the brink of a crisis of belief makes for a engaging, suspenseful story. In addition, Jennifer Carpenter's acting, done with very little makeup and instead through incredible body and face control, is masterful.<br /><br />The Exorcism of Emily Rose could have been a four-star movie. What holds it back is two things--as interesting as the character's struggles are, they could have been more richly drawn. The result feels more like chess pieces moving about a board than people being tormented by their beliefs. Also, the medical aspects of the case are very poorly handled--the diagnosis of epilepsy is made without ruling out other likely causes, such as brain tumor, metabolic disorder. This may seem nit-picky, but anyone who remembers how medicine was used in the Exorcist will know that delving into this and the invasion of the body that it brings would make an effective foil to the demonic invasion. They could have gotten the medicine right and made a better movie.<br /><br />Still, very worth seeing, but don't set your expectations too high.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, chronicles John, a man searching for answers about the atomic bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Throughout the book John meets a variety of people from scientists to the children of the creator of the atomic bomb. Vonnegut pokes fun at aspects of human nature such as religion, greed, and sin all in a manner that will keep the reader laughing throughout the novel. Vonnegut makes accurate satirical comments about many groups and institutions that Americans follow blindly. For example, John claims he was once a Bokonon, and throughout the book he searches for the members of his karass. In the end, he finds Lionel Johnson, the final member of his karass and the creator of Bokononism, only to find out that Johnson thinks religion is a complete waste of time! Vonnegut's dry humor makes the decisions of humans seem almost idiotic and the ridiculous scenarios he creates cause the reader to truly question human nature. The use of ice-nine at the end of the book displayed the greedy nature of human beings to simply do whatever best suits them without worrying about the greater good of a population.    Cat's Cradle is definitely an interesting and fun read. It can be finished quickly and it definitely has a lot to enjoy. If you get the chance I would absolutely recommend reading this hilarious, satirical novel.

B003A03RRU|4.0|This is a fantastic anthology of sherlock holmes stories, in their published order. I just wanted to confirm that yes, there is a full clickable table of contents in this ebook - but when you use the GO TO command, it doesn't take you to it for some reason. If you 'GO TO BEGINNING', it takes you to the first page of the first story in the collection, instead of the cover page of the book. Just press Prev Page a couple times at the so-called 'beginning' of the ebook, and you will find that the full table of contents is there. 5 stars for the stories, but I'd give it a 4 star layout rating, because the contents can only be reached in this awkward manner. However, the contents are fully clickable, you can just highlight a story with the cursor cursor, and click to take you to that story, which is a good feature.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|Really tough to watch hours upon hours of mindless nonsense and then it ends with a fizzle. Reminds me of \\"Shock and Awe\\" when we all sat glue to hours of TV and watched, well NOTHING happen. Winds of War had more going on than this. With no real character development, substandard acting and chopped up storylines, most of the film is dribble that you must get through to watch the next battle. It was visually stunning and the battles were intense, however short and rare. I say skip it, you aren't missing anything.  And yes, BOB set a standard that others must put more effort into if they want to succeed.

Nothing new, really.... my imaginary Jamie and Claire were so much more vital and exciting.  As someone said, all the bearded males seemed to look alike - felt like I had to go through and label them.....If you are out of ideas with this series, then write a short conclusion so we know where everything ended up, and go on to a new venture.  Don't waste your authorship on such trivial stuff as the Exile, please.

0061353248|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone who is suspicious about the ubiquitous rationality of humans and \\"invisible hand.\\"<br /><br />Through numerous entertaining examples based on MBA students from top schools Daniel illustrates astonishing irrationality of the former, inevitably implying that results based on sample of group with lesser intelligence might be even more surprising.<br /><br />Or, in author's words: \\"We are all far less rational in our decision making than standard economic theory assumes. Our irrational behaviors are neither random nor senseless - they are systematic and predictable.  So wouldn't economics make a lot more sense if it were based on how people actually behave?\\"

March 2011 can't come soon enough, I haven't been this excited about a series since Harry Potter as a kid.  I read all 700 pages in 3 sittings I was so engrossed and they really flew by.
1416589473|4.0|This is a good book centered in the fictional world created by ArenaNet known as Tyria. While the writing in this book sometimes appears to be ill-considered or unedited at times, overall the story and the characters are well thought out and written with excellent detail - the characters are distinct and feel alive, which I think is really saying something considering how so much literature fails to accomplish this.     I'm glad I bought this book. I became a fan of the authors by reading it and sincerely hope that this book will have follow-ups.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for the most part.  A great deal of work was put into developing the characters and story until the very end.  It seems at the end as though the writer was just done with the book and ended it without the attention to detail include in the rest of the book.  I found myself feeling disappointed by the way it ended so abruptly.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|At last, we have a boxed set for the CHIC Organization.  As one their original fans, I have every vinyl and CD that exists of their recordings... until this release which gives us three unreleased Johnny Mathais tracks from 1981.  Thank you Niles and Rhino France for giving us this treasure.  Of course, I want more now!  How about Columbia releasing the Mathais/Chic produced album as well as we need the Soup for One soundtrack on CD.    In any event, this is worth purchasing if you want recordings of one of the greatest bands of all time.  Here's hoping CHIC will be recognized this year at last with an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Donna Summer.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|So, hard to believe but my husband actually started watching one of the episodes half way into the season and said it was pretty good. So...while were away over Christmas break I decided to DVR the entire series since they were re-airing it. Got back in January and we watched them all the first weekend we were home. Both of us are addicted...and we aren't youngins either...34 to be exact and can't get enough of this show.   Couldn't wait for season 2...it's even better if that's possible. Anyhow...great stuff, so much better than the Twilight movies. I actually think these actors would have played the Twilight roles so much better. Dobrev is such a better actress and more believable than K Stewart and how much hotter is Paul Wesley than Pattinson! All of them in the series are great, really! so much more emotion and depth.   Great show!!! My favorite!
B00003CXPJ|1.0|What a piece of junk. First of all, Ben Stiller is no director. He also can't act. He puts his mom, dad, and other assorted relatives in this \\"movie\\" if you can call it that. I call it junk. Absolute garbage.
0439023521|3.0|Pros<br /> - Great cliff hangers at each chapter ending kept me from putting it down.<br /> - IT's a decent quick read & I'll read book 2.<br /> - I love post-apocalyptic fiction.<br /><br />Cons<br /> - Too girly for my taste.  There's no place for fashion and shimmering dresses in a life and death struggle for survival.<br /> - I felt a serious disconnect half the time.  At times, the emotions of the characters and the actions of The Capitol were too illogical; I almost put it down.<br /> - The explanation the author gives for the purpose of the games was not sufficient to support the brutal cruelty.
B000W91RUG|5.0|What I like about the show is that the dialogue is written well:  rapid fire, lots of jokes, some obvious and predictable, some deeply thematic, some only a true geek would probably even get.  Even my kids love it (12, 14 yrs.)  The first season there was a little more play in the characters as they developed and its nice to see that.
B002ZG9788|1.0|What more can I say?  The original was pretty good.  The re-make is just dreary.
B003ZSI9YI|5.0|My first impression as I listened to the beginning of this cd- was \\"is this really phil?\\" He sounds different-not his usual style. However I can assure you-it really grows on you! It IS different! Phil Collins is taking us back to his youth (mine too actually) and revisiting it his way! The songs are great and so are his interpretations! Definitely a remarkable cd! I only wish he would tour again and \\"bring us back\\" on stage. Who knows-maybe he will!
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the film.  I'm not certain what I expected, but this seemed a little flat.  I suppose when you start out with a tsunami and drop down to private experiences with death, you go from shock to flat.  The only real highlight in the midst of it was the near miss with death of the surviving twin, Marcus.<br /><br />The acting was quite good.  I was especially impressed with Marcus, whose twin was killed in an accident, and his mother, whose personal problems had reduced the family to a shambles.  The acting here was intense and very real.<br /><br />In all, the film had the feeling of an assembly line process.  Everyone did their bit on their own home turf according to availability, and the featured actors met on common ground for the d&eacute;nouement.  No fuss, no muss, no bother.  Sometimes that works really well.  Richard Curtis, [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]], has used a similar format with great success. Given the renown and ability of the director and producer here (Eastwood and Spielburg), I expected more.  It just didn't work for me this time.

030745455X|5.0|This Novel is the center of the Trilogy by Stieg Larsson. It is the continuation of the tale started in the first\\" The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\",which should be read first. Both are now released as DVDs. Definitely in the category of a book you can't put down. This Swedish tale of intrigue and fast action is a must read. Even better is the \\"Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest \\" waiting to be read.
B00139W3NE|3.0|I have mixed opinions of this film.<br />It is both wonderful to look at but difficult to follow.  There are moments of sheer magic- like the talking animals, and moments of utter confusion- which are many.<br />The fantasy is a stunning visual collaboration and I love the concept of animal alter-egos, but I was bothered by the uneven story and distracting production oddities like the bobby pins in Ms. Kidman's hair and her bloodshot eyes. (Had no one on set ever heard of Visine?)<br /><br />Personally, I was disappointed as I didn't see any point to it and it seemed too open-ended, I guess for a sequel.  I have not read the book, but have noted reviews that say it is a polical allegory.  I'll have to take their word on that.<br /><br />I don't know if I recommend it or not; guess you'll have to decide for yourselves.

0439023521|3.0|This is an in-the-moment book that can be enjoyed as a page-turning thriller, but that can be easily discarded and forgotten after that. Seeing the overwhelming consumer reviews of this novel, I went in thinking that it would be something on the level of Ender's Game or The Giver or The City of Ember. While the book moves well, and the plot is constructed to keep you rolling along, The Hunger Games lacks the originality and genuine spirit of those other books. It's a book that seems to want to say something about the perils of reality TV or about a society that preys on children, but it never does so, and then it hooks the reader in the same way that cheap television does--by creating average characters with stereotypical traits and then making the reader more interested in what's next for the characters instead of keying in on the point or the themes of the story being told. And the reader's relationship to the characters does a lot to hide the fact that there isn't much point here. But that's why people like reality TV. It's fun to make fake friends and then watch them do things that we can't do. And this is a fun book that's even interesting at times, but mostly it's an empty diversion without heart--like a scripted season of Survivor.
030758660X|2.0|I don't like to leave negative reviews but I have to say that<br />1) I was really exited when I found out about this book<br />2) I was totally disappointed when I had a look at the patterns.<br /><br />The book has all the right wording to attract a vampire lover like myself however I do not feel that the look of the patterns and choice of yarns reflect what I expected vampires to look like. It is too 'run of the mill'.<br /><br />The patterns are nice enough, don't get me wrong, but not what I'd go for if I went for a vampire look. The photography is lovely but still not vampirish enough. A bolder statement in design is needed to really hit the vampire mark.<br /><br />So I am hoping that a 2/5 is not too harsh, just below the middle. But I was really disappointed when I flicked through the pages (online). I almost would have bought the book on the description. Brilliant copywriting!<br /><br />I'd like to be kept informed if there is ever an update on these patterns.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Jimi Hendrix, with his eratic and complex guitar style, has paved the way for music years after his departure. His whole sound and driving solos make his music unique and timeless. This cd is the next great step towards discovering the true artist behind Hendrix. With amazing redone versions of Stone Free and Fire plus an amazing rendition of Cream's Sunshine of Your Love. This is a glimpse at the direction Hendrix was heading before his death. An amazing sequel to Electric Ladyland.    Hendrix designed the psychedelic sound many bands today still follow:  MGMT  THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE  THE FLAMMING LIPS  ANIMAL COLLECTIVE  BECK  DEVENDRA BANHART    a great cd for any die hard hendrix fan like myself. And if your curious about the way the new hipsters are interpereting his music check out any of the above bands listed.

But when he trades in his lawyer narrator role for that of a small town newspaper editor, he really hit home with me.  This is a great book, perhaps the best book of my lifetime.  One review compared it to To Kill a Mockingbird.  That is fair and were Gregory Peck cast to play the hero in the movie, the story might be as memorable.  I am here because I recommended the book to a friend.  Reading the reviews, I realize that I have forgotten just enough that I can have that wonderful treasure of reading this book again, for the fourth time.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Apparently no one told these guys good music died in the 60's cause theyre still making it. Few bands manage to write songs that take your mind on a roller coaster ride of emotions. (Off the top of my head MGMT and THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE are among the few).   With their newest release ANIMAL COLLECTIVE drug u and drag u through a sunny field. The songs have a driving rythem with soft easy sounds overlaying each. The result is pleasent and happy and dizzying.    The album as a whole reminds me of MGMTs Congradualtions ablum. A different calm atmospheric take on psychadelic music.    Track 2, 3, 4 and 6 remind me very much of THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE. The leading synth beats of the steady drums. With the smooth atomospheric vocals dragging you away. (As in THE BASTARDS tracks: THE SURF, CALL OF THE DEAD and WAR FAMINE CONQUEST and DEATH)    If you like either THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE or MGMT you will absolutly love this album. A great buy!
184311819X|5.0|An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Are you an arbitrator?  Are you involved with global business?  Then do acquire `Singapore Arbitration Legislation'.  This is a practitioner's work of reference of special interest to those whose practice involves global business in which arbitration now plays an increasingly important role. In the light of Singapore's growing importance as a leading dispute resolution centre, you would do well to add this recent publication from Informa to your library.<br /><br />As an annotated text on arbitration legislation in Singapore, the book's considerable weight and authority in this specialist area is conferred by the towering reputation of Professor Robert Merkin, ably assisted by his colleague Johanna Hjalmarsson at the University of Southampton.<br /><br />One of the few academic references of its kind in this specialist area, the book will certainly familiarize you with the structure, not to mention the complexities of all aspects of arbitration practice in Singapore which operates two systems of arbitration law; one for international arbitrations, the other for domestic arbitrations.<br /><br />As the author points out, `the twin-track' not only boosts Singapore's status as a prominent dispute resolution centre, it is designed to provide reassurance -- indeed guarantees -- that agreements reached via arbitration will be honoured.<br />Also -- as Singapore has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Arbitration 1985, the book should be of interest not just to Singapore specialists, but to all arbitrators.<br /><br />Writing in the Foreword, V.K. Rajah, Judge of Appeal, Supreme Court of Singapore observes that `Singapore Arbitration Legislation' meets `the `pressing need for authoritative commentaries on the arbitration framework in Singapore consistent with Singapore's increasing prominence as a choice destination for arbitration....'<br /><br />The text provides any number of examples of both Singapore and comparative case law, with both the Singapore International Arbitration Act (IAA) and the Arbitration Act (AA) extensively yet succinctly annotated, as is the UNCITRAL Model Law.  The Rules of Court and the Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre are dealt with in Parts IV and V and there are extensive tables of cases and legislation, together with a detailed index.

B0037W68F4|5.0|MGMT do it again with a satisfying step into their world. Though the album doesnt have any jump out single like the previous cd (Oracular Spectacular), the album itself flows smoothly. Each song brings a livelyness to a spectacular play that MGMT composes throughout the disc. After an up and down rollar coaster ride of music the listener can finally come down with the soft acoustics of the last track (Congradulations). A must have for any fans of Beck, THE BASTARDS OF APOCALYPSE, Animal Collective, Arcade Fire or THE FLAMMING LIPS.     For all those highrollers check out this cd and any of the bands listed above. My recomendations go out for them all.
184661208X|5.0|NOT AN EASY TASK FOR ADVOCATES WHO NEED HELP WITH THEIR CASE FOR COSTS!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you are a practitioner advising or representing clients in Employment Tribunals as an advocate, this book will offer you enhanced insight over costs issues and the pointers we need to consider when making specific costs applications.<br /><br />Recently published as part of the distinguished  Employment Law Series from Jordan Publishing, `Costs in Employment Tribunals'  -- in a project unique of its kind to our knowledge -- examines over 100 hitherto unreported cases which together build up a picture of when costs are awarded and when they are not.<br /><br />The author team, consisting of two barristers and a solicitor, has set out to distil the way the costs rules in tribunals are implemented in tribunals up and down the country.  To do this, they have elicited the help of numerous barristers, solicitors and `a small handful of tribunal judges' from various locations in the UK who have provided copies of the written reasons for tribunal decisions, as well as, in some cases, transcripts.  These are summarized and commented upon in the book.  Gleaned from real cases, the results are certainly revealing and definitely instructive.<br /><br />The authors warn, of course that `even though in general, Employment Tribunals do not award costs, there are circumstances in which they may, or must do so, but if they do, the rules differ from those which apply in the courts'.  `In Employment Tribunals,' the authors add, `an award of costs is related to the conduct of the parties rather than to whether they win or lose.'<br /><br />That costs orders are the exception rather than the rule in Employment Tribunals stems from their nature and purpose.  Employment Tribunals were - and are-- as Sedley LJ has stated, `designed to be accessible to people without the need of lawyers... [therefore] losing does not ordinarily mean paying the other side's costs'.<br /><br />As costs orders are exceptional in Employment Tribunals and legal aid unobtainable, there is certainly a pressing need for employment law practitioners to acquire this eminently useful book.  The 13 chapters cover a wealth of information and comment in such areas as deposits, costs warnings, delays, postponements and adjournments, misconceived claims, dishonest allegations and vexatiousness, wasted costs orders and much more.<br /><br />The expected reference tools are in place, including tables of cases, statutes statutory instruments and useful index.  The Appendix presents Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2004, SI 2004/1861.  For the employment lawyer, the --tribunal judge or even the human resources consultant, this book should be required reading to help you advocate your best case for costs.costs'.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have a brand new Oppo BDP83 with a May firmware date.  The director's cut of the first installment does not play properly.  As several others have noted, about 1/10 of the actual picture is put into the entire letter box frame(so you're seeing just a very small part of the picture, stetched out).  The 1979 version plays fine, and both versions played OK on my Samsung UP5000.  Someone here noted started the extended edition from the scene selection menu so hopefully that's a workaround next time.    I contacted Oppo and they responded in less than 2 hours- on a Saturday.  Here's their workaround:    \\"Start either Alien or Aliens then select the Director's/Extended Cut when prompted.  After the director's introduction and during the 20th Century Fox logo, press the TOP MENU button.  At the Main Menu select Play then ENTER.    The aspect ratio should be correct.\\"    I tried it and it indeed works!!

B003Q6D27S|3.0|None of the Saw films have been able to capture the same atmosphere or effectiveness of the original film. The sequels weren't able to screw with your head or have a twist that was quite as big as the one in the 2004 film. Most of the sequels had a budget of around $10 million, but went on to gross over $50 million at the box office. It's no wonder that Jigsaw is the new face of horror and the Saw films are being called the modern version of Friday the 13th since the sequels hit every year around Halloween like clockwork. So now, here we are, the \\"final\\" installment in the franchise and it's being presented in 3-D. Unfortunately, Saw 3D leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The film honestly felt like it was just trap after trap after trap until we reached the finale. The traps were bigger and sure, they looked pretty great in 3-D, but they were happening to new characters; characters we didn't know or care about. It seemed like they tried to cram as many traps they could into an hour and a half to capitalize on the 3-D trend. On one hand, that isn't all bad. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably still enjoy the countless amount of traps (seriously, you won't be able to remember all of them after it ends). If the film was just another Saw sequel, these bigger traps and new characters would be fine. But this is labeled as the last film of the franchise and other than what's revealed in the final minutes of the film, nothing is answered or unanswered that wasn't revealed in Saw VI.<br /><br />The script seemed pretty horrid at times. Coincidentally, both examples are from the Detective Gibson character. So maybe just his dialogue was written terribly. At one point, Gibson calls Jill, \\"crazier than a sack full of cats.\\" Who says that? Even a crazy person who witnessed someone putting a bunch of cats in a bag would think that was lame. Later on in the film when Gibson is talking to Jill, he literally says the word, \\"crazy,\\" about every other word. This isn't the exact dialogue, but it went something like, \\"I knew you were crazy the moment I set my eyes on you, you crazy woman. You're crazy. Crazy. I knew you were crazy.\\" So hey, did you hear? Gibson thinks Jill is crazy. It was just very redundant, but many would use that word to describe the Saw films anyway.<br /><br />The biggest issue of the whole film is the lack of John Kramer. He literally has like two flashback scenes and an intro video. That's it. Sure, the man died four films ago and he's been surviving on flashbacks and memories ever since, but Tobin Bell doesn't deserve top billing if he's only in the film for five minutes. The highlights of the film mostly lie in the short amount of screen time Dr. Gordon gets. Cary Elwes' return to Saw was probably the biggest drawing point of the film. The problem is that when you bring a character back from a previous film, especially in the Saw films, you can probably guess what that person was brought back for. So the predictability was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />The ending itself actually made it feel like Saw 3D was a return to form or at least an attempt to get back to its roots, which sounds pretty good on paper but isn't once you see it on-screen. Unless Saw 8 actually winds up happening and continues on with mostly new characters, then the whole thing feels like nothing more than a huge tease.<br /><br />Saw 3D is not a satisfying conclusion to a horror franchise that has run the past seven years as it leaves too many unanswered questions to gratify hardcore fans, but is still fairly entertaining thanks to its endless amount of traps and return of Dr. Gordon. The film does seem to wrap up everything for the John Kramer character, but makes you wonder if the series is really done or if it was left open ended on purpose in case it does well at the box office for the seventh year in a row. At the end of the day, Saw 3D may be considered a pointless sequel that will either leave fans wanting a more definitive conclusion or wishing it never happened.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nathan Fillion plays the dashing Richard Castle in such a way that I always want to see more and more of this show.  I'm not wild about the woman who plays opposite him, but she did grow on me from one season to the next.  She was always just a little over the line into \\"mean\\" when she talked to and worked with Castle.  I think she's lightened up during the second season and has made the series even more enjoyable.  There are many humorous moments in what are sometimes very grisly murders.  The range of emotions I go through as a viewer keeps the show from ever becoming boring.  It's fun to see Castle interact with his family as well as the police professionals on the job.  I am often surprised by who the murderer is at the end, and like that it is not always predictable.  It's a well-written and well acted show that I hope goes for years and years to come.  As I love to read murder mysteries as well, the show plays to that by having a writer solve the mysteries as he gathers material from real life murders to write his own murder mysteries.

I want to show everyone my before and after photos so they can see the difference as well, but then they'd have to see my before photos and that's not going to happen!    I did the workouts daily, I measured myself in the beginning, took before photos, and ate pretty clean the whole way though. Although, I let myself have a few indulgences while I was traveling. Yes, I traveled for work for about 2 weeks during this DVD and I still had time to do this every day!! It's over before you know it because it's under a half hour in length!  Long story short, I wasn't trying to lose weight, just tone up, and I did both. I lost over 6 pounds and about an inch all over from each place I measured, except for my arms and quad area. My arms are still a work in progress, but I lost about half an inch there, and while my quads haven't changed in diameter, their shape has gotten so sexy! I can't even believe it! The best part is my love handles are practically gone! I would have done it all over again just for that result!    I can't recommend this DVD enough!!! I think it's great for beginners and I plan on doing it all over again with heavier weights and pushing myself even harder.    In 3 weeks, I'll be on a romantic trip in Hawaii. I'll be wearing a bikini for the first time since I was 13, and I won't be wearing any cover ups thanks to Jillian Michaels!!
B002VKE0XA|1.0|While this movie was extremely hyped as being the be all of scare movies, it was pretty much lacking any real scare factors, except the final scene. The entire movie is staged, with two mediocre actors walking around talking about a ghost or possible demonic entity being tied to the female character. Simple tricks, and some lighting was used to create those overly hyped scare scenes. I will not be wasting much more of my time on this review, because in the end it is left to you on deciding whether or not it is worth your time. If cheap thrills scare you then this may in fact be the film for you. As for me, I'll get my scares at HHN and will NOT be watching the second movie. Like the Blair Witch project, this was a waste of time.
142311339X|5.0|I decided to read the Percy Jackson series after I saw one of the first ads for the movie (which turned out to be probably one of the worst movies ever made, by the way) and loved it for its mix of action and humor!  This book continues in that tradition and is exciting and funny.  The characters are great, I was not sure if I would end up liking a new set of them or not, but they were very engaging.    If you enjoyed Percy Jackson, this book is a must!  You get a new storyline and get to meet characters from the first book along the way- and should meet even more in the next book!    The only bad thing about this series so far is that we have to wait until fall 2011 for the next one!  I already can't wait for its release.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|When I think of the Stones.....I think of this era. This is absolutely the Stones at their zenith. They sound great!!!! No giant stage...no fancy lights....no Mick running around, but rather dancing. This is the Stones doing what they do best at the height of their game. And Mick Taylor does NOT get the recognition he deserves. Even watching the concert footage, he seems like more of a studio musician than part of the band. No one's \\"jamming\\" with him. He's coming up with some beautiful licks here. Bravo Taylor!!! And Bravo to the rest of the band on showing us what the definition of \\"Rock and Roll\\" is.
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|I haven't listened to all of it yet, but what I have, the single is good, but just not stimulating listening any more. But because of his past, I buy every thing he ever does, anyway, so .... He has saturated us, the market, with this adult contemporary stuff. I really enjoyed Pilgrim, which critics generally trash, but I have to admit I don't even listen to any of his albums more than once, unless it's Cream, 461 Ocean Blvd, or my personal favorite, Slowhand. Songs like Motherless Children, Mainline Florida and The Core are unbeatable. These albums since Pilgrim seem all the same, and they're ok, but why not take a chance every other album? It seems he may be milking his fan base, which must be huge, and most of the comments seem to love or really like his current albums. Kudos to him for reinventing himself like no one else I can think of from his era, but it seems he could keep us all happy. 15 songs on current albums, certainly enough room to cover everything that people are asking from him. It makes me wonder where he's coming from, but I have and buy every album he has ever recorded, Bluesbreakers, Blind Faith (boring), Derek (best loud blues-rock album ever), B.B. King (fantastic), so it appears to me he is mailing it in at this point. This is no intellectual point of view, just a serious fan's opinions. Thanks to all who replied/reply.
B002BP0KYI|5.0|These songs grow on you like a fungus. I liked 2 songs right away, and wrote off the rest until a 1400 mile car trip across the south of the USA. This album is brilliant. If you didn't like it on the first listen, give the musicians you like a bit of room to be creative, and let them try something different from their last recording. Songs 3, 4, 5, 8, & 13 are great.

B003YNFYD8|5.0|This review also appies to [[ASIN:B003YNFYCO 1962-1966 (Red) Remastered]]    The Red and Blue albums, as these collections are affectionately known, were originally released in 1973 to combat the increasing number of bootleg collections on the market, such as the heavily advertised ALPHA OMEGA collection.  Although I'm a first-generation Beatlemaniac, I have always loved these collections because they present an excellent overview of the Fab Four's career, from Love Me Do to The Long and Winding Road.  While not all of my favorite Beatle songs are represented herein, the Fabs had so many great songs that it would be impossible to produce a definitive collection that would please everyone.  This set may have been a forerunner to all of those \\"The Essential...\\" collections that we see today.    I purchased the combined Red/Blue set from Amazon.ca for a slightly higher price (around $42); that set is a QVC exclusive in the States right now, but it may be available on other sites, including Amazon.com, later on.    Packaging of the two sets is much better than the 1993 CD issues; foldout digipaks replace the clamshell jewel boxes.  The booklets are really nice with a great essay by Bill Flanagan and lots of photos.  The version that I purchased combines the two sets in a nice slipcase.    The sound quality, using the 2009 remasters, is much better than it was in 1993, when the inferior 1987/88 masters were used.  My only disappointment is that the mono masters of Please Please Me and From Me to You were used, as was the case in 1993, instead of the stereo mixes that were issued on the original 1973 LPs.  Perhaps Apple wanted to release these versions to the general public, as they were previously available (the remastered versions) only on the pricey THE BEATLES IN MONO box set.    I'm surprised that Apple didn't upgrade BEATLES 1 for its 10th anniversary issue; perhaps they will.  These sets have all 27 tracks from 1, plus 27 more.    For new Beatle fans, these albumsare a perfect introduction to the group, and will leave them wanting more.  For the casual fan who just wants the big hits, this set is perfect.  But even for the rabid fan and collector, this set is a must-have.

B001E45XT4|3.0|I just got this nifty headset in the mail today and well....it has a very sleek design and it's padding is very very comfortable. The sound quality is great and the microphone doesn't get in the way at all with crystal clear output. Unfortunately, when I put this headset on, the curve of the headset itself impales into my cheekbones and the pressure of it is brutal. I've tried stretching it out a bit and extending it but, none of it works. I can barely go 10 minutes without succumbing to the \\"pain\\". I feel as though it's making my head flat as the curved grip is in fact too strong.  I personally do have an abnormally large cranium but, this headset disappoints me in comfort. The Halo 2 Audio 350 headset(I own) made also by Plantronics is much more comfy though flimsy.      Pros:  Great Sound Quality  Clear Microphone, doesn't get in the way  Soft padding      Cons:  Extremely tight and Uncomfortable  Not worth the money
0385523912|5.0|Demick has done a great service to readers around the world by her depiction of life in North Korea. This is not a book about North Korea's politics, history or economy. I imagine that there are better books out there on those topics. What Demick does brilliantly is to methodically describe the lives of six different North Koreans who defected to South Korea. Her information is based on interviews with the defectors and further research from other sources. It is clear that she used multiple sources to corroborate the information she obtained from her interviewees. By delving deep into the lives of her subjects, readers will develop a clear picture of life under North Korea's oppressive regime. Demick is not emotional about her subjects; she is fair, unbiased, and objective. This is particularly commendable given the hardships that the defectors endured which makes staying objective difficult. Ms. Demick is an outstanding journalist and author. Highly recommended.

0525951652|1.0|If you were one of those people who eagerly awaited the release of Ken Follett's Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy), you are in for a nasty surprise. This book (which is supposed to be the first in a trilogy) is nothing whatsoever like The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Follett's previous historical novels were highly entertaining. I read both of them in a few short days and enjoyed myself immensely.<br /><br />The annoying aspects of Fall of Giants are many. Follett bases his book on the most tired and silly prejudices about the nations he discusses. All Germans are \\"orderly\\", \\"well-organized\\", punctual, and prissy. All Russians are \\"surly\\", \\"primitive\\", \\"barbaric\\", \\"corrupt\\", violent, alcoholic criminals. All Russian women are, of course, drunken whores. The only marginally acceptable Russian is the character who is obsessed with moving to the US. All Austrians are effete, perverted, weak, hysterically aggressive, unreasonable idiots. The French are weepy and useless fools. The French women are also all whores, but at least they whore around while sober. And, of course, all Jews know and help each other, forming a sort of an international Jewish mafia. All British people are insanely promiscuous (don't ask.) The culmination of the British promiscuity is reflected in a scene where the sister of an English earl (sic!) gives a hand-job to a German attache in the opera-house behind the backs (literally) of her brother the earl, Lloyd George, and foreign dignitaries. To top it all, there are the saintly Americans who, after torturing themselves over it for hours, decide to send invading troops to Mexico in order to bring peace and democracy to the wayward Mexicans. To the Americans' huge surprise, Mexicans are not overjoyed about the invasion and fail to be grateful to their caring neighbors to the North.<br /><br />The way Follett panders to his American readers (whom he then proceeds to insult with the RIDICULOUS Kindle price) is so obsequious that it borders on disgusting. Unlike those nasty Europeans and tyrannical Mexicans, America (meaning, of course, the US) is \\"rich, busy, exciting, and free.\\" There is no anti-semitism (once again, this is taking place in 1914), workers have amazing working conditions, are rich, and enjoy running water and electricity at home. Of course, each worker has at least two rooms all to himself. (I guess, Upton Sinclair is not to be trusted in his accounts of the horrible living conditions of immigrant workers in the US at the turn of the century.) American women are not subjected. They are all independent, \\"free\\", and have exciting careers. I wonder what happened since 1914 to change all that. Possibly, an explanation will be forthcoming in the next two books in the trilogy. The only problems that exist in the godly America are caused by the surly, criminal, promiscuous immigrants who keep trying to take advantage of the saintly Americans.<br /><br />For some strange reason, Follett hates Russia to the extent where he stoops to egregious falsifications of Russian history.  He makes blanket accusation of mass pedophilia amongst the priests of the ROC, which is not sustained by any kind of historic evidence. The priests of the Russian Orthodox Church are not only allowed to marry, they are required to do so. This suggestion that the ROC priests molest their parishioners' children en masse is simply wrong.<br /><br />Follett also states that the ROC priests massively collaborated with the secret police during the tsarist regime. Such collaboration with the secret police did, in fact, take place. However, it happened during a completely different time period and under completely different circumstances. I'd never even heard of any suggestion that the priests of the Russian Empire collectively betrayed secrets told to them in confession to the tsar's secret police. This is a figment of Follett's unhealthy imagination.<br /><br />This tendency to collapse historic periods in Russia intoone huge mess is evident in many other aspects of Follett's novel. He doesn't seem to realize that serfdom (the Russian equivalent of slavery) was abolished in 1861. The nobles who owned peasants before serfdom was abolished did, indeed, torture, maim and kill their serfs almost indiscriminately and sometimes with no punishment. That, however, became impossible after 1861. At the turn of the XX century, the relationship between the nobles and the peasants, while still problematic, was in no way similar to the way it was in the pre-1861 era.<br /><br />Follett's annoying tendency to present all Russians as heartless, vile jerks really gets too much at times. There is a scene (that takes place in 1914) when a police officer assaults and tries to rape a young woman in the streets of St. Petersburg. The narrator makes a very weird statement about how \\"no Russian would address a peasant . . . courteously.\\" This is, of course, ridiculously wrong. There always were many people in Russia who would address anybody in a courteous way. Suggesting otherwise, is simply offensive.<br /><br />While the first half of the book is at least well-plotted, the second half of the novel is a choppy, disjointed mess of loosely connected and excruciatingly boring scenes.<br /><br />So if you boycotted the Kindle version of the book because of the crazy price, you have to know that you made the right decision in several respects. This book is a complete and total failure.aspects of Follett's novel. He doesn't seem to realize that serfdom (the Russian equivalent of slavery) was abolished in 1861.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I don't work in audio engineering and I'm not a well trained music listener (yet), but I bought these headphones anyway because I needed something really good to start with. I wasn't satisfied with in-the-ear and mass market consumer headphones mainly because of the sound quality and general discomfort after briefly using them. So I did extensive research and ultimately it came down to the Sony MDR-7506 headphones.<br /><br />The quality of sound and comfort is the best that I have experienced so far. Since these headphones are capable of near-complete representation of music, I was able to hear more nuances in music with these headphones compared to regular headphones aimed at consumers.<br /><br />From what other reviewers have said, the ear cups of these headphones may tear and wear out easily. I don't have this problem yet, but fortunately the earcups are replaceable. In the package there's a service card that lists all the replacement part numbers in case something breaks.<br /><br />More importantly, these are analog headphones, regardless of what the big print on the packaging says. Therefore, the quality of sound may vary depending on what hardware you connect the headphones to. However, that doesn't make these headphones inferior. In fact, all other competing professional audio headphones operate on an analog signal. You just have to pay attention to the impedance, which is measured in ohms. This particular model, the MDR-7506, has an impedance rating of 63 ohms at 1 kHz, which happens to be adequate for most computers and audio equipment. But if you want to maximize audio quality even further, you have to connect these headphones into a standalone \\"headphone amplifier\\" or a similar device that enhances the analog signal strength. This is not necessary for most people, because the audio quality will most likely be already hi-fi on your hardware. But in rare circumstances or in the recording studio, it may be necessary.<br /><br />These headphones are NOT limited to audio engineers / professional use. They are equally appropriate to amateurs who want to embrace active music listening as well as learning technical stuff. I recommend these headphones to anyone who wants to actively listen to hi-fi music.
B002WY65VU|4.0|This film is not classic horror.  It's also not classic comedy.  \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is the model for films that are servicable as both horror and comedy.  Regardless, I like this film.  I wouldn't make it a Halloween staple but it is an engaging movie.  I would recommend this film to people(like my wife) who don't like horror films.  The humor here leavens the scares to guarantee that you may sporadically jump out your seat but you won't be sleeping with the lights on or avoiding going to the bathroom.  If anything it's a nice vehicle for some up-and-coming stars notably Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone.  Haven't seen them in \\"The Social Network\\" and \\"Easy A\\" yet but I'm looking forward to seeing them.  Woody Harrelson adds some veteran prescence to the proceedings and in an extended cameo Bill Murray is a hoot.  For a zombie comedy this one goes down real easy like a deep fried twinkie.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I am big fan of Batman comics and have been following story for a while now. This movie was unlike anything I expected. While other Batman animated movies have been decent, I was expecting this to be similar and nothing more than a rental. However, after watching it, it just made me go WOW.    PROS.    STORY (NO SPOILERS): As you know in DC comics, story has come up to the point that Batman is on his third Robin. This story takes place between Second and Third robin. It is about identity of a masked man that is amazingly almost as skilled as Batman himself. In this journey, Batman will encounter quite a few familiar and not so familiar faces. If you are a follower of Batman, YOU WILL LOVE THE SUSPENSE IN THE STORY.    ANIMATION: No need to speak here. Will make you go WOW as before.    ACTION: Unlike some of the previous batman animated films, it had a great deal of action. Special thing to note was action and choreography were simply spectacular. Batman using his gadgets to save himself from the fall, using hidden C4 on enemies in a manner they don't see coming and action of such matter looked quite natural truly fantastic.    CONS.    The only con. I found in this movie was to save this film from ESRB system, they had very little blood in it. While blood and gore don't make a good movie, but if someone were to be blown by tons of TNT, I would at least expect them to be burned or bleed little. But for some strange reason they don't. Oh well, I am presuming most who are going to watch this movie are gonna be kids. So works for them.    CONCLUSION:    To Batman fans, I would say this is a MUST BUY. But at very least, at least give it a rent. I was quite surprised by the story and animation and I am pretty sure, so will you.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I approached this one with real trepidition recalling what a lame flick \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" was.  For the first half of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" I was about to relegate it to the junk heap.  Nothing of anything was really happening.  The genius of the film is how it builds tension and claustrophobia until it ultimately grips you and by the end it has a visceral impact on you.  It layman's terms it scares the bejesus out of you.  Roger Corman would be proud of this terrific exercise that even he, the master of the shoestring budget, would marvel at how the makers of this film did with little resources.  I'm not so much reminded of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" but a student film by effects wizard Dennis Muren, \\"Equinox\\", made in the Sixties with little more than it's auteur's ingenuity.  \\"Equinox\\", a model for the DIY sensibility, has been given a first rate treatment by Criterion.  Certainly not a horror classic but a marvel nonetheless.

Love the American country twang and lack of filth in the lyrics.  Uplifting.<br /><br />Some may criticize the move away from solid country music to a pop rock format, but that's pop for you.  Maybe a little like Lady Antebellum gaining a larger market share?  Will the twang ever disappear from Nashville or Swift?  Let's hope not.<br /><br />Mine - very catchy.<br />Sparks Fly - a fave fans wanted to see this recorded in an album. Country twang.<br />Back To December - caught in my head again.<br />Speak Now - title song, interesting story behind this.<br />Dear John - good riddance, John.<br />Mean - country twang, catchy.<br />The Story of Us - cute kid tale of growing pains.<br />Never Grow Up - absolutely.<br />Enchanted - very catchy tune, lovely story.<br />Better Than Revenge - cute kid stuff, makes you recall your youth. (Can you always get what you want?)<br />Innocent - catchy ballad like.<br />Haunted - Evanescence-reminiscent.<br />Last Kiss - pretty, tearsome ballad, another single hit?<br />Long Live - catchy, nice beat.  Finisimo!<br /><br />I saw Swift on SNL and loved it and became a fan.  Very huggable.<br /><br />I'm sure fans will want to hear what she comes up with next, but we should take our time growing up and enjoy it!<br /><br />All things cute must live on.

B003Q6D27S|5.0|SAW 3D: The Final Chapter (SAW 7). Rated &#34;R&#34;. Running Time: One hour, 30 mins.<br />Directed by Kevin Greutert. Written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan.<br />Seventh movie in the series.  Filmed Digitally.<br /><br />Returning: Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor (SAW 3,4,5,6), Betsy Russell (SAW 3,4,5,6,) Cary Elwes (SAW 2004), Ned Bellamy (SAW 2004), James Van Patten (SAW 4,6,), Kevin Rushton (SAW 4), Greg Bryk (SAW 5), Tanedra Howard (SAW 6), Shauna MacDonald (SAW 6), Larissa Gomes (SAW 6), Janelle Hutchison (SAW 6).<br /><br />  When we last left SAW VI (2009), Jill (Betsy Russell) had opened the mystery box (SAW V [2008]) left to her in inheritance by Jigsaw John (Tobin Bell). She followed the instructions and found Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and then put him in a face trap. Jill made her getaway. Hoffman was able to get out of the trap. Bleeding and in excruciating pain, Hoffman screams out.<br /> What a cliff-hanger!  We eagerly awaited SAW 7 titled &#34;SAW 3D: The Final Chapter&#34; for 2010.<br />Since SAW VI (2009) did not do very well, they decided to combine 3 proposed SAW movies into one last movie (until 2017), thus calling it SAW 3D: The Final Chapter.<br />  I prefer to call it &#34;SAW VII 3D&#34;. Eliminating the &#34;VII&#34; or &#34;7&#34; from the title is going to confuse people not following the series now, but wish to buy them on DVD and watch them in the correct order.<br /><br />  We are taken back to the first SAW (2004), where we see one of the men has cut his foot off to escape. He drags himself down the hallway, stops at a hot, steamy pipe on the wall and deliberately burns the open end of his amputated leg.<br />  The game continues as we see Hoffman taking care of his ripped-off facial wounds and stitched himself up.  You know he is going to go after Jill.<br />  What has become a tradition in the SAW movie series, is the first trap. This new trap is very differently done than any trap we have seen. The trap is not inside, but outside in a metropolitan city in the business district. It involves 2 men (Jon Cor, Sebastian Pigott) and one woman (Anne Lee Greene). They are trapped in a window shop display case at Metro Hall in Toronto. They are seen by a gathering audience outside as they watch in horror.<br />  We are also introduced to another survivor of John's traps. We have not seen him before. Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) is making the TV circuit with a published book about his ordeal and he is helping other survivors.<br /><br />  That's the beginning of this seventh SAW movie and I will not tell you the Grand Finale. It was the last movie until 2017.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Chad Donella, Laurence Anthony, Christine Simpson, Rebecca Marshall, Naomi Snieckus, Chester Bennington, Dru Viergever, Kevin McGarry, Benjamin Clost, Gabby West, Kim Schraner, Olunike Adeliyi, Gina Holden, Carlos Diaz, Joanna Douglas, Elizabeth Rowin, Dean Armstrong.<br /><br />Filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.<br /><br />The SAW franchise is now in the Guinness Book of World Records. [[ASIN:190499458X Guinness World Records 2011]] as being the Most Successful Horror Film Series.<br /><br />My thoughts: I enjoy the SAW movie series with Tobin Bell and Costas Mandylor. Lionsgate has been cranking them out solid every year for October since 2004. They need a break.  The SAW movie franchise is a &#34;cash cow&#34; (moo moo) for the actors and everyone connected with Lionsgate and the SAW movies.<br />  I like the good mystery, suspense, gore, plot twists and the traps they invent. I thought SAW II (2005) was the best and SAW III made it even better. Bringing back Donnie Wahlberg for SAW IV was a great idea and allowing Costas Mandylor to continue his role as &#34;Hoffman&#34; since SAW III has keep the drama going. The continuous scene between John and Hoffman in SAW V (without breaking it up) was the best tension-builder of all the films.

031603438X|5.0|A most satisfying autobiography--if one has any interest in the Rolling Stones in general and Keith Richards in particular.<br /><br />The book begins with a description of the 1975 tour and with the carelessness of Richards and colleagues as they drove to the next concert in the south of the United States. I saw two concerts in Buffalo, NY during this tour, so I was intrigued by this examination of Richards' foolishness in the south. But his description of the event is disarming and a nice start to the book.<br /><br />The next chapter, on his childhood in Dartford is quite poignant and even insightful, as he describes his youth. We get a sense that Richards is not just the tough hombre that many see in his public persona. We also read of his early relationship with Mick Jagger (and their later sparkiness is well described in later chapters, too).<br /><br />Then, his effort at developing a career in art, his early interest in music, how he and the other Stones (including Ian Stewart and precursors to the final lineup) began, suffered, and slowly became players in the rock and roll community (the roles of Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts are told nicely).<br /><br />There is certain honesty in the early chapters, including his discussion of rather innocent relationships with young female admirers, when we often think of the Rolling Stones as predators of females. . . .<br /><br />And the beat goes on, as he describes the arc of his life and the career of the Rolling Stones. The ups, the downs. . . . There are some nice photos included. There is a pretty rough honesty to the book, with Richards telling things as he sees them. His comments about his relationship with Mick Jagger in the maturity of their careers are telling. One example (Page 457): \\"I used to love to hang out with Mick, but I haven't gone to his dressing room in, I don't think, twenty years. Sometimes, I miss my friend. Where the hell did he go?\\" And then the poignancy (Page 457): \\"\\". . .I can guarantee he'll be there for me, as I would for him, because that's beyond any contention.\\"<br /><br />If the reader has an interest in the band and its members, this is an honest and raw account that ends up being curiously compelling.e'll be there for me, as I would for him, because that's beyond any contention.\\"<br /><br />If the reader has an interest in the band and its members, this is an honest and raw account that ends up being curiously compelling.

0385505833|4.0|I think the real Ba-Humbugs are the negative reviews about this story! Perhaps the publisher's hype of it being the next Christmas Carol are slightly off the mark, but what is wrong with a book dealing with the angst of celebrating the holidays?  No one is murdered except the Krank's Frosty (and even that is accidental) so there is no need for courtroom drama. So what! And of course it will not be submitted for a Pulitizer either, but the story deals with what many Americans in our super-sized, over-the-top, commercialization of Christmas deal with every year. As Grisham states in the voice of Luther, lots of stuff has been heaped on the birth of Christ!<br /><br />Poor Luther is just trying to cope fact that the absence of his daughter during the holiday season will be upsetting to his wife Nora, save some money, finally get more than five days off for a vacation and forgo some of the overboard trappings of celebrating Christmas.<br /><br />He might seem cranky when dealing with the mulitude requests of trees, calendars, office parties, useless gifts both given and received, zealous neighbors and a doubtful wife but there is no sympathy for a guy trying to divest himself of \\"too much\\" except the lonely, hen-pecked fellow office worker.  Only if Luther professes to be Jewish or Buddist will anyone consider giving him some slack!<br /><br />Luther is just the basic everyday person trying to make some sense out of an overblown celebration, while still remaining the caring, generous guy his wife, daughter and neighbors love.<br /><br />Yes, maybe it's another \\"Hallmark-esque\\" story based on the need for mankind to find \\"peace on earth, and good will toward man\\" but still a great read!
B00138KBTS|5.0|To cut to the chase this is one of the greatest concert albums ever. So many people have mentioned this in the other reviews that I wouldn't even bother to review this record except for one thing.  That is the one negative review of the Autumn Leaves cut.  I realize that different people have different tastes but that review ignores one of the greatest strengths of Garner and this album: the dynamic, rhythmic and melodic contrasts in many pieces.  Autumn Leaves is all about these contrasts. I would guess that the person who didn't like Autumn Leaves did so because of the overly florid almost cliched passages in it.  However to my ear the important thing is the contrast between those passages and the softer, simpler and rhythmically different passages that follow each florid one. It is in this contrast that the wit and wonder of Erroll Garner is present. Much of this same creativity, invention, and subtle play is what makes this album great.  It is a joyous album whose subtlety is ironically often overlooked because of its obvious strengths. The more you listen to this album the more you will hear in it.

B003XOAJ6K|5.0|This is one of my favorite Duran Duran albums. The sound quality is superior; turn it up very very loud especially on those dance tracks; and hear every elaborate detail in it's carefully textured crafted tunes.  For those die hard Duran Duran fans this is an absolute must have!! This release features packaging / artwork & liner notes utlizing different pics not seen on previous releases. It also comes w/ a poster print of the band- not included in previous issues. The Concert DVD is worth the 30bucks easily; it's a great value considering you get the Remastered CD w/ the \\"right\\" version of \\"Drug\\" (see liner notes for details,) the Remixes CD, Artwork, and the Live DVD!
B0012OVF2U|5.0|Being a neophyte at writing record reviews, please take into account that what I have to say may not agree with your opinion, rather they are my estimations of Duffy's record, \\"Rockferry.\\"  Let me start off by saying that, until recently, I had never heard of Duffy.  In my car, I always have a CD playing (most likely Jackson Browne), and I don't listen to the radio; however, one day I had my husband's car, where he doesn't store any CDs because he always listens to sports radio, so I had no choice but to listen to a music station on his car's radio.  A song was playing that was really \\"catchy,\\" and I liked it a lot.  The station never acknowledged the title of the song or the singer, so I tried to remember as many of the lyrics as possible and Googled them when I arrived home.  It turned out to be Duffy singing, \\"Mercy.\\"  I went to Amazon to find the record on which \\"Mercy\\" had been recorded (it was \\"Rockferry\\").  I sampled all of the songs on the record and immediately ordered it, anxiously awaiting its arrival so that I could listen to the full versions of the cuts.  What I heard was amazing.  A unique voice, certainly something I would not consider \\"pure,\\" but, relative to the song's message, it ranged from soulful, to complete with anguish, to powerful, to tormented, and at times, empowered.  Again, depending on a specific song, she can be reminiscent (as has been mentioned), of Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick, Sandie Shaw or Lulu, but she strikes me more like Stevie Nicks, Jackie DeShannon, and even Alicia Keyes.  This is not to take anything away from Duffy's own greatness, but if you want my objective perspective of what to expect, Duffy retains many of the fine aspects of the aforementioned singers.  Even more comparatively striking, though, are the production and arrangement similarities.  For example, every time I hear the first notes of \\"Stepping Stone,\\" I expect to hear Dionne Warwick chime in with \\"Walk on By.\\"  I also wonder if there is an actual \\"Warwick Avenue,\\" or if it is an insider's joke referring to Dionne, one of the earlier famous, recognizable and acclaimed female voices of her day.  Again, this is not a criticism of plagiarism on the part of Duffy or Steve Booker, but more of a tribute to those maestros, Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  But back to the record . . . it is so infectious that I haven't stopped playing it for days, except for an occasional interruption to listen to some Jackson Browne.  I would love for them to do a duet, because he has worked before with Bonnie Raitt, and Duffy's voice possesses some of that same \\"cat scratching\\" quality that we take pleasure in hearing from Bonnie.  Obvious I am approvingly biased about some cuts more than others - \\"Rockferry,\\" \\"Warwick Avenue,\\" \\"Stepping Stone\\" (which is my favorite), \\"Hanging on Too Long,\\" and of course the song that started it all, \\"Mercy,\\" which currently is playing on my sound system and I'm having difficulty staying at the computer because all you want to do is dance when you hear this song.  \\"Serious\\" is a little too inane for me, i.e., arm/charm; suits/suede boots; expense/friends; play/everyday (although I do like the song's message and it certainly is not too insipid to fast forward).  \\"Syrup & Honey\\" is just not my cup of tea (no pun intended).  I'm just not into jazz, but again, I still listen to it.  The remaining songs, \\"Delayed Devotion,\\" \\"I'm Scared,\\" and \\"Distant Dreamer\\" all are worthy enough to be recognized as respectable.  Bottom line . . . sample the record on-line, and if your reaction is the same as mine was, you'll order it asap.  Look - Everyone isn't going to love it like I did - my husband doesn't care for her at all.  But then again, I can't stand listening to his sporting events on the car radio.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|The people who don't like the last new albums of Shakira, obviously should only listen to Donde Estan Los Ladrones or Pies Descalzos. Every artist needs to change and explore, other wise their music would get boring.  The lyrics are strong and her voice stronger, you can tell Shakira kicked her voice to the maximum. The only bad thing is the covers, but Shakira made it sound awesome.  My favorite songs are   Antes de las seis  LO que mas  Devocion   tu boca   and   Rabiosa    Love the album, great combination and it sounds great.  in many places its #! in sells and is barely  week   so that speaks for itself.      O yea and she collaborates with 4 different male singers/rappers:  Pitbull  EL Cata  Rene from Calle 13  and Dizzee Rascal
B00030DEQE|4.0|I had been using the onboard LAN and it was getting somewhat slow.<br />I had read that this card was pretty decent, but some said it wouldn't<br />work for W7Pro-64. Well it does. I loaded a Vista 64 driver for this<br />card, disabled the onboard LAN in BIOS, and it was picked up as soon<br />as unit was completely booted. It does come with an installation CD<br />from Intel, but the Vista driver for 64 bit seemed to do the trick.<br /><br />It is faster. I can tell and I'm liking that part of it very much. I<br />use Ver*zon DSL at 768 or whatever the transfer is and that's good enough<br />for me. I DON'T care for the price in comparison to the speed of transfer<br />I picked up, but that is not Amazon's fault, that's all about Intel's wallet.<br /><br />It's ok, and I would of given it a 5 star, but the price being what it is<br />and what I getting out of it.....it only rates 4, though I do admit if I<br />had a faster transfer rate it would probably be a much more satisfying<br />add-on and DO recommended it for anyone who wants a half way decent<br />card.<br /><br />Amazon as usual, handled my order with the professionalism I'm accustomed<br />to, that's why I'm a return customer.
B003VS0CWO|3.0|The picture quality is marginally better on the BD.    The audio is superb.    But where the hell is the audience participation track from the DVD?

B0018RWMNM|5.0|Lonesome Dove is one of those movies your friends, family and curious on-lookers will ask to borrow and then never return. So you end up purchasing it over and over....the same goes for the book.  The movie follows the book better than most movies do.  After you watch the movie, watch it again within a week.  You will be hooked and will watch it as much as , say a fan of Groundhog Day watches that movie.  The dialogue in the book is so fantastic, the words are not changed in the movie to \\"make more impact\\".  It doesn't matter this movie is a western, it's so well made and well-acted, it could have been any genre.  It's Duvall's best performance ever.  I recommend it for male, female, children (children have a more vivid thought processs than adults). It will make a positive impact on 99.9% of those who view it.  Just keep some money in reserve for future purchases, or don't ever lend it to others (that's hard because you'll want to share).

I became hooked and listened to his music constantly. His voice is so soothing and perfect.

I just hoped for more tracks on the album, or maybe even a DVD with live shows.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|\\"Dexter: The Fourth Season\\" came in last week. I wanted to watch one episode at a time, but sooner than one per week as TV viewers must do to get their fix of Dexter. I lost. I watched the four-set DVD series in two days. That's how enticing/intriguing/thrilling/demanding the series is. The viewer HAS to know what happens next.<br /><br />Anyone reading reviews of any season of Dexter knows how fanatic Dexter's fans are. The episode in Season Four which ends with a car crash was just about the cruelest cut of all for those fans! Who in their sane mind (among Dexter fans) could live an entire week not knowing what happens next? So, of course, I hit the play button. Had to know!!<br /><br />And good ol' Frank Lundy, the FBI-serial-killer hunter returns to this season and adds such a rich dimension to the story. The episode which ends with Lundy and Deb (Dexter's sister) forces another must-know, must-watch next episode. From that point on, NOT watching the series was no longer an option. So we had a Dexter marathon at my house in those two days. I even dreamed about Dexter (the series, not the man--although, let it be said, Michael C. Hall is an attractive man).<br /><br />A prominent feature of this fourth season is Dexter's devoted wife. However, with the advent of a crying baby, she develops into a control freak--or perhaps this trait of control has always been present, providing proof positive that Dexter loves this woman and his family, that he is, indeed, connected despite his Dark Passenger, Perhaps with time he can boot DP, but, of course, the season finale precludes any such event. In fact, the finale perhaps foreshadows a partner in some future day. After all, many serial killers are successful for years and years.<br /><br />Thus enters Arthur (John Lithgow), hiding behind the schoolteacher/deacon facade. Other reviewers strongly praise Lithgow's performance. I will, as well, but won't single him out. He joins a cast of equally powerful actors portraying equally evil killers. He does skilfully portray the chameleon facade of the psychopathic killer, even showing us the origin and root cause of his behavior. Unlike Dexter, Arthur does not have a benevolent father instructing him in ways of discovery avoidance. In fact, his drunken, destructive, abusive father pounds Arthur literally and figuratively into the makings of a serial killer.<br /><br />The season finale is catastrophic and so unexpected, showing that history CAN repeat itself. I'm thinking maybe I will add Showtime to my television programming. I'm not sure I want to wait another year just to get the entire season in one package. Maybe the serial wait is not so bad.ilfully portray the chameleon facade of the psychopathic killer, even showing us the origin and root cause of his behavior.

0061743526|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those novels which feels intensely personal to a lot of people, and it's one of those books which is such a staple of American culture that I can't imagine a time when I wasn't at least familiar with the film.  I think I've been steeped in To Kill A Mockingbird my entire life.    The novel is about the lawyer Atticus's struggle in the South to defend a black man who is charged with the rape of a white girl, and who is presumed guilty until proven innocent due to his race.  The narrative is told from the perspectives of Atticus' two young children, Scout and Jem.  The trial scenes in the novel are some of the most powerful scenes you will ever read, and the novel really is a wonder--particularly for the time in which Harper Lee was writing.    To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the most engaging, interesting, thought-provoking novels in American history, uses some of the most stunning examples of imagery I have ever seen, and one of the most well-sustained plots I have ever read.  There is never a dull moment in the novel, and just when one is afraid that the novel will peter off into an anticlimactic finale, Lee brings the novel to an extraordinarily satisfying ending.  I challenge anybody to read To Kill A Mockingbird and not come away wanting to tell everyone you know about it.

0451216725|3.0|Code to Zero is the latest from bestselling author, Ken Follett, who has brought us such greats as The Eye of the Needle and The Pillars of the Earth.  Code to Zero involves the violent competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in the race to get rockets and manned spacecraft up into space.  The year is 1958, the Soviet Union has already launched a rocket, Sputnik, and America is being left behind.  Their only hope is the Explorer I rocket.  Past rockets have all failed, and if this one fails, that will be it for the United States.    The book opens with the main character, Luke, waking up in the restroom at a train station in Washington DC.  He is dressed in rags, reeks of booze, has no money, and his friend is a fellow hobo.  He has no recollection of his past, how he got to be where he is, or who he is for that matter.    So begins this fast-paced novel of espionage, deceit, conspiracy and Soviet spies.  As the story continues, Luke discovers, slow inch by inch, details of his past and who he is.  Juxtaposed with this is the necessary launching of the Explorer I rocket.  Luke discovers that is someone important, related to the Explorer 1 launching, and that there was something he trying to do to prevent a possible sabotaging of the Explorer 1.    As we pursue the present, we are given chapters in Luke's past and his friends from Harvard.  The girls in his life, and his best friend; none of which he can remember, but the read is made privy to these details.    It is not until the last fourth of the book that further details are revealed, where his best friend and even his wife are not who he thinks they are.  The only help he has is from a girl who he loved at one point, but didn't talk to for years due to an unmentioned aborting - the death of his son.  But now this woman who he never trusted is his only help, the only one who is on his side and the one person he can use to prevent the launching of the Explorer 1 an make it a fantastic explodingfirework display - the failure of the Capitalists and the triumph of the Communists.    Ken Follett does a great service to the spy novel of the Cold War, keeping true to the particular time frame, when the CIA was in its infant stages, the Korean War was over, and the Vietnam War had yet to begin.    If one has a penchant for faced-paced spy novels, with the Yanks against the Ruskies, this is the book for you.    Originally published on March 12th 2001 ©Alex C. Telander.

B00005JKJA|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />An ultimate coalescence of David Lynch's surrealist and mainstream talents, MULHOLLAND DR. can certainly be explained and understood. It's all here . . . All the familiar Lynch-isms sewn into a bizarre, tight package (Labyrinthine structure, hot sex, oldies music and large red, velvet curtains on-board, Captain). Witness our trusty auteur perform the expert trick of accurately translating the possibilities of \\"Dream-Time\\" to film.<br /><br />Starting from frame one (including the groovy 50's dancers), the viewer becomes submerged in Naomi Watts' dream (notice the pillow shown for a few seconds). The dream is based on her recent experiences with people she knows well or has merely glanced at briefly (Cowboy, Espresso-dude, Winkies diner guy) dwelling in her dream chambers with elaborate storylines. Her wish for stardom, girl-on-girl lust and shameful, murderous guilt fuel Watts' visions. Although she's not in many scenes, every scene is wholly part of her dream and moves towards one conclusion: Her object of desire is slain and she is responsible for the vile crime. The drop-dead beautiful Laura Elena Haring utters her final line \\"Donde estas?\\" before vanishing from Naomi's sub-conscious and existence all-together. After Diane Selwyn awakens, all action takes place mostly via flashback as we learn piece by piece how the elements of the dream formed. The only \\"real-time\\" shown is her final hour, in the apartment.<br /><br />In a nutshell, she's love-sick and insane, went ahead and hired a hit-man to murder her ex-lover (Rita/Camila) and kills herself with the police banging on the door. The \\"little\\" old people are hallucinations perhaps representing her conscience like a Lynch-ian \\"Jiminy Cricket.\\" As for the grimy, scary homeless guy behind Winkies, well, by Diane's dream logic, this handsome fellow exists as the puppet-master of her fate and is \\"making it all happen.\\" After all, he does possess the magic box . . . You know, all simple as a TV sitcom!<br /><br />If you're not into cerebral kookiness then, by all means, stay far away from this movie. However, if you are, MULHOLLAND DR. is a gorgeous and dark revelation.TV sitcom!<br /><br />If you're not into cerebral kookiness then, by all means, stay far away from this movie.

1400079144|3.0|Dan Brown begins his third book featuring the symbologist Robert Langdon with a trip on a private jet to our country's capital.  Readers will think Langdon has done pretty well for himself to be traveling in this way, when it is revealed that he is being flown to Washington DC after receiving an urgent call from a colleague to perform a lecture at the National Statuary Hall at the Capitol.  There he finds an empty room with no indications of a lecture to be performed, but instead a recently severed hand with the fingers posed in a specific way, the index and thumb tattooed.    And so begins The Lost Symbol adventure, as Brown takes readers on a ride they won't soon forget.  Langdon soon finds himself forcefully helping Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security as they attempt to track down the owner of the severed hand, Langdon's close friend Peter Solomon.  Brown has taken his time with this novel, doing the research and creating a fuller, more rounded story over The Da Vinci Code, keeping the reader more entranced with what's going on, but also making sure to inform them about the subject and history of Freemasonry and how it all ties in with the Founding Fathers.    The solution to the overall mystery becomes a relatively obvious one for any skilled mystery reader, but the story is compelling, filled with details and supposed facts that will have readers wondering about the founding of this very country and who these people really were.

031603438X|5.0|I got the audio edition of Keith Richard's 'Life' It's read by Johnnie Depp and is amazing. I suggest going and getting the audio version, ripping a rail, fire up a bowl and listen. the first story of getting busted in Arkansas is epic and reads as if HST wrote it himself.  Just great
B003U0AHBO|4.0|There have been si many robinhood remakes, this is one of the best. It beats the Robin Hood with Kevin Costner hands down.  With Russle Crowe as Robinhood and Kate Bachette as Mariam, they seem to blend well in this film.  What a great ensamble of top notch actors, that made the film work, however, sadly the action scenes fell flat.  It was very interesting take on Richard the LionHearted, howeer the action was slaow and tedious.  I felt the movie was worth buying, just beacause I like the actors. but for action it was dissapointing.  The merry man were actually merry, but it was a tempered merry. They sujng songs and danced.  I thought one part of the film were the introduced some youngsters as thieves was reminiscience of the planet Ewok, from Star Wars.....Yuu'll know the scens that I am talking about when you see the movie........  Rent it first to see if you like it....I found it to be just ok...........
0316098337|4.0|I enjoyed this book though it was rather disturbing in some areas.  The writer has a good grasp on the challenges a young mother would face in raising a child in such a confined area.  Writing from the child's perspective added to the story.

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|It doesn't matter if you come from London, Paris or San Francisco. It doesn't matter if we speak the same language.<br />We live in the same world, undergo similar experiences, and respond to those experiences in different ways.  Some of those experiences offer insights into something more that lies beyond the everyday reality you can see hear of touch.<br /><br />A female French tv journalist has a near death experience in an island resort in the tsunami which jolts her out of her ordinary everyday reality. A 12 year old London boy copes with the sudden death of his twin brother goes into foster care while his mother goes into rehab, and seeks answers, and Matt Damon plays a reluctant 'real' psychic  in San Francisco who people seek in their quest for answers. He has the gift which he considers a curse.  If you are like me, as you watch you wonder if there is an invisible thread that will somehow connect these three stories, will their paths somehow cross.<br /><br />Hereafter shows a major shift in direction for Clint Eastwood, and Matt Damon.  All of Clint Eastwood movies tend to be grounded in reality, whereas Hereafter moves to a metaphysical level.  Some people who usually like Clint Eastwood movies won't like this transition.  So, you have been warned.  Matt Damon often plays action heroes, not renowned for their psychic abilities.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a blue blue collar worker who has spurned his spiritual gift in favor of labor.  He used to be famous, and now chooses to be anonymous and his brother encourages him to return to this potentially lucrative life.  As the movie progresses and we see the interaction between him and Bryce Dallas Howard, (Ron Howard's daughter), we understand how his gift which is activated by touch, blocks him from true intimacy and prevents him from having a proper romantic relationship.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed watching the San Francisco sequences. The bar scene between Matt Damon, and his brother played by Jay Mohr was filmed at the Final Final, my local bar, and he sits at the exact same spot I often sit at.  In fact, I had a near Clint experience. He left the bar, after one of the patrons got a little out of control, and I arrived twenty minutes later.  Darn..Can you imagine.  Clint Eastwood practically at your doorstep, and you miss him.<br /><br />I loved watching the local scenes, many of the interior shots were filmed in real locations, you get the sense of an ordinary cramped walk up apartment in San Francisco, and the flash of the Hobart Building, before the office scene. This adds to the authenticity of the movie.  How many movies have you seen where somebody has a regular job yet lives in a fancy loft.<br /><br />A couple of scenes in this movie I thought were remarkable, one where where he spoon feeds her while she is blindfolded.  I also love the scene where he gives the final reading, and ad libs a comforting message even though you can tell from his  facial expression that he has lost the connection.  Even real psychics can be fake sometimes.  Beautifully played.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that other than Matt Damon, this cast is mostly full of unknowns, the standard of the actors is amazing.  English actress, Lyndsey Marshal demonstrates tremendous presence, as Martin's mother.  Bryce Dallas Howard though young looks like a long ago movie star.  Cecile de France, the Belgian born French actress, has a certain chic appeal, and is a well established actress.<br /><br />If you are like me sometimes when you see a movie, you forget about it almost immediately, I find myself still thinking about this one a week later.  If you are curious to go see this one, you still won't know what you don't already know.<br /><br />If you like this movie, I recommend Aftershock, which has some parallels with this movie.  Set in China, instead of a tsunami we have an earthquake, and a mother is faced with the crushing dilemma of only being able to save one of her twin children the girl or the boy.  By lifting the concrete beam under which they are trapped one will be saved, and the other will die. Based on the real event of the Tangshan earthquake in which 240,000 people perished, it's one of the most powerful of the year, and sure to be nominated for best foreign movie.re trapped one will be saved, and the other will die.

B002N5N5R0|5.0|One of the best shows currently on television.  While lacking realism in many ways, it more than makes up for it with great characters, interesting visuals and hard hitting, often brutal, story arcs.  The fact that is it is HD on Blu-ray is the icing on the proverbial cake.
0439023521|5.0|I wanted to read this book because it was recommended by my favorite performer, Adam Lambert.    I didn't think it was my kind of story at first, but the writing was compelling and I didn't want to put it down for anything.  After I found out it was a trilogy, I ordered the other 2 books, Catching Fire and Mockinjay.    I'm 1/2 way through the second one and am enjoying it just as much as the 1st one.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|ACID ROCK RESURRECTION ! Jason Bonham, Glenn Hughes, Joe Bonamassa, and Derek Sherinian you can't go wrong. What a line up! I had feelings listening to this like I haven't had since the first time I ever heard Burn. DON\\"T WAIT TILL THERE ALL GONE, or you will be sorry. I can't say enough about this album, it's so good. TRUST ME...you haven't heard rock like this from a new band in ages. \\"Song of yesterday\\" now that is some great guitar work that actually compares to some of Blackmore and Page's finest work... YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT Flee to the record store in terror right now ! Don't listen to that other dude he is crazy ! \\"WE ARE BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR ROCK AND ROLL\\" if you like 70's hard rock,blues,metal,classic rock this will crank your chain. Don't pass up a chance to see this band live...<br />(OLGA got a new Mexican Bull Whip for Christmas) GOTTA go
0441013597|1.0|Excellent book, however the printing company has done a horrible job.  They have not left enough space between the binding line and the words and one needs to struggle with every page to be able to read the book.  Such a disrespect to this masterpiece and the author. Amazon should refuse to sell defected books of that sort to its clients. Shame on ACE printing company for doing such a lousy job.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I think I like them better...(sorry Udo) The mix is great. The new singer is great. The guitar work is great. The song writing is great, as well as the lyrics. The album cover is really cool, graphics,  everything!!! I cant find any reason you should not take the plunge and, buy this record. I have seen 100 rock/metal shows, was a hard rock singer for many years and, I am also a collector...grab this one and they'll give YOU the axe !<br />OLGA\\"S drinking vodka ! Who told her what the upcoming release was going to be titled ? You can come and deal with it !
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|I have not been compelled to write a review for a film in quite some time.  Let me summarize the target-demographic audience who would enjoy this...residents of the morgue, anybody who bought the farm, the comatose, and possibly those in dire need of money so they volunteer for experimental drug-testing with the government.  In short--the brain dead!!<br /><br />First a couple things about myself, so you can determine whether or not you will identify with my tastes.<br /><br />I'ma guy, I love guy movies (No Country For Old men, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Jackie Chan movies, Transformers, last Hulk, Blade series, etc.).  I eagerly await films like the new Tron, Thor, etc.  I'MA GUY, I like good action with credible characters...<br /><br />With that said!!<br /><br />I really, REALLY, REALLY disagree with the cast of characters.  I feel like these actors are forced on you and there is little to no credibility for their \\"hardcore\\" edge.  Adrian Brody??  SERIOUSLY?!  This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's successor?!  Arnold was a classic hero in the original plot, he had credibility as a tough guy.  The guy from The Pianist however???  NOT SO MUCH!!  Casting Topher Grace, he was slightly out of place but he filled his role, the other losers in this film didn't add the slightest bit of credibility that they should have lended to their on-screen personas.  Everything about this film is so artificial.<br /><br />The predators, which I am a huge fan of in the movie universe, have little on-screen time.  We're talkin' maybe 15-20 minutes of the film, which is pretty sad 'cause the film is 109 minutes running.  The predators seem to get weaker and weaker in the film industry.  When they debuted back in 1989 in the original film, AN ELITE SPECIAL FORCES TEAM had their hands FULL!!!  They nearly all bought the farm against ONE SINGLE PREDATOR!!<br /><br />Then the sequel, a jelly-donut grazer was able to stop predator, AVP, a freaking scientist...seriously, just an ordinary female scientist!!  The predator, if you branch out into more than just the films, but in video games, comics, etc., is supposed to be one of the most formidable forces in the known universe.  These films do nothing to lend to that credibility or even honor the idea of the Predator race.  This film follows suit and makes the Predators appear weaker than ever!  The casting is horrible, the plot cheesier, I liked the second AVP more than this and that's a statement 'cause that plotline was crap!<br /><br />You would expect a lot of special effects and wow did they blow it here too, one of the staples of the Predator arsenal--the shoulder-mounted laser cannon--hahahaha, they shot one of the characters with no body armor and there was barely a first-degree burn, I seriously think the Predator could have just cloaked, walked up to the guy and gave him an \\"Indian\\" rug burn with more consequence than his laser cannon.  The production team for this film really did a grave injustice to everything that characterizes what a Predator should be.  The cloaking special effects are cheesier, the \\"team\\" against the predators have a very, VERY weak arsenal.  We're talking about MP-5ks, pistols, an automatic shotgun, and one mini-gun.  The premise of how the film introduces the characters as well???  Laughable...they try to dress it up in mystery but it's just cheesy.<br /><br />Please save your money or rent.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time trying to be unbiased but that's just how bad this film is.  I have a lot of tolerance for the original AVP 'cause at least it was cool and had some worthy action scenes, albeit a lame culmination for the plot.  But this is worse than the last AVP, in my opinion.  So you do the mathematics, if you've seen it...ask yourself if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />Whoever is endorsing this really has no taste in quality, and while that's subjective, I strongly urge you to consider the merits of being a 40-year old soccer mom and knowing anything about warfare.  The plot had some neat ideas but was poorly executed.  Please avoid purchase at all costs!!ase avoid purchase at all costs!!

B001DHXT2A|5.0|I still think Ed Norton was probably the best David Banner.You really get a feel for how lonely his existence is as he deals with his affliction. The Hulk looks more convincing in this version than he did in the previous film by Ang Lee. I felt that the dvd could have had a few more extras thrown in considering this is supposed to be a \\"special edition\\". Overall, other than my concerns regarding the extras, I had no other issues with the special edition.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I), which included both the theatrical and extended films, who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set (I will be returning mine). I encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it. Whether it's in these reviews, a blog or emails directly to Warner Bros., letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they'll even consider terminating these shady business practices.  I will be voicing my displeasure on the Warner Bros. Studios' website on the customer service page.
B000001TVD|5.0|This album has been on my mind for a LONG TIME! When I found the CD on Amazon, I was thrilled beyond words! I loved this music (this album in particular) when I was a teen. The sound is crystal clear and the tunes took me back to fond memories. I remembered almost every word of the tunes as well! The conversion of old school (70s, 80s, and 90s) tunes into CD is the best thing anyone could have done! Thank you and keep the good stuff coming and affordable prices, Amazon!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Very well acted.   Excellent costumes.  Wonderful sets.  Close enough to historical accuracy for me.   I thoroughly enjoyed each of the shows and will undoubtedly watch all of them again in a year.    This set was a great addition to my library.
B0035V35P8|5.0|I bought this video for my daughter, who is CRAZY about \\"Rain\\" or Bai, the hero in this story. The theme was heroic and impressive but the special effects left much to be desired. Once the action started it was almost non-stop. However, to me, gore is not something to sensationalize and it was not even that realistic. Rain is very good in this picture considering that he IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTIST but really a singer and dancer! I was impressed. For anyone looking for action and gore, this is the movie. Anyone looking for serious ninja activity, this is the movie. Anyone who is CRAZY about this guy Rain, this is the movie. But, for anyone lookingn for serious special effects...you won't find them here.
B002TUO2K8|5.0|So, we watched the pilot halfway through the first season (after we were told we simply had to watch the show). Needless to say, we were hooked and had no problem buying the entire first half of season one a la cart just to watch. The challenge in this episode produced some amazing \\"mash-up\\" performances.
B0047SF41G|3.0|The entire series has always been a little weak on backstory, although the first made a stab at it. Here, the gaps overwhelm the film.  A specialist group has been chosen from Earth as prey. Chosen by whom? The predators would have to be intimately immersed in earth culture to put together this group; and they're not.  Do they have a human agent who does their selection?  No explanation is even hinted at.    Brody, while a competent actor, is a stupendously bad choice as the protagonist; he's way too cerebral and articulate. Imagine Spock in the role played by Arnold in the first film. This poor casting choice is completely eclipsed by the choice of Topher Grace as the major bad guy; his denouement is utterly clumsy and lacks any credibility. This poor schlemiel is simply incapable of playing the heavy. Larry Fishburne is also miscast, poorly directed, or needs to retire before he further embarrasses himself.    Finally, the means by which the predators are overcome (temporarily) is stilted and counter-intuitive; it just doesn't make any sense that the remaining chief bullgoose predator can be undone by an unarmed, beaten Brody and a \\"paralyzed\\" chick.    This film works only as a sendup of the previous episodes in the series.  Unfortunately, no one seems to have informed the actors that it needed to be played tongue-in-cheek.    And a big payday was enjoyed by all.
B003O205RY|5.0|...and didn't mind a lick shelling out a few bucks to watch an episode we'd missed.
0982743726|5.0|I was fortunate to receive a copy of Walter Rhein's fantasy novel, \\"The Bone Sword,\\" before its release so I could give a review. Well, here's my review.<br />The Bone Sword is a fun, action-packed adventure that follows a tough-as-nails warrior named Malik and a brother and sister team who are on the run from the evil Father Ivory. When I say evil, I mean torturing and lopping off hands and heads evil. A word of caution, this isn't a story for the squeamish. The sister, Jasmine, has the ability to heal people which, as you can imagine, is blasphemy to self-proclaimed religious types such as Father Ivory.<br />If, when reading a book, the number one goal is to be entertained, then Walter has succeeded. You often hear people say that they couldn't put a book down but that doesn't make it any less true. I enjoyed the characters and the action and the pacing to a point I found myself constantly saying one more chapter before I went off to bed. As such, I would be happy to recommend Walter's book to anyone looking for a fast-paced fantasy novel.<br />If what I've heard about a sequel is true, we can expect more from Walter's fantasy mind which will have me first in the figurative line to preorder. Good work, Walter and good luck with the release.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I knew I was NOT going to like this film & I was right.    Fan of the show, although I did not get into until season 3.    The first film was OK.  BUT a lot of story mistakes but you could kind of enjoy it     When I heard about the storyline for this 2cd film it did NOT sound good..    All four of the woman's lives were NOT happy.  NONE of them.  They had to make up ways to get all the important supporting characters in just to make fans happy.    Who bought the Stanford & Anthony wedding?  Nope.  Said in the movie they did NOT like each other in the series, you can buy  them becoming friends because they were friends with the girls.  Then the over the top wedding?    Made up reasons to bring Smith (Jerry) and Adian back.  Bringing in 15 minutes about up Cyrus.  NO BUSINESS IN THE FILM.     Carrie & John storyline.  Wrong to have a TV in the bed room, this was the best they could do?    The reason Samantha  got the free trip?  She was NOT sleeping with any of the men to get it so another do NOT buy the story line.  They did NOT like Los Angeles but loved the Middle East  until the Samantha storyline.  Then they came up with seen a million times so called plot twists before they got out of the Middle East.    The much talked about \\"flashback\\".  Not worth the VERY BRIEF camera time.    Film too long.    The storyline with Charlotte's nanny.  WHO OTHER THAN TO GET A STORY IDEA WOULD LET THEIR NANNY DRESS LIKE THAT ON THE JOB?  No one.  Then the end of the movie lame get out of that storyline.    Miranda quitting then just without back up as to what happened she had a new job at the end of the film.     A huge misstep.  They over hyped the film then it disappointed at the box office.  Of course, looked at what you over hyped.    2 lame extras and then......    I HATE THESE THINGS.  The DVD makers used one of these CHEAP, INTENTIONAL HOLES PLASTIC CASES.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP BUT THEY DO NOT DROP THE PRICE OF THE DVD.  So, the DVD can be damaged for repurchase BUT NO ONEWILL WANT TO REPURCHASE THIS.  No chapter search list.    A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
B002KFPMBA|3.0|If you like the show and want to know a little more back story, this is a good watch. Be warned, however, it's very obviously one of those hastily assembled behind-the-scenes deals with low production values of its own.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|Bruce Willis may be old but he sure doesn't act like he's over the hill.  Karl Urban's performance didn't disappoint either. We saw this movie yesterday and all us were of the consensus that it was entertaining and definitely worth getting on Blu-ray.

As we're also big fans of Kristin Chenoweth, this was an especially cool episode to watch. It was nice to see her take a departure from the previous roles we've seen her in (Wicked, West Wing, Pushing Daisies) and take on simple drunk. :-)
B000PHOY0A|5.0|I picked up a copy of this book at the home of my son, who is working toward his phd.  I got so interested in it I bought my own copy.  It's easy to read, (I have only a high school education) interesting and answers a lot of questions we have about why certain groups of people advanced so much faster than others.  They weren't smarter, they just had access to easier to grow foods or easier to domesticate animals. This is a fascinating book, even for someone who rarely reads non-fiction. I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of mankind.

B001HM1PFO|3.0|I attended a performance/screening of this because friends were involved in the local production. Then I watched the video for the first time on Amazon On-Demand. I found both experiences pleasant, and I really enjoyed dancing during the audience participation and having rice and cold water thrown at me (mild adrenaline rush!). On the other hand, I didn't find much of the humor in the audience participation to be actually funny--mostly tired and harsh/crude. But overall I definitely enjoyed being there with friends and the local community, the outrageous costumes and safe shedding of inhibitions.    I also enjoyed seeing the movie for the first time so that I could actually catch the dialogue/lyrics and experience the characters as intended. Again, a lot of things didn't \\"work\\" for me about the movie--especially the lack of plot, point, or sane character development--but a bisexual caste prancing around in garters made up for a lot of that, as did the memories of audience-participation. I feel pretty \\"meh\\" about the soundtrack overall, but some of it adds a lot to the \\"coolness\\" factor.    If you're not already a Rocky Horror fan, don't grab this expecting it to be brilliant. Try to experience the audience participation, or at least think about whether this is the sort of spectacle (it's not much of a story) you'd like.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This first book lays the groundwork in journalism and magazine editorial that the reader must learn in order to have a point-of-reference for the remainder of this story and the two which follow this one. Great mystery not easily unraveled; super ending! Read all-three!
B003Q6D282|3.0|Dear Saw,<br /><br />You and I need to have a private little talk.<br /><br />Over the past few years you've been quite successful, a real franchise. You've been coming down with something since Saw V though, and I'd know this because I was there, as with many fans, of the Franchise. Actually IV was starting to show signs of wear. And this shows that since Saw 3 struck gold, you thought \\"Hey, well, I'm Saw, I can pump out anything since I made a real smash at the B.O.\\". Well hate to rain on your parade, but, even despite Saw VI being an improvement on this long in the tooth series, it's been feeling like you're not even trying anymore.<br /><br />That isn't to say I hated your latest installment. I saw it tonight in 3D and actually didn't mind it too much. However though, despite entertainment value, I feel as if you spent more time putting effort into 3D as opposed to story. We have Bobby Dagen, a Jigsaw survivor, who is out through a trap again and must save people he knows to save his wife. We have a battle between Hoffman and Jill for Jigsaw's legacy. We have reunions of people who have survived Jigsaw.<br /><br />These storylines are all interesting, I'll admit. But there are lots of holes in them, and there aren't any truly terrifying moments. Sure there are creepy moments, but creepy just isn't enough. What happened to moments like the \\"Camera flash\\" scene in Saw 1, or the well played and intense scene where Jeff, having just lost his daughter, has to choose between burning her possessions to free the judge who wrongly sentenced the daughter's killer, or letting the judge drown in pig guts and trapping the memory of his daughter?? Sure the scene where Bobby has to help his close friend (whose eyes are covered) walk across loose planks in high areas and set him free is intense, but it doesn't have the same intensity as those two moments mentioned, or the conversation between Jigsaw and Eric in Saw 2 (which was totally brilliant).<br /><br />Overall I am happy that this is the last in your series, because I think its time you and I took some time off from each other. It's been a nice ride and all, but honestly, I think it's time you went to bed for good. While this film wasn't bad, it's definitely good that the series is over. But hey you may come back someday, Saw. Or Saw 3D (or whatever you call yourself nowadays).<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Renfieldcause I think its time you and I took some time off from each other.

It was a totally unique concept for me to read a book about a troubled young girl, particularly one in another country.  Uniqueness is a big draw with me.  Second, it was a totally unique story line, once again making it a hit with me.  Finally, once I was able to digest the long list of characters in each book, particularly in Tattoo, I was able to power read them all in a variety of settings requiring more or less concentration.  The stories hung together well without many puzzling unexplained gaps.  I also saw the Tattoo movie and liked it a lot, even though it was not in English.<br /><br />Too bad Steig died.

0399156577|5.0|I am one of the fortunate few have read NORA ROBERTS from her very first book right through to this one....And I have to say she continues to deliver some of the best dialogue between characters that I've ever read.<br />Maybe it becomes a little too deep for some people who want a little more playtime and action. (I don't know) For me ...it works!<br />This book was all about a seriously strong woman who got that way because of a life threatening experience with a serial killer when she was younger and a lot less experienced. She loses her police officer fiance and his canine partner and helps stop a killer and put him in prison. Instead of allowing these things to cripple her she then heals and from those ashes gains a sensitivity into how to get people and animals to work well with one another.<br />I was intrigued by the tough aggressiveness of the characters and how Nora made a reluctant relationship work! The rescue training helped me relate better with two people who are in no way easy to predict and are what most strong/alpha types have to be. It allowed the author to show pieces of their character that could not be seen otherwise.<br />This was not a book about training search and rescue dogs ONLY. It is a story about a woman who has a gift for training dogs to be life savers and can also use that training to understand and deal with a very intense and hard to please man.<br />Its about a woman who is once again in danger of a killer and how she deals with that reality.<br />This book is able to impress upon women how strong they can be if only they try and not be victims in the face of everpresent danger.<br />I loved this book...felt happy about the end and can't wait to read another new NORA ROBERTS novel!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is the best book in the world! I am a huge fan of percy jackson and when i heard about the lost hero i was really exited. I just finished it and i need the next one to come out soon or i think i might shoot myself! You should definetly read this book, no matter how old you are i know anyone with a sense of humor and imagination will love it! :)
B003U53GK8|2.0|A rather cliche' ending to the series. Truthfully this show started getting bad after about the second season.<br /><br />The streaming service was great, the show just sucked.
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought this CD because my 3 year old daughter is a HUGE fan of Fearless, and I enjoyed it as well.  This one is every bit as good as the last one if not better. My daughter is already learning the songs and singing them in the car.  Nice to have something we both like to listen to and I don't have to worry about her hearing something inappropriate! Love this cd!
B000068QJX|5.0|Let's do the technical stuff first.  First DVD release was horrible.  Video was washed out and audio was not great.  Probably rushed out when film started to take off in the mid 90's.  It had a minor success when released in Australia in 1992.  People there knew of it and it developed a \\"cult\\" following...and launched Baz Luhrmann's directorial career.  Australian movies are light on sets and are mainly shot on location, so some of the \\"inside\\" angles, lighting and composition aren't Hollywood. Video quality in later releases was much better, the latest DVD relase has brilliant colors and the audio is digitized.  All in all a DVD of respectable quality. (Get the DVD in the case showing a red curtain)  I have not yet seen the blu-ray version.  Vendors are holding it hostage at about US$25.00..so I'll wait.  Now, the story & its production.  I worked with video in the TV news biz for 50 years so I know a little bit abut film techniques that might help you along in your understanding of how certain \\"feelings\\" are extracted from the audience.  Luhrmann starts off the movie with a musical flourish, swirling colors and good music (he's got your eye now)...then segues into a semi-documentary style with several of the actors talking in soundbites ala local TV to help set up the story(now you understand the story and its emotional base).  And its a story of the intense competition in amateur dance in Australia.  If you fear soccer moms and their intensity or Little League dads...well you get the idea.  The fact that young Scott is a rebellious lad who has tremendous talent, but no desire to dance the steps dictated by Australian Dance Federation rules...has his mother and partner upset to the point of tears.   Enter Fran, a rookie student at the same dance school where Scott's the number one male dancer.  Luhrmann is sneaky.  He and crew do some neat things to make their story move along and help you see that the two main characters are the core of the story...and help you figure out that there's more going on between Scott and Fran than a tango or two. Notice that all the other dance pairs are looking away from each other when they dance, while Scott and Fran are always looking at each other.  Tells you right away where their focus is.  Notice how, at the beginning, Fran really is an ugly duckling. (Morice played her role without makeup it seems for the first third of the movie--that takes guts). Then her hair settles down, the makeup goes on and she becomes a really nice looking girl...not sexy, but like many attractive girls....certainly someone any of us merely human males could find and get acquainted with at a high school dance.  And with that change, and her determination, the audience falls for Fran in her quest...first to dance with Scott, even though she's a rookie....and then her increasing infatuation with him.  Reviewers said the movie had Australian women crying and Australian men joining dance clubs.  You'll love the movie. It's now somehwerre in my top five all time, along with Casablanca, The third Man, Lawrence of Arabia and Bourne 3. And it needs a sequel.  Fran & Scott need to complete their relationship.  Other notes:  Paul Mercurio (Scott)is currently hosting a cooking show, and is a judge in the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars.  Tara Morice, Fran, is still an actress.  She has had minor parts in several Lurhmann productions and larger parts in a couple of other movies and on Australian TV.  Before Strictly Ballroom she had never danced professionally.  She also sings one of the songs on the soundtrack which is worth owning.  Mercurio is the son of an American-turned-Australian charactor actor you saw in Crocodile Dundee.  He is a dancer by trade who had never acted till Strictly Ballroom.  By the way, he finished the big ending scene on a badly sprained ankle.
B003X8597A|1.0|Now that I know this is \\"updated\\", I will not buy this DVD.  I love this opera and was delighted to see it has finally been recorded on DVD.  My first shock was the cuts in Wagner's fabulous music.  His original RIENZI was nine hours long and I regret I could never hear the entire performance.  NOW THIS... NO.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I love SoA. I waited forever for season two to be released on DVD since I couldn't watch it on TV.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|This is the sound that first got me interested in Dylan.  I had the vinyl LPs and they were mono and they were fantastic.  That style was restored here.  I wasn't at the remastering sessions but so often less is more.  I think they forego the hissing removal and compressing the overall sound to be louder it sounds they laid off of that and just did the minimum to the master tape to the CD format.  Dylan has never sounded better.  Mono is the way Dylan should be heard as ??? the booklet writer wrote and he's correct on that, the sound is vibrant and it's alive and real as anything you want to hear. I mean that the sound is so real it's chilling.  If your reading this you know the 1st Dylan albums and what they sound like most were very basic recordings nothing by way of expansive elaborateness.  Also don't forget you get a download of all the albums in high quality and you get the bonus track of positively 4th street on which is not included in the box set from the physical discs as it was never issued on an album except of course various greatest hits and compliations which isn't a regular album by any means.
0375842209|5.0|I send books to a relative incarcerated in one of the nation's toughest prisons.  When he finishes reading them, he passes them on to others in his block.  Previously, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, et al. kept them guessing as to each book's conclusion.  This week, though,  I learned that it is The Book Thief which is having a startling effect.  My relative writes that his two fellow readers have finished the book also, and one confessed \\"that certain spots made him 'emotional\\"\\".  This inmate had also discussed it with the second one, \\"who confirmed that he had to set the book down a few times because he felt the same.\\"  !!!  I read this book on a weeklong backpacking trip this summer, and tore it in half (sorry, book) when I got partway so my son could start reading the book.  He hates fiction, but enjoyed this.  So, whether you are a regular mom, a teenage boy, or a supposedly hardened criminal, you can be moved by this book.  I have sent many books to my relative, but this is the first one with such a reaction reported from his co-readers.  I hope I will \\"hit it right\\" again--everyone needs these experiences.
B00136M0GC|5.0|His wistful voice and soft acoustics are hypnotizing and completely relax me :) I cannot stop listening to this album. I like every song on the album.
1401324029|5.0|In a continuation of the brilliant marketing that characterized the arrival of the tv series Castle, the second in the \\"Heat\\" series is as delightful a read as the first. Written by the fictitious Richard Castle, the book is easily translatable into the squad we see every Monday on our screens and the story, while not intense, deep or in any way extraordinary, is enjoyable and well written. It's a must for fans of the show, and a satisfactory read for lovers of crime novels with a penchant for a light touch.      Highly recommended, as is the tv show. Well written, humorous and intelligent. Can't ask for much more than that.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I got this yesterday and I researched it and tried it out and it works great! some assembly and it works right away! Great Metal Detector!
B000MLNUBI|4.0|I read the other reviews, and I can tell that most people buy this watch because it is stylish. While that is not a bad reason, you should have full disclosure.<br /><br />A) This is an automatic, mechanical (not quartz) watch.  They are inherently less accurate than quartz. This is the technology we had before quartz burst on the scene in the 1970s. As a result, expect that it can be off by as much as 30 seconds per day. On this watch, you won't necessarily notice, as there are no dial markers. You will only know the time to the nearest 5 minutes anyway. Face it, you are not buying this watch for the accuracy. Plan on setting it once a week, and you might be surprised to notice that you are more confident about your watch than the quartz owner who never checks his watch!<br /><br />B) On the other hand, the result of this being automatic is that it will never need a battery. It winds automatically using gravity, your normal wrist movement, and a weighted rotor, which one can see through the display back. You can also hand wind it to get it started. With this watch, one can see the mainspring right through the face, so you know approximately how much of a wind is on it! Really cool.<br /><br />C) This is a Swatch, which means it cannot be opened. This is the big sacrifice with Swatches. If they die, they're dead. This makes them cheaper to produce without sacrificing any quality. The downside is that if worn daily, you can expect a lifetime of probably 5-10 years. Mechanical watches have their parts under tension always. Some parts more than others. Occasionally, they need to be taken apart, cleaned, and lubricated. With this watch, that is not going to happen. It was designed to have a limited lifetime. By contrast, quartz watches have hardly any pressure on their movements. The better quality quartz watches have jewels that the wheel pivots turn in. I'm not sure if Swatches do.<br /><br />D) Compared to a quartz watch, these mechanical watches have a lot more character. The seconds hand moves more smoothly and quietly. Swatch quartzes, especially, are VERY loud. Mine will keep me awake at night from across the room if I don't put it in a drawer. They also need a battery every year, which gets old.<br /><br />E) The bracelet is a mixed blessing. When brand new, it is polished to a high gloss, inside and out. Ditto with the case of the watch. It looks sharp, but it picks up scratches easily. The bracelet has many pivot points, so it forms to the wrist easily and comfortably. The links are solid metal. The clasp is very positive. The only problem is that since the links are also polished on the inside, it tends to stick to the wrist, and this is not comfortable. Some people won't notice it.<br /><br />F) The crystal is acrylic, rather than mineral or sapphire glass. The plus side is that it is impossible to break. The negative side is that it is very easy to scratch. If you want, you can polish it again back to look like new with a rotary tool, a buffing wheel, and some plastic polishing compound. Mineral glass is much harder to scratch, but it can be done. Once scratched, it is about impossible to polish. But it is cheaper than sapphire and harder than acrylic. Sapphire glass is nearly impossible to scratch. It takes a gemstone. But it is more expensive.<br /><br />FINAL RECOMMENDATION: If you are aware of the pros and cons mentioned above and still want this watch for its unique design and stunning good looks, buy it. There are no skeleton watches of this quality for this price elsewhere. If you like the idea of an automatic and are willing to give up the skeleton face, look at Seiko 5s here on amazon. The cost less, have \\"Hardlex\\" crystals, (mineral glass) are more accurate, and are fully serviceable. It is not uncommon for them to run 20 years without service, and then they only need a clean & lube. Mine runs about +12s per day. If you really just want the better accuracy, pretty much any quartz watch will beat these automatics. Spend at least $50 and you'll get superb accuracy, in the range of 1/2s per day to 2s per day.<br /><br />Edit 19Feb2012 - I have a rather fanatical commentator to this review who is claiming this watch has a mineral crystal. That is false. (no matter what the Amazon spec. indicates at this time) The Amazon specs. also indicate that it has a Japanese movement. That too, is false. It has a Swiss ETA 2842. For more on the subject, google 'anatomy of an $85 Swatch.'of 1/2s per day to 2s per day.

0765326353|5.0|From start to finish, this book is epic. Just the first book of an esitmated 10 book series, this is a wonderful stand-alone novel. There are many main characters, and some strong female characters as well. Simply put, I could not put this book down and it is just fantastic, and I eagerly await the next book.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|My kids love it, my wife and I still adore and enjoy the film.  Now that the movie is on Blu-Ray its better than ever.
B000056H24|5.0|I love this Movie, I am not Crazy about Short-Haired Jesus,Telly Savalas is superb he makes me want to punch him right in the face through the TV, And who stole the Movie is Charlton Heston As St John The Baptist, The Jesus is not bad in this Movie, the movie is good and sticks to what I grew up on and love,It would be hard to Pinpoint what's the Best Jesus Movie, Probably The Passion Of The Christ so far is one of my favorites,but this one is up there it is not as Brutal but then again Jesus Story was Brutal,but If you have kids you would watch this one with them or many of the other ones, As A Catholic I found it pretty refreshing and I like that it was filmed in The States a First for this type of movie.
B00336G7HI|5.0|Typical high quality product from Sony.  No problems.  Almost can't miss with Sony.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller. No doubt about it.    But why no USB cable? It makes Sony look cheap and it's a hassle if you don't have one of these laying around, not to mention another 5 bucks and a round trip to Target to purchase one.    At least mention that fact in the product description.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is one of the best Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen. The scripts are excellent, the story interesting and the actors portraying Holmes and Watson have the characters down pat. Highly recommended.
B003IY48PS|1.0|This review is for the Blu-ray version.  The movie itself is classic horror, however the transfer to Blu-ray is horrible.  It is very grainy on both the standard and wide screen versions of the movie.  I also have a 1080p Roku box.  Streaming the same movie from it looks better than the Blu-ray version playing from my PlayStation 3.  I guess this is why they are only charging $10 for the disk. My advise is to wait until someone comes out with a better Blu-ray before purchasing this movie.
1400031354|5.0|This, the second novel in series picks up the story of Precious Ramotswe, owner of Botswana's only private detective agency shortly after the close of NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY.  Mma Ramotswe has accepted the proposal of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, and the two are working out the details of just how to combine their households and lives.  Precious has also undertaken a couple of cases, one involving a long missing son, the other an investigation of a possibly straying wife.  Rra Matekoni also has business concerns, his two apprentices are more interested in watching young women passing by the garage than fixing engines and his good deeds at the local orphanage has offered some unexpected returns.    The stories here are gentle ones, more often of everyday matters than extraordinary ones.  Straying spouses and other domestic matters appear here, not serial killers or long missing treasures.  The ever expanding cast of characters add their voices to these delightful tales of life in this exotic land.    Fans of the HBO series will recognize some, but not all of the stories told in this volume.  There is a strong overall story arc to this series so begin with THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY and proceed in order.

B003WTE886|5.0|These days, beautifully made, start to finish records are a rarity - and are made by in large, by artists who can't get arrested at radio. To me, \\"Speak Now\\" is the exception and  hearkens back to a time when records were made by artists - not just singers - and this is fitting as Taylor Swift wrote the album in its entirety. Every aspect of this enjoyable listen is rock solid - again, start to finish - and is as clever lyrically in places as heroes like Elvis Costello, as musically organic as Alison Krauss, and as rocking as Def Leppard.  The songs, \\"Speak Now\\", \\"Mean\\", and \\"Enchanted\\" will testify to the previous statement. This girl is on a roll and is obviously growing in to an old world artistry that is welcome and needed in the market place. 5 stars.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Recently got this, and it fits a perfect role in portability. After 13 years, I used it to finally sharped the small Gerber knife on my keychain. Very pleased with the diamond-tipped rod as I had a couple of serrated knives that needed sharpening, and now I've done it. For the price, portability, and ease of use, this product is worth the purchase in my opinion. And no, I am not a professional knife sharpener, but my knives are sharper now.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Most people know this movie; the 2nd installment in the Faverau directed Iron Man franchise. Great movie. Better than the first...   My review is on the customer service I recieved.

Plus, because the price went down between me ordering and recieving my movie, Amazon issued me a credit. A credit \\"post purchace\\". An unsolicited \\"post purchace\\" credit...   Now tell me, how many stores have done THAT for you?   My next Blu-Ray purchace? From Amazon for sure.

030745455X|5.0|this trilogy from Steig Larsson was wonderfully written.  It was hard to follow at first due to my unfamiliarity with the country, the language and the names, but once I got used to them, the reading just flowed along.  My biggest regret is that the author is dead and we can't look forward to any more of his works.  We can count ourselves lucky to have gotten this much of a work that will easily become a classic.
014062029X|5.0|About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book.  Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy.  Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in.  By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.<br />  Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder.  After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.<br />  End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge.  The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died.  They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.<br />  We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman.  We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter.  We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter.  Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.<br />  Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read.  When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level.  Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments.  But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical.  The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act.  Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.<br />  Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.<br />  (And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book.  To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)tragedy.

It's only 20 mins, so I try to add on more exercise by walking my dog or myself for 30 mins a day. But the workout itself is very challenging and motivating!

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Excellent. Much better than Iron Man 1. I have both Bluray DVD'S and they are awesome! Iron Man 3 is totally AWESOME it is the Best so far. I do not have a 3D TV but I saw it in the theater in 3D and it had me reaching out to try and touch things. I already have my AMAZON pre-order in for the Bluray and when the Directors Cut Extended version is available I will buy it!!!! Must see!!
B003EYVXXW|4.0|...then there's an element of this film that you will enjoy.  It is violent but just enough to color the landscape of Alexandria in Hypatia's time.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|A lot of chicklit now is same old-same old. But occasionally, you turn over a gem. This is the case with most of Sophie Kinsella's novels. Perhaps the Brits just do it better?? I just got through reading another British author generated chicklit (more of a spoof, really) mystery novel, [[ASIN:B0049H8X68 PINK CHAMPAGNE ON ICE]] by C.S. Challinor, who writes the Rex Graves mystery novels (\\"Christmas is Murder\\", etc.). This one's a standalone mystery featuring Florida real agent Angelica Lane.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This season of Chuck was great.  It answers a lot of questions and allows the viewers to move on.  The series is maturing and you need to watch this season.

0316098337|5.0|Room is simply the best book I have read in some time.  If you like good fiction--not the mass-market trype that so often passes for a \\"good book\\"--you simply must read this.  Read it.  Buy it.  It is mesmerizing and frightening and uplifting and breathtaking.  Read this book.  Now.  Go ahead, order it right now.
0684833395|4.0|This book came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. Catch-22  is weird, mixed up, irrational and bewildering, but totally sane. Some parts provoked thought, some parts provoked confusion, some parts provoked laughter, all parts were entertaining. I absolutely recommend it.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|Iron Man 2 3 disk combo, this review is on the disks quality not the movie: Package arrived fine, intact.  The regular DVD played fine.  The Blu-ray disk was defective, it would stop mid-play throughout the movie.  I must have gotten a bad-lot blu-ray disk.  Very annoying and disappointed :-(
0440242401|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors.  She creates heroines that you want to cheer for. Heroins that you can see apart of yourself in. Lexi is no different.  I think most women can say they have felt like the ugly unsuccessful girl that dreams of being the opposite that Lexi once was.  I enjoyed reading Lexi's adventure to find her old self in her new life.
B00020HEG6|4.0|This is a fantastic score, however, I only give it 4 stars because one of the minor themes used throughout the film is missing.  Has ANYONE else noticed?  It plays a number of times during the film, generally revolving around the Marauder's Map being used, Peter Pettigrew, and the Shrieking Shack.  I'm terribly disappointed that this was not included on the album, but despite that, it is still a great album.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book.  Not one to archive any time soon.  The twists and turns of the story keep you face stuck to your Kindle until the progress bar shows 100.  But then you want more.  One of those that you think you know but have no idea
B003EYVXXW|4.0|Agora is a dramatic depiction of what happened to Hypatia, the highly intelligent non-Christian Greek scholar from Alexandria, Egypt who was considered the first notable woman in mathematics.     An agora was an open place of assembly in ancient Greek city-states. This movie focuses on the agora in the area of the Serapeum in Alexandria, Egypt around 391 CE. The Serapeum, as presented in this movie, is incredibly well done. It's as though you were actually stepping back in time to see how it actually looked. The actors, the sets, and the entire production come together well and give the movie an authentic feel. This film truly has the feel of going back into time.     By NO MEANS am I stating that the movie \\"Agora\\" is 100% realistic. I am well aware that this is a typical Hollywood movie and I am also aware that NO movie is going to be 100% historically accurate. That being said, the movie \\"Agora\\" does get the big picture right and some details wrong. It's a movie. It was made to make money. I know that dramatic liberties were taken and I expect that. But, as long as the general story is told correctly then I don't mind some historical inaccuracies.     The Serapeum in Alexandria was destroyed by a Christian crowd in 391. The Serapeum housed part of the Great Library. The Serapeum in Alexandria did house a collection of writings that were a part of the Great Library. Now, the movie \\"Agora\\" shows Christian mobs destroying the Great Library at Alexandria. This, in truth, was most likely just a smaller housing of writings instead of the actual Great Library. There was a fire near the library in 47 BCE when Julius Caesar and the Roman armies conquered Egypt but there is no evidence that this destroyed the entire library and Caesar certainly never mentioned anything about completely burning down the greatest library in ancient history. A fire in the harbor most likely wouldn't have reached and burned down the entire library.     Suetonius, writing around 125 CE, says that the Emperor Domitian (reigning from 81 to 96 CE) used Alexandrian scholars to replace texts from Augustus' library at Palatine after a fire. It is entirely plausible that some portion of the Great Library continued to exist for many years and that there was a sister library of writings located at the Serapeum in Alexandria where the movie \\"Agora\\" takes place. Regardless of whether or not it was the actual Great Library or just a smaller collection of writings, it is sad to watch. All those philosophical, scientific, mathematical, and other literature destroyed by an ignorant mob who considered anything against their god to be pagan and therefore in need of being destroyed.     Hypatia taught philosophy and astronomy. Her contributions to science are reputed to include the charting of celestial bodies and the invention of the hydrometer which is used to determine the relative density and gravity of liquids. In the movie, she is shown with an incessant quest for knowledge concerning the world around her and not accepting any god for an answer. The real Hypatia was not an atheist and she was not a pagan either in the sense of worshipping many different gods. She devoted her entire life to the study of great thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato, Aristarchus, etc. In the movie she is shown as investigating the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos. This might not have been historically accurate but was most likely used as part of the movie to make it more interesting. There was no evidence that she actually studied the heliocentric model of the solar system. But, the movie does get it right that she was an avid astronomer and she had many students who would come from all over to be taught by her.     The movie Agora focuses on Hypatia's final years. Hypatia is played extremely well by actress Rachel Weisz. One thing that must be said is that Rachel Weisz is much too young to have played Hypatia at this stage in her life. In reality, she was around 60 years old. But, Rachel Weisz is much nicer to look at than perhaps a 60 year old actress so I can see why she was chosen to play the part. My favorite two lines from her in this movie are where, at one point, one of her inquisitors says that Hypatia does not believe in anything concerning religion and she states: \\"I believe in philosophy. \\" Later on when a Christian demands that she must be baptized and that she must consider herself among the Christians, she says to this Christian, \\"You don't question what you believe, I must..\\" You have to admire this woman for defying the ignorant piety of the times to stand up for what scientific knowledge she had.     The movie does a really good job of creating the contentious condition surrounding Orestes and Cryil, who were played brilliantly by the actors in this movie. All the actors in Agora are really talented. Hypatia was believed to have been the reason for the strained relationship between the governor of Alexandria, Orestes and the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Orestes and Cyril clashed. Both of these men were Christians but Orestes would allow the support of pagans and Jews. Cyril detested pagans and Jews. Problems occurred when Cyril and the church interfered with the secular authority of Orestes but this is really not developed too deeply in the movie. There are a few different spins on how events developed between Orestes and Cyril in the movie but nothing far fetched at all. In fact, everything appears extremely realistic at all times. History records that Orestes was angered with Cyril for interfering with secular issues and Cryil was angered that Orestes did not accept reconciliatory attempts made by him. There were other issues involving the Jews and pagans as well. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital. This is really not explained well before the Christian mob takes her to be killed.     That brings me to the death of Hypatia. There is no denying that she was brutally murdered and that Christians did it. That absolutely remains a black spot on the record of early Christianity. The film Agora presents her death in a lot more subtle manner than what actually transpired. In this film, her former slave does her the honorable duty of suffocating her before the mob gets to her. In actuality, she was stripped naked, brutally sliced up with shards of shell, cut into pieces, and then burned. That would have made for an extremely gruesome scene indeed in this movie. But we get a toned down version. We have accounts on what truly happened to her. This is truly one of the most awful historical atrocities committed by ancient Christians. This woman, Hypatia, was a beautiful scientific mind that was ruthlessly wiped out by the fervent religious ignorance of that time. Socrates Scholasticus writes in the 400s CE;     \\"Some of them therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home, and dragging her from her carriage, they took her to the church called Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her by scraping her skin off with tiles and bits of shell. After tearing her body in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.\\"     Agora is truly a remarkable film that I would highly recommend. It's like stepping back into time and experiencing a piece of history that should not be ignored. Although it is not completely accurate in regards to history (NO film is) it still gets the big picture right in the fact that Hypatia was a brilliant mind, she taught many students in Alexandria, she was believed to be the cause ofstrained relations between Orestes and Cyril, and she was brutally murdered by Christians in 415 CE. The dark age of ignorance would soon follow this atrocity and would again repeat itself with the likes of Giordano Bruno and Galileo during the Italian (Roman) Inquisition.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I storyline was pretty good, nothing that would make you roll your eyes throughout. This one is the best Step Up with an actual storyline, if you would rather watch more dancing then check out Step Up 2 the Streets or Step Up 3D. Those have amazing dance scenes.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love this tv series.  I've never watched it on tv, but started by buying season 1 and now season 6 has started.  This is season 5.  The characters are very entertaining, sometimes funny, sometime serious, and sometimes scarey!  If you have any doubt, at least buy season 1 and see how it all begins.

1453827145|4.0|Although we all know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, you don't really know it until you read it.  I was surprised to find out how different reading the book was compared to the various TV and popular portrayals.  It's somewhat along the lines of Frankenstein and Dracula although not quite as dark.  It's an intriguing story but also carries an underlying moral.  The moral focuses on the good and bad parts of human nature.  The part that we allow to grow is the part that ultimately takes control.  For Dr. Jekyll, he allowed his bad nature (Hyde) to overpower his good nature (Jekyll) and eventually succumbed.  A quick and interesting read.
B003E48AYC|5.0|Well, this is an exelente product, I only had one doubt because I didn´t know if it would come with spanish language and even I call to customer service just to be told that it wasn´t in spanish.

B003XMWSSY|4.0|I found this book useful mainly in two areas. It helped me cut back on the overuse of descriptive terms and reinforced the \\"show don't tell\\" rule. Having only written non-fiction in the past and having no background in formal writing or the arts, I would say it's a useful book. But I can see how someone who already writes fiction might think it didn't add much to their knowledge.<br /><br />I enjoyed the passages and exercises that went along with the writing to practice the newly acquired or re-inforced writing skills.<br /><br />I would recommend it for anyone who like me is just getting into writing, especially writing fiction.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Episode 1, not so sure. Seemed like a bit of a tacky rip-of of 300. But the Raimi/Tapert connection was intriguing.  Episode 2, the content started to get on top of the style. Curious where and how they would take it.  Episode 3, shamelessly hooked. It started to feel like a guilty pleasure.  Episode 4, no longer guilty, just a pleasure.  Episode 5, and beyond. Increasingly entertaining, witty and often funny, more often touching. Days of Our Gladiator Lives.  Sadly, we can only wish Andy Whitfield well and that he makes a full recovery. Along with John Hannah's Scottish gladiator school owner, Andy gave the series warmth and heart and a commitment to his character and performance that transcended green screen, slo-mo and CGB.  Highly recommended. The DVD transfer is dazzling good, the BD even better.  An edit to note the sad passing of Andy Whitfield. RIP.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|This is actually not the fan I needed.  I have an Nvidia Ge Force 2 card that has a frameless 40mmx40mm cooling fan that was really noisy.  Since this fan was the closest to the size I needed, I took a chance.  The only problem was that this fan is 10mm thick and mounting it on the heat-sink would interfere with the adjacent PCI slot.  I used a coping saw to cut the corners and then the sides leaving the top frame and motor mounts.  That was enough to get the fan blades down into the card's heat-sink.  The noise is gone, the card doesn't burn your fingers, all is well.

B000BGH22W|4.0|Harry Potter sequel rus in my house every so often. Its nice having all the DVD, from beginning to end and on Amazon, the used copies are as good as the new copies. (I don't often buy new DVD).
B002OOG6YY|4.0|First of all, I should say that I'm extremely happy to have this concert documented in full, unlike the DVD version which is cobbled together from various concerts.  This was a fantastic concert - I know because I was there.  It took place at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, and it wasn't really advertised as part of the tour.  In fact, I remember finding out about it in some offhand manner, and it felt sort of a like a secret show just for fans.  As you can see from the video, the place wasn't packed to the rafters, but it was definitely full.  And the crowd was very enthusiastic.  One of the other reviewers felt that the noise of the crowd had been dubbed in, and although I can't prove him wrong, I can definitely say that there was a roar.  With properly placed microphones, I'm sure they could have recorded it, maybe pumped it up a bit.  As to his comments on the lack of women in the audience in spite of their presence on the soundtrack, I can say that there were lots of them at the show, less so on the floor so maybe the microphones were placed in the balconies.  I did find a bootleg audio recording of the show, and the women could definitely be heard.    Now, here's the bad news: the crowd may or may not have been dubbed, but Manson's vocals definitely were.  And poorly.  Not in the sense that he didn't sound good, but that the syncing was off.  At times, a note would extend after he put the microphone down, and at other times, full lines were sung with the microphone at his side or held out to the audience.  I found it somewhat distracting, but maybe others wouldn't even notice.  I don't remember him sounding bad at the concert, and the bootleg bears this out.  I can only guess that there was a problem with the audio, and perhaps this is why the original DVD was cut together from several concerts.    The good news is that if you can get past the dubbing, it is a great representation of a Manson concert when he was still in his prime.  It looks fantastic on a 52\\" HDTV and, dubbing aside, sounds great (through headphones, that is - I don't think the neighbors would appreciate it at the volume I'm accustomed to).  It's a must for fans and also for anyone wondering what all the fuss was about.  He might not be your cup of tea, but he is a great performer with songs that actually mean something (this album/tour came out right after he was blamed for the Columbine massacre, and he deftly places the blame where it truly belongs - on gun-obsessed Christian society).  I would have given it five stars if not for the dubbing issue.
B000056HE9|4.0|I've only seen this movie over the past few years but it's become one of my favorite Christmas movies.  Great actors!  Great story.  A real feel good movie.  It's in black and white, but the quality is very good.  My only problem is the box it's in.  It looks like something that's been printed at home.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was emotionally prepared for this movie and still I cried like a baby all the way through. All movies whether good or bad have moments in them that are high marks or passing scenes which are branded in memory. Hachi, for me has that moment- Everytime Professor Parker returned Hachi to his little backyard shed he would peek through the crooked wood pickets and simply---- look up to see his master and just look. We as the audience would see Hachis eye looking up. Oh that short scene just got to me. The entire movie transcends the boy and his dog (man and his dog) relationship to a spiritual one of total oneness. Hachi loved his master so much he that he never ever gave up waiting for his arrival. He was in fact waiting for him too in Heaven of course as we see at the end. This film is for all people period. Such a fine piece of movie making. I am glad Lasse H. directed as he was the perfect choice. This movie should be rated A for ALL Audiences!!! Boy if we could only treat each other with such loyalty, love and devotion the world would be......... But thats a different movie. Hachi- The movie that shows our four pawed companions love us to the end and will wait for us to return for all eternity!!! A Great Great movie!!!!!
B001ARYYPY|5.0|This is one of Julia Robert's best--a well acted, well directed, well edited representation of the conflict between PG&E and the victims of its corporate greed and that company's indifference to the plight of its customers--caused by its actions (as well as inaction).  I think Albert L. Finney does a bang up job as Edward L. Masry (the lawyer who hires Brockovich), but all the characters do great work.  A story with substance and pathos.    The only reason I have not already bought the Bluray version is that I will not be an accessory to crime, and some flaming retard thinking that he/she can charge $99.98 for the Bluray version is just a criminal.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|SPLICE    I have to say that when this film first came out other than the crazy looking female in it I wasn't to into it. But of course tha changed when I actually got the chance to see it and my opinion turned around. Don't get me wrong I always wanted to see it but it was not a priority. This film actually turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, in fact I thought it would be just average. I was pleasantly surprise as I thought it was a great flick. Add in that Guillermo Del Toro had a hand in this and you have the potential for a great movie.    Two scientists who are also together work at a company pushing the limits of DNA research; in fact they have created a new species by splicing animal genes together. When they put the new animals together [one male and one female] things go pretty good. But they want to take it a bit farther and add in human DNA to their next project. That of course gives birth to a humanoid like creature they name Dren, which of course is nerd backwards. Clive and Elsa {Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley} have different points of view on this new life form. Elsa views Dren as a daughter and wants to care for her while Clive wants the subject gone, but the views they each have change hands as Dren gets older.    I thought this was absolutely a brilliant film especially the first ¾'s of the film, the ending kinda went down a bit but it was still good. But everything before that was brilliant because Dren really did come off as a human female child. Going threw all the emotions and changes a girl would in real life. It is in this that the relationship between the three elevates this movie in my eyes. Things do get a little crazy here but I was kinda into it mainly because it felt real to me, I thought it moved along pretty good.    Of course the ending of the film while good could have been better in my opinion and some scenes needed a boast. But I did like the performances here from our lead cast, now they did much better in the relationship scenes more so than the scientist scenes but oh well. Adrien Brody did a great job here as did Sarah Polley especially in anything that involved Dren. Of course it was great seeing my boy David Hewlett here even if he wasn't the star, Simona Maicanescu, and Brandon McGibbon were also good here. But it was Abigail Chu as child Dren and Delphine Chaneac as adult Dren that stole the show; they both did a great job.    Director Vincenzo Natali along with fellow writers Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor did a great job here for the most part. The story is straight forward and not hard to follow at all but it is still compelling. Now to be honest it is Dren and the performances of the two that played her that really carried this film but all did a great job. There are flaws like with all things but I really liked this one for some reason. I think it is because I waited for the DVD release and had time to let hype die down. So I went into this with out any high expectations and I came out liking it.    I do recommend this film but hit up a rental first because some people will most likely not like this. In fact some people may hate some of the things that happen in this flick, I loved it. When you watch you will know what parts I am talking about, I am sure some already do know. Over all this was much better than I thought it would be.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|I just love Glee and was thrilled when my daughter asked for it for her birthday.  I came late to watching Glee and had to rent it in between other dvds that were more to my husbands taste.  My daughter had me over to her place to watch the last four first season episodes I hadn't seen.  The series is so different, so creative, so addictive.  When I want to treat myself, I savor an episode I've saved from this season. Watch it once , and you won't want to quit!

0312600844|5.0|\\"Freedom\\" opens with gossip, neighbors about neighbors, and goes on to read like wickedly smart and addictive gossip for several hundred pages about people I don't know or necessarily like, but it's so much fun to be in on the scoop.  It's delicious gossip, astute, contextual and cool enough that it rings true but doesn't evoke compassion--it's not stressful.  It's mainly head, not much heart.      Then about page 300 the narrative starts to deepen as we get more inside two of the characters, Richard and also Joey, who are operating--not so much from the head or the heart but from the groin.  It's interesting that sex is the highest expression of intimacy in this novel and presents the only escape from abstract, heady obsessions and depressions.  It's all really fascinating stuff.  Oddly, the women remain opaque, even the central character, Patty.  Her mix of traits and behaviors never quite comes together as a real person.  Abject submission seems too important to the happiness of the main women characters, excepting one, whose fate defeats her.  The more peripheral women are lonely weirdos.    Yet I love the political astuteness and perspective in \\"Freedom\\" which makes it a very gratifying read with some deeply valuable information and ideas.  I absolutely agree with Walter about overpopulation and hope this book is read by millions in our overpopulated world.    Finally, in the last 100 pages there are two or three very moving scenes and at last emotionality--connection--stirs the heart.

B003Q6D282|3.0|I'll keep this review simple, since it is after all the seventh film in the SAW series. Since 2004, I've made the trek to my local theater to see what Jigsaw had in store, but it's become more of a chore with each passing year. The first three movies were the best, but these last two are worthy sequels. I didn't care much for IV or V. The acting this time around is okay and story doesn't lag too much, but I have to say that the traps and gore level is probably the highest of all the films. If only the blood didn't look so cheap, with a noticeable pinkish hue, I think I would have had a harder time not turning away from the carnage. There are a couple of twists that I won't spoil, but the major one was predicted more than a few movies ago by most SAW fans. Still, it is pretty neat and will hopefully wrap up these movies for good.<br /><br />The 3-D wasn't really needed, but it did have a couple of body parts flying through the air moments to shine.

B000LC55F2|4.0|Plot: Clever idea to have two ways of doing the same trick. The rivalry between the two magicians was really something fierce.    Science: The teleporters in the story are different from the kind that physicists usually talk about. I can't say more without ruining the film for you.    Science Fiction: It was a brilliant idea to present Tesla as the inventor. He invented so many incredible things, that if a teleporter could be made at that time, then he's probably the one to do it.    Actors: Both Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine are among my favorite actors, and they did not disappoint me.    Clarity of presentation: Only a grade of B. After watching it twice I was still confused until I read the Wikipedia article on the film. There is also a Wikipedia article on the book it was made from. Both articles tell the plots, which are slightly different.

B0000AI45P|5.0|This is a great record of a great band. This is them at their best.<br /><br />Television seem related to other New York bands from the seventies - -the oblique poetry of the lyrics and even the delivery style is reminiscent of Patti Smith. In a vague way they hail from the arty guitar band tradition, the one that includes acts like the Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth, if only in their rawness and interest in the formal aspect of music. In some ways they heralded the ear of the D.I.Y. aesthetic, in contrast to the processed music that dominated the airwaves in the 70s. -- perhaps most noticeably in the vocals of Tom Verlaine, which were uncompromisingly personal and unafraid to display rough edges. But in other ways, they just didn't resemble anyone else.<br /><br />Punk hadn't been codified yet. The CBGBs scene from which Television emerged didn't really have a particular aesthetic. And so it could be that Television was all about personal poetry, elaborate arrangements, melodic guitar parts, big guitar solos , backup vocals and all sorts of other things later to be considered anathema to proper punks.<br /><br />There's a certain piquant eighth-note-ness to some of those soaring guitar lines, that keeps them from sounding like the well-oiled guitar solos of the mainsteam - a general air of slight reluctance to conform, even as rock is always some sort of celebration of certain clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />there's a certain predeliction for using simple, meaty chord changes, but then hanging so many hooks, melodic runs, rhythmic stops and starts, unexpected dissonances over them that you'd never suspect the whole song only had like four chords.<br /><br />Ah well. It happened. It will never happen quite this way again.

B001W6S0C6|5.0|The Movie<br /><br />Don't let this one fool you.  Michael Keaton may be wearing black Nikes and Jack Nicholson may be done up in white makeup and green hair, but this one is for real.  Nicholson is particularly masterful as the signature caper opposite the immortal caped crusader - \\"This town needs an enema!\\"  Batman is a classic and despite its age, a solid and memorable piece of filmmaking.  Where the Christopher Nolan envisioned Batman Begins and The Dark Knight feel as if it does occur in a real world, Tim Burton's Batman feels as if it takes place in its own universe.  That in itself is a compliment.  There is some real imagination at work here and this is probably the best movie Tim Burton will ever make.  Batman Returns definitely outdid Batman in some areas, notably in editing and production design.  But, Batman has a balanced script where our lead superhero doesn't have a cameo appearance in the villain shod sequel.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />This one holds water.  The transfer is vibrant and despite the occasional graininess, pretty sharp too.  Clean and simple cinematography drag the Dark Knight out of the gutter and into a bright High-Def presentation.  Color is vivid without being over-saturated.  Overall the film looks and feels natural.  Heck, even the pre-digital optical effects hold up for the most part.  The main casualty here is on the audio end of things.  Sound is clear but on the flat side, with surround mixing on the Tru-HD is a bit half-assed.  This is a mono track movie they dropped an occasional decibel to the rear speakers, but there's no real surround sound.

1401323952|5.0|Ordinarily I control my cookbook urges. With a collection of cookbooks that has overrun the available shelf space (cookbooks squished sideways on top of others, some spilling onto the floor, others taking over bookshelves originally allocated to \\"travel\\" or \\"history\\"), I. must. control. myself. I force myself to take a cookbook out of the library first, to ensure that I want to actually cook from it more than once. If a cookbook survives three recipes, I give myself permission to purchase it.<br /><br />Not Nigella's. The moment I saw this book was on sale, I pre-ordered it. Doing so was the right decision.<br /><br />Unlike some of her recent cookbooks, about [[ASIN:1401301363 Feasts]] or [[ASIN:1401323367 Christmas]] or [[ASIN:1401322433 Cooking Good Food, Fast]], this has less of a specific theme except maybe \\"comfort food meets your real-life frenetic schedule.\\" The first half of the book, called Kitchen Quandaries, leans toward serving your \\"dinner in 30 minutes\\" needs, with chapters like \\"Hurry up, I'm hungry\\" and \\"Off the cuff\\" (pantry suppers). The second, Kitchen Comforts, is full of recipes for when you're in the mood to chop and stir, segmented into chapters including \\"The solace of stirring\\" and \\"the bone collection.\\"<br /><br />Her recipes do not disappoint. (Well, they almost never DO disappoint, which is why I could order this book with such confidence.) So far, I've made two meals, both from the fast-food side of the book. \\"Lemony salmon with cherry tomato couscous\\" was quick to throw together but sure didn't taste that way; it was good as a cold salad, too, when I wanted lunch the next day. Her \\"speedy seafood supper\\" won't make me throw out my recipes for the putter-worthy cioppino, but it was 30 minutes from \\"What's for dinner?\\" to pouring the fish stew into a bowl and grabbing a hunk of bread. Even better, that recipe started with a pound of frozen mixed seafood from Trader Joe's; I didn't have to remember to defrost anything (a common \\"oh drat!\\" moment in this household). I'm making this week's shopping list now, and am trying to decide if I'll make her \\"spatchcocked Cornish hen\\" (with sultanas and pine nuts) or \\"pork and apple hotpot.\\" It might be both.<br /><br />Nigella includes a few extra features in this cookbook that I really appreciate. One is a chapter devoted to shortcuts and other things that make life a little easier. In many cases these are obvious tips, at least for someone who's been cooking for 30 years, but in this case I had a few, \\"Oh, I'll try that!\\" moments. (I had already learned from her TV shows how handy it is to use kitchen shears to cut up bacon or scallions directly into the pan; if that's all you need to cut up, why dirty a knife and cutting board?) Plus, she has a very good balance between recipes that feed 6-8 and those that serve one or two.<br /><br />Another thing I like is that she has a postscript to many recipes that tell you what you can do with the leftovers. Some leftovers are intentional, of course, such as poaching chicken with the goal of turning leftovers into one of the chicken salads she suggests. Others, though, answer my \\"What the heck do I do with THIS?\\" questions, such as her suggestion to turn leftover Risotto Bolognese into \\"risotto burgers\\" with cheese melted on top, served with peas. I wish more cookbooks did this.<br /><br />This cookbook has already earned its spot on the cookbook shelves, and I've had it for only a week. I expect you'll feel the same way.

B00004Y7SG|1.0|This one is truly bad. If this is her kind of Christmas, I'll take Hannukah instead. Might be OK if you are having a holiday dance party, but CDs produced on the cheap really annoy me. Even the jacket is but one page, with neither credits nor production notes (Which only serves to protect the guilty.) Thankfully, I wrote this review a year ago and saved it, so I would not have to listen to this screeching again. (Review of the CD, not the cassette.)
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Growing up in Toronto and following this band and then watching this movie brought a lot of memories back. The music, the history and the unique personalities of the band. Great backstage pass you can never get anywhere else!!!
B002NHBNWW|5.0|For whom ever said vampire stories were just for amateurs and young adults got it all wrong.  This is not Dawson's Creek.  This is not one of the Scream movies.  This is a show that shines different elements into place and Kevin Williamson is a genius for bringing these elements alive.  Each episode keeps getting better and better and I hope there are more seasons to come.  Sure, the first 4 episodes of the first season were somewhat bleak and played out like episodes of the \\"new\\" 90210, but as the episodes played on, revelations of each character begin to reveal itself.  The story is about Elena, a beautiful young teenage mortal girl caught between 2 handsome vampire brothers, Stefan (the supposed good brother) and Damon (the supposed evil brother), that both love her, but ultimately know she can only choose one of them.  And this show is not just about a love triangle or vampires and werewolves competing for territory.  It's about a human history expanding almost 150 years and the different people who have surrounded each of the 3 main characters and ultimately, how it affects the outcome of each chapter in their lives.  The Twilight Sagas never understood this and that is why there was no depth in their storylines...just a bunch of wanna-be teenagers memorizing lines and being told how to act by a seemingly clueless (and different) director each time.  With The Vampire Diaires, this is not the case.  Each actor selected for their individual roles are just perfect in so many ways.  The acting is brilliant and believable and a big standing ovation to Ian Somerhalder who is not only one of the 3 leads, but truly shines as the star of the show.  It is because of him, the show really takes off to new heights and his character, Damon Salvatore, can either be loved or loathed at any moment or time.  With each episode, one only hopes he will win Elena's heart because slowly, but surely he evolves as a better individual due to her positive impact upon him.  There are such strong elements in the storyline and so much depth in each character that I can not imagine a better Vampire story being told at the moment than the Vampire Diaries.strong elements in the storyline and so much depth in each character that I can not imagine a better Vampire story being told at the moment than the Vampire Diaries.
B0042JTAI8|4.0|A rundown castle, tightly held family secrets and a literary mystery lie at the center of this novel. Throw in a long lost letter, forbidden romance, family madness and ghostly whispers in the dark and you get a gothic style mystery which would be the perfect book to read by the fire on a stormy night.<br /><br />The book kicks off in 1992 when a letter posted during the war arrives for Meredith Burchill. For the first time, her daughter Edie learns that her mother was evacuated from London for 18 months during World War 2. Meredith spent that time living in Milderhurst Castle in Kent, home to the famous writer Raymond Blythe and his three daughters. Blythe's claim to fame is that he penned a book which became a children's classic: The True History of the Mud Man. This also happens to be Edie's favorite book. Edie visits the castle and meets with the three daughters, now elderly ladies. She has an unnerving encounter with the youngest daughter, Juniper, which makes her realize that there are some dark family secrets which her mother may be a part of. Why have the sisters never left the castle? What had tormented Raymond Blythe in his final years? Is Juniper's madness purely because her fiance jilted her 40 years previously? Why was Raymond Blythe so secretive about the origins of his book?<br /><br />The story then jumps back to 1941, and from there it moves between the past and the present day. Kate Morton does a skillful job of gradually peeling back layers of the onion, so that the true story is gradually pieced together over the course of the book. What this does mean however it that it takes quite a while to get going. The early chapters have a lot of background information which takes a while to become relevant. There are several mysteries to be revealed, and while I was able to guess at some of them, I was completely wrong about others. Morton also does a terrific job of bringing the forbidding castle to life. There are a few genuinely creepy moments, although for the most part it's intriguing rather than chilling.<br /><br />I tossed up between 3 and 4 stars. At times I felt that the book was overlong, too contrived and reliant on coincidences. However the way it comes together is ultimately very satisfying. A good story, cleverly told.art it's intriguing rather than chilling.    I tossed up between 3 and 4 stars. At times I felt that the book was overlong, too contrived and reliant on coincidences.

B0045NDVFE|5.0|This band just floored me. I mean they are absolutely jaw-dropping, consciousness-changing awesome. When I first heard \\"If I Die Young\\" I was driving to work and had to stop to compose myself - me, who scored 17 out of 80 on the empathy test. Still can't hear it without welling up.<br />And there's not a bad track here. Wonderful, poetic lyrics with sometimes startlingly fresh images, and yet not a four letter word to be found - are you listening, Katy Perry, etc.? \\"You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store\\", \\"I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger\\", \\"Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure that she sees\\", \\"When I first laid eyes on you/well, the night just felt so odd/You looked at me and the stars lined up/so I thought I'd heard from God\\" - I could go on. Funny, sassy, thought-provoking, touching words. Kimberly has, simply, an angel's voice and flawless phrasing. They have the kind of harmonies you can only get with family. All with just-right instrumentals and appropriately driving rhythms.<br />Most of us have to work and practice, practice, practice to make good music. These Perrys seem to be the other sort, who have music in their DNA, or in the water. They just get it somehow. I'm glad they chose to share with the rest of us.

B000002J1F|5.0|My first exposure to Yes was the three record Yessongs from the 73 tour. It took a little bit of time to get used to their style at first but I was always of the opinion that all forms of genuine creativity require to some degree that the listener adjust to the style of the artist rather than the artist adjusting his style to fit the public's taste. In other words all innovators in music seem unusual at first until you catch on to the originality of that artist. It may take someone a bit to understand something that is out of the ordinary or a little off the beaten path. Yes music is innovative and definitely a very unique style.<br />This is one of their classic albums containing what are by now classic songs: \\"Roundabout\\", \\"Heart of The Sunrise\\", \\"Mood For Day\\", \\"Long Distance Runaround\\". The other track are probably lesser known but equally enjoyable. This albums is actually quite short which is good since it doesn't get boring. There is a pretty even balance of songwriting and intrumental skills here so that one doesn't seem to overshadow the other. This is also an early example of progressive rock. Obviously this isn't my first time hearing this and probably not for others. If you like Yes you are already like me familiar with this and even some of the obscure cuts seems interesting. If you don't like Yes well ... there's not much point of reading this.<br />I am a guitarist and I have the songbook of this album - check out sheetmusicplus.com which only serves to enhance my enjoyment and appreciation of this album. I often find it satisfying to play along with the songs on this album, which are challenging to any guitarists' playing and sight reading abilities. Steve Howe is still outstanding in evey way and this album freely demonstrates this.<br />This is a classic album and by now you probably already know what you think of it. I also should mention that this was brought on Amazon for an irresistable price.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I saw this back when it first came out. Was working as a security guard at the theater that was playing the movie. I thought it was going to be stupid. I fell in love with the movie. Tim Curry is the best. Rent, buy it just see and u will agree.
0375842209|5.0|This novel blew me away. It took a little time for me to get used to the narration and the format, including the asides by Death, but it is extremely lyrical and the characters are wonderfully developed. I have no idea why this is classified as \\"young adult fiction.\\" I'm 36 years old, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. The main characters are pre-teens, but the storyline is definitely NOT juvenile. This is a GREAT book! Its uniqueness was a welcome change. Read it and you'll agree!
0307266303|5.0|This was a great book with an interesting and inspiring story.  It was also an inspirational book that encourages one to rethink their approach to running.

B0046F5V40|1.0|The original Nikita was cool. The Nikita with Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis was very, very cool. This Nikita is so far below those productions that it seems very amateurish , like it was put together  by a junior high school class as a film project. After watching for a half hour, I had to quit . I felt nothing for any of the characters, and was kind of hoping they would all shoot each other and it would finally be over. I don't write many reviews ,but if I can save just one innocent person from the anguish of watching this video I know that Heaven will reward me.

0385737947|1.0|\\"The Maze Runner\\" is a young adult adventure story set sometime in the future. It also has an element of mystery. Since the characters were all boys (except for one girl who didn't play an active role until near the end), the target audience appears to be teen boys. The suspense mainly came from the physical danger to the characters, but it also came from the lack of memories and the mystery of the maze. This book is the first in a trilogy, and it's a fast read.<br /><br />The characters were varied, and they had their strengths and weaknesses and their emotional ups and downs. Even the \\"bad\\" kids had good reasons for their actions. I mainly kept reading because I wanted to know what was going on, but I also liked how Thomas, Minho, and Newt played off each other. Thomas had a needed fresh perspective and heroic selflessness, but he wouldn't have succeeded without Newt's insistence on order and Minho's discipline.<br /><br />However, I didn't like the ending. At all. The story started out as brave, determined kids working together to outwit the evil adults who put them in the maze. But near the end, we're told the very sick reason that they were put there (though the reasoning seemed illogical). The adults were deliberately trying to break the kids by taking away their hope. They wanted the kids to give up and die, and they were deliberately killing off all but a \\"top\\" few. The ending was very violent and bloody. Two main characters were killed, one of them likely to be a favorite of the reader (though I liked them both). Also, Thomas started off caring and noble and ended up broken and hate-filled. Things don't get better, they get worse. Not my kind of book.<br /><br />I also didn't find the climatic maze battle exciting. Thomas was supposed to be focused on doing his part and doing it as quickly as possible since it would end the killing that was going on. Instead he took in every little bloody detail of the killing going on. There was no need to spend so much time on it. I felt frustrated and angry at Thomas and Teresa instead of worried about them. By the end, I felt like throwing the book at a wall.<br /><br />There was a very minor amount of explicit bad language and a lot of totally made-up bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this novel.ted and angry at Thomas and Teresa instead of worried about them. By the end, I felt like throwing the book at a wall.

068484267X|4.0|I randomly came across this book while browsing memoirs here on Amazon and immediately added it to my wish list! The book took me a lot longer to read then i thought it would, because i was constantly falling in and out of love with it (so to speak.) There were parts in the book that (coming from a mothers point of view) just ripped me to pieces.. and made me want to read more and more... and other parts that made me want to put it down and leave it for a while. At some points as i moved forward in the book, i felt as if i were re-reading the previous chapters.. only every once in a whlie was something new and exciting added. Overall the book was great! It made me very thankful to be surrounded by such caring family and friends.. and have a roof over my head and food in my belly. The ending was abrupt.. but there's a sequel, that i have already added to my wish list.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Karate Kid    The first Karate Kid is a favorite of ours, so when we saw this new version we could not wait to see the sequel.    Jaden Smith; Will Smith's son does a remarkable job as the young man who is moved out of his element only to realize that the change will transform him into a man.      In his home town of Detroit, Dre Parker lived in tranquility, surrounded by friends, family and neighbors, a popular kid who says goodbye to it all as he follows his mother to China where she has been relocated by her employer.    As soon as he arrives he makes a friend who invites him to play in the park. There he meets Mei Ying and falls for her. They go to the same school and while this makes Dre Parker very happy, it makes a gang of local bullies jealous and soon this young kid gets into all sorts of trouble.    Cultural differences are a challenge to us all, but Dre must face his enemies on a daily basis at school. As with the first movie, he wants to go back home because he is a fish out of water, but through a friend played by Jackie Chan, Mr. Han teaches him the art of self defense, and as Dre masters Kung fu, he learns to defend himself, confronting his fears with great courage.    The scenery is simply gorgeous, the awareness that kung fu is not about fighting but about learning to control the self, developing great inner strength to face challenges with great serenity leave us all desirous of learning the same lessons.     Without a doubt, this is a magnificent movie, worth seeing. Don't miss it!
B002JIEYKS|4.0|This one is full of good hard rock songs that are not in the least occult related. The band was trying something new and the songs are more enjoyable here than on 'technical ecstacy' by a long shot.  The band was coming apart at the time,  but the playing and singing are excellent. IT's far different in style though than their classic earlier cd's and that threw off some fans at the time. But songs like &quot; never say die' are still very good metal songs and that's enough for me. The dvd of a live show from this period is also excellent.  Worth owning for metal , hard rock fans and that's why I say 'never say die' is a worthy sidestep in this bands career. But  it's not classic metal like their first 6 cd's to be sure. (or the dio years either) but it's well worth owning.  and 'never say die' was a hit single.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Not your traditional romantic comedy, for sure.  It's a good mix of drama and comedy, with a couple of interesting twists that force the characters to reach inside themselves and question who they are and what they want to become.  It's a movie I wanted to see more than once.
B000O59AFW|2.0|Missin Impossible is about a GROUP of agents who fight the enemies of freedom, criminals, and drug dealers etc. This movie is the second one to feature a lone agent fighting american traitors.  snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  It looks better on blu ray but I had to sell this after I watched it because it's just a bad movie.  Imo, tom cruise is actually a good actor, he was great in several movies too but this series is just another bad secret agent movie which can't even find decent villians to fight.  Hollywood made money on this one because cruise was in it but most people will not like this flick after they see it. Why not come up with villians we can relate too? evil madmen , cults, evil drug gangs, communists , far right fanatics, muslim or other relgious fanatics. but not another evil agent flick.

B003EYVXUK|5.0|Comparisons to the Swedish version of this film, \\"Let the Right One In\\", are inevitable; as much as we try to avoid them, it's next to impossible.  That being said, my rating of 5 stars is not, in any way, a reflection of how well the American remake (this IS a remake, afterall) tracks to the original.  Rather, it's based on how it stands on its own.    By now, you get the picture.  Owen, a disenfranchised youth in a somewhat hopeless existence is picked on mercilessly by local bullies.  Abby, a girl who only comes out at night and walks in the snow with bare feet, moves in next door with what appears to be her father.  People start dying while Owen, a 12 year old boy, develops a crush on his new neighbor.  Abby's \\"father\\" warns her to stay away, but she gives in to her new friend, seemingly longing for attention, for companionship.  With Abby's encouragement, Owen learns to fight back and stand on his own 2 feet.    The cinematography of this film is a refreshing departure from the somewhat ADHD-ish American films of late; fast moving, mockumentary camera work is seemingly the norm these days.  I don't necessarily mind it if the film warrants that method (The Hurt Locker), but it has become passé and overdone.  \\"Let Me In\\" is refreshing in that the camera languishes on characters and lets you really \\"see\\" them, rather than ripping away too fast or bouncing around.  You get enough time to take it all in and process what you're seeing.  This type of camera work was also necessary to accurately track with the pacing of the film.    Everyday life is not a sequence of car crashes, explosions, and super human fight scenes, especially when you're talking about the everyday lives of those who have given up hope.  The apartment complex Owen and his mother live in is such a place - a prison-like dwelling of people who have given in to hopelessness, to a meaningless existence.  The best way to portray this is exactly what this film does: to pace it slowly, as if it's simplyplodding along without joy and hope.  Using that method sets the mood for the audience and punctuates the scenes of absolute horror even more.  The everyday dullness and drudgery of the character's lives was depicted masterfully by this pacing.  The only complaint I have (and this is where a comparison of the is inevitable) is that the Swedish version did a slightly better job of it.    One of the most refreshing discoveries of this film was how closely it tracks to our understanding of vampires: they need blood, they can't eat regular food, they can't enter a dwelling without being invited, they explode into flames in sunlight, and they are incredibly strong.  There's neither twinkling in the sun nor surprise appearances in the human love interest's bedroom.  In fact, when Abby walks into Owen's apartment uninvited, the result is incredibly powerful.    ** SPOILER ALERT! **    In the original Swedish version, Eli is shown changing after a shower to wash off the blood caused by entering Oskar's apartment uninvited.  Eli is shot naked from the back before she puts on a dress.  In the American remake, Abby walks into a room and Owen \\"spies\\" on her through the open door.  His reaction is enough to indicate a young boy's pubescent interest in the other sex.  Some have complained that Americans are prudes and this change undermines the remake, but I believe that criticism to be misguided and a bit sophomoric.  The director understands a naked 12 year old girl is taboo camera material to an American audience, reeking a little of child porn.  The Swedish sensibilities are very different, it seems.  Director Matt Reeves deftly gets the point across without alienating the audience.    ** END OF SPOILER ALERT! **    The reason why this movie will appeal to the more intelligent film viewer is this: it doesn't insult us.  There's plenty of gore, mind you, but there's also plenty that's portrayed off camera or in the shadows, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.  You're left to fill in the blanks and not be spoon fed by the director's vision of what he thinks it should look like.  As an example, a sequence shot to perfection is the pool scene; there's an enormous amount of gore, but it's portrayed via Owen's underwater viewpoint.  We clearly get the picture, but the visual is left for the viewer to fill in, a refreshing change.  A long, languishing, distant pull back of the scene is perfect to help anchor our understanding of what just happened.    This film stands on its own as one of my top 5 films and one of the best films of the year.  While I tried hard not to compare it to the original, I will say that the Swedish version was marginally better, but not by much.  The bleak portrayal of the apartment complex in the original edged out this remake ever so slightly.  You really need to see both.  They are that good.
1593272790|5.0|If you or someone you know is interested in expanding their LEGO building techniques or is seeking inspiration to build like a professional, this three book series is the answer.    While every book in the series is great, The Fantastic Contraptions book is the best stand-alone book as there's something in it for every LEGO builder.  Isogawa offers up ideas for building with lights, magnets, pneumatic elements, pulleys and more.    Similar to the LEGO idea books from the 70's and 80's, these books are chock full of clever creations, but instead of specifically describing how to build things like houses, spaceships or vehicles, this series of books takes creativity to an even higher level by teaching the reader how to build foundational components that can be used to build practically anything.      Using full color photo illustrations and an intuitive icon-based index system, you can quickly find how to build mechanical walkers, automatic sliding doors, flexible vehicles, and much more.    These books contain virtually no words beyond the first few pages, but this is no problem thanks to Isogawa's carefully arranged photographs that indicate where to place every piece.    Novice builders wishing to learn how to connect bricks in unique and interesting ways such as sideways, upside down or at angles will particularly enjoy the Simple Machines book, whereas Mindstorms robotics fans and LEGO Technic fans will enjoy the entire series.     Whereas the titles of these books aptly describe the bias towards technical creations, all three books should be on the shelf of every serious LEGO fan.
030726999X|5.0|The sad, violent saga of Lisbeth Salander is brought to an ambiguous end here in the final book of Larsson's Millenium Trilogy. Thankfully it really is the best in the series, as it ties everything together from the previous books while having enough new characters and tension to make it a fine book on its own. No other book moves so quickly, goes as deeply into the politics of the author's beloved Sweden, has so much at risk, and has as much fun with the cat-and-house aspects of the story as this one. Salander, even though confined here through the great majority of the book, is as brilliantly crafty as she's ever been, and further cements her place as a truly interesting character in modern-day fiction. Everything from the characterization to the prolonged sense of danger to the wonderful atmosphere to the brilliant plotting and imagination of the book is first-rate, and goes far beyond what is found so often in dime-a-dozen thrillers these days. Highly recommended for all readers, though you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you skip to this one without reading the first two.
1593272782|5.0|If you or someone you know is interested in expanding their LEGO building techniques or is seeking inspiration to build like a professional, this three book series is the answer.    I give the entire series of books five stars and the \\"Wheeled Wonders\\" book is worth a special mention as it covers just about every facet of LEGO mechanical motion.  Although you will need a robust collection of LEGO motor parts to perfectly replicate Isogawa's suggestions, take note that this is an IDEA book, and even with a small amount of gears, wheels and motors you can have a lot of fun learning from this LEGO master.    Similar to the LEGO idea books from the 70's and 80's, this book series is chock full of clever creations, but instead of specifically describing how to build things like houses, spaceships or vehicles, these books take creativity to an even higher level by teaching the reader how to build foundational components that can be used to build practically anything.      Using full color photo illustrations and an intuitive icon-based index system, you can quickly find how to build mechanical walkers, automatic sliding doors, flexible vehicles, and much more.    These books contain virtually no words beyond the first few pages, but this is no problem thanks to Isogawa's carefully arranged photographs that indicate where to place every piece.    Novice builders wishing to learn how to connect bricks in unique and interesting ways such as sideways, upside down or at angles will particularly enjoy the Simple Machines book, whereas Mindstorms robotics fans and LEGO Technic fans will enjoy the entire series due to the frequent use of gears and beams to achieve startling results.    Whereas the titles of these books aptly describe the bias towards technical creations, all three books should be on the shelf of every serious LEGO fan.
0312600844|3.0|I love great writing, and Franzen is, at the very least one of the top twenty-five fiction writers working today, and \\"FREEEDOM\\" is great writing. Sadly I have read the story before - several hundred times, including \\"CORRECTIONS\\". Great writing needs originality to keep me interested. Dull characters doing exactly what the reader expects them to do is boring no matter how clever the turn of phrase, the use of imagery is. If you have yet to read a Franzen novel, this will satisfy somewhat, otherwise move on to more creative books.

B001S86J5S|5.0|This movie has long been a \\"classic\\" in our house. There are few movies that I enjoy seeing repeatedly, but this one has to be watched at least once a year! And now, in BluRay! It's the greatest!  If you've never seen Charlie Sheen as the \\"Wild Thing,\\" or the look on Tom Berenger's face when he accidentally walks into the middle of his ex-girlfriend's fiancee's dinner party, you've really missed out! And Blu-Ray adds even greater specifics to this terrific show.

B003Y58CKS|5.0|I began to watch this DVD with bated breath, that is, until I heard the singers sing.  Each one is superb.  I especially wondered how Juan Diego Florez would fare as the Duke of Mantua, but once he started singing, I breathed easily land enjoyed the show.  Both Florez and Diana Damrau brought their bel canto expertise and superb vocalism to the service of Verdi's music.  The Rigoletto, Zeljko Lucic, ran the gamut from tenderness with his Gilda to thundering fury with everyone else.  I also liked the production.  At first, when Rigoletto was putting on his grease paint during the overture, I was afraid that it might be a typical \\"Euro-trash\\" production, with a bit of warmed over I Pagliacci. But the sets and dramatic action really served the music and libretto.  I would have to say that I came to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the story and characters as a result of seeing this performance.  Rigoletto doesn't get any better than this.

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I saw it in the theatre this summer and I just finished watching my dvd copy.  I really didn't/don't understand the negative reviews!  I love the movie!  Like so many, I love the characters and enjoy checking in with them from time to time.  Their progressions are reasonable and thoughtful.  As we viewers do, they get older, their lives take twists and turns, they question their paths from time to time and even sometimes rebel against having to let go of trappings of their younger selves, but they still remain who they are at their cores.<br /><br />What I love most is that they have not become caricatures of their younger selves.  Samantha comes close sometimes, but never quite crosses that line.<br /><br />Don't pay any mind to the slaggy reviews!  SATC2 is a wonderful film, full of the characters we have grown to care for - only we are all a few years older!

B0015DROBO|5.0|I've never written a book review before, but this trilogy made me do it. I was drawn to the main character Lisbeth Salander unlike almost any other character I've ever read. She is an amazing creation; antisocial, brilliant, and completely without social graces, yet I quickly developed complete empathy for her. She is undoubtable one of the strongest figures, male or female, to ever be written. The rich narrative through the series does not run in typical thriller style, as there a long periods of fairly slow plot development at times. However, after picking up the first of the books, I simply could not put them down until I had read the entire trilogy. I am extraordinarily sad that Steig Larson died, if for no other reason because now I will never again get to meet Lisbeth in a new adventure. I can tell I will be re-reading this trilogy for the rest of my life.

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|HEREAFTER is an engrossing but frustrating film.  My interest was held throughout, yet when it was all over, I was extremely disappointed in how little my interest added up to.    Directed by Clint Eastwood, HEREAFTER would appear to be exploring the old question \\"what happens to us after we die,\\" but really it is a character study of a couple of folks who have very atypical experiences with death.  Ultimately, it isn't terribly meaningful because it is NOT universal.    The film starts out with a bang.  We meet Marie (Cecile de France), a TV journalist on vacation in Thailand with her producer boyfriend.  She heads out of the hotel to do some last minute shopping, and in minutes, finds herself facing the tsunami that so famously devastated that region of the world some years ago.  Eastwood is not known for spending big bucks on special effects, but these scenes are fairly effective in their depiction of the awesome destructive force of the killer wave (when we see the wave gathering strength by sucking in all the water from the beach...that is pretty scary).  Marie drowns in the water, and feels herself headed towards a light where shadowy figures beckon to her.  She is brought back to our world, though...but she has been deeply changed by her experience.    We then meet George (Matt Damon), a very shy man living along and working on a loading dock.  He seems unusually withdrawn from the world.  We discover early on that he is a psychic (apparently the real deal) with an ability to see beyond the grave and communicate with the dearly departed to send messages to their loved ones.  His ability is a compelling temptation for all who encounter him (\\"read me!!\\"), but the intimate knowledge he gathers from virtual strangers also alienates him from those folks.  His slimy brother (Jay Mohr) essentially tells him to capitalize on his abilities (\\"with great power comes great responsibility\\") but for George, he is cursed, not gifted.    The third leg of the story is about young British twins Marcus & Jason (played by twins Frankie & George McLaren).  Jason, the stronger and more outgoing brother, is killed, and poor Marcus is sent to a foster home to stew not only about the separation from his drug-addicted mother but about his loss.  The 12-year-old is adrift...compelled to find some way to reach out to his brother again.    All three of these characters carry a sadness with them.  Marcus is obviously saddled with grief, and Damon with loneliness...but it is Marie who is perhaps the most tormented.  She was on top of the world...a celebrity journalist who was also a model.  The world at her feet.  Yet her near-death experience leaves her feeling separate from everyone.  She wants to research her experiences and write about them. Everyone else just urges her to be quiet about it and take some time off from work.  As her career passes her by, she becomes more convinced that her experience was a revelation.    It seems unlikely that these 3 characters would ever meet...but the plot has other contrivances in mind.  I didn't mind...I expected the ultimate meeting of these three to come and for something of import or relevance to happen.  I was left disappointed.    But the film is interesting in large part because the three leads give outstanding performances that are well worth checking out.  McLaren does a nice job of showing the particular kind of grief a child feels.  DeFrance (previously only known to me from her fierce performance in HIGH TENSION) is a striking performer, and makes her character tough but damaged.  And Damon gives another nice performance, underplaying admirably (although occasionally coming across just a little like his character in GOOD WILL HUNTING).  Here is another actor who seems to give nuanced work under the direction of Eastwood.    Another thing that bothered me was the feeling that the entire Tsunami scene existed only to create some really cool previews, so that folks would be more likely to come to themovie.  There is no real reason that Marie needed to have her experience in that famous, true-life tragedy.  She could have drowned in a swimming pool in Milwaukee and had the same shattering, personal experience.  Certainly the scenes are dramatically staged...but they are utterly out of character with the rest of the movie.    HEREAFTER promises much but delivers little, beyond some really nice performances.   For me, that is just enough to recommend it to audiences who understand they are about to see a quiet, slow-paced movie; not some kind of supernatural thriller as the previews hint at.  I just wished that all the hard work had added up to more.

0312600844|5.0|Jonathan Franzen's FREEDOM is by far one of the best novels I have read this year.  It is well deserving of the acclaim accorded to it by Oprah in choosing it as her most recent book club pick.  Franzen's manipulation of plot, his larger than life characters with whom the reader can easily identify, its theme of freedom . . . help to make this an engrossing and sometimes sad, sometimes comedic page turner.    Somewhat of a tragicomedy, FREEDOM tells the story of generations of dysfunctional families.   Its central character is Patty Emerson Berglund, a former college basketball star whose only ambition is to be the best parent she can be.  When Patty was fifteen, she was the victim of rape which went unreported because of her parents' prominence in politics. Vowing to be there for her children always and in every way, she chooses to be a stay-at-home mom instead of a career outside the home.   Her husband, Walter Berglund, a lawyer, chooses instead of a career as a lawyer to pursue his love of birds through his conservation efforts.  Their son Joey, feeling smothered by his mother and experiencing conflicts with his father, chooses to assert his independence at fourteen by moving in with his sixteen-year-old girlfriend Connie and her family next door.  Jessica, their daughter, feels closer to her father than her mother, who, she feels, cares more for Joey than her.  Then there is Richard Katz, Walter's best friend and former roommate in college.  Tall, dark, and handsome and a notorious womanizer, he is the leader of a rock band.  Though very much in love with Walter, Patty is attracted to Richard and does not take advantage of her freedom to have a relationship with him until years after her marriage to Walter.  Consequences, of course, ensue, among them serious bouts of depression.    Freedom comes with privilege and sometimes consequences, as the characters in Franzen's bestseller learn. The consequences in many cases are bouts of depression on the parts of manyof the characters, suggesting a theme in itself.     The author weaves Patty's college basketball career and her husband Walter's love of birds together with the politics of both their families, as the setting moves from one place to another, mainly Saint Paul and Hibbing, Minnesota; New York; and Washington, D. C.  Patty, formerly of New York, is Jewish although she does not practice her faith.  Estranged from her wealthy Emerson family, her son and daughter grow up with little knowledge of Patty's side of the family.  Walter, on the other hand, of very modest means, grew up in Minnesota, where his mother and alcoholic father ran a small motel.      This current Oprah pick gets 5 out of 5 stars in spite of its sometimes \\"coarse\\" details, which were necessary to the plot in that they were symbolic of some of the \\"coarse\\" events:  Patty cheats on a husband who in spite of her shortcomings adores her; Walter, now middle-aged, turns to his twenty-eight-year-old assistant when he learns of Patty's infidelity with his best friend; Joey, their son at fourteen declares his independence from his parents and moves in with his sixteen-year-old girlfriend and her family.    Very well written and captivating from beginning to end, this novel has it all--sex, politics, exploitation under the guise of conservation . . . comedy (the limits and amounts of money Vin Haven and Walter go to to preserve the cerulean warbler) . . . tragedy . . . .Suspenseful to the very touching, heartwarming end!

I thought I was going to like the few songs I heard already, and then the rest of the album would be totally different. But that wasn't the case at all. I actually enjoy EVERY song on this album. It may seem as if I'm a teeny bopper, but they've got really great tracks to dance to.    I would recommend this album to ANYONE, any color. These guys aren't just a one time deal, they are talented and make great music.    My favorites:    Boyfriend  Big Time Rush  Big Night  Nothing Even Matters  Worldwide  City Is Ours  Halfway There
0399536108|5.0|While I tend to be a skeptic about \\"self-help\\" books and books that claim to be able to change your life, The Art of Nonconformity is in many ways the opposite of the expected narrative.  Chris gives great examples about how he has crafted his own life to be independent and fulfilling, but he makes it clear that his choices are not the universal \\"fix-all\\" choices.  The emphasis is on empowerment, personal responsibility, overcoming of fear and the realization that goals and dreams are not only important to have, but are much closer than you realize. The book gives ideas to get you started on a path to reevaluating your life, but never claims to have all the answers.    I found this approach particularly inspiring - at the very least, encouraging unconventional dreams and the paths you chose to get there.

B0021UDJSM|5.0|Since its release, this has been my favorite album by Placebo, which is one of my favorite bands. Discovering that Brian Molko actually broke up with his partner before creating Battle for the Sun makes it even more real and better, in my opinion. If you try playing the album in reverse order, it almost seems to make more sense and convey emotions and events in the order they were experienced. The way the songs are actually ordered on the album seems (at least to me) to say this is how I feel and where I am now and this is why and what happened. Battle for the Sun feels like Brian Molko is taking me through the emotional journey of dealing with, getting through, and getting over and past the difficult break up he experienced. Battle for the Sun is one of the deepest, most real albums I've ever heard. Those who, like myself, have been through similar experiences can identify and connect with the songs and emotional states expressed in Battle for the Sun, but even if you have not, its an audio and emotional masterpiece and the two elements combine to make the perfect vessel for an journey of feeling and music that everyone should experience.

0316069485|2.0|The reversal could have been better; however, the lengthy trial made getting through this difficult before any real action began. The action only started at the end of the trial, when the defense attorney is murdered by his own client. Also the ending is incomplete; therefore, this will be a series. Also the use of the \\"n\\" word was not necessary as when Black males are using the \\"n\\" word it is with an \\"a\\" at the end and not the er at the end. If Michael Connelly continues to use the \\"n\\" word, he needs to use the context correctly since black males don't go around saying the \\"N\\" word with the er on the end.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Like may others, I was a bit skeptical when it was announced that Matt Smith would be taking over for the brilliant Mr. Tennant. However, I was (and forgive me, fellow Who fans, for saying this) also skeptical when I heard about Tennant taking over for Christopher Eccleston. I decided to give both men the benefit of the doubt and I was glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised at Smith and the way he instantly took charge of the role and made it his own. From his first craving for apples to his repeated assertion that bow ties are cool to saving the universe with Amy, Rory and River, Matt Smith has firmly cemented himself as the Doctor and I can't wait to get this box set and relive every pulse-pounding, jaw dropping, bow tie clad moment.
0307454541|3.0|Ok..I don't read much fiction, but was intrigued by the high ratings and publicity for this book. Spoke to a lady at a bar who raved about the book. Well, I give it 3 stars. it is not all that well written, the story is forced, the technical aspects of hacking (my primary interest) were limited, and the foreign environment (cities, slang, etc) made it a overall mediocre read.  if you like good fiction: Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel is 5 Stars

The production,the riffs,the songs/hooks,lyrics and Mark's unbelievable vocals make this one of the greatest metal albums of all time. I recently went back and listened to ALL the old Accept albums and song for song this album is as good if not BETTER than all of the classics.I'll go as far to say that thank god Udo didn't come back because he couldn't have done as good a job as Mark.(I'm not saying it wouldn't of been good)But we would'nt of had THIS masterpiece.<br /><br />Yep,I was the idiot that said \\"they should call the band \\"Except\\" because it would be Accept EXCEPT Udo isn't here\\" Oh well we all make mistakes...lol<br /><br />I guess I've never been more wrong in my life and happily so.<br />It IS Accept and thank god Udo didn't come back and ruin it.<br /><br />Wolf,Peter,Mark and Andy made a classic. \m/<br />Can't wait for another one.

B001HBX91S|4.0|Bought this Blu-Ray for testing my home theater. It offers an unusual range of audio codecs. As far as entertaining - meh, it falls short of amazing.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Having collected pretty much all the Beatles' CD releases since 1987, I would like to present my considered (but by no means definitive) views on the re-release of the 'Blue' Album Compilation (1967 -1970) which has been newly minted in remastered form by Apple Records.     For all fellow Beatles fans considering whether to invest (again!) in this title - I have played and compared it, track by track, against the original 1993 CD and also against previous digital releases that hold some of the same tracks, namely The Beatles '1' CD Album (from 2000) and the `Let it Be - Naked' CD Album (from 2003). My aim is to provide a useful, constructively-critical guide to anyone unsure about committing themselves to this purchase.     Disc 1     1. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" - 4:10  I found the new version on the '2010 'Blue' Album to have far more detailed and defined mellotron in the opening bars of the song than the old 1993 CD, there's also better resolution to John's vocals to the point where the `splice' that makes up the two halves of the track can now be clearly identified; the increase in added information continues with the gently whispered '1, 2, 3, 4..1, 2' count by George Martin mid-song now clearly audible in the mix.    2. \\"Penny Lane\\" - 3:03   I think that the 2010 'Blue' version has much better bass definition than the 1993 'Blue' version and the piccolo trumpet and flute scores are now crisper and more believable, Ringo's symbols now have truer metallic edge and Paul's plaintive vocal is fuller in the mix.(It has to be noted that the version on the '1' album was particularly bright and brittle sounding in the brass section).    3. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" - 2:02   It seems obvious to me that the Yellow Submarine - 'Songtrack' versions of the next three songs sound superior to anything available on the 1993 & 2010 'Blue' albums, in this case Paul's vocal is delivered with greater scale and dynamics, Ringo's snare has a real 'crack' to the impact on the drum skin and the French Horn parts are full of vigour.    4. \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" - 2:44  The superlatives continue with the Yellow Submarine - 'Songtrack' version of this track too, starting with the lead vocal from Ringo which has the kind of resolution that makes you believe he's in the room with you, allied to the stunningly detailed answering harmonies from John and Paul and the crisp and realistic tone to the tambourine that now doesn't sound like someone shaking aluminium bottle-tops. Nothing on the1993 or 2010 'Blue' album versions come anywhere near it.    5. \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" - 3:28  Again I think that the Yellow Submarine - 'Songtrack' delivers the best rendition of John's  psychedelic song than either of the 1993 or 2010 'Blue' album's can muster, the stereo image is wider and more expansive the effects-laden lead vocal is more powerful and direct, Ringo's drums have better presence and Paul's bass sound is both richer and fuller.    6. \\"A Day in the Life\\" - 5:06  I actually much prefer the new 2010 'Blue' album's version of this track to the previous 1993 incarnation, it's clear from the outset  that the reverb-drenched lead vocal from John now has a larger scale and that his punctuated end delivery of '....made the grade...t-t-t-t-t' leaves far more echo to decay far deeper into the soundstage; the climactic Orchestration now has real bite and menace and the ring of the alarm clock that signals Paul's bouncy middle eight is crisper and more defined than on the previous version.    7. \\"All You Need Is Love\\" - 3:48  Back to the Yellow Submarine - 'Songtrack' CD for the best rendition of John's `One World' signature tune in my view, the sweeping string section of the Orchestration has a more clear sonic bite and the lead vocal is more solidly delivered than either version found on the 1993 or 2010 'Blue' albums; Ringo's opening drum-roll is far more precise and the wandering cellos reveal each bow movement from there score in greater detail.    8. \\"I Am the Walrus\\" - 4:37  The 2010 'Blue' Album gives a slightly wider and taller stereo image than it's 1993 counterpart, as a consequence the mellotron part is now more audible, Ringo's drums are better defined and John's heavily distorted vocal is more focused; the trumpet score is now particularly large and imposing allied to the stronger potency to the swirling effects tape that punctuates and ends the song.    9. \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" - 3:31  I think the Beatles `1' Album contains the better sounding version of this bouncy single from Paul than either of the 1993 or 2010 'Blue' albums, although the detail level in comparison to both is 'brightly lit' which may not suit all tastes, it does mean the Orchestration of the strings is relayed with a touch more realism and the strike of Ringo's drumsticks against his symbols is audibly `metallic' - Paul's bass figuring is also fuller and more rounded.    10. \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" - 3:00   It's clear from the outset that the 2010 'Blue' Album version beats the old 1993 'Blue' Album CD as Paul's dreamy vocal delivery now has stronger depth and fuller studio reverb, the background timpani, triangle and maracas are all better realised and defined.    11. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" - 2:51   The smoother trumpet intro to the 2010 'Blue' Album version and its more accurate portrayal of Paul and John's driving vocals throughout the song allied to stronger bass and striking cowbell percussion means it is clearly better than the previous 1993 CD release.    12. \\"Lady Madonna\\" - 2:17   I much prefer the new 2010 'Blue' Album remaster of Paul's boogie-woogie style thumper to both the old 1993 version and the version on The Beatles '1' Album, the tack piano is better defined, the sax solo is stronger and Ringo's drum kit has a meatier drive to the beat.      13. \\"Hey Jude\\" - 7:08   Again I feel that the new 2010 'Blue' Album has the better sounding version of Paul's classic single, his opening vocal sounds creamier as is his punctuation at the microphone and the bass and drum tracks really hit home hard as the song builds to its climax. (It has to be noted that the Beatles '1' Album version was plagued with sibilance to the vocal and brittleness to the sound of the symbols in comparison)    14. \\"Revolution\\" - 3:21   In my opinion the 2010 'Blue' Album version of this rocker beats the 1993 incarnation in every department, it's a no-brain clear winner with superior drums, guitar, bass and vocals - wow.        Disc 2   1. \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" - 2:45   In my opinion the 2010 'Blue' Album version only just pips the 1993 'Blue' Album version - as this track probably comes the closest to saying that there's no dramatic sonic improvement, the vocals are a little clearer and the tack piano is a smidgen better focused with a touch better sound to Ringo's drum kit - but it's all very slight.    2. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" - 4:45   I think the new 2010 'Blue' Album presents a perceptible upgrade to the previous 1993 release, George's vocal is sweeter with a touch more studio echo, Paul's bass is smoother and Ringo's kit now holds the beat with real 'snap' to the snare and metallic 'tap' to the high-hat.    3. \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" - 3:05  Again, it's my belief that the new 2010 'Blue' Album holds the improved version of this quasi-Reggae track from Paul, the core bass, piano and drums are all better presented and the handclaps that open the track now sound like human hands rather than damp rags.    4. \\"Get Back\\" - 3:14   I think the best adaptation of this driving single from Paul comes packaged within the `Let it Be -Naked' CD from 2003, the stereo image is far more accurate and the soundstage wider and deeper; Paul's bass is stunningly deep and the piano parts (both standard and electric) are far more defined within their own space in the sonic image - amazing.    5. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" - 3:33   It's clear to me that the `Let it Be -Naked' CD has the superior version of this heartfelt song from John, Ringo's bass drum has a real 'kick' to it and the backing track of bass and piano are cleaner and more accurate than the new remaster.       6. \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" - 2:59   It was a close call, but the version from The Beatles '1' CD seemed to me to have better vocals and piano than the remastered version on the 2010 release; it also suffers less tape-hiss and the simple drumming provided by Paul is relayed with better clarity.    7. \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" - 3:18   I believe The 2010 'Blue' Album has the best sounding version of this song from George, the remastering now brings clarity to the bass, tack piano and most especially to George's lead vocal which turns from the 'muffled' sound on the 1993 release to a delivery that more accurately describes that it was captured in the space of a vocal booth.    8. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" - 3:05   It's clear that George's beautiful song of freedom and renewal gets a fresh outing on The 2010 'Blue' Album remaster, it trumps the previous 1993 CD version in most departments with significantly improved lead guitar, drums and bass; the background sound of the moog synthesiser is `fatter' and the Orchestration in the closing bars is portrayed with a wider and more crystalline stereo image.    9. \\"Come Together\\" - 4:20   As this Chuck Berry influenced rocker from John is based mainly on the trio of guitar, bass and drums it's significant to hear the improvements of all these instruments on the 2010 'Blue' Album remaster, John's heavily reverb-drenched vocal and Ringo's thumping drum fills are a clear step up from the older 1993 CD as well as the newer 2000 '1' release.    10. \\"Something\\" - 3:03   George's gorgeous love song gets a definite clean and brush up on the 2010 'Blue' Album version - his vocals, Paul's bass and the backing organ and Orchestration are all a major upgrade when compare to the dry 1993 CD and over-processed and sibilant '1' CD version.    11. \\"Octopus's Garden\\" - 2:51   It'sclear to me that the 2010 'Blue' Album version of this upbeat song from Ringo beats the previous 1993 CD in every way, the drum track drives harder the high-hat and symbols now relay the detailed `tap' of drumstick on metal  and the lead vocal, harmonies and bass figures all register far more distinctly in the stereo mix.    12. \\"Let It Be\\" - 3:52   As previously outlined, unless you're a huge fan of the 'Spector' mix of this single I'd point you in the direction of the 'unadulterated' version that exists on the 'Let it Be - Naked' CD from 2003 as the piano, vocals, drums, bass and harmonies are all superior in every respect. (for those of you who are partial to the `harps & harmonies' version then, although it falls short in key areas for me, the new 2010 remaster isn't too shabby).    13. \\"Across the Universe\\" - 3:48   Again, unless you're only interested in the 'Spector & Klein' origins of this track I'd wholeheartedly recommend the version on the 'Let it Be - Naked' Album, as you're closer than ever before to John's plaintive vocal held against a sparse but dynamic background of acoustic guitar and swirling swarmandel. (if you must hold to the overdubbed version, then the new 2010 remaster is a fair alternative - with only slightly improved sound over the 1993 'Blue' CD).    14. \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" - 3:38  A final call for all 'Phil & Alan' fans who can have a decent upgrade in sound by visiting the new 2010 remaster - but, in my honest opinion, the real gold lies buried within the `Let it Be -Naked' Album as this `undubbed' version clearly excels in all areas, you can easily distinguish between the makes of instruments within the generously expansive mix as Paul delivers crystal clear vocals over his Blunther piano parts and John delivers his best bass attempts on the 6 string Fender Bass whilst George's Telecaster solo has never sounded so rich and true.        So in closing, I can recommend this new 2010 Apple records release to all those new to theBeatles' musical catalogue as it's the best place to continue your journey of discovery of their recorded work (after the `Red' 1962 - 1966 Album) - for all those others, like me, who are already 'addicted', you can buy this CD knowing most of the tracks will give an upgrade in sound quality to the 1993 release....    However, if you don't have them already, I also recommend that you buy the `Let it Be - Naked' & The Beatles '1' CD albums to fully realise the best sounding versions of these 28 tracks.
0767827694|3.0|Originally distributed in 1992, Sally Potter's film Orlando was re-released last summer. Ms. Potter adapted the screenplay from Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel Orlando: A Biography about an individual who changes genders halfway through her over four-hundred year long life. The movie is divided into seven sections: Death, Love, Poetry, Politics, Society, Sex, and Birth.    Excruciatingly slow and cryptic, Orlando is nonetheless a gorgeous work of art. Its enthralling music, mostly composed by Ms. Potter and David Motion, contributes to the film's dreamlike ambiance. Orlando's color palette is also extraordinary. Cinematographer Aleksei Rodionov shoots the Rococo period's pastel blues and pinks in muted light. Candles illuminate the Renaissance's bold outfits and elaborate rituals.    Tilda Swinton looks the part of the androgynous Orlando, but the movie's acting and writing are stilted and bizarre. Amongst the film's many unsubtle messages, its most powerful theme is that of identity. Though difficult to get through, Orlando has an entrancing originality.

B003IPC5SO|3.0|WELL I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD...I DON'T AGREE that all the songs sound alike...actually 3 or 4 of them are really cool.Unfortunately the song she sang on DWTS recently was \\"Get Outta My Way\\"..one of the decidedly weaker tracks here.I have to wonder if her handlers insist on her being \\"current\\" or \\"hip\\" or whatever the terms is...but at least half of these songs could have been done by a young,just-starting-out teeny-bopper (think Miley or Britney at her synthy-vocoder auto-tune worst).We all know Kylie can sing...i have heard her live,but somewhere along the line she has decided to (i think) go backwards in time while trying to be too much of this era.When i think of \\"Better the Devil\\",\\"Finer Feelings\\" or most of the songs on \\"Fever\\" (which i memorized in 3 days) i am a little perplexed at the direction she is moving.Hopefully she can return to a more mature and much less \\"tweaked\\" sound on her next work.\\"Closer\\" and \\"Better than Today\\" are 2 stand-outs here; they are very unique songs and i wish there were more like them...not the chirpy \\"Cupid Boy\\" or \\"Illusion'...worth buying if a big fan, but not as a first Kylie CD...

B002ZG98VE|3.0|Really....Medieval music is/was not the Irish/Celtic dance/folk stuff you hear these days.   But that's what was on the soundtrack.   They should have hired whoever it was that provided the music for The Tudors.    If you want to hear authentic music for the times, check out medieval.org for suggestions, or Music of the Crusades, the Newberry Consort, etc....    The music is actually my biggest beef.  Other than that, it's all Technicalities....    Crowe's voice sounds kind of....high?  Hoarse?   The soldiers on horses running up the hill looked extremely fake; they did in other scenes as well.  And I really don't like Cate Blanchett in the Marion part.  She's too old to play a fertile 30 yo type....sorry!  (I should know, I'm one of those, too...)    I think the direction and casting are excellent.   Loved Oscar Isaac as King John.  William Hurt is excellent in his part (Marshall) and it's good to see him back - especially in such a big movie.    And absolutely LOVED Scott Grimes as Will Scarlett - but all I can think of is \\"Archie\\" the archer...!!  (ER fans will know...)  Way to Go Scott!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Love the fact that the movie includes the DVD, Blu-ray, and a digital copy. This is how it should be for all movies. The movie itself is fantastic and there are plenty of extras. Great all-around package.
B003Z0D4SM|5.0|After finishing this book I read the one and two star ratings.  I suppose that I shouldn't be surprised that some people like to \\"hear themselves think\\" but it seems to me that if they hated the book as much as they seem to, they could and should have thrown the damn thing away!  Yet strangely they took valuable time to be caustic.  One wonders...<br /><br />Yes, there are some passages that are redundant (like coffee making) and some translation problems, but over all this BOOK IS BRILLIANT, EXCITING, AND VERY VERY READABLE!<br /><br />I finish by saying that I originally decided to read the book with reservations, I usually do not read novels with this type of hype and promotion.  But I did it, and very glad that I did.  I will certainly read the next two, and probably be sorry there will be no more.

I mean come on Amazon a big company such as yourself can't afford at least UPS?  But overall I got the DVD in great, brand new condition.  The disc wasn't scratched, the booklet was in the case, everything was in order.  Now the DVD itself was more than I could ever ask.  This is a DVD every metal fan should have.  I wouldn't recommend Amazon site to everyone, but hey if your cheap on money it's better than buying from FYI.
0439023513|2.0|I really didn't enjoy this book.  After the exciting and fascinating ride the first two books took me on, I was expecting more.  This book seemed like it was written in a hurry.  It didn't really add anything to the story.  It's basically just a bunch of gory battle scenes interspersed with Katniss finding new places to hide, strung together to form a very weak plot that will probably only appeal to fans of war novels.  After finishing the book, I didn't feel happy for the characters or thoughtful about their predicaments or inspired to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our world.  I just felt depressed.<br /><br />I wish now that I had just read The Hunger Games and stopped there.  This final book tainted my impression of the whole series.

031603438X|5.0|If there's a person out there whose life needed to be chronicled, it's Keith Richards. And you know what's really amazing? He actually remembers it, despite all those drugs.  So as you could probably guess, his \\"Life\\" is an amazing read -- Richards glides through his own eventful past with grace, charm and a slightly sarcastic sense of humor.<br /><br />Richards was the \\"choirboy to school rebel\\" raised in Dartford, where he began to blossom at the birth of rock'n'roll. And after some false starts in other areas, his love of music began to gel into something when he met Mick Jagger (they bonded over their shared love of American blues music), and ended up forming a band called the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />You know how it goes: they became the creative heart of the Rolling Stones, who started off as a penniless little blues band and turned into the wildest rock stars of the sixties and seventies. Richards' life became wrapped up in stardom, his sensual avant-garde lover Anita Pallenberg, and a heroin addiction -- until he inevitably yanked himself back up, found new love, and survived despite the odds.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for Keith Richards -- he's had a crazy, colorful, dramatic life full of scandal and raw talent, but by all acounts, he's a nice guy. And \\"Life\\" doesn't disprove that -- Richards is less interested in telling all than in exploring the interesting parts of his life.<br /><br />His style is laid-back and contemplative, as if you were just sitting in his living room listening to the old rocker reminiscing about his life. He talks a LOT about music (creating it, listening to it, playing it), encountering fascinating people, and carefully painting portraits of the many places he's travelled to.<br /><br />Richards himself seems like  an unpretentious, blunt guy with a positive outlook, who freely admits his mistakes because they're in the past. He also has nice things to say about almost everybody, although some things (Brian Jones beating Anita) make him pretty mad. But he doesn't shy away from bleaker times, such as when he recounts how his son Marlon had to help him during his druggiest days.<br /><br />And he has a sarcastically witty streak -- he says that he was \\"kind of proud\\" to be the #1 on death lists for ten years running. \\"I was really disappointed when I went down the charts. Finally dropping down to number nine. Oh my God, it's over.\\"<br /><br />If you weren't a fan of \\"Keef\\" before this, his unpretentious and fascinating \\"Life\\" might just win you over.

B003WTE886|5.0|I got this album because I was a casual fan of her previous two albums.  I love this album.  I can't believe how great a writer she is at such a young age.  My favorite songs from this album are \\"Mine\\" \\"Back to December\\" \\"Dear John\\" and \\"Enchanted\\".  I was really only expecting to like maybe one more song besides the single since that's how many albums are but the whole album is really good.  Thanks Taylor for making another great album and for having the guts to write about everything on your mind
B003WTE886|4.0|Once, Taylor Swift was just a girl with a guitar who wrote songs about boys and her life. Taylor Swift is still  a girl with a guitar who writes songs about boys and her life. Except these boys aren't on the football team, these boys John Mayer and Kayne West and Taylor Launter.     Hello, fame.     Because so much of her life is splashed across gossip blogs and magazines, the songs wind up feeling vaguely familiar. It's cool to hear her side of the story - I commend her for it; calling out the ex or owning up to busting up a relationship is pretty ballsy! -  but it takes away from the music and makes it a little less relatable.  (John Mayer isn't about to take me out for dinner anytime soon.)     We didn't know Drew (of Teardrops fame) which allowed us to fill in our versions. You could argue that you could do the same for \\"Dear John\\", but it's kind of hard to do when the guy's a major celebrity himself. The same goes for the VMA incident - I'll never be able to listen to \\"Innocent\\" without going, \\"Imma let you finish\\". It's kind of like watching the movie before reading the book. The characters have already been filled in - you know how it's supposed to be. And if you didn't, you would've read about it on-line.      The boys aside, the music is good. Her voice is stronger (maybe prettier?), the music more developed. She trying new things, but her lyrics still evoke emotion and the melodies are catchy. \\"Last Kiss\\" and \\"Enchanted\\" are really pretty, solid tunes and in ways remind me of songs that could've been on her first album.     Other songs seem like a continuation of \\"Fearless\\". \\"Long Live\\" is almost a follow up to \\"Change\\" and \\"Never Grow Up\\" is as if she's reminiscing about that \\"Best Day\\". And \\"Speak Now\\" and \\"Mean\\" have the same spunk songs like \\"You Belong with Me\\" or \\"Pictures to Burn\\" have.     This is her most mature, most well-rounded effort and I truly like it. Do I love it like I do the others? Not yet, but I will.

0307454541|5.0|This book is a cross between mystery/suspense/drama.  Lisbeth is an unusual sort of private investigator who is originally enlisted by her boss to look up information on Mikael Blomkvist, then just as quickly told that there's no need to continue the investigation.  She, however, has her interest piqued and continues the investigation on her own.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is the part-owner, publisher, and journalist of a respected financial magazine who is apparently fed a false story by an old friend.  When he publishes the story, he is sued for libel by the subject of the story .. and loses, which means he will be spending some time in jail.  To preserve the reputation of the magazine, he steps down from his post.  He receives a mysterious offer (through the same attorney who originally hired Lisbeth's firm to run a background check on HIM [although he doesn't find THIS out until much later]) from a millionaire industrialist (Henrik Vanger) to look into the matter of his granddaughter Harriet's disappearance for a year.  The best thing - the industrialist's offer to give him the real dirt on the financial \\"guru\\" who sued him for libel when the year is up.<br /><br />For over 30 years, Henrik has been receiving a yearly 'gift' - a pressed, framed flower - an apparent mockery of the flowers that he used to receive as gifts from his granddaughter prior to her disappearance.  The police haven't been able to make any progress into the case, although Morrell, the original detective in charge, has never been able to stop investigating.<br /><br />That's the bare bones plot.  But the novel is so much more.<br /><br />We start out with a scene of a young girl who is being held captive by someone.<br /><br />We read in turn about Lisbeth and Mikael.

1441866868|5.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, there is a complex world which is both character driven and has a richly faceted setting.  It's interesting and complex on many levels.  On the other hand, I listened to the audiobook, and at least every 45 minutes a female character voiced by generic asian accent would say, \\"Sorry, so sorry.\\"  That made me wonder whether the target audience of the audiobook version has somewhat odd views about women and particularly Asian women.    That aside, The Windup Girl has rich setting and characters and pulled me in.  It is set in a future in which genetic engineering has caused problems and is now mankind's only route to survival.  various genetically engineered diseases for plants have disrupted food production.  Tradtional farming does not exist, and instead calorie companies sell modified seeds which can survive in the new world.  These companies race to produce new strains as diseases mutate and try to find genetic samples from crop plants of the past which are now extinct.    The story is set in Bankok, where Anderson Lake, an American employed by the calorie companies, is sent to look for \\"new\\" plants - plants thought to be extinct, but which have somehow survived in a world of genetically engineered crop diseases.    Bankok politics is a mix of idealistic and pragmatic factions.  Bankok has a sealed-off underground seed archive of sorts, where seeds of crops which cannot withstand new diseases are kept and periodically cutivated so that fresh seeds can be collected to preserve the species.  Pragmatic factions of government wish to begin global trade, perhaps by trading genetic information from the seed archive.  Idealistic factions of government wish to protect genetic integrity of people and anything else, because genetic engineering caused so much harm in the past.    Emiko, the title character, is a wind-up girl - a Japanese genetically engineered servant.  This is a story in which Asian females repeatedlysay \\"Sorry, so sorry\\" and so caters to certain readership interests.  It should come as no surprise that Emiko was genetically engineered and then trained in a school (kind of like a factory) to be sex-companion.  She is also a translator and business assistant, for purposes of all-around companionship.  She ages very slowly, has smooth skin with the tradeoff that she can't sweat, has a nagging compulsion to latch on to a rich man, and has jerky movements when she moves quickly so that her genetic engineering can be spotted from afar.  She's been abandoned by her Japanese owner and is now the novelty item in a whorehouse.  Because she's been genetically engineered, half the Bankok political sanctions would kill her if they knew of her existence.  Because she has a compulsion to latch on to a rich man, she latches on to Anderson Lake among others.    It would be impossible to summarize the plot to The Windup Girl.  It's intricate with tons of subplots.  Suffice it to say it has both strong characters and a strong environment.    Overall, I recommend this book if the plot, characters or setting seem at all interesting.  It's very well executed and held my interest and curiosity.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|James Cameron has crafted a movie that is spectacular and disappointing at the same time. His world-building regarding the moon Pandora and its ecosystem is almost seamless, and fully realized on screen. You have no trouble believing he spent a decade developing the biosphere, well-inspired by his deep sea documentaries and other explorations into the natural world. Some of the characters are quite interesting as well, most notably the alien Neytiri (Sam Worthington's obligatory love interest) and the picture's eventual villain, Colonel Quaritch. The science fiction technology is also remarkable and realistic, and the final 40-minute battle scene is beyond doubt among the greatest scenes of combat ever portrayed on film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of the movie falters as Cameron loses himself in this extraterrestrial take on the Noble Savage fallacy. Such a shame that this happened, too, since the tensions between the colonizing humans and the native Na'vi was ripe for moral complexity. The plotting also seemed lazy. If the humans and Na'vi are going to war, why not have it be for a better, more compelling reason than \\"Well, their village just happens to be right on top of our needed resource, and so they need to move\\"? The dialogue was equally lethargic, with very few memorable catchphrases, and hardly any words to quicken the mind or get the blood pumping.<br /><br />In all, Cameron's visual accomplishments with this epic cannot be denied, but it would have been a movie for the ages, akin to Lord of the Rings or Casablanca if only he had given more layers to its story and the people inhabiting it. Avatar is a missed opportunity, but a very shiny one that will still stick in your imagination.
0385342047|1.0|I admit that I have read all of the Shopoholic series with full knowledge of the way 'things usually turn out'. Becky Bloomwood's appeal to me has always been that, beneath the crazy designer togs drama, she's a big-hearted, lovable protagonist. But this book makes it difficult to like Becky. It's cute when you're in your early 20s and you have a problem with credit card debt and there's a charming incident with a scarf. It's altogether maddening, however, when your late 20s heroine who is now a mother, blatantly lies to her husband, her parents, and her friends. There's no charm in that. I couldn't even finish this one.
0679746323|5.0|Finally, a massively researched book that paints an accurate portrait of one of the evilest men of the 20th century.  Why so many others try to see the good in Mao baffles me.  It is like trying to rehabilitate the legacy of Hitler or Stalin.  Evil thugs are evil thugs.<br /><br />Yes there are some factual errors in the book, but that is inescapable when someone writes such a massive work.  It always bugs me when dilettantes who vastly overestimate how just how smart they are, point to a list of 5 or 10 factual errors and say 'so the rest of the 800 pages are wrong too.' The fact is most of this book is extremely well documented and accurate.  And the authors interpretations of Mao's motivations are based on extensive knowledge of the man.  Their picture of Mao is fundamentally accurate and consistent.<br /><br />This book painful.  Reading about real world nonfiction sadistic torture, mass starvation, the destruction of all works of art, the incitement of children to beat to death other children, and other crimes against humanity is not pleasant.  But if you are interested in Mao, and communist China, this is THE book to get.<br /><br />So why is there such a strong reaction against this monumental work?<br /><br />1) Denial.  One of the problems most have is not understanding that there exist people in this world with no consciences: that is, people who see other people as nothing more than chess pieces, cattle, and/or playthings.  The actions and motivations of conscience-less people are hard to fathom for normal humans; and so when we see or hear about those without consciences,  our automatic response is to dismiss the information or to try to rationalize the inhuman behaviour.<br /><br />Seeing Mao as a normal person and trying to understand his actions and motivations as such means you will not understand Mao.  It is like trying to understand Hitler, Stalin, or any other sociopath\psychopath\extreme narcissist without recognizing the fact that their personalities are deviant.<br /><br />2) I also see the very human trait of believing what we were told as children as coming into play.  That is why Muslim children for the most part grow up to be adult Muslims, and Christian children Christian adults.  So people who have grown up in Maoist countries, being indoctrinated about Mao, are going to face a struggle coming to terms with just exactly who and what he was.<br /><br />3) Our need for happy endings.  Stories that have no resolution or where evil wins are hard for modern people to take.  We look for silver linings where there are none, and in so doing distort history.e very human trait of believing what we were told as children as coming into play.

B003XQRZ7E|2.0|I bought this CD while on a business trip.  I listened to it while on a long drive back to my hotel.  Having heard what each of these musicians is capable of, I was primed and ready to like this CD.  However, after one listen, I'm ready to sell it back.  I've heard many great vocal performances from Glenn Hughes - this is not one of them.  Most of his vocals here are not singing, they are shouting.  He's so much better than this [think of his work with Tony Iommi or Gary Moore].  The first thought that came to mind was that he was trying to be the male version of Christina Aguilera.  According to drummer Jason Bonham, it took ten days to record and mix this album.  It sounds like it.  I've heard Kevin Shirley's work with guitarist Joe Bonamassa, Iron Maiden and Rush.  He has good-sounding productions.  His production acumen deserts him here.  As for keyboardist Derek Sherinian, why did he join this band?  You can barely hear him in the mix.  His talents are woefully under-utilized here.  Jason Bonham does good work here.  His drumming is one of the few bright spots of Black Country Communion.  Joe Bonamassa is an excellent blues-rock player, but he's horribly miscast as a hard-rock player here.  Don't quit your day job Joe.  I expected much from this CD - it didn't deliver.

So when our high school daughter wanted to go to home school, we agreed. For the most part things went smoothly except for mathematics, which none of us understand. But when we got to Romeo and Juliet and I showed the usual Olivia Hussey version, our daughter could not comprehend it. In total bafflement, she kept asking, &#34;But they're nice, rich, upper-class people. Why didn't they just let their kids marry each other?&#34;<br /><br />One day our drama major grown daughter showed up at our house and announced that she was taking our youngest daughter to a movie. They got home three hours later and our dramatic daughter said, &#34;Now come on, YOU'RE going to see this movie.&#34;<br /><br />She took us to the gangsta version of Romeo and Juliet, and we were both extremely impressed. When we got home, we discussed the play with our teenager, and now she understood it perfectly. There are numerous gangs in our neighborhood, and not too long before two friends of hers had killed each other a block from our church while our meetings were in progress.<br /><br />Get this, anybody who disapproves: There were gangs in Shakespeare's day. There were gangs in King Solomon's day; the Book of Proverbs specifically mentions gang signs made with the hands. There is nothing new about gangs. And the Montagues and Capulets were gangsters, even if they were rich, upper-class gangsters.<br /><br />Our daughter, to our amusement, kept dragging her friends to see the movie, until we managed to get a copy of it at home, and then she brought her friends to watch it at home.<br /><br />I do not claim that she became an instant drama addict. She did not. She'd rather watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She never did understand why we often bought several different film editions of some plays. She could see that they were different, but she didn't and apparently couldn't get the concept of dramaturgy. She never could understand why we didn't know that Ophelia was pregnant until Mel Gibson told us. I went back and reread the play, and by golly, he was right. She was pregnant, and it's perfectly clear in the text. But she couldn't see that, either.<br /><br />But my point is that if Shakespeare were alive today, and knew what was going on in the  United States, he'd guffaw at the Olivia Hussey version, and he'd be delighted with the gangsta version, because it says what he wanted to say.<br /><br />This is well dramaturged (if that's a word), well cast, well directed, well acted, and has wonderful special effects, such as the name of the automatic pistols the gangsters were using. (No, I'm not going to tell you. Go see for yourself.)<br /><br />I recommend this play to anybody who wants to teach it to his or her own child. I would fast-forward through the transvestite stripper scene, which was totally extraneous to the plot and slowed the movie down, but with that one exception, I would show it. Of course I'd have to give parents the right to opt their children out, if I wanted to show it at high school, but remember that today Romeo and Juliet both would be in high school.<br /><br />I'd give this nine points if the scale went up to ten. I'd cut one point for that stripper scene. But I don't feel it's worth cutting one whole star for one unnecessary and obnoxious scene.never could understand why we didn't know that Ophelia was pregnant until Mel Gibson told us.

038572179X|3.0|Perhaps more a book to be discussed than enjoyed.<br /><br />Spoilers.<br /><br />Atonement is broken up into four very distinct parts. I found the first part the least engaging, which (unfortunately for me) was over half of the entire book. This could perhaps be put down to masculine preference: part one focuses on the minutia of a precocious `tween' girl's thoughts, whereas parts two and three centre on incidents in WW2 - the evacuation from Dunkirk, and the experience of nurses receiving the wounded back in England. The very short final part plays with the story/author within the story.<br /><br />There's no doubting that McEwan can write. He appears to have a real concern for period detail. I say `appears' because I'm not an expert on 1930s/early WW2 Britain. That being said, it's a time that interests me, and I've spent a fair bit of time in primary source material by authors like George Orwell, [[ASIN:0091744040 John Wain]], and C.S. Lewis - or even the slightly earlier P.G. Wodehouse). One of the pleasures of this book is the evocation of the manners, attitudes and settings of an English country house, the Tommies awaiting rescue, and the cold Victorian officious stoicism of a hospital (all strikingly juxtaposed with the 21st Century post-script/Part 4). He vividly takes you into these places, adding highly effective details (such as the petty nonsense of having to line up each of the wheels on each hospital bed). His characters are clearly individual and largely avoid stereotype. The plot issues are powerful.<br /><br />Still I'm playing the `personal web review' card and less concerned with whether this book was well written than if it works for someone like me. When McEwan's lavishing this time and detail onto the wartime settings I was really drawn in. However when he's doing the same, as he is for most of the book, for the country house through the eyes of a consciously myopic young girl, I found it laboured and eventually tiresome. Perhaps he felt he needed to go into such extensive psychological detail to justify Briony's awful crime. Not, that is, to make it any less awful, but to make her action plausible without painting her as an absolute villain. Even if he achieved this, it was at the crucial expense of pace. Not that you need to have three gruesome deaths on every page to write a gripping story, but that donating more space to, say, a tantrum exploring each thought a girl has as she hacks at nettles with a stick, than you do to, say, those of a central character getting out of jail after being unjustly sentenced, is - to this reader - troublesome. Again, I can see reasons why he spelt some things out as carefully as he did, but I can't say this was entertaining. Perhaps it gave some more nuance to Briony and her relationships, more intellectual grounding to her actions. Maybe it was to show critics he could write from a textured female perspective (I just noticed that I described his novel `Amsterdam' as `masculine'). Whatever - I found the sheer volume of words to set up Briony's crime actually denuded its impact.<br /><br />Hence it's so refreshing when we suddenly leap under fire into France. This episode is powerfully and richly conveyed (with McEwan later cheekily hinting at the sort research he may have undertaken by inserting his faux author into the last passage) - I'm disappointed that I missed that part of the movie (it was odd coming at a book that I dimly `remembered' parts of before I read it, having flicked over to it now and then while watching something else on another channel), which seemed very faithful in the parts I caught (the incident at the fountain, Briony giving her name to the dying French soldier). Similarly the evocation of a nurse's training and context in London at this time was visceral and absorbing. As an aside, I happened to be looking into some of the events surrounding Dunkirk as part of an essay a class of mine was doing on Winston Churchill, and `Atonement' really hammers the massive resentment the army felt towards the RAF (with them suggesting the `A' stood for `Absent'). My tiny bit of googling made me aware that there are two sides to this debate (some arguing that the RAF were engaged, indeed, stretched, to protect the evacuees but not within sight of the beaches, others that Churchill consciously exposed the troops because he didn't think he could afford to risk losing too many planes in anticipation of a German invasion). I'm sure McEwan has a much more informed opinion of this, but Atonement is entirely justified in conveying the anger of the infantry, whether or not it was entirely justified.<br /><br />I can't let this review pass without rolling my eyes and shaking my head at yet another ridiculously juvenile sex scene (cf.Price's [[ASIN:1933397128 The Labyrinth Makers]]) in an otherwise adult novel. Why would an author be so concerned for plausibility in some areas so blithely produce the Mills and Boon/\\"I never thought this would happen to me..\\" dross of Robbie and Cecilia's ludicrous library encounter? \\"His experience was limited and he only knew at second hand that they need not lie down. As for her, beyond all the films she had seen, and the novels and lyrical poems she had read, she had no experience at all.\\" Yet there is not a hint of self-consciousness, innocence, or inexperience as waves crash against the shore in perfect ecstasy. This was so gratuitous, so absurd, and so out of step with the characters and the time. This was the first instant either of them had acknowledged to each other that they even had any feelings for each other. They'd barely even realised it themselves. This was enough. Plotwise, Briony could still misinterpret a passionate embrace. Even just a kiss to demonstrate the radical new turn in their relationship could have been painted powerfully and convincingly. But this daydream nonsense? Puh-leaase.<br /><br />I'm not so sure about the `story within the story' final part (much as in the last book I read, [[ASIN:B003R50AW8 The Messenger]], which has something similar.  Indeed, I'm getting a bit over this as Foer's [[ASIN:0060529709 Everything Is Illuminated: A Novel]] was also a recent read). Yes, there's some interest in throwing around questions about how an author may mix biography and fiction, but unless McEwan himself is widely known to have been involved in similar events, the Briony as author/unreliable narrator thing is purely to be judged on whether it works as fiction. It's a device, and importantly a surprise ending device. It does work in some ways to have us re-evaluate the previous events, but does this re-evaluation add to the pleasure and the impact of the novel? I don't really think so. It actually made it harder for me to care for the characters as the book challenges your suspension of disbelief (`Briony' has altered events, challenging the credibility of the previous three parts) - but then wants you to double it (`Briony is still a character we're supposed to believe in as an author closely linked to the events of the previous parts). The only book I can currently think of which successfully incorporated an `author' into the narration, even blurring the lines between the `real' author, was Primo Levi in [[ASIN:0349100330 The Wrench]]. To quote myself:<br />'Rather than remain invisible and let `Faussone' do all the talking, the listener/narrator is also allowed to take on a role - the stories are clearly placed in a setting of Faussone talking to the semi-autobiographical persona of Levi. We learn a little of why he's putting down these stories, his own speculation on whether writing is a worthy `craft' compared to that of the tradesman, and he even drops in a work story of his own (as a chemist - Levi himself was a chemist) to conclude. Levi highlights the importance of the listener and the context to the stories, which, while entertaining enough to stand on their own, are enhanced by tangents of setting and response. Moreoverthere's room for just a little plot and relationship development winding alongside the stories.'<br /><br />In the Wrench this element is integrated. In Atonement it feels a bit like a trick: didn't McEwen think the story strong enough to stand on its own?

The way the characters were drawn were ok to me (except for Claire's Double D's). I did have trouble trying to tell who was who since all the men look alike. The whole story just didn't flow right and was changed to much. I just didn't get it.

I just found one scene to be really unbelievable.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Katie and Micah seem to live in a bubble... No friends. No family. No neighbors... and even though Micah is a Day Trader, he never seems to work... its really their personal and social life that is haunted. We have to go through 20 some odd nights before the denouement which does make the hairs stand up on the back of ones neck, however it does not make up or compensate for the lack of the aforementioned character development. Paranormal Activity does offer some thrills and is a great example of a truly independent film made on a shoestring budget and certainly a cut above Blair Witch Project. Overall, great directorial debut for 1st time filmmaker Oren Peli, however the scariest aspect of this film is that it does not live up to its hype.

Four stars is a fair rating in my opinion.    When the series was being televised, I heard some complaining, bordering on whining in one case, that the series was \\"no Band of Brothers,\\" i.e. boring. I appreciated The Pacific's lack of treacly sentiment- something  that came through in Band of Brothers- my opinion of course. In the interest of disclosure, some of my compatriots are easily bored, and the non-battle sequences were clearly equivalent to walking on hot coals for them- some of these guys can't watch a movie without yakking on their Smartphones several times throughout. If you have attention deficit, maybe steer clear of trying to watch this.    Thanks to the producers and directorial staff for trying to make a fair account of how the Marines lived, loved, wondered about their futures, and fought a vicious enemy in often appalling conditions. I won't minimize the sacrifice of these men by complaining that depictions of their lives don't have enough action. I thank my lucky stars that I never had to go through anything like it.

The story starts in London, but the pair move around the glove during their lives apart     The two have hit or miss episodes during their relationship, they almost get together for good, but something always stands in the way. For example, Emma finds herself working in a play, and Dexter goes to India. His intent is to meet Emma there but the plans get thwarted. The two later meet in Geneva, and the reader would expect the couple to finally come together, but it is no love connection for most of the time for the story. One of them eventually falls for someone else, and all appears to be lost.    The couple does care for each other, even when one person cares more than the other. Dexter's fame in the television industry changes his attitude towards life, as does Emma's lack of success as they both approach middle age. The story is contemporary in that it shows two people from different social backgrounds and how they manage their feelings for each other over time. but it has the classical underpinnings of a couple who share a physical, emotional or spiritual connection, but all at different and mixed times throughout the \\"life\\" of their complicated relationship. Their feelings reflect their other lives, and it is interesting to watch how these feelings and emotions change over time. The book is a good read for any age.

B002RKSZKI|3.0|Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite.  The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her.  It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived.  If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading.
B001US29I2|5.0|This takes a long time to build (several days) and my 9-year old needed help.  The actual official designed structure is not durable.  It falls apart into its Lego pieces easily.  But the individual Lego blocks can be used to build all sorts of things for years and years. We have already taken the orginal structure apart and made our own vehicles and planes for the figurines.  It is lots of fun to use creatively.
B003VMIGM8|3.0|Atom Egoyan is one of my favorite directors, but the original version of this movie--a 2003 French film called \\"Nathalie\\"--is much better. Egoyan, though Canadian in upbringing, has managed to \\"Hollywoodize\\" the story here...complete with a kind of blockbuster-y BIG ending, which is unnecessary. The original film is far more subtle, nuanced all the way through, and more of a psychological study that keeps you guessing. \\"Chloe\\" comes off as a thriller with a typical storyline & even predictable twists. Along these same lines of contrast, it is interesting then to note that the French version is directed by a woman: Anne Fontaine. Anyway, I recommend \\"Nathalie\\" instead. The female lead in that one--although I love Julianne Moore--is the very beautiful Deneuve-like Fanny Ardant. Or better yet, if you like Atom Egoyan, as I do--he captures Canada SO WELL--and are looking for a GREAT film, try \\"The Sweet Hereafter.\\" It's one of my top five favorite movies of all time.

0399536108|5.0|Chris Guillebeau is one of those remarkable individuals who stops to ask important questions in life.  The most remarkable thing about him, however, is that he isn't much different from any of us.  The biggest difference is that he decided to live life on his own terms and he never gave up that dream.    As someone going through his own struggles with living an unconventional life, I look up to Chris and I appreciate his words and advice.  I met him in person last year and he is a rare person, one who has the ability to make everyone around him feel important.    If you have ever questioned whether or not a so-called \\"normal\\" life is for you, read Chris' book or read his blog.  It may be the best thing you ever did.
0230744761|4.0|Moving between 1941 and the early 1990s, Morton connects mother, daughter and mystery in the long unraveling of a family tragedy. Much of the critical action takes place at Milderhurst Castle during World War II, where three sisters live with a father made famous by his terrifying novel, The True History of the Mud Man. A truly gothic tale, Raymond Blythe's seminal work has earned him popular cache, even as the years pass and he retires to a reclusive life in the tower of his castle. The family history has been marred by premature, violent death, bodies falling from the tower or burned beyond recognition as the family library is engulfed in flames. The Blythe sisters, Persephone, Seraphina and Juniper, carry on the legacy bequeathed them, bound together by Juniper's lost lover, an event that alters her life.<br /><br />During the years of the blitz in London, many mothers opt to send their children to the country to be temporarily sheltered by volunteer families. Thus does an impressionable Meredith arrive in the village, carried home to Milderhurst Castle by the exotic Juniper. Meredith flourishes in her new environment, exposed to art and literature, her world expanded by the sisters in their darkly romantic castle, Juniper in particular. Fifty years later, Edie Burchill, Meredith's daughter, returns to the castle, hoping to uncover a past her mother has never talked about. Soon past and present collide as Edie tenaciously investigates the wartime events, unearthing as well a vault of family secrets. Now elderly and frail, the sisters inhabit a crumbling castle, Percy and Saffy attending a more fragile Juniper.<br /><br />Morton makes use of letters, diaries and Raymond Blythe's novel to draw her readers into a labyrinthine world of long-buried sins, the voices of the dead longing for release: \\"Evil on itself shall back recall (Milton).\\"  The gothic tale of Blythe's Mud Man yields an atmosphere both moody and moldy, a filled-in moat, a little girl starring from the tower room on a stormy night. On a lighter note, Edie's exertions are on her mother's behalf, the daughter seeking to restore the bond that seems to have disappeared. Even with the fresh perspective of youth, Edie is seduced by the time-worn Milderhurst Castle and the Blythe sisters as Meredith was fifty years before. Although some rigorous editing would not be remiss, gradually everyone's stories are exposed to the light of day, long-hidden secrets revealed, a family held captive by a tale of horror, their darkest fears based on an awful truth.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|First, the positive: I am quite pleased with the GPS performance of this watch and with and the computer interface (the ANT+ stick and agent).  The watch reliably connects with my computer when it's within range, downloads the data to the computer, and the software automatically uploads the data to Garmin Connect.    Now the negative: I purchased this watch in February 2010.  By April, the rubber strap broke and the buckle came off.  I contacted Garmin and they immediately send out a replacement strap, though in the meantime I had switched to the velcro strap which comes with the watch (and I've continued to use that strap ever since).      About a month after the strap broke, one of the spring contacts on the charging clip failed, so I could no longer charge the watch.  Again, I contacted Garmin and they quickly sent me a replacement.      Some time after that, the watch started behaving erratically.  Specifically, the screen would occasionally go blank (while I was running), the watch would refuse to charge or would begin charging and when I was ready to use it, I would find that it was completely discharged, the watch would lock up and require a reset, and other frustrating behavior.  Tonight I spent about an hour cleaning the charging contacts, jiggling the charging clip, and basically playing around with the watch until I finally was able to get it to start up again and begin charging, only to find that it had once completely discharged, despite having been in the charger all day long.    Needless to say, I am very frustrated.    Beyond my particular problems, there are several other issues with this watch which would keep me from purchasing it again.  First, the touch interface is lousy; sometimes it's a hair trigger, other times it completely refuses to respond.  Second, while getting data to Garmin Connect is fairly easy, Garmin Connect itself leaves much to be desired and despite the fact that Garmin upgraded Garmin Connect once while I've been using this watch, they've basically ignored customer requests for fixes and features (obvious things like having the Activities Map default to your location instead of random places around the globe).    I'm sorry to say that this will probably be the last Garmin product I purchase (I've been a loyal Garmin customer for over a decade, but their quality seems to have deteriorated now that they've moved to consumer electronics).

I considered buying this but when I saw in the contents page chapters like what is exposure, then when I read Kceezie review I knew the book was below my skill level but looked great for a beginner.    Some books really do need to list the level or student or user that a book is for. An astronomy book might be great for a first time telescope user but someone getting  his second bigger telescope needs to lnpw the book is geared to the more experienced telescope user or the first time user. Same with a photo how to book. Kceezie review convinced me to look for a more advanced book.    All instruction manuals should or rather need to includrd skill level.    Thanks    RB
1449389627|5.0|Innovation is mainly hard work. The first 2/3 of this book cover the historical context of many inventions or major changes commonly referred to as innovative. In the selected cases, the author digs up fantastic anecdotes of how there was far more hard work leading up to the invention -- and in many cases after as well! -- than we think of today when we mention the works of people like da Vinci, Einstein, or Newton. This insight into the past is particularly encouraging for me as a current graduate student. It's easy to feel like I'm just slogging away on several problems, some of which may pay off but many of which won't. While I don't claim to be in the same camp as the greats of the past, at least I know that this work is something they had to go through as well.<br /><br />Scott's insights on the role of management as a protector of early-stage creativity and later as the driving force on execution are fantastic and, I think, easily lost in a casual reading of the book. I spent several years (also at Microsoft) managing a small team working on big-change items -- a completely new text editor, a new architecture for assembling applications, etc. Nearly all of it turned into shipping products in one form or another. But, at the time I was managing this work, I felt like all I was doing was carefully shepharding my team to protect them from the madness of a larger team focusing (rightly!) on incremental execution and aiding them in choosing when to change from prototyping to building shipping software. It's nice to get some reassurance that I happened upon at least one of the right ways. I wouldn't mind hearing more anecdotes about the smaller context in which many inventions happen in a future work! It's easy to hear about the 3M innovation policy from the top and at the leaves, but it's at the relatively unspoken mid-levels -- which write the performance reviews and provide the daily feedback -- where such efforts fly or die.<br /><br />In the interests of full disclosure, I was provided a complimentary copy of this book.provided a complimentary copy of this book.

0938045768|4.0|First: Buy the book directly from Dragon Door; it's much cheaper on their website.    Anyone who's spent some time around the fitness industry -- especially those who prefer to stay out of \\"mainstream fitness\\" -- knows that if you do anything for a while, you'll hit a plateau.    The brilliance behind the progressions of CC is that you are working the same muscles in a different way each time you move to the next difficulty level for a given muscle group -- and each exercise progression is specifically included to help get you to the final movement.    A case-in-point: regular pull-ups are step #5 on your way to 1-arm pull-ups. Steps 6 and 7 point you in an intentional direction to focus on the weaknesses that most people will have while only working on steps 1-5.    Testimony: Following the \\"Young Blood\\" program was, at first, something I scoffed at. However, I recognized that it was a scaled-down version of one of the programs that Purposeful Primitive included. I started out on May 25th doing my first pushup workout with a whopping 10 reps (regular pushups are Step #5 in the pushup progressions). Following the Young Blood protocol, in 1.5 months (July 12th) I went from 1x10 to 2x20. Less than a month after that (August 11), I hit 2x20 in Step #6.    Having shed my gym membership, this book has been a godsend to providing me with a workout template and the necessary bodyweight exercises and progressions to implement into my fitness regimen, especially since I have started getting rid of some of the unused equipment that I have at home.
0765356139|2.0|I bought the entire trilogy at once and wish I had not. This middle book is so boring. The first 500 pages or so of the book has the characters waiting around and doing nothing but being all emo, or trying to be political. However, the politics is boring and unsatisfying, and I read fantasy books because I want fantasy action and adventure, not to read about some moron king who can't even do politics.  I kept reading, wondering \\"where is the well of ascension\\" ???     Compared to the Night Angel trilogy (which I also bought all at once and did not let me down), this middle book really disappoints.  In the Night Angel trilogy, the middle book has a strongly evil villain reminiscent of a \\"empire strikes back\\" sort of feel, whereas this book spends 500 pages waiting around in a non-threatening, boring situation. The main character's (Vin) excessive emo and insecurity makes you just want to quit the entire book.  In the Night Angel trilogy's middle book you get a good feel for the \\"Vi\\" character, who has alot of issues but doesn't like in Well of Ascension make the reader hate her for having to slog through 500 pages of emo self-disgust; in this book you have to for \\"Vin\\", and this is what makes this book in my consideration a failure.    Also the title is mis-leading and a misnomer. I don't know what the author was thinking -- he should have cut the first 500 pages into 100 pages and then added more content that actually has to do with the title.     Also, Elend also spends 500 pages in self-emo-pitying disgust, and is 10x more annoying than Vin (who is also already very annoying). Kelsier was a much better character (similar to Durzo Blint of Night Angel).
0060920084|4.0|Bill Bryson takes you along on a tour of America, in a Chevette.  Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Seriously though, this book is interesting because it focuses on the small towns that make up the united states. Bryson delves into what makes a \\"perfect\\" town and eventually decides that such a thing probably doesn't exist.  The book came out a while ago so some of it feels a bit dated but its that good kind of dated, like hearing a song from your childhood on a car's stereo as it drives by.  Nostalgic with a touch of cynicism.  In other words, a good book to read while feeling contemplative. Or when planning a roadtrip.
0780622650|3.0|This movie could have been so much better. The first half of the film was good, but after they escape those spider things (which weren't really that menacing) the movie goes kinda downhill from there. It's like the guy who was writting the script had a massive heart attack, died, and the guy they repalced him with had no idea what he was doing. The acting was alright, but the movie relied too much on special effects that would become dated.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|Looking at the other two \\"Toy Story\\" movies, yes, there are definite repetitions, but \\"Toy Story 3\\" expands the story beautifully into emotional frontier many other animated sequels don't dare.     Every time a Pixar film comes out, the buzz is initially about how far off the deep end the animation studio has gone. \\"How can you make a movie about a dirty, filthy rat aspiring to be a gourmet chef without the film being the cinematic equivalent of an emetic?\\" \\"Seriously, a movie that begins in silence and a dead earth?\\" \\"A children's movie that touches on a miscarriage and old age mortality?\\"     My misgivings about \\"Toy Story 3\\" were far graver than those for \\"Ratatouille,\\" \\"Wall-E,\\" or \\"Up.\\" Instead of exploring bold emotional or aesthetic territory, it seemed that Pixar was treading into the familiar streets of Sequelville along with Dreamworks and Fox with their respective \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Ice Age\\" franchises.     The Monument Valley action opener was extremely amusing, but did not dispel my concerns as the sequence was very similar to the video game opening of \\"Toy Story 2.\\" Like the first two movies, Buzz the spaceman (voiced by Tim Allen), Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks), Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Hamm the piggybank (John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Mr and Mrs. Potatohead (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), and Slinky Dog (Blake Clark filling in for Jim Varney) embark on an odyssey away from Andy (John Morris) where they meet new toys.     This time around Andy is grown up and heading off to college. He plans on taking Woody (more as a sentimental token than as a plaything) and leave the rest of the toys in the attic (something the toys consider to be a comfortable retirement). Through a mix-up and misunderstanding, they end up at a day care. What they initially take for a paradise, they find is really a prison run by a superficially friendly and menacing plush bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) and a possibly more-than-metrosexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton). In the \\"caterpillar\\" room the gang is notoriously abused, their movable parts torn apart, bodies painted and glittered, body-parts crammed into every possible facial orifice.     The second act plays like a prison break film and in tone matches the other two films excellently. Like the other two films (or most other Pixar films) it displays a wonderful wit and all the characters new and recurring are in top comical form.     After the gang flees the day care, the film turns incredibly dark and dire. The movie explores obsolescence throughout, but in the last act the characters face death as they have not done before. The result is extremely gripping and affecting, whether as the result of a terrific build-up in a terrific movie or the result of spending 15 years and nearly five emotionally charged animated hours with Andy's toys.     The end runs a little too long beyond the climax, though not nearly as overlong as the denouement to \\"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.\\" I mention \\"Return of the King,\\" because, like the third installment of that fantasy franchise, \\"Toy Story 3\\" attempts to find the happy medium between a conclusion to one movie and a conclusion to a trilogy.     All three \\"Toy Stories\\" work well singly or as one whole story. Pixar has pulled off its fourth absolute winner in a row (performing this feat, perhaps they can make me care about \\"Cars 2\\" next year). I would even venture to say that \\"Toy Story 3\\" belongs with other great cinematic sequels like \\"The Dark Knight,\\" \\"Return of the King,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" possibly even \\"The Godfather: Part II,\\" all movies that effectively expanded and completed the story and themes begun in the movies they followed. \\"Toy Story 3\\" stands out from the rest of the pack of sequels as the only one that was able to do it with characters made of plastic.    As to the blu-ray as a package, I can't rightfully review, but my two favorite blu-ray review sites gave it superb scores in video and audio and supplements. For further reading, see  and . The only supplement I may comment intelligibly about is the short \\"Night and Day,\\" which, though I found the storytelling incredibly awesome (the mixture of 2-D and 3-D in theater worked excellently), I was nonplussed about some telling-not-showing toward the end and a pretty predictable arc. The best short in Pixar's post-Cars winning streak is easily \\"Presto.\\"

B002VPE1AW|3.0|Avatar (2009).........CGI at its finest.  You'll see the latest computer generated image technology.  This movie is visually stunning, in some cases breathtaking, but the story suffers while the special effects are on display.  George Lucas once said, \\"A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing\\".  Years after he said that, he went on to make the Star Wars prequels, which were heavy on special effects and CGI while the stories suffered.  I like the prequels, but they don't compare to the original trilogy.  It seems that James Cameron has fallen into this mode as well, at least in this film.  Great movie visually, mediocre story.<br /><br />This movie will make you feel like you're watching a video game.  It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, especially Episodes I and II, and also King Kong (2005).<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie?  I guess so.  Sorta.<br /><br />If you like this sort of stuff, then...<br /><br />INSERT COIN - 25 cents.
0316069485|3.0|I was going to download this to my Sony Reader, but I wasn't about to pay $14.99, so I got it from the library.  I'm glad I did.  I have read all of Connelly's books and this one was disappointing.  The story was too heavy on the courtroom scene and he can't tell a courtroom drama like John Grisham.  It seemed at the end that Connelly remembered that Harry Bosch was in this one and turned it into a detective story.      The story never grabbed you and made you want to read more, like his other books.  I hope he isn't going the way of other writers, like Stuart Woods, and just popping out a book a year to make the deadline on his contract.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|[[ASIN:B003Y74M2S Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire Story]]    ...and claustrophobic. I could only read this in small sittings. The book does a good job of capturing a horrific and newsworthy situation and, if anything, made the reality that much worse. On one hand, it humanizes the headlines. On the other, I had a very difficult time getting through it. Just personl taste I guess. I generally read to escape and, like the main characters' surroundings, this narrative was suffocating.

B000SEVVLK|3.0|Interestingly enough I LOVED this book when it came out a couple of years ago. BUT this weekend I couldn't find anything new I wanted to read to I figured I'd re-read a book I like the first time I read it, however, it seems I didn't figure on having matured since I read it last. I really didn't think I'd changed from when I was 24 to 26, but it seems somewhere along those years I matured without knowing it. It is the only reason I can think of to explain my change of mind regarding this book.  The first time I read it I felt just like the other reviewers who liked it. That it was funny and interesting, etc. Now, I can't believe that I actually liked it.   One character has what seems like the perfect life (a job she loves a promotion on the horizon and a sweet, handsome, famous, rich AND sensitive man who loves her) however, she is constantly whining about her life and even at one point thinking that she feels violated by her boyfriend's touch and having sex with him. YET, she still stays with him!!!    Another character is a serial monogamist who is devastated when her boyfriend of 5 years dumps her for younger woman. That of course doesn't seem like strange thing except the boyfriend was constantly cheating on her and according to one of her friends, always carried the card for his favorite escort service in his wallet. After being dumped and her friends succeeding in convincing her that having only had sex with 3 different men who were all boyfriends she decides to go on a Tour de Whore.     The last character is lacking in just that... character! She might be beautiful and she might rival the Victoria's Secret models in sexiness, however, she is so selfish and unconcerned with anything that doesn't revolve around her looks that I was left feeling that there's nothing there. The first two women I could scratch together a bit of sympathy with if I strained myself, however, the last one whores her way around New York and seems to think that is just dandy. She lives in her parent's apartment (but resents them for using it when they are in NY), she doesn't work, her parents pay all her bills and yet again she resents that her mother interferes in her spending ($10.000 for clothes and another $10.000 for travel in one month is apparently not any of their business). While I am not a prude (Sam in SATC is my favorite character! But unlike this character she had a job and a life she'd made for herself instead of mooching of off her family!!!), the simple fact that she sleeps with married men without any thought made me actively dislike her, all the other stuff is just added on to my dislike.    I am 26, yet I feel WAY more mature than these three women!!! How am I supposed to relate to them when there is nothing there?! They never seemed to have left their teenage years behind!    I've given it 3 stars because I did love it the first time I read it.

Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, had been surprised by Salander's odd talents.<br /><br />This is the second in a sort of trilogy, (the late author planned to produce more than the three books published to date).  Lisbeth's adventures in the first book created enemies.  One, in this episode, joins forces with some of the officials who are seeking to find the cause of three unexplained deaths.<br /><br />Prior to that point, Blomkvist learns, during a weekly planning meeting at the magazine, MILLENNIUM, that Erika Berger, the editor, is inclined to have one themed issue focus on trafficking.  A freelance journalist has a book and an article to offer to the magazine.  Blomkvist is to be the editor of the book.<br /><br />This is a wonderful piece of fiction.  The reader is immediately caught up in the travails of the girl.  The deep appeal of all three books in the series is that it is something of a Cinderella story, even a superman story, for that matter.  Lisbeth Salander is a true underdog, someone whose gifts are not properly valued, who prevails against a veritable mountain of obstacles to survive.  Most people are not positioned as far outside of the human community as she is, but everyone, in some small way,  has been put in humiliating circumstances, bested unfairly, felt alienated, been misunderstood, and so forth.  There is universal capacity to identify with such a heroine.<br /><br />The author has produced an interesting, multifaceted mysterious plot of excitement, charm, and bite to dazzle the reader.  Throughout much of the book the journalists and Lisbeth are operating on separate but linked tracks.  A number of strands to the story are pitched and then converge.  Each line of inquiry is interesting in and of itself.  This is a cliff hanger.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Sorry, but I thought this was a truly lousy movie. Lots of same old, same old - nasty new age russians, nasty CIA types. Jolie looked ridiculous as a blonde for the first 2 reels, then she \\"dyed\\" her hair to become the AJ we know and love. But why do the Americans have so little faith in their own government? Their security services are almost invariably cast as duplicitous, conniving manipulators. Lots of action, but - to me at any rate - ultimately soulless, predictable and, worst of all - dull.
