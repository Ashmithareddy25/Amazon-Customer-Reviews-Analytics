B00000JSJC|5.0|\\"Strange Days\\" stars the incomparable Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Lewis as former lovers in a futuristic, bent-for-hell society.  Fiennes plays Lenny, whose career is selling vicarious, virtual reality experiences to people.  They experience these by putting on headsets with tapes that Lenny has culled from his underworld contacts.  Things turn even uglier when a serial killer gets turned on by making his own tapes of his murders, while they are being committed, and sends them to Lenny.  Lenny tries to rescue Lewis from the even darker underworld people she now lives with but it is an uphill battle.  This is one of my favorite Ralph Fiennes performances plus Bigelow at the top of her game.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000002N2Z|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am not an easy man to please when it comes to rock music.  Don't get me wrong, however; I love a lot of the music that fits itself into the genre.  In other words, many bands have found a way to please my tastes.  One of these bands is Deftones.  More specifically, Deftone's Adrenaline album.  Typically I look for bands that touch the more sentimental and harmonic side of rock while incorporating hard riffs and ear slaughtering screaming...sort of a mixture of water and oil finding a way to combine into a homogeneous solution.  Although Deftones stayed more on the heavier side of things in Adrenaline, they did throw in some quiet sung lyrics as well to lighten up the mood.  Regardless of the band satisfying my usual desire in rock music 100%, they certainly fed a sweet, sweet dessert to my ears.  Now go buy the album!
B000000H40|5.0|Obituary was a very infuencial deathmetal band from the mid to late 80's. I have a couple of thier cd's but I believe this one is thier best. I mean come on James Murphy from Testement is on this cd it can't be bad.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radioheads new album HAIL TO THE THIEF is truely a masterpiece of music perfection. At first the CD did little for me with the exception of 2+2=5 and Backdrifts. After attending a Radiohead concert and hearing the music live I realize how great this music actually is. I urge you to buy and listen a few times to appreciate the Radiohead experience.<BR>This album is not the easier rock-n-roll sound of the Bends. Hail to the Thief is a masterful mix of the electronic crisp sound of Kid A and the rock sound of Ok Computer. The innovative sound of Amnesiac is also incorporate. The lyrics are also very interesting without thinking of thier deeper meaning.<BR>I would suggest this CD for anyone who enjoys appreciating music at a higher level. Congrats to Radiohead for their newest album.
B0000399WI|5.0|Wondeful movie... very graphic, if your not into what goes on behind the prison bars, then this movie is not for you. I loved the ending! It was the perfect revenge.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Television shows come and go.  Some I've liked, and some I haven't.  But none of them stole my heart like Firefly did.  I'm still amazed at how much I love this show.  I understand how people probably feel about diehard fans.  They think we're nuts.  I know some people think, \\"meh, it's only a TV show.  It was good, but still only a TV show.\\"  While that is true, I have to wonder why the fate of this show is still so important to so many of us.<br />At first I thought I'd finally gone crazy.  And maybe I did.  However, there are a lot of other people here with me.  I recall reading what a lot of people wrote about how this was also the first time they'd ever been so invested in a show before.  Were we hypnotized?  If so, why were so many other people immune?  What is so special about Firefly?  What is it about this show that made us all fall so in love?  The writers, the cast, the crew, the fans - we were all taken in.  Surely there's a logical explanation.<br />Could it be the cast?  They are pretty.  Each and every one of them is his or her character in front of the camera, so we know they're talented.  But I can see them in other things.  It's not like any of them have never or will never work again.<br />Perhaps the sets?  The \\"realism\\" of a spaceship that actually has crappers on board?  And showers and sinks and food in cans?  Towns that aren't all neat and pretty, and yet have holographic windows on the bars?<br />Is it Joss?  I love his work, and I adore Buffy, but the show coming to an end somehow felt right to me.  It had a good run, and I feel like the story was told by the last \\"grr, argh.\\"  Angel is also on my \\"can't miss\\" list, but I wouldn't weep and whine and mourn if it went away either.  Maybe Joss has so much love for this project that it spread like some crazy spell.<br />Sometimes I wonder if all of us felt there was something we had in common with one or more of the characters that made us \\"bond\\" with them subconsciously or something.  It's certainly true for me.  Some of the lines and the way they were delivered felt like they came from me.  Have some of us been to Serenity Valley?  Or played with dinosaurs?  Did some of us wake up one day and feel like we were naked and frozen in a box, with no idea what was going on?  Or betray ourselves because \\"the money was too good\\"?  Were we ever impressed by all the shinies only to be treated like some kind of freak for not wearing the \\"right\\" dress?<br />Maybe we love the show because it's not about a bunch of people on a spaceship.  Maybe we love the show because it's about us.<br />If you haven't seen the show yet, check out the DVDs.  I am sure you'll find at least a little piece of yourself in Serenity.  And you won't want to leave, either.
B000099T2L|4.0|I must say that I was not a big fan of Beyonce or Destiny Child, due to the fact that I am old school to the heart.  Purchased this CD for my 11 year old, heard a few tunes.  I must admitted that it is worth purchasing.  This young lady can sing, y'all!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This new group is phenomenal!  I can't speak high enough for them and this album.  Amy's voice is exceptional and the lyrics are truly heart wrenching as well as haunting and speak to the soul.  The band truly works exceptionally well together and compliment each other.<br />Some albums can be a disappointment when it's only one or two songs that are successful, but the entire album is completely inspiring.  Nothing but praises from me!
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs the movie on DVD is awesome!  Hilarious parody based on Starwars that will defintely make you laugh vigorously!  Arguably Rick Moranis' finest performance!  And Mel Gibson directs and acts amazingly!  If you're looking to remember some lines to share with some friends, this one has plenty!  Truly a comedy everyone will remember and enjoy!  A must see!
B00006LI4S|3.0|Well, I love and always have loved dave. I guess  I was a little taken back by the mostly acoustic guitar work. David you are a great and worthy axe man. But missed the howl that from the strat.  On another note. The disc has wonderful sound, great  colour and makes your dvd player a useful item. There is only one david and the voice and the talent are there without a doubt. Just wished it had a little more energy. Electric that is,
B00005JKZV|5.0|The first two installments of this movie were so well done.  Although they did not exactly follow J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpieces, the essence of his story was there and probably comes as close as any movie can to following such an involved tale in a book.  I was impressed with the care taken in the special effects to make Middle Earth come alive and all the actors were well-placed and believable.  What great story-telling!! I highly recommend this series of movies for the whole family; although little ones might be frightened by the monsters.
0312199066|5.0|I couldn't put it down. <BR>This is an action-packed book, that brings you right into the cockpit of several of our space capsules and outside of them during an EVA.<BR>He speaks about his carreer before the space program, how he got into it, and then how life is changed forever.<BR>In his matter-of-fact style, Cernan speaks about several of our space-heroes and how he views and interacts with them.<BR>Cernan describes the lunar landscape, his thoughts and feelings while he was there... makes you see it through his eyes.<BR>If you like action, aviation, flying, space, this will be one of your favourite books ever.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|After listening to this album I realized I had just been given one of the greatest gifts. Each song is a special package in itself with Lindsey Buckingham at his best and Stevie Nicks continuing to provide us with unbelievable lyrical prose. When you pair the talent of these two you get something with more depth and more substance than anything we are hearing today. Buckingham's &quot;Murrow...&quot; speaks of today's media control. Nicks' &quot;Illume&quot; speaks of the horrow of Sept. 11th. After addressing the issues of our country they address the issues that have loomed over their personal and professional relationship with such songs as &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;. Buckingham continues to show his worth as his guitar screams out though songs such as &quot;Come&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;Red Rover&quot; while Nicks calls to us with her luring voice through songs such as &quot;Smile At You&quot;, &quot;Thrown Down&quot; and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; she continues to rock through &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;; the latter being one of her best in years. When you take these songs and add that secure and strong rhythmic base from Fleetwood and McVie you have a complete package and some wonderful music that you will want to share with everyone you come into contact with. So, &quot;Say You Will, Say You Will..&quot; !!!
B0000541AM|4.0|The Warriors is a really awesome movie. The only bad part is the DVD version doesn't have the deleted scenes that were on Joe Bob's show a few years ago. Put those scenes in the movie and I'll give it a 5.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and couldn't wait to get the soundtrack.  I was not disappointed.  The music was strong and stirring - it made me feel as if I was right there with Johnny Depp swash buckling side by side.  This music is inspiring, with plenty of punch.  This soundtrack captures the essence of the movie; with the sound dark when necessary, soft when appropriate and gutsy just at the right parts.  I highly recommend this score and my favorite track is Swords Crossed.
B00005JLTN|1.0|The premise behind the Matrix-machines using humans as batteries- is extremely silly. ~takes deep breath~... In reality, each human doesn't even generate enough electrical charge in a whole year to keep a light bulb lit. I'm assuming machines would be smart enough to realize this, and hating humans as much as the AI tried to convey, the machines would simply rid the planet of all these stupid, inefficient life forms and get on with...ummm...whatever...  And if humans retaliated by blocking the sun to try to stop them, the so-called original energy source of the machines, again, the machines would be smart enough to use their last bit of energy to send solar collectors into orbit, and whatever other machines they could get up there, and simply continue on with their campaign of killing off the stinking human menace. But I was willing to forego the unbelievability of that with the first Matrix movie and just sit back and be entertained. It was fun to watch. But in Matrix Reloaded we find just how stupid the AI really is.  Not only is there a \\"bad\\" AI, there is now a \\"good\\" AI.  But the good AI is too dumb to correct the obviously flawed construct, Neo, it has created to save mankind from jumping around in muddy puddles in an orgy of jungle madness,(good lord, save me from this future!).  Instead, it continues to allow Neo to \\"reload\\" and \\"reload\\" and \\"reload\\" the Matrix, ad nauseum, (I'm assuming this is the reason for the name of this film), because Neo would rather save his girlfriend construct than the whole human race....duh.  Hmmm...maybe these stupid machines deserve their fate of trying to glean energy from humans afterall.  I suppose the reason I'm being sooo picky with this second film is the fact that this one was just plain boring.  It was one set-up after another so we could watch Neo fight in special-effects limbo and, ugh...so the Wachowski brothers could stuff their irritating philosophies about what's-wrong-with-YOUR-society and what's-right-about-OUR-ways-to-correct-it, down our collective throats.  I bought the first Matrix DVD but I advise people to not bother with this one--and I have a suggestion for the name of the final pic in this triology-- \\"Matrix: Uninterested\\"
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is cher and this was definately the best.  It was a definate tribute to her last farewell
B00005JKZV|2.0|Three books were given to Peter Jackson under good intentions<BR>Seven months was all he needed<BR>Nine hours to watch<BR>But we were all of us deceived<BR>In the hills of New Zealand <BR>In the wetter studios<BR>The dark lord Jackson<BR>Made in secret a different film<BR>Filled with his variation and greed<br />Ok so maybe I'm being a bit melodramatic but I think I have good right. I for one choose to read the books before I turned 18, and so I did. I even tried my hand at the Silmarillion (shudders). Ok so lets begin, the fellowship of the ring was released with great anticipation and I felt although a few things could have been different it was a good film and stayed at least close to the values of the book. The Two towers is different, very different. The greatest saving grace of the fellowship was Sean Beans fantastic portrayal of Boromir but of course he died, things did not look good.<br /> The opening almost saved the film as Gandalf slaying the Balrog was awesome but unfortunately it slowly dissolved into drivel, from the mysterious warg riders and Aragorns little swim which seems to have been added only to introduce a pitiful cameo by Arwen and it continues. I seem to recall the directors explaining things like Tom Bombadill was taken out of the first film due to time restrictions....so why have they added these parts in. Helms deep was little more than an outpost defended by approximately one hundred men the rest were killed by the wargs (shudders again oh and no women of course, they cant fight) I almost thought the film could have been saved by the appearance of the massed armies but the massively hyped massive engine was not really that impressive. Although I must admit that Gollum was well done, of cause the fact that the deep and ultimately valiant battle between Smeagol and Gollum turned into a joke session. <br />Faramir? Why, why did they do that. I seem to recall he wasn't the embodiment of evil but hey what do I know. <br />I could go into finalthoughts but there is more, Gimly has taken on sort of Jar-Jar Binks character and is the subject of many short jokes. Although it seams that Legolas could take on the entire horde of Morgoth single handily. In one word - Hollywoodised. The tears began to fall when the elves turned up for no real reason other than the elves by nature are impressive. <br />There I think I will stop, as I cannot bear to think about this atrocity any longer. At least the Fellowship was a good film,  if you had read the books or not, I don't believe this one was. Ah well we can wait with baited breath for the Return of the King and the return of scathing reports. <br />Only three things gave this film life in my eyes and that is why it gained two stars, firstly the opening, just like the opening of the fellowship it was grand and exhilarating this goes for the Ent fight also. Two - Haldir, fantastic at least Jackson is getting his death scenes. Three, wurmtounge what can I say the casting guys did get it right some times.<br />(I have a sudden image of Arwen fighting along side the hobits at the gates of Gondor.)<br />Dantanium<br />I apologise for any spelling errors but I'm deeply angered.
1400031354|5.0|I read The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency a few weeks ago, and thought it a very good book. This second installment from Law Professor Smith is perhaps even better, and had me chuckling and guffawing at various passages. Strangely, since I enjoy mysteries, there's less mystery here (basically only two plots, neither of them very mysterious) but you wind up not caring because the characters are so much fun.<br />Precious Ramotswe runs a detective agency in Gabarone, the capital of Botswana. She's a &quot;traditionally built&quot; woman with traditional values, too. She's also got a very modern job, working as a detective in Africa, and investigating things. At the beginning of this book, she's accepted the marriage proposal of Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and there are many complications that ensue, especially when some orphans are adopted into the family.<br />One of the writing tricks that the author uses to give the story quaintness is his use of names. You only read Precious Ramotswe's first name once or twice per book. Instead she's referred to as Mma Ramotswe, the Mma apparently being Mrs. in Botswana. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is never referred to as anything else, anywhere in the book, and their respective businesses, the No.1 Ladies's Detective Agency and Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, are both only referred to by their full names. The result is a sort of quaint pride in accomplishment, tempered with a slightly ridiculous feeling to things. After all, there aren't *two* ladies' detective agencies in Botswana.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and will read the third one soon. The fourth I may wait for paperback (or I may not). But this one's definitely worth the price of admission.
B00006IU73|3.0|Being an old prog rock fan i was excited to get some 90's stuff after reading a lot of these reviews and lists. I am mostly disappointed so far with Flower Kings and Porcupine Tree and find it lacks the edge and tension of the energy rich (drug induced?) stuff from 70's groups like Yes, Gentle Giant and King Crimson. This is my first taste of PT. The production is excellent which led me to buy some of their others and after hearing the earlier patchier stuff i can see now how it all comes together on Absentia (and what they're trying to do-comercially). Maybe its unfortunate Steve Wilson is getting so good at what he does because there is so much raw edginess that is smoothed out here. I think the songs are very well written and appreciate the dark lylrics but i have owned this cd for about a month and honestly im starting to tire of its melodic simplicity (but really loved it for a while). I played it for a fellow ravenous music fan the other day and after a couple of tracks we both looked at each other, popped it out and put on some John Zorn Masada.
B000092ZYX|5.0|It might be that Radiohead is my favorite band, but it appears that they seem to be getting better and better as time goes on. Hail to the Thief is yet another triumph for the band, though awkward at first. HTTT doesn't seem like an album and doesn't go together perfectly like OK Computer and Kid A did, at least during the first few listens, but it is an awesome collection of songs. To me it's a summation of the band's last 4 studio albums (the guitar rock of the Bends, the epic proportions of OK Computer, and the avant-garde electronic experiments on Kid A and Amnesiac), all rolled into one. The vast amount of styles the band delves in makes it sort of like the Beatles' White Album, except not as sprawling, long, or legendary (at least not yet... the Beatles have a good 25 years on Radiohead). <br />Not only is Hail to the Thief a diverse collection of fantastic songs, the lyrical content of the album is significantly profound, with Thom Yorke's lyrics reflecting on a post 9/11 world (the title itself is assumed to be thought of as a reference to the questionable results of the 2000 US presidential election). The first track, &quot;2+2=5&quot; has some politcally conscious lyrics (&quot;Are you such a dreamer?/To put the world to rights?&quot; &quot;Don't question my authority or put me in the dock!&quot;), with the music adding on to the lyrical message, starting out slow w/ a menacing guitar riff and drug programming before exploding into a full-scale hard rock frenzy and Yorke wailing &quot;YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION!&quot; Of course there are many political and personal references strewn across the album, left for listener to decode. <br />The question for Radiohead fans is : where do they go next? Perhaps a trip back to Earth? An acoustic album? A free jazz freakout? Creative stagnation? It is ovious that Radiohead's shtick they've used since OK Computer is running dry, although they did it brilliantly on this album, but I don't think they could do itfor another album. As I said earlier, this seems like a summation of almost everything they have done since the Bends. Either this could mean the grand finale of one of the last decade's greatest bands or a new beginning with a different sound. Either way, Hail to the Thief is an awesome Radiohead album, and one of the greatest albums released since... well... the last Radiohead album.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Once again Radiohead is able to return with a powerful album.  The album is complete.  Here is another album you need to complete the perfect rock album collection.
B000002GK1|5.0|Of all the early 90's Seattle grunge bands, Soundgarden has always been my favorite, with Nirvana following closely behind. However until recently I was only familiar with Superunknown and Down on the Upside, then I decided to buy Badmotorfinger and give it a spin. It's just classic grunge rock. Crunching guitars, bleak melodies, catchy choruses- it's all here. Cornell sounds awesome as usual (IMO he's one of the best rock and roll singers ever), but what really sets this apart from the other Soundgarden CDs is the rythm and groove of the music. It's just so damn heavy. Cameron and Shepherd are in rare form (listen to the drums on &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, they're sick) and Thayil is excellent as always, nimbly going from melodic leads and swirling solos to crunchy grunge riffs.<br />&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was one of the singles off this CD and for good reason. It's catchy and has a great chorus, although after listening to the CD several times I would say it's not even in the top 5 or 6 best songs on the disc. &quot;Outshined&quot; is one of the best songs, an absolutely classic grunge song with a powerful and catchy chorus. &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; features some great Cornell singing but lasts a little too long IMO. &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; is another classic, with a furious guitar riff and some insane drumming. &quot;Face Pollution&quot; isn't one of my favorites but is still a quality song. &quot;Somewhere&quot; has a lighter tone than the rest of the album and is a very catchy song, though it's not really indicative of the Soundgarden sound. &quot;Searching With My Good Eye Closed&quot; is an epic song with more great singing. &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot;, written entirely by Thayil, is probably my favorite song on the CD. It's got a great guitar riff that I never get tired of hearing and the groove the band has on this song is just awesome. After that comes the acoustic &quot;Mind Riot&quot; which is much more timid than most of the other songs on the CD and is a nice change of pace track. &quot;Drawing Flies&quot; sounds like a punk rock song, but it's catchy and has some cool guitar riffs. &quot;Holy Water&quot; is one of my favorites. I love the guitar and Cornell has some good lyrics. The CD ends with &quot;New Damage&quot;, which is a great grunge song. I saw one reviewer describe the song as &quot;apocalyptic&quot;, which is exactly right. It's catchy, too, though.<br />I like this CD better than Superunknown because it's heavier and better than Down on the Upside because that CD has too much filler. In my opinion it's Soundgarden's best CD.
B000002GFC|5.0|This CD is amazing. I am new to Cream and have heard a few songs and I liked what I heard so I decided to pick up this CD. I am now a huge fan of the band.  Eric Clapton does an awesome job with his guitar and vocals and Jack Bruce is also stunning.  Ginger Baker is a great drummer also to make this band so good. This CD (in my mind and I'm sure lots of others) perfect.  I suggest that everyone gets this CD; if you're new to Cream like I was, or if you are a hardcore fan, like me now. You will not be disappointed with this CD.
B00008S2VG|1.0|What can I say....this CD was disappointing from the very first song to the last!  While I've been a Madonna fan for 20yrs now, even I could not ignore the fact that this CD was pure &quot;filler&quot; to keep Madonna in the public's eye while she works on the REAL album that will come out at some point!  Every song is over engineered with no catchy sound...something Madonna is generally well-known for producing.  Overall, the CD-listening experience can be compared to eating a dry rice cake...when what you really wanted was a chocolate fudge cake!  Yes, its a wierd statement to make, but that's my way of saying that this was one of the most unsatisfactory music-listening experiences I've ever had!
0156027321|5.0|I'm not sure if I have ever recommended a book to so many people. I found the story simply amazing. And with a biology degree, I neared the end of the book nearly convinced this must have been taken from a historic event. Wow.
1563899426|5.0|Along with &quot;Y: the last man,&quot; Fables is part of what looks like a second renaissance at Vertigo, and with no must-have titles since Preacher ended, it needed it.<BR>This volume deals with a murder mystery, set in a NYC where fairy-tale characters have secretly come to live, after being expelled from their homelands by a creature known only as &quot;the adversary.&quot; The story drives the background, which is introduced without the need for heavy-handed exposition.<BR>The art is good, with keen attention to background and detail, but, as in most Vertigo books, it's there mostly to supplement the writing, which is fresh and imaginative.
B00009V7RF|5.0|been a fan of all types of music i thought the cd elephunk was a whole lot of soul and heart put into one cd and should be rated more than 5 stars. not ever been fan of black eyed peas i thought that all the song on it set the mood for anything it one that u can take anywhere. i think one of the best songs on the cd is track number 11 &quot;the apl song&quot; just because of the way they put it all together the word are just carzy hot. will.i.am is on of the best writter out there more song writter need to be like him and write bout what really going on in the world. it great that they have join force with justin timberlake for just one song &quot;where is the love&quot; one of the reason why i bought the cd but now i know that it not just for that one song it for the whole cd. one a person who knows anything about music should have it in there colection.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I write this only for remark the work did by Ennio Morricone for the score in this movie, is nothing less than incredible! working with the screenplay before the shooting, he composed all the music, after that, Leone adapted the shooting and acting process to this unforgetable score for recreate this powerfull music!!! this movie is a piece of ART and an enormous achievement for all the people involved in it! Im glad to see this movie coming in DVD!
B000068IEU|3.0|Again with the case of any DVD review, I make it my point to review the DVD content, not the movie.<br />If you are a collector looking for this long-lost classic, it is a great addition. You get the &quot;unrated&quot; version of the film along with director's commentary from Wes Craven himself and a few bonus featurettes. The movie itself is more intense than scary but it's still worth seeing if only for the fact that it was Craven's first film.
0060920084|1.0|Bill Bryson could be a fine writer if he wasnt so enamored with himself. While going on a 36 state trip for most people would be exciting and fun, Bryson makes it out to be the most boring and inane trip of all time. If he had spent a little more time telling us about the wonderful places he visited instead of the many way he can find them unappealing, he would have a fine book. I think he lived in the UK far too long. <BR> Not only was this book a waste of time, it was a waste of his.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Everithing in this movie is incredible,from the story to the special effects. Most people don't like it because they DON'T UNDERSTAND it.
0671015206|4.0|This Book was amazing. Anyone aspiring to get to the top of the food chain needs to read this book. This book shows the importance of hard work and saving. After reading this book i have a totally different outlook on the world, the people i thought were filthy rich i look at now with doubt. This book should be read by every high school senior, it sends them on the way to a prosperous life.
B0000844IT|5.0|The ultimate DVD version of a cult favorite has both versions of the film (one of them is the newly-restored director's cut) and every feature included on earlier VHS & DVD formats so you are pretty much getting every documentary and commentary that Anchor Bay has put out with this movie.<br />Funny thing is I own all three video formats (original Universal video, Anchor Bay's 1999 widescreen, and the original limited edition director's cut VHS) and I also bought the bootleg cut on DVD. That's right. I have now purchased this movie five different times. This one DVD has everything included on the four editions that I already purchased (with the exception of the ability to play on a VCR and give or take a few Universal Studios trailers). If only I hadn't spent over $... on those other four because I got this one for like $....<br />Anyways, this movie is a true cult classic. The third entry in the Evil Dead series with Bruce Campbell going back in time to battle a handful of evil spirits.
0790751089|3.0|This is a story of a brief moment in time, a chance meeting, regrets, reawakened dreams, lust, false perceptions and the desire for passion. This story of a very short acquaintance and affair between a bored housewife and a free-spirited traveling photographer was actually handled very well on film. Clint Eastwood made a believable Kincaid, a loner who had an attraction for and developed a sympathetic companionship with a lonely woman during one of his projects. Meryl Streep, who plays an adulteress in most of her films, has not stretched herself much in that sense, but all that experience also means she has developed the role of infidelity quite well. People even begin to feel her anguish and believe she is justified in cuckolding her husband.<br />Many have said it is a great romantic film (to be sure the beautiful musical score steers you in the direction), but I believe it is actually the antithesis of romance in disguise. It is a thought-provoking film, though. It brings home the careful consideration one should make before marrying, how complacency and/or lack of courage can cost people their deepest dreams and desires, and the misery of self-martyrdom. There are many \\"it is a shame that [he/she did/didn't]\\"s in this movie, which is poignant in itself.<br />The saddest part of this movie is not her \\"sacrifice\\" for her family, but the fact that she hung on to a belief for the rest of her life that the passion shared with a stranger was real love. That kind of passion always lasts best in memories once the realities of everyday activity step into the picture. That she married before she had had enough love interests to understand the nature of momentary lust versus love that endures hardship makes her worthy of pity. I do not believe that after even a few months on the road together that Francesca and Kincaid would have lasted as a couple. Kincaid played with the thought of having a companion and Francesca toyed with the idea of an adventurous life. While they may have developed a friendship during four days, what they truly &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/&gt; all those years was not each other, but the possibilities that the other represented.<br />  I have not been compelled to watch it more than once, which is the reason for the average rating, but the acclaim that it has received has made it an important movie to watch.<br />For the sake of your own peace, though, I'd recommend NOT watching it with your romantic partner... unless you are both involved in an extramarital affair, of course.may have developed a friendship during four days, what they truly &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/&gt; all those years was not each other, but the possibilities that the other represented. <br />  I have not been compelled to watch it more than once, which is the reason for the average rating, but the acclaim that it has received has made it an important movie to watch.<br />For the sake of your own peace, though, I'd recommend NOT watching it with your romantic partner... unless you are both involved in an extramarital affair, of course.
0385509456|5.0|This book is really something. First of all, it's a fantastic summer read -- it could easily be devoured in one sitting, which you probably will, because it's impossible to put down. At the same time, it is rich, provocative, morbidly funny at times, and ultimately incredibly poignant and inspiring.<br />The book's a bit difficult to describe. More accurately, I can give a pretty good description but I'm afraid it won't give you a very good sense of what the book is about. &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; is told from the point of view of an autistic boy, who understands mathematics and science perfectly, but other people (who tell lies and believe in things that aren't true) not at all. When he discovers a neighborhood dog that has been killed with a pitchfork, he decides to make like his hero, Sherlock Holmes, and conduct a murder investigation. I don't want to say any more except that in the process of his investigation, the boy learns much, much more than who killed the dog.<br />The other thing I want to say is that I bawled at the end. The story is told from the point of view of someone who lacks the ability to feel or understand ordinary, messy human emotions -- it's often as though there is a sort of plastic bubble around the boy through which emotion is not allowed to penetrate. The effect of this on _me_, oddly, was to _intensify_ the powerful emotional content of the novel.<br />The portrait of a person with Asperger's Syndrome (the form of autism displayed by the boy) is stunning and unique, and will be of interest to anyone  who knows someone with this condition. But the portrait of humanity in all  its frailty and exaltation is what makes the book truly marvelous, sometimes disturbing, and ultimately, curiously, joyously, uplifting.
0767817486|1.0|Don't you think it's rather odd that the co-author of the book which this movie was based upon, William Hoffer, is the co-author of another book of it's kind, Not Without My Daughter? Apparently William Hoffer hit gold with Midnight Express in the 70's, so he stuck to his formula: Write a sensational, over-dramatic, one sided, racist book for people who don't and will never know anything else about the middle east. There sure is an audience for it in America!<br />Not Without My Daughter was filmed in Israel, with actor mostly from Israel, Midnight Express was filmed mostly with Greek actors. Obviously certain governments funded these movies, they are obviously propoganda.<BR>I don't know which one is more sad, the man who feeds on the racism and ignorance of the masses for money and fame, or the masses of racist and ignorant people that don't care to know any better.<BR>Which country is next Mr Hoffer? When will we see our next sensational hit? We're waiting with our extra large movie-theatre-buttered popcorn in one hand, and the flag in the other.
B00004Y635|1.0|Neve Campbell and goofy David Arquette return for this lousy sequel that makes old school horror fans want to bang their heads on the wall. This time, the rules have changed (of course) as anyone can be killed in &quot;a trilogy&quot; even Neve Campbell's &quot;Sydney&quot;. Sorry to inform anyone with a brain but despite the fact that it advertises that &quot;anything can happen in a trilogy&quot;, it is still a predictable film that follows the same rules as all these other horror movies. Where the last sequel threw in a few surprises, this one is purely predictable and does nothing worthy of note.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor!, or Godspeed You! Black Emperor as they now like to be called, have put out three full lenghts, but this, their second, is by far their best. <BR>    Although it suffers from the same predictability as their other albums (every song builds up to an enivitable crecsendo then dies off), it works. Every track is haunting and the vocal sampling is done perfectly, fitting in seamlessly with the music. <BR>    If you're not sure about buying a double album, check out the first song on the second disc and you'll be convinced.
B00009ATIX|5.0|The word &quot;movie&quot; simply doesn't do justice to this masterpiece of Cinematic Art. The score is graceful and appropriately haunting, yet totally mesmerizing. This is a Love Story of the greatest emotional and spiritiual depth, not a &quot;sci-fi&quot; movie in any traditional sense. If you watch Solaris with that expectation and misconception, you will completely miss the significance of this beautiful and unique film.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Yes, I'll buy this DVD on August 26th. When November arrives, I'll buy the extended version. I'll see Return of the King on December 17th. I've seen the Two Towers four or five times in the theaters, the same for Fellowship of the Ring.<br />And yes I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy many times, since first reading it in the 1970's. Everyone in my family has read the trilogy except my 8 year old. <br />And no, I'm not a purist. And no, I'm not complaining about what Peter Jackson--the director--did or didn't do in the making of this film. I'm simply glad that he did. I never thought that in my lifetime (past 50), I'd live to see Lord of the Rings brought to film in a way that would do it justice. <br />I figured at best another animated movie. Or someone would try to cram the whole trilogy in one film, or at most two films, leaving out half the story. Or they'd film part of the story, then IF it was successful, film another part, a la Star Wars (meaning the characters would either age or be replaced as the tale unfolded--a bit disconcerting when the entire tale is told and watched consecutively at home on DVD later).<br />Do I need to tell you about this DVD? If you haven't seen Fellowship of the Ring, rent or buy that first, because the Two Towers is the middle book of Tolkien's  story (voted best literary accomplishment of the 20th century) and therefore has no real beginning or end, the story concluding with the Dec 17th release of the movie Return of the King.<br />What you will see is an epic story, with epic battles, fought in a glorious land (filmed in New Zealand and each frame digitally enhanced), with characters and peoples with a rich culture and history. Part of Tolkien's genius was that he created separate languages, alphabets, architectures and cultures for elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs and so forth. And director Peter Jackson's attention to the detail is such, that you sense and see rich history and culture behind every character and scene you see. <br />At times it's overwhelming.<br />I don't think you can say this movie is better or worse than the first in the trilogy, Fellowship of the Ring. I personally liked the Fellowship slightly better (a bit more pastoral and musical), my teenagers liked the Two Towers slightly better (a bit more action and a grander scale). In any event, it's all part of the same story, and by August of 2004 both you and I will finally be able to sit down and watch the entire epic unfold on DVD all at one time.
B00000J7I3|5.0|This C.D. is the plate in which every one of the rock bands of the 80's fed from. It was recorded as a demo, and when signed, Elektra thought it would be more cost efficient to remix and release. Meant to be nothing more than a tax write-off, a joke, and proof to the A&R man that signed them that he was an ..., this album created a music revolution that ruled and corrupted the minds of... & excitable teenagers for the next ten years. From the opening riff of \\"Live Wire\\" to the closing howl of \\"On With The Show\\", this is THE definative album of 80's Metal. When all of the other bands were thinking about sex, drugs, and rock n roll, Motley Crue was living it. I also highly suggest \\"Shout At The Devil\\". These are the kind of C.D.'s that still, after 20 years still make the most sinical of all my metal-hating friends, stop, listen and say, \\"O.K., this is great, but the rest of the 80's sucked.\\" The music speaks for its self people. Read the other reviews and find out for yourself. If you are thinking about venturing into the world of rock n roll decadence, this is the be-all-end-all. Also, the extra tracks are long-awaited jewels, that us, Crue fans, have been waiting for forever and will not disappoint. The high points are everywhere, from The haunting \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" to the awesome slide guitar in \\"Piece Of Your Action\\" to the cowbell in \\"C'mon And Dance\\". WAKE UP if you are still living in the 90's and go back to a time when you crank up the volume, rip the knob off, and expierence the bombastic attack of a young, aggresive, naive, band trying to make a demo and ended up with a masterpiece. ENJOY!
B000099T2L|1.0|This cd was bland stale and typical of beonce knowles who has no originality.......she is just tryin to appeal to young kids who think this kind of sleep inducing garbage is cool and ofcourse the ultimate rap hack Jay\\"im a sell out\\" z is associated with this album....maybe his lack of talent is rubbing off on the already largely untalented beyonce !<BR>avoid at all costs <BR>but listen to it if you have trouble sleeping
B000089RVX|5.0|This Cd is amazing. I think it is one of the best CDs out because it has a unique quality to it. Although this is their first major release CD i know there are many more to come out of this awesome awesome band. I love the fact that Evanescence isn't trying to be someone they are not and are just playing their music the way they want to. They aren't worried about people liking them because they know if they do what they love it will pay off. And it does seem like everyone in the band loves being there and creating music. Their lyrics are very different but yet have a sense of relation to anyone who listens to it.<br />Here are some of my favorite songs on this album:<br />Going Under: Their 2nd single off of this album. Upbeat instrumentals with good lyrics. a great way to start off this record. <br />Everybody's fool: This song is upbeat yet has many slow parts which make it sound very beautiful plus a big emphasis on the bass and guitars here in this song. Very Good lyrics 4.5/5<br />My Immortal: My favorite song on this album although it is very slow it is beautiful and very melodic. You can listen to this song a million times and not get tired of this song. It is that pretty.5/5<br />Tourniquet: My second favorite song on this album. This song is more on the heavy side and gets you very energized. By the end of this song Amy Lee(vocals) actually winds up screaming if you listen closely &quot;I want to die&quot;. It's very chilling but it is a song which many can relate to once again.5/5<br />Whisper: A great finish to an amazing album. I love the ending part because what makes this band so unique is the fact that they use a chorus in their background singing latin. It adds so much dinamic and strengh not to mention a bit of originality and it always seems to be just in the right places. 5/5<br />Overall this CD is definately worth getting those are just some of the songs which stuck in my head and i thought about writting. Give this band a listen and i'm sure you will be hooked. Listen to the lyrics of these songs because they are brilliantly writen and thought out.
6302719631|4.0|The movie treatment of Jane Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a sweet, polished version of the rather slight story, one of her lesser works. Katharine Schelsinger does a marvelous job as the wide-eyed, tremulous ingenue who is fascinated with Gothic horror tales of beautiful women held captive by men with evil intentions.<br /><br />  Sent to Bath to spend a season there with friends of her parents,  Katharine relishes her time away from her many siblings and their quiet, provincial home.  Predictably, she falls in love, and after the inevitable false starts and Austin's obligatory, complicated situations involving position and money, she gets her man and finds happiness.  The lavish green landscapes of Britain, the marvelous period costumes, and the lush, dramatic musical score all add to the viewer's pleasure.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" this tale is not, yet it provides an enjoyable diversion.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Over all this was a good movie, not great but all said a solid movie for second tier charater.  I must amit I was a little nervous overall about this movie and the casting of Ben Afleck in the lead role, not tha he can't act but he remined me of Clooney and well we all know how Batman &amp; Robin did.  Ben pulled it off though and despite some weak points in the story, like the fight between Ben and Jennifer and Daredevil being as agile as Spiderman (make it a least a little realilistic).  I also felt that the Kingpin wasn't ruthless enough.  However, all said and done I was entertained and the Dvd is loaded.  I just purchased the DVD and so far it is great.  These are the reason we buy DVD's, features and lots of them, I would have loved to have had a script to screen feature or even a &quot;add your own commentary&quot; feature ala Spiderman, but overall some real good features including some screen savers and some pretty cool DVD Rom features.  If you like action and like to see your hero's a little conflicted about the actions they sometime have to take, then buy this movie.  Except for a few silly moments you could almost forget this is a &quot;comic book&quot; movie.
B000075BFK|4.0|2Pac's newest album gives people another reason to believe he's still alive and yada yada yada. Pac's newest postumous release is another enjoyable set of music. After an eerie introduction &quot;Still Ballin'&quot; kicks it off right. Pac attacks the haters with tracks like &quot;When We Ride on Our Enemies&quot;, and &quot;Changed Man&quot; and plays it down on the insightful &quot;Never Be Peace&quot; and &quot;Mama's Just a Little Girl&quot;. They even squeezed in a &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot; acoustic version featuring Nas, who he's been known to lyrically abuse a number of times. Then there's a second disc. &quot;On My Block&quot; is a sad tale of life, and the touching &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot; touches the heart, as it appears Pac is rapping from heaven. The title track featuring Mr. Biggs is another one of those &quot;deep&quot; Pac songs, and other winning tracks are &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot; and &quot;Fair Xchange.&quot; Even though it is another catalogue of great music,you get the feeling that all of this unreleased material is getting a little old. But it appears 2Pac's career isn't over just yet, as it says in the CD booklet that we can expect another double-CD in the near future. It's a crying shame that we can't just let this man rest; that his so-called &quot;friend&quot; Suge Knight is still mooching cash off of him. But, whatever the circumstances, 2Pac's music will always touch the heart.
B00004R99J|5.0|Brimming with lush animation and an Oscar-winning score, Pocahontas is an emotional tale of love, greed, communal hatred and sacrifice. Along the edge waters of Virginia, Pocahontas, the free-spirited daughter of Powhatan, watches as the mysterious shipload of settlers arrive led by the greedy governor Ratcliff and the courageous Captain John Smith. Along with her friends Meeko, a mischievous raccoon and Flit, a feisty hummingbird Pocahontas develops a strong friendship with John Smith which soon transforms into love. But when tension mounts between their two very different cultures, she must find a way to bring peace between the two communities.<BR>                           <br />The wonderful voice talent and Alan Menken's excellent music help in portraying the magic of this movie. Mel Gibson is exceptional as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith. Irene Bedard is good as Pocahontas and Linda Hunt is the perfect choice for the voice of Grandmother Willow. Christian Bale, Russell Means and David Ogden Stiers lend their respective talents as the voices of Thomas, Powhatan and Governor Ratcliff. The songs are very melodious and well-written (by Grammy winner Stephen Schwartz); the `Colors Of The Wind' being a true masterpiece (which won the Oscar for the best song in 1995).<BR>                            <br />Although historically inaccurate, the movie is unique in its visual style and in the message it conveys to us about love and sacrifice. The emotional depth is something I have never before witnessed in an animated feature. There are scenes which will truly touch your heart. I am a full grown adult, yet tears sting my eyes every time I watch the end. I think the true beauty of the movie lies in the ending. <BR>                     <br />    One more thing, the movie is certainly not for kids or for those who like fun-oriented animated stuff like `Toy Story' or `Shrek'. Although it does provide some humor and light moments, the plot is completely adult-oriented and revolves around communal harmony, which I do not think that kids will like very much. So if you are a real appreciator of emotional and artistic beauty and know the value of true love and sacrifice, go enjoy this movie. As for me, I think it is truly a timeless masterpiece.
B00005ATQF|2.0|Besides this movie being a little unrealistic in the war-front scenes, there is one large problem that I can't get over with this movie, which involves the scene where the fat guy kills the drill seregent.  He obviously chose to go into the Marines, which has the toughest boot camp, even though he must know he isn't apt to do so.  It's not that it's a bad movie, it just leaves you feeling a bit empty afterwards.
B000002KXV|5.0|This is not only Donald Fagans best solo album but one<BR>of the best in the Steely Dan songbook (mabye ever!).&quot;I.G.Y&quot; is<BR>a fantastic hit,the funky dance music of 'Greenflower Street&quot;,<BR>&quot;New Frontier&quot; and the DJ tribute of the tital song are in the very same neigborhood.&quot;The Goodbye Look&quot; is a a witty latin fusion like at Cuba in the early 60's and the &quot;Walk Between The<BR>Raindrops&quot; is a pleasant,jazzy romp.It's a bright,effervesant<BR>collection topped by a production nearly identical to Dan's last<BR>two albums,Fagan's ecomonical keyboards and unbeatable,catchy<BR>songs that invoke the dreams and funny experiences of a New York baby boomer.One of any of Steely Dan's members most accessible<BR>and welcoming albums!
B000099T2L|2.0|I expected a lot out of this CD but there's not much to it and is kind of boring.  The good tracks are:<BR>1. Crazy In Love (featuring Jay-Z)... you all know this one, it's great.  In danger of becoming overplayed, but it's great.<BR>2. Naughty Girl... I like the beat a lot and it's a cool song.<BR>3. Baby Boy (featuring Sean Paul)... probably the next single.  A Middle-Eastern type of beat.  <BR>4. Hip Hop Star (featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown)... A lot of people on here don't like this song but I love it!  The chorus is the best part.<BR>11. The Closer I Get To You (featuring Luther Vandross)... I absolutely LOVE this song!  It is so beautiful!  Excellent job by both!  <br />So, if I were you, I'd just burn these 5 songs off the Internet or someone else's CD, because they're the only songs you'll need to hear, because the others aren't necessary.

0142004235|4.0|I was ready to read a classic and almost at the same time Oprah opened up with this one. (I usually read historicial/romance and needed a change) I have to say there are times when I cannot put the book down and others where the story is exceptionally slow. It is also a dark story, more evil and dissapointment and death then good, even though it gets its point across. I am enjoying it, only 3/4 the way through, but so far, it is so-so. Grapes of Wrath was much better. Hopefully there is a happy ending, but I doubt it.<br />***************************************************************<br />Finished the book, glad I read it and also glad it is over.  The end really picks up speed and is quite entertaining, but the ending is so-so.  Maybe I am missing something, but still liked Grapes of Wrath better.
B0000024UO|4.0|On this fine 1969 set, Texas blues-rocker Johnny Winter is backed by some very authentic blues stars, legendary composer/arranger/bass player Willie Dixon among them, and hugely underrated harpist Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton also makes an appearance. <BR>Also, some of the bass playing is handled by none other than a young Tommy Shannon - later of Stevie Ray Vaughan's backing band Double Trouble.<br />What you think of this will probably depend a little bit on how you feel about Johnny Winter's \\"strangled\\" vocal style, but the music is great. \\"Johnny Winter\\" mixes soulful slow blues (a sizzling rendition of B.B. King's \\"Be Careful With A Fool\\", the horn-laden \\"I'll Drown In My Own Tears\\"), tough electric blues-rock (a take on \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\" and a great, swaggering \\"Leland, Mississippi Blues\\"), and a couple of superb acoustic numbers which show off Winter's masterful slide guitar playing (the Son House-like \\"Dallas\\" and Robert Johnson's \\"When You Got A Good Friend\\").<br />Walter Horton shines on \\"Mean Mistreater\\", Winter himself plays some really excellent blues harmonica on \\"Back Door Friend\\", and younger brother Edgar Winter plays excellent piano on \\"I'll Drown In My Tears\\". Johnny Winter handles all lead and slide guitar duties, and his playing is varied and tasteful as always...fiery without resorting to meaningless shredding.<br />A fine, solid album, and a great purchase for fans of Mr Winter's pure blues records. It is obvious from these reviews (I shall name no names, and certainly not say anything about anybody's reviews being less than helpful, let alone inane) that some fans prefer his most generic rock n' roll records rather than these more original ones, but if you enjoy the bluesier side of Johnny Winter's talents, this is for you.<BR>4 1/2 stars.
055357342X|5.0|I just finished \\"A Storm of Swords\\" and was impressed.  This is the first book that absolutely pissed me off in terms of what the author was doing and yet kept me reading all the same.  Bad things happen and Martin sure doesn't mind letting it happen to good characters.  <BR>Martin has an excellent writing style and his vision of his world and the plot he has created is amazing.  While I won't go into any Tolkien comparisons, I will say this is the best series I have read in years.  <BR>It does not follow the standard fantasy plot that find in most books.  What it does is create a history that is actually realistic and shows the good and bad in life with ALL his characters.  There are no \\"undefeatable\\" characters.  And don't get close to any of them either cause Martin has no problem killing them off if it furthers his story.  <BR>I couldn't put this book down.  It was amazing and I can't wait for the next book.  I just hate the fact that there is a 2 year time span between each book.
B000002G1Y|3.0|The critics weren't too impressed when John Hiatt released \\"Perfectly Good Guitar\\" back in 1993.   And it is true that the album is somewhat inconsistent, with some song which don't really hold up over time. And the band isn't The Goners, either, and they don't quite lay down the groove that Sonny Landreth & Co. do on albums like \\"Slow Turning\\", \\"The Tiki Bar Is Open\\", and \\"Beneath This Gruff Exterior\\".    But \\"PGG\\" does feature a handful of songs from Hiatt's top shelf, like \\"Straight Outta Time\\", the wry title track, the ballad \\"Blue Telescope\\", and the superb, folkish \\"Buffalo River Home\\".  Again, there are too many unfocused second-rate song to chew your way through here, and the band is disappointing when you've just listened to one of Hiatt's albums with the Goners. But unless you already have them on one of his various compilation albums, it is worth buying \\"Perfectly Good Guitar\\" just for \\"Buffalo River Home\\" and the title track. And if you're lucky like me, your pressing will also contain a 13th track, the slow rock lament \\"I'll Never Get Over You\\", which was re-recorded a decade later in a harder-rocking version for inclusion on the album \\"Beneath This Gruff Exterior\\".   Lucky, or possibly just a European. Anyway, 3 1/2 stars for this one.
0425170349|3.0|This reads more like a screenplay than a novel. The book opens up with a James Bond-type scene, where the main heroes are established by defusing a hijacking that has no bearing on the rest of the book. Clark seems to have developed telepathy, as he figured out that the pilot was ex-USAF instead of ex-USN just by the expression in his eyes. Yeah, right, it felt like Clancy was just trying to atone for dissing the USAF in all his other novels.<br />The plot develops just like a movie. The Rainbow team is established and trains for a while. Then they get called to respond to some terrorist situations. Three, if I recall, and no good guys went down. Everybody's happy. So at this point, we should expect their next mission to go all wrong. And sure enough, it does. What a surprise. Then on the climactic mission, the bad guys seem to have the upper hand until our intrepid heroes summon their Rocky-like strength and defeat the bad guys. Movie over. Whoops, I mean &quot;book over.&quot;<br />I expect this book to be adapted for the big screen, since Clancy clearly wrote it like a typical movie where nothing surprises you. Having said all this, it's filled with the usual Clancy goodies, which makes it enjoyable. But the Hollywood plotline is so disappointing. Having read all of his novels, I'd say that Rainbow Six is the book that jumped the shark. Clancy is simply becoming a lazy writer.
B00005MM01|5.0|This is a gem.  It's childlike innocence conceals remarkable songwriting, musicianship, and poetry.  The equal of Dylan's Blonde on Blonde if in a different, more gentle, vein. It is Romantic in the sense of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Keats, and Shelly.  A classic to be taken seriously.
B0000041Q3|5.0|So you can see that Turandot stands alone as a monument to the great art of three of the most beloved and talented opera singers to ever grace the stages of the Met, La Scala, Paris Opera comique and the Chicago Opera House as well as the great memorial opera house of San Francisco. The buzz is over the sensation of the operatic world. Who else? La Stupenda, the Queen of opera.<BR>But she is not the bottom line. Pavarotti and Caballe are every bit her equal. They match her note for high note and verimos singer of infinite dimensions. Sutherland's huge voice is warm, not cold and boring like Nilsson. who by the way, is the best Wagnerian diva of the century, but her Turandot, pure boredom. Puccini wants an Italian warm voice to sing the many moods of his confused Turandot. NO one, no one, is even close. And you can ignore the one star reviews of this Sutherland tour de force. How dare you give a one star to La Stupenda? a four star is pushing it. Obvious jealousy!!! Nilsson is the only competition. But in my opinions, her so called \\"hydrogen bomb\\" of voice is just that, a blast of ear piercing noise that is best for Wagner, but all wrong for Puccini. As a Brunhilde in Wagner, Nilsson reigns supreme, but as Turandot she is horrible, as the noisy Turandot. Sutherland's \\"voice of the Century\\" and the high C's that come the chest not the head, will blow your head off. She has not only the gorgeous voice, but the power and the easy high notes. She is the only Turandot who does not scream and <BR>stays on pitch.<BR>Now  for her great Calaf and Caballe. easily her equal and a challenge for the \\"voice of the Century\\".  But they love Sutherland, and don't even try. Caballe can try, but she doen not, she loves Sutherland and ask her for advice to sing Norma, which I have to admit Caballe and Callas is  as great as La Stupenda. The deciding force is the greatest mezzo since Malibran, you know her, Marilyn Horne. Along with Horne, Sutherland sets a new and unbeatable force in the art of bel canto singing. Singing that Bellini would have been proud of. Sorry for the deversion, but this Turandot is what legends are made of. And who is your favorite singer? Sutherland? Pavarotti,<BR>Caballe? They're all here, along with Mehta and the knockout audiophile sounds that puts all other Turandots to shame.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book! It is refreshing to find a best-selling author who can actually write well. The plot is intriguing and the characters believeable. Even though I was quite familiar with the theories presented, the author managed to make it all seem fresh, new, and exciting. I could not put this book down. It even inspired me to buy everthing else than Dan Brown has written and I have been favorably impressed with all of his other books. It seems that I have a new favorite author!
B00005JM09|2.0|yesterday finally I had the time to go and watch this movie. I had to wait for many years for this moment, though last year when I read that the father of the Terminator was not going to direct the movie made me very sad. <BR>the movie's opening is boring. I certainley missed the way T2 opens with that great Terminator opening score. I misses all those fires and flames we saw in T2. Arnold is as good as he has always been.<BR>The new John Conner was a complete disaster. This guy looks too soft for being John Conner. As soon as he starts talking we get the feeling of what might come next. <BR>I am talking about too many digitalized scenes that were made without any touch of sense. The movie is also very short. It takes 132 minutes to watch T2 but T3 is about 100 minutes which is a lot shorter. <BR>Arnie, why did have to make T3 when you knew James Cameron was not going to direct this movie? Dear James Cameron, how could you not make T3? I was an huge fan of Terminator, but now after watching this movie I am very disappointed. I will not even buy T3 on DVD, though I have 3 different editions of T2 on DVD.
014028009X|3.0|I did enjoy reading &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot;, it was a funny, witty &amp; a fun reading experience. It did realistically &amp; originally portray dating through a woman's perspective. I also found it to be repetitive, she covered the same subjects again and again. Also, Bridget's obsession with weight was just annoying, annoying enough that I wanted to skip any paragraphs that described weight issues--even though there really was no reason for it to be an issue. In addition, some parts were really boring &amp; pointless, for example, Bridget spent half of a page describing how her fingernails were messy, &amp; that she needed an emery board. She was a character that you loved &amp; hated. She was witty &amp; fun, but at the same time, she acted stupidly around men, and drank and smoked all the time.Plus, it was very dumb when she complained about smoker's rights.This is a light, fluffy, summer reading novel--don't expect anything more. But, overall, this was a novel that I hoped I would love, and tried to love, but in the end, it was just mediocre to me.
B00005JLXE|4.0|While I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, there seems to be a few things missing from the DVD. I remembered seeing a few scenes in the theater that didn't appear on the DVD. This, along with a lack of any deleted scenes, are kind of disappointing, but overall this is a great superhero film. Now we can all watch this until Daredevil 1.5 arrives... :)
0385504209|5.0|What we know about certain things like the Holy Grail may not be what it is. Although some may think that the novel of Dan Brown could affect the Catholic belief, it is not that bad to be open to things that could really be mind liberating for us.  The genesis of the novel is as meaty and exciting as the end. A great salute for a great book.
0553277472|2.0|I managed to get the whole way through on my second attempt at this odd book - hard core philosophical discussion mixed in with the narrator recalling his past life as an insane philosophy-seeker mixed with the story of a road trip. <br />The philosophy is so involved that it is esoteric and actually usually boring rather than mind expanding. And there is very little Zen!! It is hard to feel for the central character - he seems so interesting until he starts becoming so invovled in mind numbing minutiae. But there are some great sections on the riding and the 'art' that can be found in 'non-art' activities like motorcycle maintenance.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am -really- picky about music, and when I heard &quot;Bring me to life&quot; on the radio, I thought it was very good, but I had no idea the rest of the album would be just as good, if not better.  Amy's vocals, and moving lyrics, are as distinctive as Amiee Mann's were back in 1985 with 'til Tuesday.  I am really taken with this band, and find their CD constantly interesting.  I hope their second offering is as good.  Bottom line is BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00006LPER|5.0|Huppert's performance in this movie left me staggering out of the theater and determined to see the film at my own pace so I bought the DVD.  The movie is a testament to Huppert's versatility.  The movie goes far beyond any American movie in its character's relvelations of her lonely and suppressed nature.  I cannot imagine any other actress putting herself through the scenes that Huppert, a consumate actress, played with incredible skill.  It deserves all the awards it won at the Cannes Film Festival.
0385486804|5.0|This is the best book I Have ever read.  Number #1
B000001ESF|5.0|Still one of the best rock albums ever, in my book.  A true masterpiece!  Excellent musicianship!  And I love the story line!  Geddy's awesome shrill when using &quot;the VOICE&quot; is electric!
0385504209|1.0|This book is better than Angels and Demons, but still a highly flawed work.  The Da Vinci Code suffers from heavy handed foreshadowing, contrived conveniences, cardboard characters, bad pacing and (again--just like in Angels and Demons) incorrect facts which skew history, ignore the laws of physics, and force the reader to suspend disbelief past the point of acceptability.<br />Most scary (and the reason for 1 star rather than 2 or 3) are the large numbers of readers who believe EVERY word that Dan Brown writes and quote the book like it's a non-fiction work.  Read it if you must, but remember that it's fiction....
B00008X5J3|4.0|Chicago is such a great show...the cynicism seems so much like that of our age that it's hard to believe that it is based on a 1975 musical, which is based on a 1920's play, which is in turn based on REALITY.  (The playwright was a former newspaper reporter, who turned her experiences covering sensational murder trials into a hit play back in the 20's.)<br />That the plot seems so very up-to-date 80 years after it was originally penned I think goes to the fact that the musical truly captures a part (and just a part) of human nature and portrays it with such gleeful abandon that you can't help but join in the fun.<br />By the way, they cut one of the best songs in the play (\\"Class\\"), which I assume will end up in the DVD, since I read that it was filmed.  Also, the movie version of Cellblock Tango doesn't even hold a CANDLE to the stage version.  But still, a great revival of the movie musical!
B000068GA4|5.0|I am currently awaiting the arrival of this album but owned in the past and this album rocks!!!!  I love Devil's Plaything, 777, Long Way Back From Hell, Snakes of Christ, and Tired of Being Alive.  This album is awesome
B00005JLXE|4.0|Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock?  Yeah, right.  I laughed uncontrollably when I found out he was <BR>going to play the Man Without Fear.  Well, I stopped laughing after watching the film.  He proved me <BR>and countless others wrong.  Every part in this movie was played to perfection.  The story<BR>could have been more true to the comic (where was Stick?, Kingpin is white), but every comic to movie so far<BR>has failed to include everything.  This movie had some great special effects to give you<BR>a feel for Daredevil's blindness and his heightened senses.  All in all, fan or not, this is<BR>a great movie that everybody will enjoy!  ****For you comic fans, look for cameos by Stan<BR>Lee and Kevin Smith****
B00004TDRD|5.0|I purchased the Jaws video for my husband as a Father's Day present.  He absolutely loved it!!  He has seen the movie probably about 100 times, but just can't get enough of it.  Now he can watch it whenever he wants.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is a musical genius and this album definately proves it.  From the funky beats to his soulfull singing, Gavin will undoubtedly make you want to get up and jam.  He has one of the best voices in the business and is very talented on the guitar and piano.  If you don't get this album you will miss out big time.  Gavin is going to be the next big artist, no doubt about it. And if you like the album, you will love him live in concert.  So check it out!
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing.  The beautiful 22 piece orchestra in the background of the majority of songs is amazing.  The lyrics are a bit dark and surreal.  But Amy Lee and Ben Moody are amazing songwriters.  They have an amazing ability to relay a variety of emotions: pain, depression, heartache, etc.  in a graceful and seductive manner.  A combination of the band &quot;You're Pretty&quot; and Mozart's Requiem is what Evanescence whips out.  The hard guitar riffs complimented by Amy's voice is an ideal mixture.  I highly recommend this group.  And if you can check out their earlier album, Origin.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|moulin rouge kick started the musical back into being, and i am very glad that it did.  if not for moulin rouge there may not have been as good of a chance for chicago to make it.  moulin rouge showed people that the musical can still be a quality movie and still have what it takes to be considered, for instance, academy award material.  at the heart of this film is the doomed love story between nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor.  both of these performers carry this movie so well and ewan should have received an academy award nomination right along with nicole.  who knew that the two of them had such good voices?  there is also the musical aspect of the move.  you cannot have a good musical without killer songs.  i have to be honest i got a chill the first time the screen went into the moulin rouge and you were introduced to the patrons of the club.  the song lady marmalade and smells like teen spirit fit perfectly into this situation.  by the way the lady marmalade song released on the radio was one of the best songs of the year.  i listened to it over and over again, and still do.  the other songs are awesome too.  i like the mix of songs put together while they are on top of the elephant.  all those classic songs joined to gether perfectly and nicole and ewan's voices blended so well together.  the song of this movie help explain the tone throughout the movie.  if there is a happy moment in the movie the songs will be upbeat.  if you see love on the screen you here a love song.  and when there is heartache in a scene the actors sing about and the songs work so well.  i am focusing on the music because that is the main part of a musical.  i am not trying to disregard the acting because it is equally as good.  i love this movie and i think it is fantastic.  if you can still find the double disc get it because i dont think there are many left.  rediscover what made musicals so great in the past and embrace what they are becoming now.  these types of movies are what can cause you to have a really good time while watching a movie.  if you dont like this movie then you dont know good cinema.
0812550706|5.0|Having been assigned Ender's Game as one of many titles to choose from on a school reading list, I was prepared for a boring, traditional science fiction novel-- similar to the one's that my father always suggested when I was looking for a &quot;good read.&quot;  However, I was taken aback quickly by the sheer brilliance, intelliect, depth and most importantly originality that Orson Scott Card displayed even early in this novel.<br />I read the book in two sittings; the break was only due to my need to eat food.  I was completely absorbed in the world of Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin.  The futuristic society described in book was so hauntingly possible in the future; the issues facing the world were creepily accurate to those our world is currently facing.  All the aspects of the book were developed to create a completely believable (yet still very science fiction-y) world in which to base the story of a young boy growing up, faced with a burden to save his planet.<br />I refer to this book probably more frequently than any other book that I have read save maybe The Bible.  <br />May I also suggest heavily to read Ender's Shadow- a parallel novel to Ender's Game, which instead follows the life of Bean.  The crossings between the books are brilliant, and I would suggest that you read E-Game before E-Shadow.<br />Anyway you boil down to it, Ender's Game was a fantastically written book that is sure to interest children and adults alike.  Please enjoy...
B000060MMI|3.0|When I first listened to the most excellent &quot;Drunken Lullabys&quot; album I thought, &quot;this is good. very clear Dave King has listened to Shane Macgowan &lt;i&gt; alot &lt;/i&gt;<BR>Flogging Molly is an excellent band. Their music is energetic, animate and interesting. The vocals are empassioned and beautifully sung, the same can be said for the instrumentals. Flogging Molly lacks just one thing- originality.<br />The Pouges have done all of Flogging Molly's CDs before Flogging Molly was even an idea. Pick up a copy of The Pouge's &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; or &quot;Rum, Sodomy and The Lash&quot; and listen. a very obvious example, &quot;Turkish Song Of The Damned&quot; = &quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot;. <br />If you like Flogging Molly you'll love the Pouges, as the sequel can't beat the original (just look at what's happened to Starwars and that damned Planet of the Apes remake).
6305558167|5.0|I am not an Arthurian legend stickler and I have no qualms about the details of the film. 'Excalibur' is pure entertainment. It is an epic: the acting, plot, scenery, musical score and moral themes blend together seamlessly. Simply a thoroughly and completely fantastic movie; indeed in the genre of fantasy I have seen no equal (that includes the LoTR). This Wagnerian masterpiece is definitely one for the collection.
B000089RVX|4.0|Very well organized.  Amy Lee has an incredible voice, which enhances the driving music.  \\"Bring me to Life\\" is the first single off this CD, with a video on MTV.com, featuring Paul McCoy of 12 Stone, and has incredible lyrics and music.  The CD is packed with haunting tunes, and just great rock tunes.  Great for driving!
B000046PVN|5.0|John Williams' Superman score has such range and variety. It's his best score ever, and that's saying a lot considering he's behind almost every great epic magical blockbuster movie. Highly recommended CD.<br />By the way, the guy who wrote the Amazon.com editorial on this obviously hasn't seen the movie in a while. It's far from cartoonish, and is only dated in the clothing that the extras wear. Superman: The Movie is definitely my favorite movie ever, and John Williams' score makes it even more memorable and magical.
B00005JLTN|5.0|the one explained <BR>\\"the one\\" is a program, but has to be \\"attached\\" to someone in the matrix. so mr. anderson got it in the 6th version of the matrix. then \\"the one\\" program's purpose is to allow zion to be destroyed then to rebuild it. the reason for this is because of anomalies - the 1% of humans that don't accept the matrix. these are all brought out of the matrix program and into the zion program by the \\"morpheus\\" program and other <BR>similar \\"ship captain\\" programs. then once all the anomalies are out of the matrix (and in zion), that is the time for zion to be destroyed, thus killing all the anomalies off. the matrix is then upgraded, thus creating the next version of the <BR>matrix, but zion must be rebuilt so that the next lot of anomalies can be brought out again so that they can be destroyed. this is the feedback-loop, and is the reason to retain a handful of people so that zion can be rebuilt. so this is why neo said the prophecy was a lie - the one's purpose was not to end the war as the prophecy stated. unfortunately, \\"the one\\" program must be re-used each time, or copied, so it can be \\"attached\\" to a new anomaly inside the matrix. so what happens to the old \\"the one\\" program? it faces deletion, and as the oracle explained, it goes into exile instead, just like the french bloke (the merovingian) did. he was the first one (probably from the second version of the matrix), and once he fulfilled his duty, he became an exile program and \\"abdicated\\" his \\"oneness\\" by choosing persephone and power. this is evident in the bogs when persephone asks neo to kiss her. she says she wants <BR>him to kiss her so she can feel what it is like again to be kissed by something close to human, just like the merovingian used to be. then she says to trinity that she <BR>envies her, but that these things are not meant to last. so the merovingian used to be just like neo - a one - thus proving further the feedback-loop explained earlier.
B000089RVX|5.0|So far this is my favorite cd. It is the best.
B000000OSG|5.0|Just like any other Guns N' Roses album, it's a classic, a must buy and an album that anyone who knows abouyt hard rock or heavy music must own and review.<br />This is Guns N' Roses making art and showing off as musicians, yeah it's not as hard and raw as Appetite, but it still  kicks @ss!<br />Highlights: Kncocking on Heaven's Door, Civil War
B000002UJQ|5.0|I must admit that as recently as year ago I would have been one of those people who would have complained endlessly about how over-rated Radiohead was. But then one day something magical happened, I actually listened to them, and I was utterly disgusted with myself for my ignorance. RADIOHEAD DESERVE EVERY BIT OF CREDIT THEY GET. Ok Computer is probably not their most accessible album but it may very well be their best and well worth ANY attempt you must make to realize this (buying every other Radiohead album just to get familiar with the band would NOT be too much). <br />Although I would be the first to say that this is not an album to be listened to for any one song, anyone who doubts the musical brilliance that is Thom Yorke and Radiohead need only to listen to the song &quot;Karma Police&quot;,  quite possibly the best song I've heard since this album was released.
0385504209|5.0|Admittedly I have &quot;read&quot; the audio version and found it to have clearly devliered on the best reviews already written.  A+
B00005JLSE|5.0|Ok...Chicago is about murder,greed,violence,adultery,fame,and treachery. The plot is simple, two women murder thier lovers and get away with it. But it is so much more than that. Moulin Rouge, despite having no original songs, was barely a musical. Sure there were songs, but very little dancing. Nicole Kidman is a good singer but lets face it Catherine Zeta Jones can really belt it out. Renee Zellweger(love her)also has a lovely voice, it wasn't the greatest but you must remember that she has never done anything like this before. Her voice was actually perfect for the role. Roxie is supposed to be the junior singer, the one who has less experience. The music is great too! It was all written by Kander and Ebb(also wrote music for Cabaret,Kiss of The Spider Women, Steel Pier, The Act, Zorba, etc.) Bob Fosse wanted to make Chicago into a movie for a while before he passed away. In the movie there are a lot of cases were it reverts back to Chicago the musical(the original Bob Fosse musical not the revival). Velma rising from the floor at the beginning of All That Jazz, Roxie on the piano in Funny Honey, the cell bars in Cell Block Tango, the stipping of Billy in All I Care About, Roxie's name in lights in ROXIE, Mama Morton's fan in When Your Good to Mama, etc. Moulin Rouge had fancy sets and all that glam, but even with just a black stage Chicago do so much better. Chicago was ment for stage, Moulin Rouge wasn't. Sorry folks, but Chicago is the real winner and the real musical here.
B000089RVX|5.0|For all of you who have been looking for a genuinly good rock cd, this is the one! Finally, a band has come out from the underground that is hard rock with a twist. And their whole cd is good, not just one or two songs! &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is the best track on the cd, but not far behind it is &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; and &quot;My Last Breath&quot;. &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; are the moving ballads on the cd and are good as well. This cd all in all is the best buy of the year.
B00004U2G1|3.0|Don't get me wrong: I think this is one of the best albums of the mid 1970's. I own it on vinyl and CD -- but the SACD is disappointing. For one thing, it's a two channel mix. Not that stereo SACD's are a bad thing per se, but given the other excellent 5.1 mixes of albums of the same era (for example, &quot;Hotel California&quot; on DVD-Audio and &quot;The Stranger&quot; on SACD) this disc falls short. Imagine the Boston guitar lines swooping in from your surround speakers. It's not happening here. <br />More than that, for me the disc didn't add much in clarity or impact compared to the original. The soundstage has more depth which serves to isolate the vocals a bit, but there are very few &quot;aha!&quot; moments. The quiet passages are the ones that shine -- for example the intro to &quot;Foreplay&quot;. Perhaps this is all a result of the original mix, which lacked subtlety in favor of a &quot;wall of sound&quot; approach. I recommend the disc only for diehard Boston fans.
B000089RVX|5.0|here is a band that has a new sound that I've never heard before. It is a sound that mixes rock with darker chords for a somewhat gothic sound. This band rocks my face off and I am going to an upcoming concert to see if they rock in person as well. I highly recomend them!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|What a hilarious, goofy, warm-hearted film!  It passed the JOY test--my two-year old kept asking to see it again (even when her favorite Caillou was on--sorry PBS).  Commercialism, the energy crisis, jobs vs. ethics, employee incentive programs (yes this one even encouraged team work) that turn employees against each other--all the big adult issues are plowed through in a manner that tells us the kids are right--stop screaming--go out and play instead.<br />Joy triumphs over fear in the end, and good characters win, bad characters lose, and cunning characters get their just rewards.  Monsters Inc. is a joyful film that will leave thoughtful viewers contemplating the monsters in their own lives, and that perhaps we approach it all in a very backwards manner.<br />The acting and animation were superb.  This is great stuff!  Buy it...rent it...enjoy it again and again!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is incredible.  Evanescence isn't a typical Wind Up records band- they have their own sound.  And that sound is great.  The vocals are great, and so is the music.  I tend to find myself getting lost in the music (this is a good thing).  And trust me- this is one CD you'll never get sick of.
0743224345|5.0|This is a great book for prep on hard questions. It has a good selection of questions and great strategies - goes beyond the basic stuff other books talk about. I do think this book offers something the others don't, and has a very realistic set of questions - I found some other books didn't quite hit the mark in terms of offering GMAT style questions. I would recommend this for anyone shooting for a 720+. Look at this book after you have prepped a little with the more basic materials. I got a 770 and I think this book helped.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Imagine a darker Abba with monster guitars, techno driving drums and you might get close to what Tatu sound like. Yes, they're gorgeous (and they've never said they were lesbians, they said they were bi - very big difference but WHO CARES!) As to the criticism that they don't write their songs, don't play instruments (not true, both are classically trained) and don't produce themselves, well, there goes Elvis, I guess. Rock acts, especially pop acts, are a combination of the act itself, their producers and their marketing people. ALL rock acts. I wasn't interested until I saw them on a British TV show and a late night US show, both times playing live, and they knocked me on my rear end, very strong, tight, heavy band. &quot;All The Things You Said,&quot; &quot;Show Me Love&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; are absolutely KILLER tracks, play them loud and you'll hear classic Europop that rocks very, very hard. Great stuff. Sure they're packaged and promoted. SO WERE NIRVANA. That's rock and roll, y'all, and Tatu rock like crazy.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Let's get one thing straight...this is not a serious film.  Legally Blonde doesn't take itself seriously, which is how I like my comedies.  The storyline is a stereotypical California blonde gets her heart broken.  Elle Woods is the president of her sorority and leads a charmed life.  She has a 4.0 in Fashion Merchandising and thinks her hunk of a boyfriend, Warner, is going to propose.  However, he breaks up with her to pursue Harvard Law School and to \\"get serious.\\"  Elle is momentarily in the dumps (over seeing her dreams snatched away so suddenly) but like any truly worthwhile heroine, she pulls herself up by her bootstraps and moves on and into overdrive.  Elle's hard work is rewarded by passing the LSAT and miraculously getting into Harvard Law School.<br />Elle arrives with flair to the campus and soon discovers the world outside of LA is different.  Elle runs into the ex-boyfriend on her way to her first class and makes a meeting time to \\"catch up\\" after class.  She arrives to class but wasn't prepared so she was asked to leave her first class by professor Stromwell.  While lamenting on a park bench, she meets Emmett Richmond (more on him later).  Warren meets up with Elle and Elle is getting her groove back when all of a sudden Warren introduces her to Vivian, his fiancée.  <br />With nothing going her way (no one wants to let her join their study group, she gets invited to a party by Vivian and just needs a good manicure).  Elle meets Paulette, played terrifically by Jennifer Coolidge, at the beauty salon and who is just surviving and not really living.  Elle and Paulette quickly become friends and by having regular manicures, Elle gets into the swing of things at Harvard.  She starts to put her mind to the task at hand and basically does it on her own.  Elle is starting to impress her professors and is asked to apply for a coveted position in Professor Callahan's law office.  They are representing Brooke Taylor Windham, a famous trainer along the lines of Kathy Smith.  Brooke is accused of the murder of her husband.  Brooke refuses to reveal her alibi even if it means going to prison for life.  Professor Callahan assembles a group of first year law students to be supervised by Emmett Richmond.  He is a member of Callahan's law practice and taken with Elle.  They work together on the case.  Also in the group of students are Warren and Vivian, which adds some needed drama.  Elle goes to pay Brooke a visit and discovers her \\"secret.\\"  There is a big courtroom climax and all's well (or Elle) that ends well (again Elle).   <br />The beauty of this film is not in the story.  This storyline is all formula.  The acting and casting are what make this film work so well.  Reese Witherspoon plays Elle just exaggerated enough to make her larger than life but restrained enough to not make her cartoon-ish.  Other worthy performances are Victor Garber as Professor Callahan.  He is convincing as a slimy lawyer.  Ali Larter as Brooke is a good match for Reese's Elle.  They are both former presidents of Delta Nu at CULA and they have the same mentality.  Selma Blair doesn't play Vivian Kensington with a malicious angle.  She pretty much treats Elle like most fiancées would when confronted with someone chasing their fiancé.  Jennifer Coolidge gives us the best performance of the bunch.  Ditzy but loveable Paulette is who you root for and has a heart of gold.  I was disappointed with Luke Wilson's character, Emmett Richmond.  I would have liked to have seen him guide the group more during the discovery phase.  It was almost like he was a student team member instead of a lawyer himself.  <br />Elle Woods is a character that is not bound by what those around her think.  She is a force of her own and brings others around to reality.  This is a fun movie with lots of snappy dialogue and great characters.
B00008AWOD|5.0|Wow!...What an album!.<BR>After all that androgin, glitter-punk rock begining, this got to be the most mature, finest album this english trio has ever made, i mean, Black Market was close, but this is , by far my favorite Placebo Album.<BR>Ok, you wanna best album songs, dont you?...forget it! listen the whole cd and check by yourself the deep lyrics and the   balanced sound of the band: Brians guitar rocks as good as in early times did, drums are pretty good mixed with rhytm machines which, by the way, doesnt suck at all as in some electro-industrial rock crossover bands' albums, bass is simple, straight and smooth. And if you enjoy Brian Molkos provocative nasal voice,you are gonna ask for more.<BR>Maybe Black Market was better accepted than Without You Im Nothing because its mature songs, but believe me, this one sounds like coming from better songwriter musicians. <BR>I dont wanna be pretentious but Sleeping With Ghosts could mean for the band what Songs Of Faith And Devotion meant for Depeche Mode: their highest and finest moment.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|I hate this alternative rock poseur punk band! They stink. No talent. Just whiney and they have one of the worst singers of all time! AVOID! Get real punk like The Exploited, The Casualties, and The Unseen.
B00005RFVL|5.0|It sounds incredulous when I first learned Rob was making a Jazz album. When it came out, I rushed to the record store and got one copy out of curiosity. It sounds a bit strange in the first place, but I gradually became addicted to it.<br />Since Rob used to be in the boy band Take That, I couldn¡¦t imagine Rob had received training from Jazz and classical music. The songs he interpreted on the album were those he listened to and loved in his childhood. His voice sounds incredibly casual and slick on every track in contrast to the usual madness in it. Being a Robbie fan, the album is a must-have. No matter you like Jazz or not, it¡¦s a pure enjoyment just listening to Rob singing.<br />Here I rate every track on the album:<BR>1. I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen- Rob and Guy Chambers did an excellent job imitating songs out of musicals. The lyrics are funny and wicked. (9/10)<BR>2. Mack the Knife- Not a very compelling track, but the way Rob sings makes it brilliant. (8/10)<BR>3. Something Stupid- Some reviews highly appreciate Nicole Kidman¡¦s part on it. But in my opinion, Rob¡¦s voice has covered Nicole¡¦s all through the song. I can¡¦t believe Rob can be so gentle when singing. Great song! (10/10)<BR>4. Do Nothing till You Hear from Me- Another great Jazz, the music playing is great. (7/10)<BR>5. It Was a Very Good Year- Pretty sad. Rob only did the seventeen and twenty-one parts; the rest was performed by Frank Sinatra. (8/10)<BR>6. Straight up and Fly Right- Not very impressive. Just listen to Rob, then. (6/10)<BR>7. Well Did You Evah- The track also has the musical style. The music playing and background vocals sound great. (7/10)<BR>8. Mr. Bojangles- Another best of the album. You¡¦ll be profoundly entertained by Rob when he whistles, sing with two different kinds of voices and talk. Very formidable track! (10/10)<BR>9. One for My Baby (and One for the Road)- I don¡¦t love that song, but all music reviews say it¡¦s great. The song itself is already classic, but it doesn¡¦t show Rob¡¦s great singing ability. (6/10)<BR>10. Things- Very casual and sweet. Rob and Jane¡¦s flirtations are fun! (9/10)<BR>11. Ain¡¦t That a Kick in the Head- The song is just fine and Rob sounds good as usual. The way the song ends makes it special. (8/10)<BR>12. They Can¡¦t Take That Away from Me- Rob did a great job as he sounded even better than Rod Stuart singing that song. But the track doesn¡¦t stand out on the album. (8/10)<BR>13. Have You Met Miss Jones- The songs gets better and better from the beginning to the end. I was rejoiced finding its appearance on the movie ¡§Bridget Jones¡¦ Diary.¡¨ (9/10)<BR>14. Me and My Shadow- Another favorite song of mine on the album. Rob and Jonathan make a wonderful duet, and the short pause amid the song is outstanding. Rob sounds best on it! (10/10)<BR>15. Beyond the Sea- The climax of the album. Though the song itself is slow, but again, Rob makes it amazing. I knew the song will become hot as Disney chose it to be its new movie theme. (9/10)
B00005JL78|5.0|...Anyway now ... I'll start telling why this movie rules! Set in the chillingly possible future of 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is arguably the most intelligently provocative sci-fi thriller since Blade Runner. Spielberg's gritty vision was freely adapted from a story by Philip K. Dick, with its central premise of \\"Precrime\\" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human \\"precogs\\" capable of envisioning murders before they're committed. As Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. Inspired by the brainstorming of expert futurists, Spielberg packs this paranoid chase with potential conspirators domestic tragedy, and a heartbreaking precog pawn, while Cruise's performance gains depth and substance with each passing scene. This is a movie not to pass up. See it today. THUMBS WAY UP!!!
B00008MNYS|5.0|I¡¦ve been anticipating ¡§Escapology¡¨ when learning of its releasing date. Rob didn¡¦t disappoint me at all. In fact, the album has become one of my favorite CDs in 2002. Get one copy; it really worth the price!<br />I think ¡§Escapology¡¨ is a transitional work from Rob with its mixture of music style. ¡§Feel,¡¨ the first single, is another song of his former style. The others are totally of different kinds. Under the influence of his previous album ¡§Swing When You¡¦re Winning,¡¨ ¡§Revolution, ¡§Handsome Man, and ¡§Me and My Monkey¡¨ sound just like Jazz. Rob did the most excellent vocal work in ¡§Revolution,¡¨ duet with Rose Stone. Rob tells a peculiar story in ¡§Me and My Monkey,¡¨ the longest song Rob¡¦s ever written so far, portrays the dilemma between his ego and evil spirit. The song is widely recognized.<br />The other songs are no less brilliant; actually, I can never get enough of telling how good they are. The CD stayed in my player for over a week. I have to say that Rob¡¦s writing improved both musically and lyrically. I just don¡¦t understand why the album is not popular in the U.S. Too bad that the song ¡§Cursed¡¨ is not included in the U.S. version of ¡§Escapology.¡¨ It¡¦s the most outstanding Rock song written by Rob. Although Geri Halliwell, the girl Rob talks about in it, is not known in the States, it doesn¡¦t harm its cleverness at all.    <br />Rob emphasized that his voice wasn¡¦t adorned in the tracks, but it still sounds wonderful. One thing that displeases me is that the EMI isn¡¦t very good at choosing singles. ¡§Feel¡¨ and ¡§Come undone¡¨ didn¡¦t become #1s, but it doesn¡¦t matter at all as the album is likely to become Rob¡¦s best-selling album.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|They're back. And we should be glad. Given the junk some bands are putting out today, this is a good boost to the music industry as a whole.  <br />Alot of these songs are a taste of the old Fleetwood Mac.  Neat guitar licks and wonderful folk harmonies overtop a strong and full-sounding balanced rhythm section.  It's the very entertaining stuff we have come to know over the years from them.  Even without McVie, the music is still passionate, thought provoking and well written in idea and message. <br />There are even two songs that somewhat classify as &quot;different direction&quot; in nature - Murrow Turning Over and Come.  Both are very good songs but extremely against the grain. &quot;Come&quot; has a feel of psychodalia where Murrow is a bouncy, off-beat, different attitude type of sound.  I caught myself thinking that maybe the talented songwriter Sheryl Crow had some input there.  And that's a good thing.  <br />The best songs are obviously Peacekeeper and Say You Will, but my personal fave is Smile at You, which sounds perfect for Stevie's vocal style. Also -- it's just a darn good tune. <br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because even though most of the music is great, there are 3 or 4 songs near the end that seem to be fillers. <br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.  It's truly another fine piece of work from some very talented, legendary artists.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I am a Madonna fan. This was not my favorite of her albums but it's very good. Worth buying!!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I love this movie alot and I can't see how anyone could hate it! The actors are great and so is the story and the music! Also I dont understand why people are making such a big deal about its topic. I mean get over yourselves, Chicago isnt the only movie with the same type of topic! The previews made it pretty clear that these women are in jail and if it was that big of a problem for you then why did you go to see it???  This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. People under 12 or 13 probably shouldnt see it. I personally think that Catherine Zeta Jones did a better job in Chicago than Renee Zellweger. I did think that Renee did a great job. I think that Catherine and Renee both shouldve been nominated for Best Actress and Catherine totally shouldve won. But Im overjoyed that she won Best Supporting Actress! Every actor in this movie excelled in singing and I personally love this soundtrack! I personally thought that this movie was funny! But maybe I just have a wierd sense of humor since I was one of the few people laughing in the movie theater. I prefer Chicago to Moulin Rouge, but I don't think you can really compare the two. OK, they're both musicals, but Moulin Rouge is a love story, something Chicago definately isn't (!!!) Chicago is \\"harder\\" than Moulin Rouge. I liked both movies but Chicago takes the cake!  Anyways, with that all said, Chicago is a true classic and should be remeber for years and years to come!
B00005Q66T|5.0|I just got this recently and I am really happy with it. My only regret was that I didn't purchase it sooner. It has all the great songs since The Immaculate Collection. It starts with Erotica and ends with Music. Buy it, you will love it!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence rocks!  Amy Lee has one of the most incredible voices out there today, and the richness of their music is like nothing I have ever heard!  When I put Fallen in my CD player, I can't help but listen to it over and over.
B000099T2L|3.0|Overall, I think this album is just O.K.  It definitely is not earth shattering.  The one thing that really bothers me is the \\"Be With You\\" track.  If you lisen closely to the rhythm of the meolody line, it is exactly the same as the song \\"Freak Like Me\\" by Adina Howard (1995) just performed more slowly.<br />I am still happy nonetheless with Beyonce's success, and I hope nothing but the best for her.
B00005JLSE|5.0|it's hard for me to believe that ANYONE with any sense of theater or music would think that \\"moulin rouge\\" is better.  I too thought \\"rouge\\" was a wonderful film.  But to take a musical from the stage (which moulin rouge is not) and tranform it into film is one of the hardest things to do in this business.<BR>And the cast and production team did this amazingly well.  <br />having friends that are in the film might make me a little biased but hearing how great the filming process was for all of them just makes me love the movie even more.<br />get it NOW and enjoy it FOREVER!
B00005JLXE|1.0|JENNIFER GARNER DIES!!!<BR>And there was no character development...the movie was too fast in the storyline....oh wait, there wasn't one...&quot;wam bam, thankyou mam&quot;....enough said.
0913866156|5.0|I have used several different decks in my nearly twenty years of reading. Each deck has it's own merits, and I believe that most of the strength in a reading comes from the reader, and the cards are just a tool the reader is using. There are decks I prefer for certain situations however, and when I want painfully accurate, this deck is the one I reach for. It has an attitude, and has never given me a very positive reading. The Thoth deck is well worth it if you feel a connection with the darker or 'gothy' side of the road.
B0000203YT|5.0|It is easy to see why Shakespeare in Love won so many awards in 1998. The only problem was perhaps that Joseph Fiennes, for the role of William Shakespeare, was largely ignored. Still, this is a film that truly deserves all the accolades that it received, and Gweneth Paltrow was excellent as Viola, the woman that Shakespeare falls in love with. <br />Although purely a fictitious story, there is so much Victorian and Shakespeare flavor to this that gives it its authenticity. This is a movie that is both romantic and humorous. Shakespeare, because of writer's block, goes to seek advice from a counselor about his inability to come up with a script. That is, until he meets Viola De Lesseps (Gweneth Paltrow), who inspires him to writing. <br />One of the great things I noticed upon a second viewing of this was the many allusions to Shakespeare's plays. For instance, a man opposing the theatre is on a platform and yells \\"A plague on both their houses\\" (which is a reference to Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet). Later, Shakespeare, while thinking, mutters the phrase \\"words, words, words\\" a la Hamlet.<br />The plot is cleverly contrived, as they pick through the details of Shakespeare existence and are able to use the story to explain several events of his life. For example, Shakespeare meets and speaks with fellow Victorian writer and rival Christopher Marlowe in a tavern and they discuss their upcoming plays. (Marlowe gives Shakespeare a little advice for Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter...before it was Romeo and Juliet).  We also see the troubles that Shakespeare and playwrights had in keeping playhouses open due to radicals against it and the plague scourge, as well as the injustice that women had in not being able to participate in plays (Viola dresses up like a young boy to play a part). Shakespeare is away from his wife Anne Hathaway and his children because he wants to think about writing. <br />The way it is presented is in the form of the play Romeo and Juliet, so, in a way, it is a play within a movie. But, still, the main feature of the film is telling or basing a tale about Shakespeare's life and time. The fact that it is not an accurate depiction of Shakespeare's life is insignificant. This is an exceptional movie for the Shakespeare aficionado and anyone who wants to see an intelligent romantic comedy.
B00005JLTN|5.0|If you are a fan of the film, as I am, you saw it more than once in theaters. The first time around I was very focused on trying to remember everything so I could piece together the story later. I saw it again and helped to answer some of my own questions, I realized that I \\"missed\\" a few things, plus it was a much more relaxing film experience. My point is that, like the Matrix, there is enough \\"story behind story\\" to make this film fun to watch over and over and over. You will notice new things every time. Reloaded has action like never seen before in a movie but the real enjoyment is the mental exercise that you will get in deciphering all the plot elements and trying to figure out where the story is going and where it's been and how the messages might relate to your own (and OUR own) existence.<br />It seems to me that those who hate the movie just don't enjoy the unanswered questions. Don't expect to be spoon-fed your story. There is no.... well, YOU get the picture.<br />For those unfamiliar with the movie, don't dismiss it as just an action movie. If you ever pondered any of life philosophical questions this will rekindle your interest. (Just make sure to watch The Matrix first. Several times.)<br />Also note that this movie is not conclusive. It ends mid-story with a bit of a cliff hanger. That's not a bad thing since it gives fans time to digest and discuss it. To be concluded with the release of \\"Revolutions\\" in November. Bravo to WB for not making us wait until 2004.<br />Seeing Reloaded twice just wasn't enough. I look forward to the DVD not just for the extras but the ability to watch it again and again.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This collection of Queen CD's is a must for all Queen fans.  The first two CD's are great examples of how fabulous this group is, as well as how many different styles they use. The third CD has many Queen songs sung buy other artists at the Farewell Tribute concert to Freddie Mercury. This collection is great for big Queen fans as well as people just starting to discover them. I recommend these CD's to everyone.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin has come a long way from the young \\"Stevie Winwood\\" teenage keyboard player in the \\"People's Band\\" a great soulful local bar-band from the Monticello New York area. AS NYC music lovers know this guy will be a star. This album is such a break from the weak top-40 junk the record labels have been pushing- Thank god for Clive Davis and J Records for recognizing this great talent. Chariot is full of honest songs all written by Gavin and played with intensity from a great backing band. The production is clean and the variety of heart felt songs really seems to be full of his soul. <br />I hope he will bocome more than just this years John Mayer. I just cannot wait till he gets to tour here in Colorado. Buy this CD!!!
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie was very good. I loved Denzel Washington in this movie, in his other movies he always plays the good guy. But training day has a little bit of comedy, action, adventure and suspense all wrapped up into one. I would recommend this movie to anyone that i know.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I actually believe that Agent Smith and the \\"multiple matrix\\" theories can both hold water. In the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, didn't anybody even notice the \\"multiple galaxies\\" of matrix code (and the cool looking giant gear)? I thought this would be a good enough hint, but apparently not many people feel that this is an important part of the movie. Also, listen closely to The Architect's speech at the end of The Matrix Reloaded. He says that if Neo is to walk through the door leading back to the Matrix, it will \\"result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everything connected to the Matrix.\\" Doesn't anybody else think that he's talking about Smith? Smith takes over people's bodies when he multiplies, so these people die right? After all, Neo himself said it \\"felt like dying.\\" This is what I believe, anyway. However, I hate to disappoint most of you when I tell you that Neo most likely will not bring about the destruction of the Matrix. Why not? Simply because they're coming out with a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (The Matrix Online) next year... and they've even said the game \\"takes place inside the Matrix after the end of The Matrix Revolutions.\\"
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl Soundtrack is the best ever. Composer Klaus Badelt did a very good job. You'll want to listen to it over and over.
B000000993|5.0|I picked this up shortly after I digested (ie. fell in love with) nima.  I can't say enough great things about this band, and I definitely recommend anything you can dig up from them.  As for this work, it is a very &quot;rocking&quot; album.  It is heavy, originial (especially for when it was released), and very intelligent.  Some of their most engenious hooks and riffs can be found on this album.  The bass work is a very dominant and important feature in Tool's music, and this album shocases it at it's best.  The drumming is impressive (astonishing in the later works), the vocals are primal and emotional, and the guitar is some of the most inventive youll find in rock music. I can't say that I prefer any album from Tool over another.  There are times when I have cravings for each one, because Tool never does the same thing twice.  If you miss one of their albums, you will be missing a huge, impressive leap of evolution from this amazing band.
B00006HBUC|1.0|Yikes, what did they do to this classic children's cartoon?  Freddie was the worst, followed by Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Shaggy and Scooby were great, and the computer generation of a 3D Scooby was pretty good.  But the entire story of soul-sucking aliens was really stupid.  And the worse scene of this movie (among many) was the one where Freddie transmigrated his soul into Daphne's body and got lustful thinking he could look at \\"herself\\" naked.  So grotesque.  And what did they do to Scrappy?  I always loved Scrappy and how he would boss Unca Scooby around.  They made Scrappy into a ... creep.  Definitely no good.<br />Bring me the Saturday morning cartoons any day.  The movie was disappointing and not entirely suitable to young children, but more for frat guys.
0783225482|4.0|This movie is pretty goofy and far-fetched. But it's very funny. It's about a woman who goes insane after she loses another man to the same hot-shot broadway star woman. About 14 years later she gets an amazing makeover from a mystical potion and tracks down the woman. But she has taken the potion too. The potion restores youth and beauty and makes their bodies invincable to death. Causing them to live forever. Their violent and deadly cat-fights do no good to enflict pain in each other. This movie contains lots of dark humor, drama, and suspense. It reminds me of \\"She-Devil\\", \\"Fatal Attraction\\", and \\"The War Of The Roses\\". All in one.
B000087DRK|5.0|This was the best rock and roll album of the nineties.  It is an excellent album from a very influential band.  Anyone who doesn't like Turbonegro is poser and should be executed immediately.
0792833201|5.0|I don't know why this movie was rated PG? It was much scarier than that. It's about a house built over indian burial ground. Resulting in a bizarre and terrifying haunting for the family. A force kidnapps their daughter and takes her into the after-life world. The family battles the vengeful spirit's campangue of terror as they try to get their daughter back. Everytime I see a fuzzy TV screen I think of this movie. The clown-doll part was so scary! As well as the utility room scene where he   starts ripping his face off and into the sink. I heard that a lot of terrible things happened to the people who were involved in making this film. Just like \\"The Exorcist\\".
6304698682|5.0|This Clint Eastwood western got little attention in 1985, but it still holds up well today, with Eastwood playing the man with no name mantra, it starts out with many outlaw cowboys terrorizing mountain settlers who they are trying to run off because of possible gold that could be there, we discover that the town's owner wants the mining expedition all to his self &amp; will do anything to acquire it, this is where Eastwood comes in, in which he helps the settlers keep what is theirs, with Michael Moriarty(Law &amp; Order) as the settler's leader &amp; Sydney Penny(T.V.'s All my Children) as his stepdaughter who developes a fixation on Eastwood, we learn he is a priest or so we think who has sort of a mysterious past &amp; not much is known about him, when the town's owner realizes they have outside help, he attempts to bribe him to join his cause, when that fails he then hires a ruthless sherriff &amp; his 6 deputies who uphold whatever law there is to the highest bidder, a sherriff which Eastwood has a past with, but not much is revealed about their past, in which they have a showdown towards the end, this movie has many subplots in it that really work &amp; the look on the shrriff's face when he realizes who he is up against is creepy, I am not sure if Eastwood was trying to make a sequel to &quot;Outlaw of Josey Whales&quot; or what, but it sure plays on that theme as if the sherriff was one he missed in that one, or vice versa, &amp; is better than &quot;Unforgiven&quot; which in some ways could be a sequel to this one, but this one stands out &amp; could be a stand alone movie, it should be noted that Eastwood directed all 3 films, &amp; might have had that intension all along, I used to like &quot;Josey Whales&quot; the best, but this one is the better one I think!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the best new bands I have heard in a long time!!  Amy Lee has an amazing voice, and she is supported by outstanding instrumentals.

B0000041Q3|5.0|The singing is beyond believe. I just don't have the words to describe how beautiful it is. Just trust that this is all the critics and Schwann catalogs's recommendations for the hands down rendition of Puccini's last work. I would rather listen to this recording than a thousand Callas' whatever. The singing is at a level of heaven. Thank God for blessing us with the divine voices of Sutherland, pavarotti, and Caballe. When I'm sad I'll listen to this and lift up my spirits.<BR>A note... the Nilsson Turandots are a disappointment to me. I expected much, and got nothing. I mean no disrespect to the greatest Wagnerian singer of her time. But as Turandot, she is clearly not in the class of Sutherland. Not even close, God bless y'all.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What's not to like about Chicago.  Sundays at Soldier Field, summer afternoons at Wrigley and weekends in Lincoln Park.  Cruising Lake Shore Drive and boating in the Lake.  Brats and sausages.  Riding the El to grandma's house.  The only thing that gives Chicago a bad name is some terrible musical/movie they made named Chicago.
0140157352|4.0|Negotiating is a skill that can be learned. Getting to yes attempts to demistify the difficulties of reaching an agreement by providing simple and effective basis for negotiation. Through the identification of the interests, common to both parties or divergent, one learns how to create options in order to satisfy both parties' needs. The authors also suggest courses of action when confronted with difficult counterparties. <br />My only criticism would relate to the grammatical construction of some of the sentences. It is sometimes difficult to determine what the subject is. This requires the reader to go over the same sentence several times before being able to grasp the ideas set forth.

B00005JLXE|4.0|I rented this movie yesterday when it first came out, and wasn't expecting much but I'd have to say I was impressed.  I'm in the younger generation so I didn't have the comic books like Spiderman, The Hulk, Daredevil or X-Men available to me so I rely on the movies to tell some of the great stories.  Director/Screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson did a wonderful job of that.  He made it clear what had happened to Matt and how he lived his life afterwards.  The action scenes were superb also with great fighting and matrix type slow motion.<br />12 year old Matt Murdock is a kid that gets picked on at school.  His father (David Keith) tells him not to fight because he is going to become a \\"lawyer\\" or a \\"doctor\\" when he's all grown up.  One day he takes a shortcut home from school only to see his father mugging and bullying a guy in the alley.  Devastated from what he's seen Matt runs the other way only into a chemical drop off.  He causes a semi to hit a barrel of chemicals and a spray shoots off into his eyes.<br />He wakes up in a hospital with bandages over his  eyes, and able to hear everything around him, even through the walls.  Obviously his other 4 senses have grown stronger with losing his sight. His dad comes to visit him and says a couple important things, \\"I'm sorry\\" and they made a promise that neither of them would ever give up.  Keeping their promises the father goes back into his old profession, a prizefighter. Even though Matt is blind his other 4 senses create a radar type vision so he can see some things.  He makes a promise to himself that he would live without fear for the rest of his life, and starts practicing martial arts and fighting.  One night his father is visited by a guy named Falon or Vallon before a fight.  He tells him to take a dive in the fight but keeping his promise to Matt he doesnt give up and wins the fight.  Afterwards out in the street the father is beaten up by 2 guys and then killed and a red rose is left on the body.  <br />Years later, when all grown up Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night, being a lawyer helps him pick out his victims for the night.  All he wants is justice.  He sleeps in this coffin type thing with water filled up to his ears, because if he were to sleep on the outside he could hear everything going on outside.  He wakes up and goes over to his shelf and takes a 10 dollar bill out of a box and folds it lengthwise and then pulls out a 5 dollar bill out of another box and folds it the other way, so he can tell which one is which.  He goes to work that day and goes to court to defend a purgery victim.  Matt ask him a question and because of his advanced hearing he can hear his heartbeat and can tell if he's lying by his heartbeat speeding up.  Later that night Matt has his justice against this guy and leads to a great action scene.<br />The next day while at lunch with his assistant (talented Jon Favreau) he smells this woman from outside the diner.  She walks in and Matt follows her and just wants to know her name.  He grabs her, she says \\"I don't like to be followed and I don't like to be touched,\\" then they pull out the martial arts on each other.  After they're done she says \\"Elektra Naccios\\" (played by Jennifer Garner).  She is the daughter of a billionaire that is in trouble with the Kingpin (Micheal Clarke Duncan), the king of crime in Hell's Kitchen.  He has been squealing to the papers about the identity of the Kingpin.  The Kingpin hires Bullseye (Collin Farrell) to assassinate Naccios.  I won't tell the rest.<br />Ben Affleck and Collin Farrell hand in the best performances, while Jennifer Garner seems out of place but still is great to look at.  Micheal Clarke Duncan hands in a worthy performance also.  Also love the cameos by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith, great.  Mark Steven Johnson does a great job adapting the comic to the movie.  Darker than previous comic book movies, including more violence and murder.  Not as good as Spiderman in my opinion but a must have DVD.  Daredevil is a badass.  Looking forward to more movies done by Marvel.
B000002UCN|4.0|This album is a pretty cool mid 70's best of compilation, and is a necessity for any diehard fan.  Its odd selection and playing order makes it the bizarre anomaly that it is.  'Best of dark horse' released in the 80's is another must have, but both albums are now dated in content and concept, so remain unfulfilling as comprehensive testimonies to Harrison's genius.  The only 'best of' that could really do justice to Harrison's output would be a double cd: one to chronicle his work with the fab 4, and one to cover his solo work.  It would have to cover all phases of his career from 'Do you want to know a secret' to 'Any road'.  It would contain some of his early 'forgotten' work before '66, and all his solo hits including 'Ding dong ding dong'(his intelligent wackiness at its best, with the possible exception of 'Crackerbox palace').   now that would be a 'best of' album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film is fantastic.  I won't go into the plot as other reviews have already done so competently, so I'll relate my reaction to watching it.  <br />Every scene is a wonderful blend of child-like precocious-ness, fanciful animation, and fantastic story telling.  Every scene is imbued with mystery and a sense of wonderment and I found myself completely enchanted from beginning to end.  The characters are rich and interesting, the colors jump off the screen, and I was completely enraptured by the wonderful journey that this little girl embarked on.  Viewing this film is truly a delight that people of all ages can appreciate.<br />I recommend this film highly; even for an adult it is highly enchanting and wonderful.

It would contain some of his early 'forgotten' work before '66, and all his solo hits including 'Ding dong ding dong'(his intelligent wackiness at its best, with the possible exception of 'Crackerbox palace').   now that would be a 'best of' album.
B00005JLT5|5.0|There have been many movies made about the holocaust.  What does this movie add to what has already been said about the holocaust?  In my opinion, many such movies understandably and justifiably emphasize realism and factual represention of events.  Unfortunately, many directors do not have the skill to realistically depict hope under such circumstances.  For example, Spielberg's Schindler's List resorts to rather sophomoric narrative devices in its depiction of hope in the face of adversity.  When the list is first generated, we see Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley desperately thinking of name after name of people to save.  There is a build-up that felt like a scene in the locker room of the underdog team before the big game, or the &quot;you can do it&quot; speeches given to someone who's failed at something in the past.  It is typical Spielberg and it makes you feel like cheering Schindler on.  And, in the end, when Schindler laments he should have saved more, there is a sense of artifice and overdramatization.  This was not the holocaust.  There was no cheering and overdramatization.  People were scared for their lives, alone, focused on self-preservation, acting in secrecy and desparation.  The mood of Schindler's List overall was certainly sad and the scenes &quot;realistic&quot;, but I felt that Spielberg oversimplified and overdramatized the emotions and some events in order to emphasize hope.  It is this over-emphasis of hope that undermines Schindler's List, because it feels forced.  In The Pianist, no such simplification occurs.  This is an uncomprising, unflinching view of terrible events in one man's life that sustains hope for survival without phony plot devices and oversimplification.  It is somewhat documentary in style, without very much dialogue, special effects, or forced dramatization.  The events unfold simply, without artifice, and without prejudice.  If Spilzman died it would seem natural and expected given his circumstances.  The fact that he survives is exhilirating. This holocaust movie reveals the goodness in human nature in the face of the most terrible atrocities realistically and without compromise.  That has not been achieved in past holocaust movies very often or very succesfully..<br />The DVD itself is well designed.  The special features are interesting and revealing.  The video and sound transfers are excellent.
0142004235|4.0|It has been said that \\"East of Eden\\" is Steinbeck's best work, although it was \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" that garnered him the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. I personally prefer Steinbeck's earlier works, such as \\"Cannery Row,\\" \\"Sweet Thursday,\\" and \\"Tortilla Flat,\\" but found that \\"East of Eden\\" was worth the time to become reacquainted with this masterful author.<br />But this novel is lengthy at 600 pages. It's also complicated, multi-faceted, and requires patience and understanding to get through. You can read a lot into the story as an analysis of dysfunctional family life, or enjoy it for the incredible, intelligent piece of fiction that it is. Either way, it is well worth the journey.
0385509456|5.0|Perhaps the most amazing quality of fiction is its ability to put us into the heads of those who cannot - or never get a chance to - tell their own stories. It's nearly impossible to imagine what goes on in the minds of, say, serial killers, or brainwashed cult fanatics, or the mentally retarded, which might explain why we find it so fascinating when writers attempt to show us. Beneath its unwieldy title, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too. <br />Christopher is a fifteen-year-old, mildly autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon, a small town about a hundred miles outside London. His mother has passed away several years ago of cancer, so it's just Christopher and his father. During the days, Christopher attends a \\"special needs\\" school, where lessons include not only the three R's, but also tips on dealing with strangers and decoding facial expressions (Christopher can recognize happy and sad faces, but more complicated faces give him trouble). For a project, Christopher's teacher tells him to write a book about himself. Adding his own individual touches along the way (a math prodigy, the boy numbers his chapters not 1, 2, 3, but as prime numbers in ascending order), and peppering the text with illustrative tables and drawings, Christopher embarks on a detective story about Mrs. Shears's dog, stabbed to death in her yard with a garden fork. <br />Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes (whose logical mind he greatly admires), and solve the case. But his investigations unearth more about the relationships between his family and his neighbors than about the identity of the dog's killer. Unable to decode sarcasm, jokes, or figures of speech (he calls them all \\"lies,\\" since they aren't the truth), Christopher faithfully notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting. <br />Constantly bewildered by the (to him) incomprehensible behavior of those around him, Christopher resembles nothing so much as a human plunked down on a distant planet, trying desperately to figure out how to interpret the language and behavior of an alien species. And, in a way, many of Christopher's conclusions and actions make logical sense; but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Which is not to say Christopher can't also be infuriating, with his startling rigidity and resistance to change; he's prone to loss of bladder control and groaning fits when confused or scared by his surroundings - which is rather often. Nevertheless, he's deeply sympathetic and intensely believable, even if (like me) you've never met an autistic person before. <br />Other characters, such as Christopher's father and bereaved dog-owner Mrs. Shears, are realistically flawed and very convincing. They're not saints, by any means; Christopher's father tries hard to be patient, but can't control his frustration and anger, and all too often takes it out on his unresisting son. Mrs. Shears, for her part, is icily distant to Christopher. At first we assume that it's because of his insensitive poking into the death of her pet, but as the story progresses, we learn that her hostility stems from other, understandable (though not very noble) reasons. Obviously, Christopher's not responsible for his condition, and obviously he wouldn't have chosen to be as he is; but even though he can't help it, the boy is a heavy burden to those who must care for him, and frequent flare-ups of resentment and bitterness keep the story well away from saccharine TV-movie territory. <br />Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love.

B000021YQV|1.0|This album is chock-full of pretentious lyrics laden with goofy philosophic imagery that means absolutely nothing.  The verse from Chop Suey, \\"I don't think you trust in my self righteous suicide.  I, cry, when angels deserve to die,\\" is just one of many examples that strives so hard to drip with heavy meaning, but is silly and uninspiring, regardless of what context you ascribe to it.  90% of System of a Down's lyrics sound like a 6th grader's attempt to pen poetry for a Nine Inch Nails fanzine, and the other 10% reflect the band's ridiculous and uniformed politics.  This is another well-off rock band's whining about the problems of the world that guitars, bad facial hair, and refraining from personal hygiene just aren't going to solve.  Forget about originality, too- there's nothing said here that you hadn't heard elsewhere 20 years ago.<br />The musicians are pretty good, but just when a song's beginning grabs you, the singer's terrible voice enters, and you scramble to hit eject on your CD player.  If you find a way to eliminate vocals on your stereo while listening, you'll have a much better experience;  even entering the lyrics into a Speak-n'-Spell over the background instruments would be an improvement.<br />Tankian's attempts to hit upper registers with his voice sounds like the bleating of a sheep whose wool is set ablaze.  His singing in lower octaves isn't much better than that, since he takes himself so wickedly seriously, carefully and ostentatiously pausing and issuing forth words with as much theatrics as Robert Goulet.

B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl Crow waited four years between her 1998 masterpiece The Globe Sessions to put out a follow-up that was intended to be a great summer rock record that you could take with you to the beach. In between, she nearly suffered a nervous breakdown and appeared on soundtracks and tribute albums so much she barely had time to breathe during her down spells. Oh, and she was busy producing five songs on Stevie Nicks's masterwork Trouble in Shangri-la and singing on &quot;Fall From Grace.&quot;<br />The four year wait is usually a kiss of death for an artist who is now on the wrong side of 40 in the pop business, particularly one who is possibly trying to be viable in a Britney/Christina world. To be able to accomplish that task takes something unusual. <br />For Sheryl, the first single certainly qualifies. &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is one of those infectious numbers that will have even the non-Sheryl diehards bopping and singing along the first 9,999 times they hear it. After that, the song becomes yet another over-exposed Sheryl Crow number. Using a skin-baring video for that song that showcases Crow with a body women half her age would envy when another song berates &quot;all our pop stars look like porn,&quot; sounds a bit hypocritical. But I guess Crow can be forgiven somewhat, particularly if you're a straight man or a lesbian who finds her hot. <br />The rest of the album has its gems: Stevie Nicks appears twice, singing harmonies on the title track (one of the highlights), and on &quot;Diamond Road&quot; (which is one of the weak spots); &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; Crow's 9/11 tribute; and &quot;Steve McQueen.&quot; <br />However, Crow decides to try her hand at recording &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; which did MUCH better with Stevie's beguiling rasp and experience-weathered voice and the spare arrangements. With an intro that sounded like it was lifted from Joan Osborne's big hit &quot;What If God Was One Of Us&quot; and the harmonies from Gwyneth Paltrow, it makes you wonder what Crow was smoking, particularly when you hear &quot;You're Not The One&quot; from the &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; import single.<br />Considering the declining standards of today's music, C'mon C'mon may rate as one of the better pop albums of this decade. But the rating shows you how far the bar has been lowered in recent years, not how much Crow can lift the bar to throw the gauntlet down.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This masterpiece brilliantly directed by P.T. Anderson is perhaps my favorite film, for many reasons.<br />The film follows several lives during one day in San Fernando Valley, chances and strange happenstances affecting all of them. Child genius Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) lives with his pushy father (Michael Bowen) while competing in a game show, \\"What Do Kids Know?\\" and winning every time, always answering the questions instead of his team peers volunteering to answer. He is tired of always being pressured for the game show, and from his father's constant strain on him to be perfect. The host of the show, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) has developed cancer and will die in two months, depressed as ever. His wife Rose is beginning to realize that Jimmy's life may be a lie. His daughter, Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters) hates her father, is addicted to coke and is immediately attracted to police officer Jim Kurring(John C. Reilly). Back to the gameshow--Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) is lonely after being fired from his job and is in love with a male bartender, who doesn't show it back, and Donnie will do anything to get his attention. \\"What Do Kids Know Producer?\\" Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) has also contracted cancer and will inevitably die very soon. His wife, Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) married him only for his money, but is now in love with him. Earl's caretaker Phil Parma Philip Seymour Hoffman is holding onto the life of Earl while searching for the estranged Partridge son from Earl's previous marriage. This lost son has change his name to Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) and gives sex advice to men in seminars and videotapes. These stories seem to have connection, yes. But by the end, they have all intertwined to create a stunning, unanticipated and disturbing climax that makes this exquisite Hollywood film wonderful.<br />Every performance in this film is key, or else it will come off as a corny melodrama. It is certainly not that. Julianne Moore proves herself to be one of the best actresses currently out there. Tom Cruise's normally lifeless performance in films is not seen at all in \\"Magnolia\\". He grabs the audience by the throat and makes the film all more believable.<br />I love this movie because it shows how people can affect people, and how strange events aren't always coincidence. And then comes the ending! See this film if you are passionate about the cinema!
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is superb. I went and saw Damien play in England in February having only heard one song 'the professor' which isn't even on the album and I can safely say it was the most amazing gig ever. The album itself is full of haunting tracks and original songs that are matched by no one else. You can listen for hours and still find yourself almost brought to tears by its beauty. If you buy any album this year, make sure its this one, he deserves to be a superstar.
B00006H67M|5.0|Love Island captures a moment in 1978 when Eumir Deodato was on top of the world. This was his maiden release under Warner Bros. since his departure with MCA, and top notch session players are at the fore once again with warm melodies riding on phat basslines, sumptuous synthesiser waves and the presence of the legendary George Benson soloing in the centre section in the title track. Deodato also does a wonderful adaptation of Billy Strayhorn's classic Take The A Train. Also featured is very much half of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (Philip Bailey, Al McKay, Freddie White &amp; Verdine White) on Tahiti Hut. Deodato had pulled together a sound that would define an era. Out of all Deodato releases, this album contains 80% original material compared to his other releases which are half original and half adaptations. Love Island also bears a tropical theme throughout the entire CD from cover to content. Co-produced with the awesome Tommy Lipuma, Love Island is smooth jazz before that term suggested toothless, emotionally banal noodling, when it meant long hot nights danced to sultry, funk-drenched tunes and chilling out to tinkling synth grooves in the back of your white Cortina. This 2002 Warner UK remaster is the best re-issue to date. Recommeded tracks: Area Code 808, Tahiti Hut, San Juan Sunset, Love Island, Take The A Train.

B00005JLZN|5.0|The performances of Kevin Spacey, Laura Linney, and Kate Winslet are extraordinary in this sleeper hit.  Spacey plays David Gale, a philosophy professor and doting father who finds himself on Death Row for the rape and murder of his friend, Constance Hallaway (played by Laura Linney). With only three days before his scheduled execution, Gale chooses reporter Elizabeth Bloom, played by Winslet, for a series of final interviews to explain how he has been wrongly convicted.  \\"Bitsey\\", as Elizabeth goes by (it's a little hard to believe she allows herself to go by this nickname, as she seems to want to be taken seriously), finds herself caught up in Gale's story and becomes sympathetic with his misfortunes and she begins examining the loose threads that made up his eventual conviction.<br />If you have strong pro-death penalty opinions or are religiously devoted, and are not open minded about this issue, you may want to take a pass on this film.  Devoted Bush fans may also not be impressed, as you can't help notice the subtle poking fun of Texas and Texan politicians in the movie.<br />This movie is done with flashbacks, which creates suspense and interest.  The flashback scene that begins the movie is of a car breaking down, and this reoccurs and is foreshadowed throughout the movie enough so that by the end, you're pretty sure how things are going to turn out.  However, you will find yourself surprised because there's more to this film than a predictable ending and a nicely tied up story.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have never entered a review of a movie here before, especially when the DVD hasn't been released. But after reading two diatribe on this movie, I simply had to. It appears that the two reviewers who simply hated this movie, hated it for the wrong reason. One was practically a commercial for Moulin Rouge (which I also liked), while the other (Daniel Wahl) was a rant against the IDEA of the movie, rather than the movie itself. The fact that he didn't see the cynicism that was apparent within this movie meant he didn't get it! Wait till he finds out that the stage version has been out since the early 70's (the revival is still playing to full houses on Broadway and on the road). He'll whine about that too.<br />Both of them missed the reason you write one of these things: HOW IS THE ACTUAL MOVIE? It is a damn good one, and very entertaining. I went with a bunch of people who were ready to hate the movie, especially since they have never liked musicals in general, both in movies and at the theaters. We all came out smiling and ready to buy the DVD the day it comes out. Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere - who knew they could sing? Catherine Zeta Jones, to me, was the real star, handling some of the most demanding dance and singing sequence.<br />But all these are superimposed on the backdrop of the cynicism of the story. One would find it rather uncanny when viewed through what happened with the O.J. Simpson trial (Did Johnny Cochran learned all the tricks from Billy Flynt?). I would even equate the cynicism seen in Chicago as that presented in the movie Brazil (with the original director's ending).
0792165020|4.0|&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is about a young man named Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who discovers, as a result of a fateful accident involving a jacket with the Princeton emblem upon it, that he can pass himself off as someone he is not.  Given that he is not much to begin with, this is a startling revelation.  His initial lie affords him an opportunity to travel to Europe on a mission to persuade a prodigal son, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), to come home.  Living the good life with Dickie and his girl friend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tom comes to the conclusion that he could be a better Greenleaf than Greenleaf himself.  After all, Dickie is cheating on Marge and wasting his time (and his father's money) on jazz clubs and living the decadent life in sunny Italy.  Meanwhile, Tom finds his talents for impersonation are becoming quite formidable and the only problem is that Dickie's friend Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is suspicious of a young man who wears Dickie's clothes, eats Dickie's food, and gets Dickie's parents to pay for it all.  Consequently the viewer is left with two compelling questions.  How far will Tom be able to go with his efforts and can be possibly get away with it?<br />I know of several people who objected to Ripley being portrayed as a homosexual, offended that this would be presented as his motive for the bad, bad things that he does.  However I see this element as being more ironic in terms of the character.  Keep in mind that the story is set in the 1950s, when what the conventional idea aobut what came out of the closet was not someone who was gay but a monster (and despite his natural charm, Tom Ripley is a monster).  This does not mean that gays are monsters and the suggestions of Ripley's homosexuality have nothing to do with the motivation for his crimes.  Instead it suggests another level of attraction to Greenleaf for Tom and the irony that he is aspiring to a life of a notorious womanizer when he is not overly interested in either Marge or Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett).  This raises an interesting question: Is Tom trying to become Dickie Greenleaf because it is a life he desires above all others or because it is a life that he can assume because of his talents?<br />One of the strengths of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is how director Anthony Minghella makes us take Tom Ripley's perspective throughout the film.  Even if he is the bad guy in the film and not a person in whom we are likely to readily see ourselves, he is also the movie's protagonist.  Even though it might be against our better judgment part of us roots him on through his endeavors.  After all, if Dickie Greenleaf is not going to make anything worthwhile out of his life, Tom might be able to do better.  The result is a solid suspense film with which Minghella has invested some of the style of Italian cinema from the 1950s.  Final Note: I sure was glad I did not know that Patricia Highsmith had written a series of novels about Tom Ripley, of which this is the first, because that sort of gives some broad hints as to how this particular story is going to play out.terested in either Marge or Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett).

B00009V7RF|1.0|\\"Bridging the Gap\\"...a great record.  \\"Elephunk\\"...what is this garbage.  If you like 50Cent, I guess you'll like this record.  If I had the choice, I would give this record ZERO STARS!!!  BEPs USED to be one of the more creative hip hop groups.  Now they are just like all the other cookie-cutter groups out there.  I don't mind when artists try to grow and change but when you start putting out garbage just because...well, it's time to quit.  I think there's a reason why they don't tell you on the jewel case that Justin Timberlake is featured on this record.  If they did, no true hip hop fan would buy this garbage!  No, you did not misread this.  To all true hip hop (and MUSIC) fans, Justin Timberlake of the talentless boy bands is featured on the track \\"Where is the Love.\\"  This record is a waste of time and hard earned cash.  I listened to it once then immediately drove to my nearest used record store and sold it!  If you want REAL HIP HOP, I highly suggest \\"The Ownerz\\" by GangStarr or \\"Kristyles\\" from KRS-One.  Those are two records by two legends of hip hop that won't disappoint.  If you love hip hop, do the art of hip hop (and music in general) a favor and don't put money in the pockets of BEP or the talentless cookie-cutter Timberlake.  Kick down the $ for GangStarr and KRS who have been doing it right and from the heart for years.
B00005YW4H|5.0|&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; brings to mind smoky, dim-lit, late-night jazz clubs, with a single talented singer on the stage. That singer is Grammy-winner Norah Jones, with her bluesy jazz music and soft, smooth vocals. Only a few minutes of Norah's singing will win you over.<br />&quot;Come&quot; starts on a melancholy note, with Norah mourning at abandoning her chance to be with the unnamed love of &quot;Don't Know Why.&quot; The sweetly innocent &quot;Seven Years,&quot; the slightly seductive &quot;Cold Cold Heart,&quot; the whisper and shimmer of the title track, the reflective melancholy of &quot;Shoot The Moon&quot; (&quot;Now the fall is here again/ You can't begin to give in/It's all over&quot;), the low-key sensual &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; the lonely-cowboy lullaby &quot;Lonestar&quot; continue the mood of ups and downs; at the end, Jones sings quietly that &quot;With no reprise/The sun will rise/The long day is over,&quot; and finishes up with the beautiful &quot;Nearness of You.&quot;<br />The simplicity of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is part of its beauty. Jones' voice is genuinely, honestly beautiful, sweet and soft and rich. There's little if any enhancement of her vocals, adding to the feeling that you're listening to her directly, not to songs recorded in a studio.<br />And the music is meant as a backdrop for her singing: simple acoustic and electric guitars, bass and drums, sometimes an organ, and most importantly, piano. Mostly jazz, but laced with tinges of country music, this is a hard-to-classify hybrid. The songs tend to be sweetly evocative, sometimes sensual and sometimes sad, sometimes romantic and sometimes just sweet (&quot;It's not the pale moon that excites me/That thrills and delights me, oh no/It's just the nearness of you&quot;).<br />The beautifully sweet, cozy feel of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is one that is hard to find anywhere else. Play this album from beginning to end, and find someone to hold close to you in a candlelit room.t room.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Why, everyone know this if the Turandot to puts all others to shame. It outsells all other Turandots 5 to 1. Call Decca to confirm, ok? Why is this so. Sutherland, Caballe and Mr. King of tenors. You say Nilsson? I say she sceams every note and is out of tune. You can bet that Joan Sutherland is the only Turandot who can deals with the extreme high tessitura of Turandot with not only ease, but finesse. Get real, In Esclamonde, Sutherland faces far more intense orchestral assault (160 piece orchestra) and she gently throws two high Ds form an octave below and holds it. Now, that, no one in the entire world can do. And I ask you all to say anyone can do it to answer this review! Since a high D is nothing to her, what is a C to her? Breathing, that's what it is to her, it's the act of breathing, darn D in alt is nothing to her. <BR>Caballe, a personal favorite of mine is the last word in bel canto singing, and her pianissimi singing can never be matches by anyone. And Pavarotti sings the &quot;Nessum Dorma&quot; that ends all others. Zubin mehta seals this as the Turandot to put all others to shame, and to their retirement. One of the greatest opera ever recorded by the Gods of singing. Get it, before Decca raises it's price!
B00006690H|5.0|I like this CD a lot.  Eminem is definatley a very talented rapper.  He is also very passionate about his daughter Hailie.  I just think he should lay off some of the curses a little.  A Lot of kids are not allowed to buy his cd.  So in cunclusion i think this cd is exellent.
B000002MUW|3.0|I don't know what prompted me to buy this, since I already had two of the best songs on here(Take a Bow, Secret) and the lackluster Forbidden Love. Maybe it was because I found it used on here and loved the artwork-anyhow, the album disappointed me, except for Secret, Take a Bow, Human Nature, and Sanctuary.  <BR>The album opens with Survival(3/5), an unknown song of hers that has her sounding very melancholy. Made me feel sorry for her. However, she picks up the pace with Secret(6/5) which I have always loved. The album slides down with the worst track on here, I'd RAther Be Your Lover(2/5) Lyrically this reminds me of Justify My Love, which was superb, but this one is just bland and lacks substance. Next is the dance number Don't Stop(4/5) It's a little repetitive, but nice to get you movin'! Inside of Me(2/5) is drowned out by the heavy breathing in the background and is NOT a good song about her mother- I'll take Promise to Try, Mer Girl, or Mother and Father any day. Human Nature(6/5) is an awesome track-and this is the DIRTY version*giggles* not the clean one on GHV2. Track 7 is Forbidden Love(3/5) this appeared on STR and i don't know why. It wasn't a hit, and it isn't that memorable. Love Tried to Welcome Me(4/5) is a nice ballad that was never a hit, along with the beautiful Sanctuary(6/5) which SHOULD have been a hit, or if she was gonna have non hits on STR should have been on in place of Forbidden Love. Track 10 is Bedtime Stories(3/5), which is Madonna's only lackluster title track. Track 11 is Take a Bow(6/5) which is the exact same as on STR. It closes up Madonna's most lackluster album. Overall Grade-89/100 B+<BR>What's good on here is Great, and what's bad isn't terrible. All in all, I'd recommend Something to Remember or Erotica over this, but I'd still recommend this album. It's not bad in the least, but it's not her best by far.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A weaving, spinning, multi-layered tapestry that reveals more with each listen. Melodic and accessible, yet simultaneously distant and challenging.
B00005Q66T|2.0|Okay, this a very disappointing CD. You are better off buying her four albums of the '90's and very early '00's. That way you get the original an dnot horribly edited versions of the songs on here(exception:the Music album) Also, when you buy the Beautiful Stranger and DCFMA singles, you get the ALBUM VERSION of Beautiful Stranger, plus two remixes and the DANCE REMIXES of DCFMA which WAS the hit! Everyone's saying \\"Where's Rain? Whenre's This Used to Be  My PLayground? Where's You'll See?\\" Ever hear of the Something to Remember CD? They are on there, and STR is a MUCH better purchase than this CD. However, the artwork is great, and I DO recommend this CD to the casual Madonna fan who wants a snapshot of her '90's work.

B00001OH7V|5.0|Lots of critics like to pigeonhole this album as being one of Bowie's gloomy, electronic masterpieces, set in the middle of the 'Berlin Trilogy'. On the contrary! This album is highly energetic. It's one of his best dance records ever...a very funky and disjointed amalgam of R&B, Krautrock, soul and rock'n'roll. Bowie has been able to stay consist for one reason only(and it isn't for being a \\"chameleon\\"): he's kept his R&B roots in tact while creatively and successfully augmenting them with styles around him: rock, electronics, avant garde, disco, folk, etc etc. This forms the core of Heroes. Joe The Lion, Beauty And The Beast, Blackout -- all sway and strut along with the fattest rhythms he's ever put down. If your looking for plastic soul, look no further than Sons Of The Silence Age...it's golden! The Secret Life Of Arabia, which i think is worth the album price alone, is a great slice of decadant/Euro-trashed/cabaret/cokehead disco. It slinks along like some wonderfully black glittery party. VERY SEXY INDEED! Then thru all the plastic pulsing comes the warm and passionate Heroes. This song is just gorgeous in it's melody and lyrical content. Oh, hehe, the instrumentals are quite good as well. They have an edgier finish than the Low instrumentals, sounding like modern granular synthetics mixed with musique concrete -- very spiffy indeed!
B00005N83M|5.0|If I had to pick J Lo's very best album, this would be it. This album is sort of a mixed bag- a bit of Latin(Ain't It Funny, CArino, Dame, Si Ya Se Acabo) club songs(PLay, Dance With Me) ballads(Secretly, That's Not Me, Come Over) and everything else.<BR>Here is a rundown of the tracks: The album opens with the big hit, high energy opener Love Don't Cost a Thing(5/5)  Don't tell me you don't recognize it, it's on the radio a lot. Next is I'm Real(4/5)-this one's a lot longer than the Radio Edit, and a lot better. Only drawback is it's overplayed. Next on the list is Play(5/5)-yes, it's very similar to Madonna's Music, boo hoo. Name me a female pop artist after 1985 that WASN'T influenced by Madonna! People, Hamlet and King Lear were rip offs of previously existing plots! Anyhow, Play is a great track, and one of my favorite hits of hers. Walkin' On Sunshine (5/5) is a beautiful fast track that is the answer to her 1999 hit Waiting for Tonight. A shame it wasn't released as a single. Ain't it Funny(6/5) this is the original version, Latin flavored. One of my picks for the three best songs on the CD. Carino(5/5) is another Latin like song-reminds me more of Spain than Latin America. Come Over(4/5) is the first ballad on this CD. It sounds similar to Dear Ben off her god awful follow up to this album. We Gotta Talk(3/5) has a nice beat, but the lyrics are a flop. Track 9, That's Not Me(5/5) is a girl power tune about being equal to a guy in a relationship. Go J LO! This and Madonna's Express Yourself are more girl power than the Spice Girls could ever be! Dance With Me(6/5) is my second pick for the best song on this album. Similar to Play, but a fraction of a second slower, it's still a fast song. The beat is techno-y and the lyrics rock- BTW, she wrote this one with Puffy! TNext is the third ballad, Secretly(3/5) She wants to be Janet Jackson on this one, and I even thought it was Janet when I heard it at Jazzercise. Track 12 is I'm GOnna be Alright(6/5), my third choice for the best song on this album. This is not the Track Masters Remix you hear on the radio, this version is MUCH better. Much more Latin flavored. Next is That's the Way(4/5) It employs a tropical beat and it works. DAme(5/5) is a duet with Chayenne whom I'd never heard of before. Except for the word \\"Baby\\" this song is done entirely en espanol. Same with Si Ya Se Acabo(4/5) only this is just J Lo alone. Not as good as Dame. The album closes with the I'm Real Murder Remix featuring Ja Rule(5/5) I like this remix, don't get me wrong, but a better choice would have been the Ain't it Funny remix. Overall grade 95/100 A. THis is J Lo's best CD. You should buy it! If you buy only J Lo album, buy this one. If you want to be a  J LO fan, start with this, go back one to On the 6, then the remix album, and then her newest one, THis is Me...Then. Those are the rankings of her albums.
B00004W52U|5.0|Energy by Operation ivy is a near perfect ska punk release and highlights when Tim Armstrong was at the height of his career (music wise). With energy you get exactly what the album is called constant energy right up to the last track along with the best tracks such as bad town and freeze up, Operation Ivy where probably one of the only ska bands that really mattered to me along with a few that are still around. I would highly recommened this to anybody into the ska genre and you dont even have to like Rancid to be into Operation Ivy in my opinion, this is one of the quintessential ska cd's that you can get hold of.
B00003CXXO|1.0|I agree with the reviewer from Shelton. Completely. I too dosed off, amazed it was still going, and then begging for it to stop. A great artist knows when something is finished, when to leave it alone. I like science movies, but when I saw Spielberg on the cover, I knew I wasn't going to need sugar for the next three months.<br />I was actually glad to see that Steven Saccharineberg adapted this film from a short story (with a great title by the way). Maybe this film was itself a fairy tale. If it was, it was badly done. Maybe Terry Gilliam would have been better for the job. If it was going to be a though-provoking science vs. ludites movie, it failed as well. Go see Kubrick's 2001 instead (Kubrick co-produced AI, I noticed). <br />Again, Steven, learn to end your stories when it's still believable, and stop the family values grist mill!! Also, New York skyscrapers do fall apart after 2,000 years. And, also, it takes more than an hour to drive (let alone swim) from midtown Manhattan to Coney Island (if you don't hit traffic!)<br />Artificial Intelligence is an interesting topic, but not for Spielberg. You started good, but then it became a circus that never ends...
0671578855|5.0|This book is just awesome. It has everything you could ask for in a book: lovable and complex characters, humor, and a great plot. Miles in romeo/domestic mode is just plain hilarious. Using his Admiral Naismith-methods of wooing Ekaterin, a widow who has sworn off marriage, he causes scene after scene of humor, disasters, and clumsiness. Combine that with Mark's get-rich-quick scheme involving bugs that make butter, strong female characters, and a fight in corriders of a high Vor house involving &quot;bug butter&quot; splashing... and you have the recipe for a great book. I mean, Miles' parents meet the girl with an introduction from Miles of &quot;Let me introduce you to.... she's getting away!&quot; <br />There isn't so much scifi to this book as there is romantic comedy. But, it isn't just for girls. It has political intrigue and a good strong plot as well. It's a chance for the readers to see Miles struggling to be something besides a soldier, and Bujold does a beautiful job. <br />Unfortunately, the Vorkosigan saga (and this book in particular) has set a new standard for me with the scifi genre. Now I want everything, especially a unique society such as the Vor one. So I find myself unhappy with most of my books, feeling they just aren't putting enough effort in.
B000002U9Y|5.0|What's not to love about it? If you like the later albums, dripping with pessimism and repeated lyrics about mental illness (DSOTM-era), you may not like this early Floyd gem. If you like the early Floyd, you will love this. Every song here is great, even the soothing (See-Saw), not as boring as the band have said it is. &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; is my favourite Pink Floyd song, and one of their best, and &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; end the album on a bit of a sad note, for it was to be Syd's last contribution as a member of the band. Get this, and &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; now! Chances are the only Floyd you've heard is the later stuff, you may be in for a pleasant surprise!
B000002C1W|4.0|After departure of Roger Waters Pink floyd was close to the end...but they didn't finish as an old rock pantheon group - they made two great albums that shown that Pink Floyd is surely not Roger Waters band...<br />First of all - David gilmour (vocals,guitars) is replacing Roger waters (vocals,bass) as a frontman.Before he was standing in a shadow of Roger's bombastic character and his introwertic lyrics. Now as he takes the wheel after him the music sounds more fresh, less depresing but sadly more polished....This is the only fault of tis album.the songs are great<BR>After the calm opening &quot;the signs of life&quot; bands explodes in fantastic big hit &quot;Learning to fly&quot;. Nice catchy melody,unforgettable guitar works and characteristic choirs.Tasty!!!! straight to the end the album is solid. &quot;Dogs of war&quot; with interesting jazzy saxophone part, another hit &quot;one slip&quot;, charming ballad &quot;on the turning away&quot; and famous &quot;Sorrow&quot; are not leaving any doubt that Pink floyd was one of the most interesting and amazing rock bands ever...<BR>It was my first Cd of Pink floyd i ever bought, it is maybe not quintesential album but surely very well done and great to listen!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|I wasn't sure if I should buy the cd, I had heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and really liked it.  I took a chance, and I was very happy with the results.  Amy Lee's voice is really what gives the band a unique sound.<br />The Tracks:<BR>1. Going Under - One of my favorite songs on the cd.  It has so much energy and gets the cd started right.<BR>2. Bring Me To Life - You've heard it on the radio.  I'm sure you have an opinion on it.<BR>3. Everybody's Fool - Starts slower, but is a solid song.<BR>4. My Immortal - The first slow song.  You really get a sense of Amy's range.<BR>5. Haunted - This one takes a while to get going, but it's called 'haunted' so what else do you expect?<BR>6. Tourniquet - An up-tempo song.  Plenty of energy.<BR>7. Imaginary - Another song where Amy's voice makes a lasting impression.<BR>8. Taking Over Me - The chorus gets stuck in your head.<BR>9. Hello - Slow song that stays slow.<BR>10. My Last Breath - Has a weird intro, but then takes on that characteristic quality that Evanescence has.<BR>11. Whisper - The song is as good as any of the others.
B000088E6P|5.0|ok i just bought this cd today and i dont know much songs but the songs i heard were great!!!if your not sure about geting it because:you think he might staill talk about killing!no way!!this cd is very edited!!!!!!!!and it is sweeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!!!!!!i only knew about 7 songs!now i know more!!!i know you probably dont care what i think,but i think you will injoy it just as much as me!!i realy like:what up gangsta,patiently waiting,dont push me,and lifes on the line!!!!!great songs!!!!!p.s.i will be back to write another review after i have heard more songs!!!!see ya!
055357342X|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  The story is intricate and well-written, the characters are great, and you really never know what might happen next.  Don't assume anything when reading these books.  You are bound to be surpised.  <br />I do have to say that what I like best about these books are the characters.  Just as in real life, the characters aren't 100% good or 100% bad - they are very complex, and you just may find yourself really caring about one of the &quot;bad&quot; guys.  Each new book will introduce at least one new point of view, and you really get to see many facets of each character.<br />George RR Martin does not scimp on words - these are all hefty novels, but in my opinion well worth it.  I could not put them down (in fact my husband was relieved when he found out that the 4th one was not out yet, because he could not get me off of the couch while I was reading the first 3).  And that brings me to the worst part of the whole thing - we have to wait until June 2004 for the next book.  Every book I have picked up since I finished 'Storm of Swords' has paled by comparison.  I have not found anything that even comes close.  So if you are starting this series, be warned: the wait for the 4th book could very well make you crazy.  I guess it's time to start reading the first book again!
0520215850|5.0|Excellent Book!- hard to understand if you have never read anything about the three kingdoms before<br />I've played the video games about it so i understood it better<br />Definite buy for a Chinese history fan!
B00009XITQ|5.0|This movie is about a young girl (Amanda Bynes) who wants to find her dad who lives in England. I thought that this movie was exilerating. It was the best movie Amanda Bynes have starred in. This movie has comedy and romance. Since I'm more the comedy type and not the romantic type I tell you that this movie is both and great for everybody. You'll love it! You'll laugh and cry throughout the movie....guarentee it!
B00005QDW1|5.0|This CD is one of the best CDs I own because it's by the best band the world has ever produced!<br />Intro- I sort of like it.  It's a unique way to start off a unique album. 4/5<br />Hella Good- One of my favorites on the CD!  Very punk-rock.  It has a great tune and whenever I hear it I feel like dancing. 5/5<br />Hey Baby- One of their poppier songs.  It's very weird to hear this song come from them.  It's sort of a Britney Spears type song. 5/5<br />Making Out- Not one of their best songs, but I love the tune!  It sort of makes no sense.  Oh well, still good. 4/5<br />Underneath It All- A great, relaxing song.  One of their slow songs on the CD.  I love this song. 5/5<br />Detective- Sort of weird, but a good song.  The chorus is sort of stupid.  I like the song, though.  Just...weird. 4/5<br />Don't Let Me Down- The Upbeat melody makes it fun!  It's really a great song and I like it a lot. 5/5<br />Start The Fire- I don't like the tune.  The bagpipes are weird, but No Doubt sort of has a theme for each song. 3/5<br />Running- A song to think about.  Very good.  It's another slow song. 5/5<br />In My Head- One of my least favorites. 2/5<br />Platinum Blonde Life- A great tune.  Strange words. 5/5<br />Waiting Room- Another Least Favorite. 2/5<br />Rock Steady- Too slow.  Not one I like alot. 3/5
B000002UAX|3.0|This is the biggest Beatles album. But the best? At least 6 of their albums are better. This is an amalgamation of 4 solo albums and as such barely qualifies as a Beatles album at all. It was an accurate preview of their work after the breakup. But George Martin and George Harrison were right in saying that half of these songs should have been cut.<BR> The interesting thing about this album is that it was their first in which no songs had been or would be released as singles. So if you wanted to hear any of it you had to buy all of it. For much of this album, they were in the relatively unfamiliar territory of the blues. Being great at the blues is almost impossible because its all been done before.<BR> There are maybe a dozen songs here where the creativity, performance and production approaches their own high standards. But even the best songs here(Julia, Blackbird, While My Guitar..., and Back in the USSR) are not among the best these guys have written. Is there anything here extraordinary in the power or beauty in its music &amp;/or lyrics? No, this is a pretty good album packaged with 16 demos of variable quality. No band is infallible, not even the Beatles.
B00005JM1Y|3.0|One of the funniest actors in the trade, Rowan Atkinson is responsible for many hilarious appearances as Mr. Bean.  But if your looking for another classic Bean performance, this is not the movie for you.  Atkinson is again funny as ever but the movie is redundant and puts Atkinson in situations that are to scripted and not the silliness that a hardcore Bean fan is used to.<BR>    This is defiantly a very fun and hilarious movie that includes lots of humor and funny scenes and will delight young audiences.  The movie can get boring at times and even the youngsters will get bored with redundant and insignificant scenes.  But they will be satisfied.  <BR>   You follow Johnny English through his embarrassing adventures as he tries to be a master spy.  He never quite becomes a great agent, or even an adequate agent but does end up saving his country by being crowned King of England.  This should give you an idea of the seriousness of this movie.<BR>   If you want a few cheap laughs, then this a classic.  But for the regular moviegoer, this is a funny movie but can be boring because of a complete lack any sort of plot.<BR>  <BR>See this movie if: <br />You are a big Bean Fan<BR>You love movies just for Laughs<BR>Aged 10 or younger<br />Do Not See this movie if:<br />You like comedies with a recognizable plot<BR>You dislike kiddie humor
B00006CYAD|5.0|Simple Plan Is One Of The BEST Punk Pop Bands Ever, They're Amazing, Thats A CD You Must Have, It Has 2 Exellent Bonus Tracks... Its Just An Awesome Band... Just Awesome Great... They're Music Rocks... Defenitely One Of The BEST BANDS IN THE WORLD
B00004T0UT|5.0|This is fantastic music. No doubt about it. I fully agree with the positive reviews. However, I recommend buying the 2 CD &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; collection issued in 1999 instead of this one simply because it has every track on this album and several more besides. That is all.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|The public is getting sick of hollywood. Times are changing, movie plots seem to repeat themselves more then those awful songs on the radio. Innovative directors (like Richard Kelly) are commitied to bringing art based movies to life. That is exactly what Donnie Darko penetrates...the risky chance of creating a new type of movie.<BR>In the DVD itself, the director points out that this film, while having a structure and definate ending, is certainly open for personal interpretation. Similar to a conceptual painting, viewing this movie takes an incredible amount of intimate focus. The plot is not served on a silver plate like most movies. One must concentrate, evaluate, love, trust, and solve the many mysteries of the characters and goals. Truely unique, you slowly start to comprehend Donnie and his situation (i liked the comparisons to \\"catcher in the rye\\"). The ambitious mix of genres is just a desperate way to try and define this conceptual drama. Those who rated it poorly did so because the film insulted their intelligence. And it will insult your intelligence, too.<BR>I gave this film 4 stars simply because while it is undeniably original, it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. There are many issues that needed to be cleaned up (continuity, some acting (jake however was amazing), cutting VERY IMPORTANT SCENES). I hope to see this new generation of film making in the future. It has given me faith that the enertainment industry of this disgustingly capitalistic society still might have a chance. Maybe my generation will actually be encouraged to think. As a senior in highschool i will hope to show this film to as many friends as possible. You should do the same...
0812548094|4.0|I have read the first book and I have to say that this is the best series to come along yet! I am an avid reader of fantasy/ sci-fi and am very picky about my books. This series hit the spot. As Richard is taken away from his beloved Kahlan, you feel the pain that defines just how deep their love for each other goes. And it starts you on a journey that only surprises and pleases the need for unusual and imaginative plots and twists. There is also a good dose of humor. You find yourself supporting Richard in his vow to remain unkempt and surly towards his captor. The rest of the characters in this book only adds to the story that you know will appear in future books. The Sisters prove to be despicable and lovable at the same time. I only hope that Goodkind continues to write in this intriguing manner.
B00006LI4S|4.0|'Nuff said!  Buy this DVD.
0679745203|5.0|This very original novel has more style than any other novel I have read from the last twenty years.  Ondaatje's style jumps points-of-view and timelines but does it in an understandable and clear way.  It often follows a train-of-thought style but is a much easier read than any books I have read with this style.  The mood is a somber war-time mood that really creates the story and adds an intense feel to the novel.  This is a brilliant book.  Everything from setting to character relationships to style melds to create the perfect historical romance.  Ondaatje has done a wonderful job here.<br />This novel brings together four varied characters at the end of World War II.  Hana, a Canadian;  Caravaggio, an Italian;  Kip, an Indian;  and the nameless English patient.  Hana is a nurse staying in an Italian villa that had been used as a temporary hospital;  she is looking out for the Englishman who was burned when his plane crashed and caught on fire;  Caravaggio is a friend of Hana's father and is at the villa because he has learned she is there;  Kip is a sapper who is staying at the villa while extinguishing bombs in the area.<br />This book taught me much about the time period, but more importantly, it taught me about relationships.  The relationships between Kip, Caravaggio, Hana, and the Englishman were each very different but all very real.  Ondaatje creates a realistic world with here that you can just fall into.  My interest was maintained all the way through the novel, regardless of the sometimes choppy style.<br />This is a great book for any lovers of history, romance, or simply any good book!  I highly recommend The English Patient.
B000084T18|5.0|It's called rap. And it's impossible for a new album to satisfy every single person. But this album with its use of beats, rhythm, rapping by 50 Cent, along with the music is phenomenal, especially when compared to Ja's newest album, The Last Temptation, which is only pop. Best tracks are Patiently Waiting, Don't Push Me, 21 Questions, P.I.M.P., and Heat.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Finally! A director and a cinematographer with the courage to use the whole screen, and not \\"play to the middle\\" for the standard screen DVD market and the late-night television crowd.  Finally! A soundtrack that is natural and enhances a film, rather than distract from it. Finally! A film that made me forget \\"Alias\\" and that whole Ben/J Lo thang.<br />Warning!! The promotion department and the media should CEASE AND DESIST from any and all comparisons to Spiderman.  They are very different. The only thing that Spiderman, Smallville, and Daredevil have in common is the unique vision of their creators to both honor the original comic creators and bring a new vision of these mythic people and places.  This film comes from a dark place of bereavement.  Ben Affleck's performance of the battle-weary \\"guardian devil\\" was superb, and entirely believeable. And the whole screen lights up when natural beauty Jennifer Garner appears (minus that annoying old movie star filter that Alyssa Milano has taken to using)!  That Fisk and Murdock are real men makes their faceoff even more frightening.  And of course, none of it would have been convincing, if it hadn't been for the powerful storyline involving Murdock's prizefighter father.  I especially liked the crusading reporter aspect, and the use of the church as a sanctuary and safe place. <br />I'll admit that I'm at a disadvantage having never read the comic series, but I will now seek it out. It gave me a \\"reel\\" good feeling to see Stan Lee's name unfurl on the screen.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Sure, it has the majority of Floyd's works.  <br />A few problems are present though:  <BR>1. Marooned is shorter than the version from The Division Bell<BR>2. Echoes is also around 16 minutes, not the awesome 24 (I realize this is beacuse the disc can only hold 80 mins. of music)<BR>3. Why is Us and Them not right after Money?<BR>4. Where's Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Dogs, Have a Cigar, and Lucifer Sam?<br />The good stuff:<BR>1.  It flows very nicely for a greatest hits album<BR>2.  You still get your money's worth of music<br />Summary:<BR>Good music, but the original albums are where the power is from.  There are a lot more songs that can added.  All-in-all, one of the best greatest hits albums out there.
6305508550|4.0|Seriously, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  (I would probably even say it is the funniest office-based movie of all time, except that now, The BBC's \\"The Office\\" I think is honestly, flat out, the funniest office-based comedy.  I know, it's a t.v. show, but fans of the Office - get your buddy to tape these episodes.  It's a cross between \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" and \\"Office Space\\".)  <br />The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that it starts out a little slow, and ends a little slow.  But, the middle 3/4's are seriously hilarious. I have only had 1 friend of about 10 think the movie was so so, and that's a lot of different opinions.  Anyway, we quote it at work all the time.  BUY IT.
1573229725|5.0|... because seriously, Sarah Waters creates such an intense environment that you feel like you're actually in the book, living in the atmosphere. This book is spellbinding and captivating and once you pick it up, you honestly can NOT put it down. This has become my new favorite book. I cry every night because Waters has only written 3 books and I have read 2 of them already. But you will deeply enjoy this book. Really.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just tossing my opinion into the ring.  This series is fantastic and lives up to every other review on here.  Buy it!
B00005YW4H|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst albums I have bought in years!   Norah shows absolutely know emotions in any of these songs.  She stays on the same note throughtout the entire album! Because of her lack of vocal range and infliction its very hard to know when one song ends and a new one begins!  So much hype for such a horrible album! <br />Heres a run down on each of the songs.  I'm using a scale of 1 to 10.  1 being horrible and 10 being really good<br />Don't Know Why:  I liked this song the first million times I heard it!  Now its old and boring!  4<br />Seven Years:  Along with most of the songs on this album this song is very boring!  She shows know emotion in this song....oh wait she shows know emotion in any of the songs!  1<br />Cold Cold Heart:  Read the one above!  1<br />Feelin' The Same Way:  I'm Feelin' The Same Way about this song as I did the 2 above this one!  1<br />Come Away With Me:  This song was the reason I bought this cd!  This song is by far the best on this album! Its a very sensesual and mellow song!  Absolutely beautiful!  8<br />Shoot The Moon: I kind of like this song but not alot!  5<br />Turn Me On:   This song is pretty good!  But still boring!  4<br />I've Got To See You Again:  I've Got To Skip This Song Again! Absolutely HORRIBLE!  1<br />Painter Song:  HORRIBLE!  The music is hideous and her voice makes me scream!  1<br />One Flight Down: Its an ok song!  But needs improvement.  3<br />Nightingale:  BORING! 1<br />The Long Day Is Over:  This song isn't to bad but still sounds like every other song on this album! 2<br />The Nearness of You:  I hate this song the most out of all of them!  1<br />Bottom Line....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE ALBUM!
0449227421|1.0|The Third Twin is the fourth Follett book I've read and it ranks a distant last.  In Dangerous Fortune, Night over Water and Pillars of the Earth, Follett takes the reader on a journey into the past with different cultures and different customs.  His characterization makes each period come alive.<br />The Third Twin is different in that it is set in the present day.  It is a traditional, sub-par thriller that is made worse by Follett's political bias or ignorance.  I'll mention more on that later.  Jeannie Ferrami studies identical twins and her studies leads her to some facts that some certain bad guys don't want to be discovered.  Ferrami and one of her subjects race against the three bad guys to expose the bad guys for the evil people that they are.<br />It is true that they were evil, but Follett does a horrible job of making me fear this people or making me think they are worthy bad guys.  In the beginning of the book, Follett says Senator Proust has photos of himself with Rush Limbaugh, Geraldo Riveria and Newt Gingrich.  Later a reference is made to Barry Goldwater as a hero to one of the bad guys. The bad guys are also mentioned to be in favor of gun control.  Now, to a liberal, these aren't ideal beliefs, but they hardly make a person evil.  Yet, Follett fails to do anything else to characterize the bad guys as evil.<br />So we are supposed to believe they are bad because they are Republican.<br />Also, the three bad guys are involved in cloning and genetic engineering.  To me, Follett implies that this is a right-wing issue and that only conservatives would use genetics to create the type of humans they want.  This book was several years old, but as far as I can tell, this is a political neutral issue.  There are wackos on both sides willing to use genetics to engineer humans.<br />I don't know if Follett is a bigot against conservatives or just naïve to think that throwing in some liberal buzzwords would be all he would need to do to create the sense that the bad guys truly are bad in this novel.<br />Politics aside, this story was interesting yet I found much of the dialogue between characters both childish and stating the obvious.  I never felt like Ferrami those helping her were fighting to stop something truly evil.  Maybe that is because the main plan they were trying to stop was the sale of a genetics firm in which Senator Proust would get $60 million to run for president.  Follett himself makes this implausible by making Proust such an unlikeable character.  Also, selling a firm for money doesn't just lead to being president.  So I never really feel like the unlikeable Proust will get the power that he wants.<br />I plan on reading more Follett but will stick to the period pieces and WWII stuff.t the bad guys truly are bad in this novel.<br />Politics aside, this story was interesting yet I found much of the dialogue between characters both childish and stating the obvious.

B000089RVX|5.0|I recommend Fallen to anyone who enjoys rock music. Evanescence brings a new sound to the rock scene. Their song, Bring Me To Life, sounds a little like something from Linkin Park, it's awesome. Fallen has a dark, melodramatic sound that makes Evanescence a unique, industrial rock band. Honestly, I get the chills when I hear Amy's booming voice.<br />* I would've written a detailed review about each song, but I can see that dozens of others have and there's no need to write the exact same things.
0380799006|4.0|Authors Adele Faber & Elaine Mazlish has published books like Siblings Without Rivalry & How to Talk so kids will Listen & Listen so kids will Talk. However, my in-depth study on the psychology of childrens' minds reveal the facts that their attitudes are solely dependent on their circumstances and their upbringing levels at home & school. It's one thing sure any kid require is 'Love, patience & Self Esteem.'<br />Psychologists caution against casting children in specific roles: the quiet one, athletic one, smart one, clumsy one and even a negative type can provide harmful self image that a child may carry throughout his life. Sibling rivalry is a competition for the affection and attention of their parents. Two best known Bible stories deal with bitter feuds between brothers-The Cain and Abel and the rivalry of Joseph and hisbrothers.Even in fairy tales - in 112 of the Grimm's' fairy tales, it is found that the youngest child came out a winner in battles with everything from evil gnomes to jealous siblings 92 percent of the times.<br />Psychologists authors of `Siblings without Rivalry' suggest that instead of thinking of equality in everything from parental attention to music lessons, parents should be sensitive to each child's individual needs.Self esteem of a child plays a major role. Comparisons should be avoided as each child is born with a difference. The authors have very valuable tips telling parents to adopt various methods and outcome with cartoons illustrating key points. The book reflects on the inner instincts of kids like jealousy and selfishness. Parents need to be aware of their attitude which become homegrown sibling rivalry. Communication is also important part that a parent miss out and impatiently tackles the sibling rivalry which only worsens things. Demonstrating love is very important and telling the child that he is so special. \\"I enjoy your friendship' or `I can always count on your support' or `You make me feents with + 2 & above kids.
0385486804|1.0|Into the Wild by John Kraukauer is a high and low book. When the book starts out it seems promising. It takes you through all the things that the boy, Chris McCandless went through on his journey to Alaska. As the book goes on it starts to get more and more boring. Then around page 100 or so the book starts to look up again and you want to continue reading. Then once you get through those pages and into pages 150 till the end, it seems as though the book drags on and on. It seems as if the authour just needed to fill some pages because he kept on writing. There are stories in the book that have nothing to do with the whole purpose of the book and you begin to feel as if the book should have never been published. Now although I am on 15 and having read the book for my high school, I think that other teens my age would find the book boring and worthless. I mean how many times can you explain how he met all the people he did. And how many times can you beat it into a persons head that he didnt like his family life. I mean once or twice is okay but when the book carries on about that you tend to get bored more easily. And also those other stories in the book, some of them are necceasary because they give you ideas on why he did what he did but when you have 2 whole chapters on someones story whose only parrallel is the father then you get bored too. That story should have been 10 pages tops not 25 or how ever long it was.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Being a total Romantic, I fell in love with the movie the first time I saw the previews.  I did not get to see it until just recently, tho, but once I did, I was over the top.  I am beginning a collection of movie and music items, as well as bookmarking sites wherever I can find them.  I have totally fallen in love with this soundtrack.  My only disappointment is that none of the versions contain all the music from the movie. I do prefer Volume 1 to Volume 2.  This version seems to be easier to listen to.  Volume 2 has a brash sound to it.  The fact that the songs were for the most part previously recorded music was an added attraction for me.  I love to sing along with Satine, Christian, and the rest of the characters, enjoying both the story line and the artists who make it come alive. To listen to this CD is to relive the movie.  I see the expressions on the faces of the different characters as they sing, and I am right there with them, sharing their sorrows and their joys as they move thru this brief moment in time.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Sam Raimi Brings all the energy and excitement from His Hercules and Xena TV shows to the movie adaptation of Spider-Man. This bright, energetic film stays true to the spirit of the comics. The story is easy to follow and is full of fun campy moments that will have you laughing, and on the edge of your seat with the action packed scenes that were ripped from a comic book. Fanboys may grumble that some things are modified (Organic webshooters, Mary Jane is in Gwen Stacy's place during the final battle) but these minor cosmetic changes only improve the story. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as does the rest of the cast. (Fans of Raimi films should Look for Lucy Lawless and Bruce Campbell in hilarous cameo roles.) This is a great film and it will get a lot of play on your DVD machine.
B00005JKZU|5.0|When I first saw the Two Towers in theater opening night, I was only half-way through the RotK book. Being a 13 year old, I was pretty happy I was going to finish the Hobbit and the LotR trilogy before the third movie ever produced its trailers.<br />The Two Towers was an excellent movie. Fast paced, energetic, tense at some parts. I too, have some complaints of some of the things that they left out of the movie, such as the Entmoot, and the fact that Haldir was at Helm's Deep, I don't remember that in the book. It was a great movie nonetheless, and thus I thought it was better than the first.<br />See, the first movie or book was like a platform, the pillars to construct a structure, introducing the characters, laying out the storyline, but where the Two Towers picked up, then it started getting action packed.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce took me back into the 70's with some of the songs on this album. She wrote sexy ballads and hot reggae joints. Her voice is on fire also, especially when she hits those high notes. I thought she would go into her upper register more, because the album could be a lot better, although it was good. My Favorites:<BR>1. Naughty Girl: A really sultry song, that took me back to the 70's with a version of Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\"<BR>2. Baby Boy: A reggae song featuring Sean Paul, who I love!<BR>3. Be With You: A sexy remake of George Clinton and Bootsie Collins 70's song. Really Sexy........<BR>4. Signs: With the help of Missy's flip it and reverse it, this ballad is great. I love It!!!!!!<BR>5. Speechless: The sexiest song on the album, you definitely can make some babies with this song.<BR>6. The Closer I Get To You: This remake of Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway's song, with Luther on it. Is as classic as the first.<BR>7. Daddy: This is a bonus track, but it is very special.<br />My Least Favorites:<BR>1. That's How You Like It: A song featuring Jay-Z. It doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. Really wack....<BR>2. Gift From Virgo: The beat is terrible and doesn't go good with the lyrics, take this off the album, and put \\"Summertime\\" on it. Anything but this terrible song.<br />The album is great, You should go buy it!!!!!!!!!
B00006IUL7|5.0|I would definitely have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this suspense/thriller/detective story.  \\"Insomnia\\" scores on all hits insofar as plot development, direction, acting and overall suspense.  I've watched a lot of Al Pacino's films over the years and I'd have to say that \\"Insomnia\\" is probably his best film in some time.  When you sit down to watch one of his films, you're usually guaranteed of one thing, Al Pacino in a movie with a different name, his portrayals are usually pretty similar.  This is not the case with \\"Insomnia,\\" which I believe is inherent to the fact that he had to play a famous detective from LA that is brought onto a case in Nightmute, Alaska and guess what, it daytime all day, and he's having a problem sleeping, due to both the all day daylight and a \\"slight\\" conscience problem.<br />Beyond Al Pacino's stellar performance in \\"Insomnia\\" there is Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, all three being Academy Award winners.  When one prepares to watch a film with Robin Williams in it, there is either going to be either humor that will take your breath away or an exceptional dramatic performance, which is what he delivers in \\"Insomnia.\\"  The ever beautiful Hilary Swank is right on with her performance as the somewhat \\"star struck\\" local detective, assigned to assist Al Pacino's character.<br />As a follow up to his directorial debut in \\"Memento,\\" director Christopher Nolan delivers brilliantly in \\"Insomnia\\" and his future films are to be looked forward to.<br />The premise:<br />LAPD Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is called in to investigate the murder of a local in Nightmute, Alaska.  Upon arrival and being met by Hilary Swank's character, he immediately views the remains of the murder victim, a young high school girl whose been beaten to death.  With the investigation started, he soon learns of the ever shining \\"midnight\\" sun during this time of year in Alaska and he soon learns of his partners intentions with reference to his affairs back in LA.  Take the already palpable tension between he and his partner, a stakeout where their hoping to catch the killer and fog off of a lake and here you have an exceptional psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Additional Scenes<BR>- Commentary by Director Christopher Nolan<BR>- Commentary by Hilary Swank, Production Designer Nathan Crowley, Editor Dody Dorn, Cinematographer Wally Pfister and Screenwriter Hillary Seitz<br />Featurettes:<BR>- Day for Night:  Making of Documentary<BR>- 180°:  A Conversation with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino<BR>- In the Fog:  Cinematography and Production Design<BR>- Eyes Wide Open:  The Insomniac's World<br />Additional special features:  Stills Gallery; Interactive Menus; Theatrical Trailer; Cast/Crew Film Highlights and Scene Access

0060916540|4.0|Joe Simpson's narrative of his infamous climb in the Peruvian Andes is a fantastic story.  If you've read other accounts of harrowing climbs you understand people that climb the great peaks of the world have a different psyche than the rest of us.  Simpson is no exception, and it is that very drive that takes him to the top that enables him to survive the unthinkable.  But this book is more than just a climb up, a crawl down, whew he's going to live to see another day.  It explores some deeper parts of the human experience such as friendship, devotion, suffering, inner strength, and fear.  His description of the terrain and the climb make you wonder why on earth anybody would do what he's doing.  You almost suffer the cold, wind, and frostbite and you can feel the ice slipping beneath your feet.  Knowing disaster looms makes you cringe while reading.  Although you know he will survive, that takes nothing away from the experience the second half of the book provides.  He pulls you in and you crawl down that icy mountain alongside him, feeling the cold, pain, and sadness along the way. Included are passages written by Simon Yates, his climbing partner.  Allowing us to experience his point of view adds depth to the story. <BR>Simpson wrote this book to exonerate Yates, who was ostracized in the British climbing community for his actions during the climb.  Simpson vehemently disagreed with anyone who believed Yates did anything short of saving his life.  His initial goal was to record the truth, but he discovered he has a gift for writing, and for this we can be grateful.  A compelling story, highly recommended.
B000069AUI|5.0|As many people probably were, I was a little skeptical when this came out.  Parachutes was (and still is) one of my all-time favorite CDs.  I had doubts whether the band would be able to improve upon what I already thought was damn close to perfect.  There is also that legendary &quot;sophomore slump&quot; that happens to many artists out there.  After hearing &quot;In My Place&quot;, I figured that this CD was worth the risk, even if it was slightly inferior to Parachutes.<br />Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  It took a couple listens for some of the songs to really sink in, but they definitely have... These songs are definitely slower and mellower than some of the stuff off of Parachutes, but make up for it in emotion, power, and intensity.  Chris Martin's voice, piano and guitars pretty much drive all of the songs, with the other members filling them in nicely.. especially the subtle but effective electric guitar work.<br />My favorite songs from here would be &quot;Politik&quot;, &quot;God Put A Smile On Your Face&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.  The only song I'm not totally thrilled with would be &quot;A Whisper&quot;, but it's still good enough to not take away from the 5 star rating, and what it lacks is more than made up for by the other tracks.<br />Basically, if you're looking for another &quot;Yellow&quot; (which is indeed and incredible song), you won't find it here... but if you really liked &quot;Spies&quot; or &quot;Trouble&quot; from Parachutes, you'll fall in love with this...
B00009V7T2|5.0|I think the title says it all, people.  I had totally given up on major label music until I heard this album.  These guys are progressive with a bit of a punk and metal edge.  It is kind of like listening to Rush with a soul.  If you like Pink Floyd, ELP, Yes, King Crimson, Radiohead, et al, then you need this album.  I've had it for two weeks now, and haven't been able to let myself listen to anything else.  Yes, it is that good.
B00005JLTN|2.0|This movie suffers from \\"sequelitys\\".<br />The story is complicated (the story of the first was also complicated) but that is not a problem, the problems are the following:<br />1- The sex scene (almost 10 minutes wasted!)<BR>2- The dance/orgy scene in Zion<BR>3- The excesive use of CGI for some secuences (i prefer the Wire-Fu used in the first movie)<BR>4- Did I mention the sex scene??<br />The plot is so-so... the story of the first was much better... i will buy this DVD only if (and just if) \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" is almost as good as the first
B000089RVX|5.0|Genius, absolute. Restored my faith in music. Not one filler on it.Its makes u cry(My Immortal), it makes u rock(Haunted).If you don't like this, you are already dead.This girl must have sold her soul to the devil for this voice.<BR>Will take you places you didn't know existed.<BR>Nuff said.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Gosford Park is pure fun.  This is the best written movie that I have seen in a long time.  One, you have to watch it twice to get it completely.  Two, the second viewing is even better than the first because of all the fine details.  Three, the commentary by writer Julian Fellows is outstanding and make the film (even) better.<br />I've read that some people think that this film is boring.  Who can possibly be bored with lines like, &quot;you always complain that people look down on you, but you insist on acting like a peasant&quot;?  Wonderful dialog. Or, the outstanding acting, 'the last scene between Ms. Wilson and Ms. Croft'. One cannot have a short attention span for a film like this because it is literally a fine wine that must be savored, not once, but three viewings.  <br />A good dvd transfer and a must disc for your collection.
B000002JS6|5.0|Everybody knows that this was AC/DC's first album after the death of Bon Scott. And by now the majority of people have heard at least one song of this album. But what they may not know, is how great it actually is, from the ringing of the bells to 'Preacher Brian Johnson', this album is classic in every sense of the word.<br />By going with what they knew best (and, of course, Angus' 6-string) they just wanted to make something to honor their former member. And I think Bon is proud of them for making it.<br />No matter what you have to do, some point in your life, listen to this album in its entirety, not just one song, but let the whole thing just go...
B00003CXCW|5.0|I watch this film for one reason - Gloria Swanson's outstanding performance as Norma Desmond.  However, the more I watch this film the more Holden's character bother me.  The audience hears his scathing thoughts through voice-over in his assessement of the people (The Waxworks) he is around and the world in which he lives.  <br />It has been stated that this film shows how dark and demented Hollywood is through the character of Norma Desmond.  I thought Norma was the sanest person in the film, until the end that is.  She knows her world and pulls all it's strings with the hand of a virtuoso. <br />Even before Holden meets Norma we see that he is no more than a Hollywood hustler, whether he admits it to himself or not.  He doesn't pay his bills, he hustles bad scripts, begs for loans and eventually loses his car.  Oh, did I forget to mention that he considered taking his good friend's girl?  Arrogantly this character still believes that he is better than Norma because, well, he's young - another underlying theme.<br />Maybe this film holds up so well because we know that on Sunset Boulevard there are no saints. Holden is not virtuous, Norma isn't 'that' creepy by Hollywood's standards and there is no such thing as dreams without a price.<br />The transfer of this disc is simply outstanding and the supplements are well done.  This is indeed a collector's edition.
B00006RU5B|3.0|While I am a big fan of Rage, and a casual fan of Soundgarden (so I do not hate either band, keep that in mind), this album wasn't bad by any standards, it's just that the biggest turnoff for me was the vocals (especially in Like A Stone, which features some of Tom's best guitar work), the vocals just sounded like mumbling most of the time, which they may very well have been. But, in any case, if you linger for the glory days of Rage to return with this album, you may be slightly disappointed, as I cannot seem to get past Track 8. But, you may have a different 'feel' for this album, so just go with whatever you want.<br />(I'm so helpful)

B00005JLXE|4.0|I saw Daredevil in the theaters and I must say it was very different then the other Marvel movies that I have seen, such as X-Men, X2:X-Men United, and Spider-Man. This movie was much darker and had a more serious story than the preveous Marvel Comic Movies. Ben Affleck plays the role of Matt Murdock/Darevil very well, much better than I expected. Jennifer Garnner plays a very good Elektra. She portrays the comic book charactor very well. Overall there isn't that much bad acting in the film, which makes me wounder why it didn't do well in the Box Office. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are not as good as they sound. I was very disappointed with that part of the DVD. <BR>Overall: This would be better for a weekend rental rather than buying it.
630522577X|4.0|This musical is brilliant in the telling of the original George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion.<BR>This is Sir Rex Harrisons movie and although this is usually referred to as an \\"Audrey Hepburn picture\\" i don't believe her performance was of the standard of Rex's, in fact quite inferier to Rex's i thought, although i do love her and think she is the third most gorgous woman in the world (first being Vivien Leigh, and second being Julie Andrews) her performance in this movie was rather plain and although she looked ravashing in her ball gowns, this really was Julie Andrews's role and it was a little naughty of her to pinch it.  The dubbing is disgraceful as Audreys mouth doesn't match Marni Nixons voice hardly and when they are meant to be celebrating Eliza's new upper class accent we only got a few seconds of Audreys voice change before Marni jumps in with a rather pathetic and limp version of \\"The Rain In Spain.\\"With this DVD you hear Audreys voice for the first time on its own singing Wouldn't it be loverly and Show me. She sounds like a frghtened horse!<BR>I suggest you by this DVD to see Rex take over your screen as <BR>the big headed, selfish, arrogant and cool Henry Higgins.  The relationship with his mother is funny.Also if you like the songs DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT buy the film soundtrack unless you want to hear Marni Nixon wailing through these classic numbers and Rex Harrisons modified Henry Higgins numbers, buy the original broadway production, or to you and me the Julie Andrews one as not only do the songs sound show stopping performed by Ms. Andrews and also i find that her numbers sound strong and powerful compared to the movies versions but Rex Harrisons voice is alot more louder and clearer and mutch better as he seems to get Henry down to a \\"cup, then say of, then say cup cup cup cup cup cup of of of of TEA!\\"
0380002930|5.0|J.B. Emert<br />Watership Down<br /> What I liked about Watership Down is that it is very exciting how Fiver can tell things are going to happen. He can tell if something bad is coming and there are a lot of bad and weird things in this book that he tells to you and explains what is going to happen. For instance, he knows that Hazel Rah is going to get hurt. He tells Hazel and even though Hazel knows, that night when they are going out to get does, somehow Hazel gets shot. That is one of my favorite parts in the book even though it is sad. Also one of the best and funniest parts in the book is when they find Keehar, the bird and Bigwig becomes friends with him. Also when they help Keehar and give him shelter for the night. Then after his pulled muscle gets better he goes out and flies for them. What this means is he goes out in the day time and looks for does which are female rabbits. They need females to start a colony. Kehaar does not come back for several days and they started to worry, but he did come back eventually. <br /> This book is way different in a lot of ways and the same too. It is different because they are rabbits and find out something bad it going to happen to the warren. They flee and go to someplace better. It is the same because all the books are dealing with someone or something living and have to try and stay away from their enemy. It is also different with Watership Down and a wrinkle in time because in a wrinkle in time they try to save their dad who disappeared and went back in time. They go after him and find a wrinkle in the earth to take them back in time. They find him and come back safely. In Watership Down they try to save themselves from getting killed instead of their family. They go through hardships as well and finally reach their destination and are safe. <br /> I would recommend this book to other people because it is very exciting and has meaning. You also get to feel for the rabbits and feel sorry for them because they get hurt. Especially, when Hazel Rah gets shot and just about dies. That is probably the most emotional part of the book, but it also makes the book a lot better. I like it and I hope others will too.
B00004R9A4|5.0|This is a lovely film and although it is compared alot to Mary Poppins, i believe these are the creme de la creme of childrens films.  This tale is set in the country during the war. At first we are welcomed into the movie with some rather boring local old folk, but then we hear the wonderful sounds of banging in the distance and yellow smoke, it's Eglantine Eglantine is there and this woman is no ordinary woman she is a, witch, All gasp!And then they go on all the outings that bring back happy memories of Mary Poppins.  This movie has alot of connections with Mary Poppins, for example, Robert Stevenson, Irwin Kostal, the Sherman Brothers, David Tomlinson (George Banks in Mary Poppins) and Reginald Owen (Admiral Boom in Mary Poppins)you no the old soldier at the beginnig of the movie and the the leader in the spirited march at the end. I do not believe that Mary Poppins is better than Bedknobs And Broomsticks, neither viser vurser as they are very similar with lovable, exciting and realistic characters.  That can not be said however about another &quot;similar&quot; (well thats what most people think, I do not agree!) picture named Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!

Mary Tyler Moore, i found was rather anoying at first but then i fell in love with her. Carol Channing is simply bonkers, thats the only word i can describe Muzzy with and John Gavin is brilliant as Trevor Graydon, and i found it hysterically funny when he started to refer to Millie as &quot;John&quot; but the funniest thing was, i thought it rather suited her!!!!<br />Altogether this is just Fun Fun Fun and if you want a little chuckle then by this wonderful movie.

My vinyl side A hisses and pops from decades of passionate attention, side B is almost a stranger. <BR>&quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; is self-assured and powerful, the music driving the words back to the Procol Harum of the Whiter Shade, the white in the black, light in the darkness, truth in the (then, not today, of course) non-truths, the sloppy pervasive irresponsibilty of trendy lyrics. <BR>&quot;Strong as Samson&quot; majestic, soaring, seering and haunting,like Whiter Shade,Homburg and Wee Small Hours, at the very heart and soul of why Brooker and Reid et al sat down to write a song.<BR>As the side finishes, and Just Another Idol fades away, musical bliss has set in, and who needs to turn over the record?...of course, if it's a CD, well, enjoy it all, the world of Exotic Birds and Fruits, incredible keyboards, slick guitar, tight rhythm work, and lyrics to long linger over.
B00004R99M|5.0|I love the way she introduces herself and i love her confidence.She will not be dominated by anyone and in this magical story Mary Poppins is the greatest childrens character ever.<BR>Dame Julie Andrews IS Mary Poppins, and i thinks its marvellous how Mary runs rings round the stubburn Mr Banks.<BR>What i was surprised to hear was that when P.L.Travers (the author of the Mary Poppins Book) viewed Ms. Andrews performance she classed it \\"satisfactory.\\" Don't you have eyes you stupid woman! Without Julie's outstanding performance, your character would be boring, nasty and ugly like she was in your books. Although i have to agree with her on Dick Van Dykes performance as she wanted to re cast the character of Bert as she thouht he was nothing like her Bert in her books, she's right. <BR>But really, this movie is a CLASSIC and has hardly any faults.  Though did you know that Glynis Johns (Mrs Banks) first thought Walt Disney was to cast her as Mary Poppins and when he told her that was already cast to THE Julie Andrews, she was angry and so only agreed to do the picture if she had a song as she felt Julie Andrews was taking all the songs in the picture, well theres only one thing to say to that and that is JULIE CAN SING, YOU CAN'T!!!!<BR>The DVD has a wonderful little extra of the actual premiere of Mary Poppins which i found very interesting and also gives you a little featurette on the actual special effects. The picture is crisp and clear and the colour is vivid.<BR>So Spit Spot! Buy this DVD to keep Mary Poppins looking \\"practically perfect in every way\\" forever!
B000063DGC|5.0|I think this is one of the greatest live CDs ever recorded. Unlike some of Ozzy's later live albums, his voice still sounds freash. This is the only live CD I am aware of that has the late, the great, Randy Rhoads on it. His improvements on the Blizzered of Ozz songs and the Diary of a Madman songs are brillient. The Black Sabbath covers show that Randy Rhoads can reproduce, and greatly improve Tony Iommi's songs. This CD holds the best recordings of, Paraniod, Crazy Train, I Don't Know, Sucide Sulotion, Dee, and Mr. Crowly. This was my first Ozzy CD, and I feel that it was a great place to start.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Inspired by his newfound grasp on \\"The Truth,\\" which is basically anything he personally believes, Prince released The Rainbow Children as a sort of \\"concept album.\\"  But the album is so bogged down in religious babbble, misogyny, and racist undertones, that even the impressive playing on the record suffers.  The album opens with Prince's voice processed so he sounds like a constipated Darth Vader.  Along the way you hear \\"thought provoking\\" lyrics like \\"Holocaust aside, many lived and died, but when all truth is told would you rather be dead or be sold?\\"  6 million Jews who lost their lives in World War II would probably have an opinion on the tragedy that Prince so callously dismisses.  He later cites Thomas Jefferson as a racist slave owner, and blames white people for a host of problems, ignoring the fact that many black people sold their own brothers and sisters and sons and daughters into slavery.  His inclusion of the uplifting soundclip \\"free at last\\" is an insult to Dr. King's message and memory.  But the fun doesn't end there - other songs include Prince's thoughts on how women should be under the rule of men who are under the rule of God, and other really modern ways of thinking.  1+1+1 is 3 is a poor cousin of the classic Erotic City.  His 1980s music was so enjoyable and all inclusive, but this \\"rainbow\\" is clearly one meant for select colors.  Prince, a preacher and prophet, you are not.
B000067J1H|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. It goes away from the book occasonally, but it is still great. The sceans in the movie that weren't in the book are brillient. The screen writer mush have had a huge understanding of the meaning of the book. The acting was terriffic, Brat Pitt and Edword Noten did a great job. This is a great movie and should be watched by everybody at least once (but you'll want to watch it again, trust me).
068981528X|5.0|I read this to my 3 year old son after I read the Story of the Three Little Pigs (Bishop) and the True Story of the Three Little Pigs.  This was by far the best.  The story uses the classic lines of \\"Let me come in!\\" and \\"Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chins.\\" The 3 Little Wolves  begin by building their house of bricks, but the Big Bad Pig knocks it down with a hammer.  The 3 Wolves continue to build their houses of concrete, and steel plates, only to have them destroyed by the Pig.  In the end, it has a happy resolution as the wolves build their house of flowers, and the Pig becomes a Big Good Pig after smelling the flowers.  The wolves and the pig sit down together to enjoy tea and live happily ever after.
B000050FEN|5.0|This is a terriffic movie. The end was like no end to a movie I have ever seen. I could not wait to see how Kevin Spacy would punish his next &quot;sinner&quot;. Mogen Freeman, like all his other movies, was terriffic. Brad Pitt also played one hell of a cop. In short all the actors where great. The dircting was also terriffic.
B00005QG9J|1.0|The only good song on this CD is Circles.  Every other song blows.  If you want some good Incubus, listen to their earlier CDs
B00005AW41|5.0|Daft Punk's Discovery album is extremely balanced in that it is half instrumental and half vocalized. Each song has quite a different atmosphere and thus offers something for every mood. Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is easily the best known song on Discovery, and also the best to dance to. It offers the variety of tones and sounds that One More Time lacks, but One More Time still manages to hold its own. Face To Face offers a slightly less electronic sound than the rest of the album. Too Long contains a very mellow beat, with some wholesome lyrics. Aerodynamic is in my opinion the best instrumental song on the album, with such a wide array of sounds and distortions. Superheroes features a very nice retro beat. Crescendolls has a very futuristic sound and beat, and it holds your attention. Digital Love is somewhat like One More Time, only less repetitive and it has a very happy tune. Short Circuit offers a very cool compilation of futuristic sounds and it progresses very well. High Life is a lot different from the other songs, but is similar to Face To Face in its feel and rhythm. Something About Us offers a well balanced mix of instrumental and vocalized beats. Veridis Quo has a very aged sound to it, and is very appealing to the ears. Not really danceable, but great none the less. Night Vision features sort of an eerie beat and is very fitting of its title. Voyager features a soft sound and atmosphere, and yet a faster paced beat than Something About Us. All in all, for such a well-balanced album, I give Discovery 5 stars. It is a great choice for newcomers, and old fans will be pleasantly surprised.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This album is very well done.  Tom morello goes back to the sound that he had in the first Rage Against the Machine CD.  I use to be a huge RAGE fan.  I stopped liking them because they began to really [get bad].  I think that this CD totally redeems my faith that (atleast) some of the RAGE members can still make an awesome CD.  I like this CD a lot.  I would definetely recommend it.  It's one of the best recent rock albums!  It sounds awesome!
B00008D1NF|4.0|When I first heard Tribalistsas' cut \\"Carnavalia\\" on the radio, I wanted to hear more. So I bought the CD and now listen to it frequently. Another favorite is the catchy \\"Passe Em Casa,\\" from guest artist Margareth Menezes. This CD does supposedly represent the best of Brazilian pop, and features three of Brazil's hottest stars: Arnaldo Antunes' vocals, Marisa Monte's guitar, and Carlinhos Brown on the piano, bass, and vocals. The trio does create an unbelievable rich, gentle, and subtle melange of vocals and instrumentation; the percussion is wonderful.<br />Tribalistas combined efforts bring the terrific contemporary music of Brazil to life. This is mellow sound that encourages you to chill-out, and dream.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton has assembled another solid thriller, based on latest technology, in this case, nanotechnology gone wild.  Jack is a recently fired software executive whose overambitious wife ends up running a division of a nanotechnology firm where things are clearly not quite right. <br />Ultimately, Jack is hired by his wife's firm, to resolve some minor coding issues, as his previous firm sold the code to his wife's firm. Actually, the problem is that rapidly evolving and learning swarms have been haphazardly released into the isolated environment of a Nevada test facility. The original concept was that the swarm would provide military surveillance capability without any possibility of detection or destruction.  A related medical application was developed, whereby the swarm would invade one's body instead of x-rays and MRI's. <br />Jack's wife's firm clearly has no idea how to solve the problem and in fact, makes the situation much worse. <br />Now to my criticisms. First, the book is written in first person and the dialogue is rather tedious, with the children's petty arguments and stupid remarks for some reason playing an important role.  Secondly, the latter half of the book, with Jack on location in Nevada leading the charge against the swarm, is almost a slap-stick escapade. Things really get nuts when the swarm learns to mimic humans and even infects them without Jack's knowledge. The science and technology and warnings on the use are excellent and timely, but the action sequences could be from an Abbott and Costello movie. <br />Take this book to the beach.  Light reading with a heavy message and some wacky adventures.
B00008IXAR|5.0|Like most of the other reviewers here, I have been absolutely<BR>enthralled by this latest album from Simply Red.<br />Mick and the \\"band\\" have combined their unique talents once<BR>again and put together an album that crosses R&B, pop, jazz,<BR>and funk genres - into territory that belongs solely to<BR>Simply Red.<br />\\"Home,\\" \\"Fake,\\" and \\"Sunrise\\" start off this album superbly.<BR>As I write this review, I am listening to the silky smooth<BR>\\"Sunrise,\\" my favorite track on the CD.  Without giving away too<BR>much, I didn't think anyone could improve classic Hall & Oates...<BR>but Mick and company definitely have!<br />This CD will be a hidden gem for U.S. purchasers, who will<BR>probably not hear much from \\"Home\\" on the air.
0066620996|5.0|In my search for seeking mastery in my life, my expectations about \\"Good to Great\\" were not fulfilled until I read the last page at the end of the book. The 'smoking gun back at my face' was how it converged so well with the comments given on the first page at the beginning of the book! Here it is:<br /><br />In our personal and professional lives, there are an abundance of activities that we, as individuals, can accomplish that go far beyond settling for just a good life. Preferably, a meaningful life can be spectacular, even under the worse set of conditions, as long as one has 'a hand in creating something of intrinsic excellence that makes a contribution' to life. FABULOUS!<br /><br />This book reflects the extensive and timely research done over the period of ten years. Luckily, I read this book first. It is the 'prequel' to \\"Built to Last,\\" written earlier. Jim Collins did his best to gather and report his data in empirical form, but remember the precision of how the statistics were collected and determined. This is just a subjective test. A defensive football coach may know that the other team passes on the fourth down, only 2 yards to go for the goal line, 85% of the time, and may still lose the game against the same team every year.<br /><br />Applying a different perspective (and please don't send me back to grade school), let's play in my sand box:<br /><br />1) The book finally settled on 11 finalists that survived all the rigorous filters and tests. Does that mean that the rest of the companies, including Microsoft, failed? Hardly! What about all the companies that did not attract enough notice from the media and public scrutiny? On another note. Jim Collins has become part of the 'enlightened establishment.' Incredibly intelligent and talented people surround him. His dynamo wife is a truly phenomenal woman. Even Jim Collins admits 'she had the genetics!' BAM! That is your reality and what an excellent life (WooHOO)! What about the rest of us lower mortals?<br /><br />2) It is unrealistic to get a 'partnership made in heaven' for the 'WHO, then WHAT' by getting the right people on the bus. Granted, matches like HP occur, and love at first sight is common. But, like marriages, most do not endure the test of time. However, consider expanding upon the analogy illustrated in the book.<br /><br />If the clean bus has a clearly marked sign indicated where it is going and even has a high-tech-electronically lit neon sign to flash alternate messages that indicate the street it is taking to get there (and the bus is marked with the name of the driver delicately stenciled next to the door along with a polished and attractive state-of-the-art coin machine to take and dispense the correct change), this is the strategy and vision of the bus driver (leader). The messages, signals and a few rules are clear to the person before jumping on the bus. This person can also get off the bus at the next stop. Only at this point is it prudent to select the right people to stay on the bus and to arrange them to sit at the right seat until the last stop to the beach for the sunset party.<br /><br />3) It is unrealistic to recruit enough Level 5 leaders into positions of power. They are simply overlooked. The Board and investors who deliberately pick the 'Celebrity Hogs' rarely consider them. I truly wish we had more Abraham Lincoln's!<br /><br />4) Technology should appear at the beginning of the entire process along with strategy. It must not be fully deployed because the needs are not completely known. However, it must be available at all times, at each process to accellerate the value of the company.<br /><br />This is an excellent book. It answers many difficult questions. It provides superb analytical thought and does a fantastic job reporting startling results. This is not a fad book. It should be required reading for all entrepreneurs who wish to shape the future and improve the quality of work in our lives.get a 'partnership made in heaven' for the 'WHO, then WHAT' by getting the right people on the bus.

B00005JLSE|5.0|The movie is absolutely brilliant. Those who would be hesitant to see a cheesy musical where the actors just bust out into song for no good reason will be pleasantly surprised. <br />The storyline is a scathing commentary on the American media, and the way it tends to sensationalize the wicked to the point that the criminals become stars themselves. Anyone who tells you it glorifies crime simply doesn't get it. It is a satirical look at the lengths some will go to for fame and fortune, and how we as a society reward notoriety.<br />The film also skewers the law profession and the fact that reality plays little part in the court room as long as you have the press and public opinion on your side. The crimes of the Renee and Catherine characters are undermined in a sea of headline-grabbing reporters and manipulating lawyers. It is a peek into how society suffers at the hands of spin doctors. It shows how in the legal process/media frenzy, the crime and the victim are secondary to the commerce of selling papers or building a booming law practice. Good stuff.<br />The music is thrilling, and the perfomances are top-notch. The number where Richard Gere is a puppetmaster to the press and his client Renee Zellweger is worth the price alone.
0441172717|4.0|Dune is a great book, the problem however is with this edition. There are several obvious spelling errors, and at least twice i've seen whole lines repeated twice in a row. Try a different editon.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Good story even if it isn't historically accurate as some would like.  Hey, it's not a documentary, it's entertainment.  Lots of action and the special effects are awesome.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|This CD is the first audio cd i have paid for in quite some time... i'm very fond of Ambient Techno (and some other forms when i'm in the mood) and Classical music... well as Ambient techno goes this is rather good... one of my favorites.... (i do know some of it is not &quot;PURE&quot; ambient, thats why i gave 4 stars)
B00003CX5P|2.0|Too much kidstuff.  Lucas lost his edge with this one.  Special effects are cool, but a little too much for me.  Jar-Jar was annoying, the kid is annoying, the race scene was cheesy.  I could go on, but I won't.
B00005UKKF|5.0|OMG, I love Britney Spears anyways.  I think she has an awesome personality and can break it down like James Brown any day but I really didn't know what to expect from her concert.  I thought maybe a bit to bubble gummy but in all actuality it was one hell of a performance after another.  She looks great, sounds great and gives the audience tons of visuals.  I will always support her over any other younger pop diva out there and all I have to say is watching this concert, it only made me realize that there is so much more to come.  I wasn't disappointed in the least, in fact her very last song on here is phenomenal.  I mean she takes it to another level.  If only she would come out with a remix album that would be hot!  Buy this you won't be disappointed, I have to say I have watched it religeously almost every weekend since purchasing it.  BRITNEY FOREVER!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Anyone who has posted that DITC is anything like what ATDI ever did either has not listened to this album carefully, or knows nothing about ATDI. It is undeniable that you hear the influences of Rush, Zeppelin, Santana and Floyd throughout this album (which was never true with ATDI), but then taken to a level of madness that is undeniably Omar and Cedric. I have never heard Cedric sing as melodiously as he does here, and Omar's guitar work is as inventive and creative as ever, with the seemingly random-yet-fitting notes and licks he is so well known for. The mania that is so persistent in this album fits with its theme, and the story (and the man) behind it. It is a roller coaster ride of emotions that I certainly could do no justice with words explaining. It is, quite simply, an experience. Undoubtedly the best album of this millenium, by FAR better than anything i have heard from ATDI (and ATDI is amazing). Get it. Now.
B000084T18|2.0|All right, I will make this short and sweet. 50 cent as an artist is terrible. He is completely monotone and can anybody really understand what he is trying to say half the time. I'de be better off trying to figure out what Ozzy is saying. The only thing that truly saves this album from complete destruction is the fact that 50 has 2 rap moguls producing his album. Thank god he has Dre and Em producing his album cuz if it werent for them this album wouldnt have sold a tenth of what it sold. I'de even come as far to say that I have lost some respect for Dre for even thinking of working on such a terrible project. I just have to say that if 50 is the future of rap than were all in trouble cuz rap used to be poetic like 2pac or Nas and now its just pop like Justin or Britney. All in all 50 cent's is about the amount i'de pay for this hip hop massacre.
0767817664|5.0|I am now 20 and I saw this movie when I was pretty young. Whenever I went to visit my cousin, she would play the part of Amy coming down the stairs saying &quot;What's the matter, Charlie? Don't you WANT me anymore???&quot; And I would always be the sympathetic guy Charlie... This movie has always been one of my faves.. I'm a big fan of the vampire movies anyways, liking 'The Lost Boys', 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (the tv show), 'Angel', 'Interview With a Vampire', etc... But this movie is not only horror, but it also has a great mix of comedy in it. When I saw the movie &quot;Vamp&quot;, it was clear that both movies were trying to pull off the whole scary/funny thing but only &quot;Fright Night&quot; truly got it right. I highly recommend this movie!
B000002J20|5.0|what can i say, this is yes's epic album like genesis's &quot;lamb lies down on broadway&quot;,<BR>truly a breath taking album, each time i listen to it it reminds<BR>me why i love music so much. but note this before listening to it(!): it takes a long time untill you really understand this album and feel the magic of it, listen to it for a few times before you judge anything about this amazing album..i recommand listening to other Yes albums before getting into this one<BR>to get to know the band's sound and approach to music.
B00005JLKB|5.0|First of all, I don't watch that much tv or tv shows in particular, but there is one show I religiously follow: Smallville.  I have been hooked since the first pilot aired and the show still continues to amaze me.  The writing, direction and cast are all top-notch.  Smallville is one of those rare treasures on television that doesn't come along often.  It's unique blend and take on the young Superman legend is fresh and exciting, always holding your attention, pulling you in and charming you with its magic spell.  <br />Smallville's main strength is in its character development, without a doubt.  The view knows exactly who these characters are, inside and out, and you have to give a lot of credit to the writers--they have done a remarkable job of developing Clark and Lana's relationship and making us crave for more, at the same time, always adding some new twists along the way.  I love looking at Kristin Kreuk; she has an amazing, beautiful face that everyone has fallen in love with! Luckily, all the other characters are interesting as well, have prominent roles to play and everybody is connected to each other in one way or another.  One of the things I absolutely love about Smallville is the dialogue; it's never corny or stupid like all the other shows.  I listen to what the characters say and I'm always impressed by the dialogue and how sophisticated it is. I would say Michael Rosenbaum playing Lex Luthor always delivers the best lines; it's concise, powerful, eloquent and razor-sharp.  In fact, every episode feels like watching a big-screen movie with all the various elements of the show coming together perfectly.   Simply put, Smallville is an outstanding, extremely appealing and expertly crafted show.  I hope they come out with the second season DVD soon!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I am someone who has perhaps two soundtracks in my CD collection. But I loved the movie( as did my kids and wife ) so I went out to purchase the soundtrack. It was sold out at B &amp; N and Borders so I ended up going across town to a small independent store and it was worth the trip. An excellent soundtrack that is making its way from my car to the kids rooms to the office.I love the fact that you can almost see the action thru the interaction of the strings. My only drawback is that its only 43 minutes long.How about it Klaus &quot; Bowsprit &quot; Badelt and Han &quot; Long John &quot; Zimmer, how about some more.  May be some outtakes?
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Who could ask for more:  An eerie hamonica playing, lightning fast shoot, enigmatic and Hawk-eyed Charles Bronson as the mysterious Westerner.  Henry Fonda as the ruthless, evil, and conniving epitomy of the western bad guy.  Jason Robards as the gang leader of the duster-clad Cheyenne gang.  And Claudia Cardinale as the bodacious, luscious, temptress who came to the West to find a new life only to arrive and have her world turned upside down.  All of the stars hover around Claudia, while the cripple \\"Mr. Choo-Choo\\" moves ever closer to completing the American transcontinental railroad.  While the main theme is interwoven around these characters, there is more than meets the eye as Sergio weaves us through Western landscapes, scenery, seedy towns and Western myth to bring us a compelling and thoroughly watchable western epic.  I found all of his spaghetti westerns fun to watch but this one really jumped out and hooked me.  This is my pick for the best Western of all time (and just FYI - I rank Lonesome Dove as #2 but the book is MUCH better).  Watch this move and enjoy it.  I am sure it will get into your blood as well.   ...//Bobb
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am literally in disbelief over the 1 star reviews of people being mad about this movie's depiction of violence. Are you KIDDING me? 'Chicago' was actually written decades ago, and this movie (as well as the version currently on Broadway) is technically actually a revival. The entire musical, while fun with great music and dancing, has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and is really about America's fascination with the rich, glam and famous and also the fickle power of clebrity and the \\"here today, gone tomorrow\\" phonemoea of Hollywood and the American media. But it sure is a fun fable! And while all of the actors are wonderful, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere dance away with the movie! I saw it 5 times and can't wait to own it, enjoy!
0440237688|5.0|Can it really be nine years since I first read The Giver?  Even now this book still resounds with me.  Some of it has to do with the very open-endedness that has so unnerved some revieweres.  The reader begins with fascination at the perfectly-ordered community, which transforms into revulsion.  This is a book that rather than simply presenting straightforward answers, is more an invitation to introspection and debate.  <br />Take one single scene, for instance--the one where Jonas' father \\"releases\\" the newborn twin.  It is clear that he's bothered by that side of his job--he even makes somewhat of an effort to try and spare Gabriel that same fate, yet he does nothing to stop the release of the twin.  Even when it is Gabriel's term, he relents to the will of the community.  But in his society, would it even have been possible for him to develop a rebellious mindset, after having been controlled to a degree not even the Communists could accomplish?  This makes one wonder--is Jonas' father a good man in spite of what his society has indoctrinated him to do?  Aristotle suggested that a person who lived in an eternal coma (which the state of Sameness could be considered) could not be virtuous, because his or her virtue has never been tested.  So can there even be a such thing as a good or evil person in a society where there is no true freedom of thought or choice?<br />I must admit, I find one reviewer's dismissal of the book simply because certain scenes such as the release of the newborn twin \\"did not agree with [their] beliefs\\" rather narrowminded--if not a demonstration of the very attitude that created the hell of Sameness.  Is that scene repugnant?  Absolutely, and that is the intention.  The whole point of that scene is to show the horrible price society and the individual pay for conformity.  I do not think children should be shielded from this reality.<br />Although it leaves more questions than answers--this is not a bad thing.  For instance, it seems that clouding the history of how such a Sameness was accomplished adds to the \\"timeless\\" sense of the novel.  And many of the philosophical questions are well worth the mind-expanding debate.  All in all, this is an excellent book I would even recommend to adults.
B000094J66|5.0|This latest version of Four Feathers hits squarely on what soldiers in combat really fight for. It's not love of country or blind devotion to duty. In the end, as eloquently stated by a character who has lost his sight in battle, &quot;You fight for the man on your right. You fight for the man on your left.&quot; Above all, this film defines personal honor and the meaning of friendship in the crucible of war and survival. As a movie, it's not perfect. It drags in spots. The Director has some ambivalence about embracing British Colonialism. At times it parallels our incursion into Iraq. The only difference is that we're in camouflage khaki instead of the Queen's Scarlet. Heath Ledger is excellent as the young Brit trying to find himself. His intensity outshines the movie's flaws. The key battle scene is excellent. (Real English troops play the Redcoats) The action around the infantry square is historically accurate and chilling. It is an epic to friendship and personal growth.
B000089RVX|5.0|One of the newest bands to hit the music scene in recent months, EVANESCENCE, has been having a great run of luck with their singles out on radio stations all across the country and around the world! Their debut album, &quot;FALLEN&quot; is one of the most intriguing and indepth works of art that I've seen in quite a long time! The lyrics and music themselves are both haunting and strangely comforting to listen to all at the same time. Combine that with the incredible vocal talent of singer Amy Lee, and you have one sure fire method for success! This album is bound to surprise anyone who is a first time listener to the band and their music, and it is highly pleasureable for those who are already grounded fans.
B0000026J1|4.0|Quick, what's Swedish for &quot;shimmering synths&quot;, as termed by my colleague Eric Andrews, and &quot;Would you like a little guitar with your keyboards?&quot;  Yes, Ron Nevison produced Europe's followup to The Final Countdown, Out Of This World, and like albums of his other clients, most notably Heart's Bad Animals, the results were a more polished, keyboard heavy-sound that dampened the heavy guitars, but still made a worthy followup album.<br />The first single, &quot;Superstitious&quot;, deserved higher than its Top 40 placing in the singles chart.  The mixed keyboards and guitar becomes apparent here, with Joey Tempest's soaring vocals and new guitarist Kee Marcello's piercing guitar solo.  And those horn-like synths that made &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; a megahit are here.  The protagonist emphasizes reason as opposed to superstition as to why things happen, and affirms a positive life using that belief.<br />&quot;Let The Good Times Rock&quot;, well, the title speaks for itself.  The music is the usual melange of keyboard and guitar, which actually overrides the synths in places.<br />The next three songs are a block of outstanding tracks.  Europe resurrects the four-year old &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, originally on their Wings Of Tomorrow album, into a poignant power ballad with sad strings instead of a lightweight rocker.  The protagonist has sunken so much that &quot;I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door.&quot;  Marcello's snarling solo is then accompanied by the wall of synth.  &quot;Maybe that time has its own way of healing/Maybe it dries the tears in your eyes&quot; Tempest sings at one point.  Yeah, I hope it does.<br />Synths and drums dominate on the rocking &quot;More Than Meets The Eye&quot;, where a man is trying to cope with someone's who's left him.  When love dies, the chorus says, it's &quot;so much more than just a last goodbye/it's a cold and lonely heart/So sad and torn apart.&quot;<br />The string-laden power ballad &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; is a portrait of loneliness with that glimmer of hope in the end.  &quot;When time seems so lonely/And your day seems too long/You wonder if you will ever get through/And still be strong.&quot;  But, as the chorus says, &quot;Coast to coast and land to land/We're together hand in hand,&quot; i.e. you're not the only one who's alone.<br />&quot;Ready Or Not&quot; is the most engaging track.  &quot;Rock me like you've never done before/then rock me just a little more&quot; really describes the breakneck tempo done a la Pat Benatar's &quot;Heartbreaker.&quot;  And Marcello's guitar echoes Joe Satriani in spots.  He really does great justice to this album.<br />&quot;Sign Of The Times&quot; describes what defines our character:  &quot;It's the way that we makes things right/Its' the way that we hold on tight.&quot;  &quot;Just The Beginning&quot;, with its heavy hook-heavy keyboards, is an affirmation that one can face anything:  &quot;Come thunder, lightning all over me/I'd still be on my way.&quot;<br />&quot;Never Say Die&quot; is a mellower cousin of The Final Countdown's &quot;Rock The Night&quot;.  The chugging &quot;Lights And Shadows&quot; details the sudden appearance of an old flame who wants someone to hold.<br />&quot;Tower's Callin'&quot; about a pilot little knowing that he's going on his last flight.  One can imagine what happens, because this song doesn't tell us.  The closing teary piano and strings ballad &quot;Tomorrow&quot; asks a partner questions so-often asked.  &quot;Will you be there beside me/If the world falls apart/And will all of our moments/remain in your heart/.../And be there to hold me/Whenever I cry.&quot;  And so on.  Indeed, that'd be one of the questions I'd ask:  &quot;Will you be there tomorrow?&quot;<br />Out Of This World is a strong followup to The Final Countdown, but making Joey Tempest the sole writer on all songs except for &quot;Just The Beginning&quot; and &quot;Ready Or Not&quot; has resulted in less potent songs, plus some tracks barely escape filler status by strong and rhythmic synths and guitars.ed in less potent songs, plus some tracks barely escape filler status by strong and rhythmic synths and guitars.
0784011176|5.0|I just can´t believe that some people call this movie &quot;porn&quot; - GET A LIFE!!!<br />Though it sometimes has a low-budget feeling to it - probably because it is - this movie is heart-rending, and I´m usually not into this kind of thing.<br />A Scottish woman (Holly Hunter) stops speaking for no reason we ever get to know (nor where her precocious daughter [Anna Paquin] comes from), and is married off by her family to a New Zealand farmer (Sam Neill). After a tough journey she arrives in a strange land, and the only thing that matters to her besides her daughter is her piano, which allows her to express her feelings. But her woodheaded husband leaves it on the beach. <br />Their neighbour Baines, always suspicious for his good relations with the Maori and his tattoos, is fascinated by her, buys the piano off her master, and asks her for piano lessons. <br />While her husband plumply tries &quot;to possess&quot; her, Baines wants to touch her in exchange for parts of her piano. She acquiesces, and falls for this strange man who adores her.<br />The actors, the direction, the music are simply outstanding, and if The Piano hadn´t been released in the same year as Schindler´s List, it certainly would have gained more Oscars.<br />Just the end will have you discuss for ages - does she die dreaming or does she dream of dying?
B00004SCX6|3.0|It was the summer of 2000, and i was at camp. Some girl had just bought the latest Britney album...She asked me to listen to one song, and it just so happened to be &quot;Lucky&quot;. I thought it was good, nothing too out of the ordinary. I ended up listening to the whole album and obviously, some of the songs were catchy. But when it comes down to it, only half the album is really worth it..Oops i did it again, Stronger, Dont Go Knockin, Cant get no Satisfaction, What u see is what u get and Lucky are really the only good songs, while 3 or 4 of the other slow, irritating ballads are simply &quot;skip-worthy&quot; and the other few arent worth anyones time. The sad part is is that the songs i listed are only fun to listen to because they are catchy, not b/c britney is a good singer. Hopefully, by her 5th album, Britney will develop some sort of talent that is worthwhile.<BR>Overall, this CD is okay. If you want it, buy it.
B000099T2L|3.0|After hearing 'Crazy in Love' a million times on the radio and still loving it I had to buy Beyonce's solo-album.  I can only rarely be as disappointed as I was when I heard it at full-length.  <br />'Crazy in Love' takes pride of place as it should but, in a way, it ruins the rest of the album.  There are only a couple of tracks that raise any interest on the rest of the album but they are nothing new or original.<br />The only thing I can really say about this album, is that it shows a rising star (not that she isn't already) who will one-day become a legend.  It might take a while though.
0066214122|3.0|Crichton once again amazes readers for his complex grasp on diverse subject matters.  This book looks into the implications of nanotechonology an up and coming field in production.  The story is interesting and keeps the reader guessing.  The one thing that upset me the most about it is that it is exactly like Jurrasic Park.  Man creates a device/creature....man looses control of aforementioned device/creature....terror ensues.  Crichton has overdone his common theme of the dangers of unrestrained scientific exploration.  Prey is extremely similar to Jurrasic park, only on a molecular level.  A good read overall yet not new or surprising.
B000021YQV|5.0|Amazing. Nothing on this album is positive, but Serj screaming, blaring guitars, heavy drumming and fast bass playing all add up to ultimate heavy metal. Song's like X and Prison song prove plitical points and are more fast paced then most of the rest of the album. Prison song opens with a killer 45 second guitar and drum riff, only interrupted by serj whispering:&quot;there trying to build a prison.&quot; Chop Suey! is a killer track which is somewhat staind style swerving in and out of acoustic and amped guitar riffs. Toxicity , the title track on this album is pure heavy metal, and will be pure delight to any heavy metal fan. Deer Dance talks political again about how american goverment &quot;push the weak around&quot;, and is once again captivating because of Malakian's killer heavy metal guitar talent during the choruses. Leaving this albums only comment:any heavy metal, nu-metal or rock fan should buy it soon! Favorite songs:Prison Song, Toxicity, Chop Suey!,X and Deer Dance.
B000060P79|4.0|THIS IS NOT PUNK!!! however, what i've heard of this cd is totally great!! It is lyrically total teeny bopper, but the music is more like teenage totally unnhardcore rock. it is annoying when people call them punk, cuz they're not, but they're still really really good
B000092ZYX|4.0|It is refreshing to see Radiohead attempt something zanily over the top as this, full of carefree blend of rock and roll with electronic experimentation. I mean, look what Metallica have made of themselves...you could pick up any album from them blindfolded and end up with pretty much the same music. I disagree with a bevy of other reviewers that \\"this is not Radiohead\\". This is as much Radiohead as Zooropa was U2. Some ultra-creative bursts of guitar and synthesizer do not a new group make, it is just a band coming up with something they haven't tried before.<br />That said, if you don't dig Radiohead in general, the NATURE of their music I mean not any song in particular, then there may not be anything spectacular here for you to relish or change your stance. But if you care about novel beats and beeps (e.g., \\"The Gloaming\\"), or spooky vocals (\\"We Suck Young Blood\\"), or even a cacophony of guitars on steroids (\\"2 + 2 = 5\\") then you will find yourself duly compensated.<br />Definitely worth a shot!
B00005JLXE|3.0|Ok first off I was so excited to see this movie I just got it today on dvd, until I started to watch it. I have never been so annoyed in my life, you cant hear the actors talking all you can hear is the punching,fighting, and background noises of the city. I cant believe it, they do have a visually impaired version which you can hear them talking,but over them talking you hear some guy talking about what everyone is doing(which is for the visually imparied,which is ok but its still annoying)I wish they would have made version for people who want to see it with the actors talking and dont need the visually imparied.I have not even watched half of it because its just so darn maddening trying to hear.I dont even know if I can watch the rest of it. I dont know what they were thinking a marvel comic made into a movie with NO SOUND-its the stupidiest thing I have ever heard of.So if reading subtitles dont bother you and hearing another guy talking over the acters doesnt, then I am sure this is the movie for you.
B00005JM09|4.0|Was not expecting much given the yawny trailors of the movie. Yet the movie is actually quite a decent action flick...jam-packed with special fx, a phatz new model for the oh so bad girl feeling all blithe and lovely in skin-hugging PVC despite a somewhat flimsier pretext for the cyborgs to be hanging around vamoosing and appearing at will. At some points, you may wonder why the machines dont just linger and get their act over with.<br />The first half is where most of the mind numbing geewhiz stuff is unleashed, but thankfully the movie slacks a little in the second half (perhaps Cameron's influence shows a little late?) adding some tonal balance with a theme. Not quite a landmark in the action genre, T3 still shows Arny has got what it takes to get audiences packing in.<br />Decent weekend popcorn stuff if lickety-split action is your gig. Noteworthy: the climax.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I Love this cd.I bought it on cassette,now I have to buy it on cd for the extra tracks.Michael &amp; Quincy really out did themselves on this one!I'm just 16 years old,so I was just getting hip to things that happened 10,15,20 years ago.Everybody was like &quot;THRILLER&quot; is the best selling album that ever was,and all this hype over it!So I said, why don't I just buy it (since I love Michael Jackson anyway).And when I did I absolutley loved it!!!My favorite songs would have to be &quot;P.Y.T&quot;,&quot;Baby Be Mine&quot;,&quot;Human Nature&quot; &amp; &quot;Lady in my Life&quot;.Buy this album,it's really good.This may not be the 80's anymore, but  Michael Jackson (back then)is cool to me NOW!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This was one of the best movies to come out last year, and it was a stunning film adaptation of a great musical.  CHICAGO was a Kander/Ebb affair which Bob Fosse choreographed in its original incarnation on the Broadway stage back in the 1970s. This was the team behind CABARET, and they were ushering in a new more thought-provoking form of musical theatre with deep themes about unsavory subjects - here female inmates on death row who hunger more for fame than virtue.  But all of it was done with a glee and aw shucks charm!<br />The movie does not disappoint fans of the show - it stays true to the themes and style of the show.  Some songs are cut, and the book is slightly altered - the biggest change is the real world setting which places most all of the musical numbers inside the characters imaginations.  The songs are inner monologues of how they wished the world was contrasted starkly with the prison/court room setting of the more gritty real world.  The style of the entire film comes from the 70s, and is very reminiscent of Bob Fosse's highly praised adaptation of CABARET into a successful film.  It's a piece of art - it apes the style of CABARET so don't expect MOULIN ROUGE.  No quick edits or way over the top orchestrations or even sets.  This is sexy and streamlined!<br />The cast is top-notch.  Catherine Zeta Jones is amazingly well-suited for this kind of production!  So is Queen Latifah and Richard Gere.  Renee Zellweger is right out of the period, and sings very well!  It's all an homage to old school hoofing and singing.  Wonderful!  You can't go wrong.<br />DVD includes a cut song called CLASS with Zeta Jones and Latifah, as well as featurettes and a director's commentary!  Should be the top drawer DVD for 2003!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Honestly, the first time I watched it, I only liked the first half.  Then it started becoming harder to understand.  Then, two months later, I watched it a second time to see if I missed anything.  I missed a lot.  Afterward, I understood it and liked it much better.<br />This is a uniquely crafted movie directed by David Lynch.  \\"Mullholland Dr.\\" blends erotica and mystery beautifully.  Certain clues and many unexpected events keep the audience watching closer.  Every actor expresses their character's emotion at the fullest, especially Naome Watts and Laura Elena Heiring, who play an aspiring actress and a woman struggling with her memory loss.  The movie in its entirity proves that it was well-deserving of its four Golden Globe nominations and an Oscar nomination.  This is recommended for those who love risque movies as one will not be disappointed in this piece of art.<br />***Note: Before you watch \\"Mullholland Dr.\\", click on the \\"Quotes and Trivia\\" on this page.  They'll give you ten clues.  Write them down.  It will help you understand the movie much better.
0385509456|3.0|I spent an enjoyable afternoon with this book.  It is not a masterpiece - the plot is fairly contrived, and the book's resolution is more than a little pat - but the main character, Christopher, is extraordinarily compelling, and the book is certainly very funny and poignant at times. <br />I do, however, think the reviews (particularly the one by Jay McInerney in the NYT book review that led to my purchase) are far more glowing than this book warrants.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u is the best example of shock and awe pop. Virtually every song in the album is classic and perfected by two girls that can sing. People need to look beyond their \\"lesbian\\" image. What their sexual orientation is to only be concerned by them. The fact is these girls are very talented and are going to be huge pop sensations. t.A.T.u Rocks!
0151008116|5.0|While not a book &quot;to make you believe in God,&quot; as is claimed in the text, it will make you think . . . and leave you wondering about the nature of truth, and the criteria you use to evaluate truth-claims.  Definitely worth reading, and keeping on your shelf for later browsing.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I just watched this on DVD and can't believe how much I liked it. The story is nothing new, it could have been pieced together from ten different films, but the acting and storytelling are very good. I'm not sure why I am surprised. I know all the actors in the film are talented and I usually enjoy the movies they star in. I just wasn't compelled to see this movie when it was it theaters. Now I wish I had.<br />I liked the Hulk and Spider-man, but there were times during those films where I thought &quot;come on already; get to another action scene&quot;. In Daredevil, I enjoyed the scenes between the action as much as the fighting. Not that the action wasn't good. It just didn't outshine the characters.<br />I have never read a Daredevil comic. I didn't know anything about this superhero before this movie. But as far as films go I liked it better than Hulk, better than Spider-man, better than Batman. It's probably the best comic-to-movie film since the original Superman.
0805066349|5.0|I first opened this book when I was five years old. I would look at the photos over and over and try to remember the names of each native american. Once I learned to read I couldn't put it down. I have probably read the entire book ten times and certain chapters twenty to thirty times. I still have my father's original copy and all the pages are loose. Without a doubt this book will leave a lump in your throat.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|This film, in my opinion, is one of thhe worst Bond films ever made. Even though I am a Sean Connery fan, this movie just has a really boring plot, a really un-convincing villian, etc.
B00007KWHG|5.0|What more do you want in a disc!  This disc contains an astounding &quot;7&quot; #1 hits, &quot;11&quot; top ten hits, and &quot;2&quot; songs that charted at #12 and #13.  This collection is basically an awesome historic look at American pop music from the early 60's to the late 70's.  It showcases what made Italian-Americans such an integral part of American pop music in the 20th century and Frankie Valli was up there with the best of them.
B000002UJQ|5.0|For once, believe the hype.  This is the greatest album of the past 20 years at least, and is quite possibly the greatest record in rock history.  To not like Radiohead is to not like Mozart; it shows a weakness in your ability to truly listen to great music.  Even for modern rock listeners who struggle to comprehend music played below 150 bpm can understand the utter brilliance of this album.  Every single song is a standout, and the music unfolds like an epic.  And please, if you value your pride, don't compare this album or anything by Radiohead to Coldplay.  Just don't do it.
079070546X|4.0|This film marks the return of the famous slap-stick comedy of the Griswold's.  The film takes place during the Christmas holiday season and revolves around the antics of Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase and his endeavor to provide his family the \\"perfect\\" Christmas.  Everyone can relate to the colorful array of characters and the experience of spending the holiday season with relatives.  Randy Quaid, brings to life the character of Eddie, who is Clark's unemployed, mooching cousin and will make anyone appreciate their own unique relative.  The script written by the ever popular, John Hughes, is priceless in its content of tasteless humor.<br />This film deserves a four out of five stars rating.  If it isn't already a part of your family's holiday tradition it's worth considering adopting.
B00005B36H|5.0|Listen, I am one of the biggest Tool fanatics out there. I have listened to every album countless times and I love them all. But this one has them all beat. Lateralus is beyond anything I had ever seen before it and it is beyond everything that has come out after it. I honestly don't see how anybody could enjoy Aenima over Lateralus, but of course, we all have our own musical preferences. This album changed my life, literaly. I don't like fads and I don't buy into trends in music and this album is totaly unique and is the ultimate brainchild of Tool. I think it's the first album where they totaly stepped out of anything resembling &quot;convention&quot; in music today. In Opiate through Aenima, I think there was progressively less convention in each album. But this is the one where they severed that tie and stepped out. The songs are beautiful masterpieces that no doubt took a tremendous amount of work, effort and passion. I love the lyrics to this album as well. They are deep and multi-layerd, just like the rest of the album. Every member is at his creative peak I believe. The climax for me is the monstrous ending to Lateralus, which segues into the mindboggling acid trip of a trilogy Disposition, Reflection, Triad. This album will always have a place in my heart for the rest of my life. If Tool is able to top this album, it will be a monumental feat to say the least.
B000050XEI|4.0|Wow! Why do I love this album? I must confess that my musical tastes are far louder (i.e. hard rock, industrial, alt. rock, alt. metal) than Enya, but I know beauty and talent when I hear it. It would be wrong to mention specific songs, since the whole album is an aural experience, but &quot;Only Time&quot; must be mentioned because it is quite possibly her best song yet; a true musical epiphany. I love the fact that the entire album isn't in English; the Irish and Latin tracks are a really nice touch, especially for me since I study both of these languages for pure interest. Like many other reviewers, my only complaint is that there aren't MORE Irish language tracks, and the album a little longer. A very small complaint, however, when measured against the incredible effect this album has on a listener able to appreciate what this Celtic heroine has bestowed upon us.
0689859368|4.0|A very fun book. Good for light reading. It's nothing too great, but it's enjoyable and breezy reading.  This book doesn't transport you to a magical world, but it definitely does exercise your imagination.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Like all great albums, this one didn't set well with me at first.   In fact, I was really dissapointed with it as I scrolled thru the tracks.  But now I can't quit listening to it.  The beats are infectious, and the music quality is top-notch.  The best aspect though, are the flows.  These rhymes are the definiton of what I consider great hip-hop; they push the boundries of what is considered the new cool.  So give it more than just on listen, and I swear you'll get your \\"hands up\\".  (the best track, next to 'where is the love' is 'latin girls'; it's just damn sexy)
B0000009SG|5.0|To say that ONE album is the best among more than sixty very good ones may seem at least strange. But if you go through all of them here at Amazon, you will see that every single Zappa cd  has at least one review saying \\"the best\\". To me, IF I HAD TO PICK ONE, that would be Over-nite sensation. Some of his best songs are here, mixing the intrincated riffs and not-of-this-world tempos, with beautiful melodies and tasty playing ( from all musicians ).<br />A very close second is ZOOT ALLURES.
B000068FXX|5.0|This cd is just an awesome 70s album. Each track is very detailed, and although there are only 7 tracks, the cd clocks in at a generous 44 minutes. The opener, Give A Little Bit, was the bands hit song, and deservedly so. It's extremely catchy and has a spirited and uplifting vibe to it. Lover boy starts off like a broadway theme song, but there's a progressive Yes-like feel towards the latter half of the extravagance. The title track, Even In The Quietest Moments, brings Pink Floyd to mind with its meandering psychedelia and nebulous charm. Downstream sounds similar to early Elton John recordings, with heartfelt lyrics and lilting piano. Babaji is a dramatic ballad sounding like a precursor to a lot of other 80s songs that would sound very similar to this authentic track. Track 6, From Now On, is my favorite on the cd. It reminds me of Billy Joel, but is much longer and more intricate than any of his songs. The entire song is great, but around the 2 minute mark, the refrain &quot;Living in a fantasy, that's the way its got to be, from now on&quot; resounds gloriously with a choir of backround vocals in an ebullient, timeless fashion. The lengthy Fool's Overture provides a wonderful closing to a classic recording. This song has elements of just about every band imaginable from their era. At times, it sounds a bit like Kraftwerk, and at other's, like the Beatles experimental track from the White Album, #9. The track is also comparable to some Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (Tarkus). To sum things up, this is just a beautiful, florid album, coalescing brilliant originality with popular musical elements of the time, offering an incredible, unique album that I recommend to everyone.
B00009TB5G|1.0|Exorcisms?  The Attack of Willard and the Giant Junkyard Rats? X-treme sports archery?<br />Is this the The Two Towers that made J.R.R. Tolkien one of the  ten best selling authors of the entire 1970's?  Is this The Two  Towers that forced a generation of gritics to admit that, yes, a  book could be quality literature and entertaining at the same  time?  Is this The Two Towers sprung from the literary genius  of Tolkien, whose towering imagination was fed by all that has  been good in Western civilization, from Beowulf to the Bible to  the heroism of Britain and the Allies in World War II?<br />Answers: A) No.  B) No.  C) No.<br />Peter Jackson is pretty much doing for Tolkien's The Lord of  the Rings what Sherman did for the South.  He continues his  ravaging of this milestone of human imagination, begun in  LOTR 1 The Fellowship of the Ring, in his second installment  The Two Towers.<br />A lot of folks over the years have been telling us that artistic  inspiration and ... just simply don't mix.  If there was ever any doubt, The Two Towers sweeps it away in a flood of aesthetically senseless plot tinkerings that serve only to give Liv Tyler some much-coveted face time that Tolkien's story wouldn't have given her.  Aragorn is given a dream sequence  with Liv that makes him look like he isn't man enough to sit on  the throne in his own bathroom, let alone the throne of Gondor.   And then the poor guy has to go wounded and MIA so that Liv can come to his side and kiss the boo-boos and make them better in an out-of-body experience sort of way. [...]    Tolkien's mighty  tree-folk come out looking like they are made of balsa wood.   But [Dominic] Monaghan gets to deliver a sermon on inter-species unity  that would have done Captain Kirk proud.<br />Jackson expands on his portrait of Saruman as polluter  extraordinaire.  The White Wizard watches his his orcs tear  down oak trees and gleefully exclaims, \\"Living things will fall to the forges of industry!\\"  Geez, we don'tneed Gandalf here.  We need Ted Turner's \\"Captain Planet\\"!<br />One thing The Two Towers has done for me is help me better appreciate the subtlety in Tolkien's masterpiece.  Jackson's comparative clumsiness most strongly shows itself in his treatment of Gollum.  Tolkien's Gollum was sort of an Everyman with a penchant for super-fresh sushi.  Tolkien was able to evoke simultaneously both Frodo's pity for the poor creature and Sam's disgust at the twisted little vermin.  I don't know if any movie crew could transfer this dialectic to the silver screen, but Jackson apparently didn't even think it worth trying.  Seizing on the proclivity Tolkien gave Gollum for talking to himself, Jackson decides Gollum is a victim of -- ... -- Multiple Personality Disorder courtesy the Power of the Ring.  This is a terribly important misstep, because fundamental to Tolkien's story is the idea that the Ring has power over men, hobbits, whoever, only to the extent that it can call out to the greed, power lust, fear, or whatever that is already inside them. Tolkien's Gollum is a magnification of the human condition. Jackson's Gollum just needs a good dose of prozac.<br />There were more than a couple of places where Jackson could  have avoided overkill just by MAKING THE CONFOUNDED MOVIE THE WAY TOLKIEN WROTE IT!!!  Jackson's most egregious transgression here comes when Nameless Character A (avoiding a spoiler here) has come under Saruman's influence and Nameless Character B is going to set things straight.  In Tolkien's book, Character B fixes the problem by essentially taking Character A out to the woodshed.  But no, that's not good enough for Jackson.  He has decided that what Tolkien should have done was give us a full-fledged exorcism. \\"Come out of him, Saruman!\\"  \\"If I go, he dies!\\"  \\"You will not hurt him and you will not hurt me!  Come out!\\"  \\"Gyaaahhhh!\\" Why didn't Jackson just finish the job and put in a couple of head spins and a gallon of green lost lunch?<br />Other \\"improvements\\" include Orcs riding big, nasty warf rats.  And Elf Legolas shooting arrows as he SKATEBOARDS DOWN A STAIRWAY!!!  It's the stuff that the D&Ders want to see, but it rips the ozone layer away from the atmosphere that Tolkien created.<br />Why, oh why, does Peter Jackson need to \\"improve\\" on Tolkien?  Look Pete, on the one hand we have you: capable director. On the other hand, we have J.R.R.: out-and-out literary genius.  Capable.  Genius.  Capable. Genius. Which one of the two of you should be improving on the other?<br />There are alot of fantasy fans who will love this movie and will think I am crazy for being so derogatory.  I'll try to explain myself: Think about it, folks. The Lord of the Rings is still going strong after pert near fifty years.  How much thought have you given to any of the fantasy serials that you were reading just three years ago?  Doesn't that make you think that there was maybe some \\"magick\\" in it that your other little entertainments just don't have?  In The Lord of the Rings you have yourself a bag full of diamonds.  Don't treat it like a hackey sack!
B0000A1RJI|3.0|I bought this soundtrack because I LOVE the movie Pirates of the Caribbean and enjoy every aspect of it, especially the music.  The music featured in this movie is some of the greatest I have heard since ID4 and is most worthy of its own soundtrack.  The disc that was released, however, does not live up to the full potential that it could have been.  Many of the tracks are incredibly short at an average of a minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes, I get the distinct feeling that some of the tracks that were actually used in the movie were left out of the disc, one being the end credits theme that I loved so much, and many of the tracks are actually cut short.  Very little is given from the disc, where one would want or even expect a recap of the incredible piece of music they just heard they will find themselves being briskly rushed into the next track.  Because of how truly wonderful the music is this disc had potential to be something truly incredible, but instead the producers felt the need to shortchange the disc and thus the consumer.  Still, the music is truly wonderful and very memorable.  The music itself will stick with you long after listening to it and haunt you with its sometimes beautiful and sometimes invigorating tunes, and it is only because the music is so good that I gave this disc a 3 instead of a 2 or 1.  If only a little better planning had gone into the making of this CD, it could VERY easily be a 5 or better in my books.  Perhaps someday a re-release will be made, one with the end credits included and with nice long pieces of music that will COMPLETELY capture and toy with the imagination of its listener, but until then for those of you who enjoy the movie Pirates of the Caribbean as much as I do this will serve as an excellent addition to your musical library.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Without a doubt, Radiohead has become one of the best and most innovative rock groups over the past 10 years. Many doubted their staying power when &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was released during the height of grunge music. However, Radiohead proved time and again, as they do on &quot;Hail To The Thief,&quot; that they are not a fluke...that they are (dare I say it) the equivalent of Pink Floyd for the gen-x'ers. &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; moves away from the electronic instrumentation and offbeat movements of their last two records, &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac,&quot; which put an end to the massive mainstream radio-friendly audience that wanted more of &quot;The Bends.&quot; That's disappointing, because &quot;...Thief&quot; is &quot;Ok Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; (their best albums from an artistic standpoint) put into a blender - and that's not a bad thing. The album possesses great songs with moving lyrics, sweeping music, and as always Thom Yorke's haunting voice. Really, is there anyone alive who can sing better than this guy? Tracks like &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot; and &quot;Backdrifts&quot; come with such melodic grooves that they carry you off, like a gentle breeze to a magical place. Whereas tunes like &quot;2+2=5,&quot; &quot;There There&quot; and &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; just use straight forward alt-rock to knock you off your feet. This band isn't for everyone, I know that. I realize that a lot of people don't like Radiohead, and that's fine by me. But what those people are missing, I believe, is some of the best music to be produced since the days of Nirvana, Jeff Buckley and early 90's Sonic Youth. As a fan of Radiohead I can tell you that this is an amazing record and will sure to be in my stereo for quite a while. I look forward anxiously to the next studio album. For the casual music fan that is unsure of whether or not to buy this: start with the 1995 classic &quot;The Bends&quot; and work your way up the slope. I don't think you'd truly be able to appreciate this album otherwise.think you'd truly be able to appreciate this album otherwise.
B0000027RL|5.0|If you don't own this album, you are a sinner. As close as mankind as come to proving the existence of God.
B00006F7S4|5.0|You certainly need to be in the right mood to listen to SEA CHANGE.  It's not much for painting the house, having a dinner party, or even driving (since it may inspire you to veer off a bridge).  The album is as gloomy as anything in recent pop music; but it's hard to deny the incredibly haunting melodies of each piece, and the soulful, melancholic effect that builds on you by the end of &quot;Lost Cause.&quot;  <br />By turning away from the more popular and accessible work of his last album, Beck has shown himself to be a remarkable artist.  The album has all of the surprises and insights of any true work of art.  Like an inverse of Dylan going electric; this is Beck abandoning the aggressive turntablism of his last album and adopting a folksier style.  As sad as the album can be, its sheer lyricism saves it from self-pity, and--by the end--the listener begins to feel a new kind of beauty and truth emerging from the moodiness.  <br />Beck has put together a phenomenal album, and shown us that his career might take any turn at any time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Although many were shocked to experience Christina Aguilera's new image, it was about time she showed us the real Christina.  While her self-titled debut album might not have offered much, three years was worth the wait.  \\"Stripped\\" is a winner - displaying Christina's amazing, super-natural like vocals, and showing us that she's not that squeeky clean blonde that first appeared back in 1999 who poured out cheesy bubble-gum pop ballads.<br />I find it disappointing that many people refuse to listen to any tracks other than \\"Dirrty\\" on this album due to her very naughty music video - but it's pretty much their loss.  Christina is beginning to carve her name as a legend.<br />1. \\"Stripped Intro\\" / (5/5) / Christina quickly sums up what you're about to discover about her.<br />2. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (featuring Lil' Kim) / (4/5) / Although it's a great anthem for women about the common double standard of men being able to \\"get away with murder\\" while the woman gets the punishment for being expressive, Lil' Kim's horrible rap really mixed my rating.<br />3. \\"Walk Away\\" / (5/5) / One of the best tracks on \\"Stripped.\\"  Christina displays the intensity of her amazing vocal range with this slow, emotional, sad ballad.<br />4. \\"Fighter\\" / (5/5) / When it comes to mixing Hard Rock with Pop, Christina pulls it off beautifully with this in-your-face ballad about gaining inner strength.<br />5. \\"Primer Amor Interlude\\" / (5/5) / A great interlude - Christina speaks such fluent Spanish.<br />6. \\"Infatuation\\" / (5/5) / Although it may not be a choice for the repeat button, it's still a great, upbeat Pop mixed with Latin song.<br />7. \\"Loves Embrace Interlude\\" / (2.5/5) / Nice effects, but it didn't rub me the right way.<br />8. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" / (5/5) / This is a very soft, sweet Pop and R&B mixed song.<br />9. \\"Impossible\\" / (4/5) / This is basically Christina singing Alicia Keys (who collaborated on this song).  It's a good song for the first few listens, but it goes downhill after listening to it too many times.  To me, this song is flawed with its rhythm.<br />10. \\"Underappreciated\\" / (5/5) / The way these songs sound is very mixed, but Christina expands on her variet of music choices.  This song sounds like a mix of Jazz, R&B, and Pop.  It's an OK song, basically.<br />11. \\"Beautiful\\" / (5/5) / How many people can relate to this song? A lot.  This is a very beautiful song speaking of inner and outer beauty in a good way - how everyone is beautiful as a person no matter how they are or how they look.  This is one of the best tracks on \\"Stripped.\\"  Christina's powerful vocals really shine through this ballad.<br />12. \\"Make Over' / (3.5/5) / I'm not into this mix of Latin/Hard Rock/Pock song.  For some reason, to me, it was a bad choice of song.  It sounds whiny and demanding at the same time.  This should've been approached in a different way.<br />13. \\"Cruz\\" / (5/5) / This song starts off beautifully with no music, then is follwed by a piano and Christina's calm, intense voice.  The lyrics perfectly blend well with the piano and Christina's voice.<br />14. \\"Soar\\" / (5/5) / This is a great song which relates to the previous track \\"Beautiful\\" - this is more of an encouraging song which comes right after \\"Beautiful.\\"<br />15. \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" / (5/5) / Need I remind you, Christina isn't that squeeky clean bubble-gum Popper she used to be.  This song moves into a more Mid-Teen/Pre-Adult/Adult category with its sexy lyrics and sexy groove.  This is an okay song for young teens who are more matured than immature 12 year olds.  Christina is a great role model and is not a \\"slut.\\" This song will leave guys feeling hot in the collar.<br />16. \\"Dirrty\\" (featuring Redman) / (5/5) / This is a great upbeat party anthem.  This song is anything but trashy - the music video is.  While the lyrics may have more mature content, it's still a safe song to listen to.  People probably think of Christina now as the \\"Dirrty\\" girl instead of her one \\"GenieIn A Bottle\\" image.<br />17. \\"Stripped Pt. 2\\" / (5/5) / Christina couldn't have chosen a better placement for this track, concluding the \\"Stripped Intro.\\"  Christina is NOT trashy.  She has re-invented herself in such a great way, being able to be who she really is.<br />18. \\"The Voice Within\\" / (5/5) / Nothing wrong with sounding like Mariah Carey (who is one of the best singing artists to have ever existed).  This song starts off to a more softer, personal side of Christina and her music.  I can't believe people negatively respond to this touching ballad - do they NOT listen to the lyrics?<br />19. \\"I'm OK\\" / (5/5) / Instantly creating a dark and sad atmosphere, this song could easily leave you tearful.  This is a very personal song for Christina to have recorded.  It's more than an \\"OK\\" song, it's essential.  This is a song about \\"living in a war called home.\\"<br />20. \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" / (5/5) / As you've probably guessed, I've been reading that 12 year old fan's review below.  Why should you use religion when rating a song? Don't you understand the message of these songs? I think this is a great way to conclude \\"Stripped\\" which is truly an essential album.  This song is basically a conclusion of all of Christina's previous tracks, which is greatly pulled off with the choir.  This song basically tells us that Christina doesn't care what anyone else thinks about her, because she's going to keep doing what she wants to.  This is a happy ending to this fairytale.<br />I, for one, of course, support Christina and her music.  She is truly a talented person with a God-given gift.  While writing and producing most of her songs on \\"Stripped\\", that, along with Christina's powerful songs, make \\"Stripped\\" golden.  I can't wait to see what she has to offer next - she's going to be with us for a LONG time.

B00005QAPH|5.0|Everyone has already said everything that can be said other than hearing it from the horse's mouth.  Fellini is the man and this is his finest work.
B00004T6V4|5.0|I discovered the movie, &quot;Still Crazy&quot; a year ago, and fell in love with it.  Now I own the STILL CRAZY SOUNDTRACK, and this little jewel is just as entertaining as the film.<br />This CD brings back a flood of images from the movie, beginning with the first--and in my opinion, best--cut:  &quot;The Flame Still Burns.&quot;  Some of my other favorites include &quot;All Over The World&quot; and &quot;A Woman Like That.&quot;  And I can't help but laugh out loud when I listen to &quot;Scream Freedom&quot; as I think about Bill Nighy's futile and hilarious attempt in the movie to create &quot;shock rock.&quot;<br />Bill Nighy and Jimmy Nail are incredibly gifted vocalists as well as actors.  Steve Donnelly is superb on the guitar; his rifts are clean, clear, and crisp.  Kudos to Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley for producing this phenomenal CD.  Now let's just round up Strange Fruit and send them on tour!<br />--D. Mikels
B00005ATQF|5.0|A deeply disturbing, yet mostly accurate, piece of cinema genius. I can't really top what's already been said from the guys here who made it through Parris, especially about the perplexing, yet intriguing, contrast between the first and second half of the movie.<br />I didn't make it through Parris Island but can assure you that Gunny R. Lee Ermey deserves an academy award for the most accurate portrayal of a drill sergeant Hollywood can possibly offer. Bravo to the film execs who looked past any politically-correct bias and realized that this guy was the real deal. I'd buy this for his performance alone although the rest of the movie is equally great-Kubrik classic.<br />My mates made it to Desert Storm so i defer to those reviewers who have experienced combat to comment on the second half of the film. However, having spoken to numerous veterans and having done my senior thesis on the Vietnam conflict, I rate this movie top-notch along with The Deerhunter. Semper Fidelis to all who survived the hell of boot camp as well as the hell of war.
6304602901|4.0|A MALCONTENT [STEVE GUTTENBERG] GETS FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE POLICE ACADEMY. VERY FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING ON ALL LEVELS. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS FILM IS MICHAEL WINSLOW, THE MAN WHO PLAYS LARVELL JONES, WHOSE A HUMAN SOUND EFFECTS MACHINE. A CULT CALSSIC BY ALL MEANS. OF COURSE, THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE SCRIPT OR ITS STORY, BUT IT'S JUST FUNNY. A MUST FOR ANYONE THAT LIKES TO LAUGH THEIR A.. OFF. FOLLOWED BY SIX SEQUELS, AN ANIMATED TV SERIES, AND INSPIRED A LIVE-ACTION TV SERIES.
0393316041|5.0|Simply superb. Feyman is hilarious. A must-read.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ok, Ok, guys. For all those out there who are debating to get this album, I've been there. And for those who don't understand her fame but are willing to give it a try because of the acclaim,<BR>i've been there too. so I think you can trust me to give you a good review. When Norah Jones burst onto the music scene with \\"Don't Know Why\\" I thought, 'With that horrible music, she's not gonna last long.' THen, I heard the raves and the hype and was like, 'Are you freaks deaf? That's the worst music I ever heard!' but as the hype built, I thought, 'Maybe there's something to this woman I missed.' So everytime her single came on, I listened hard, and what do you know? I learned to love it.<BR>So I listened to sample tracks here on Amazon and was surprised to find they weren't that bad. So I put her major label debut on my wish list really only wanting it because of her grammy wins and fame. THen, time went on, and I had every CD on my list, but I still did not have a copy of Ms. Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\". And everytime opportunity struck, I said, no, I'll get it next time. So I kept putting it off and putting it off, until here it<BR>is 2003 and nope, no disc. This year, I listened to her samples and was SHOCKED to find I genuinely LOVED HER MUSIC. I don't know how it happened, but I knew now was the time to buy \\"come away\\" at long last. and yes, I love it. It's a classic and a masterpiece. it's gorgeous jazz with a husky yet soothing voice. One note and if you're taken unawares, norah's seductive croon of a voice will completely whisk you away. Come Away with Me will not be an invitation, it will be an automatic response. For those of you who can't appreciate real, true-blue music, this isn't for you. For uncultured swine and phillistines, this isn't for you. And for those who say all her songs sound the same, you can listen to the five clips and see that isn't true. \\"Don't Know<BR>Why\\" \\"Seven Years\\" \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\" and the title track all soundcompletely different. The tempos and melodies are also way different; yes, every song is slow, but that doesn't mean they all sound alike. So- if you want beautiful music, an enchanting voice and true art, give this a try. Who knows? You may just come away with Norah.
0671027344|5.0|My girlfriend told me I should read it, and after her telling me how much she was into it, I asked her to let me borrow it. From beginning to end I couldn't put the book down. Maybe from my perspective as a teenager I could relate with so much of what Charlie was saying. I would recomend this book to anyone growing up right now. The book pulls you in and sort of makes you Charlies best friend. I would recommend this book.
B00004RJ74|4.0|This movie is two movies in one.  First of all the charactors are developed for over half of the movie.  No Vampires yet, you will still be interested.  The story is centered around two criminals trying to get to Mexico and freedom.  George Clooney is at his very best in every seen.  Anyway the brothers kidnap a family to get over the border.  The father of this family is Harvey Keitel playing a Minister who resently lost his wife to a car crash and his faith is tested.  This fast paced story is kicked up a notch when they reach the point of destination.  A topless bar in Mexico.  What is not known is the Bar is opperated by vampires.  The movie has some old actors from the seventy's making it even better.  The extras on this dvd are great, a must see.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Extreme Excellence!  Led Zeppelin Rules!<br />In the words of James Brown, &quot;If you have any type of soul feel it! Put you hand on the box and feel it!\\" How The West Was Won [LIVE], is the perfect definition of ROCK!<br />I strongly recommend this Master Piece if you are a Led Zeppelin, Rock or Funk fan.  If you think, otherwise go watch American Idol Punk!
B00009XITQ|2.0|Sometimes I enjoy silly films if they are heartwarming enough, but that wasn't the case with this one. It is packed with cliches, Amanda Bynes is boringly portrayed as this free-spirited American teen with an innocent disregard for English pomposity and the airs and graces of her relatives. After being pestered by the stereotypical, arrogant public-school boy with his condescending attitude to the other 'lower clahss imbuhcile', she falls for the nice boy who's really american at heart, free and classless. When this lad she falls for starts talking about \\"I was a part of this system and I just came to realise how shallow it is\\" (or whatever) I felt like laughing. There are many more stupid aspects but I can't be bothered mentioning them.<br />I enjoyed watching Amanda Bynes, she's really beautiful with her cute teenage demeanor... otherwise, there is not much worth seeing.
B000006ZVU|5.0|Firefly is one of my favorite albums of all time. Both the musicianship and lyrics are all dynamic. Right off the bat, the CD begins with the powerful &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; which is one of the most unique songs ever written: heavy echoing guitars and great vocals. Next is another adventure type song of note &quot;Been Away too Long&quot;. The more mellow &quot;Wise Man&quot; became very popular and occurs on some &quot;live&quot; cuts on other albums. &quot;Sympathy&quot; has fabulous wah-wah guitar work - perfect rythym - and slide guitar - it is PERFECT. <br />The song &quot;Firefly&quot; is another fantasy classic - perfectly arranged composition, complete with changes in tempo and slide guitar melodies. All the songs mentioned above should have been played on the radio here in the U.S. - they are all hits. And yet I never heard any of them ... until I bought it myself. I was astounded that I never heard these songs before. This is one of Heep's most cohesive albums - as good as Demons &amp; Wizards; Magicians Birthday, etc. This is some of the best rock music ever written - old or new. If you don't have this CD, you are truly depriving your soul of Uriah Heep's best work.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is not about the fight scenes or special effects.  It is the story of how a man overcomes both disastrous events and faces his personal struggles.  All the characters in this movie are wonderfully real and the movie has a great soundtrack also.<br />If you think Commodus was corny in the movie, obviously you don't know anything about Roman history;  some emperors were actually more crazy than him.  It took me until the third viewing to understand how masterfully he was portrayed.<br />Don't just watch this movie for the battle scenes; it is so much more than that.  Watch it for the characters and how their beliefs affect their decisions.  If I could never see another movie except for this one, that would be fine with me.  Ridley Scott is a genius!
6305922756|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time showing the hard ships of being in a heavy metal band during the 80s. Spinal Tap started in the sixties and had a big hit with \\"Listen To The Flower People\\" but like Deep Purple, changed from a psychedelic influenced pop band to more hard metal driven rock. Singer/guitarist David St. Hubbins is one of the greatest singers in metal history, I put him up there with Quiet Riot's Kevin DuBrow and Mark Slaughter plus St. Hubbins kind of reminds me of that dude that played Lenny on Laverne & Shirley. Great DVD loaded with extras, I also recommend Spinal Tap's cds Shark Sandwich and Smell The Glove, the latter of which Metallica totally ripped off with their 'black' album...I think Lars & the boys should start paying Spinal Tap some royalties.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I admit it, I was skeptical about the show's premise at first, but after watching it, Smallville became one of my favorite shows.  It has the drama, the humor, the great writing and great cast.  Smallville is the type of show that the whole family could watch together, and there's something in each episode for everyone.  Tom Welling, of course, is eye candy and he's perfectly cast as the pre-flying Superman.  He shows a lot of sensitivity, but he does not overplay a scene.  Michael Rosenbaum has a lot of charisma, and it's always interesting when he's in a scene.  One anxiously awaits his next moves because one does not know if he's going to do something bad or good.  John Schneider & the woman who plays Clark Kent's mom are both wonderful actors also.  I'm glad to see John Schneider on TV again; he still looks great.
B0000844IT|4.0|This is the third and (so far) final entry in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series directed by Sam Raimi. There seems to be a definite progression from one entry to the next: the first one is more or less a &quot;serious&quot; horror film, the second one is more of a horror-comedy, and &quot;Army&quot; pretty much abandons any pretense of being scary in favor of cheesy humor and campy action-adventure antics. That said, this is a very entertaining movie if you have a taste for the weird. Bruce Campbell is very effective as Ash, the average guy who spends half the movie being a braggart coward and the other half being a hero. It's this wacky character who really brings the movie to life, although this also means that the second half (where the character is submerged under numerous battle scenes) is rather inferior to the first. All the same, &quot;Army&quot; is a unique and enjoyable experience. There have been several DVDs of this movie and the &quot;Boomstick Edition&quot; is the biggest package. It features the U.S. theatrical cut on disc one, with the &quot;director's cut&quot; (which is longer and has a different ending) on disc two, along with the requisite commentaries, a special-effects featurette, and more. Now, if only Raimi and Campbell can put together a fourth episode...
B00006BTCA|5.0|Dont do heroin, do interpol. Interpol : greatest drug of all time.
0553277472|4.0|The narrator used to be a different person he refers to as Phaedrus.  The reader gets the idea that the narrator had been through the rigors of a mental hospital until he stopped being Phaedrus.  Phaedrus was a Professor of Rhetoric, but couldn't stand his Epiphanies.  Now in the present time of the story the narrator is on a voyage across America with his eleven year old son on the back of his motorcycle and, riding along with them are a middle-class, unaware couple who are friends but who don't really know the narrator or his son very well.  They are riding their motorcycle, but know nothing about how to take care of one.  The narrator knows everything about motorcycle maintenance and uses this subject as the basis for his philosophy.  The narrator carries off the traditional role of &quot;father knows best&quot; to his son.  He is rude and peremptory towards the boy.  This personality clashes with the rest of his image as &quot;wise philosopher.&quot;  There is unending common sense philosophy and logic presented and the narrative is written around it.  One thought that I found interesting was that the scholars of the medieval world taught that Earth is a flat platform.  If one walks too close to the edge, one might fall off and be lost forever in the outer darkness.  The people at that time were terrified of this possibility.  But today, we are taught that Reason is the platform on which we live.  If we move too close to the edge of Reason, we might fall off and be lost to forever to insanity.  This is what now terrifies people.<br />It is an interesting book, but its seventies outlook comes through.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is not a subtle film.  It employs everything--lighting, camera tricks, music (the score alone is a work of art)--to get its message across.  I think it should be required viewing for every American teenager.  It will shock and horrify them, and that's a good thing, considering the subject matter.  Ellen Burstyn (who, let's be honest, could turn a piece of you-know-what film into a wonder by her mere presence in it) is amazing; she completely loses herself in the role.  I was moved and saddened by her initial loneliness, by her wish to be on TV, by her descent into addiction.  Jared Leto is good, but it's hard to compete with Burstyn.  Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his girlfriend, and Marlon Wayans shows a range never glimpsed in his shallow comedic roles.  His final scene is particularly moving.  I didn't like Aronofsky's first film, though I saw the man had talent, and this proves it.  Not for people who look for escape in their movies, but for anyone who loves originality and experimentation in film.
B00008PX8P|5.0|All I can say is that the epic rendition of &quot;How Many More Times&quot; captures the true essence, power, and magic of the band.  That performance alone is worth the price of the DVD.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I listened to what would become Evanescence's big hit, &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; it sent chills through my body. Amy Lee is in a class of her own when it comes to her spine-chilling vocals and deep to-the-soul lyrics. Evanescence immediately became my favorite band. A few months later, I began hearing them on the radio..soon getting extensive airplay. I had been anticipating the release of their cd, Fallen for what seemed like forever. I picked it up the first day it was out the shelfs, popped it in the cd player and I was completely blown away by the new tracks I wasn't able to preview. A female-fronted rock band hasn't hit the mainstream in quite some time. Evanescence is a dream come true to both me and other girls looking for a rock icon in a female-fronted band. Fallen brings chilling ballads together with powerful guitar-driven straight up rock and roll..all with Amy's beautifully haunting voice. I see Evanescence going far with thier career in music, not only because of their astounding talent, but because of their strong passion for what they are doing. This album definately recieves 5 stars from me, and is very much worth the buy.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's new cd is amazing.  Its a cd that never requires you to touch a button.  Gavin's sound is unlike anything else.  There are all the guys like Mraz and Dave who are no doubt amazing but they all have guitars as the main instrument.  Gavin uses a piano which is way cool.  The way he plays it and the way he sings us unreal.  On his new cd, he has everything from music to chill to, to upbeat songs that you just have to sing along to while driving.  Also, if you have a chance to see him live i suggest you do so.  I saw him at a coffee house in Chicago and he was amazing.  If you are in to new artists with new styles, Gavin is the man for you.  So get your copy of chariot if your into this style and you won't be dissapointed
B00003CWTI|5.0|Many individuals in today's society are ignorant to the fact that movies are so much more than just a way of killing time. They are an escape, a way for someone to make their own conclusions about the incidents both in the film, and in their own lives. It is a way to draw parallels to reality. Just like a painting, film is an art form. However, film has gone drastically downhill over the past few decades. As society has become more and more lazy and unintelligent, films have become more and more obvious and spoon-fed.<br />    This is right about where Paul Thomas Anderson comes into play. A brilliant writer/director, he had his beginning with the little known movie, Hard Eight. Afterwards, he became strongly credited for his fascinating work in the masterpiece Boogie Nights. Along comes Magnolia, a film that he KNEW wouldn't do well in the box office. News flash: Artists like P.T. also NEVER CARE how well their films do in the box office. The reason for this is because they know how obnoxiously lazy American moviegoers are today.<br />    Magnolia is a film about drastically different, yet all very troubled lives that connect with each other on one incredible day. P.T. knows his characters well enough to be able to make their actions forgivable, and knows how to make them utterly realistic. His directing is nothing short of genius. P.T. uses the ever-moving camera technique to show how incredibly detailed and expansive his worlds are. Just as in-depth as his environments are his characters. The range of emotions that these people face are incredible, and the entire movie will, quite simply be, the most emotionally exhausting 3 hours of your life.<br />    To those who hate this film: It is quite obvious that the individuals who ridicule this movie quite simply JUST DON'T GET IT. Yes, it is frustrating when one comes to face the fact that they just don't have the intelligence to understand such a brilliant piece of art as this, whether it be the directing, the acting, the symbolism, etc. Whatever the case...if you didn't understand it, that's your problem, and it does not give you the right to bash this smart, funny, and ultimately, very sad film.<br />    One of the best films ever made, and there is no excuse for anyone not to own it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|A lot of people complain that the movie had some completely unnecessary departures from the book it was based on.  And I certainly agree that many if not all of those departures were unnecessary and very annoying, since the Director has essentially chosen to change the story line as he sees fit, rather than preserving the work as the Author had originally written it.<br />But despite the validity of all of these arguments, the bottom line is that this movie is still so much better than the average movie that comes out these days that it clearly deserves all five stars.  If you liked the first Lord of the Rings movie, do not miss out on this one!
B000002J03|5.0|Oh my god!  This is a timeless album.  Lemon Song, Thank You, Ramble On, etc  Excellent effort for only the #2 album.  Good production and sound improvements from the first one.
B000069HKH|4.0|Bruce Springsteen is always at his best when events close to him stir his muse.  From 1975's \\"Born to Run\\" through 1984's \\"Born in the USA\\", Bruce's album's could rightly be called works of genius.  In these albums he chronicled the trials and tribulations of blue collar factory town losers.  Sometimes his tales reeked of despair sometimes his heroes find a way to live their lives to the fullest.    Always though, were the anthems, the fierce rock and roll that Bruce and his heroes love so much.  After Born in the USA, Springsteen seemed to lose his way.  I found his post 1984 albums tedious and dull.  It took the dreadful events of September 11 to reawaken Bruce's muse.  The \\"Rising\\" is not as great as Born to Run or the River but it is great nonetheless.<br />Bruce's heroes are now grown up, even middle aged and are coping with almost inconcievable loss.  A few of the songs make a direct reference to Sept. 11 like \\"You're Missing\\" \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"Into the Fire\\".  Others are more general and deal with the feelings anyone suffering the sudden loss of a loved one would feel.  Like the heroes of Thunder Road or Born to Run, the narrator of \\"Lonesome Day\\" tries to deal with the hand he has been dealt.  The lyrics and Bruce's melancholy vocals are heartbreaking.  And yet the hook that lingers is the line \\"It's Alright It's Alright yeah!\\"  He will get by.   My personal favorite is \\"Mary's Place.\\"    With hooks and a melody line reminiscent of his classic anthems, this song is powerfully moving.  The narrator is dealing with the loss of his beloved and seems to be trying anything, \\"Pictures of Buddah\\", \\"the words of the Prophet\\".  Nothing works.  He attends a party.  He walks around in a fog.  Then it hits him.  Music is the key! \\"Turn it up! Turn it up Turn it up Turn it Up!\\"   He plays her favorite records. (of course they are records not CDs) And he gets by.<br />Not every song is great.  All are at least good.  The album is brilliantly produced with much heavier guitar work, less sax and prominent string parts.  The E-Street Band is in excellent form.  Bruce fans will certainly want to own this album.  Bruce becomes the first rock musician I know of who has returned from what seemed to be a permanent decline.  Good for him!
0780631684|5.0|This is one of the greatest scary movies out there.  If you think its just another teeny slasher movie its not.  All people who want to be scared should see this!<br />A senior french class is going on a trip to paris, but one of the kids falls asleep and has a vision of the plane exploding.  He freaks out and some of the kids get thrown off the plane along with one teacher.  They are sittin gin teh airport mad at this kid when they see their plane take off and seconds later explodes.  They had cheated death........but not for long.  <BR>The great part about this movie is that its not a person stalking you, but its death itself.  It kills you in ways that look like freak accidents.  Another great part about this movie is that it doesnt concentrate on blood and guts but instead makes you wonder how death is choosing the order of the people to die (which is very creative).  This movie is thrilling, scary, and all around great.  Everyone should see it!
0452282152|5.0|I encourage you to curl up with this book at the end of the day!  This has become one of my all time favorite books!  It is well written, engaging, unique, thought provoking and beautiful.  Tracy Chevalier has a gift for describing settings and feelings that is rare.  It prompted me to visit the local art gallery in search of other Vermeer paintings so that I can experience first hand what was described in the book.  I was not disappointed!  I have read only one other book by Ms. Chevalier (Falling Angels) and it was equally eloquent and capativating.  I look forward to reading her other books in the future.  Susan Vreeland has also written a book about Vermeer, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, that was thoroughly enjoyable.  Other books I enjoyed are \\"Pope Joan\\", \\"The Red Tent\\", \\"Stones in the River\\", \\"Kite Runner\\", \\"Tapestries\\".  Happy reading.
B000002J0B|5.0|if I had to narrow it down anyhow!  The Rain Song is simply perfect.  Interesting set of song selections on this one, different sound ranges.
B00004Z459|5.0|\\"Hybrid Theory,\\" Linkin Park's multi-plat, uber-popular release is indeed a sweet album. But those with a more selective ear might feel guilty for enjoying such an album...although it's head-bangingly good and one of the best drive-fast-and-[angry] albums ever, \\"Theory\\" is extremely formulaic. <br />It's always the same: a low-key intro that sets the background melody, a quick strike of power chords, a return to the softer sound overlayed with either rapping or singing, then the main chorus accentuated by the grungy guitar again. For variation, throw in a bridge or a death metal scream session (i.e. \\"Shut up when I'm talking to you! Shut up!\\" or \\"I wanna run away...and never say good BYE!\\"). Rinse, lather, repeat. <br />The rapping and lyrics, aside from blips of sageness from \\"Forgotten,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" and \\"Papercut,\\" are also similar to each other, and don't display any truly masterful wordplay in the vein of true hip-hoppers like Jay-Z or Eminem. But the contrast between the cool, composed rap to the grating, pained vocals is beautifully noticeable, like an emotional split taking place in mid-song. <br />I could listen to this CD over and over (and I have)...but it feels a bit guilty, like picking on your little brother--sure it's fun, but it's just too easy. To get a different view of this album, try to find the acoustic versions present all over the Net, particularly one raw take on \\"Papercut.\\" <br />I can stand the formula for one more CD...I don't know about three.
B00004YRQA|4.0|I haven't saved anything on it yet (my mistake for buying a boring game...) but when I formatted it,(if I understood this right)it said it would only work on my system. This, in my opinion, might lesson the chances of it getting stolen. I gave it four stars because it costs alot.
B0000028M7|5.0|From the second that the jarring guitars and drums hit you in the first track, the brilliant, anguished \\"Them Bones\\", you get a good idea of what you're in for when you listen to this CD: a dark, heavy, unpretty view on the life of someone in their own private hell. And that's what makes it such a great album.<br />After the success of \\"Facelift\\", the late Layne Staley and company knew they had to work hard to create a worthy follow-up. And so they did. Sadly, Layne was struggling with a crippling drug addiction (which, unfortunately, would go on to claim his life). Thus the theme of the album: despair, depression, anger, etc. Some standout tracks include \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Dam That River\\" (which has a great riff), \\"Rain When I Die\\", \\"Sickman\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"God Smack\\" (which inspired another great band's name), and \\"Would?\\" (which, IMHO, is a brilliant song).<br />Alice In Chains was a great band, and Layne's legacy will live on through their music. Rest in peace, Layne, and thanks for everything.
B000002J09|4.0|Now, before you flame me for this, pretend Stairway to Heaven never existed and listen to everything else they've ever done.  The album certainly kicks ass, just don't base opinions on one song!  The intro is world class and unforgettable then it just goes.  It's not as full and soul-reaching as some of their other efforts, though.
B000089RVX|2.0|This is Linkin Park wearing a skirt ! It's unbelievable how people describe this record as coming from outer space, and bringing something new to the music scene ! How many groups of so-called &quot;Nu Metal&quot; you can quickly remember ? Just because Evanescence has a girl with the mic doesn't make it any better !<BR>Try CURVE instead !
B0000026WD|5.0|Dangerous is one MJ's best pieces of work. I love it but this album may not be suitable for both slow and fast music lovers 90% of the tracks are upbeat.

B000001FSU|4.0|In Joey Belladonna, Anthrax had one of the most distinctive singers in Thrash. The biggest problem with a voice as powerful and clean as Belladonna's was how the hell do you incorporate it into something as rough and ready as thrash? Well, it took the band three albums, but they finally hit the nail on the head with 'State Of Euphoria'.<br />Often criticised as Anthrax's weakest album, it is easy to see why many fans don't rate it. Production wise, it lacks the bite and punch of 'Spreading The Disease' and 'Among The Living', and is nowhere near as heavy as 'Persistence Of Time'. Scott Ian's signature rhythm guitar crunch has been strangled, and the drums are right up in the mix. It sounds like a bit of a mess, but it actually works, in an odd way.<br />Instead of the rhythm guitar leading the songs, as is more usual in Thrash, it's the vocals that point the songs in whatever direction they may be heading. Joey Belladonna's melodies shine through, and they are a pleasure to hear. Belladonna has an excellent vocal range and a clear voice, and easily pulls off a number of difficult passages and songs. Few other Thrash singers ever matched him, except perhaps Mark Oseguda from Death Angel.<br />The odd mix of the album make it far easier to appreciate Charlie Benante's drumming than on other Anthrax albums. While many Thrash fans worship Dave Lombardo and Gene Hoglan, Benante often ends up forgotten, rather unfairly.<br />Anthrax were called a band with a social conscience after previous songs like &quot;Indians&quot;, and that aspect of the band was further developed here. &quot;Who Cares Wins&quot; in particular examines the plight of the homeless, and how easy it is for those living comfortably to ignore. Elsewhere, they take a poke at money grabbing evangelists, on &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot;. While it's a tried and true, and clichéd, target now, it was innovative in 1988. Racism and prejudice also take a hit, with &quot;Schism&quot;.<br />Anthrax have always had adark sense of humour. The sarcasm through &quot;Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind&quot;, &quot;Finale&quot; and Make Me Laugh&quot; is biting. &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; is funny in it's own way too, based on the Stephen King novel 'Misery'.<br />While not as immediately likeable as other Anthrax albums, this does deserve repeated listens. If it's not heavy enough or the production is annoying, mess with your graphic equaliser until it's fixed. It is worth the effort.
B000002J1U|4.0|Still raw, bluesy and before superstardom.  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is a girl's best friend (if ya know what I mean).  (I've had a crush on Robert Plant since I can remember.  He just has that effect on me!)  The other songs are pretty folksy/rock and rambly.  You just gotta have it in your collection.
0966638328|5.0|how I manage to produce so beautiful color combinations without any (apparent) effort.<br />When I bought this book I was feeling somewhat skeptical but, together with Jim Krause's book on color combinations, it have saved me from the stress of spending hours to get the perfect color combination for my exhibition design projects.  <br />I converted the Pantone colors suggested in 4-color separations and printed them with our HP5000Ps.  I thought the results would be different but the combinations looked as beautiful as those in the book.<br />Thanks, thanks and more thanks!!!
B000069KIZ|5.0|Over the years, I have variously been told I would outgrow Brahms, or at least see his music move to the margins of my active repertoire of current musical interests. Fortunately, this has not yet happened to be the case. Instead, I have become ever more fascinated by the music, in which Schoenberg could discern the seeds of his New Music, and for which the dreaded conservative critic of Vienna, Hanslick, was wont to do battle against the tilting windmills of modernity in that turn- of-the-century epoch, especially those dragons of Wagnerism! To understand how such different cliques could have made such disparate, yet passionate use of Brahms as a key exhibit in their culture wars, one only has to listen .... again and again and again. Notoriously self-critical, Johannes made considerable efforts to present and publish only his best efforts in all genres of music. He only wrote four symphonies, but what distances other symphonists have traversed in nine, or more; it seems Brahms could compress into just four. The point of all this is that Brahms is a complicated composer who manages to draw upon much that is old, even traditional; while at the same time he strikes open into new horizons, new vistas, and above all new musics. Mozart is said to have bragged in his letters that his music had something for everyone: popular appeal for the common folk of his day, as well as formal schemes with complications and depths that probably only the highly trained musical cognoscenti would hear. Perhaps something equivalent must be also argued for Brahms' music. Thus, a conductor who succeeds in Brahms is by definition capable of discerning the old and the new, while preserving in passionate reserve the distinctiveness of Brahms's musical speech. The reissue of this set of performances of the Brahms symphonies merits our attention, because Karl Bohm was renowned in his own lifetime for being a prince of Mozartians. Given the evidence in this recorded set, he clearly was also among the most noble, and most notable, of Brahms conductors. Another part of the golden, glowing quality in these performances can only have come from the vaults of that other treasury, the Vienna Philharmonic. Brass, woodwinds, strings .... no one has quite the velvety depths of sound, as well as the mountainous granites of height and power, like the Vienna band. Karl Bohm was alleged to be quite demanding, to get what he wanted out of an orchestra; yet these recordings provide irrefutable proof that both he and the orchestra could be united in musical warmth and intimacy with the challenging demands of Brahms four symphonies. Even a somewhat stiff, foursquare, formally reserved quality that sometimes arises momentarily in these performance, every so slightly apparent in moments of transition in the keys, as the musical narrative shifts and transforms within the musical structure, would itself be quite true to what we know of Brahms as a human being. You find yourself musing that surely Karl Bohm had some of those same, authentically gruff and rough-hewn qualities himself, not too glowing nor too proud or polished to be capable of reminding us in his musical manner that Brahms played piano in the waterfront establishments of Hamburg. Now those musical patrons were neither typically noble-born, nor replete with necessities much beyond those of working-class survival. These recordings are classics, and have merited praise since their first release. Mention must also be made of alto Christa Ludwig's Alto Rhapsody, along with the burnished Viennese sounds of the male chorus that accompanies her. Sorrow, regret, and transcendently spiritualized resignation go hand in hand in her performance of this odd work. Brahms said himself that he believe it to be one of the best things he had ever prayed. Hearing all, surely we agree. Get this set now. With the marketing kids running the show, it can just as easily disappear from the catalogue as it so quickly arrived. Highly, highlyrecommended.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This 2-disc DVD set contains 5 and a half hours of Led Zeppelin live, and a few interviews w/ the band. The performances are of the highest calibre, and it shows why Led Zeppelin is so legendary and influential. They were enigmatic, as they were fun. They were exciting as they were unbeliveable. Simply put: music would not be the same w/out Led Zeppelin.<br />The first DVD contains the Royal Albert Hall performance (1970), a promo of &quot;Communication Breakdown,&quot; and several live television performances. This was the band during their primitive stages, but even then, you knew that they were amazing and would go on to conquer the world. The second DVD, containing performances from 1973-1979, shows a band already established, having every album go platinum, having every show sold out, still performing their greatest songs live with the same charisma and passion as they did during their 1968-1969 era when they first formed. Since their breakup, their live shows only chronicled by the Song Remains the Same, at least legally, their live performances have become the fodder for myths and legends. This DVD set brings the legend to life, and still inspires many who weren't born when Zeppelin was around or never got a chance to see their prowess in concert. This is a must own for any Zeppelin fan.
B000002JSN|4.0|Someone said &quot;Stairway to Heaven is the greatest song Led Zeppelin ever did&quot; my reply was &quot;then you haven't listened to much Zeppelin&quot;.  Some of their best stuff is on this album.  Real deep/soul-reaching stuff and a nice array for selections.
0316191299|5.0|Possibly my favorite book of all time, Holidays on Ice is Sedaris' best book.  Each story will have you literaly laughing out loud.
B00001IVOR|5.0|as i was reading these reviews, i came across some that's just so totally wrong. i honestly don't know how a CD can get ANY better. quite possibly the best wu cd ever.  Disc 1 is DEFINATELY better than the 2nd, and the 2nd CD blows ANY recent album out of the water. In a double cd there is only 1 or POSSIBLY 2 songs i would skip over (black shampoo being the only one i'd def. skip over)
B000096I9G|4.0|I hated to use that made up term, but seriously, you must be a Cure fan for this one. Typical of any Live album as the sound is often muddled due to the overwhelming chorus coming out of the home theater! You should treat yourself, Cure Fan, to a night with the lights down, sipping your favorite indugence, allowing yourself to be swept away by the truly powerful work contained in this DVD. Robert Smith proves that he is truly an artist and poet. The production is well done, the lighting is exellent, and the only negative is the sound quality in some numbers. Also detracting is the fact that live numbers often are different then the original recording, but if you know the song, you won't care. Robert's voice may be slightly &quot;off key&quot; to some ears, but if it is, you just aren't that devoted of a fan. Thank You Robert for this one!
B00006G8G1|4.0|This is a good dvd of a great concert. The set list is fantastic. A good representation of old and new Maiden. Bruce Dickinson has more energy than any other frontman I've seen.The sound quality was very good on my system, however, the video editing [stunk] bigtime! I can't believe a guitar player edited the video for this dvd. The camera was never on the lead guitarist during leads. They must have used 1000 cameras to film this video because they changed to a different camera every second for the whole concert. It was annoying. I've been a big Maiden fan since the first album and have seen them live many times. I wish the video was as good as the music.
B000001EUL|2.0|With the departure of Ulrich Roth, the Scorpions underwent a dramatic and obvious change of style - from unique and non-commercial to blatantly commercial.  Nothing wrong with commercial (if it's good), but clearly the guys had not yet found the refined sound of such albums as Blackout and Love at First Sting.  The only good songs on this album are the title track and Loving You Sunday Morning; the rest are either sleepy ballads or run of the mill &quot;rockers&quot;, all noise with no melody.  Simply put, LOVEDRIVE is a lousy effort except for two songs.  The previous album Taken by Force presents a far more interesting format with less obvious commercialism.  Don't waste your time with this one - you're not missing much.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This has go to be the best CD I bought in a very long, time.  I just got into Manson no more than two weeks ago and own four of his cd's and this is by far THE BEST.  Reason I like this Album so much more than his others is that it sounds so different and unique.  Only thing I don't recommend is listening to this after you spit up with a girlfriend, tends to be very depressing, such as the song Tourniquet, can really do ya in.  But o well I still recommend this album to anybody that likes something a lil' different and excellent.
0553579908|5.0|&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is the second volume of a planned six-part series, &quot;The Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. It is a book about treason, love, friendship, death, war, power, incest, knowledge, magic and spirituality. Set in a cunningly and all-too realistic world which reminds the reader of Medieval times, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; follows the story told in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, where we meet the heraldry of the Seven Kingdoms, some of which is now fighting for the iron throne. You will find characters you will love, you will find characters you will most assuredly hate, and you will certainly find characters you will not know what to think of. <br />George R. R. Martin weaves a tale of an incredible, bloody world, which bears more resemblance to authentic historical times than one might be ready to admit. The characters are not black-and-white. In the beginning you might think you know who the bad guys and who the good guys are, but as you continue reading, you won't be so sure. Moreover, you will not see happy endings for many of the characters. You will suffer, you will cry, you will hate and you will love. In this series, no one is safe from fate's cruel hand. You will not find yourself reading about the typical battle between good and evil. Instead, you will read the most refreshing series to come in modern times, with the most incredible and three-dimensional characters you might encounter in fantasy novels and the most imaginative storyline you might wish to find.<BR> <BR>I especially liked the different point of views (POV's) used in the book, each a new chapter. It allows the reader to know a few different characters, seeing and feeling things through their eyes and hearts, while being in the dark about some things, which is exactly why the author uses these limited POV's. He does not wish us to know more than we should. <br />The plot is amazing. I thought the author could not top &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, but this second volume is as good, if not better, than the previous. This series will go far, for it is masterfully written, poignantly told, and incredibly real. Not your run-of-the-mill fantasy setting either. That's why I loved it.<BR> <BR>When I finished this book I wanted to cry, scream, curse, laugh, shoot the author, read the next one immediately... this book provoked so many reactions in me while I read it that I ended up an emotional wreck. This story will do this to you. This book will make you wish you had picked it up a long time ago, because you can't think why, in the name of all that's sacred, you hadn't read it before.<BR> <BR>In the end, this book made me feel a complete emotional wreck. I found myself feeling more emotions reading a single chapter of this book than many others I have read in the past. Hope, anxiety, fear, loathing, laughter, horror, revulsion, pain... these are some of the feelings that you will experience while reading this book.<BR> <BR>This is a book I recommend heartily. Start with &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and then read this one. When you're over, jump towards the next one, and then the next, and then... you get the point. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JLXE|1.0|I found this movie to be a complete disappointment.  Ben Affleck is good at chasing lesbians, but being the infamous Daredevil.... I think not.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|A good but not great live performance - 3 1/2 stars would actually be the most accurate rating.  Two pointless and ear-grating Elvis fillers and a sappy Japanese folk song are the weak points, but overall excellent guitar playing and decent song selection. Recommended if you want to hear Scorps before they sold out with Lovedrive and all their other typically commercial albums from the '80's.  Check out UFO's STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT for hard rock's ultimate live album.
0684857219|4.0|This book has a TON of information packed into it and you definitely can't beat the price.  Not only does it answer all your questions, but the book is an excellent motivator to get off your butt and go work out, it has inspired me to take up bodybuilding as a new sport as well.  The only problem that I found with this book is that it does not address overtraining as a serious issue.  I believe that the workout schedule in this book CAN lead to overtraining and I have been lifting for 4 years and have very mature muscles.  Despite this fact, it is an excellent book, I just recommend reading some other literature along with it to get an idea of how to set up your work out splits to avoid overtraining.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I really enjoy every track on this cd.  Jack White's skills on guitar and writing are always great.  They know how to rock and they know who they are and they will continue to make music.  It is all about the music with this band.  I own all four albums and this is their best but they have never put out anything that made me want to puke.  They know the market know with their success and with this lyric about a girl, &quot;I never said i was the heir to a fortune, I never claimed to have any looks. Because somebody ripped out my page in your telephone book.&quot;  These guys would never get their publicity if it wasnt for other bands but they simply know that and they continue to make good music.  Dont knock it, your not that angry are you?  Why should you be?  Are you afraid that your indie/punk rock friends will find the mainstream album elephant in your 500 dollar cd player full of compilations that are each worth 3 bucks.  Listen to music.  As much as you can.  Listen to The White Stripes' Elephant.
B000069AUI|5.0|Unless you compare Coldplay's most recent albulm with Radiohead's 'The Bends', there is not much similar.<br />Coldplay's recent albulm, however, is better than its predecessor. There are no standout songs like Yellow, but overall, A Rush of Blood to the Head dominates Parachutes. Believe you me. I found 90% of the songs on this cd immensely enjoyable, playing them over and over again.  Melodic and very well constructed, Coldplay has surpassed other UK groups like Cranberries and Oasis and moved in amongst the greats like U2 and Radiohead. They are here and they're for real. If you enjoyed songs like U2's Beautiful Day, Where the Streets Have No Name and Radiohead's Plastic Trees and Nice Dream, this cd is absolutely worth the buy.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Top rate show for fans of prohibition era ganster films and fans of Gabriel Byrne. I've seen &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; with a lot of different crowds and it's never failed to entertain and impress.
B000092ZYX|5.0|It is a combination between the last few albums but completely different from what they have done in the past.  It is music, real music.  People must listen to understand.  How can you not like Radiohead?  This album is good for whatever mood i am in.  It is by far the best cd purchase so far this year for me.  I sometimes think that great bands nowadays put out records  for the music aspect instead of thinking about what people think or what the critique is about.  It really stinks when a stinker puts down an album for reasons that arent focused on the album.  Our brains are precious and Radiohead knows this along with some others and they are a &quot;lucky&quot; band but we are more fortunate because like every album, we can progress too.  I'm still in awe of how wonderful it is to have access to a band like radiohead and to have them put out another record.  As a musician i know this increases my ability to write better material and to understand it at the same time.  Maybe im bias being a musician and appreciating this more than just a consumer but if you have a keen imagination for music,sounds, writing or art then this a good purchase.  It should not be ingnored because it is NEW!  In my opinion Radiohead is a much better band now then when they started.  They dont have any obligations and why should they?  Always moving forward and never getting stale.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B000002HPT|5.0|This is a really excellent album by a really excellent band. Not quite as technical as most of their other albums(&quot;Awake&quot;, &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;), but is that really a bad thing? To me, it seems like they stopped trying to impress everyone with their skills and instead created a listening experience halfway between technical progressive rock and more traditional rock n' roll.<br />&quot;New Millenium&quot; is an excellent song with a great bass rhythm, signature keyboards that this band is famous for, and the same with the guitars.<br />&quot;You Not Me&quot; is a much more traditional rock song in the sense that the lyrics aren't about anything that could show up on the front page of the newspaper and that the guitars and bass are the most prominent part of the song.<br />&quot;Peruvian Skies&quot; is a cool song with a very laid back, but somehow sinister guitar rhythm. <br />&quot;Hollow Years&quot; should really have been a single(maybe it is and I just don't know about it). I would say it's better than their only single(that I know about) &quot;Another Day&quot;. It's a somber song about suicide.<br />&quot;Burning My Soul&quot; is a heavy song. Not that spectacular, but not that bad either.<br />&quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; isn't very hellish. The name still makes me laugh. This isn't a very powerful or &quot;evil&quot; piece. It's instrumental, and very good, but it sounds way too mellow and nice for the name.<br />&quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; is possibly the album's best song. It's progressive, but not too technical. James LaBrie's vocals are spectacular throughout the entire 12 minutes. It has a great bass groove and a kickass guitar solo. Slow and catchy for most of the middle of it, it ends with a roaring duet by James LaBrie and Doug Pinnick of &quot;King's X&quot;.<br />&quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; is a melodic piece with more great vocals by James LaBrie. And again, it has a great guitar solo in it.<br />&quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; sounds more like a U2 song when it first starts than anything. But it quickly becomes apparent it's not. This is a lot more technical than the rest of the album and sounds like it could be on &quot;Images and Words&quot; if it wanted to be.<br />&quot;Anna Lee&quot; is a slow piece that has more piano in it than anything. Very melodic.<br />&quot;Trial of Tears&quot; is the epic conclusion to the album. Seperated into three parts, it's pretty good but I think &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; would have been a better finale piece. Again, there is a lot of groovin' bass in the second part, and I like that. The last part is probably the best. &quot;The Wasteland&quot; is slow and has great vocal harmonies.<br />All in all, this album has a more commercial feel to it. But not so much that they sell out. No, I feel this album is one of their best because they focus more on creating an awesome sound than on creating a complex one. This is easily my first or second favorite Dream Theater album. The only one that can compare is &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory&quot;. And even that one gets a run for its money.
0201485672|5.0|After a year of OOP with C#, I finally feel that I'm writing some well written code with the help of Martin Fowler's Refactoring.  Fowler defines a number of &quot;smells&quot; indicating areas of your code that may need refactoring.  He then offers clear and concise methods for clearing the smells; resulting in more extensible and understandable code.  This book is great for learning refactoring and as a quick reference...it should be found on every OOP developer's bookshelf.
0201633612|5.0|I came across this classic pretty innocuously. Some colleagues suggested a design patterns study group and from that day I was hooked. This book teaches you more about Object Oriented programming than all the other OO books combined.<BR>Each pattern opens up another facet of Object Oriented programming. Once you are done with all the patterns, and then, done with them again, and then, done with them again you feel the euphoria of having understood something so abstract, but at the same time so tangible and visible around us. Be it Java, C++ or any other OO language, your design ideas and orgranizations become incredibly elegant and simple. This, is something you learn and appreciate only if you have gone through this book. And, here, by &quot;done with them&quot;, I mean a thorough study, sample implementations, production implementations and the ability to recognize that pattern with its subtle variations. <BR>The GoF book ( Gang of Four ) is structured as a manual of sorts, and it requires some orderly study. Look up Design Patterns Study Group on Google. The study orders suggested there are worth mulling over. The simple patterns are easy enough to understand ( Factory method and the like ) and the complex ones ( Visitor ) can be digested with the understanding of the basic patterns. <BR>Again, at the end of the book, ( there is so end to this book, though ) you might actually end up mastering OO coding. <BR>Couple of possible criticisms on this book is that you begin to think in patterns for every problem. Which might not be entirely good, and this book doesnt encompass the full world of pure OO patterns ( collecting parameter, for example ). But its still THE book to start with.<BR>It also helps that this book has become a standard of sorts and the terms and jargon presented in this book are highly visible in the OO design and programming world. <BR>Worth a Buy, Worth a dozen reads.
0780625129|5.0|Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is released from prison to find his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) caught in the same web of racism and hatred that landed him in prison.  The movie centers around Derek, a man who has gone through experiences in his life that have led to him becoming an extremely hateful racist and anti-semitist. His father being shot by a black man is what sparks the change in him and his anger drives his life to a Neo-Nazi world that he ultimately ends when he murders two black men. His experiences in prison make him realize how much of his life he has wasted and his new goal in life is to save his brother from taking the same wrong path he did.
B00005QDW5|3.0|After hearing Echoes there's little doubt they forgot what this song is. Completely desfigured, it was transformed from a contemporary masterpiece to nothing, all the subtleties are gone, left just a dumb pasteurized sound. The arousing finale simply cut, all the dissonant chords and less obvious melodies are missing, there's nothing in this which resembles the original. Even with his 23 minutes, Echoes was the best song of Pink Floyd. I don't know what it is, a 16-minute unrecognizable pop-prog, if anything. The rest of the cd gets better, interestingly enough when the newer songs couples better with this producing style.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Nunca habia visto un concierto de Iron Maiden, y este dvd me ha dado una idea sorprendente de lo que son en directo. Una gran calidad, un buen montaje, y sobre todo un sonido que es como si lo estuvieras viviendo en el mismisimo Rio.
0441003257|5.0|I've read this almost as many times as I've read the Tolkein trilogy, that's how much I enjoy it.  Pratchett and Gaiman are masters of their craft and I find myself reaching for this book whenever world politics is getting too serious and puritanical (which is quite often these days).  It's similar in tone to Douglass Adams, so if you enjoyed Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you'll enjoy this.  And if you've read other Gaiman or other Pratchett works (or both) then you will enjoy reading the story these two melded together.  My copy is so worn now, I might have to get a new one myself, even though this one was signed by Neil Gaiman....
0385504209|5.0|I've read thousands of thirllers but this one set itself apart by not just feeding my mind with twists and turns of a plot line, but with a truly interesting underlying story.  I do not fancy myself a conspiracy theory fan, but I have to admit this one lit my fire.  The author keeps us interested by feeding us his story on three different levels.  There is the mystery of the past, the puzzles left by the victim found in the early pages, and the chase for our heros lives throughout the book.  The book takes us through the ages, in and out of the church, through cities and countries.  Rarely has a book so peaked my interest.  In the end, I found myself on the internet doing research about DaVinci and the Holy Grail - not something I have ever thought about before.  I seriously recomend this book.
0385504209|4.0|This book was very engaging and interesting. It is definitely not your typical suspense thriller. Although it did tend to get a little slow during the middle part of the book, the ending had a nice twist. The detail that the author goes into with respect to the secret societies and art history was very very interesting. These inclusions made for a much more interesting book - especially for someone who is interested in art history or history in any capacity. I would have liked to have known how much of the details and story is true, however, because at some points in the story the claims that the author makes seem completely unreal. All in all, this was an excellent quick read and I would recommend it to anyone!
B00003CWLF|1.0|Wow...this dvd buries the EPIC genre further with Chow Yun Fat's horrible attempt at charm and Foster's endless delivery of lines through pursed lips....good costumes though...I recommend a rental below is what I think about the origins of this film.<br />Leonowens will never realize how she has condemned an entire nation with her lies.  True, Thais do revere their kings and do not see them as being human.  However, in the case of King Mongkut you have a truly remarkable man, do your homework before making judgements, and keep in mind that Leonowens was exposed to common Thai people most of the time but instead chose to write about the royalty to make $$$.  I am truly saddened that King Mongkut a highly tolerant and far sighted ruler must stand in the shadow of lies.  I challenge you to research western sources regarding this man.  I agree that Thailand should not ban these films or books because they reveal how the West (whom they have always admired) regards them in the 19th century and even today.  The fact that no modern scholar has come forth to introduce King Mongkut to the world has burdened Thais to rightfully defend themselves and in doing so make Leonowen's account seem hilariously &quot;unbiased&quot;.
0671027387|5.0|Unbelievably good. Out-Crichtons Michael. Out-Clanceys Tom. What a brillliant mind. First Dan Brown builds a fantastic hypothesis and then slowly undoes it. This man should work for the CIA, he is such a brain! This is a terrific story about how NASA falls on its own sword. The characters are well drawn, the women especially. The inside workings of politics is a fun story. How can one writer know so much? One of the best thrillers I have read in several years. Every chapter is a cliff-hanger. When a NASA satellite in the Arctic discovers a meteorite buried deep in a glacier, the foundering Agency grabs the publicity to save it from being voted out of existence by dollar-hungry senators and representatives. The president is also in need of a something to boost his sagging polls. This looks like the life-saver, until it begins to look like a gigantic hoax. And on top of that, someone is willing to kill, and does murder several scientists, in orer to prevent exposure. You won't be able to put this down, once you start it. A high-concept novel, yet thoroughly believeable.
0385504209|4.0|This book is fun and fast-paced and very intriguing, but don't take it too seriously.  While the author has clearly done his research and reveals many truths that some readers may not be familiar with, there are parts of the plot which are based more on hokey conspiracy theories than on real history.  Keep in mind that you're reading a work of fiction, albeit one with a great deal of solid fact supporting the story, and youll enjoy it.  If youre interested in the topics that Dan Brown brings up, such as the real story of Mary Magdelene, the near eradication of the sacred feminine in Western culture, and the truth about Opus Dei, then do your own research and reach your own conclusions.  In the meantime, read this book and enjoy it for what its meant to be and remember, \\"the things you is liable to read in the Bible, they ain't necessarily so.\\"
B00005JM09|5.0|This movie is by far the best movie made this year... I think have a women as the bad terminator is a very good idea. She does a fabulous job acting a long with Arnold. This movie is friggin halarious and the action sceens are amazing and realistic. I like that in this terminator movie, they really prove that the 2 robots are machines. The other one they mainly use the idea that they can withstand bullets to show that they are robots. In this one, they damage a car if they jump on it, they break concreate if they fall on the ground, arnold bends metal with ease. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE AND I HAVE SEEN IT 4 TIMES in the theatures...
1573229725|5.0|As in Sarah Waters first two novels, \\"Fingersmith\\" once again gives us a close view of the seamier side of life in London during Victorian times ? this time we make the acquaintance of a den of thieves & pickpockets among the dregs of society and get a glimpse of the world of pornography & kinky inclinations for gentlemen.  This author is an expert at plot twists and surprises which really shock the reader, allow yourself uninterrupted time for this book, it is a real page turner, melodramatic, a love story, a murder/crime thriller and great historical fiction.<br />There are so many twist and turns to this story that I find it hard to say much about it without revealing crucial parts of the plot. The main characters are 2 orphans, Maud and Sue, that have grown up leading vastly different lives and are brought together in their late teens.  At the beginning we are introduced to Sue and the family of thieves she lives among at the house of Mrs. Sucksby.  Sue is presented with a mission by Mrs. Sucksby?s friend whom she calls ?Gentleman? ?  The plan, in brief,  is that Gentleman will  marry an orphaned, isolated heiress then have her locked up in an asylum, stealing her money, Sue will pose as the lady?s maid and assist Gentleman in making his wife appear insane.  And that is all I will say.<br />I look forward to rereading this one day to look out for all the little clues I missed the first time.
0451163532|3.0|This is an absolutely true story of how some people working for Ross Perot at EDS were imprisoned in Iran and how the escaped.  But, you know, sometimes true stories are not as interesting or suspenseful as fiction.<br />The introduction of the characters and the build up of the story are very well done.  It is just that the escape was anticlimatic and not very exciting.<br />Other reveiwers make it sound like Ross Perot was a super hero, doing the impossible to rescue his workers.  On Perot's side, he was very concerned for his people and took actions to try to help them.  But, he wasn't involved in the actual rescue.  He hired mercanaries to do the actual work.<br />It turns out that there was really no rescue.  The captives escaped the prison on their own.  The only thing the mercenaries supplied was transporation to the border.  It made it easier for the people to get out of Iran, but they probably could have done it on their own.<br />This book would have been more interesting if it concentrated even more on the captives and gave less attention to Perot and the mercenaries.  In that way, there would have been a lot more suspense and the ending would have had a better pay off.<br />This is not a bad book.  The development of the characters is very good.  And there is some tension when the captives are sent to prison.  It's just there is no big action filled pay off in the end.
B00003CXXR|4.0|I know that when I go to see a summer blockbuster movie, I cannot expect deep explorations of philosophical themes... it is just fun, and it eventually just comes down to how much do you like certain stereotypes and hate others. There is no difference whatsoever between this movie and others like The Rock, Armageddon, Batman, Spiderman, ID4 etc,etc,etc. They are all just made to entertain as many people as possible. So I don't really care if they made up a dinosaur for this movie (Spinosaur was actually a dinosaur... the one they made up a little bit for the movie was the Pteranodon, which was not like they showed it in the movie)... I just care enough to get into the movie. I liked its quick pace, I loved the character of Alan Grant, and I enjoyed seeing Tea Leoni hanging from a tree while two raptors try to reach her, as much as I enjoyed William H. Macy's clumsyness. I was so thankful that Ian Malcolm and his annoying daughter were not back almost as much as I was about the T-Rex staying in the island and eventually dying. The one big gap is not if the telephone could be heard from the belly of the dinosaur or if the military answer was too quick... the gap in this movie is simply that it is too short... It lacks one more act, a more entertaining conclusion and a couple of other deaths. What I enjoyed particularly was the crash scene until the T-Rex/Spinosaur fight, the image of the raptors running through the planes (they could have played more with these kind of images and frames) and, above all, the birdcage scene. It was fantastic, very well cut and that's the action I like to see... people running through strange enviroments and moving all around it (they start way up, a bridge, an aereal capture, parasailing, falling to the river, runnning between cliffs, etc). Well, these are the stereotypes I like to see in a blockbuster summer movie (not the world being collapsed by a rock that comes from outer space, nor Will Smith saying I make this look good or Bill Pullman: today we celebrate our independence day, puaghhh!): people being chased by huge digital or mechanical teeth, while falling, burning, exploding, etc. The stars up in the beginning od this review are not the same kind of other of my reviews. I liked this movie, I enjoyed it a lot... but in the end of the day, this is not a movie I'll be thinking much about in other terms than its own plot twists and roars.<BR>Just enjoy it... if you like this kind of entertainment.
0609610570|5.0|Normally, if you accuse someone of having an \\"astonishing grasp of the obvious\\" it's an insult. But in the case of the two authors of this book, it's meant to be the highest praise possible. Perhaps because sometimes what seems \\"obvious\\" is the hardest thing for people to grasp.<BR> Which is exactly what Mssrs. Bossidy and Charan demonstrate in this phenomenal book. First, by making the obvious point that how a business \\"executes\\" or \\"gets things done\\" as they put it, is critical to its success. And then, why so many businesses find this so difficult to do with any regularity. While admitting that \\"execution\\" may not sound as sexy as \\"strategy\\", \\"globalization\\" or \\"mergers & acquisitions\\", the authors make an airtight case for the fact that absent execution no company is going to get far. And that execution is, in fact, a discipline unto itself with its own specific set of behaviors and techniques.<BR> And starting with the 7 essential behaviors of a business leader, it becomes quite obvious why execution is so difficult: It's hard, and it takes a lot of character and self-confidence to pull it off. It requires a relentless and almost ruthless questioning of every business initiative-getting at the genuine nitty, gritty details of the what's and how's. It demands tenacious follow-through, rigorous accountability. And at all times, a willingness to acknowledge that everyone, from the vaunted CEO on down, may be dead wrong. Not surprisingly, these behaviors have to be built into the fabric of a company's culture and protected from any assault.<BR> Bossidy and Charan know what they're talking about. The map they provide is clear enough. And the perils of straying from it painfully illustrated. What they can't provide is the sheer integrity necessary to face truth, which is job #1 when it comes to executing. (Something the latest spate of scandals would seem to indicate is not available in abundance at many corporations these days.) A very important, and great book.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Disney's 28th animated feature brims with the richness of imagination and the magic of an outstanding musical score. This Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, though not quite true to the original, is uniquely retold through enchanting Disney animation. At a time when animation was dying a slow death, a beautiful mermaid with a soulful voice made her appearance on the silver screen and won the heart of millions.<br />                         Sixteen-year old Ariel dreams of life on the land, although her father, the sea-king Triton does not approve of the human race, branding them as `savage harpooning fish-eaters'. However as fate would have it, Ariel catches her first glimpse of the very handsome prince Eric and falls devotedly in love with him after saving his life during a raging sea storm. Her obsessive yet true love compels her to sell her voice to the sea-witch Ursula for three days as a human, within which Eric has to kiss her lips in `the kiss of true love'.<BR> <BR>                      The animation is rich in color and texture. Incomplete cels are hardly noticeable. The backgrounds are lush and vivid and the character sketching blends a traditional style with modern details. Ariel is still the prettiest Disney heroine; her facial expressions beautifully conveying her emotions. She is Glenn Keane's best creation till date. Eric is the bland Disney hunk; his drop-dead gorgeous looks and serious expressions sobered by boyish grins easily make him the most favorite Disney heartthrob (thanks to Mark Henn). Andreas Deja, well known for villains like Scar (from The Lion King) and Jafar (from Aladdin), was the supervising animator for Triton and Duncan Marjoribanks does an excellent job of portraying the character of Sebastian.  <BR>               <BR>               The music, which was one of the last collaborative efforts of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, is profoundly magnificent. The Oscar-winning score is rich in musical and orchestral beauty, `TheJig' and `The Storm' being the most memorable sequences. Menken's enchanting and emotional score provides a new dimension to the movie. It has a certain magic to it that I find absent in his later scores (like Aladdin and more recently, Hercules). The songs, which vary from the haunting `Part Of Your World' to the Caribbean styled `Kiss The Girl', are wonderfully composed. `Under The Sea' is an excellent number which won the Oscar as the best song of 1989.<br />                 The voice talent is very praiseworthy and unlike later animation movies, it does not include a host of celebrities. Jodi Benson simply stands out as Ariel and her vocal performances will move you.  Pat Carroll shows her talent as the villainous Ursula. Christopher Daniel Barnes' deep yet boyish voice suits Prince Eric perfect. Kenneth Mars and Jason Marin will be well loved in their roles as King Triton and Flounder. The best role in the movie is that of Samuel E. Wright, who renders an outstanding performance as the voice of Sebastian.<BR>                      <BR>                    All in all, a true classic that offers something for the entire family. Filled with crisp fun and entertainment, the movie highlights the value and meaning of true love and sacrifice, conveying its emotional meaning in a marvelous way. It truly touches your heart, the sad parts making you cry and the comical parts making you laugh. <br />                    The DVD however does not do justice to this masterpiece. The non-anamorphic transfer is grainy and non-satisfactory. The colors look bright (specially the red), but the dark sequences of the film suffer from pixelisation and non-restoration.  The audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) is good, though I feel that the DD mix does not properly highlight the score or make adequate use of the rear sound. Furthermore, there is no special feature whatsoever on the Disc. I strongly criticize Disney for presenting such a spectacular movie in such an artless manner. This movie holds a very special place in my heart and I am eagerly waiting for the October 2008 platinum re-release of the DVD, which, I hope like the recent two-Disc Disney releases, will provide the quality I yearn for.

0375758992|4.0|This is the story of growing up white in 1970s Africa - hard scrabble farming, misery, family eccentricity seeming normal when you don't know any different. 'Bobo' (Fuller) survives when other siblings don't, somethign that turns her mother from a funny drunk into a mad and morose drunk. Her mother is one of the most interesting and powerful characters to feature in a book full of interesting characters.<br />This is an interesting story, well told, about growing up white and poor in post-Independance Africa (they move through various countries) but it seems to be missing a certain 'something' - joy perhaps, or just a let up? That is the problem with real life narratives sometimes - they don't always read as well as fiction. But this book is interesting and well worth the read never the less.<br />Finding a lifestyle and livelihood in desperation has become a cliched theme in books right now (blame the success of 'Angela's Ashes') but this book transends most of that genre.
0316666343|5.0|No review that I have yet read truly encompasses the power of this novel.  Reading the dust jacket actually made me put this aside for a while, but the first chapter pulled me firmly into the story.  This is an amazingly well-written work, enjoyable to the last page.
0312305060|4.0|This is the story of three women - Virginia Woolf; Mrs Brown, and 1950s housewife; and Clarissa, a book editor in the 1990s. The story is told in alternating vignettes, the connecting thread being the book 'Mrs Dalloway'. It builds slowly, carefully building the ties that bind these three very different women.<br />In places the writing is *very* self-conciously trying and pretentious, almost unbearably so. It redeems itself, however, with some beautiful stand alone sentences, and especially the wonderfully captured sense of despair and futility felt by Laura Brown. <br />The obvious literary style is infuriating at times, but there are some passages of true beauty, and the three seperate lives work well. This book is worth reading if well written prose is what you are after.
1573229725|3.0|I know i am not going to win many friends by giving this book only three stars, but each to their own.....<br />this book started *so* well - a Dickensian style story based in Victorian England, it tells the tale of Sue, who leaves the den of theives she has grown up in to live in a Manor House as maid to an odd girl whom is to be tricked out of her fortune.Unfortunately, Sue comes to feel for her mistress, but is trapped in a plot to undo her. To tell more would be to give the plot away. But so far, so good. This is about the first third of the book.<br />Then we read the story from the point of view of the other girl, Maud. We learn of her bizarre past, which i don't think i am giving too much away by saying it includes mad houses, an eccentric Uncle and erotic literature.<br />In the final third the plot gets very convoluted - it includes babies swapped at birth among other melodramatic turns. I continued to read to see if the book would live up to its promising start, but it never does, which is a pity. And the ending is very pat and boring. In general, it is over long and too melodramatic.<br />There are some plusses - it manages to avoid some pit-falls of over dramatic writing, and the sex is written in a non-cringeworthy manner.
B00005JLZN|4.0|This film had some very intriquing elements to it. Kate Winslet was solid and Kevin Spacey was excellent. The direction by Alan Parker gave it the eerie elements that keep you uneasy throughout. However, as the story unfolds it becomes somewhat predictable where it is heading. This cheapens the ending but the film is still worth seeing.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I will have to agree with some of the people here that this was indeed a good soundtrack.  I enjoyed the movie and the music from it and couldn't wait to get the soundtrack.  However, upon listening to it I was slighty disappointed in discovering its extreme shortness.<br />As pointed out in other reviews, its only 45 Minutes long.  45 minutes worth of music for a movie that was well over 2 hours and 20 minutes is a travesty.  I would have loved to been able to listen to the music from various fight scenes and the end credits over again, but alas it will not be so, unless Disney releases a better longer version (which I hope they do).<br />Being a Soundtrack Lover, I feel what is on the CD really packs a punch.  Those 45 minutes flew by and I was captivated by Bladet's orchestrations.  I just wish I could have been captivated for 30 more minutes.
B00009NH5W|5.0|TTD is back.  I'm struggling with the thought that this latest offering by TTD might be better than ...Hardline.  The voice is as dynamic as ever but with a more definitive edge if that's possible.  It's unfortunate that we may never hear this incredible cd on the radio or see a video on MTV, BET, or VH1.  Mavericks don't get to play with the other horses.  I will not rate any songs because they are all of equal strength.  If you like rock, R &amp; B, Urban, or Cool-Out music you won't be lost on this CD.  This will be the best CD you never heard.  Get this one today.
B00005JLTN|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded is a good film, let no-one dissuade you, but it has detractors, and for good reason. Many people who saw this film didn't see in it what they might have expected, based on what the got with the first film. \\"More of the same\\" is one possibility that these people may have had in mind, but that doesn't mean that the film on the whole should be avoided, just taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Some key points:<br />1] The \\"Zion rave\\" is probably the one big reason so many people hate this film. True, it's rather unnecessary, but at least it doesn't last too long.<br />2] As with the Japanese anime .hack, the current section of the Matrix series is a multimedia experience. There are plot points and characters you simply will not find acceptable unless you immerse yourself in the saga. To that end, you will get more out of the story if you see \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" and \\"Kid's Story\\" on the Animatrix DVD, and perhaps play the Enter the Matrix videogame, as all of these things introduce plot elements that tie into the main story. (Speaking of the Kid: many people complain about his presence too, but he's actually not in the film long enough to make that much of a difference.)<br />3] The philosophy of the series may become harder and harder to swallow as things go along, but it is good to have a film that challenges some part of your intelligence and actually gets you to think a little. Action is not the be-all-end-all of this storyline.<br />4] I've noted those who mention the inconsistencies in the clothing of the dwellers of Zion, but this too is minor. At least there's a sign that they actually have a textile operation down there. And that they wear sunglasses all the time in the Matrix is merely the Wachowski brothers' fashion statement.<br />Despite points like these and others, you shouldn't keep yourself from seeing The Matrix Reloaded if you already saw the first film. \\"Free your mind\\", as the line goes. And if you can, see this filmin IMAX; it's big and good, despite the fact that it's not in true IMAX format (more like a letterboxed image on a regular TV screen, even if it is much bigger). At least it isn't cut like the IMAX version of Star Wars: Episode II was.
B000092ZYX|4.0|If I had to put together only one audio CD worth of Radiohead tracks as a favorites disc, it would probably be these:<br />1. Creep (Pablo Honey)<BR>2. High and Dry (The Bends)<BR>3. Fake Plastic Trees (The Bends)<BR>4. Bones (The Bends)<BR>5. Nice Dream (The Bends)<BR>6. Just (The Bends)<BR>7. My Iron Lung (The Bends)<BR>8. Bulletproof...I Wish I Was (The Bends)<BR>9. 2+2=5 (Hail to the Thief)<BR>10. There There (Hail to the Thief)<BR>11. The National Anthem (Kid A)<BR>12. Paranoid Android (OK Computer)<BR>13. Let Down (OK Computer)<BR>14. No Surprises (OK Computer)<BR>15. Knives Out (Amnesiac)<BR>16. True Love Waits (I Might Be Wrong)<br />In my case, The Bends and OK Computer dominate my favorites, and such are the tastes of this fan. Those are the two albums that led me to set Radiohead up on a pedestal shared only with Pink Floyd in my musical interests. They are the first two albums I bought, and they are still the freshest on my ears. Hail to the Thief has a couple tracks I really love, the paranoid rocker \\"2+2=5,\\" and the highly unique \\"There There,\\" which builds into something one-of-a-kind by the end. Many of the rest I find pleasant and original, such as \\"Where I End and You Begin,\\" \\"Sail to the Moon,\\" \\"A Wolf at the Door,\\" among others. In fact, most of the album seems very unique among my collection, for better or worse. <br />As a whole, even after many listens, it has yet to captivate me in the style of The Bends or OK Computer. Those two albums, to me, compare with Pink Floyd's Dark Side, Meddle, and WYWH. This album I consider more of a \\"Division Bell\\" (forgive me here if you're not a PF fan) -- very different, somewhat melancholic, highly original, sometimes in a bad way and sometimes in a fantastic way. Ultimately it is one that I find a couple gems on and some solid tracks, but otherwise I'm somewhat mixed and all the fans have a hard time agreeing with themselves about exactly how to rank this album. My guess is that if you have a high appreciation of Radiohead, you will probably find a handful of tracks on this one that you'll love, and you'll probably be ambivalent to the rest. Or there is a chance you could love the whole album, or that you'll get little out of it. No guarantees here.<br />As a final note, I would like to comment on \\"originality\\": A lot of people say they are so glad Radiohead isn't \\"redoing\\" The Bends. I'm not sure if that's fair to a highly unique album like The Bends. I think that if you listen through Led Zeppelin I, II, III, and IV, you will find that the songs are quite varied, but they do have something of a \\"signature feel\\" that makes these albums more self-consistent than Radiohead's have been. I certainly would not mind seeing that kind of consistency from Radiohead and don't think it would hurt their creative legacy. Not to say I want them to sound like Led Zeppelin, but if I were producing their albums, I would rather see more of their mid-90's style, altered in gradations (not in whole) from album to album, highly *interspersed with* the kind of \\"out there\\" electronic work they do today. I'd rather they would go back to being a rock band with an experimental side, rather than an experimental band with a rock side. But ultimately that is the prerogative of the artists, so it does little good for me to make such a wish.
B00005A46T|1.0|this cd is a compilation of everything that is wrong with heavy metal today.  it is a gimick that these nine entertainers hide behind.  nu-metal \\"artists\\" like manson, staind, disturbed and korn do not know how to play there instruments so they hide behind personas which they create to reel nieve people into.  if you like speed metal DO NOT BUY this album. they do not solo, shred, nor do they have any good riffs and forget about complex time changes.  ask slipknot about time changes and they will probably say: what's that?  want good, intense, skull pummeling metal? Yes? try (old)sepultura, slayer, death, (old) metallica, exodus, megadeth, motorhead, venom, ozzy ozbourne (w/ randy rhodes), black sabbath,iron maiden. there are other great metal bands as well out there but that's all i know for know, i am always looking for more.  so, DON'T buy this album.  these guys are laughing their way to the bank.  they could care less about their angst ridden teenage fans.  the bands i mentioned know how to play their instruments and do not have hideous live shows with a circus going on in the back.  they just play music.  what a concept!  oh, and one more thing slipknot is just as bad as backstreet boys, n'sync, otown, etc..because they have been created by a bunch of boardroom ceo's just like all the others.  slipknot is really nine businessmen looking to make a quick buck.<BR>without working too hard of course!
0425098478|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. It was really inspiring. The way the book is written is excellent. It was like reading a thriller, hard to put down and there was anticipation what would happen next. At the same time very important and practical ideas were presented on how to get the most done from your team with a touch of human element.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This is easily one of the worst films of 2003.  The script is ludicrous and repulsive.  There are plot holes the size of Texas in this thing.  Aside from Colin Farrel, the cast proves itself to be very untalented.  (Although Jennifer Garner is nice to look at.)  The action sequences are tolerable, but the climactic fight between Daredevil and The Kingpin was a very big disappointment.
B000069AUI|5.0|The first song I heard from this album was In My Place.  After hearing this breathtaking song, I was compelled to buy the album.  For the past year, Coldplay has been all I have listened to.  As many times as I have heard their powerful riffs, moving bass lines, and masterful melodies, I am still asking for more!  The album begins with 'Politik' which begins the CD with a bang and propells you on a journey to the end of the album.  Every song on this album is unique in its own way.  People who can't appreciate or even perceive the differences in their songs lack the musical ear to understand them.<BR>  <BR>    I have played this album for all my friends and have literaly been a flashing billboard for Coldplay.  Most reactions are unsure at first but then they find a part in a song they like and they become hooked.<br />    The whole sound of Coldplay can be summarized as &quot;Amazing&quot;.  They remind me that 'Yeah, life can be a horrible experience but LET'S LIVE ON!&quot;
B000068TPN|5.0|This film has to be by far the greatest war story I have ever come across so far.  It not only shows that war is pure Hell but it is also the first Vietnam film ever made that shows the true honor and patriotism that our soldiers fought with.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" also gives to the veterans who fought in Vietnam the honor and recognition they should have received all along.  <br />To any veterans who read this review I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for the sacrifices you have made for our country.  You did nothing to deserve the contempt and hate you recieved from the people of this country and you risked your lives anyway.  I hold each of you in the highest respect for standing your ground and fighting for our freedom and the rights we enjoy today.  And thank you to the makers of this film for giving us the opportunity to finally see the true nature of the American soldier.
6305897786|5.0|The Ninth Gate is a great film and one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films. Twenty years from now people will give this film the respect it deserves and hail it to be the great film that it is. <br />Fist of all The Ninth Gate is not an action film. It's a slow-paced psychological thriller very similar in tone and style to Polanski's earlier films Chinatown and Frantic. Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both give great performances. Darius Khondji's photography is amazing and it has an even more amazing score by Kilar. The majority of the film was shot on location and is like a guided tour through Europe.<br />Ignore the negative reviews and comments from people who've been brainwashed and blinded by the current Hollywood fast-food style of film making with the intention of only appealing to the lowest common denominator. A review doesn't make a good film better or a bad film worse. A superb film. Rating 10 out of 10.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Anyone who saw and loved the movie Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of the Black Pearl should purchase this album. It is fantastic and it makes you feel as if you're in the movie. The best songs are easily Number's 1, 14 and 15. The first song &quot;Fog Bound&quot; has this music in the beginning that seems like an Irish beat. In 14 you can just see Jack reclaiming the Black Pearl and in 15 it speaks for itself, Will is truly a pirate. If you haven't seen the movie go see it, and if you haven't puchased the soundtrack buy it, it wil be totally worth it!!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Great Cd. One of my favorite bands of all time. There music is superb. The lyrics are some of the greatest I have ever heard. <br />Some of my Favorite Tracks are &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Warning sign&quot;. If you are a fan of U2 or Radiohead, you will enjoy &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;.
B00006AW2S|4.0|The Stones' 1965 blast of &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; sounds excellent in its 2002 remastered form.  The opener &quot;Have Mercy&quot; has a bit of a thin sound, but the boys do bounce through it in homage to Otis Redding.  Marvin Gaye's &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; is a blend of soul &amp; swagger with Jagger's drawl giving it urban sass.  &quot;The Last Time&quot; is a classic Stones track, &quot;I told you once &amp; I told you twice, but you never listen to my advice.&quot;  I've been listening to Doyle Bramhall's &quot;Fitchburg Street&quot; this summer with his tribute to Otis Reddings' &quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot; which made me jump for this reissue to listen to Jagger's romantic swagger on the slow soul burner.  The Sam Cooke tribute &quot;Good Times&quot; is one of his best melodies.  I love the live version of &quot;I'm All Right.&quot;  Of course, &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Play With Fire&quot; are two of the strongest Stones' gems.  This classic set is well worth the digital attention and sounds fresh 38 years later!  Enjoy!
B000099T2L|4.0|This talented young lady is singing for those going through or have gone through lust and love - she sings beautifully on each and every track, even seduces the ear of her listeners with songs like \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Be With You\\".  The only song I'm not too fond of is \\"Signs\\" because it throws the album off.  <BR>My favorites -<BR>\\"Baby Boy\\" because I am a huge fan of Sean Paul and I think together they did a good job. The beat is really something you can dance to.<BR>\\"Be With You\\" - this song can be dedicated to a lover, not necessarily in a romantic way...<BR>\\"Dangerously In Love\\" - I don't think I can ever get sick of this song, it's beautiful and I believe she really sings this one from her heart.
B00005TT77|4.0|The &quot;I Am Sam&quot; soundtrack shows just how amazing the Beatles' songs were.  The fact that so many of their songs are well-known tracks that were not even their singles is testimony to their unparalleled success.  While nothing matches the arrangement and performance of the original band, cover versions highlight different aspects of the music and draw it to our heart.<br />While not uniformly even in accomplishment, there are some very bright spots on this set.  My favorite is Stereophonics' version of the lesser known &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot;  Their harmony and aching vocals polish this tune to show it off brightly.  Rufus Wainwright's aunt Sloan Wainwright recorded &quot;Across the Universe&quot; on her 1998 CD &quot;From Where You Are&quot;; and Rufus' &quot;Poses&quot; CD showed Beatlesque flares in arrangement which makes his recording of Universe a natural.  When he sings, &quot;Nothing's going to change my world,&quot; it aches with a longing that it be so.  My other favorite is the Wallflowers perky version of &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; which has Jakob Dylan's resonant vocals slashed with spurts of electric guitar.  Other tracks are also excellent such as Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn's pairing on &quot;Two of Us,&quot; Sarah McLachlan's faithful rendition of &quot;Blackbird,&quot; Eddie Vedder's moaning &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,&quot; Ben Harper's dreamy &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and Paul Westerberg's &quot;Nowhere Man.&quot;  &quot;I Am Sam&quot; succeeds as an excellent disc with inspired performances of songs by the 20th century's most important rock band.  Enjoy!
B000001EYW|5.0|IT'S A GREAT CD I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE CLOSER &amp; CLOSE BUT THE OTHER SONGS WERE GREAT BARRY ROBIN MAURICE DID A WONDERFUL JOB ON IT!<br />IN MY OPINION ITS BETTER THEN SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING!<br />FROM A BIG BEE GEES FAN KIRSTEN
B00008G9JN|5.0|Although English progressive rock was always more at home in country meadows and village lawns than the â~big bad cityâ, Jethro Tull is about as Ye Olde Worlde as you can get. And nowhere else is this fondness green and pleasant lands stated more eloquentl y and passionately than on Songs from the Wood. This 1977 release is a veritable celebration â\\" a manifesto, even - of country life past and present (but mainly past). And judging from this magnificent set of songs, delivered with a feisty spirit and reassuring musical dexterity, it doesnât seem like a bad place to be. One look at the lyrics should be enough to banish any misgivings about quality and depth. All the songs are good, but I would specially recommend the title track, Hunting Girl, Velvet Green and Ring Out, Solstice Bells for a trial listen (Iâve always thought they sound a bit like early Kansas). Ian Anderson â\\" who is the creative force, vocalist and flautist behind Jethro Tull, â\\" is a bit of a genius when it comes to depicting scenarios of ru stic folklore. For novices, Jethro Tull was a major player on the British 70s rock scene alongside Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis. They were also one of the first bands in the world to broadcast gigs live via satellite. Songs From The Wood is, I think, their best album by a long chalk. A progressive folk rock masterpiece. Also check out Minstrel in the Gallery (1974) but approach the overrated Aqualung (1971) with caution.}
B000089RVX|5.0|I completely loved this album. It left me speechless. I knew as soon as I heard &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; in Daredevil that this was a band worth listening to. It breaks off from music we normally hear which is really bland and really gives you a slap in the face kind of saying &quot;Yes real bands are still out there&quot;. These songs I've had stuck in my head ever since I heard them.<BR>&quot;Going Under&quot;- excellent song. one i can definatly relate to. piano mixed with guitar and amy's haunting voice prove to be a great opening song<BR>&quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;- this song, though a little over played, is still a great song. it talks of being numb for your life and suddenly trying to break out of that state. excellent song<BR>&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;- i can relate to this one as well because i know people that amy is describing in the song. this one is one of my favorites.<BR>&quot;My Immortal&quot;- this by far is one of the best songs on the album, at least in my opinion. piano with amy's voice hold just the right pitch for all the emotion in the song. you can just hear the tear drop in her voice.<BR>&quot;Haunted&quot;- excellent harmonies all done by the same woman. that is really an accomplishment. blaring guitar and dark melodies make this song truely worthy of it's title.<BR>&quot;Tourniqit&quot;- this one is truely my favorite on the album. i love to hear song like this because they are so rare in music today. it can be interperated in so many different ways but i love it for it's emotional quality.<BR>&quot;Imaginary&quot;- i love how they did the transition into this song, flawless. once again you feel what she's talking about and feeling what she's singing.<BR>&quot;Taking Over Me&quot;- i've related to this song so much because it happened to me not to long ago. it describes my feelings and what i went through. love this song.<BR>&quot;Hello&quot;- a lot of people say this song is weird or odd but i love thissong because of it. like tourniqit you don't get these type of songs often and when you do get them they aren't any good. this song continues to haunt me.<BR>&quot;My Last Breath&quot;- a lot of people say this one is kind of the one that flls up some space but i completely disagree. this one is another one of my favorites. i can relate to this one too because i felt like that so many times before and i love the harmonies and melodies.<BR>&quot;Whisper&quot;- people say the ending to this one is odd. but once again i disagree. i liked the good use of the choir throughout the whole song and was a great ending to the album.
B000002H2H|5.0|8 songs, 4 metal gods, raged guitars and full-on drums!!  Friends, welcome to PLANET METALLICA - OLD SCHOOL STYLE!!<br />I used to listen to this album back in the second grade, right before my step-dad hauled me off to school!  The songs really prepared me for another day of learnin' 'n' fightin'!!!!  I loved pickin' on the WIMPS at recess!!  Anyway, the last song on this CD is the best:  It's long, strong, and totally da' bomb!!  Check it out sometime.  These guys were big before the Hooters franchise started or the internet.  Therefore, the results are famous!!!!<br />HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!

0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut's magnum opus. At his best his strange worlds contains deeply humanistic themes and even at his worst Vonnegut is a very readable writer weaving higher themes in a deceptively simplistic style.<br />Written as a reflection of the horror he witnessed while a POW during the bombing of Dresden, Vonnegut viewed this novel as a cathardic artistic release. Like most of his novels on the surface it seems a cartoonlike simplistic story. And as with most of his books beneath this exterior lay common Vonnegut themes. It's only at the end when we realize how the main character's experience at Dresden is the cause of his \\"alien visitations\\".<br />Vonnegut's message is clear, at least for Billy: One person is pwerless to change things in this world and the best one can dois to focus on the good things. It's a deeply pessemistic view, adn Vonnegut has always acknowledged this viewpoint. But read on another level it's about the effect of war on the human psyche. One either faces its stupidity, acknowledges the pain and sufering or one becomes life Billy and finds other means to cope.<br />Slaughterhouse Five is a great read and I highly recommend it.

B00005JLXE|3.0|I have a good friend who has been addicted to comic book heroes since childhood, and as he has matured into becoming a superb radical painter, he has been inspired by them to create his own pantheon of superheroes on canvas, with one loosely based on me, called the Rhino. So of course I had to go see this latest dramatization of one of the Marvel Comics stable of sixties and seventies action heroes, an essential part of that latest twist on the genre, with complex anti-heroes replete with a variety of twisted and tormented pasts, each trying to resolve their inner demons even as they wage a war for truth, justice, and the American way. Well, sort of.<br />The new Daredevil movie remains true to the original comic book concept, but whoever decided on the cast of this project must have being `doing lunch' out in La Jolla that afternoon that they discussed character requirements. Instead, it appears as though someone did a hasty demographic scan of the potential audience for the project and then decided to cram as much eye candy onto the screen as possible by way of the leading roles. Ben Affleck could have phoned in his role, so underplaying it that we're left wondering if perhaps he doesn't suffer from aphasia as well as loss of eyesight here. He looks and acts the part, but seems to be walking through the paces without much enthusiasm of conviction. Ben, phone home! Jennifer Garner, in her first movie since stirring in the runaway TV series, \\"Alias\\", fills the screen with charisma and sex appeal, but lacks the believable love connection to th Daredevil's alter ego to convince us she digs the guy. And Colin Farrell is so badly over the top as Bullseye that we wonder if he doesn't need a quiet vacation somewhere.<br />Yet with all this said, this is a well-executed action movie, with some terrific and sometimes quite ingenious sequences and knockout fight scenes. The special effects are also well done indeed, and what can only be called the choreography of all this spectacular violence so well punctuates the other scenes, providing such an exciting and eventful rhythm to it that we often forget just how marginal the actors are in executing their roles. Almost...yet the movie works well enough and the actors are now becoming enough of a box office draw that we can expect a sequel or two to pop out of the woodwork in the next movie season or so. This is a good movie, but one that missed an opportunity to be much better had they given Ben Affleck some No-Doze and encouraged Farrell and Garner to restrain themselves a bit. Oh, well, maybe next time.

B000055WIQ|5.0|Being that the editted version found a way into my permanent memory, I found those eleven minutes of editted scenes plus some subliminal scenes as well.  Nothing else is really different.  The Exorcist remains as one of the most scariest movies of all times.
B00005JM09|4.0|Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here.  Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected.  So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.<br />Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding.  And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference.<br />The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor.  Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it?<br />AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze.  Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!ut an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor.  Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it? <br />AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I was never the biggest radiohead fan on the block, but I own a few albums.  I wasn't going to purchase Hail to the Thief, but a friend insisted that I would love it, and after two listens, I was hooked.  the vocals are haunting and powerful, and the music is driven and charging, yet delicate.  If you've ever liked a radiohead song, and give this album a chance, you will love it.
B00008LDPU|2.0|I just watched the animatrix last night with my little sister. I'm a total Matrix fan, but these anime cartoons were deeply unsettling. The final flight of the Osiris was tragic, but helpful for understanding Reloaded. The second renisance parts 1 and 2, were by far the most useful for understanding The Matrix trilogy, and the most unsettling. Program was weird in a non-scary way. Kid's story was a little strange, but not scary or dumb. World record was BORING maybye I didn't understand it, but all it was slo-mo and useless (to my point of view) information. Matrixified was unsettling and a snore to watch. Beyond was cool. It wasn't scary, but it was a little strange. About halfway through the anime cartoons, my dad came in and watched a little of them. He said they were boring... I would just like to remind you that no-one under 15, easily scared, easily bored, or was uninterested in The Matrix should watch these anime cartoons.
B00004T9UF|5.0|White.Eminems gift and curse. It's his gift because he got a lot more attention and record sales from it. However, it's his curse because it took him a while to be taken seriously, people march against him, while they don't march against NWA. And of course, people whine that he's only successful cos he's white. I bought this cd because it's good, quality rap. I also buy good rap like Biggie smalls, snoop dogg, Tupac and dr dre, and eminem compares favorably to them (he's probably a little better than snoop). I'll go through the tracks 1 by 1.<BR>1.PSA- Funnier than the last one.<BR>2.Kill you- Catchy beat, but not eminem's best.<BR>3.Stan- Eminem's best. We've all heard it.<BR>4.Paul- Pointless and boring.<BR>5.Who knew- pretty good song about the parents who say eminem corrupts there children.<BR>6.Steve Berman- Pretty funny. You can hear snippets of it on the way i am video.<BR>7.Way I am- Great angry song, eminem practically spits the words at you.<BR>8.Real slim shady- Poppy, i used to like it when i was younger.<BR>9.Remember Me?- RBX sounds like he was raised by hillbillies, sticky fingaz needs to be locked in a rubber room, but Em's ok. Overall not that good.<BR>10.I'm Back- One of my favorites on the cd. He's back!<BR>11.Marshall Mathers- A very good song, shows em's lyrical ability.<BR>12.Ken Kaniff- Do not listen to.<BR>13.Drug Ballad- Pretty good song about drugs.<BR>14.Amityville- Rock track where the last verse is the only good one.<BR>15.B**** please 2- I like this lite song.<BR>16.Kim- not for the kiddies, but still good.<BR>17.Under the influence- Best song d 12 will ever do.<BR>18.Criminal- Great ending.
B00005JKPF|4.0|First off: if you haven't seen Bryan Singer's original \\"X-Men,\\" you will not be able to follow most of this sequel.  And that's about the only down side.  In every respect \\"X2\\" is a worthy successor to Singer's 1999 outing --it builds on character development, tugs some original loose plot threads along, and even manages to introduce a wealth of new characters without being overwhelming.<br />\\"X2\\" further tackles the theme of the first movie: the growing rift between homo sapiens and the emerging mutants.  Where the first \\"X-Men\\" mainly dealt in the fairly straightforward arena of \\"good mutants vs. bad mutants,\\" this sequel introduces the world of \\"normal\\" people into the mix and raises the stakes.  In response to growing public hysteria, the power structures in Washington are moving forward with the Mutant Registration Act --which can be seen as a not-so-transparent reference to some post-9/11 calls for mandatory registration of all Arabs and Muslims.  Most mutants are for the most part laying low, but a few among their number are moved to take bolder steps --most spectacularly illustrated by the film's opening sequence where Kurt Wagner \\"Nightcrawler,\\" played with great sympathy by Alan Cumming) teleports around the Oval Office in an attempt to assassinate the American President.<br />All of the focus characters from the original X-Men are back, to include Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Cyclops (James Mardsen), Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and of course the fan favorite Logan (\\"Wolverine\\"), played to razor-clawed perfection by Hugh Jackman.  Logan's story picks up from where he left off at the conclusion of the first film --trying to get a handle on his origins.  A visit to an abandoned research facility in northern Ontario has turned up nothing, but the questions linger.  Shawn Ashmore reprises his brief cameo from the first film as Bobby Drake (\\"Iceman\\"), considerably expanding the role as he and Rogue attempt to come to grips with their deepening relationship.  Aaron Stanford also expands his original walk-on role as \\"Pyro,\\" although it is clear from the outset that his belief system will find a different lightning rod than that of Xavier.  There are momentary walk-ons by many other characters who will be instantly familiar to longtime fans of Stan Lee's comic book --among them Colossus, Kitty Pryde, Banshee (cover your ears), and even a brief appearance by Dr. Hank McCoy (\\"Beast\\").  Sharp-eyed viewers will also catch fleeting references to Pietro Maximoff \\"Quicksilver\\") and Remy LeBeau (\\"Gambit\\").  For a change, there is no token cameo by Marvel Comics godfather Stan Lee (as was the case in the first \\"X-Men,\\" \\"Spider-Man,\\" \\"Daredevil,\\" and \\"The Hulk.\\")<br />The mutant villains Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) are back in all their glory, chewing up the scenery with obvious relish --cracking wise at their own expense even as they scheme to rid the world of what they see as a homo sapien pestilence.  Lady Deathstryke features prominently, but in a role somewhat different from her comic book counterpart --here she is assistant to General William Stryker (Brian Cox), the real villian of the piece.  Stryker represents all that is racist and judgemental about homo sapiens, willing to sacrifice even his own son (\\"Mastermind?\\") if it means coming up with a definitive solution to the \\"mutant problem.\\"  Such is the intensity of Cox's performance that there is even time for the audience to develop a momentary sense of sympathy for the character.  A measure of Stryker's ruthlessness emerges when he discovers the psychological \\"lever\\" that will force Xavier to agree to his demands.  The overall tone of \\"X2\\" is darker than the original, also more violent --whereas there were only 2 deaths in the first film (one of them offscreen), this film's body count goes into double digits.<br />With all these players, one would think that the storyline might suffer --generally the rule about superhero movies has been: the fewer the costumed characters cluttering up the storyline, the more solid the story (with the most superior examples of course being Richard Donner's \\"Superman,\\" Tim Burton's first \\"Batman,\\" and Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\").  To some extent this is the case with \\"X2;\\" the characters of Cyclops and Storm, for example, don't appear to have much to do except occasionally display their respective powers (this sparseness would appear to be the main reason why Halle Berry did not agree to sign for any subsequent \\"X\\" movies).  However in most cases the characters positively shine: Hugh Jackman's Logan takes center stage in almost every scene he is in, whether he is gruesomely dispatching ninja-clad Federal agents (well, they DIDN'T have warrants, after all) or agonizing over his unrequited love for Jean Grey.  Bobby Drake's failure to reconcile with his own family is played out with tragic brilliance, and even Kurt's admiration for Mystique is highlighted (in the comic book, she will eventually be revealed as his mother).  Janssen's Jean Grey languishes through most of the action but then suddenly develops in a surprising and pivotal way towards the end.  The infamous X-Jet gets in plenty of screen time as well, though there is no mention of the mansion's famed Danger Room.<br />It is obvious Singer made this film to keep the fans happy, and this seems to have worked: I've yet to find a negative review of \\"X2\\" in the comic fan circles.  Less devoted viewers may have difficulty keeping track of all the superheroes and supervillians, particularly if they are going into this film without the benefit of having seen the original.  Of course the effects are brilliant --the Cerebro sequences are dazzling, Pyro's battle with the Boston P.D. is truly frightening, and there is an edge-of-your-seat fighter plane chase.  With all these elements in place, \\"X2\\" ends up a darned wonderful piece of filmmaking.  It may never earn any awards of significance, but every individual who contributed to this picture should take extreme pride in having done so.y the rule about superhero movies has been: the fewer the costumed characters cluttering up the storyline, the more solid the story (with the most superior examples of course being Richard Donner's \\"Superman,\\" Tim Burton's first \\"Batman,\\" and Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\").

B00006SFBD|5.0|I saw this CD and Damnation at Sam Goody and was thinking about what to get and I ended up getting Damnation instead, only to be disapointed. I hadn't expected the music to be so tuned down but none the less, it was good. I decided to go get this one, hoping it wasn't the same. This album turned out to be incredibly awesome!! This has to be one of the best i've heard, along with My Arms Your Hearse. It has a little bit of something for everybody. My dad hates the singing in my prefered style of music so when he heard the clean vocals on track 3 he was in awe and listened to the song once or twice. I would have to say that this is one of the best albums I am in possession of and you should definatly buy it!!
B000002TQV|5.0|even if you aren't a fan of Radiohead at all.  This is one of the most perfectly concieved guitar rock albums... period.  This was my first album from Radiohead, and I loved it from the first day I heard it.  The combination of electric and acoustic guitars, and Thom's highly emotional (sometims angsty, sometimes soothing) vocals really set this album apart from everything else at the time.  It has been a very fun ride growing with Radiohead since this album.  I never knew what to expect, yet somehow I always knew it would be profound.  This is the place to start for anyone new to this brilliant band.  Is it my favorite album of theirs? NO... but I don't know how much I would care for their later works had I never heard this.  Grow with Radiohead, and be rewarded like few bands are capable of doing.
B000000WHH|5.0|I had heard &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; various times on the radio growing up, and didn't think much of it.  Also, Boy George's androgynous image led me to dismiss him for the longest time.  Then I heard &quot;Time: Clock of the Heart&quot; on the radio, and was stunned when I found out that it was Culture Club.  At once I rushed out and got this record.  And I was not disappointed.  For all his eccentricities, Boy George can sing his heart out!  His soulful and versatile delivery remind you of Smokey Robinson.

B000084T18|5.0|THIS CD HAS A PERFECT MIX OF GREAT LYRICS AND GREAT BEATS. DRE AND HIS AMAZING BEATS, ALONG WITH FIFTY'S LYRICS. AND ADD SOME EMINEM LYRICS TO IT AND YOU GOT GOLD. I CANT BELEIVE PEOPLE ARE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO SAY THIS ALBUM IS WEAK. HELLO ALL YOU HATERS THERE IS A REASON IT HAS GONE DOUBLE PLATINUM. BY FAR BEST CD OUT THERE. AND TRY TO GET SOME OF HIS UNDERGROUND REMIXES AND OLDER STUFF. FIFTY IS OFF THE HOOK.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree never stay in the same place too long.  Their earlier works are very reminiscent of Pink Floyd's pschedelic world.  The music was intoxicating, relaxing, and perplexing, and I loved every second of it.  Now, with more recent releases, Porcupine Tree has been taking a more rock oriented aproach with mixed results... until this.  This album has everything. It has intricate instrumentals, rhythm changes, hard guitar meat, acoustic passages and still remains to be experimental and psychedelic.  Wilson's vocals have always been fantastic, but here they are showcased better than ever on this album.  Most of this album (though not all) has a dark tone, which I think suits them perfectly.  \\"Strip the Soul\\" is the perfect example. It is very dark and metallic sounding, yet very easy to listen to.  Give these guys a chance... and see them live whenever the opportunity arrises, because they really kick their playing up a notch on stage.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I first got into Nickelback at the release of How You Remind Me which instantly became one of my top songs. I didn't actually buy Silver Side Up until June of this year. That's a decision I regret. I should have bought this album when it first came out because it's fantastic. When I first heard Nickelback doing How You Remind Me I thought it might have been Staind, which is not a difficult mistake to make. However, listening to this album, Nickelback is a very unique album with not only a unique sound but unique lyrics that not only please the ears but satisfy the libido. Well, maybe not the libido bit, but it is awesome.<br />Never Again - A look at domestic violence. One of the faster songs on the album and very good. I'm giving this a 4/5 because I do not like the singing throughout the whole song, only part of it.<br />How You Remind Me - The first single from the album and the song that made me want to buy this album. It's catchy and radio-ready, and its  difficult not to love this song about decaying relationships. I give this a 5/5. It is one of my favorite tracks on the album.<br />Woke Up This Morning - Another song about decaying relationships and probably my least favorite track. The opening is probably the most disappointing part and the bridges lose the rock feel to them. The chorus is the saving grace of this track, which jumps right back into the feel of How You Remind Me. A pity the whole track isn't like that. I give this a 3/5.<br />Too Bad - A catchy radio-ready song that will be stuck in your head long after hearing it. You might have heard this one on the radio. I did before getting this album but I never knew that it was a Nickelback song, I just knew that I loved it. This is a 5/5 and is one of the top songs on the album.<br />Just For - Probably the most disturbing song on the album, the lyrics blend well with the guitar playing and once again Chad Kroeger impresses me with his range. This song gets a 4.5/5 and would probably get a 5 if it weren't so disturbing.<br />Hollywood - Great song even though the lyrics are probably the least original on the album. Not to say that they were copied its just that Nickelback isn't the first group to sing about Hollywood. The guitar playing is the best thing about this track and even though I love it, it still is one of my least favorite songs. I give this a 3.5/5, it gets in just ahead of Woke Up This Morning because this singing is great.<br />Look What Your Money Bought - A very nice song, the guitar playing is great and you have to love Chad's voice. The lyrics are interesting but nothing that will get stuck in your head like Hangnail or How You Remind Me. This gets a 4.5/5, mainly because it just sounds so damn good, lyrics aside.<br />Where Do I Hide - One of the best songs on the album. Great guitar, excellent lyrics, nice singing. An easy 5/5.<br />Hangnail - My favorite track on the album. Fantastic singing, catchy lyrics and a chorus you wont be able to forget. Chad was in the 'zone' when he did this one, thats for sure. As far as I'm concerned this track should get a 10/5, but thats not really fair.. so it gets a 5/5. This is a fantastic song.<br />Good Times Gone - Another great song. It's the best song on the album for clearly hearing Chad's voice. It's got a country feel to it, but despite that, I still enjoy the song to no end. This song wont blow you away with yelling or loud guitar playing, its just a relaxed and remorseful look back in the past. A 4.5/5. Loses that .5 because of the countryish feel.<br />Overall this album is a 44/50 which is something like a 4.5. I give this album a 4 based on length however, which comes in around fourty minutes. Fortunately that fourty minutes is filled to the brim with excellent music and this album is definitely worth you're money.
B00005U1YO|5.0|The Chemical Brothers are famous everywhere for one thing. Beats. Big beats. All three of their albums, especially 'Exit Planet Dust' and 'Dig your Own Hole,' are big beat psychedelic romps through the greatest side that clubs can offer. 'Come With Us' is a bit more parapatetic in nature. The first three tracks; &quot;Come With Us,&quot; &quot;It Began in Afrika,&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; are traditional style Brothers' tracks with swooping atmospherics, huge bass output, and hard driving beats. After that, comes &quot;Star Guitar.&quot; This track combines a kind of poppy feel with the awe-inspiring genius of the Chemicals' musicianship. It is followed by &quot;Hoops&quot; and &quot;My Elastic Eye.&quot; These two tracks have distinct elements of traditional Chemical wizardry but with a much more stately and intellectual melodicism. (Is that even a word?) &quot;The Test&quot; is a standout track with vocals by Richard Ashcroft. Truly a fantastic track and it closes a fantastic and interesting album.
B000059XUT|5.0|Love this movie! It's cute and funny! Not only are the computer animated graphics brilliant, the story is creatively plotted out. <br />It's a warmhearted story about a boy named Andy whose favorite toy, Woody, feels suddenly left out when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, \\"replaces\\" him. The relationship between Woody and Buzz goes from jealousy and hate, but once they're put in a situation where they are left to fend for themselves in order to survive, all that changes into learning how to accept each other for their differences and becoming friends. It definitely contains valuable lessons for children young and old, and maybe children will learn how to treat their toys better. In addition, I love a movie that can convey every emotion, from happy to sad to happy again... And \\"Toy Story\\" is it! I love this movie! And I'm sure that even if you're not into watching children movies or cartoons, you'll still enjoy what \\"Toy Story\\" has to offer. And if you enjoy \\"Toy Story\\", you'll also fall in love with \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", another Pixar creation. But be sure to check out \\"Toy Story\\" first!
B00000JZC4|2.0|Evidently this band has been around for a while but the first I'd ever heard of them was with the single &quot;Take A Picture&quot; so I figured I would give this album a try.  While the tracks may be good (I don't mean to bash the band) they are much heavier than what I was expecting or than I like.  I thought a few songs on the album were all right (in addition to &quot;Take A Picture&quot;) like &quot;Miss Blue&quot; and &quot;The Best Things&quot;.  Since I haven't heard other albums by this band I can't make a comparison but if you're looking to buy this album based on the single itself I'd suggest not getting this album.<br />PS - The album should be stickered too for profanity.
B00005JKDR|5.0|this is truely a fine show ever made. my son's frined Peter love<BR>it so much that we all together watched the show for 59 times!!!!<br />the next good one is the Shrek which i'll give it also a 5 stars.<br />amazing job done.
B00006M183|4.0|After Binaural I was sure that Pearl Jam was still around to please the long time and die hard fans.  Riot Act has changed my mind.  As I listen to this album I found enough that sounded fresh and new to keep my attention and get me to listen to it mroe than once or twice.  This album sounds like it should keep the die hards and longtimers happy as well as picking up quite a few new fans.  In my opinion this is what Pearl Jam was needing.
0441172717|5.0|One of the most intricate and challenging books of my experience. I can read it again 30 years later and see meanings and references that I never saw before. A book that can be read at many levels.<br />This is the story of the far, far future. It is a universe where man has conquered space and colonised an Empire of many worlds. Yet, it is an Empire ruled in the ancient corrupt pattern- brutality, greed, fear, and Byzantine game playing. An Emperor rules, playing great family against great family. Secret societies play their own intricate games in the shadows. It is all the more terrifying because men have long since rid themselves of thinking machines (the Butlerian Jihad) and instead unlocked human mental potential to become far more than mere machines could ever be. Yet these gifts are still used in a vast dark, medieval web. Inspite of the intrigues, the wars, the assassinations, it is a narrow and stagnant society.<br />Enter Paul Atreides, scion of House Atreides. We see Paul grow from boy, to man, to more than man. In Paul we see the result of ninety generations of selective breeding to produce the ultimate in human development- the Kwisatz Haderach, a being capable of stepping outside of space-time itself to see all aspects of past and future in the eternal NOW. Yet Paul has not awakened to his potential. It takes his being plunged into the heart of the hell-planet Dune to awaken him. Here among the wild and honorable Fremen of the planet-wide desert he is tranformed into the warrior prophet long awaited- Muad'Dib. Even the Emperor and his elite killers learn to tremble in fear, for the prophet has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him. It is time for cleansing Jihad to wash over the stars themselves....
B000002HRE|4.0|On the companion album to Load, Metallica stretches further out into what can only be described as &quot;biker rock territory.&quot; This album has more agression than its bluesier counterpart and is definitely a better representation of the band. &quot;Fuel&quot; is super charged boogie and &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; sounds like muscled up Sabbath. &quot;Don't go lookin' for snakes, you might find them,&quot; James Hetfield warns on the swaggering &quot;Slither.&quot; Hetfield's vocals are improved, as are Kirk Hammett's bluesy fills. There are a million cool riffs on this album. I just wonder why they remade &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; into a flaccid country tune &quot;Unforgiven 2.&quot; Oh well.
B00005JLTN|5.0|i admit it's nothing compared to the original but it still is allot of fun special effects filled action. it is a great movie but it's not as good as the first.
B00005JM09|4.0|This movie is awesome! I love it! Personally, I didn't really care that James Cameron didn't do the directing, Mostow had done a great job making an action movie that's raging fast, action-packed, and even humorous. To me, this is the best action movie I've ever watched in, say, the last 3 years.<br />The cast are great, too. Kristanna Loken's T-X is the most destructive babe I've ever seen in a movie. Oh sure, she only had maybe 5 or 6 lines, but hey, what did you expect from a terminator? Cute sales robot girl she ain't.<br />What I love most about this movie is that it didn't fall into the tried (but still true, apparently) \\"The Matrix syndrome\\". If you loved and expect to see kung-fu fighting coreography, ludicrously impossible aerobatics, and slow-motion spinning camera \\"Matrix-style\\", you won't find any here. You'd be much better off watching Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle than this movie. The action is straightforward and swift, and it's non-stop.<br />Schwarzenegger's T-101 and Loken's T-X duke it out at each other in a fashion robots would: their movements were robotic, crude, raw, but lethal. Seeing T-101 smashed T-X's head through a wall, then seeing HER slammed T-101 through the wall is a joy to behold. They fought exactly like my childhood fantasy: ruining everything when they clashed. Let's just say that everytime these two met, they left a trail of wanton destruction behind them.<br />The only thing that prevented me from giving another star to this movie is that, it felt too short. Then again, maybe it was because of the feast of endless rampage and destruction I was served throughout this movie.
B00000K19E|5.0|i loved this movie. it has done so much for movies these days. it was awesome and so was the dvd.
0486211045|5.0|I have nearly ten anatomy books and this is the one I grab for most when I need to solve an anatomy problem while drawing or sketching.  <br />For the most part, Bridgman first simplifies complex anatomy problems into simple structures before exploring the muscle patterns into more complex detail. This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible. <br />For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.<br />I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well.

B00005JKN9|4.0|From the previews this movie seemed like an all out adventure and action movie, sort of \\"Braveheart\\" on the new frontier.  From that viewpoint, perhaps it was a bit of a disappointment, however all in all it is a good film.  Not to say there isn't action, but it is a long movie and in places it sort of dragged.  Some of the performances were good, as you've no doubt heard and it did present a lot of American history, hopefully that history was basically true, it's so hard to tell sometimes with stuff that comes out of Hollywood.<br />As to recommending this film, I do, however I'd venture to say that it is one to rent when you have a big block of quiet time to sit still and watch.  Unless you're a die hard fan, it'd be hard to recommend buying this film, as I can't imagine watching it again for many years, being that it is long and lacks the type of suspenseful action and excitement (Braveheart) or the incredibly thoughtful type of plot (Forrest Gump) that made these other two \\"historical\\" type movies such a pleasure to watch again and again.<br />In any case, I am not at all giving this movie a bad review, merely stating my recommendation to rent instead of buying, at least at first, just to be sure.

B000060K4O|4.0|The film \\"Ghostbusters\\" is a supernatural comedy directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and released by Columbia Pictures.  Reitman is the producer of \\"Animal House\\" and the director of \\"Stripes\\".  The film is a 1984 release and aprroximately 1 hour and 40 minutes long.<BR> \\"Ghostbusters\\" made $23 million in the opening weekend which was a studio record at that time.  The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for \\"Best Visual Effects\\" and \\"Best Song\\" in 1984.<BR> The movie is about three doctors named, Venkman (Bill Murray), Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Spengler (Harold Ramis), who lose their job at the University because some people did not like their studies on paranormal creatures.  They start their own business and become the Ghostbusters.  While working, they meet Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver) who sees strange things in her refrigerator.  The Ghostbusters come to the rescue and stop the end of the world.<BR> I would recommend this film to anyone who likes unbelievable, silly comedies.  Bill Murray is exceptionally silly because of the jokes he tells throughout the movie.  I also like the theme song because it adds to the comedy of the film.  I would give this film 4 stars.
B00003CX8I|5.0|This movie has almost got it all,from action to comedy.It's got great music too!You won't regret seeing this movie.This about the not-so distant future in which there are mutants.These are people with special abilities.<BR>                      In this,the villian is magneto,who has the power of moving and bending metal and this is a big problem for wolverine.He is another mutant that has the power of healing and his bones are made of a hard metal.Actually,this metal did not form his bones from the start but an experiment created it.<BR>                                    Logan(wolverine)soon meets the leader of a team of mutants who wants to help him.His name is Charles Xavier and he is a very strong telepath.The other mutants are Cyclops,Jean,Storm and Rogue.The partners of Magneto are Toad Sabertooth and Mystique.<BR>             This is a great cartoon-into-movie process.Only it has some less characters like shadowcat,Gambit and jubilee.The action in the climax of this movie is great.You'll love it

B00006RU5B|4.0|This is a good cd, i enjoyed it. But Tom Morello's little sound effect solos on every song just got on my nerves. Chris Cornell is my favorite singer of all time, so thats why i gave this cd 4 stars. Where was the high-pitched scream that Chris used to do? Well..he is getting older. But all in all a good cd. I recommend Soundgarden to you (in my opinion the best band ever).
0385504209|3.0|This book is certainly filled with all the twists and turns, plots and subplots, and strange alliances which make it a page-turning best-seller.  The murder of a museum curator occurs in the Louvre during the first chapter.  As the man is dying, he leaves a series of convoluted clues which his granddaughter Sophie and an historical symbologist named Robert Landgon, spend the rest of the book trying to follow.  What is their objective?  The Holy Grail, which is given a different spin in this book.  While there are historical rumors about the nature of the Grail, not as the chalice used by Christ at the Last Supper but as something quite different, this book's fictional plot is based on shaky conjecture.  It is well-written and the plots weaves deliciously around so that yesterday's allies are today's enemies.  Despite its strengths, this book is on shaky ground and it was hard for me, as a Christian, to accept the basic premise.

B000096IB6|4.0|Matt Murdock lost his sight to a chemical accident as a child. But the chemicals that blinded him also heightened his other senses, especially his hearing, which became so acute that he could distinguish objects by the sound that bounces off of them. After his father was  murdered by local gangsters, Matt vowed to use his preternatural senses in the cause of justice. He grew up to become a lawyer who refuses to defend any guilty person. But by night, Matt (Ben Affleck) watches -or listens- over his neighborhood as Daredevil, clad in a red devilish suit, ready to intervene should any citizen be victimized and to meet out justice when the court system fails. One day, when he tries to talk to a pretty woman on the street, Matt meets his match. She is Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a prominent and very wealthy man, and nearly a match for Matt's fighting skills. Matt is taken with her at once. But the man behind all of the city's crime and corruption, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), has targeted Elektra's family. And he has called upon an assassin named Bullseye (Colin Farrell), to do the job. Matt is determined that Daredevil will protect his new love, but things don't go entirely as planned.<br /><br />\\"Daredevil\\", the movie, is based upon Marvel's \\"Daredevil\\" comic book series. I am not familiar with the comic books, so I came to this movie without any preconceived image of the characters in my mind. I can't comment on how faithful it is to the original, but the movie definitely won me over. \\"Daredevil\\" is somewhat reminiscent of Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" movies in its dark themes and visuals that harken to comic book roots. James Tocci's art direction and Ericson Core's cinematography are fantastic and quite beautiful. They establish the film's mood, place, and suck the viewer in in the film's first couple of minutes. The fight sequences are surprisingly original considering the abundance  of recent martial arts action movies. Daredevil is the most convincingly human superhero that I've ever seen. He's scarred and in pain and pops painkillers like tic-tacs to get through the day so that he can exact more \\"justice\\". He is also morally ambiguous. Daredevil is a vigilante who presumes to know who deserves to be punished and how. The irony of killing and wreaking havoc in the pursuit of justice is not lost on him, and Ben Affleck does a really good job of communicating Matt Murdock's pain and moral turmoil. The cast is terrific all around. Michael Clarke Duncan is a pleasure to watch as the very large and violent, but somehow almost jovial, villain Kingpin. Colin Farrell is wonderfully entertaining as the colorful and gleeful killer Bullseye. \\"Daredevil\\" is one of the best \\"comic book\\" movies I have seen. Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is to be commended for his ability to extract the essential elements from the comic books and pack them into a 1 hour and 45 minute movie. Please note that this movie contains graphic violence which may disturb more sensitive members of the audience.evil is the most convincingly human superhero that I've ever seen.

B00005AREQ|5.0|When I was a kid in the late 60's, I couldn't get enough of Eric Clapton and Alvin Lee. I had heard \\"Truth,\\" and I was familiar with the Yardbirds, but never really paid attention.Then, in college, knocking around with all the other guys who played guitar, a friend of mine said one day that he thought the only guitarist in the world who was as good as Jimi Hendrix was Jeff Beck. He put \\"Rough and Ready\\" on the turntable, we lit up, and I was smitten for life. I can't begin to describe what it is that Jeff Beck does with a guitar that makes every synapse in my body spark. By the standards of some younger players, he lacks polish. He almost doesn't have a style, and yet I can identify him within seconds of hearing a song. Thank God he's still alive. Nobody evokes sound out of an electric guitar the way he does. And \\"Blow by Blow\\" is still a defining moment in not just sonic wizardry, but artistry.  If you've never listened to Jeff Beck, but think you like great guitar, buy this album. Like the best of Hendrix, Clapton and the Stones, it is timeless. \\"Because We've Ended As Lovers,\\" Diamond Dust,\\" and \\"Freeway Jam\\" are immortal, and will leave you speechless with their beauty and power.
B00009RGBS|5.0|The combination of sexy women with a crazy plot make this broadway musical a very entertaining movie. It takes place in a jail for women. The main characters , renee zellweger and catherine zeta jones, are two women competing for a lawyer, richard gere, who happens to be the only one who can get them out. Yes, it is a sort of dreary setting and the people aren't always happy but what can u expect since it set in a jailhouse? I love the music to the movie and had to go out and get the cd as well. If you like jazz with a little kick then you'll love this movie and soundtrack as well.
B00009ATIX|5.0|it all begins with sounds out of sequence, a voice over...it's this theme of the senses that attracted me to this film. visually, i was satiated the rendering of solaris was an optical feast painted in silent blurs that echoed this theme of geometry, systems, order...the architecture/industrial design demonstrated a realistic modernism, as if this could all be happening in today's tomorrow...the soundtrack, at times it seemed familiar, others forced, but mostly like hearing something from the inside out, womblike i suppose. touch, well it's only the sense of the sense via visual/audio textures, we'll have to wait for huxley's &quot;feelies&quot; to consummate all 5 senses... rain, lots of rain, but it didn't feel wet or like drowning (as i'd thought it would make me feel.) quite american in its length, i found myself wanting more of tarkovsky's patience, his willingness to linger, indulge, and meander.<br />george clooney does 'stretch himself' however, there are those moments where you can almost hear soderbergh's direction: george, pause, bend, slowly turn, and stare off w/that deer-in-the-headlights look.<br />i still am standing firm that it fulfilled something for my ears, eyes, mind. were there to be 10 directors who'd attempt a remake of  this idea/concept, none would be replicas of one another. having seen the original tarkovsky vision/version, you'll be a little more tuned into the tone of the idea, and your eyes  &amp; mind trained to see w/a certain perspective, i just wish hollywood would let up on the disney-fication of happily ever afters, allow us a little bit of reality, a little bit of the deeper unknown.
B00000JLWW|1.0|What S**T! Do yourself a favour and buy its breathtaking sequel... &quot;THE Priest They Called Him The Life And Legacy Of Jack Dolson&quot;... a masterpiece! This film is not only a book but a film! This film was made to be seen on Cable... God knows why? Watch out for its faboulus twist at the end! Anyway the orignal... &quot;Titanic&quot; is slow from the second it starts, gets better during the nudity scene but slows down all the way through. But when the Aliens arrive on the ship and the man gets explodes is the sadest piece of the film!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I find this album to be a heck of a lot of fun. The first several times I listened to it was totally hooked. Now that I've listened to it A LOT there are a few songs that get on my nerves, but overall this is a super-fun CD. The best songs, in my opinion, are Seven Nation Army, Black Math, Ball &amp; Biscuit, The Hardest Button to Button, The Air Near My Fingers, Hypnotize, Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine, and Well It's True That We Love One Another. Those are the most fun songs I've heard in a long time. The rest of the album is pretty good, but doesn't quite match up to those tracks I mentioned. But hey! For a recording that was completed in only 2 weeks, it's a damn fine piece of music!

B00009ATIX|2.0|SOLARIS is yet another in the series of Seventies-style movies by director Steven Soderbergh. I'm a big fan of his other films, so despite the negative reviews, I approached SOLARIS with positive expectations and an open mind.<br />This is a re-make of a 1979  art house cult film by legendary Russian director Andrei Tarkowsky. Both the original and the new version of SOLARIS are also an homage to Stanley Kubrick's &quot;2001: An Odyssey In Space&quot;.<br />There are obvious similarities between 2001 and SOLARIS. The way the films are shot, the set designs, and the pulsating sense of mystery that runs, like an endless undercurrent, below the weird head trips of the plot. <br />But there is an important difference between the two films. Kubrick's 2001 had sense enough to keep the audience highly entertained with classic sci fi elements: stunning visuals and a thrilling man-vs-computer struggle. <br />Solaris, instead, never rises above the level of a boring, introspective hall of mirrors. The impressive acting job by George Clooney is not enough to rescue this movie. It's no surprise that it flopped at the box office. Like some of the latest sci fi attempts by  Steven Spielberg (A.I., Minority Report), this film is simply gloomy, depressing, cold, lifeless -- and too impressed with its own weirdness.

B00005JMGL|5.0|Obviously I can't write a proper review on this, due to having not seen it yet. However, I believe I can confirm some points. This movie is a stand-alone effort. It is not intended to be a prequel to the excellent Robin Williams movie, Hook. It is, I believe, the first ever live action cinematic version of the proper story of Peter Pan ever to be released. That fact alone should make this movie worth seeing.<br />Secondly, it will feature the wonderful Jason Isaacs, who is superb at playing 'the bad guy' (as any who have seen The Patriot, or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would know). Apparently he also features as Mr Darling, Wendy, John and Michael's father. However, it will be the character of Captain Hook that I will be eagerly awaiting seeing him as.<br />I recently saw a story on this movie on In Entertainment, and it looks as though we are going to be treated to a true version of Peter Pan, with all its glorious dark undertones. Anyone who has read the J M Barrie tale will know full well that Peter Pan was definitely not light and fluffy, as in the animated Disney version. Isaacs looks glorious as a very menacing Hook, and the young lad they have chosen to play the boy who never grows up (Jeremy Supmter, I believe his name is) definitely looks the part.<br />The scenery looked magnificent, from the famous island to the infamous pirate ship. This movie is definitely going to be something to look forward to.<br /><br />I plan on taking my nephews to see it, but should they decide they don't want to go, I'll happily see it on my own. I've awarded five stars because we have to give some sort of star rating in order to write one of these things, but the five stars is because of the anticipation of a classic story told properly in all its glory for the first time.<br />I expect this film to be outstanding, if only because of the presence of Jason Isaacs. Maybe I'm getting way ahead of myself here, but we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
B000002H5I|5.0|I cannot put this album in higher regard. This is one of the greatest records of all time. Chapman enters issues such as Racial Tension, Poverty, Domestic Violence, Love with such beauty. This is emotive music, Beautiful acoustic guitaring combined with a real 80's style faint drumming in usually the chorus. <br />This album is worth the money it sets you back.  They don't make them like this anymore. No matter how many times those Boyzone f**kwits remake &quot;baby can i hold you&quot;, they will always slaughter it. Tracey you are a genius.
B00005JMCR|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Pie series, even though I didn't find them ungodly funny, I've always found them to be funny enough for multiple viewings, if I were to review the previous 2 I'd give them at best 4 stars.  American Wedding by far exceeds the previous 2, which is very odd in a trilogy.  One of the things that makes it far superior is that it's even more vulgar and more unafraid to cross the line a few miles, which it does over and over again, and the great thing about it is it works very well.  However, the best thing about Pie 3 is one of the funniest characters created Steve Stiffer takes the movie over and steals the show, every other character in the film is shadowed over the laughs Stiffer brings cause he doesn't have to do much to get a laugh out of me.  I'll just leave it at that, if you love Stiffler this movie is for you.  I'll leave plot points out so not to spoil the comedy.
0451169514|5.0|First of all, let me start out by contradicting the negative reviews...in my opinion, this is one of King's best, if not his absolute best novel.  <BR>The problem is, some people just don't understand it...<BR>IT is about childhood...but not simply childhood. It is about the amazing capacity for belief that the child's mind posesses.  It is about that world a child lives in where the magical co-exists with the tangible, and the transition from that world to the adult world.  It is about imagination and the raw power it has.  <BR>The children in IT would have been IT's prey had they not come together through fate or the design of a higher power...the characters are all gifted with fertile imaginations.  They are the 'losers'...and those of us who were 'losers' as children know that when you are ostracized, you survive because you posess the ability to go into another world in your mind...fantasy saved all of us 'nerds' out there.  <BR>The mind of a child and its ability to believe in something contradictory to what adults would call reality gives the monster in IT it's power.  It becomes your worst fear.  But the power of belief saves the children in IT...belief in monsters also conveys the power to believe in a method of destroying monsters...like garlic is said to stop a vampire in its tracks...what would happen if the victim didn't believe in the garlic?<BR>King presents the character's childhoods in a very real manner. We feel, smell and hear everything his characters do...and its obvious to me that King remembers his own childhood...a time often relegated to the dusty corners in the backs of our minds...a time when there were monsters in the cellar, creeping out of the dank shaddows to catch our throats from behind with their sinewy fingers.  <BR>But lets not forget the other facet of IT.  The town of Derry, Maine is IT, as much as the monster itself. This book is about the insular evil of small town America.  People turn the other cheek, walk away from the badthings...and allow them to happen...Ostracism is rampant in a small town, as is the blind-eyed attitude of its inhabitants....and that can be just as frightening as any monster. <BR>Adults are too banal to believe in monsters. They have lost the ability to tap into the great well of imagination.  They are rarely IT's victims...they are IT's vectors...<BR>Fans of Stephen King's other books will pick up on a few subtle tie-ins in this book (particularly the Dark Tower series, and even a tie-in to the Shining, another of King's best books).<BR>If you were a 'loser' who ran from bullies, if you can remember your childhood and the raw power and fear that your imagination wraped around your preceptions of the world...if you grew up in a small town with small streets and small minds...And most of all, if you still BELIEVE, read this book.

0060392886|4.0|The Dirt is every bit to literature what a Motley Crue concert is to music: an ugly four-headed monster that sticks out like a sore, infected thumb.  It sure was a blast to read, though, and was surprisingly well written, too.  This work clearly was a long time in the making, had the full participation and endorsement of the band members and anyone within a mile radius, and was intended to be head and shoulders above the tossed-together [stuff] that serves as usual rock (auto)biographical fare.  The research shows, from interviews with people from the band's deep past, to pictures documenting its 20 year ride, to use of old magazine articles and programs.  The use of visuals is never overwhelming, nor does it eclipse the journal-style script.  It's like a sly read through your older brother's diary or scrapbook, if your older brother were a hell of a lot cooler.<br />Neil Strauss clearly earned his keep polishing the raw material of the Crue interviews into the grammatically correct, coherent, and never misspelled text.  He kept a tight leash on the stories, which are remarkably consistent even when told by multiple sources.  Let's face it- as anyone who is familiar with this band (even by watching Behind the Music) can attest, with the exception of Nikki Sixx, followed maybe by Vince in a distant second, this is not an articulate group of guys one guitar-lick away from Mensa membership.  Tommy Lee comes off like a burnt out frat guy, Mick spits off non-sequiturs and pap about extraterrestrial life as if he's just trying to lose the audience, Vince is self-indulgent, and Nikki plays the role of drug and family dysfunction victim with vision.<br />Their story is fascinating, from the seedy beginning living in absolute squalor on Sunset Strip, to Tommy's jail time.  There is death, drugs, and sex, all described in excess that would make you question the story's credibility more, if you could only snap out of your reverie.  The Dirt is a wild throwback to the metal bands of the 80s, and names like Ratt and Hanoi Rocks surface to remind you how old you've gotten.  Enjoy the ride: this truly is a story of how life in a band is supposed be about going to hell and back, not winning American Idol or serving as a dancing puppet for a rich Svengali.bands of the 80s, and names like Ratt and Hanoi Rocks surface to remind you how old you've gotten.

0385495323|5.0|I read this book two or so years back ago. Recently I had a chance to delve back into some chapters and decided to write down some notes. Back then the book made me feel as if I was watching a television documentary -- I was particularly reminded of the \\"Triumph of the Nerds\\" series produced by Robert Cringely during the mid 1990s. A second reading of the public key cryptography related chapters confirmed this impression. Why so? The rhythm of the sequences. Picture the following sequence of events. A narration consisting of a brief introduction to a central figure is given, followed by an interview with that figure. The interview captures some emotion re. the critical time of \\"discovery,\\" and invites some questions re. the nature of the problem the figure faced. The narrator steps in again and explains what the problem means and implicates. A momentary lapse at the apex of achievement. Enter the party that builds upon the results of the initial figure, another interview with that party, and so on.<br />I enjoyed the Triumph of the Nerds very much and also this book. Just as Cringely had, the author possesses a fine pedagogic instinct for technical matters, and definitely understands how to \\"herd\\" the crowd. He has made interesting a topic that may have been too technical for lay readers. I was so enthralled by this book at my time of reading that upon finishing it I immediately went out to purchase his other book, \\"Fermat's Last Theorem\\" (Singh's formula didn't quite work there, perhaps because there weren't enough contemporary parties to throw interviews at -- thus losing the dynamism present in this book -- but that's a different story).<br />This much said, a word of caution. This is after all a pop science book, light reading. It is difficult to imagine how a chapter about public key cryptography can be written without mentioning certificate authorities or hashing, but here is one.<br />Sit back, relax, and enjoy. This may very well be the pop science book of the decade.he decade.

B00005JLWN|1.0|I have a fairly high tolerance for heavy handed philosophizing in sci-fi, but the plot of this movie is not only incredibly pretentious, dumb, sophomiric, but also just offensive with its not so subtle attacks (the big evil in this movie is the drug 'Prozium') on anti-depressant medications.  If that wasn't bad enough, Bale can't act and the gun scenes are truly absurd.  I don't know how people could have found the action scenes impressive--blips of gunfire around a completely black scene (you see, close study of geometry tells the protagonist how to shoot people in the dark!?!) <br />Perhaps teen boys might like it--it has some positive reviews here, but honestly I found it the dumbest movie I've seen since I rented Battlefield Earth.  I felt embarrassed for Emily Watson.
B000005IRG|5.0|In 1977, the central theme of punk was occasionally calculated swagger and an air of rebelliousness, of which Strokes-esque bands of today reek to high heavens.  To me, Television played a role within that mid-to-late seventies punk scene much like the role the Meat Puppets played in the hardcore underground of the mid-80s...they payed tribute to music itself, rather than accepting one rigidly defined form of it which dictated that one wear those black combat boots, oversized clothespins, spiked hair, etc.  Television incorporated punk somewhat more liberally than they incorporated other, more free-form musical concepts, yes, but they were able to bite the bullet and sacrifice many of the oft-absurd (though, at this point, nascent) punk ideals in the name of an accomplished sound.
0679731725|4.0|This is an extremely well-written, well-thought-out, well-timed, well-planned book.  Impeccable, one might say, just like its staid and stoic hero, James Stevens.<br />This man embodies the solipsistic personae; he knows only of his personal 'dignity', how far it can stretch, and how far it has come over the years.  He claims that the night his father died is also the same night where he approached the great 'dignity' of the legendary butlers, whom he fondles in his mind very happily in a charming early part of the narrative.  This night is also the climax of days of political debate and conspiring among the world's (we assume) most important politicians and statesmen, where Stevens puts his dead father in his back pocket so he can continue serving.  While approaching this shining statue of 'dignity' he builds up and constantly calls into question, he never claims that he actually has ever touched it, or at least climbed to the top of it.  Yet it seems it his entire preoccupation.<br />Really though, it is a red herring from the true preoccupation, the old house-keeper, a self-doubting Ms. Kenton.  We might notice that Stevens is in love with Kenton (the movie certainly thinks so) but it is never established.  Rather it is left quite up in the air, much as the amount of dignity Stevens has merited in his life.  Our judgement of this level of dignity shifts constantly in the book, confusing our sense of what is important, ultimately calling into question the validity of it's narrator.<br />For example, Stevens conveniently forgets certain details, names, occurences, while recalling in florid detail the events of some 30 or 40 years ago.  He recalls, with great passion, the story of his father defending the name of his employer against three members of high society and getting away with it, an event he was not even there to personally witness!  How can we trust this man??<br />There is so much going on in this book that the 245 pages are too maddeningly short!  I demand at least 200 more!  Perhaps Ishiguro's next book can be called &quot;Leftovers of the Day&quot;?<br />Buy it, read it.  This is one of the best books to come out since it was released (1988).
B00009ATIX|5.0|I just finished watching Solaris and since I missed it in theatres I only now wish hadn't, on the big screen it would have wowed me. This is why I go to the movies, I like to leave a film still wondering about its motives and its message (I also like escapism but in moderation)  It is a very slow paced movie and also an amazingly still piece of work. The drama unfolds in bits and pieces and even in the end you are not sure what to think. Not a very big fan of Clooney. I have to admit he was amazing in this. He reminds me of a  young Cary Grant, truly his gift of acting became clear in this movie. I urge anyone interested in hard core Sci-fi or even the most amazing love story should view this film. It is intelligent and thought provoking. The kind of movie that leaves the viewer questioning faith, love, and the power of the mind. Simply Excellent.
B000069AUI|4.0|I own both Coldplay CDs and I prefer this one over Parachutes because its just simply better. I like Parachutes but I love &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. It seems to be much happier and up beat than Parachutes. Parachutes just gets a little slow and boring and sleepy. This album is great though. So many good songs. Im pretty sure the whole world is in agreement here that &quot;Clocks&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Because it is. Other great songs are &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, and &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;. This album is a must own and so is Parachutes. But if you want the better one get A Rush of Blood to the Head.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This movie didn't seem like anything special when I looked at the cover.  Half way through the movie there wasn't anything that would've distracted me.  Towards the end of the movie I was hanging on what would happen next.<br />This movie is worth the price of admission for you and a date!
B0000009OX|5.0|What can you say about a band whose average age wasn't even 19 when they recorded their classic debut release?  What can you say about a songwriter who wrote a teenage anthem when he was still a teenager?  What can you say about an album that features tracks with titles like \\"Really Really\\", \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\", and \\"Mars Bars\\"?<br />Well, not much, save giddy praise.  \\"The Undertones\\" is an all-time classic.  Every song is pop-punk bliss: simple, straight, and to the point.  Nothing even remotely resembling a pretense.  The sweetness and innocence of it all is enough to get you teary-eyed.  No other seventies punk band really had that thing going for them.  The British punks were generally jaded and the American punks were generally arty; the closest antecedents to the Undertones are the Ramones and the Buzzcocks.  But while the Ramones had a cool, subtle artiness to them, and the Buzzcocks lingered on the more jaded and adult side of adolesence (\\"Orgasm Addict\\"), the Undertones, on their first release, raise innocence to an art form.<br />The songs are not sound-a-likes, but they all feature the same classic, essential elements: purely adolescent lyrics, sometimes silly and snide (\\"Smarter Than U\\") but mostly sweet and usually about girls, Feargal Sharkey's tremolous tenor, the brotherly guitar bite of John and Damian O'Neill, the Motown-influenced bass of Mickey Bradley (the bassline from \\"Casbah Rock\\" is a dead ringer for that of \\"In the Midnight Hour\\") and the glam-influenced drums of Billy Doherty (the tom-dominated chorus of \\"Get Over You\\" is very Gary Glitter, but in a cool way).  A more subtle motif are Kinks-esque background vocals from the brothers O'Neill, which really make many songs on this record truly great.<br />\\"Teenage Kicks\\" is widely regarded as a classic.  \\"Are teenage dreams so hard to beat?\\" is probably the best opening line to a rock song ever, and to detail every subsequent brilliant aspect of the song would result in a two-volume set.  John O'Neill, the Undertones' guitarist and primary lyricist and composer, was a mere 19 when he wrote it.  And whilst the subject matter of the song has strong...er...resemblance to \\"Orgasm Addict\\", it's approached from an entirely different angle.  And it rocks really, really hard, too.  John Peel's all-time favorite for a reason.<br />But \\"Teenage Kicks\\" is not the only highlight.  This release features three other Undertones 45's: \\"Get Over You\\", \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\", and \\"Here Comes the Summer\\", all great especially the first, which for some ungodly reason didn't even crack the UK Top 50.  It also features great album tracks like \\"Family Entertainment\\", \\"Girls Don't Like It\\", and the hilarious \\"Male Model\\" (\\"When I was young I never wanted toys/Things like that were for little boys!\\"), and B-sides such as the one and only pre-Shonen Knife punk rock song about candy, \\"Mars Bars\\".<br />To be fair, it's not a \\"Singles Going Steady\\"-esque tour-de-force where every track is as brilliant as the last.  The other tracks don't match the highlights in terms of quality.  Why spring for this, then, instead of \\"The Very Best of the Undertones\\"?  Because of the sheer simple pop-punk bliss you get on every single track.  I mean, The Undertones on this record were really just trying to have as much fun as possible and make their fans smile.  When your intentions are that pure and good, your music can't be any worse.  There's not a single bad song on here, and it never gets boring.<br />This record also lays claim to a unique punk rock honor: not ONE of the songs is three minutes long, and MORE THAN HALF of the songs are under two minutes long!  No other record I know of meets that qualification, not even \\"Pink Flag\\" or \\"The Ramones\\".  This definitely contributes to the \\"breath of fresh air\\" feeling throughout.<br />My only reservation is that there is an even better CD release of \\"The Undertones\\" available from Sanctuary subsidiary Castle Records.  It has everything this Rykodisc version has,plus the absolutely essential non-LP single \\"You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It!)\\".  The track has all the ferocity of everything else on this record, but also shows a remarkable maturity.  Unfortunately that maturity would mean a noticeable loss of ferocity on their second album, \\"Hypontised\\", and a total loss of it on later releases.  The Castle version also includes the single's B-side, a cover of the Chocolate Watchband's \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\", and an alternate version of \\"True Confessions\\" (in addition to the standard version).  It might not be available on Amazon right now, but it's not all that hard to find!
B000002UAX|5.0|For many,this is not only their favorite Beatle album, but their favorite album,period.There is just such a volume of great songs on this double set,with all four band members at their best. Legendary to say the least,and a must have.
B00006G8HX|4.0|At least the freshly refitted but fictional USS Enterprise meets a noble end in combat.  In the real Navy, the mighty USS Independence, CVA-62, was recently sent to the Mothball Fleet despite its multi-million dollar Service Life Extension Project overhaul here in Philadelphia.<br />And you've got to admit, watching the Big E burn through the atmosphere is still thrilling, especially on a modern big-screen TV.
B00009L1TA|4.0|Personally, I find john travolta kind of annoying. I put off renting this one as long as possible because of that. But I started reading reviews and decided to risk the few bucks and check it out. Was I surprised! It was really good! It's a real who-done-it kind of flick. And by now you probably know that there is a surprise twist at the end. Well, actually the last 20 mintues of the movie is one giant spiral. Just when you think you have it figured out, you're wrong. And again, and again. But the turns are not so unbelievable that you're like &quot;yeah, right.&quot; They make sense. I've seen flicks with surprise twists where it appears they made the twist just to say that it had a twist, not that it served any purpose. But in this movie about deceival, the twists are just logical parts of the plot. I'm not sure what the review meant by &quot;irrelavent&quot;. I found it all relavent, and fun. It was a fun movie. It was fun hanging onto your seat just waiting to see what would happen next. Highy reccomended. Samuel Jackson, as usual, rocks!
0385504209|3.0|Other reviewers hereabouts seem to be irate about the book's \\"research\\". For me Dan Brown has taken some readings of esoteric texts, various gospels etc. and woven a reasonably fun story of conspiracy and intrigue, not far removed from, say, an \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" which, incidentally, few confused with real history. Some might take the research herein seriously and feel challenged or threatened.<br />I would like to think, though, that most would regard this as airport blockbuster, leave your brain at the door fare. Or at least that readers might make some attempt to find out more. In which case they will come across, for instance, many online articles on the Priory of Sion and learn that there is much to suggest that this was a hoax. They would find all sorts of re-interpretations of who, or what, Jesus was - including a warrior, a rehash of previous myth elements, or even some sort of metaphor for magic mushrooms (I kid you not) as well as endless speculations as to His life and times. It's an endlessly ripe field, muddied by language and history, by what is included and what is excluded, historical accuracies and inaccuracies: a field in which the whole re-interpeting of ancient texts in order to support strange ideas was gently lampooned by Umberto Eco.<br />As for plotting - yup it's a rehash of all sorts of cliches - the albino assassin, the hero and heroine on the run, the aged male academic mentor who may or may not be what he seems. But maybe that is itself a use of traditional fictional signifiers in order to build a storyline. Or maybe not. Certainly a few cliches don't bother me - if they bother you what are you picking up this sort of blockbuster book for? There's enough facts and speculation here to keep me amused and make me want to know more, it whiled away a few pleasant hours and then I moved on.
0064440346|5.0|LOVE this book. Love it. My son loves it. I love the story about Tear-Water Tea. And...the last one about the moon. Great writing. Great story telling.
B000002WU9|2.0|This album was supposedly a classic, but I found out it was overhyped, this album has the most talking I have ever heard in my life. &quot;yeah Son&quot; &quot;Word is born&quot; thats all you here on every track which becomes really annoying. I was expecting to hear nothing but Raekwon but all I got was an above average MC with an average sidekick on every track (Ghost Face) It was supposed to be Raekwon's &quot;Built for Cuban Linx&quot;, not Ghost Face Killa featuring Raekwon. On almost every track they start talking about stupid things that make no sense. This album ruins classic hits like &quot;incarcerated scarfaces&quot; and &quot;ice cream&quot; there are some nice hits but mostly everything is wack. Raekwon needs to learn from GZA on how to make a &quot;SOLO&quot; album. Not recommnded unless you like a lot of talking and ghost face killa, go ask your friend if he/she has it and burn the good songs from them, and leave this album at the store.
6304400551|4.0|One of the greatest movie songs ever. I bought this for my toddler but he's not shown any interest in it yet. I loved it when I was a kid and remember seeing it at the movie theater with my whole huge family and my mother crying at the end...I'm sure it was because she wished it was HER taking off with that umbrella!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Wow!  Its great to see a group expand music to new levels and dimensions.  I'm a prog-rock fan and I'm not familiar with early works of the group members, but this CD is fantastic.  Not easy or smooth listening be any means, but a great triumph.
B00005RRG8|5.0|This movie is hilarious, even in my mid-40's. I thought my preschooler would enjoy it, but he isn't into it just yet. Maybe he realizes its a true chick flick. I watched it and would not let him or my husband interrupt me while I was enjoying it. Yeah, there are some syrupy bits, but overall its a classic in my collection. How could anyone not LOVE Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara?? What a stunning pair they make! Heck, I'd have flown back to California for him, too!!
0810945797|4.0|This covers every aspect of The World of the Dark Crystal.<br />The beggining of the book has beautiful artwork and explains how the Crystal was broken and how the skeksis came to be. The story itself is pretty short, but the sidenotes are great.<br />The sidenotes go into detail on the timelines, the meaning of the trines, the suns, the moons, the seoeration of the skeksis, everything. It even has an additional booklet in the back that depicts the origanal story and artwork.<br />If you love the Dark Crystal, this book should be high up on your list.
B00005JM09|5.0|This movie told us the real meaning of judgement day that the other 2 movies didn't.  Judgement Day was never to be stop, it was to survive it.
B00003CXXM|1.0|This movie should've been called \\"The Boring Identity\\" because it is boring. This movie presents itself as an awesome action movie, but it is not. The action sequences are not at all spectacular, the story is so complicated and sometimes doesn't make any sense. If you want to see a movie around the same genre, go see \\"XXX\\", and wait until this movie gets on HBO. By the way, the girl is ugly. The DVD is very disappointing with a making-of that doesn't even show how they made the movie, but shows only actors talking about how great the movie and the director are. There is a alternate ending so stupid, it is gonna make you run to the store to get you cash back. This is very boring, I suggest that we prey to God so that Hollywood doesn't make a sequel.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is one of those movies that comes once in a while. Steven Spielberg proves again with this movie that he is truly the king of movie-making. Minority Report is one of Spielberg's greatest movie. He tells this story quite complex that take place in the year 2054 with great action, dialogue and storyline. Tom Cruise offers his second-best performance in career after &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. Some people have said that Minority Report is hard to understand. Of course, for someone with a I.Q. less than 90, this can be a challenge to understand this movie, but for others, you'll have one of the greatest time watching a Spielberg film. Along with &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, Spielberg makes the year 2002, a wonderful year with the release of two of his greatest work in a long time. The DVD has some cool extras with the making-of and interviews with the cast and crew. Although this movie is very different from 2001's A.I.Artificial Intelligence, it keeps that same science-fiction glow. I highly recommend Minority Report for anyone who wants to see a good movie.
6303921248|5.0|This is just about the best movie ever made! It might be a little on the long side for my boyfriend, but if you love English flicks, and Austen in particular, this is a must-see. It's nearly 5 hours in length, and yet I have watched it more than 10 times. The acting is impeccable, the script follows the book very closely, and if there are a few corny floating-head scenes, we'll forgive them for the sight of Colin Firth dripping wet!<br />Buy this movie!
B00005JKN9|3.0|I can't quite tell where this went wrong.  About 2 hours through the film, the character's relationships all change, jarringly.  While there is some warning of this, it seems like whole scenes are missing.  Then, once you're reoriented, they do it again near the end of the film, with the NY draft riots hijacking the plot out of nowhere.<br />A best guess would be that a good 30 minutes of continuity got slashed out by the studio (for running time), making the result jumpy and muddled.  If so, I'd wait for the \\"Director's Cut.\\"
B000000XB9|5.0|Anyone who likes classic rock or just plain good music must have some CCR in their collection.  I think this is one of the most underrated bands of all time.  It's nearly impossible to listen to this album and not enjoy this CD thoroughly.  Buy some CCR and you'll love it!
6302426197|5.0|Spinal Tap kicked major [tail] and its on my top 20 favorite movies of all time. Basically its about 3 members in a rock band called Spinal Tap and they make a rockumentary, or mockumentary if what call you and the person interviewing them and making it is the director himself Rob Reiner. It made me laugh all the way threw<br />best bits are The Amplifirer that goes to 11, the mini pieces of bread, stonehenge, when Harry Shearer gets stuck in the pod for that music video, getting lost trying to find the stage and a lot more others, just rent it, buy it or borrow it and just have a good time, I really recommend it alot
014028009X|5.0|What more can I say? This is the best book I have read in a long time! This was way better than any movie! I could not even compare the two! I do appologize for not having a more wordy intellingent opinion, but one such legnthy opinion is not really necessary for such an amazing book! <BR>I also enjoyed &quot;the Nanny Diaries&quot; by McLaughlin &amp; Kraus.
6303187064|5.0|How can I put it in words, this movie rocks in so many ways I can't tell you. It's got Romance, Drama, Action, the works, Alex Proyas puts you in a comic strip itself. I mean its dark and sexy and Lee and his crow, the crow that leads him kicks bum. Possible Lee's best(examples of others include the OK movie Rapid Fire and the horrible Showdown In Little Tokyo. It kinda sucked how he died and he never got to see its great success, he was shot I think with a blank in the head, and it said that digital movie magic made it so that he appeared in the rest on the movie and there's a special edition tape that has his last interview on it). It's a classic revenge keeper flick
0156027321|5.0|Most of you who are considering buying this book right now already know that _Life of Pi_ is about a boy and a bengal tiger adrift in a lifeboat.  That fabulous premise is reason enough to read it, but as you begin, you will soon realize that the novel goes much deeper.<br />Pi (short for Piscine, which means \\"swimming pool\\" in French) is introduced as a boy in India learning about the animals in his father's zoo and delving fully into three separate religions.  He already seems adrift, but the family's venture across the Pacific in order to move to Canada doesn't happen until page 90.  And yes, much of the Pondicherry Zoo accompanies them in cages, but headed to different destinations (various zoos in the United States).<br />This is definitely a review in which I don't want to say too much, but the ship does sink, and Richard Parker the tiger isn't the only animal to reach the lifeboat.  In fact, there are days of struggle before the \\"crew\\" is reduced to only two.  And I have to admit that I had cozy images of the young boy curled up with the tiger, the open ocean forcing them to hang on to each other for comfort.  But as surprising as it may seem, this is a realistic book.  Richard Parker remains exactly what he is:  a very hungry, thirsty, and sickly 450 pound carnivore.  Only by utilizing what he has learned by studying animals can Pi keep from being torn to shreds.  But as for surviving the ocean...  both Pi and Richard Parker have a lot ahead of them.<br />I was fascinated and transported by this beautiful book which is presented as a true story (part of the mystery is that I still don't know whether it is).  My favorite section has to do with a tactile discovery the two make while still on the open sea; the ending of the novel leaves the reader possibly frustrated and definitely wanting more.  However, things never stop happening as they would REALLY happen, truly amazing in a novel which on the surface seems so much like fantasy.  Read it for the plot, read it for the Martel's poetic writing style, read it to learn about animals.  But definitely read it.  You won't really understand until you do.d it for the Martel's poetic writing style, read it to learn about animals.  But definitely read it.  You won't really understand until you do.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is Tool's greatest CD (which is saying somthing). I love this CD it is the greatest modern day heavey metal CD. The jewel case is made so when you put the pictures inside under the case the pictures move. Which is a nice feature, you can even see what Arizona bay would look like. All the tracks are meaningful, like Stinkfist, and some funny, like Intermission. Aenima is amazing and I think their best song (which has some Bill Hicks references). Third Eye is a great tribute to the late Bill Hicks. To fully understand this CD you should also add Bill Hicks's CD &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;. Warning: If you chose to take my advice also be aware that you may find some of Bill Hicks's humor to be offenceve. Any way back to this CD, this is a must have for any Heavy Metal fan.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I found this movie to be quite well done, and I frankly don't see what all the whining is about from people who say that this movie is Anti-Death-Penalty. <br />I suppose by creating a movie that features a main character (David Gale) who is an activist against the death penalty it suddenly becomes a movie that is 'propaganda' against the death penalty? This is the silliest thing I've ever heard! <br />And if you watch the movie and recognize it as the work of art that it is, you would agree. When it comes down to it, I find that this movie has just as many arguments against anti-death penalty views as it does for. For instance, one of the main veins of the plot is featured in a radio broadcast with the Governer of Texas and Gale. Gale goes off on a tangent and the Governer comes right back at him with the question \\"Give me the name of one innoncent person who was killed through the death penalty\\". David has no answer...because as far as he knows there hadn't been any innoncent victims of the death penalty. <BR>   <BR>Hello, did people miss this part? I mean this is a clear  thread that supports the death penalty and it fits in to be an important part of the story. <br />Without giving away the ending to the movie, because that is one of the story's strongest features, the ending, I will say this to all of those who are so quick to have their political viewpoints 'hurt' by this film: How valid is the point which was sent through the ending? Consider who was involved. Which was more perfect, the framing of Gale...or of the system that prosecuted him? In the desperation to make a case for something, one, lost in their passion, will go to great lengths...sometimes false lengths. I feel that this is a higher point made by this movie...whether or not the director intended it.<br />So, in conclusion, I see this movie not as an anti-death penalty, nor as a pro-death penalty, but instead as an abstract depiction of the human ambition. It is a work of art...not some small minded propaganda as some are saying. If you watch this movie looking for something to whine about because the whole world doesn't believe exactly as you do, at least have the integrity to not taint the film with your poor-me's. <br />The evidence is all in the movie. It is a film that points neither left, nor right, but points all-encompassing. That is what art is, a medium which transcends the limitations of the human mind.<br />Whatever your views are, indulge with great pleasure!
B00000K0DV|4.0|As you'll read numerous times over, this is Fulci's most unpleasant , sleazy and ugly film.  I think there's two reasons for this: 1)  It's all centered in the real world as opposed to the supernatural world Fulci is known for, thus losing the fantasy element.  2) Alot of sex.  If someone's not having sex or prancing around naked, there's always some sexual undercurrent going on, making this quite sleazy.  In my opinion, the most disgusting scene being, not one of violence, but a game of \\"footsie\\" that seems to go on for ten minutes.  This part is really bizarre, surreal, and just plain yucky.  Yeah, we all know the plot:  A sadistic serial killer(is there any other kind?) slices women up into olive loaf, taunts hard boiled detective, tra-la, tra-la.  The plot's nothing new, but this is Fulci, people!  Which means you get all the trademark gore from his supernatural horrors transplanted to a slasher flick.  You also get all the bad dubbing, acting and funky tunes translated too.  Basically, if you like his other stuff, you'll like this coz it's still a gory Fulci horror flick-it's certainly not gonna appeal to anyone else!  There's a pretty crazy scene when our \\"duck\\" killer is slicing up a woman tied to a bed.  This is pretty whack!  Does Fulci shy away from the carnage and let your mind fill in the gaps?  Nosiree, Bob!  He just lets you sit back and watch the killer drag a razor blade across the poor girl's eye!  Yikes!  Sure it looks fake as hell, but it's what it represents that counts.  I'm willing to bet by the feel of this film that Fulci's girlfriend must have left him around this time or something, coz he doesn't seem to like women too much here.  This film comes across as a way of lashing out or something.  Sure it's very juvenile and Type O Negative-ish, but it does make for an entertaining movie.
0440180295|4.0|Sorry, I always have to put lame titles for my reviews. Anyways, this was my first Vonnegut book. I figured that since it's considered a classic and all, I should see what it was all about.<br />I knew it was going to be different. I knew it was going to be strange. I knew that I would enjoy the experience of reading it. But the question for each of those was \\"how much so?\\" Anyways, once I was done, I knew that I'd be reading more Vonnegut.<br />This was one of those books where you can't immediately decide if you liked it or not. I thought, \\"I THINK I like it...err...maybe?\\" One of my friends, who is also a Vonnegut fan, let me borrow Breakfast of Champions, which I had no doubts about whether I liked it or not. I definately enjoyed Breakfast of Champions better. Slaughterhouse Five is great it its own right, for sure. War + Weirdness = Fun? ::shrugs::<br />Definately check this book out if you like original stuff! Haha.
B0000024KQ|5.0|This is one of the best rap albums out of Queens, NY, and there's been a lot of great ones, since Queens seems to be home(or at least birthplace) of some of the best rappers of all time, including Nas, Kool G Rap, Cormega, Mobb Deep, etc., etc.  This is one of my favorite albums of any genre of music, and if you like grimy street beats, and crazy violent lyrics/imagery, then this album is sure to please. Even the skits on here fit right in(unlike on a lot of albums, where they sometimes seem out of place or leave you wondering what the ____ they meant by putting them in there), and I especially like &quot;maintain&quot;, but all of the tracks on this one are great, so if you're in the mood for some no nonsense violent real street raps, you can't go wrong with this one.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I hated this movie the first time I saw it.  However, I couldn't get it out of my head, and watched two years later, and got past what made me hate it.<br />I like the acting.  Schwarzenegger is perfect as a Terminator with minimal personality and lines.  He is menacing and does not justify his actions at all.  He just DOES.  Hamilton is very good in her role, and Biehn is, as always, excellent.<br />The story is original (for Hollywood).  It's also simple enough to fit in a movie.  A robot coming from the future to kill the mother of the man who successfully led the rebellion against a robot-controlled future is quite good.  It is believable (for those who can accept this type of story), and enough is left to the imagination that it isn't spoiled.  The sequels forgot this technique.<br />The special effects, of course, are generally poor.  We can tell Schwarzenegger is wearing a rubber mask when he does surgery on his face, and the robot is obviously animation.  However, watching the movie, I didn't care.  The story was good.<br />The violence is well done.  It is a very violent movie, but the violence is more imagined or suggested.  It is not shown very much.  I appreciate that very much.  The sequels glorified in blood and guts and random destruction.  This one is very focused.<br />The ending is depressing.  Although, obviously, Hamilton wins in the end and survives, the world is still facing nuclear destruction and near extermination of the human race.  That was why I hated the movie so much.  What I came to realize later is that the world is not a happy place.  We have happy moments, but what really keeps us going is knowing that no matter how dark the world is now or may become, it will get better.<br />This movie did not need a sequel, and its storyline actually outlaws sequels.  The two sequels are pale imitations.  They have far better special effects, but the stories and the action are totally unbelievable.  I never cared about anybody in the sequels andeven started cooking while I watched them (always a bad sign since I hate cooking).<br />Buy this one.  Forget anyone ever made sequels.
0066620996|5.0|This book crystalizes concepts that are key to a company's success.  A sure sign of intelligence is the degree to which someone agrees with you--Mr. Collins puts a name to concepts almost identical to concepts we have developed and put into practice since 1980.  We called ours:  Dynamic Intuition: Think People; Think Strategy and Think Virtual.  Encompassed within our three are Mr. Collins 6 core concepts.  We highly recommend Mr. Collins' book--as we have seen the concepts work in practice!
B000092ZYX|5.0|If I could shout only one thing for the rest of my life at a Radiohead concert, it would be: &quot;Your music is PERFECT!!!&quot;<br />Hail to the Thief hits the spot. It's genius. Also, the band seems to be reacqauinting itself with the earthliness of humans again, not as indignantly (but painfully) removed as on previous albums, which are also genius.  It's a real joy to observe the mobility of Radiohead -- how they feel they want to connect with humanity through the turns of each of their albums. It's what the music world needs. Thank god these guys exist
B000002MTR|4.0|It seems as if the Peppers hold back a little on this disc- it does not reach the standard set by Blood Sugar Sex Magik, or even its predecessor, Californication. Maybe this is because Dave Navarro is no John Frusciante. Either way, this album houses some real gems. \\"Deep Kick\\" is a punky biography of Anthony and Flea's early days. \\"Tearjerker\\" is one of RHCP's most poignant and heartfelt songs. \\"Aeroplane\\" is just flat out fun. Not the Chili Peppers' best effort, yet still essential.
B00006BTCA|5.0|... have I written a fan letter.  Yes, embarrassing, i know. And not since The Bends, have i been so struck by musical perfection.  The Bends knocked me flat.  Thank god for Hail to the Thief, b/c my boys were nearly usurped by Interpol. Wow, what a refreshing album.  Both nostalgic sounding as well as forward and inventive.
B000002LQR|5.0|Amazing. Not only is this the Chili Peppers' best album, it is perhaps one of the best and most influential albums of all time. There's something for everyone on here: funky rap, ballads, hard rock. Essential for any record collection, regardless of what your taste is.
B00005JLTN|2.0|Why?  Why try to improve upon perfection?  You can't.  The first Matrix had no flaws.  It didn't have a cliff hanger ending.  If a sequel never was made  every one would have been happy.  So why would the Wachouski Brothers bother making this movie.  The Matrix was a blend of suspence, action, mystery, and sci-fi.  Take that winning formula, get a trukey baster and suck out the suspence, and mystery and you have a dead action sci-fi otherwise known as Matrix Reloaded.  When i first saw it I really liked it.  A few days later I popped in my first matrix dvd and was blow away.  Don't get Matrix Reloaded.  Get The Matrix.  All the sequel is is CGI action, completely usless Dance and sex scenes, a  (looks as if it was ripped from a PS2 game) fight scene, blah blah blah blah blah, fight on the stairs, fight on the freeway, Oh i don't you to die boo hoo hoo, cliffhanger, the end.  Oh if you wait untill the credits are over there is a preveiw of the next one.  After  thirty minutes of credits comes this piece of junk teaser trailer.  Although that will propably not have anything to do with the DVD realease.  OH!  Other \\"New\\" Matrix products to stay away from:<br />The Animatrix (don't listen to what anyone says.  It's worse than the movie.)<BR>Enter the Matrix (an extra hour of footage that expandes upon two forgettable characters.)<br />In conclusion:  Did anyone besides me notice that most of the new line of Matrix shirts have Matrix one images on them?  Coincidce?  I think not.<br />Note:  I gave it a two out of five for making a horrible effort.
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah delivered again with Music Box. I was all of 6 years old when it came out, but I still remember dancing to it and whatever. Now let's take a look at the individual tracks, shall we?<br />Dreamlover (10/10)- The album's opener and Mariah's first real venture into modern hip-hop. Not at all a bad thing.<br />Hero (9/10) - This is definitely a song that can lift your spirits. I still pop it in my cd player if I'm bummed about something major.<br />Anytime You Need A Friend (10/10) - A gospel-pop ballad. Mariah excels in these. <br />Music Box (10/10) - The lyrics are so well written and ties in with the music so beautifully.<br />Now That I Know (10/10) - Hmmm...a house track. If this were released as a single, it could have possibly turned Mariah to a whole different audience and made her even more popular.<br />Never Forget You (8/10) - This song is pretty, but at the same time, it is kind of bubble-gummy.<br />Without You (10/10) - Mariah goes for the low notes in the first chorus of this one. I actually forgotten she could sing that low, and when she does, she carried a lot of power.<br />Just To Hold You Once Again (9/10) - see #6<br />I've Been Thinking About You (10/10) - Another hip-hop flavored track that is actually one of the best tracks on the album.<br />All I've Ever Wanted (10/10) - The album's closer. I like this song so much.<br />There are some things I want to say. First of all, the only song that Mariah really recycled was Fantasy (into Heartbreaker) but Emotions, Dreamlover, and Honey do not sound like each other.
B00005JLTN|5.0|the matrix reloaded is definitely the movie i have been waiting to see. i have wanted to see a true comic book/anime movie come to life ever since watching the old batman tv shows. i have always been disappointed time and time again. i was disappointed with the christopher reeves superman and (although the first two weren't bad) i was disappointed with what joel schumaker did to the batman movies as well.<BR>what i liked about the matrix reloaded is that it is just like reading a comic book or watching a cool anime. both of the wachowski brothers are fans of comics and anime and i believe what they set out to do was make a movie that was just like a comic book or an anime. they are the only ones to have ever done that (so far). the similarities between the matrix movies and anime are numerous: camera angles, the speed of the action, the pauses in the action, etc. even the storyline seems to be very influenced by alot of anime such as ghost in the machine.<BR>the martial arts in this movie are top notch. anyone who knows anything about martial arts knows that yuen wo ping is one of the finest choreographers in the business. with every passing movie i have seen of yuen wo ping, i have witnessed his martial arts choreography exponentially improve. his are among the best kung fu movies ever; fist of legend, legend of drunken master, iron monkey, crouching tiger.<BR>this movie really has it all!<BR>great yuen wo ping kung fu - check!<BR>awesome anime style - check!<BR>flying characters - check!<BR>great special effects - do i have to say anything about that?<BR>great storyline - check! (i don't care what anyone says about the storyline, i thought it was an excellent story with more plot twists than i expected) i can imagine how hard it is to come up with a story to follow the first matrix but as i was watching the movie, i didn't care one bit about the story. in fact, all i really wanted to see was action. as far as i'm concerned, they could have completely done away with any semblence of a story and just had 2 hours of action. <BR>alot of the best kung fu movies have very weak storylines. the action is what makes a good kung fu movie becouse the japanese and chinese know that action speaks volumes, a lesson most americans have yet to learn when it comes to film. i know i'm turning japanese (or at least i can admit it).
B000002BQK|5.0|By 1997 it seemed that Mariah had a formula for the material she was releasing: start the album off with an uptempo cut, throw in one or two hip-hop tracks, make the rest of the tracks ballads (including the closer), and sneak in one house track. When Butterfly was released, it didn't change that much. You still had your uptempo opener (\\"honey\\"), the hip-hop tracks (\\"Breakdown\\", \\"The Roof\\"), the house track (\\"Fly Away\\") and of course, the ballads (\\"Butterfly\\", \\"Babydoll\\", \\"My All\\", Close My Eyes\\", \\"Whenever You Call\\", \\"Fourth Of July\\", \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", and \\"Outside\\"). However, her image underwent a much-needed revamp. In Daydream, she was on the cover in a black shirt and pants, and in her \\"Fantasy\\" video, she wore jeans and a long shirt and rollerbladed. On the cover of Butterfly, she wore a gold tube top and matching skirt, and in her \\"Honey\\" video, she was in a skimpy brown bikini. I say she needed the revamp for a couple of reasons. One: the heifer was 27 years old and some of her songs, while well written, are a little too innocent for a woman who is not a virgin and was approaching 30. Two: Her popularity was starting to wane. Why? Because her material was becoming too similar in the eyes of the public (you have Mottola to thank for that) and people were getting tired of her. She needed to show that she was capable of more than the material she had been told to deliver in the past. And the butterfly emerged from her cocoon.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Well, seven years has been a too long a wait after the memorable Memorial Beach, but Minor Earth Major Sky (MEMS) has clearly lived upto the expectations and the wait. This is an awesome comeback for the sweetest band on earth. You cannot find an alternative to A-Ha, the greatest export Norwey ever did. <br />MEMS starts with the incredible tittle track which is a straight 10/10. Little black heart follows up, in classic Aha morose style. Velvet is something you could play to your girlfriend and watch her cry, its moving. Then comes the greatest song Aha ever composed, the mindblowing, incredible, haunting, SUMMER MOVED ON, featuring Oslo Philhormonic, this track will not leave you once you complete listening to it. I always wonder how lucky we are for this great comeback of Aha. Rest of the album is all good, will never let you down, Thought it was you, MAry Elen, I wont forget her, You'll never get over, all are clearly winners. These are songs that will haunt you, pain you, hurt you, but still you want to hear more and more. This is the intrinsic feature of Aha, and MEMS more than displays it. Please buy it, in case you are reading this review to make a buying judgement, what you get is more than what you pay...
0066620996|4.0|The best thing about this book is: it is so simple to read and understand, and hence easy to remember.  The concepts laid down are so simple, and yet sometimes surprising.  Mr. Collins did not complicate the findings, and use very simple terms and stories to illustrate his findings.  Since the results are driven from detail researches, it adds certain credibility to the overall framework.  Ignoring the notes of the researches, the book only has +200 pages.  This is a must read of even the most busiest executives.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It would be amazing if the released the original 3 on dvd....without any changes. I don't want guns to be flash lights, Han to shoot second, and obvious cgis that don't go with the puppets and models that make up the movie. There is nothing more distracting then a beatifuly done scene with a giant video game looking character walking through. All you atention is drawn away from the characters to look at some crazy creature that was inserted 30 years after the fact. And how about the scene where Jabba walks around Han. Possibly one of the worst additons ever. I agree it is cool to see what they added, but it is all out of place. And though it was minor, Han shooting the alien after being shot at in the bar took away from his loosome character. He is supposed to be scum, who learns to help others. <br />I would be all for dvds where you can select what version you want on the front menu. Something like \\"original verson\\" and \\"butchered version\\", but if we can't have a choice then just give us the original.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I swear Christina is, like, an angel or some junk.  She's, like, totally gifted and stuff.  When I hear the melodious tones of her heartwrenching voice, I'm swept away to a land with marshmallow clouds and chocolate rivers.  Sometimes the emotion becomes too much and I weep for all the pain in the world.  This soulful album reminds me of the plight of those who are, like, in poverty and don't have conditioner and stuff like that.  My poodle, Fragee, occasionally booty dances to this CD while I lick the bathroom floor and moan.  Oh yeah, by the way, this is just a total crock and I really hate this artist and her awful, warbling voice.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This movie was terrible.  The story was absolutely numbing.  The interviews on the second disk with the writers/creators of the comic book was much more interesting to me.  The DTS soundtrack does have some serious bass in it for you subwoofer fans out there.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is a great album! My favorite song is &quot;Echoes&quot;,but thats the only song the people really recognize on the album.&quot;One Of These Days&quot; is astonishing,&quot;Pillow Of Winds&quot; is great,&quot;Fearless&quot; is great,&quot;San Tropez&quot; and &quot;Seamus&quot; are very overlooked.I'm a country boy,so I love these songs.
B00006RIO7|5.0|For those of you who have never seen the Musical or watched the Movie, don't buy this!!! (Just yet, that is!!) First, see the movie or musical, because after that, you will be able to appreciate this Soundtrack that much more. Here's my Top Three Favorite Tracks From This Album:<BR>1.We Both Reached For The Gun- Absolutely Hilarious, and Done Very Well!<BR>2.All That Jazz- Wow, can Catherine Zeta-Jones sing! Her voice is a powerhouse in this one.<BR>3.Cell Block Tango- Amazing Vocals on this one. Each actress/singer has her own strengths on this one.<br />Overall, an amazing Soundtrack, and an amazing movie/musical!
B00005JLEU|4.0|I had no idea that I was getting a Disney production when I rented Spirited Away. But when you press Play on the DVD you don't get opening credits, but instead John Lasseter - creator of Pixar Studios - laying it on a bit thick about how fortunate you are that Disney has brought you this wonderful film. Thanks, John. Just shut up and let's get on with the show.<br />It certainly is a wonderful film. It's no surprise that the animation and storyline are fantastic - that's been well documented here. It is surprising that the rest of the experience - the voices and music - are so weak. They are too Western to fit well with the visuals, and I assume that's attributable to the Disney production team. (Another reviewer - &quot;from Seattle, WA USA&quot; - wrote more about this.) The one extra meta-feature that I watched was so self-congratulatory that I couldn't finish it. Yes, we all recognize that we owe the Disney Corporation a huge debt of gratitude for bringing us this masterpiece of animation. I'd like to get ahold of a non-Disnified version, though. Maybe I could give that one the full five star rating.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a down is by far, hands down, without a doubt the best modern rock act.  I've bought every piece of their music, including bonus, and import items.  I have varied tastes in music, but Systme is still my favorite.  This album is said to be second rate, and B tracks.  Those people are correct.  The only thing is this material is better than 95% of newer rock groups 'A' material.  Which is something to say for the quality of this CD.  I would highly recommend this disk.  My favorite songs are BOOM!, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, and NuGuns.  those are my favorites.  This is my second third favorite system cd.  My first is their self titled.  I'm just totally addicted to it.  Only cause I've listened to it the most.  System music really does grow on you over time, as you listen to it more and more.  Which I can garuntee you will listen to this and any other system album over and over again.  Buy it, and enjoy it.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This movie should be mandatory viewing for every household that celebrates any holiday.  It is the perfect example of \\"there is no such thing as the perfect holiday\\".  Every December 15th I sit down with presents to my left, wrapping paper to my right, and turn on this movie as I start wrapping presents.  When the movie is over, I re-wind and play it again - and again - and again.  I've worn out three VHS tapes, and I'm working on my old DVD version.  I plan to get this new WIDESCREEN version as soon as it hits the shelves.  It keeps the holiday season in perspective for me - that there really is no such thing as a \\"perfect\\" holiday gathering.<br />Clark W. Griswold wants one thing in life -- The Perfect Christmas.  What he gets is an hilarious mixture of uninvited relatives, feuding in-laws, cheapskate bosses, yuppie-neighbors, rampaging dogs, feisty squirrels, insensitive visitors, a dead cat, and one heck of a wild ride on a bobsled!!!<br />For anyone that has ever wanted to have a perfect holiday, you must see this movie!!!  It will keep things in perspective for you.
6305736650|4.0|The 5th best movie, next to 1st Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, 2nd G1odfather and Schindler's List! I'll give it 4.4 stars.
0790729377|5.0|For various reasons, I have never liked either the play or the film on which it is based but remain fascinated with the human experiences which Tennessee Williams examines. The character of Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) dominates the narrative but his wife Stella (Kim Hunter) really is the stronger person. Pregnant, she is visited by her sister Blanche Dubois (Vivien Leigh) who arrives with enough emotional baggage to keep a regiment of psychotherapists busy. She and Stanley have an immediate and ambivalant chemical reaction to each other. To her, he is a lower animal, unworthy of her sister; to him, she is a posturing, pretentious bitch. Under the brilliant direction of Elia Kazan, Leigh's performance suggests how fragile, vulnerable, and desperate Blanche really is. As for Stanley, to invoke a weary aphorism, what we see is what we get...except that he seems vulnerable without his wife's love and support. Both on stage and in the film, there is no doubt of the powerful sexual attraction between Stella and Stanley. Williams invests the character of Blanche with ephemeral qualities. In some respects, she is an elderly Scarlett O'Hara who reluctantly endures her sister's boorish husband because she has nowhere else to go. Her personal \\"streetcar\\" has reached the end of the line.<br />The acting is consistently outstanding. Of course, we know early on that there will be a major confrontation between Blanche and Stanley. Oscar Saul collaborated with Williams on the screenplay which carefully prepares us for it. When it finally occurs, we feel sympathy (if not pity) for Blanche and her relocation to a new home in which, perhaps, she will receive the kindness she so obviously craves. There is great emotional power in this film. Also, I think, sadness with regard to the resolution of Blanche's association with the Kowalskis. With all due respect to Leigh (who received an Academy Award for her performance, as did Hunter and Karl Malden for theirs), I would have preferred Jessica Tandy whom I was privileged to see in the Broadway production. Tandy captured -- in ways and to an extent which Leigh does not -- certain nuances of Blanche's illusions and delusions which are indelibly poignant.d Jessica Tandy whom I was privileged to see in the Broadway production.

B00005QCVY|4.0|Rated R in Finland! This is a family movie! I'll give it 4.3 stars.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I've been a Radiohead fan since I saw them on their first tour, when they opened for Belly (what ever happened to Belly?), but I'm enjoying their music less and less. I just can't get into this album at all. I've listened to the album maybe 5 times, and I wouldn't recognize one single tune if you played it for me now. They just don't stick in my head they way that songs like &quot;Karma Police&quot; and pretty much any tune from The Bends.<br />I'd say, buy the album if you're a die-hard fan. You probably already own it by now if you're a die-hard fan anyway. If you really thought OK Computer and The Bends were great, go buy the Coldplay CD instead. You'll be much happier with your purchase.
B00006G8G4|5.0|This is one of the best DVD gift sets that is on shelves today!<BR>Tobey Maguire is NOT the best actor out there, but he plays the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man better than anyone else could ever do. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are as good as they sound, if not better! The extra goodies that you get in the DVD box set is worth the extra money. <BR><BR>Overall: Buy the box set if you are a fan of Spider-Man. It is totally worth the extra money!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been a WS fan since De Stijl, and they just keep getting better and better. I love the variety of this album, from the 70's inspired, hard rockin' opening tune \\"Seven Nation Army\\" to the final track \\"It's true that we love one another\\" which reminds me of an old Loretta Lynn tune. Jack sings a couple of lovely ballads (\\"I've got you in my pocket\\" is my fave, and Meg sings a sexy, minimalist song, \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" which reminds me of \\"Fever\\", the old standard that Madonna covered a few years back. There are some bluesy numbers, like \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" and then some more rockin numbers \\"Little Acorns\\" and \\"There's no home for you here\\". Then, a McCartney-esque tune, \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself \\".<br />With all of this variety, one would think it would be a disjointed mess, and just sound like the WS are trying to not be niched, but incredibly, the songs flow together perfectly.<br />This is the best album I've heard since White Blood Cells!

FREE DIRTY!!
B00008DDSC|3.0|I have to be honest with you all. I've never engaged in deviant sexual behavior. I don't know why? But I guess maybe it's because Hollywood movies try to make that kind of lifestyle seem so silly, or maybe it's cause it hurts to have a whip to your rear, or to get spanked with an open palm. I myself do not enjoy getting spanked but maybe you do! If this is true than Secretary is the kind of movie for you!<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) plays Lee Holloway a young woman who has just left a metal institution on the eve of her sisters wedding. She was in there cause she likes to cut herself and when she gets home you understand why. Her father is a viscous drunk and her parent fight all the time. The father is also quite abusive. Poor Lee has nothing else to do but get a job. So when she finds an ad in the paper for a secretary she jumps at the chance.<br />The job is working for a lawyer named E. Edward Grey (James Spader, Stargate) an interesting cat, whom has a fiery temper and a gentle streak as well. That is until he realizes his attraction to Lee and begins to beat her. Luckily it a sexy beating and she likes it.<br />Secretary was a film I bought right up until near the end. I began to understand the plight of two people with serious problems to deal with. I think the film is sensitive to their plight. But then there is this scene late in the film where a large crowd gathers around the law firm. I couldn't understand why this scene is necessary. I had hoped it was some wild dream in Lee heads, but no.<br />That being said I believe Gyllenhaal does an adequate job with Lee. The performance runs the risk of falling into Mira Sorvino lands (a place where you make up a funny voice and that's called acting quirky (see Mighty Aphrodite)) but it doesn't. She has this sense of wonder in her voice, I loved the little scene in the bathtub where she's practicing how to answer the phone, it is just adorable.<br />Spader's character is good. It's just not drawn well enough. After the film was over I still longed to know what made him tick, I wanted to know what made him hurt, and I wanted to know what causes a successful man to want to dominate women like he did. But the film doesn't like to tell secrets.<br />There is also a subplot I felt was unnecessary. It concerned Lee and a local boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies, Spanking the Movie) and their sweet little relationship or was it? I guess it was meant to mirror her and Grey's, against her parents. But I don't think it was effective as it should have been. I would zone when Peter arrived on the scene. It's too bad cause I normally like Davies' roles.<br />Director Steven Shainberg (Hit Me) has crafted an interesting but not terribly compelling story. I can understand how the indi crowd could come to embrace it. It's full of some really original ideas. But the problem with original ideas is if you introduce a less compelling idea it usually falls flat. SECRETARY is still a good movie just not a great one.<br />I wouldn't force you to become a slave to Secretary, but you'll probably like it anyway.<br />***1/2 (out of 5)st not drawn well enough.

B000069AUI|5.0|I had not been incredibly impressed with Coldplay until purchasing this album.  The reason I did was because of the spectacularly heartfelt performance at this year's grammys.  All the songs are wonderfully written with haunting melodies.  I love every song on this CD, especially the title track and The Scientist.  It's a must-have for every music fan and I recommend it.

This CD makes you want to Grrrr making a case for little Polly Jean being a pioneer riot grrrirl rocker.  I've been listening to this of late, here ten years after it came out and I'm entranced all over again with it's fierceness, it's raw \\"take what we have on the first take\\" garage three-piece simplicity, it's dirty emotion naked and riotous.<br />PJ Harvey is a little woman with a huge fierce voice.  It sounds best here with a simple rolling punching bass line and a wailing screaming guitar.  I argue for Harvey's \\"Rid of Me,\\" being the seminal female indie rock release opening up avenues for the likes of Alanis Morissette and others of her ilk to follow.  It deserves more credit as an equal if not better piece than Liz Phair's \\"Exile in Guyville.\\"<br />If you like your music smooth, non-confrontational, and studio-polished, this one is definitely not for you.  Try PJ Harvey's \\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea,\\" instead.  But if you like the rawness of many of the garage band phenoms taking the \\"what's hot now\\" scene by storm (ala White Stripes), don't miss out on \\"Rid of Me.\\"<br />Harvey doesn't mince words when she is expressing her rage and sexuality.  She doesn't shy away from subjects.  She hits topics right on leaving the semi-puerile slightly wincing.  That's OK, though, take a walk on the wild side with a 50-foot queenie...she's real, she means it.
B000002UZ4|5.0|I 'came of age' in the 80s, and was working in London when the PSB first began releasing music. 'West End Girls' is a quintessentially London song; I immediately went out and bought their album. I've been purchasing all their albums since.<br />This collection contains the major songs (the single releases) from their first four albums, plus a few new songs. For anyone who wants to have a good collection of 80s music, this is a must for the collection. The disco is present but not banal nor overpowering; the lyrics are intelligent and neither syrupy-sung nor screamed. The videos which go along with these songs are clever and artfully done.<br />The playlist includes:<br />West End Girls -- a number one hit in America, Europe, Britain and Asia<br />Love comes quickly<br />Opportunities<br />Suburbia -- music perhaps inspired by EastEnders<br />It's a Sin -- another international no. 1 hit<br />What have I done to deserve this - a collaboration with Dusty Springfield<br />Rent<br />Always on my mind -- a remake of the classic<br />Heart<br />Domino dancing<br />Left to my own devices<br />It's alright<br />So hard<br />Being boring - name derived from Gertrude Stein<br />Where the streets have no name (can't take my eyes off of you) -- a combination of songs cleverly done<br />Jealousy<br />DJ Culture -- a new song released with the album<br />Was it worth it? -- another new song, released later<br />The PSB don't easily fit into any particular category -- while they are gay performers, they are not exclusively 'gay' performers; their music reached a wide audience and was not preachy (in fact, their song 'How Can You Expect to be Taken Seriously' consciously pokes fun at pop stars who become spokesmen and 'experts' simply for being famous in another field). Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed upon the length of CDs, this song had to be omitted from this collection (it does appear on the video compilation, however).<br />Rolling Stone recently described them as being 'the Grateful Dead of the europop scene'. This is rather close to the mark in that they have dedicated followers who devour everything they produce as well as a more general audience who like them without obsessing. There are a few US No. 1 hits on this album, as well as songs that were much bigger hits in the broader world as American trends in music (at least as driven by radio and MTV airtime) have changed while the PSB sound is very much the same.<br />And of course, the over-the-top disco version of 'Always on my Mind' makes me laugh and sing along every time I hear it. Neil Tennant has such a wonderful dead-pan delivery, and Chris Lowe's artful use of brass, string and bass together with backing beats, all from the electronic keyboard, is truly a wonder.<br />This is an essential CD to have to understand the 1980s, London in the 80s, pop culture in the 80s. Also, to just have a good time! A great discography.europop scene'.

0451191153|3.0|It would be very easy to reject this massive work as a simplistic product of yet another humanistic evangelist.  The worldview is more black and white than the Koran.  Parts of the plotline don't work.  The romantic dynamics are silly.  And there are other pretty transparent weaknesses (more below).  But the truth is that buried in almost a thousand pages, and underneath some laughably cardboard characters, there is an absorbing story here.<br />First off, not all the characters are weak.  The protagonist, an unorthodox architect, is a sensible and dedicated hero worthy of respect.  His fundamentalist dedication to Reason is strange, and in some ways robotic, but he is a likeable fellow.  Be warned: his expressions of the Reasoning Self are disturbing and sometimes criminal and they inevitably place him in conflict with society as a whole.  But not to worry, reassures the author, it's all for a good Reason.<br />Mr. Objectivist is surrounded by some pretty fascinating supporting characters as well.  The character problem becomes evident about half way through the book when we recognize that most characters are not so much persons as caracitures of a various ideological perspectives. Their interactions often become predictable and irritatingly pedantic. <br />This problem is amplified in the climax of the novel, a scene in which our rational hero is confronted in a courtroom by the legal implications of his behavior choices.  This scene degenerates into a sophomoric lecture on the moral superiority of rationalism and the human spirit.  Which isn't a spirt, it's a consciousness.  Except it's a Reasoning Consciousness.  With Purpose.  And that's what makes it Good.  You get the idea.<br />There are other baffling odddities.  The symbol of objective purity is ... architecture and building design.  Hmmm.  That's a pretty subjective starting point.<br />Still, I didn't mind the book.  It's written at a level for thinking adults, worthy of the priorities of its author.  The plot isn't predictable.  The key areas of architecture and New York elite culture are treated with humorous sophistication.  Perhaps the best thing is that the worldview is not hidden, which allows for some critical evaluation if that's your bent.  Just be warned, this isn't light reading and doesn't pretend to be.
B00005JH9W|5.0|Tod Browning, in 1932, created a film that in its time was considered so repugnant that it was quickly taken off the screen.  Great Britain banned its showing for over 30 years.  In the United States, it was not shown until it became available in the 1960's.  So why all the fuss?<br />To appreciate this film (and most films and most books too), you need to create a visual time machine and travel to the period when the film was made.  In this case, in 1932, there was no television and there was no internet.  There most certainly weren't reality shows or \\"talk shows\\" of the Jerry Springer ilk.  In short, people who went out for entertainment, went to films, circuses, fairs, athletic events, etc.  It was a time when the \\"televised news\\" came as \\"newsreels\\" shown before a feature film.  Films such as \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Dracula,\\" etc. were considered truly horrifying.  When, in 1927, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" was released in all its silent glory - at Lon Chaney's unmasking, women fainted in theaters with regularity.  The world was a simpler place.  Actual murders, mutilations, etc. weren't shown in video over the cinema screens as happened with the repugnant \\"Faces of Death\\" films.  Jeffrey Dahmers and Ted Bundys didn't get worldwide press and have every disgusting detail of their crimes published.<br />For frights people went to the horror films or they went to the circus side show.  That is when \\"Freaks\\" was made and this is the audience to whom the film was targeted.  It is with this knowledge that one must have to watch this film.<br />\\"Freaks\\" is a short film, coming in at just over an hour.  It would have been considered a \\"short\\" and shown on a double bill with another film.<br />The premise of the film is that the denizens of a circus' sideshow encounter a possible murderer in their midst and they have a suspiscion of just who it is - the non-freak Olga, the trapeze artist - who has been seducing the resident male midget (who just happens to be from quite a wealthy European family).  She wants to get his money and to do so must convince him to drop the woman who truly loves him - and marry her.<br />The plot is thin and the acting is marginal, at best.  However, what Browning was really doing was...yes, in part, exploiting the \\"freaks\\"...showcasing real circus side show freaks.  You have a man born with no legs, who walks on his hands.  A man born with no arms, legs, shoulders, or hips (who is showcased as he demonstrates how he lights his own cigarettes).  There's the bearded lady, the pin heads, the strong man, the half man-half woman (who were in reality were hermaphrodites made up in halves for the general public, but for an extra amount would show you their privates to really demonstrate their uniqueness), and the aforementioned midgets to name a few.  These people weren't actors - they were real, honest-to-God circus sideshow freaks.  Each of these \\"characters\\" is given a brief showcase for their sideshow shtick, as it is worked into the story.<br />\\"Freaks\\" brought about a complete change in circuses throughout the United States.  It became all but illegal to have freak shows as the public became repulsed by such shameful displays of unfortunate humanity.  The feeling was that these people were not \\"freaks,\\" and shouldn't be exploited.  In reality, for the most part, these freaks had long ago realized their plight and decided to make a living from their disfigurement or deformity.  Frankly, most made a darn good living from the guilt off the \\"normal\\" folks and when that livlihood was taken away from them, they became destitute (but at least the normal folks could feel good about themselves for \\"saving\\" the poor pitiable \\"freaks\\" - HA).  It was one of the first of the ill-designed movements in the \\"politically correct\\" arena.<br />However, time has a way of addressing injustices - even those well intentioned ones.  The circus \\"freaks\\" of the world spoke out and got angry with their livlihood having been taken away fromthem, without anyone asking them what they thought (When was the last time you heard of Barnum and Bailey's freak show?  There hasn't been one in over 60 years, because of all this fuss).  So, the public realized their concern was unnecessary and got off their high horse.<br />So, watch \\"Freaks\\" for what it is:  a time capsule of a film that DOES have a very horrific scene in it (imagine yourself as a child seeing this film for the first time):  the angry freaks go after the person they believe is a murderer.  This takes place in the dark, during a driving rainstorm.<br />Rent or buy this film and enjoy it without a bit of guilt!
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you like bands like Radiohead and the Flaming Lips then you will love Hail to the theif. They show it all in this album from the electric rock and roll mood of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; to the vocalist masterpeice of &quot;A wolf at the Door&quot; it really brings out the best of what radiohead has to offer. Top to bottom this is one of the more impressive albums of the year.
B0000256VK|5.0|Whether cassette, vinyl,or CD, it has been one of the constants in my collection's ever changing universe. What's really unique about this one is, whenever I put it on, I still almost get a chill at the beginning, and feel transported by the end. It's always fresh. I don't know how they did it, but they really tapped into something that, over time, has proven to be a rock in the musical landscape post 1980.
B000002V1D|4.0|Very original.  I've had this album for 10 years and I keep coming back to it, mainly for &quot;Come Undone&quot;.  But Sin of the City is pretty good too.  And you've gotta love the LL Cool J sample.
B000001DWG|4.0|I like this album, a lot, Mother Love Bone would've been huge if Andrew Wood hadn't died of a drug OD ending the band and starting Pearl Jam. I love Pearl Jam a lot, and I think they are one of the best bands today.  Kudos to Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden for being better than Nirvana!
B000024KBZ|5.0|Big Thing is one of my favorite Duran Duran albums.  The entire B side with &quot;Lake Shore Driving&quot; and the Interlude - it's 1980's syntheizer magic.  No band on earth has ever come close to this incredible sound.  Listen to it in the dark for a sensual treat.
6305546789|5.0|This movie is probably the most important film in the industry of horror type films. it started the whole mask wearing phase that we still go through today. It also started some of todays hottest carrers ok maybe not so hot but it did start them.<br />The whole thing i dont understand about the people who like this movie or who comment on it is that they always say he stalked babysitters. Michael didnt stalk babysitters he stalked his family members and killed whoever got in his way.<br />As far as the characters there are three very important roles The shape himself(best played by nick castle in H1 and Brad loree in H8) in my personal opinion, DR. Sam Loomis, ANd Lory strode. without these characters the movies are garbage as you can see through out Halloween 3. The shape is basicaly the imbodiment of evil its self michael is evil in it purest form.<br />And his character is well brought up through out the series.
B00000DQSV|5.0|If you could only have 2 obscure Duran Duran B-side albums, you should choose this one and Big Thing.  Listen to Big Thing's B side in the dark, and listen to this one in the wintertime.  &quot;Winter Marches On&quot; has incredible depth and texture.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I give 'All Eyez on Me' a 5 out of 5 for a number of reasons. 'All Eyez on Me' is one of Rap's finest CD's ever made, it sold very, very well and it is by Rap's finest rapper EVER.<br />Known to be his 2nd Deathrow record album, this was Hip-Hop's first double disc album. 2pac was raised in the hard life where nothing really worked out for him. He had no father, he moved from place to place making no childhood friends and his life was a shack. 'All Eyez on Me' pretty much sums up 2pac's life.<br />On 'All Eyez on Me', 2pac released 7 songs from this album. Disc 1 features 6 out of the 7 released songs. Disc 1 starts off with 'Ambitionz az a Ridah', talking about the fast lane. On disc 1, you'll find some of his westside rhymes like \\"All Bout U\\", \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\", \\"California Love\\" and \\"Heartz of Men\\". There are some songs that is powerful enough to make you cry like \\"Life Goes On\\" and \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\\". However 2pac does lack on one song singing about how good sex is on \\"What's Ya # Number\\". The production for both CD's is excellent and features some pretty good producers like Johnny J, Daz Dillinger and one of Rap's most important producers, Dr. Dre. \\"Only God can Judge Me\\" pretty much sums up his death and is by far the best song on CD1.<br />Disc 2 is rather different from the first disc. Some songs are heavier, mellower and angrier. \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\" explains the meaning of being a gangster whereas \\"Can't C Me\\" shows 2pac's west side once again. A very excellent track indeed. \\"Picture Me Rollin\\", 2pac's last single released, is best played in the cars rolling by, \\"Rather Be Ya N.I.G.G.A\\" is the best song on disc 2 and has a very catchy tune.<br />To sum everything up, 'All Eyez on Me' will always be one of Rap's finest CD's ever made. 2pac wasn't just a person or a rapper. He was a teacher and I thank him for every single message he passed to the world. And if you listen to trash like Ludacris or Nelly, change your taste in Rap.
B000002WYT|5.0|Let me start off by saying I have had this cd in my 250 plus collection since its arrival in stores. However I never really, and I mean really listened to it. I knew the hits, as I always adored \\"Crash Into Me\\" I just never got into it. A few years after its release I listened to it one day, and was blown away, I was musically more mature and open (hence becoming a DMB Fanatic).  This is easily one of the greatest albums ever recorded, hitting status with Led Zeppelin - Zoso IV, Metallica - Black Album, Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon, and Radiohead - OK Computer.<br />So Much To Say - (9/10) A great song, incredible energy, clever lyrics, upbeat guitar, overall is a great song.<br />Two Step - (10/10) One of the best DMB songs ever written. It'll blow you away live. I love this song, from the opening guitar riffs to the divine lyrics \\"celebrate we will, for life is short but sweet for certain.\\"<br />Crash Into Me - (10/10) A Classic! One of thier biggest hits to this date. A very melancholy song, with excellent musicainship behind it. One of my all-time favorites (even though it was a huge radio hit).<br />Too Much - (8/10) Soaring energy, a great DMB song as they all are, although I never got into this song as much as other people.<br />#41 - (10/10) Top 10 all time DMB songs ever. It might be the best song to see live, as it usually pushes the 12 minute mark, sometimes 15. Leroi is utterly dazzling on the sax, a true tune arching its back to jazz. MIND BLOWING!<br />Say Goodbye -(10/10) An incredible song, with ingenuis lyrics. Great energy. One of the best. <br />Drive In Drive Out - (8/10) Once again I never really got into this song as much others. You must remember though, I do LOVE every DMB song. This is a great song, very very powerful. <br />Let You Down - (11/10) Maybe my all-time favorite DMB song, and easily my favorite off this CD. Very soft and chilling. Incredible lyrics. A soft song, and extremly provacative. I love it, \\"I'm a puppy for your love...\\" <br />Lie In Our Graves - (10/10) Another classic. The solo in the middle where it fades in with people in the background is simply amazing. I love this song to death. One of the best DMB songs ever written.<br />Cry Freedom - (8/10) A lot of people say this is one of the better DMB songs ever, but I have to disagree. It is amazing, don't get me wrong, it just doesn't do it for me. I love it, like I love all DMB songs, just a little less than most (especially on this CD, as opposed to the live versions).<br />Tripping Billies - (10/10) An incredibly fun, uplifting song. Great lyrics, incredible energy a real fan pleaser at shows. I love it!<br />Proudest Monkey - (10/10) One of the best DMB songs ever written. A very odd song, excellent, excellent, musicainship behind the song. I could listen to this song over, and over all the time. Maybe the most under-rated DMB song of all time. <br />I just want to stress that most of these songs are DMB's best, because \\"Crash\\" is their best besides \\"Under The Table And Dreaming.\\" Please, please do yourself a favor and listen to this cd, open your eyes, your ears, your mind. Believe me, I know music, and i know you'll enjoy this CD.
0553213105|5.0|This is one of the best writing of Jane Austen's.<br />The title aptly says in a few words what the whole<br />story was about.  Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa?  It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...<br />Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelings<br />and emotions that were surprisingly accurate.<br />Everyone came out a winner in the end.  I particularly liked<br />Mr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal.  In all cases, they were both right in their own ways.  They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.<br />In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!
B000099T2L|4.0|You can always appreciate someone who can really SING these days!  Not only does she sing, but she wrote most if not all of the songs on the album.  I am more of a Kelly Rowland fan than a Beyonce fan, but I must say that the combination of her performance on Divas Live and her album has helped me to find some new respect for her.  While there are a few songs that you have to bypass because they just don't do anything lyrically (Song for Virgo &amp; Daddy), the good songs are really good.  I like the two songs with Jay-Z---Crazy in love and How you like it.  The duet with Luther is awesome.  My favorite song is #6--it takes you back to the 70's---- kind of like the new Monica song and one of the songs on Kelly Rowland's cd (which is really good).  Overall this CD is good!  Beyonce is talented!

6304698798|5.0|Let me preface my review with a story.<br /><br />I grew up in a time when westerns ruled the television airwaves of the early sixties - Bonanza, Gunsmoke, etc.<br /><br />In the mid-sixties,  I recall seeing the advertisments for a new motion picture called \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\". When I saw it, it had the same effect on me as hearing The Beatle's Sgt Pepper's album for the first time - this film was different from anything I had ever seen before. And notwithstanding my youth, I was vividly aware of having seen something so different, so revolutionary that it took me some time to get my bearings.<br /><br />And I quickly became a disciple of this amazing Italian film maker - Sergio Leone.<br /><br />And so a few years later, when The Good, The Bad and the Ugly was released, it was a foregone conclusion that I would see it. And see it. And see it over and over again. Over a three week period, I paid to see it 19 or 20 times with advances on my allowance. On the 18th or 19th time, the cashier just looked at me and said in a very monotone and deadpan voice  \\"You like this film, don't you..??\\".<br /><br />An understatement if there ever was one.<br /><br />Almost 40 years later, I still love The Good The Bad & The Ugly and with the exception of Leone's magnificent Once Upon A Time In The West, I think this is the greatest western ever made.<br /><br />The Man With No Name has defined the anti-hero perhaps better than any other character before or after him. Prior to Eastwood's character, westerners were relatively one dimensional characters identified by the color of their hat (if white it was a good guy and if black, it was a bad guy). The Man With No Name redefined all of that. In fact, the idea of the anti-hero transcended westerns and in the sixties, we were seeing them in every film genre.<br /><br />Images of the poncho clad Eastwood with the small cigar in his mouth became an iconic symbol of the 60's and contributed to the change that the 60's entailed.<br /><br />Eastwood as the enigmatic Man With No Name - Eli Wallach as the memorable Tuco in perhaps his finest role and the late, great Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes. These three men created these memorable characters that still live on so many years later.<br /><br />The Good, The Bad and the Ugly follows the trails of three very different individuals, each of whom discovers that there is $250,000 in gold buried in a soldier's coffin in a cemetary. Uneasy alliances are formed between these characters and the film builds towards a powerful climax when Leone once again stages a memorable gunfight, complete with the pocket watch music we first heard in For A Few Dollars More. The gunfight is perhaps my favorite moment of any film as Leone's close-ups of the eyes and \\"twitchy\\" hands of the three gunfighters is drawn out with Morricone's powerful soundtrack in the background.<br /><br />Ennio Morricone again created a soundtrack that is instantly recognizeable and an integral part of the film. In fact, I don't think there has ever been a musical score/composer that has contributed so much to the success of a film as has Morricone. It would be impossible to even contemplate a Leone film without Morricone's haunting, majestic scores in the background.<br /><br />I've probably seen this movie a hundred times and yet if I'm home with little to do and come across this movie on television, I wouldn't hesitate to watch this movie.<br /><br />And each time I see it, I'm transported back in time to a theater  where a cashier once remarked to a young boy 35+ years ago \\"You like this movie, don't you..?\\"<br /><br />Close - I actually love this movie..!!!orable Tuco in perhaps his finest role and the late, great Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes.

0792101448|5.0|Every once in a while you'll read a book or listen to a record or see a film that transcends superlatives.<br />Once Upon A Time In The West (OUATITW) is solidly entrenched in that very select grouping.<br />Sergio Leone's epic and sprawling tribute to the American West of the latter half of the 19th century is so magnificent that there are no words to do it justice.<br />I've always felt that this film is not only the greatest film of its genre (with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly running a close second), but it might very well be the very best film ever made of ANY genre. Period..!!<br />Sergio Leone has captured the grandeur of the American's west's landscape better than any other director before him, including the great John Ford. For anybody who has ever driven the highways of Utah or Arizona around Monument Valley, it's impossible to look at those vistas without seeing Leone's vision or hearing Ennio Morricone's indescribably beautiful and haunting soundtrack.<br />I don't think there has ever been a collaberation between a film maker and a composer that has generated the artisitc genius and magic that these two gentlemen have conjured up. Morricone's music has become an integral partner of Leone's magnificent movies - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More - that it would be impossible to separate them.<br />Leone has created a magnificent story about three men, a woman and the land.<br />Henry Fonda spent a lifetime creating memorable characters, however, his portrayal of Frank, the hired gun of a ruthless railroad baron is perhaps his most riviting role. The early scene of a father and his children being shot and killed by a group of duster-clad men is very very powerful. However, nothing prepared the viewer when the camera slowly panned around and there was Henry Fonda looking down at his next victim - a young boy - who has witnessed the massacre.<br />Charles Bronson as Harmonica is wonderful casting as well. I can't recall seeing Bronson in a performance later in his career that matched his performance.<br />And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Jason Robard's riviting performance as Cheyenne. Robards brings an incredible amount of depth to his performance of a wanted outlaw who is feared by everybody - but still recalls that his mother made a great cup of coffee - hot, strong and good..!! The scenes between Robards and Claudia Cardinale, the widow, are some of my favorites moments in the film.<br />It always struck me as ironic that it took an Italian director to creat a movie about the west that probably captured it better that any other director - before or after him.<br />I grew up watching American westerns and seeing characters that were always clean shaven, for example, with perfectly white teeth and walking around in well fitting, clean clothes and living in immaculate little homes.<br />Sergio Leone gave us a west where the men were always in need of a shave. Their clothes were tattered, at times, and didn't always fit perfectly. The buildings were ramshackle at times. And it was a violent time where life was oftentimes very cheap.<br />I've seen this movie dozens of time and it never fails to have an emotional impact on me.<br />It was this film that solidified my love of the American west and compelled me to move to the region from Toronto, Canada many years ago.<br />It was this film that enhanced my fascination and love of the  history and culture of the American west of the 19th century.<br />This is an epic motion picture by a brilliant filmaker that deserves all of the accolades it has received over the years.<br />Thanks Sergio for this gem..!!ecall seeing Bronson in a performance later in his career that matched his performance.<br />And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Jason Robard's riviting performance as Cheyenne.

And it was a violent time where life was oftentimes very cheap.<br />I've seen this movie dozens of time and it never fails to have an emotional impact on me.<br />It was this film that solidified my love of the American west and compelled me to move to the region from Toronto, Canada many years ago.<br />It was this film that enhanced my fascination and love of the  history and culture of the American west of the 19th century.<br />This is an epic motion picture by a brilliant filmaker that deserves all of the accolades it has received over the years.<br />Thanks Sergio for this gem..!!
078322804X|3.0|Yes, its great that Universal FINALLY released this movie on DVD, but they really should have included with it a copy of the originally edited film.  I love this film so much that I will have to go buy a VCR just to watch my old wore out copy of BB (my 4th copy lol) because the unedited one just screws up the whole flow and feel to the movie.  The extended scenes are interesting, but this movie is NOT the blues brothers.  My recommendation to you, if by some chance you havent seen it yet is to buy this film on VHS first, watch it, then get the DVD....
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This album was a total surprise for me ... I'd never heard Ryan Adams or Whiskeytown and bought this on a total whim one day when I had $... to spare. What a fabulous buy ... there is only one song on this entire album I don't like ... \\"Nobody Girl\\" is a bit too long and repetitive. But everything else is great, and \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\" sends chills up my spine every time I listen to it. Adams has a soul and it's a pleasure to hear it come out.
B00008WT49|2.0|I love this Norah Jones album.  The CD stereo and the SACD stereo mixes are excellent but they made a monumental error on the 5.1 mix.  They have used the LFE channel in the 5.1 mix for the bass content but it has been mixed -10dB relative to the bass in the stereo mix.  Heh guys this is an SACD, not a Dolby Digital decode where the LFE is boosted by 10dB on playback!  We use the 5.1 analogue outs from my SACD player with no decoding or modification to the audio. <br />I wrote to Blue Note but they did not reply.  Fortunately I run a separate pre-amp for my bass and I can put the +10dB back however don't buy this SACD unless you can equilize the bass back to 'normal'.<br />Just for the record, my system is calibrated.  Bass management is still a very misunderstood beast.  Hopefully Blue Note and Sony might get it right soon.
B00006RIO7|5.0|It was the songs from the movie.  They sounded good.  There were some extras also, Lil' Kim and Queen Latifah do a song together, and there is another song that was cut from the flick that is on here.  This isn't the most amazing CD ever, but, let's face it, if you liked the music to Chicago and want to listen to it, this is it.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Without a single doubt, Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is the best that the film industry has to offer on all levels.  No other film version can even come close to nipping at his heels. Unfortunately, Laurence Olivier's superb acting was heavily marred by his vicous chopping up of the play and his excessive self-indulgence. Mel Gibson was a joke; Richard Burton was good, but suffered from a bad quality production; Ethan Hawke was abominable; Campbell Scott was commendable; and Kevin Kline was both unique and refreshing.  But Branagh is by far the best.<br />The scenery, the camera work, the acting, the editing, the faithfulness to Shakespeare on all levels.  I cannot emphasize how exciting and how welcome this movie has been within the Shakespearean community.  If you feel compelled to purchased yet another version of Hamlet for your collection, the click the BUY button and vote for this rich production. My hat off to you, Mr. Branagh!
B00003CXCW|5.0|I do not plan to rehash a review of this film.  If you're reading this, you know the plot.  Needless to say, this is one of the best films ever.  It is also one of the best DVD's ever.  The transfer is flawless, the sound and images are perfect.  The extras are out of this world.  A full-feature length running commentary by an informed and interesting expert, interviews with Nancy Olson (I guess she's the only one left alive), a whole section about the original opening scene, stuff about the stars, this DVD is actually worthy of this movie.  For any fan of Sunset Boulevard, this is a must-purchase-immediately item.
B00009V7RF|1.0|What a piece of garbage. <br />Aside from being trite, overproduced, witless and boring, this has to be the most offensive release in recent history. \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is a slap in the face to anyone with a serious disability. Go ahead and make fun of people if you must, but do it to those who deserve it, not to people who can't control their condition.<br />Elsewhere on this useless piece of junk, the lyricist decries racial discrimination and asks, \\"Where is the Love\\"? Good question. I guess y'all have no \\"love\\" for people with developmental disabilities. <br />Oh, but that kind of discrimination is OK. I get it. I'll write a song called \\"Let's Dance Like a Porch Monkey\\", and we'll see how much airplay it gets.<br />Unbelievable.
0060977493|1.0|This book is terrible.  I had to read it for an Indian literature class and it really made me want to vomit.  If I had managed to vomit on a piece of paper it would have been more impressive than the writing in this novel.  For starters this book is so derivative of Rushdie's work it is amazing.  Read Midnights Children and then read this and you will see the similarities.  Note:  I am not saying that Rushdie's work is the same quality as Roy's, just that she stole alot from him. I've seen her claim to not be familiar with his work.  Come on, you're Indian writing an Indian novel and you haven't heard of one of the best modern writers of your country?  Then she throws in some unneeded sexual passages andputswordstogether because she is so artistic.  She attacks the caste system, wow really original there. []If you read any of Ms. Roy's political commentary (read: rants) you will realize[]why the Booker prize people liked her so much.  Or maybe they wanted to give the prize to an Indian author with a liberal bias, I don't know. All I know is that anyone who proclaims this book a great work of literature probably thinks Maya Angelou is a good poet too. Don't hold your breath waiting for another book to come out, she won a prize with this [] and she doesn't want to be found out for what she is.
0515123447|4.0|I read one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels quite awhile ago, and thought it might be worth checking out the others.  I've finally started to read them from the beginning, and I wonder why I waited so long.  This book is jam-packed with action from cover to cover.  Jack Reacher is the most understated Rambo-type hero you'll ever meet.  This book is not for the faint of heart.  There is a lot of very descriptive violence in here.  The grammar is not of the highest calibre, but it does not detract from the story.  And oh what a story it is!  We meet Jack Reacher - the guy with no ID and no fixed address.  As we read we find out about his background and life before he reached Margrave, Georgia.  As soon as he reaches town he gets thrown into a conspiracy huger than anything he could have imagined. and he finds that he's got to clean up a whole town which has been corrupted by a philanthropist  and his foundation - Mr. Kliner.  This is a humbdinger of a book.
B00005JM09|4.0|Though many critics have commented that this new Terminator is basically a retelling of the second film, I would like to begin by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by this third installment of this very successful franchise.  Though the film lacked the direction of James Cameron, who was largely responsible for the birth of the Terminator series, it was nonetheless a worthy successor to his earlier works.  <br />The movie is sharp, with a very definitive, high-tech look and feel.  Unlike its predecessors, it does not have a lot of character development in it, save for a very poorly developed relationship between John Connor (played by Nich Stahl) and Kate Brewster (played by Claire Daines), who will eventually become Connor's wife (presumably in Terminator 4).  The characters are the weakest part of the script, and that stands out as a notable weakness in the film.  One example is when the Terminator explains that Brewster is to become Connor's wife, she is completely repulsed by the idea, having just seen her fiancee get killed, and having been kidnapped by Connor.  Throughout the film, she faces more despair, watching the new Terminator (Kristianna Loken) murder her father, and yet, only moments later, she finds herself in Connors arms, and they share a romantic kiss.  With no offense to the screenwriter, people aren't usually overly romantic in the face of armageddon, or in the face of recently losing loved ones, especially one's fiancee and husband within 24 hours of one another, but okay, its only a movie.<br />What makes this movie work is the comedic timing of many of Schwarzenegger's lines and situations.  When he travels back through time, he finds himself inside a strip club during a male review.  Most of the memorable lines belong to Arnold, who still looks dominant in the role of the Terminator that he created 20 years earlier.<br />Of course this is a big-budget sci-fi/action flick with many high budget effects.  The new Terminator (Loken) looks slick and sensual, combining the appeal of a woman with the lethal force of a killing machine with a one-tracked mind.  <br />The opening and closing sequences are probably the most haunting,
B00008PX8P|5.0|BEING 47 YEARS OLD ZEPPELIN WAS MY BAND GROWING UP.I CAN`T IMAGINE GETTING A BETTER GIFT THAN THE RELEASE OF THIS DVD PACKAGE.THANK YOU JIMMY PAGE.IF YOU ARE A LED ZEPPELIN FAN,YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS.BUT IF YOUR SITTING ON THE FENCE,GET THIS AND YOU WON`T BE SORRY.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Having been an avid fan of the horror genre for more than 20 years, I can say objectively that \\"The Fog\\" remains in my mind one of the true cornerstones of this genre.  The film, abandoned and largely forgotten by viewers and the film industry for many years, has the mixed feel of an independent film done on a big budget.  The result is classic horror; at times campy, at times dramatic, and at times genuinely terrifying.<br />A cast of characters played by such horror veterans as Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau and Janet Leigh guide the story of a seaside town, Antonio Bay, which is about to celebrate the centennial of its birth. On the eve of its anniversary, an unearthly fog rolls in off the ocean, bringing with it a derelict clipper ship and a crew of leperous ghosts, returned from the dead to exact revenge on six conspirators that caused their ship to wreck one hundred years earlier.  Rounding out the cast are many of Carpenter's standard players: Nancy Loomis (Halloween/Halloween II), Tom Atkins (Halloween III, Season of the Witch) & Charles Cyphers (Halloween/Halloween II). Screen legends Hal Holbrook and John Houseman also appear, bringing a level of intelligence and depth to the film that many horror movies of that period lacked.<br />What seperates \\"The Fog\\" from other films is that it goes beyond the slasher genre, and attempts to touch at many of the primal fears we all have.  Like its predecessor, Halloween, this film also focuses on character development, allowing the viewers to feel genuine empathy for these characters as they move through the film.  <br />The DVD version of this film has restored the film quality to rival that of any film produced today.  The colors are rich, the sound is crisp and the films appearance is fresh and clean.  The extras on the disc are fun, especially the interviews with Debra Hill, Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh.  <br />From the first time I saw this film as a teenager, tuning in to it on a Saturday afternoon matinee on a local television station, to this newest release of DVD, the Fog has lost none of its vitality.  I have seen no less than 100 horror films, having perused such classics as Psycho and The Haunting and many classic series including all 7 of the Nightmare on Elm Street Series, all 10 of the Friday the 13th series, the Hellraiser series, and of course the Halloween series to name but a few, and I can say objectively that the Fog remains a film to rival any of these.<br />So next time you are in the mood for a horror movie, a ghost story, or just a good thrill, choose \\"The Fog.\\"
B0000017CA|5.0|Acis Bath is awesome, this was there first cd  and i like it better than Pagean Terrorism Tactics. I dont own PTT but ive listen to all of it and i like it alot but this is better in my opinion. There is fast parts and mellow parts and both parts rule. Mellow songs are Scream Of The Butterfly and Bones Of Baby Dolls and the rest of them are fast and heavy. I cant pick a best or worse song cause i love all of them.
B00005JKG7|5.0|A sleepy sea-side town.  A hundred year old mystery.  <br />John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" is the stuff of great ghost stories.  The town of Antonio Bay, founded by settlers in the late 1800's is about to celebrate its centennial anniversary.  As the church bells ring at midnight, an unearthly fog rolls in off the Pacific, carrying within it a ghost ship and a crew of men exacting revenge on the conspirators that caused their ship to crash against the rocks a century earlier.  <br />The film is another product of Debra Hill and John Carpenter, the duo who were responsible for the original and highly successful independent film, \\"Halloween.\\"  Filmed in much the same style as Halloween, the movie focuses on character development through crafty storytelling.  As is common in Carpenter films, many of the principal actors are veterans of his earlier work.  In this instance, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) returns to the screen in one of the films lead role, accompanied by veteran actress and mother Janet Leigh (perhaps best known for her role in Psycho.)  The cast is rounded out by many other regulars: Charles Cyphers (Halloween I and II), Nancy Loomis (Halloween I and II), Tom Atkins (Halloween III), as well as a cast of well known stars from that period: John Houseman, Adrienne Barbeau and Hal Holbrook.<br />The film works because it relies on characters that the audience can relate to and care about.  Additionally, the film does not rely on graphic violence or gore, but instead uses subtlety and atmosphere to create the intense and often terrifying appearance of the vengeful Blake and his crew.<br />This movie, recently released on DVD, has been remastered, providing a beautiful digital transfer, which allowed for crisp video and sound that gives the film an appearance of being new, not a piece filmed nearly 25 years ago.  Only the costume and period dialog will remind the audience that this film is not new.  Even the special effect sequences are well done, considering the age of the film.<br />I have been an avid fan of the horror genre for nearly 20 years, and I can say objectively that I have seen most of the mainstream horror films that are out on the market today.  \\"The Fog\\" remains a cornerstone of the genre, transcending the ordinary horror film into something more; a journey into our own fear that the truth is out there, whether we want to face it or not.<br />This movie is a must-see and well worth the time.
B00006CXXU|2.0|Yes I gave it a 2 even  if technically this girl can sing. She has vocal control, a pretty good range, and it's obvious that she has a few other good technical qualites. However, her singing bores me. There seems to be little or no communication with who she is singing to. It is all about her, listen to what her voice can do and how strong she is. She won't let you forget that she can \\"outsing\\" her peers. Let's not get art mixed up with competiton. Although, she is quoted as having a \\"soulful voice\\" this is mainly because she uses a lot of vocal emphasis throughout her songs, which half of the time sounds like shouting. Is that truly soulful? <br />It is obvious that her idols are Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, because she uses some of the Mariah type mid-range humming at some points, and belting at others. It's also a bit obvious that she has listened to Pat Benatar, who was one of the first rock/pop musicians to be praised for her octives. Except Pat comes across with more honesty. However, Ms Aguilera fails to really develop a personal, unique way of singing that is her signature, it sounds like a lot of vocal acrobatics sung without feeling behind it.  <br />Now for the content itself, well I guess we can't be too hard on her here, because she didn't write it by herself, not that anyone should be overly proud of this so called \\"art\\". The song \\"dirrty\\" explain that to me as an \\"art form\\" At least Madonna had the irony to sing about being a virgin in a metaphorical way. Ms Aguilera uses the \\"shock technique\\" just plain and simple smut lyrics with nothing left to the imagination. The song \\"get mine, get yours\\" what is she trying to prove, that she is above Britney Spears because she can sing about casual sex and that is her ticket out of pop princessdom. Please Christina, not a mature approach at all. <br />For some of the other songs \\"beautiful\\" \\"loving me for me\\" and \\"soar\\" are just plain trite and cliche. In other words, contrived and insipid. They are supposed to be the signature songs to show that she has \\"depth\\" and \\"comes from her heart\\" And fighter, the \\"woman power song\\" been there, done that. Again, Pat Benatar said most of this in her song \\"heartbreaker\\" Nothing new here. <br />Maybe Christina would have a better chance of doing a powerful truthful piece of work, if it were not so contrived. It's obvious by the group of people assembled to produce this record, that the whole idea was to get some credabilty.
0800177177|4.0|The main reaasons for seeing this film are based around the craft of filmmaking itself, as the sets, costumes, cinematography, and score are all excellent. This film won many \\"technical\\" Oscars, and with good reason. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. <br />The actual acting and script are not bad, though a little overdone on both accounts. That's the greatest weakness of the film, the pacing is uneven, and the dialog and acting can be a bit hammy.<BR> <BR>Now, as for its closeness to the original novel, well, its hardly exact, but the main changes related to the romance are not unprecedented. Dracula has become an increasingly sympathetic character in each film version produced. The rest of the details are fairly close, however, with the vast majority of the books cast included, unlike most film versions. (The reviewer of July 2 2003 form Australia is wrong, Coppola didn't add the Texan, Quincey Morris is a character straight from the original book.) The inclusion of Stoker's name in the title was done largely for copyright reasons, and invariably gives a false impression that this is a 100% faithful adaptation. <BR> <BR>So,in short, this is an enjoyable version of the classic tale that strives for a great artistic statement, but could have used a better script.
B000069AUI|4.0|THE SCIENTIST is the 4th track on this CD.  I heard it one time on the radio and new I had to buy the CD.  That one song is that good and my whole reason for owning the CD.  That being said, I also found POLITIK surprisingly good on the first go around.  Of course everyone is familiar with CLOCKS by now because it's all over the radio, but THE SCIENTIST is the stand-out song in my opinion.  It's the kind of sad, haunting music that gives you a heavy heart and makes you think of every special girl you ever broke up with.  The rest of the tracks didn't really do it for me.
0385334206|3.0|After reading Galapagos and Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions poorly portray's the brilliance of Kurt Vonnegut.  The story drags and seems inadequate.<BR> It does pick up at the end though, where it somewhat redeems itself. Vonnegut's typical skewed view of the world narrates you through the story of two strangers who have alot more to do with each other than they know of. Vonnegut shares with the readers his view on life.
0736041850|5.0|The illustrations are phenomenal. This is defacto standard training manual that I use.<br />PICTURES speak a thousand words.<br />The only negative is that not every muscle is shown, but I know it's not a physiology book.<br />RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!1
B00005JLXE|2.0|My hopes for this movie were shattered.  It was extremely fake.  I didn't like the whole \\"I want revenge\\"  thing.  It took the \\"superhero\\" out of Daredevil.  The stunts and moves, as well at the scenery were so bogus.  I felt like I was watching a CGI movie rather than a superhero thriller.  <br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  It was quite violent!  That was something I didn't expect.<br />Take my advice, save your money and spend it on something useful.  This movie is not worth it.  Not you money, your time, or your energy.
B00003CWLF|3.0|Not too accurate with the story. It's nice and dramatic. forgettable movie. Prepare to be bored for long stretches.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing that they were a pretty good band and hearing a couple of their songs.  I just could not resist it.  This is an incredible CD.  Here's what I think of it song-by-song:<br />\\"Going Under\\": Amy is a bit low for her vocal range at first it sounds like, but then she breaks out the high notes and the album takes off running.  4.5/5<br />\\"Bring Me To Life\\": The song that most people know them by.  Amy starts out belting out those high notes, and I absolutely love it.  This was the first song I heard of theirs, and fell in love.  Her voice mixes with the guest artist's so well.  5/5<br />\\"Everybody's Fool\\": This one starts where Bring Me To Life left off.  They sound so similar that the transition could easily be made seamless with just small editing.  The lyrics are great, everything is great.  5/5<br />\\"My Immortal\\": The song that convinced me that I just had to have this album.  Amy's voice is so perfect over the piano, and eventually the strings.  This song sends chills up and down my spine every time I hear it, not to mention that the lyrics rock.  When combined with Bring Me To Life and Everybody's Fool, this is the best 11 minutes in music history, I think.  Very inspiring.  8/5<br />\\"Haunted\\": My least favorite song on the album.  I don't know why I don't like it, it just doesn't float my boat.  Still a wonderful song, though.  4/5<br />\\"Tourniquet\\": I can't emphasize this enough; I love Amy's voice!!  This is a cry out to God for salvation.  Beautiful, descriptive lyrics.  4.5/5<br />\\"Imaginary\\": This is also a bit of an odd song.  However, it does work for Amy's haunting voice.  Beautiful.  4.5/5<br />\\"Taking Over Me\\": Another wonderful song that you can listen to again and again.  This one really has a bit of a different sound than anything else on the album.  I like it.  4.5/5<br />\\"Hello\\": Some people have said they don't like this song, and that she's a schizophreniac or something.  After listening to it, I've found that it hasa rather catchy tune, and that she's just swimming in her memories.  Another song where Amy is singing over a piano.  5/5<br />\\"My Last Breath\\": This one has almost a techno feel to it in the beginning, but then the guitars hit you like a wave, but then Amy's voice comes in like a breath of fresh air.  Altogether, this song works perfectly with the CD.  Perhaps its not a very original theme, but that can be forgiven since its such a good song.  5/5<br />\\"Whisper\\": Not only the last song on the CD, but also the longest.  This one really brings back the idea of \\"Fallen\\" with its lyrics.  The chorus is very catchy.  You may find yourself singing it in the shower if you're not careful!  5/5<br />I truthfully feel that this is the best [money] that I've ever spent.  Amy has an incredible voice, which is so rare these days in the professional music industry, sad to say.  From \\"Bring Me To Life\\" to \\"My Immortal\\", Evanescence shows their diversity and capabilities with this freshman release.  It should be a crime not to own this CD.
0380789035|2.0|I love the premise, but the writing here is clumsy. The characters are all skeletons--the cool hippie hitchiker, the small town old man who talks in shaggy-dog tale stories, the drunken irishman. It almost seems like Gaiman is unintentionally spoofing himself. And the characters break  so far out of character that it  made me want to throw the book away on several occaisions.<br />Example: \\"Lives are like snowflakes--forming patterns we have seen before, as like on another as peas in a pod (and have you ever looked at peas in a pod? I mean, really LOOKED at them? There's not a chance you'd mistake one for another, after a minute's close inspection)...\\" The voice is that of Ibis, but the parenthetical statement here sounds like Gaiman himself. I find it hard to believe that Ibis, a god who writes the stories of all living beings, would either use italics (capitalized above as \\"LOOKED\\"), or ask the reader such a casual question. Stephen King, maybe. A god, no.<br />I find it very hard to believe that American reading public has overlooked Gaiman's poor skills as a writer in deference to his very interesting premise. But it seems they have. If you like Everybody loves Raymond, Khakis with Pleats, and McGriddles then buy this book. If you have slightly higher standards then skip it. It is trash, pure and simple, and not even the good kind.
B0000024RQ|5.0|A wonderful album; the first I've heard of Dylan's work and an excellent album to begin with. Favorite tracks include &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,&quot; &quot;Bob Dylan's Blues,&quot; and &quot;Oxford Town.&quot; The sound is simple but certainly does not need to be any more elaborate than it already is. Dylan's voice seems to draw the listener more so than his acoustic ever could, ranging from goofy and fun (&quot;Oxford Town&quot;) to a pleading melancholy (&quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;), and makes each song, whether amusing or thought provoking, fantastic. Not much else to say other than it is, once again, a wonderful album. Worth it.
B00005AQGH|5.0|i thought this cd was so tight the first time i heard it.i was so mad when jay-z made the \\"03' bonnie and clyde\\" song. why can't he come up with his own songs. no matter how many times he tries to remake \\"ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND\\", it will never ever be as tight as 2pac's. and also when he made \\"excuse me miss\\" he got some lyrics from notorious B.I.G. and i don't know why jay-z made a tribute to 2pac on his last concert.(roc da mic tour)if 2pac hated jay-z. he said so in +bomb first+ no matter what anyone says 2pac will always be da best.+~+~+R.I.P.+~+~+

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna \\"Music\\" experiments with many different techno sounds in her second techno-themed album.  This gives the album the added edge to keep the dance floor hopping.  She proves that a performer can return to their musical roots, yet continue to evolve.  She keeps the unique sound and acts.  Despite its dance theme, she continues to sing her heart and soul about issues that she strongly feels: sexism, music importance, love, yearning, etc.  <br />A list of different genres she combines with techno:<BR>-Music-DJ mixing<BR>-Impressive Instant-hardcore trance<BR>-Runaway Lover-electronica<BR>-I Deserve It-folk<BR>-It's Amazing-DJ mixing<BR>-Nobody's Perfect-robotics<BR>-Don't Tell Me-hip hop, country<BR>-What It Feels Like For a Girl-ambient<BR>-Paradise(Not For Me)-ambient<BR>-Gone-folk<br />Such musical variety makes an album more enjoyable.  It separates it from her previously known \\"Ray of Light\\" sound and theme, spirituality.  This is an album for all fans of Madonna and techno/dance music.  \\"Music\\" is more than just music, it's an unforgettable experience no one will forget or leave disappointed.  Those who want to keep the dance floor hopping after this album should also buy her other two techno-themed albums: \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"American Life\\".
0385504209|3.0|A murder victim's last desperate effort to pass along an ancient secret kicks off a real page-turner of a thriller.  Dan Brown does a masterful job of weaving art history, symbology, and ancient Christian rumors and conspiracy theories into a compelling murder mystery.  The rich detail built into each chapter has the reader all but booking travel to Paris and London to experience the settings and the history; the provocative thesis surrounding the Holy Grail will have the reader searching the web and amazon.com for additional information.<br />So why only 3 stars?  Other critical reviewers have correctly blasted the way Brown hits the reader over the head Heinlein-style with his lectures and theories-as-fact. As the plot progresses talk supplants action (a huge no-no for murder mysteries); the story timeline is actually faster than the elapsed time required to read the book.  Robert Langdon goes from professor to suspect-on-the-run back to professor, and the book grinds to a monotonous crawl as a result.<br />In addition Brown asks the reader to suspend belief too many times.  In the opening scene a masterpiece is ripped from the wall of the Louvre, followed by approximately 15-20 minutes of (implied) dialog, a shooting, and some fancy multi-layered puzzle set-up.  Reality would seem to dictate that half the Paris police would arrive within 90 seconds of the alarm going off.  Later police let Langdon, now a suspected high-profile mass murderer, escape not once but twice, and still later police let a hulking albino shoot his way out of a trap and, while seriously wounded, carry an injured bystander into a hospital and then walk out.  Yeah right.  And don't even get me started about \\"The Teacher\\".<br />Perhaps the most serious fault, however, is the lack of character development.  As implausible as it sounds, we learn more about the albino assassin than anyone else.  In a normal murder mystery this wouldn't be an issue, but given the nature of Brown's central thesis character development is an absolute must.  Without giving too much away, the ending only makes sense (and, in hindsight, the book is only satisfying) if we learn far more about the character with the famous lineage.

B000002H70|5.0|There's lot of reviews titled that way.  The thing is that it's true.  What, better than the Beatles?  Sure, tell me there aren't weak spots on the White Album.  There are none here, this is a seamless work of art that conveys the full drama of life and the sorrow of how quickly it passes.  <br />With Trilogy being released, it's a good time to remember how great this is.  I predict people will be listening to this album hundreds of years from now, wondering who that genius was pictured on the cover, peering up from underneath the flowers.
0792164903|5.0|`The legend of Sleepy Hollow' is one of those stories that everyone has known for as long as they can remember, and because everyone knows it, it is sometimes hard to step away from the big picture and understand why this story peaks the interest of so many. Really though, it's quite simple; the intrigue behind this timeless story is it's villain - The Headless Horseman. His story and origin mysterious and dark, and motivation unimaginable it is no wonder that the Horse Man has an apparent gift for captivating audiences. <br />Played by the brilliant character actor, Christopher Walken, in Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sleepy Hollow story, he is as fierce and menacing as ever. Burton's version of the story is not entirely accurate; however, seeing as everyone knows the original story maybe his decision to meddle with the details was a wise one.  <br />Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane; a constable from New York City sent to investigate the gruesome murders of three residents of a town called Sleepy Hollow. Crane's cowardly distaste for the way of life in quiet Sleepy Hollow is Burton's way of paralleling Crane's status as an unsociable schoolteacher in the original story, and thus giving him the same personality. <br />Christina Ricci is the beautiful, young daughter of Baltus Van Tassel (head of one of two wealthy families in the town). Mistaking Crane for her fiancé in one of the first scenes, she kisses him while blindfolded and commences Crane's infatuation with her and her \\"white magic\\". <br />Similar to a lot of Burton's other movies in that it is quirky in the best sense of the word, `Sleepy Hollow' doesn't waste too much time with characters that deny the possible existence of a supernatural being such as The Headless Horseman. Instead, it gets right to the heart of the story, which is, of course, based primarily on the supernatural. <br />Between the classic, creepy story, flawless atmosphere and talented actors, `Sleepy Hollow' has earned itself a place among the rare breed of horror movie that succeeds at being both gory and good. Although Ricci isn't horrible, it is hard not to be outshined by someone as limitless as Johnny Depp - who plays his part with an odd sort of comedy that successfully saves this dark fairytale from being too grim. <br />I whole-heartedly give this movie five stars.
0553213105|5.0|Well, I first read Pride and Prejudice while in 10th grade and I fell in love with the book and its characters.  I finished it in about 2 days while the rest of my class were reading the required amount each day.  Lol, I became very ahead of my class for this book.<br />  The book is just so universal.  It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time.  Which is why I related to it, I could see what happened in the book could very likely happen in my time(and I wouldn't mind it happening to me, ;).)<br />  Also, I like the strength of Elizabeth's character. She is smart and witty and has a mind of her own.  She doesn't allow her mother to pressure her into anything she doesn't want.<br />  I highly recommend this book, so go out and read it today,....
0767802519|5.0|I'm not talking about the gunshots. This movie is so great with the characters, sometimes it doesn't need dialogue, but then again, the dialogue is so well scripted, this film should be studied and highly regarded among others.  Luc Bresson did a fantastic job with this film, I notice and feel the emotions of it, throught the characters and the images, every time I watch it. If you haven't seen it, check it, and look deep into the story that is so carefully crafted, it's contains all the things that EXCELLENT movies are made out of. I'd watch it over many times, as I feel each and every time I reach the end of this film. Bravo to Luc Bresson for this wonderful film.

B00005JLXE|1.0|\\"Daredevil\\" is one of the worst movies of 2003.  Despite being based on a very interesting comic character, and following one of the better story arcs in that character's universe, the movie simply fails on just about every level, except for set design and cinematography.  It wasn't even that successful at the box office, which makes this 2-Disc edition that pulls out all the stops so surprising.  FOX does a much better job with this release than Columbia did with \\"Spider-Man\\", which was a MUCH better film.<br />First, the movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, blind crusading lawyer by day, superhero crusader in NY's Hell's Kitchen by night.  The movie does a very good job setting up the origin story, and then collapses in it's own bloated storytelling.  See Murdoch was blinded by a freak toxic spill as a boy, which has enhanced his other four senses in such a way that he basically sees better than those with functioning eyes.  He became a lawyer to right the wrongs of the world, apparently, though he's not a prosecutor per se, which would seem ideal for a young man out to see justice done, though the first time we see Matt he appears to be prosecuting a rapist.  Why?  Maybe he moonlights at the DA's when not working at his own Law Firm.  It's a tad confusing.  He even lets up on the rapist in court specifically so he can kill the guy later.  So he's a different hero-he kills people.  (Batman was never supposed to be a killer, by the way).<br />Anyway, one day he and his law partner are eating breakfast when Jennifer Garner walks in.  Matt smells her perfume so he knows she's a hottie, and proceeds to try and find out who she is.  Her name is Elektra, and he father is a big Corporate type.  This is important because dear old dad has ties to the Kingpin, played much too genially by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Kingpin is the source of all crime in New York, sort of like Professor Moriarty was the source of all crime in the world of Sherlock Holmes, only Matt Murdoch is no Holmes, and the Kingpin breaks people in half.  He's connected to Murdoch's past in a way that is so obvious you aren't sure if the filmmakers are trying to be clever and failing, or just being sloppy.  Anyway, Daredevil starts messing around in Kingpin's business, so he calls in Bullseye, an Irish assasin played by talentless Irish actor Colin Farrell who can hit just about any target and has a bulls-eye scar in his forehead.  Colin Farrell must have made some kind of classic deal with the devil, in which he gets to be in a lot of movies, but they all stink, as he in NOT a talented actor but the press loves him.  Anyway, Elektra gets involved through a dumb plot contrivance and becomes an assasin.  All of this leads up to...not much.  As I said before, not a whole lot really takes place in this movie.  It's trying to be about bigger things than action, like love, duty, honor, and justice.<br />These characters do talk alot, which is a mjor mistake when you cast Affleck in the lead.  Garner displays almost none of the charm she has in \\"Alias\\", or even in her brief but impressive cameo in \\"Catch Me If You Can\\".  The makeup people have also found a way to make her look unatractive, which I would have thought impossible, but they do.  The talks between Murdoch and Elektra are poorly scipted attempts at serious romance between too hurt souls, and come off as trite.  Colin Farell hams it up enough to keep him from being too annoying.  The biggest waste is Duncan as Kingpin, who is not writen nearly menacing enough and seems more like a genial tough guy than a criminal overlord.<br />The film was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a Daredevil fan, he claims, who's only other credit is Simon Birch.  He shows very little action skill here, as even the potentially excellent set pieces he sets up in a church organ are sloppy and he uses CGI effects like a crutch.  Plus, he seems to have given Murdoch powers he never had in the comic, such as flight, or so it appears.  The film does look good and dark, stealing a page from Burton's \\"Batman\\", who is very similar to Daredevil in motivation, so your eyes may have a good time.  But as a movie, \\"Daredevil\\" is a resounding disapointment in story, acting, and executuion.<br />The DVD itself is surprisingly excellent, with in depth looks at the creation of various aspects of the film, music videos, some comic-to-screen transfers, and a Jennifer Garner Screen test that lets you see her natural beauty in a way the filmmakers chose to hide for some unkown reason.  Anyway, X2 redeemed FOX's Comic book film hold, so wait for the big edition of that one.  This film is a dissapointment.ars.

0140067477|4.0|A warm summer day on vacation, with nothing to do and The Tao of Pooh in hand, is a pefect time for this quick read with an important message. Nothing to do is not what it seems. This quiet, open space is the place to find that bear of small brain but big heart. As the fox says in The Little Prince, \\"Here is my secret, a very simple secret. It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Winnie the Pooh, as interpreted by Benjamin Hoff, would agree that the Tao (way) can only be found in what Yeats calls the \\"deep heart's core.\\"<br />As children we all started with a good heart, but somewhere along the way we became confused with too much to do and too little time. But the heart knows that we have all the time there is in the eternal present. We need to discover, as ee cummings says, how \\"To be nobody but 'ourself' in a world that is night and day trying to make 'us' just like everybody else.\\" Nothing to do will give us a chance find ourself and to experience with this discovery the \\"peace which passes all undertanding.\\"<br />Our first tendency will be to begin thinking of the right answer, like owl, or to start immediately doing something, like rabbit. We need to turn off the thinking and doing machine, which is the foundation of our Western Culture, and instead, practice leaving things alone, that is doing nothing, as Lao-tse would recommend in The Tao Te Ching, tne basis for Hoff's The Tao of Pooh.<br />In Hermann Hesse's great little book, Siddhartha, only at the end of his life, sitting by the river, doing nothing but listening quietly to the river flowing by him as he sat on the grass, did Siddharth finally attain enlightenment and an understanding of himself and his place in the world.<br />On our own vacation on a warm summer's day with the Tao of Pooh in hand, perhaps we will begin to listen quietly to \\"the sound of lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore\\" as we discover what is in our deep heart's core.core.
B00000K19E|1.0|People thought Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey was confusing. This movie takes the cake. I'm a smart guy, I have a graduate degree, but this film just seems to lack any substance. It's all Kung Fu fighting and special effects thrown in for good measure. The second Matrix film isn't any better which I saw at the theater. The film doesn't come across as clever, nor intellectual and it isn't even a very good action film or science fiction film for that matter. I know a lot of people seem to like this mess of a film, but save your money. I don't really think it is a film that will be regarded like 2001 A Space Odyssey 20 years from now. I'm afraid it may be forgotten.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I can say a million great things about this album...but mainly I wanna say AWESOME!  It's not very often that an artist writes ALL of the songs on the album, especially his FIRST one!  Every word that comes out of his mouth is heartfelt and true.  I bought one copy the day it came out, and a few more the next day so that everywhere I go, I will have it.  Yes, it is THAT GOOD!  He has a wonderful, unique voice, and his work on that piano of his is absolutely amazing!  If you don't already have one, buy it, and if you have one, go get more! Oh yea, go see him in concert, too!!! Thanx!<BR>~Shari
B00006RU5B|3.0|I liked this CD, because I'm a fan of Sound Garden. But I think the production is weak. Like so many bands these days... the sound to me is bland, nothing really punches threw. Even Chris's great voice needs something more. (Show me how to live) is one the best songs on this CD, with the most stupid guitar solo I've ever heard. Come on Bro, your not in Rage any more... back up your great guitar riff's with a tasty solo. Good guitar riff's are few and far between these day's enough. This CD could have been great.

B00005JLXE|4.0|My opinion is that all these comic book movies should have one goal: Create a movie just as good as Spider-Man. Daredevil falls short of Spider-Man, they have a long way to go to make this as good as Spider-Man.  Daredevil is very dark and awefully violent, but it's darkness is what gives the movie character.  This movie will probably never be better than Spider-Man, or X-Men, or The Incredible Hulk for that matter, but it's better than Blade, and the recent Batman movies.  This movie overall wasn't terrific, but I remember leaving the first X-men movie a little dissapointed.  But of course I was blown away by the second movie X2: X-men United.  So I'd be willing to give Daredevil 2 a try, when a movie has a lot of flaws that leaves a lot of oppertunities to fix things.
0446310786|5.0|I've probably read over 1,000 novels and though I love to read them, very few get my unqualified approval.  When a novel breaks into my top ten, it's a big event.  When a novel contends for my number one spot, it's an earth-shaking event in my world of books.  Such was the case when I recently read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for the first time.  <br />The writing and the novelistic construction are near-perfect.  But it was the emotional evocativeness that impressed me the most.  The characters of Scout, Jem, Atticus, Calpurnia, and several others are flawless.  This is a masterful work of art.<br />So much has been said about this book in the many reviews here, I will add only this observation.  I think readers are often too young when they read this book for the first time to fully appreciate all its merits.  It's not a difficult read, and the moral lessons are so obvious and impressive that young readers do appreciate the book, and I feel it is good that they read it.  But other features, such as the fine and subtle nuances of the relations among the children, and between the children and the adults, are not fully appreciated by the younger readers.  Therefore this book should be read again (and again) at various points in one's life.  It will reveal greater nuance and depth with more mature readings.  <br />This is a book for the ages.  Thank you Harper Lee.
B00003CXTG|1.0|My brother and I started watching this movie. We could barely get through it. We watched the first hour and turned it off. It was that bad. I was opened minded about it. Gave it an hour of a chance. The movie is like a soap opera. Bad all the way around. I guess some people might like it. I thought the writing was terrible. Makes you wince. The pace was slow and you don't care about the characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Pearl Jam achieved perfection on 3 albums; Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy.  Ten was the commercial sucess, Vs. was a glimpse into the bands anger and rage, and lastly Vitalogy was the album that went into the heart of what Pearl Jam was truly about.  The album delves beyond hard core rock songs and grunge ballads into the enigma which is Pearl Jam.  Vitalogy is at times baffling, confusing and hard to grasp but at the same time the music is so rewarding and deep.  &quot;Immortality, &quot;Satans Bed&quot;, and &quot;Corduroy&quot;, to name a few represent not the fading grunge era measured by time or teenage angst but by the emotions a truly great album can evoke.  Vitalogy shouldn't be bought by true grunge fans but by true Pearl Jam fans.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Was there ever any doubt that \\"How the west was won\\" would live up to all of the hype.  We have heard Led Zeppelin live before with the BBC Sessions, and Song Remains the Same, but there is something unique about this collection.  The three cd's contain live tracks, hand picked by Page, from the band's 1972 concert tour.  You can feel the raw energy and power that was, and still is, Led Zeppelin.  If you are a long time Zep fan, than you have heard all of these songs before, so I won't waste time looking at every song, but here are some of the highlights:<br />Immigrant Song-What a powerful song to kick off the CD<br />Over the Hills- Just a beautiful song and it sounds great live.<br />Since I've Been Loving You- Always my favorite.  Out of this world<br />Stairway- just phenomenal<br />Going to California-has a great, summertime feel to it, and the crowd loves it<br />Dazed and Confused- 25 minutes of mayhem;  what a great song<br />Moby Dick-  John Bonham shows why he is the greatest rock and roll drummer of all time.<br />Whole Lotta Love-Another long song (23 min)that oozes sexual energy.  This is actually of medley of some old blues songs.<br />Overall, this is one of the greatest live cd's ever made.  This is the band at there best.  And if you want even more, go buy the DVD.  It's more of the same, high-octane, non-stop rock and roll.  Both are well worth the money.

B000089RVX|5.0|I think that Amy Lee, the vocalist, is very deep. She has her own thing going on and she is proud of it. Parents (like me) will hate the music because the genre is called heavy metal/rock. But, the lyrics always have a meaning to them. After the lyrics are heard, the parents should and probably will allow their children to become Evanescence fans.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck is an amazing artist.  This album sounds like Beck's most personal album.  I've had Sea Change for a couple of months now and I am still addicted to it.  You will want to listen to it all of the time once it gets hold of you.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I love Soundgarden and I love Rage Against the Machine but this album was a let down on so many levels.  Most would assume that if you combine two great elements from two great bands you would get a decent product in return however this wasnt the case.  Audioslave's debut album is in no way a bad album just a dissapointing one.  All the songs felt so flat and unispired compared to past rage or soundgarden material.  Cornell's voice and Morello's guitars never seemed to shine on this c.d. and the whole experience was quite lackluster. I can only hope in future recordings the band can recapture what truly made them great in the first place.
0393307050|3.0|Some well-read friends suggested I try O'Brian's Jack Aubrey novels, so I've read the first in the series, \\"Master and Commander.\\"  I'm not sure I understand what my friends see in it.  While the battle scenes are vivid, much of the narrative is bogged down with nearly incomprehensible naval language.  Here is a typical passage:<br />\\"Hitch on the runners,\\" said Jack.  \\"No, farther out.  Half way to the second quarter.  Surge the hawser and lower away.\\"  The yard came down on deck and the carpenter hurried off for his tools.  \\"Mr Watt,\\" said Jack to the bosun.  \\"Just rig me the brace-rendants, will you?\\"  The bosun opened his mouth, shut it again and bent slowly to his work:  anywhere outside Bedlam brace-pendants were rigged after the horses, after the stirrups, after the yard-tackle pendants (or a thimble for a tackle-hook, if preferred):  and none of them, ever, until the stop-cleat, the narrow part for them all to rest upon, had been worked on the sawn-off end and provided with a collar to protect them from drawing against the middle. (p. 79)<br />This sort of thing goes on for over 400 pages.<br />If it floats your boat, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book.  Otherwise, you may find yourself a bit at sea.<br />Addendum:  I saw the film when it first came out, and found it great fun.  Of course, the movie is a composite of a couple of the novels, and the \\"Master and Commander\\" title is therefore a bit misleading.  But in a world where there's too much to read and not enough time in which to read it, I think I'll pass on the other Aubrey novels and look forward to more movies.  At least then, I can more easily ignore the language I do not understand.
0452257743|5.0|Wow.  I am amazed by these stories that Stephen King wrote so early in his carreer.  They are all impressive and well written.  They all have lasting impact.  The first two are excellent psychological thrillers, complete with plenty of interesting philosophy.  The third is a slow moving, character analysis of a schizophrenic.  The final story is a fast moving action story.  All of the stories are excellent.<br />Rage(5/5)- This is the reason that you won't be finding this anthology in stores.  This story is about a school shooting incident.  In it, a boy named Charlie Decker takes over his class after shooting his math teacher.  I know it sounds ludacrously violent, but it isn't.  There aren't many deaths, but alot of excitement and plenty of philosophy.  It is told from the first-person (unusual for King) point of view of a killer.  You get to watch his sanity slowly slip away.  Very intriguing.<br />The Long Walk(5/5)- A tie with Rage for my favorite Bachman Book.  This one involves a grim future in the style of my favorite book, 1984.  In this grim, 1984-esque, future, there is a marathon held every year with 100 boys starting off on the U.S.-Canada border and they simply walk.  If they go below 4mph for 30 seconds they recieve a warning.  If they walk for one hour without a fresh warning they lose an old warning.  If they acumulate three warnings, then stop again, they recieve a ticket a.k.a. a bullet in the head.  This is the story of one walker - Ray Garraty - who enters the contest.  He and others, including Pete McVries, Hank Olson, Art Baker, Barkovitch, and Stebbins.  A bit predictable, but haunting and disturbing.<br />Roadwork(4/5)-  This one is interesting.  It isn't the best in the collection, but it is still an excellent story.  It is a character analysis of a schizophrenic man pushed over the verge.  The stoy involves a man named Bart whose house and business are threatened by a new construction project.  He speaks to his dead son Charlie in his head.  It should be known that in these conversations, Bart is George and Charlie is Fred (they called each other by their middle names).<br />The Running Man(4/5)-  A fast paced story about a game show in the future where a man tries to avoid assassins.  It is similar to The Long Walk just as Roadwork is similar to Rage.  I like it, I just wish it had more of the philosophy that the others had.  This one would be the best for young or immature readers while Roadwork would be really good for serious readers.<br />All in all it is an excellent anthology filled with<BR>(disturbing moments)<BR>Great storytelling.  I really liked King's characterization and philosophy.  The stories are fairly short and can each be read in a single sitting (except maybe Roadwork).  Read 'em.  Ponder 'em.  Love 'em.
B00005JLEX|5.0|To say Seinfeld is an outstanding television series is an understatement. From the first time I started watching reruns of the show about 2 years ago to the present day, I have not been able to get enough of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer. The wit and humor of \\"Seinfeld\\" is unmatched by any other series, past or present, and it will remain as the greatest series in television series for quite some time. From the top-notch writing to the hilarious one-liners to the brilliant supporting cast (Newman, George's parents, Jay Peterman, etc.), this show has it all.<br />What makes \\"Seinfeld\\" so great is the vast amount of classic episodes it had over it's nine seasons. Among my personal favorites include \\"The Soup Nazi\\", \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", \\"The Opposite\\", \\"The Voice\\", \\"The Airport\\", and quite possibly the most memorable 30 minutes in TV history: \\"The Contest\\" (Kramer: \\"I'm out!!\\"). While these are just a few of the classic \\"Seinfeld\\" episodes, there's something in each of the 180 episodes that will make you laugh out loud 'til it hurts.<br />There's no doubt in my mind that when it comes out onto DVD, \\"Seinfeld\\" will be the greatest selling DVD set in history. It's a show about nothing that is full of everything that is wanted in a comedy series: Great acting, hilarious stories, and extremely well-written scripts. Do yourself a favor and pick this up whenever it comes out; it'll be well worth the purchase.

B000001GQU|5.0|Ferenc Fricsay recorded the Requiem twice. This was his first and was recorded in mono in 1953. From the beginning, the interpretation is gripping - at rather fast speeds you are drawn along with the music which, despite the fast pace retains a very spiritual feel. The Dies Irae makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. I never tire of listening to this recording. The mono recording from 1953, although it has its limitations when compared to current standards, is very clear and atmospheric and must surely have been of the very highest standards of the day. Deutsche Grammophon's technique of swinging a large microphone above the orchestra provides depth to the sound. Listening to this recording, you quickly become accustomed to the sound and it does not distract from the superb music making. If you want modern sound, look elsewhere, but if not, like me, I'm sure you'll treasure this recording.<br />I know of only one better recording of the requiem ... that is Fricsay's shattering second 1960 live recording ... but that's another story.

This book is one of the best.<br />The subtitle of the book is telling.  King called this \\"a Memoir of the Craft.\\"  He is an excellent memoirist.<br />The memoir part is fascinating.  King tells us about his life and it's quite an interesting one.  He talks about his youth, about meeting his wife, about his early years and his writing, about his alcoholism, about his near-fatal accident, all enriched with a myriad of details.  This is the stuff of which of which good memoirs are made.<br />Throughout the book, King throws off little droplets of observation about writing and the writer's life.  For example, \\"Writing is a lonely job.  Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference.  They don't have to make speeches.  Just believing is usually enough.\\"<br />That line comes amidst the discussion of meeting his wife and what she's meant to him.  As someone who's been in relationships that were both helpful and not, it resonated with me.  There are insights like that sprinkled throughout the book.  Some of them are about writing.  Others are not.<br />All of this is fascinating, more so because King is an excellent writer, and he conveys a lot with very little verbiage.  But the core of the book is about the craft of writing.  King leads into it in this way.  \\"What follows is everything I know about how to write good fiction.\\"<br />As the subtitle says this is about the craft of writing.  It is about craft, not art, not inspiration, not \\"being a writer.\\"  It is about craft - the work of writing and how to do it well.<br />King lets us in on this hard-core craft focus early on.  \\"There is a muse, but he's not going to come fluttering down to your writing room and scatter creative fairy dust all over your typewriter or the computer station.\\"<br />In other words, folks, King is saying that it is up to you.  Then he gets down to some practical nuts and bolts.  \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others:  read a lot and write a lot.\\"<br />We find out how much King likes to write.  We find out what his rhythm is, and how he alternates periods of intense work with lying fallow.  We find out how important he thinks health and the support of his wife are.  We find out where he thinks you should work.<br />Some of this is very directive.  \\"You need the room, you need the door, and you need the determination to shut the door.  You need a concrete goal, as well.  The longer you keep to these basics, the easier the act of writing will become.  Don't wait for the Muse.\\"<br />While King is specifically directive on some things, his overall tone is quite different.  He tells you what works for him and suggests that you might want to consider it for you.<br />Here's a brief part where King talks about symbolism and theme and how he gets them into his work.  \\"Mostly I don't see stuff like that until the story's done.  Once it is, I'm able to kick back, read over what I've written, and look for underlying patterns.  If I see some (and I almost always do), I can work at bringing them out in a second, more fully realized draft of the story.\\"<br />If you are a working writer, or if you would like to be, this is a great book to read and to return to.  There is a wealth of unvarnished advice from a master writer.  Of all the craft books on my writing shelves, this is the most readable book and it is one of the most helpful.<br />What if you're not interested in writing?  Well, if you read a lot, even if you don't read Stephen King's work, but you're fascinated by the sounds coming out of that writing workshop out back, you'll find this a great read, too.nuts and bolts.  \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others:  read a lot and write a lot.\\" <br />We find out how much King likes to write.

B000089RVX|5.0|I love the CD u can listen though it staight and they are also really good live
B00008WG3U|3.0|Seriously, I'm a liberal, and a vocal critic of George W Bush, and this cd is just a joy for someone like me. Unfortunately, that joy is limited to the lyrics. This is one cd I cannot listen to on the train, because it will distract me from whatever I'm doing, since I'll be paying attention to what Fat Mike is saying and nodding my head. <br />But that's where my respect for the album ends. The music is bland and predictable, there are practically no hooks, and I often found myself feeling good that the vocals drowned everything else out. While I could find myself grooving to this cd, it just gets more and more unlikely as time passes.<br />There are a few songs, like Spearation of Church and Skate (of which I agree, when did punk become so safe), Idiots are taking over, Franco-unamerican and regaining unconsciousness that sound good overall, and Mattersville is just hilarious, but otherwise I could forget the chords and just enjoy the lyrics.<br />I've heard very little of NOFX prior to this, and while I plan of buying some of their older stuff, I just hope this won't be the end of them.
B00004LN16|1.0|Before I begin let me just say, I was once the biggest AC/DC fan in the world.  I've been buying their albums since 1978.  That said, it saddens me to say that this is the last AC/DC album I will ever buy.  Ever since 1983's Flick of the Switch it's been all downhill.  Explain something to me - if you're one of the ones giving this album four and five stars, do you honestly feel this collection of JUNK is as good as Back in Black?  If so, please go see a shrink.  This album wouldn't be worth 50 cents in a dollar store. Where do I start with this mess?  (1)Brian Johnson's voice is shot.  He sounds like an 80 year old lady being strangled.  (2)Angus' riffs are dull dull DULL.  (3)The chorus of each song is repeated constantly (I feel safe in NY CITY, I feel safe in NY City, I feel safe in NY City, etc etc etc).  (4) Phil Rudd (never a great drummer) plays as if he is on 20 doses of codeine, playing the same dull beat for every dragging song.  (Hey Phil - you got arthritis?  How about a drum roll every now and then?)  (5) Lyrics are the dumbest ever (I know that's saying a lot). They sound like they've been written by an angry eleven year old.  (6) There is not ONE remotely interesting song on this album.  The best song on this album is not as good as the worst on For Those About to Rock.  Ain't that sad?<br />As good as Back in Black?  Sure, dude - and Bon Scott is actually still alive and living as a Buddhist monk deep in the Himalaya's.  This is a band that should have given it up after Razor's Edge (1990).  Angus, it was nice knowing you, but check yourself into the nearest rest home - the game's over.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|how to begin....<BR>this movie is one of the most brilliant ideas ever. The plot is basically that society has run amok (more specifically a communist type society)and the children have no ambition nor will to strive for greatness, in order to instill this in them each year one 9th grade class is selected to be sent to an island and with a bag of weapons, food and water given 3 days to kill everyone on the island, if there isnt a winner in 3 days they all die. The story is fast paced and interesting and there is even a body toll listed everytime someone dies.  Be sure to get the UNRATED cut, as every cut version I have seen is lacking at least 20 minutes.
B000089RVX|5.0|they are such a great band both live and the cd is great too.  All of the songs on the CD are great so u can just listen to it straight through
B00009MEA5|2.0|I was told to watch this movie by people claiming it was, &quot;The best ever&quot;, &quot;keeps you on the edge of your seat&quot;, &quot;The ending was amazing&quot;.  I disagreed with all three of those people, especially that last one!<BR>    What starts off as being a highly interesting and thought provoking suspenseful drama, soon turns into predictable and preachy dreck.  The &quot;surprise&quot; ending can be figured out by anyone with a couple of brain cells 45 minutes into the movie.  <br />    The actors were great, but really, if you want a GOOD Alan Parker movie, skip this and rent &quot;Angel Heart&quot;.
B0000025YL|3.0|Okay - this album has its strong points.  The title cut is one of the best songs Accept ever wrote, but at least half this decent (at best) album are nothing special AT ALL.  In fact, overall this is a very mediocre album by a band still trying to find their sound (they found it on Balls to the Wall).  The truth is, the only exceptional song on the album is the title cut - if not for that song this album might have gotten 2 stars.  The other nine tunes define mediocrity.  Worth being in any 80's metalhead's collection, but first try and find it at the discount store.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is the kind of band that intelligent people will enjoy, dummies just don't get it. I like all the tracks on this cd and most are extremely complicated with so many hi's and lo's it leaves me worn out. It simply amazes my how a band can pack so much stuff into thier music. All the members of the band simply shine.<BR>If your looking for a cd to sing along too just forget it, this is a listening album that wraps you up in layer after layer and won't let go, ever. Some parts are just frigging heavy as hell, straight out of the the heaviest bands i've ever heard. Some songs are light and almost airy, a good thing too, nobody could handle all the songs without a mental break ( and still appreciate all the hard work it took to make this album .) If anything could describe tool it's beyond me, they simply define their own style and nothing comes close. If you thought alice in chains dirt album was emotionaly draining, this album will do it too. Excellent album.
0800177975|3.0|This movie should be used in film schools to illustrate the importance of both tone and editing.  Here we have a clever concept, a fun (thought not always clever) script, an appealing star at the top of his game and a top flight action director.<br />There is a good movie in here waiting to be brought out.  I think a director's cut put togther without the incredible time restraints they were under when this was released a decade ago could truly save this movie.  A good editor could easily fix the issues in tone, continuity, and pacing with a few tweaks.<br />I can truly see that, when read on the page, this script looked like a great idea.  Maybe someday someone will have the time and inclination to revist LAH.  But I doubt it...
B000002UAX|4.0|It's true some of these songs could be left out to make a single album, and many reviewers have said that; however, if you read enough of the reviews, you will see some discrepencies between reviewers on which ones should have been kept on the album and the ones that should have been discarded.  I suggest you just listen to it yourself and enjoy it.  It's not the best of the Beatles.  In my opinion, Revolver is but I think you will find some songs you will like.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is one of the best cds now evanescence give you someone to realate to with amy lees perfect voice and ben moodys sick guitar that makes an original sound.
B0000931QR|5.0|Forget your normal Spanish bands and singers- this is how Spanish music should be. Without the normal trumpets and re-used salsa, bolero etc..sounds, La Oreja De Van Gogh have managed to pull off one of the best albums of all time under the imaginative title of \\"What I told you whilst you were fake sleeping\\".<BR> Amaia (the lead vocalist) is one of the most talented singers in the world today. Her voice ranges from being delicate and beautiful to loud and even occasionally aggresive.<BR> As for the songs?? They are kind of mid tempo and light rock style. There's so much you could say about this album- it's uplifting, catchy, simple, suitable for people who like virtually any type of music and it doesn't fit in to the stereotypes. <BR> Songs that I recommend are \\"20 De Enero\\", \\"Deseos de cosas imposibles\\", \\"Un Mundo Mejor\\" and the stunning \\"Perdonme\\", but all the tracks are excellent. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the better books I have read in many a year. It is a mystery thriller, a fascinating detective story, and is based upon history. All women will be delighted with the ending.
B000022TSW|4.0|This movie was hysterical I love it.  The only reason I gave it four stars was that their were a few to many musical songs in it.  Some songs were amusing while others [were bad].  The best part is you see kenny without his hood! All South Park fans should see this.  Also if you like Matt Stone and Trey Parker you should buy the season dvds, and baseketballs.  Buy this movie!!!!!
0780622553|4.0|What is first evident upon watching &quot;Dark City&quot; is that it is one of the coolest looking films ever concieved, a monumental achievement in production design.  The film blends science fiction and film noir so seamlessly that they become one and the same, a new category unto itself.  In my opinion, the film is worth watching based on its visual merits alone.  However, perhaps a bit overshadowed by the look of the film, &quot;Dark City&quot; also boasts a very engaging story that mixes elements of sci-fi, mystery, horror, romance and psychological thriller effectively.  In fact, many have argued that the basic premise behind this film was 'borrowed' by &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and although I prefer not to get in to that discussion, I will say that the case can certainly be made for such an accusation.<br />When the elements of &quot;Dark City&quot; are viewed as a whole the end result is a very good film that succeeds in exploring such issues as free will, perception vs. reality, and the human spirit.  Some may argue that the characters are flat and undeveloped, but when seen in the context of the story it becomes evident that certain characters who fit this description are presented in this fashion for a reason.<br />&quot;Dark City&quot; is not without its flaws, the chief among them being the overuse of convenient coincidence and a certain over the top sense of melodrama.  The film also loses a bit of steam towards its conclusion, suffering from a common case of overambitiousness.  However, all in all &quot;Dark City&quot; is a film that is well worth watching and deserving of the 'cult classic' status it has begun to achieve despite its underwhelming performance at the box office.
B0000584V3|5.0|It seems redundant to even praise Opeth in these reviews. Anyone that has taken a chance on this band knows by now that they are simply incredible, and Blackwater Park is no exception. While not as universally loved among Opeth fans, I think that this album ranks only behind Damnation as their best work. While much harder than the newest disk, Blackwater Park still drips with spine-tingling arrangments, Death Vox that rank with the best in the genre, and magnum opus 10 minute songs that have to be heard to be believed. It is true that it takes a special type person to actually &quot;get&quot; what Opeth is all about, but this listener can think of no better place to start than Blackwater Park. Heavy, soft, epic, and incredibly deep, this describes Opeth.<br />Standout Tracks:<br />Bleak<br />Harvest<br />The Leper Affinity<br />Blackwater Park<br />The Drapery Falls<br />The Funeral Portrait
B00003CX5P|4.0|First of all one has to know two things before watching this movie. First thing is that there is no way this movie will be able to live up to the expectations when compared to other Star Wars movies, second, one has to understand that Star Wars movies are for kids. You were a kid when you watched the first one, so there is no way that you can recapture that essence of youth now with this movie. Going back and watching the first one (episode four) this one is not that bad, its actullay pretty good. The fight scenes are great, the graphics and special effects are better than anything else at the time, only episode II has better. And the sound effects are great, even the music score is great, not great like the Imperial March. Its very interesting to see how everything came about, the movie is a little dark, in the episodes 4-6, the good guys win, this one there are little defeats. The character devolopment of Obi Wan is more interesting to see than that of the Kid, they do that in episode II. The political nature of the film is a bit dry and boring, but its needed to get to the point. Bottom line, its a good film, I have it on DVD, because its a really nice DVD to own. It makes full use of the DVD technology.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This movie is seems normal throughout the beginning scenes. But since the director is David Lynch I knew it would not be for long. Naomi Watts plays Betty a sweet girl from Canada. When she finds Rita played by Laura Elena Harring. They try to find out who Rita really is. A lot of other stuff happens im not going to give anything away. I will tell you this if you understand the ending you are a genius!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is one DVD you can't miss if you liked the movies. Don't expet movie quality in this. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS! I can't belive you people, You critisize this for being ugly or having no plot. DUH! It's not suppost to have plot. What it is are the Ideas the Wachowski brothers had that didn't fit into the movies in any way. They wanted to publish the cool ideas simply because they are cool! Allright, here's the episode by episode break down:<br />Final Flight of the Osiris - <BR> This is photo realisticly computer animated. It is basicly a prequal to the game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. At the end of FFOTO, a crew member drops of a message in a mailbox in the matrix, and the game starts with retriving that message from the post office, and after that first part, &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; parallels the Movie, &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;.<br />The Second Renaissance - <BR> Done in realistic drawn animation, this explanes the history of the world before the matrix up to the creation of the Matrix.<br />Kid's Story - <BR> Done in &quot;paint-style&quot; animation. Kid is that anoying kid from that begining of Matrix Reloaded, who keeps thanking neo for saving him. Well this shows what happens and how Kid escapes from the matrix.<br />WARNING - PAST THIS POINT THE SHORTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIES!<br />Program - <BR> Done in Japanise style animation, this is a fight between to people in a medival training program, in which one of the W... brother's ideas comes out. I'll give you a clue (Syfer Training).<br />World Record - <BR> Done in a plain funky animation style that makes agents look like elvis... Basicly a track runner runs so hard his legs explode, but he keeps running anyway through sear will, and wakes up from the matrix for a moment...<br />Beyond - <BR> Done in the same style as Second Renaissance, this is a nicely done piece about just your average matrix inhabitants who find an old building that the local kids call a &quot;Haunted House&quot;. When really it's just a glitchy place in the Matrix. Very Iteresting.<br />A Detective Story - <BR> Done in Black and White animation, this is a short story about a detective (among others) that was hired by an agent to find a mysterous Hacker by the name of Trinity...<br />Matriculated - <BR> Done in the same style as TSR, this is the most disturbing piece, about turning the machines in a virtual world to get them to swich sides willingly. &quot;To a machine, all reality is vurtual&quot;... well that dosn't apply to humans, as when the machine trys to help this person, it plugs them back into the dream-world, but to catisrophic effect...<br /> Don't forget that there's also a bunch of speacial features incuding a trailer for &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.
B000002TQV|5.0|Once in a while, an album is released that leaves an unforgettable impression on the listener. Not just the first time, but EVERY time. \\"The Bends\\" is one of those albums. Each song reveals yet another layer of complexity each time it is listened to. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Bulletproof\\" are incredible examples of songwriting (learn well, pop performers and rock star wannabes). How the hell did you come with this stuff, Thom???<br />Excellent albums get 4 stars, but a stellar album--one that you actually can't wait to put into your CD player again--merits all the stars it can get.
6305205620|5.0|I am normally very critical of many of the heavy metal dvds out today. Mainly because of editing and cinematography. This one is a keeper! I would use stronger words, but the Amazon censor police would substitute them with kindergarten words [ ]. I loved the 360 degree stage in the middle of the arena and the \\"was that real?\\" theatrics at the end of Enter Sandman. The set list was great. If you are a true metal fan you've got to get this one. It's a little pricey, but worth it.
0140120416|5.0|I used this book in the second term of an accelarated version of First Year Russian at the University level.  Brown's introduction to the language is really incredible.  <br />Unlike many more expensive and flashier products, Brown covers ALL the main grammatical topics in the Russian language with a minimum of jargon.  Other books either gloss over or over-complicate concepts like verbal aspect or participles -- discouraging students from continuing their study of the language.<br />At the same time, the shopper should be ware that this is not a phrasebook, or business travel course.  It is oriented around teaching the reader Russian at a first year University level (or British A-level, as Brown himself notes).  While I have no doubt that this text can be used on its own without tapes (Russian is, after all a phonetic langauge) or perhaps even an instructor, to self-study with this book, the student must be absolutely serious and disciplined.  The book has a number of exercises and examples, which are very helpful.<br />The maximum benefit will be realized from this book by the reader who already has a good understanding of the Cyrillic script (not a very difficult one), and who will use Brown's book as the main text in a program supplemented by other vocabulary-building and grammar-practice texts, and preferrably an instructor.<br />After four years of serious study, I am now fluent in Russian thanks to the foundation that Brown's book provided.  If you are serious about the language, and have the discipline to seriously study Russian through an instructional text, Brown's Russian Course is the book for you.
B00008R9LZ|5.0|MIB is an excellent film.  I bought this DVD to test the Superbit picture.  Honestly, I could not see a significant difference.  I watched it on a normal TV with a progressive scan DVD player and could not tell it was higher resolution.
B00006V9A0|4.0|I guess that since I already own every Nirvana album there is, there is no necesity for this one (I even have &quot;You know you are right&quot;). But here is the product review of it anyways:<br />It has all the hits from all the albums except from &quot;Wiskah.&quot; Starting from &quot;About a Girl&quot; from Bleach, to 2 versions of the &quot;Unpluged.&quot;<br />Emotions range from anger and strengh that are given characters on Nirvana's music, to slow and beautifull acustic songs.<br />The new song &quot;You know you are right&quot; leaves you thinking about how promising could Nirvana have been if it wasn't for Cobain's suicide. <br />Taken, it's a great song, and while you are thinking about how would another Nirvana album would have been, &quot;About a Girl&quot; start the set of hits.<br />Never boring, no need for skipping songs. Not necesary if you have all Nirvana albums and you downloaded &quot;You know you are right&quot;.<br />Highlights: &quot;You know You are Right&quot;
B00005JKHN|5.0|Following in the traditional style of Walt's masterpieces Snow White and Cinderella, this Disney classic is true to the Charles Perraut version of the French fairy tale. Over six years in the making and entailing a budget of over 6 million dollars, 'The Sleeping Beauty' became one of the top-grossing movies of 1959, second only to Ben Hur.<BR>  <br />Sleeping Beauty was the first animated motion picture to be filmed in the 75 mm widescreen format, unlike its predecessors Cinderella, Pinocchio and Snow White. The animation, which is extremely luscious and poignant, is also portrayed in finer details. The Renaissance influenced backgrounds and castles and the vibrant splendor of the forests are a beauty to be marveled at. Equally outstanding is the brilliant adaptation of the Peter Tchaikovsky score, which is richly melodious and simply surrounds you throughout the movie. The Oscar nominated score truly adds to the visual stunningness of Sleeping Beauty. <BR> <br />The characters are wonderfully created with an in-depth look into each of their respective personalities. Princess Aurora is the deity of beauty and feminine coyness embedded in a romantic heart. Prince Phillip is handsome, brave, noble and passionate and possesses every virtue of an ideal hero. Maleficent is a unique villain, her cruelty and wickedness sometimes a little too scary for younger viewers. The three good fairies; Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, are each created with remarkable liveliness. Flora is the self-appointed leader of the trio; Fauna of a soft-hearted, peace-loving nature; and Merryweather her impatient, practical-minded self. King Stefan and Hubert and the prince's horse, Samson add a lot of humor to the tale.<BR> <br />The vocal talents comprise of Mary Costa as Aurora, whose solo classical numbers are a pleasure to hear. Eleanor Audley, who had brought to life Cinderella's cruel stepmother with stunning chillness, was asked by Walt Disney himself to portray the role of Maleficent. Bill Shirley is excellent as the speaking and singing voice of Phillip and Verna Felton voices Flora with warmth and spasm.<BR> <br />Overall, a visual and musical masterpiece which is coming to a 2 Disc special edition DVD on September 7, 2003 in the US; and has already been released in a 2 Disc collector's set in Europe the April of this year. I own the European one, and must say that 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is breath-taking. The European Disc also provides a fascinating DTS track; which although not available for the US release, is compensated there by an additional 1.33:1 fullscreen presentation of the movie and a few trailers (but take it from me, the visual beauty of this movie can only be appreciated in the widescreen format). The bonus features on Disc two offer an in-depth look at the film itself and how it was made. Also included are vast virtual galleries, a set-top game, some live-action references and lots of other interesting aspects. So enjoy this classic masterpiece from Disney in all its glory. I simply adore this movie and shall always cherish it with me.
B00004T8RK|1.0|Pearl Jam is a great and very talented band. The single &quot;Nothing As it Seems&quot; made me buy this album. The sad part is that this is the most &quot;unispired&quot; album that this band has gave us so far.<br />There is nothing like &quot;Ten&quot; or &quot;Vs&quot; in here. It's mostly slow clean songs with a little heavy or grungy parts. The melodies are very weak and Eddie's voice leaves a lot to wish for.<br />The heavy songs, like the opener, are actually not the Pearl Jam that I love. It's not aggresive an just plainly not good. I would also say that the album is even overproduced.<br />Makes me wish that their next album will be more &quot;Pearl Jam Like&quot;
B000002UC5|5.0|Like John Lennon's solo debut,&quot;McCartney&quot; is a simple,<BR>homespun,decidedly anti-production effort that puts Paul's<BR>current predilection for over-production and schmaltz to shame!<BR>This is packed with fun little ditties like &quot;That Lovely Linda&quot;,<BR>&quot;Every Night&quot;,Man We Was Lonely&quot; and the Beatle outtake &quot;Teddy<BR>Boy&quot;.Bluesier little rock 'n roll numbers such as &quot;Ooh You&quot; and<BR>&quot;That Would Be Something&quot; have alot of charm while the grand,<BR>piano-based classic &quot;Mabye I'm Amazed&quot; makes it's first (and I'd<BR>say best) appearance here.It's a true classic the deverses it's good reputation and support-an honest effort for McCartney!
B000002UAR|5.0|If you are one of those who insist one saying that REVOLVER was only a stepping stone to such \\"masterpieces\\" as SGT. PEPPER, then you obviously haven't been paying any attention.  This album is a self-contained plethora of everythng that was right about the FAB 4; from the opening tirade of \\"Taxman\\" to the closing cacopohony of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", this lil' album covers it all. I mean. I MEAN. take a listen folks: You got John giving us his psychadelic version of the universe, Paul blessing us with his angelic melodies, Ringo doing the thing that only Ringo can do, AND BY FAR the best George Harrison songs recorded by the group.  \\"I Want To Tell You\\" is simply sublime (look it up).  Anyone that can listen to \\"and Your Bird Can Sing\\" without being moved is either comatose or, to put it bluntly, musically retarded.  SGT. PEPPER was a landmark achievement but, it was more of an event than an actual album.  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was simply a current greatest hits package.  The only albums in the Beatle canon that can even claim to come close to this album are THE BEATLES & ABBEY ROAD.  Musically, the moptops never surpassed these sessions from the spring of '66.  True, they equalled it on occasion (e.g. \\"Hey Jude\\", side 2 of ABBEY ROAD). but, in the the words of both John Lennon & George Martin (this is not verbatim) ,\\"We never topped REVOLVER.\\"----'nuff said
B00005JLD4|5.0|Wow. This is a film best seen with as little knowledge about it as possible.<BR>Which defeats the purpose of actually reading these reviews, huh?<BR>Anyways, you will find it hard to believe the atrocities inflicted upon the Aboriginal population in Australia, in our not-so-distant past. It's shocking. The events are so fantastic that they stretch the limit of believability, until the last shots of the film. In our living room, a hushed silence followed the final images as the credits rolled.<BR>The young actors are marvelous...the eldest daughter has a fresh, very real presence and at times, this unshakable haunted gaze. She's transfixing.<BR>Kenneth Branagh, despite the marketing, has a small role, competently done. You need to know this movie is all about the kids and their struggle against the Australian establishment.<BR>Believe the word-of-mouth. See this film. You will feel like writing something yourself...
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is Kevin Smith's first flim and it is my favorite out of all of them. It was made on a very low budget with no experienced actors and was shot in black and white. There is hardly a plot, but its about two \\"clerks\\" dante and randall who hate their jobs and the people that come into their stores. That is basically the plot. It works well cause there all inexperienced actors, and it is just a funny funny movie. Recommended to anyone.
B00009MECF|4.0|This movie is a tale of young man's struggle through his teen years.  In the beginning, he has it all, but then starts using drugs for a thrill.  When his habit becomes and addiction, this movie takes you on a ride that brings the dark side of drugs to life.  DiCaprio's work in this movie is sheer genius.. A must see!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The strokes by far are the best band walking the earth right now.  People write that they have a repetitive sound, and the singing voice is horrible, and blah blah blah.  Maybe so, but whatever you think it doesnt matter, because you are either going to be a strokes fan, or you are not.  There is no in between.  But I can say that those who are strokes fans (like myself) probably recognize the sheer amazingness thats inside this band, and all of there (not one bad) amazing songs.  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see this, and god take pity on them.
B000002KON|5.0|This is a really good album. I think everyone should buy this album, becouse of the good songs like : Arthur, Australia , Yes sir No sir.. ect.
B00007GZRA|5.0|When last we left our heroes SG-1 was on a Goa'uld warship heading for Earth and with that rather dramatic cliffhanger we begin Season 2 of &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot;  Adding insult to injury, the ship is commanded by Klorel, the &quot;son&quot; of Apophis, who possesses the body of Skaara (Alexis Cruz).  By the end of the DVD it is clear that the series that had the best first season in the history of science fiction television is going to be even better:<br />Episode 1, &quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot; (Written by Brad Wright, Aired June 26, 1998) the SG-1 team is now on a suicide mission having planted explosives on the warship.  Unfortunately, there is more than one Goa'uld ship on its way to Earth.  Then they are captured by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's Jaffa mentor who also wants to free his people from the control of Apophis (Peter Williams).  Bra'tac has a plan to stop both warships but the SG-1 crew will still end up just as dead and Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) still wants to free Skaara from Klorel's control. Meanwhile, back at Cheyenne Mountain there is a frantic effort to save part of American culture by sending people through the Stargate to an Alpha Site.  General Hammond (Don S. Davis) is also preparing to defend the base as long as possible and is finding lots of subtle ways of telling Lt. Colonel Samuels (Robert Wisden), &quot;I told you so, you arrogant jerk.&quot;  Just because we have ever reason to believe the Earth is not going to be conquered at the end of the episode does not take away from the fun.  4.5 Stargates.<br /><br />Episode 2, &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot; (Written by Robert C. Cooper, Aired July 3, 1998) introduces a major new element into the series.  SG-1 is sent to Nasya to rescue survivors of a Goa'uld attack.  When she resuscitates a wounded man Dr. Carter (Amanda Tapping) is taken over by a Goa'uld and the only one who notices when SG-1 gets back home in young Cassandra (Katie Stuart).  Eventually O'Neill catches on and we learn that the Goa'uld in Carter is Jolinar of Malkshur, a leader of the Tok-ra Goa'ulds, a group in rebellion against the system lords.  The threat, he tells them, comes not from himself but from an assassin who will kill him by killing Carter.  Clearly in this second season there is an emphasis on expanding the show's roster of good Goa'ulds.  An above average episode involving paranoia at Stargate Command with long-range implications for the season and the series.  4.5 Stargates.<br />Episode 3, &quot;Prisoners&quot; (Written by Terry Curtis Fox, Aired July 10, 1998) are exploring a planet when a frantic fleeing man begs to be saved from his pursuers.  However, the man turns out to be a murderer fleeing justice and by helping him the SG-1 team is judged guilty of the same crime and receives the same punishment: life imprisonment on the prison world Hadante.  Oddly enough, the person who appears to be in charge in this brutal environment is Linea (Bonnie Barlett), an old woman who actually strikes fear into the hearts of the prisoners.  Linea is a scientist and if she can power the Stargate with a cold fusion power source, then SG-1 will help her escape with them.  This certainly sounds like a good deal, especially since General Hammond is making little progress in negotiating the team's release from their captors.  However, things just do not add up and the question is whether SG-1 can rework the math in time.  Hopefully down the road there will be a sequel to &quot;Prisoners,&quot; but even if there is not it will remain a classic episode with a great payoff at the end.  5 Stargates.<br />Episode 4 &quot;The Gamekeeper&quot; (Written by Jonathan Glassner &amp; Brad Wright, Teleplay by Glassner, Aired July 17, 1998) offers the comic relief on this volume with guest star Dwight Schultz who plays the Keeper.  The SG-1 team travels to P7J989 where they find a beautiful garden and a dome containing metallic chambers housing unconscious humanoids.  While inspecting some empty chambers the team is ensnared.  The next thing we know O'Neil and Teal'c are reliving a mission Jack had in his younger days where he lost a man.  One of the members of his team was Captain Kawalsky (Jay Acovone).  Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson and Captain Carter relive the accident that killed his parents.  As soon as each scenario ends it restarts as if nothing had happened.  Both O'Neil and Jackson try to change &quot;history,&quot; but nothing works and eventually they both decided they do not want to play this sick game anymore.  That is when the Keeper (Schultz) shows up and explains they are being given a chance to make things right.  But the more the Keeper explains the situation and the rules, the more it becomes clear he is hiding something.  I can only imagine how many times they had to reshoot scenes because the cast was breaking up at Schultz's vocal affectation.  Even the most innocent lines become a real hoot with that voice he created for this character.  There is a slight hole in the episode in terms of the inability of O'Neill and Jackson to save these lives (O'Neill's soldiers apparently do not know how to do a standard reconnaissance of a building they want to attack), but Schultz's performance redeems such problems.  4.5 Stargates.<br />One classic episode and three above average adventures is pretty good for a single volume of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episodes, but if you have been working your way diligently through the first season and beyond then you should be completely hooked on this intelligently crafted science fiction series.  I am most impressed by the effort to work in new elements right from the start of Season 2 to set up some important moments down the road.  You also have a pair of excellent guest stars in Barlett and Schultz.ecting some empty chambers the team is ensnared.

B00006CXXU|5.0|this cd is tuly a work of art. after all shes been through she has the strength to move on.people have called her names and yet she can still come out w/ a great cd. most people dont give it a chance becuase of the cover. well i hate to let all u haters down but its not about being naked its about showing her true self. most people base fiendships on what kind of clothes they wear and how pretty they are. she called the album stripped becuase she wants peple to see past her clothes and into her body. this cd has great songs mostly about her life believe it or not. fighter is about all she went through but still havin the strength to move on. beutiful is about not lettin other people bring her down but to believe in herself. there are alot of songs that will encourage u to believe in ur self. if u dont buy this cd and dont give it a chance then u will regret it.u can count on my words there true. and if u dont believe me. believe in the old christina aguilera she hasnt changed on the inside she still christina aguilera and always will be. u wont regret just listening to this cd
B000003S0B|5.0|Well, if nothing else this second Crimson album proves that if something works, fixing it until it breaks is a worthy end. The first half of POSEIDON is a somewhat less apocolyptic reiteration of IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING's first half, and it's probably only a matter of which you hear first as to which you will prefer. Me, I prefer COURT if for no other reason than up to its release in 1969 there simply was nothing like it, anywhere, ever (including Barry Godber's stunning cover), so that by the time POSEIDON appeared a year later its effect was mitigated by the first LP's already being there. The second half of POSEIDON, however, is a different story altogether. The extended coda to 'Moonchild' nothwithstanding, there was little humor to be found in COURT. POSEIDON's second half, though, is a veritable laff riot. Keith Tippett's tinkly piano solos on 'Cat Food' (echoed three years later in Mick Garson's beautiful solo on Bowie's 'Alladin Sane') are even more hilarious than my cat and virtually define the already-amusing song. And the lengthy, bass-heavy, Mellotron-laden 'The Devil's Triangle', though beginning coyly enough, gets so heated up as it plods maniacally along that a chorus of 'In The Court Of The Crimson King' manages to sneak in a ghoulish and gleeful appearance toward the bubbly conclusion. A nagging question, though: How come Fripp decided not to include 'Groon', the B-side to the original single release of 'Cat Food', on this reissue? It was pretty funny too, you know.
B000053VAF|5.0|All you people are really stoopid f*cks... can't you just enjoy the film for what it is?  Stop reading between the lines and talking about the film being blasphemous.  If you dont find it funny, then fine, maybe you just have &quot;sophisticated&quot; tastes but i dont give a f*ck, jay and silent bob was the best comedic duo ever created by the genius kevin smith
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Few movies that I know have dived into the darkness of drug addiction like Requiem for a Dream.<BR>Regardless of Ellen Burstyn greatness (which should have given her an Oscar), the drama is so intense that makes you forget who the actors are.<BR>The tragic descend into hell is relentless, mercyless and extremelly realistic. I believe this movie should be exhibited in high schools in order to curb kids from drugs. Or even be a mandatory item in drug rehabilitation programs, much like Clockwork Orange was for violent minds.<BR>I warn you: you got to have guts to see this movie. It's not horror, no fun, but profound and cientific work.<BR>Congratulations to all who made and/or particiated into this masterpiece!
0385504209|5.0|The book had me hooked after only a few pages.  Dan Brown has a way of giving you just enought information to keep you wildly interested without giving away the plot.  Most books are very perdictable, but not this one.  The revelations kept coming up to the last page.
B0000399WI|4.0|A thoroughly entertaining movie. I don't normally enjoy screen adaptions of Stephen King movies. With the exception of Misery and Dolores Claiborne. But this one is well worth the nearly 3 hours it takes to watch it.<br />Sometimes the acting is too &quot;staged&quot; and the dialogue too &quot;scripted&quot; but nontheless a great experience.<br />Even though it is supposed to have a happy ending it left me feeling sad. Kudos to Tim Robbins for a great acting job.<br />Worth buying, and you can expect an emotional rollercoaster as you watch it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta has been a band I've been looking forward to for some time - not solely because of their ties to At The Drive-In, but for the fact that they (while Sparta went the pure-emo route) are mixing things up musically.  This CD is a psychadelic mix of everything from emocore freak-outs to bass-lead jam sessions to ambient bridges.  The suggestive, hallucinatory lyrics mesh perfectly with the soundbed they are laid down upon - and the commanding vocals are wonderful.  This CD is certainly more ambitious than anything ATDI ever attempted, and leagues ahead of \\"Wiretap Scars\\".<br />Unlike 99% of music today this is not an album of singles, but a conceptual piece of art that flows together from start to end - the first song (basically an intro to the second) is minimalist electronica with stabs of distorted guitar which pumps directly into the volatile chorus (Cedric yelling \\"Now, I'm lost!\\") of the first true song, \\"Inertiatic ESP\\".  This track, in turn, flows directly into the third song \\"Roulette Dares\\" and so on.  The album works best as a whole - like a heavy, fast version of pink floyd - with peaks and valleys galore.  Yes, there is a hint of emo in this - but this band defies any such classification, including the brand \\"progressive emo\\".<br />Unlike most progressive music The Mars Volta is interested in not perfecting and tweaking the normal structure of music but completely destroying it.  Songs go from heavy to virtually silent, there are non-melodic guitar squeals to match the quite visual lyrics and layers and layers of music swathed over nearly ever second of this album; it is not a CD you put on and just jam to - it demands attention.  When given attention, like any album with such complexity (Radiohead, Tool, Pink Floyd), it works extremely well and is quite rewarding.  There are, though, things that do not work.<br />For instance - it is completely unessecarry to put so much ambient noise in the middle of songs.  Sometimes it works (Roulette Dares) but sometimes it just interrupts the flow of the song.  Point in case, the 12 minute long \\"Cicatriz ESP\\"; while perhaps the most rousing song on the album the 3+ minutes of synth noodling (in the middle of the song!) are completely uneeded and seem to detract from the impact of the piece itself (which is why I fast-forward past it everytime).  These overdone bits of ambience pop up a handful of times on the album and, while not ruining any songs, do break up the flow of many.<br />This is just a minor quibble though.  All in all, \\"De-Loused\\" is one of my favorite albums this year.  It takes more chances than a band has in recent memory and I find myself more moved by it than even Radiohead's new effort.  It leads me to wondering though; if the 10+ minutes of uneeded near-silent bridges had been done away with and replaced with another song it could have concievably been an almost pitch-perfect instant classic.<br />On the other hand, as it is, this album is still a classic (just not perfect), but buyer beware; this is not At The Drive-In or Sparta.  This isn't even like anything to come before it.  This is a step-forward that I'm sure will not gel to all musical tastes.  This is not a single album (though Inertiatic ESP would work as one).  This is The Mars Volta.<br />And it's one of the best things I've heard in a long time.
0333961072|4.0|This is a simple book based on items in the bedroom as a bunny goes to bed at night. It is a classic, never-ending tale of a bunny fighting to go to bed at night. So he tries to prolong the inevitable by naming everything in his room and saying good night to it. It's a cute book ~~ very simple for beginners to try and perhaps to introduce a young reader to the joys of reading. <br />I enjoy reading it to my sons ~~ it's a classic.<br />7-31-03

B00009V93Z|2.0|There were signs of trouble last year when BMG released the &quot;companion&quot; box set to -Elvis: Close Up-, -Elvis: Today, Tomorrow, &amp; Forever-.  While not a bad compilation by any means, it really didn't come across as revelatory or overly-necessary.  This latest release, however, is a blatant slap in the face to fans of the King.<br />Disc One is hyped as containing unreleased stereo masters from the 50s.  In reality, the tracks are primitive binaural mixes of songs from his first gospel album and the movies &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;Loving You&quot;.  In addition, these are not and were never intended to be master recordings.  They were backups recorded on a two-track machines.  Most egregious is the inclusion of 3 versions of &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot;, 2 versions of &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot;, 2 versions of &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot;, 2 versions of &quot;Loving You&quot;, and 2 versions of &quot;Don't Leave Me Now&quot; (none of which were exactly standouts in Elvis' recording career).  In all, disc one boasts only 14 actual songs.<br />Disc Two &quot;treats&quot; the listener to 25 alternate versions of songs from Elvis' first 4 post-army films.  While not really bad, there is nothing here that's particularly memorable.  One should check out the 2-CD -Command Performances- for better renditions of his 60's movie songs.<br />Disc Three, the strongest of the four, contains highlights from Elvis' Nashville sessions of 1960-1967.  Unfortunately, the best outtakes from this era are available elsewhere (Disc 5 of the stunning -From Nashville to Memphis: The Essential 60s Masters I- box set and the criminally out-of-print -Such a Night: The Essential Elvis, Vol. 6-).  Highlights include the bouncy &quot;Make Me Know It&quot; as well as &quot;Marie's the Name&quot; and the pre-comeback &quot;U.S. Male&quot;<br />Disc 4 consists of a complete 1972 performance from San Antonio, Texas, excerpts of which were included in the film &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot;.  Unfortunately, this was not a particularly good night for Elvis.  He sounds tired, distracted, and not a little bored.  Much better examples of Elvis live in '72 can be found on the exciting -An Afternoon at the Garden- and the -Burning Love- compilation.  There is one stunning exception, however.  Towards the end of the show, Elvis launches into a rough-and-tumble version of &quot;Burnin' Love&quot;, which at the time of this concert had yet to be released.  Other than that, there's nothing remotely memorable here.<br />On the plus side, the entire box boasts crystal clear sound and well-written, thorough liner notes.  That is not enough, however, to hide the fact that, with this release, BMG has begun a slide into a level of blatant Elvis exploitation not seen since the late '70s.  Pass this one up.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all times!  From the first moment I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down...it took command of me immediately and didn't let go even after reading the last page.  Alice Sebold is an incredible author.  I bought this book because I thought the plot sounded absolutely preposterous.  I'm glad my curiosity got the better of me!  This tale is poignant, insightful, beyond emotional.  If you read any book this year, this should be the one!
B00005JM1Y|5.0|007 & Austin Danger Powers watch out Johnny English has arived! This movie is fun for the whole family. This movie will make you laugh even if your French (there are some realy good French jokes in this movie). This movie made me laugh so much I started to cry. Good story good content one of the best movies I have seen all year. The whole spy thing needed a new face and Mike Myers isn't cutting it any more, at least not for me he isn't. Please get off your ass and go see this movie (or I will send a Frenchman to your house to insult you and generally stink up the place).  <br />(Sorry about the French thing it's an English/American  thing & only a joke)
B000051VWW|5.0|The British quartet set out in 1985 with Diamond Life and never looked back. The latest installment in the series is Lovers Rock, amidst rumors that Sade was broken up and had been laid to rest in \\"Where Are They Now?\\" history. This album proves that Sade indeed has staying power, and probably is their best to date.<br />Lovers' rock is actually a sweet, slow reggae, which Sade has got down to a T here. Admittedly, most of the songs here sound quite similar (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10) in the relaxed drum machine, but it is totally forgiveable when you hear Sade murmuring how she'll stay \\"By Your Side\\", where a love light rushes over her in \\"Flow\\", and how she's crying everyone's tears in \\"King Of Sorrow\\". The writer's opinion is that \\"Every Word\\" would have made an excellent single, but no matter. That's also forgivable when you hear it performed live (see the Lovers Live dvd), along with every other song on the CD, except All About Our Love, which is a shame because it's an addictive song.<br />All in all, Sade is like fine wine: they just get better with age. Let's hope for more music in the years to come.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|First of all, I must admit, the movie was funny, there were some good lines and it was after all quite entertaining. But I just cannot see what all the hype is about, I think \\"Shrek\\" is overrated and despite being funny at times, it is an ordinary fairy tale with no surprises. The positive aspects are of course that this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well by children. Although some references made in the movie are too difficult to understand for children, they are well understood by adults and some of them are absolutely hilarious. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. Most of the songs have been well chosen to blend into the scenes and make \\"Shrek\\" even more fun to watch. <BR>The negative aspects are however that the movie has been overrated. There are far better movies out there, even if you just look in this genre, you are bound to find better movies that have a more complex and less predictable plot. To sum up, I think the movie is entertaining to watch but I wouldn't waste my money on buying the DVD.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is the first Madonna CD I've ever bought, and I'm so pleased. From beginning to end, this is a CD full of what I call \\"smart\\" techno. It's not the stupid techno that sounds all the same and has no lyrics. It's good stuff. <br />As we all know, this album marked the beginning of Madonna's spiritual/introspective period. I think it's a good thing. I think Madonna shines on this album. As a relatively new fan of Madonna's album, I can't compare this to her earlier albums, but I'm quite sure this will remain one of my favorites.<br />It's difficult to have a favorite track on this album, but Skin and To Have And Not To Hold would have to be the ones. Madonna says she set out to rock the dance floor with Skin, noting the way it starts out quietly, then ends in a frenzy. Another song to note would be Little Star, Madonna's song for her daughter Lourdes. It's sweet. <br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this CD to Madonna fans and techno/house fans. It definitely has some of the best music I've ever heard from her.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The construction of the trans-continental railroad steaming forward at the tip of a bullit.  I remember reading somewhere that Clint Eastwood wanted his film \\"Unforgiven\\" to include everything he liked about westerns.  He must have used \\"Once Upon A Time\\" as a map (no offense to Clint as \\"Unforgiven\\" is my second favorite western.)  Ironically, I think it was Eastwood who was to play the Bronson part, but for reasons i'm unaware of was unable to.  This film has everything.  Outstanding in every way, and Henry Fonda cast against type is the icing on the cake.  Simply spectacular.  If you don't realize this movie is a pure masterpiece before the final showdown, you will after.  If you've never seen it do yourself a favor and watch!  You won't regret it.  I loved this movie the first time I saw it and each subsequent viewing brings new appreciation for the depth of its story and symbolism.  Pure cinematic pleasure.
6303589162|5.0|Body Double, along with Blow Out, is my favorite Brian De Palma movie. I have watched it at least 20 times and whenever I get the chance I show it to friends and co-workers too. I cannot explain in a coherent or intelligent way why I love this film so much but the story, De Palma's staging of murder & suspense scenes (esp. when Craig Wesson is chasing the mysterious femme fatale through the beach and gets an anxiety attack in a tunnel...the scene is one of the best De Palma ever did and we get the feeling Hitchcock would've been proud). I love all of De Palma's Hitch rip-offs, and this is no exception. Although De Palma doesn't really \\"rip-off\\" so much as take techniques and camera movements/effects Hitch perfected and use them for his own suspense/thriller films. I like all of De Palma's movies...yes, even Bonfire of the Vanties, Snake Eyes, Mission Impossible, & Mission to Mars; all critical bombs (except for MI obviously); but Body Double is my fav. If you like De Palma or even just good ole' truly scary and thrilling suspense films.
6305428557|4.0|I'm late discovering this movie and I wouldn't know Hugh Grant from Ulysses S., but it was a lovely way to spend an evening.  Subtle humor, various characters including one traumatized by the war (WWI) and those that develop over time, and a nice collection of scenes to look at made it really worthwhile.  In our over-hyped, rushed scenes, odd camera angles, and star-worshipping, it's nice to have a quiet little film to just relax with.
0671034065|5.0|This book is unlike any other book penned by Linda Howard. It is funny and witty, and it will keep you hollering with laughter.<BR>Jane, our heroine, is feisty and clever, and not shy to express her feelings, even though she is honestly trying to quit cussing (without much luck, I must say). <br />The chemistry between Jane and her &quot;rotten neigbor&quot; is sizzling hot. The psycho killer that's on the lose will keep you guessing to the last page. An even though you might have some suspicions, you'll never guess how twisted the story really is.<br />This book is such a good read that I reach for it whenever my mood is down. Its light humor can lift anyone's spirit and knowing &quot;who dunnit&quot; does not detract from its appeal. BUY IT; it's well worth the expense.
B00005JM02|5.0|I am 16 years old and I enjoyed this movie just as much as any 6 year old, if not more.  Finding Nemo is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time, and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone...all ages can benefit from this movie.  It was exceptionally casted and directed, and will accordingly be one of the best movies of the time.  My favorite part of the movie was Dory, and her quote about \\"escape\\"....you'll have to watch it to see what it was!!!!
B000002V0Q|5.0|What's up with all you reviewers bashing this album for it's difference from their earlier albums?  do you want all megadeth albums sounding the same.  It's not commerciality it's maturity.  what has made megadeth the best metal band of all time is that it fails to sound the same on every album.  This is because of the band's level of musicianship.  The lyrics are better than ever and Mustaine's voice has improved a lot. This is one of Megadeth's best albums.  I love all their albums so I can't say this is the best.  This album might not be at the speed of sound but it definetely has the attitude.  Listen to Symphony of Destruction, Sweating Bullets, Architecture of Aggression.  <br />All the songs on this album are awesome, and it's way better than Metallica's Black Album, trust me, I'm a fan of both bands.  Listen to Megadeth's newer albums too, they're awesome and each different in style. I recommend Youthanasia, Cryptic Writings, Risk, and The World Needs a Hero, and how could I forget Hidden Treasures (album contains 3 grammy nominees)<br />Look for Dave Mustaine in the next year, he'll be back.
B00004WKII|5.0|I suppose your thoughts about this 4 cd set depend on whether or not you're a casual Jimi Hendrix fan or a devout acolyte.  I am numbered among the latter ever since I purchased my first Hendrix lp.  It is interesting to note that the \\"Purple Haze\\" single was released three days after I was born. Jimi's understanding of how to mix rock, blues, soul and improvisation sometimes all during the same song is just one facet of his legacy. He was also able to write memorable songs and his cutting edge use of both feedback and the latest technology and effects is impressive. All of these aspects of his palying are present in this set.<br />The set contains a mix of live material and rare and unissued studio tracks and alternate takes.  The set contains some material which has appeared before on such out of print lps as \\"Rainbow Bridge\\", \\"War Heroes\\", \\"Loose Ends\\", \\"Hendrix In The West\\" and in edited and overdubbed forms on \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Midnight Lightning\\" as well as various bootleg titles.  Alternate takes like \\"Third Stone From The Sun\\" provide a glimpse of both Jimi's sense of humor and love of science fiction.  Rarely played live tracks like \\"Rock Me Baby\\" and \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" from Jimi's historic appearance the Monterey Pop Festival sit alongside gems like \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" from the Berkeley concert in 1970.  The live tracks show that while the Experience may not have been able to duplicate all of the studio overdubs in a concert setting they were still very capable of improvisational and exciting live perfomances.  Underrated Mitch Mitchell was perhaps the best drummer for Hendrix with his Ginger Baker influenced jazzier style of drumming.  Other notable tracks include a studio version of the legendary \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" in which Hendrix makes his guitar sound like a synthesizer.  The much bootlegged tribute to Jimi's Indian ancestry \\"Cherokee Mist\\" is included as well as a stereo version of \\"Highway Chile\\".  A great preconcert rehearsal of \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" is included as well as an impressive unreleased track \\"Country Blues\\" and a raucous cover of \\"Gloria\\" by the original Experience.  A number of funkier tracks Jimi was working on at the time of his death like \\"Come Down Hard On Me\\" appear along with alternate takes of his great singles and early rarities like \\"Taking Care Of No Business\\".  <br />While some of this material has appeared before the remastering by Eddie Kramer is exemplary.  The booklet is pleasing with many unissued pictures and track by track commentary with dates and personnel listings.  Some of the material included has the hated Alan Douglas overdubs removed.  My only regret is that some of the disks do not utilize the full 80 minutes.  However, if you have more than just a passing interest in Jimi Hendrix the differences in alternate takes will be both intersting and the unissued live and studio material both fascinating and enjoyable.  The Hendrix family have finally provided a set worthy of the genius of the best rock guitarist ever Jimi Hendrix!
0440180295|4.0|I had heard this book mentioned many times by many people in literary circles, and thus I bought it to read, just for the experience. It is without a doubt one of the classic anti-war novels, deserving a place right beside Heller's \\"Catch-22\\". It discusses the personal affects of the war on the children that are forced to carry it. Theough Vonnegut's eyes you see that it is not all heroic like the movies would have you believe. And of course it has Vonnegut's classic touch of humor. A fantastic book, everyone should read it at least once. The reason it got four stars is because out of all of Vonnegut's novels, I feel this is one of his worst. But saying worst makes it sound as if its bad. Its not, its fantastic, just not as good as his others.
038572179X|2.0|This was my first McEwan novel, and I have a pretty good feeling it will also be my last.  It is a huge pet peeve of mine to start a book and never finish it, so regardless of how much this book bored me, I trudged along.  I will admit, however, that it took me almost a month to get through the first 150 pages, reading about 3 other books in between.  However, once I finally did get to the end of part 1, the rest was an easy read.  Finally. <br />A friend of mine had told me that she didn't particularly care for McEwan novels because they were so dark.  Dark novels never bothered me.  I usually like the eerie undertones.  Plus, the book had won so many awards, and the majority of the reviews were raving about it. I'm now thinking the world is crazy.  I have no idea why so many people seem to think it is wonderful. <br />After finishing atonement, I was put in a horrible mood.  The whole point of the book, atonement, had not even been achieved.  It left me angry and annoyed.  I suppose being the romantic that I am,  I wouldn't have been so enraged had the book simply ended after part 3.  I still wouldn't have thought it was anything to rave about, but I would have been a little more content and satisfied.  <br />It was part 4 that killed me.  I found it completely unneeded for the plot, and it only made me doubt everything I had just read.  Apparently some people like to question the entire book, but I'm not one of them.  It is the not knowing, and it really made me despise this novel.  It literally put me in a bad mood. Had I known it was supposed to be fiction within fiction perhaps I might have felt different, but not knowing made me hate the outcome, and completely dislike Briony.  I understand it's trying to be realistic, but to throw in certain facts on the last page angered me.  I felt as if McEwan was purposely trying to deceive me in order to see how emotionally attached I could become to these characters, and then throw it in my face that it was all a lie.<br />Needless to say, I did not enjoy this book.  I realize I am using this review as my own private place to vent, but I really just do not understand how it got so many rave reviews.  Despite the fact that I hated Part 4, it took absolutely FOREVER to get into. <br />The book was not only a waste of my time, it put me in a bad mood at all.  Ian McEwan can write well, but unless being depressed is a hobby of yours, I don't recommend this novel at all.
0060931671|4.0|I'd heard that The Crying of Lot 49 was a short and (comparatively) easy introduction to Thomas Pynchon. It certainly is short, but I would still say Pynchon beats most writers at their worst for writing a dense, challenging novel. I'm not going to expound on what the deep significance of this novel is, but rest assured that it'll take all your attention and talent to \\"get it\\" the first time through.<br />However, that is not to say it is a bad novel. The story surrounds Oedipa Maas and the adventure she begins when she is called upon as executrix of the estate of her deceased ex-lover Pierce Invererity. Her quest forces her to confront her beliefs about the workings of society, her own lack of perception in the world around her and ultimately her own sanity. Pynchon writes in a dense, overflowing style where one often has to slow down or reread in order to fully absorb the utter volume of information that is either explicitly or implicitly stated in Pynchon's furious and emotional prose. Character depth is notexistant, but that is evidently Pynchon's plan as they are merely his tools to explore the various issues he raises and are not as vital to the work as his often philosophical pseudo-interpretation of events.<br />If you are into dense, high-intensity literature of the postmodern persuasion, then The Crying of Lot 49 is highly recommended. However, if you are looking to be entertained and don't want to sit around for hours afterward trying to puzzle out the implications of what you have read, Don DeLillo or Jack Kerouac are easier introductions to similar themes.
B000092ZYX|1.0|After hearing \\"There There\\" a few times I gained a liking for it, and decided to give this album a shot.  I've never really listened to Radiohead before, so this probably attributed to my dislike of their style.  I'm not saying this album [is horrible]; I'm just saying it doesn't appeal to what I look for in music.  I personally look for more energetic, loud, dynamic music with the guitars and drums being the driving factors, as well as a vocalist with a powerful voice.  That's just not how Radiohead approaches making music, and no matter how hard I try to enjoy this album I simply can't.  I find this album boring and monotonous.  I guess I'm just not [into it].
0140177396|5.0|I've read quite a few high profile books lately, but it has been years since I have read anything that has affected me at an emotional level as much as Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.  I don't like to go into deeper meaning in my reviews, but I do think that this book is a timeless parable about yearning for a better life and destroying our dreams for fear of losing them.  The book centers on a few days in the life of longtime companions George and Lenny as they look for and find work in order to raise some money.  Their goal is to finally have a place of their own where no one can throw them out.  The narrative is written in Steinbeck's crystal clear style where the story and the caracters are the substance more than the way he uses his words.  Thus, like all his books, Of Mice and Men is a book anyone can pick up and read without feeling in over their head.  Steinbeck does not overcomplicate his work.  He is interested in everyone understanding what he has to say and he does so more clearly than any other major modernist writer of his time.  His characters are found, in part, in anyone.  George and Lenny are well-drawn complex, sympathetic and as complete as they can be for a novel that is only 120 pages (in large type).<br />I rarely say this, but Of Mice and Men is a novel I would recommend to anyone who is interested in a good story.  As is typical of Steinbeck, there is something for everyone.
B00000DFTG|4.0|this cd is good but i still prefer sabbath's other two live recordings live evil and live at last over this one.this album is worth the money for the two studio tracks alone.physcho man and selling my soul are great songs.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is in my opinion the best Beatles album and the best album of all time.  It includes three of my top ten favorite songs of all time.

B00000APLB|4.0|Almost all of the Stones' numerous live albums are worth a listen, and \\"Love You Live\\" is, too.  It features several classics and some well-chosen lesser-known tracks as well, and the sound is excellent, as is the material.  Sure, I could have done without the \\"disco-rock\\" of \\"Hot Stuff\\", but almost eveything else is great.    Keith Richards' bluesy rhythm guitar playing is rock-steady all the way through, and the Stones do a killer rendition of the mean, sleazy blues-rocker \\"Star Star\\" (which isn't the song's actual title, but they weren't allowed to put \\"Starf**ker\\" on the cover of \\"Goat's Head Soup\\", the album where it originally appeared).  They groove on the slow blues \\"You Gotta Move\\" and perform excellent live versions of \\"It's Only Rock 'N' Roll\\" and the irresistable \\"Brown Sugar\\", and the seven-minute epic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is raw and menacing.    New lead guitarist Ron Wood fills Mick Taylor's shoes with no problem, and the band's sound is fleshed out by keyboardist/organist Billy Preston (who played with the Beatles) and pianist Ian Steward, the original sixth Stone. Stewart in particular plays some wonderful boogie piano.    The band tackles the classics during a little \\"blues set\\" on disc two, performing a surprisingly authentic-sounding \\"Mannish Boy\\" (the Muddy Waters classic), a superbly groovy \\"Crackin' Up\\" (I'm not sure that's what he sings during the chorus, though), and a fine take on Howlin' Wolf's \\"The Little Red Rooster\\" with some great slide guitar. Okay, so Jagger isn't the Wolf, but he does a pretty good job.    This fine album can be enjoyed by hardcore fans and more casual ones alike, since it boasts a strong song selection as well as showcasing some lesser-known gems that don't usually show up on various Stones compilations.
B00005K9LK|4.0|screaming for veneance ranks as one of judas priests best cds.fever,you got another thing coming,the title track and bloodstone are all great metal classics.the rest of the tracks are pretty damn good too.a great metal cd all judas priest fans should have.
B000002UB3|4.0|I have said before that I am not a big Beatles fan, and I'm not but the albums I do own are great, and this is no exception. Abbey Road is a great Beatles album, and not to mention their last! There is not onebad song here except.....'Because' I know you Beatless fans probly wont agree but I think that song blows! I mean its dredfully boring! But other then that this album is flawless. 'Octapus's Garden' was surprisingly good, concedering Ringo wrote and sang lead on it and George's guitar playing is at its best there and on the hole album for that matter! I really think this was George's album, with the two songs he wrote (Something, Here Comes The Sun) are the two best songs, and his guitar playing is the best highlight, that is besides Lennons lyrics! This really is one of the best albums of all time, its ashamed the Beatles didnt make more like this instead of Let It BE!
B000003TAB|4.0|Get this album only after you're sick and tired of listening to Nevermind, In Utero, Bleach, and Unplugged in New York. Why? Because it's probably the their worst record. They couldn't make it as a studio album, but since Cobain was intent in getting rid of his 10 million fans who bought Nevermind (well, he admitted he couldn't get rid of the odd half million people who would be diehard fans of Nirvana no matter what and would buy anything half-decent and putrid they'd release), so he put out this album. This album is not nearly as accessible as Nevermind, certainly not as mainstream as it. The only hints of Pop you'd hear would be in &quot;Sliver&quot; (the best song in the album, and would be made into a video that only then managed to make this record hit gold). <BR>There's other good songs as well. Downer is probably the next best song. Kurt's mumbling so fast, if it wasn't for the loud, blaring quitars, you'd mistake it for a Rap song. Hairspray Queen had a catchy, sorta funky bass and Kurt screamed and screeched like someone dying...it was pretty cool song overall. I didn't like the three songs after that, Mexican Seafood, Big Long Now and Aero Zeppelin. They were too boring and slow for my taste and didn't quite song like a Nirvana song. But it ended quite nicely with Aneursym. <BR>Molly's Lip, Polly and Been A Song are also worth mentioning. The rest aren't all that great.<BR>Best advice i can give you is for you not to buy this unless you're starving for new Nirvana material. Or you're really into underground punk or grunge, because that's what this record really is. And that's how Nirvana started.
B000002LND|5.0|Listening to this album, you'll understand why Madonna is so famous.  Not only is she a talented show woman who remakes herself over and over again, the music is great.  Every song on this album is a gem.  Whether its sexy (La Isla Bonita, Justify my Love, Like a Virgin), fun to dance to (Into the Groove, Holiday, Material Girl, Express Yourself), an emotional ballad (Live to Tell, Crazy for You) or a just great (Vogue, Papa Don't Preach, Lucky Star, etc.) its perfect.  Every song on this collection is amazing and I guarantee that you'll love it.  This is what got me into Madonna in the first place.  Get all of her music!
B00005M91K|5.0|The images and sounds will take you beyond your usual perceptions, and will coninue to flash through your mind days after watching it.  The universe will seem a lot friendlier and smaller, and a freedom of thought and spirit will capture you as the result of this mangifient artistry. Baraka is a Bravo.
B000089CJI|5.0|Every morning I walk to the subway station listening new music in my discman. A week ago I downloaded some songs from this album, and \\"Give Up\\" became my instant personal morning soundtrack. The next day I had to buy the CD from Amazon, because in my country it is unlikely to be released soon. <BR>It is a brilliant piece of pop music, with happy-melancholic hues and catchy tunes like \\"...dont wake me up, I plan on sleeeping in\\".
B00005JL3A|5.0|My friend rented this movie and Ghost Ship one day. We watched both, and before we watched them he said Ghost Ship was better than Resident Evil. But after they were both over, i had to disagree. Resident Evil was an excellent action-packed thriller that is a awesome movie based on a Playstation game. The special effects on that big creature thing are so-so, but the zombies are well done. The part where the military commando guy was pulled into a room full of zombies gave me shivers and I can't imagine what that would feel like and it gave me chills just thinking about 50 or more zombies pulling at me and taking chomps out my face. But anyways, it has a good story and its not what i thought it would be; running around blasting at zombies. The ending is cool, in where Jill steps out of the hospital to find Raccoon City taken over by zombies. That tells you that there will be more movies, and that sends a happy chill up my spine. The director of this movie is same director of Mortal Kombat, which was a laugh and a half. Some parts were good, but PLEASE! Milla Jonavich and Michelle Rodriguez deserve a pat on the back for their outstanding roles, but that other guy Eric Mabius, he was a little weird. But honestly, if your looking for a fresh new horror flick, stumble like a zombie into your local video store and grab Resident Evil before it grabs you, and trust me, it will!
B000002LIX|5.0|I read the amazon.com review and I have to say I disagree.  Every song on this album is a masterpiece, nothing is \\"too long\\" its all perfect.  Jane's Addiction is my all time favorite band and all though I personaly liked Nothings Shocking better than Ritual, it's still phenomenal! Three Days is my favorite song on the album in addition to Stop, and Been Caught Stealing. Buy this album, you'll love it!
0312263120|1.0|Plot is a mindless string of cliches.  From the technical standpoint, the book is filled with nonsensical mumbo jumbo that will immiediately annoy anybody who's ever used a computer.  All of the so-called &quot;computer science&quot; is simply made up, with no basis in reality.  Read it if you want to waste time and learn nothing.  Terrible.<br />p.s.  I thought Da Vinci Code was excellent.  What a disappointment this is.
B000001IPP|5.0|This was the first Rancid cd I ever owned way back in like 95, and it is still by far my favorite cd. Unfortunately it got stolen out of my car last year and ever since then I've been going crazy. If you've only heard new Rancid DEFINITELY pick this one up cause you'll love it guaranteed! And if you've heard Time Bomb and Ruby Soho and you think that's what Rancid usually sounds like think again, this here is classic Rancid.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Times change.  Music evolves.  If you say &quot;NOFX is slipping, they're not what they used to be&quot;, then I say &quot;Good!&quot;  If you want to stay in your little dank box and think that everything should sound like L.A. punk from the early and mid-80's, then you might as well put on a tye-dye and go hang with all the hippies who are still crying over Jerry Garcia.<br />Why not sit back, listen to some fine music, and just be entertained for once!  Christ!  If I wanted to hear a bunch of babies cry, I'd go back to nursery school!<br />And by the way, they could all still kick the crud out of you anyway!<br />Viva La Revolucion!
B00008OLYN|5.0|I believe that in making &quot;Damnation&quot;, Opeth were testing their listeners, challenging them to see if people could handle a drastic deviation from the norm.  Many of Opeth's fans are undoubtedly prog metal and death metal fans, who might find this album to be a bit of a curve ball.  Well, unfortunately, it would appear that a lot of people just couldn't open their minds to this new direction, but I for one think it's great.<br />Ok, let's be fair.  I can see how this album might be a bit difficult to get into for some. This album is soft.  Really soft.  Possibly the softest album I've ever bought (including alternative rock albums).  The songs are overall very uniform, and seemingly repetitive at times.  Naturally, this means that this album requires a good attention span, and an eye for detail.  But if you think about it, aren't all of Opeth's albums like that?<br />Anyway, despite everything I just said, I think this is an excellent and engaging album, that never gets boring for a second.  The melodies are catchy and beautiful, and the musicianship is great.  This may be a peaceful, laid-back album, but there's still plenty of technical stuff going on here.  Drummer Martin Lopez is especially worth a mention.  He's always done great work, but here he shines like never before.  Here, his jazz expertise is much more evident, with some very textured and intricate drumming.  The guitar playing consists mostly of clean electric, with some acoustic mixed in for good measure.  Very nice melodic rhythms, and great emotional solos.  Oh, and Akerfeldt's vocals are great.  Yeah, there's no awesome death vox, but he still stands out.<br />As for best songs, some of my favorites are &quot;Windowpane&quot;, &quot;Hope Leaves&quot;, and the mournful closer &quot;Weakness&quot;.  &quot;Closure&quot; is also worth a mention. It's a bit more rocking than the rest (although still not &quot;heavy&quot; by any means), and the abrupt transition into &quot;Hope Leaves&quot; is just killer.  Not a bad song to be found here, though.  Every song is catchy, memorable, and very soothing.  Plus, the song-lengths are a bit shorter than usual, which I think is a good thing.  Without the heavy-to-soft dynamics, an album full of 10-minute epics might have been a bit much.<br />Anyway, I for one think this experiment was a success.  It's probably my least favorite Opeth album, because it lacks two of the main things that make their music so incredible:<br />1. Their ability to write long epics that never get boring.<br />2. The aforementioned heavy-to-soft dynamics, which IMO, are second to none.<br />But, if this is the closest thing to a &quot;bad&quot; album that Opeth ever makes, then they won't be dropping out of my list of favorites any time soon.just killer.

0385503954|5.0|This is the first book I read from Ian McEwan and I have to say that I will definitely buy his other works. I started this book without knowing what it'll be about. The first few pages drew me in not because of the plot, but because of the prose. The book is written beautifully, words convey very well the nuances and emotions of people without having to go into too many details. Very good characterization. The ending came as a shock to me, but I loved it. The only thing I didn't like about this book was part 2 where there was too much detail about the Dunkirk retreat.
B00005B36H|5.0|One of the best metal bands in the business, Tool, has produced an album that is an amazing listening experience. Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima are all great albums, but I think that Lateralus blows them all away. What sets this album apart from those of other metal bands is the fact that Tool has taken heavy metal and raised it to a certain level of refinement. Also, while it is true that the last four songs on the CD are not their best work, they are not that bad. I actually like &quot;Triad&quot; because its musical structure reminds me of Pink Floyd's song &quot;One of These Days.&quot;<br />This brings me to my second point. For me, Lateralus, like Tool's other three albums, is reminiscent of Pink Floyd. Being an avid Pink Floyd fan, I notice that some of the music's characteristics are distinctively Floydian. Perhaps most noticeable is the length of most of the songs. Lateralus features extended instrumentals, which can be found in much of Pink Floyd's work. Add to that meaningful, thought-provoking lyrics. Also, Tool belongs in the prog/art rock genre, which is very similar. In my opinion, Tool is what Pink Floyd would be if they[Pink Floyd] became a metal band.<br />Another reason Lateralus rocks is because the band's four musicians mesh extremely well together, and at the same time are masters of their respective positions. My personal favorites are Maynard James Keenan's high-powered vocals and Danny Carey's impressive, accurate drumming. The album is all the way around a masterwork. If you have even the slightest interest in Pink Floyd and heavy metal, I strongly recommend Lateralus as well as its predecessors.
0793518326|5.0|As has been written  on-line at Amazon this book has a number of errors.  However I think this is likely the closest we are ever going to come to getting a look at George Martin's arrangements of the Beatles' songs.  Furthermore given that George and John are no longer with us and Sir George Martin is aging, I doubt  that we're going to see anything better or more accurate, at least in my lifetime.  My first purchase of sheet music almost 30 years ago was a book called \\"Beatles Complete.\\"  This publication covered the Northern Songs catalog and not much else.  Additionally it wasn't annotated correctly and most of the songs weren't in the key that the Beatles had written them in but I perservered and made notes in the margins.  I'll do the same with this book.

B00005JMCR|4.0|I've read some of the reviews the critics give this movie, and I see things a bit differently. This movie like the other \\"American Pie\\" movies does what its meant to do, be funny in a crude way. I don't think it was intend to be educational, or be a serious movie that will earn them academy awards. And that's what the critics seem to compare movies too. <br />Some critics have said, \\"The jokes are unemotional, uncouth and mostly unfunny.\\" I disagree, good thing we all have our own opinions. I thought this movie was just as funny as the first two American Pies. There are certain things we expect already before watching this movie, such as Jim being clumsy and always finding ways to embarrass himself (I think that's funny). <br />\\"Disposable as toilet paper, 'American Wedding' raises the question of how far mainstream the gross-out comedy can go.\\" Disagree; this movie is a make-you-feel-good movie. The main plot of the movie revolves around the wedding and everything some people go through when getting married, and the movie delivers on all that you might expect an American Wedding to be. Furthermore, the mainstream audience that watches mainstream movies might enjoy this much more than the out-of-it-I-don't-know-what-the-public-really-likes critic.<br />\\"By this stage, though, the whole exercise is so dragged out and watered down, it's essentially a series of gross-out gags with bits of dialogue tying them together.\\" I think what this critic is missing is that, that's what the public wants. We, the public, do not watch American Pies for educational rewards. We want to be grossed out; we want to see our favorite actors/actresses in situations that we hope we're never in. I say give us more!<br />There you have it, the other side of the coin. I enjoyed it and I will recommend it. Everyone out there will make up his or her own minds. Be assured though, everything that made up the pervious American Pies is consistent with this American Wedding. (Except some of the cast).<br />Getz515
0201633612|1.0|It is too bad other experienced authors like Stephen Prata, Stephen Kochan or Ivor Horton didn't write this book. These authors write books that can be easily assimilated.

B00006RINF|5.0|Excellent album, but only for those who have taste!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This C.D. is among the most innovative I have ever heard in the realm of rock and roll; surely it is destined to become a classic a few years down the road from here. I also believe that this represents an extremely important turning point in modern rock itself: if you listen to the radio, you realize how much whiny bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Staind, Trapt, etc...are destroying the very foundations of what rock is and ought to be--music. Such bands are indulging in catchy pop choruses and hackneyed lyrical slogans that have become equally commercial as the supposed \\"repression\\" which they are against. Furthermore, most modern bands have almost no understanding that the most important aspect of music is, well--the notes. The majority of current bands receiving radio play are catering to the wave of would-be Hot Topic punks who are no more intellectual than a dead fish; the kids buy the C.D.'s because the lyrics make them feel rebellious and/or intelligent. However, if you want to get a message across with words, you need to write a book or a publication and leave the world of music to actual musicians.<BR>Queens of the Stone Age have crafted a masterpiece which sends a far more pessimistic message about modern culture than Saliva could ever dream of. How did they do it? Through highly lush and complex, at times merciless progressions, ingenious riffs and meticulously planned vocal schemes which range from silly and sarcastically macabre to haunting and defiant. There is also a mock metal song which is a bit silly(although most of the things that Nick Oliveri sings are a little tongue in cheek, I suspect). My only complaint about this are the tedious radio dialogues, which could be deleted and are probably only in there in order to prevent people from burning mixes with the two singles. Anyway, the album is best listened to as a congruent whole, as the entire C.D. builds up to its triumphant, brazen conclusion, A SONG FOR THE DEAF, which is without a doubt the single best song of this decade--in my opinion, of course.<BR>In summary, many people may not think that rock and roll is real music--that what is popular is simply designed to feed a proletariot culture that wants simply to have its capricious emotional appetites stuffed with basically crap. And that is true...just in most cases. While SONGS FOR THE DEAF may not be a symphony, it is an imaginative social criticism of the modern age that can legitimately be called music--very good music, at that; the Queens of the Stone Age have found a way to strike new notes, and if you actually pay attention to SONGS FOR THE DEAF and give it a chance, you might find that the old notes you're used to hearing really aren't that good. But like anything brilliant, this C.D. will remain under-appreciated by the radio and the vast majority of western civilization(the musical situation in Europe is in far greater crisis than it is here in the U.S. and Canada). Yes, I recommend it.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I would reccomend this movie to anyone. Even people who generally hate musicals would like this one, because its not like some guy is walking down the street and suddenly bursts into dance and song and magically everyone else suddenly knows the dance moves. It all takes place in the mind of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) the main charecter, a person who is obsessed with fame so it makes sense that she would dream all this up. It all starts when the vaudville singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) kills her husband and sister, she rushes to the Onyx theater because she has to preform. So as shes singing All That Jazz you see Roxie Hart watching her every move because she herself wants to be just like Velma. She leaves with the man that she is having an affair with, because he promises her he can get her an act. When Roxie finally discovers that her lover is a phony and liar she shoots him. Roxie tries to get herself out of what she has done by making  her husband tell the police  that the guy was a burglar. But as always the police find out the truth and arrest Roxie for murder. At the Cook County jail she meets up with Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton, Billy Flynn a smooth talking lawyer, and Velma Kelly her idol. She hires Billy and starts stealing Velmas head lines and I have to stop there because I might say too much if I go on. I've heard that they wanted Goldie Hawn,Nicole Kidman Gwyneth Paltrow, and Cameron Diaz for the role of Roxie. Goldie Hawn is much to perky, and to old (sorry Goldie) Nicole Kidman is to tall an to elegant to take on a role like this, as for the other two I could never see them as Roxie. For Velma Kelly they considered Madonna who couldve done ok but Catherine WAS Velma Kelly and NO ONE couldve done better. They considered Kathy Bates & Rosie O'Donnel for Mama, Kathy Bates wouldve been ok but Rosie O'Donnell is just to ....... well Rosie! :)  Anyways the cast is awesome, so I could never see anyone else in their roles. Well, buy this DVD or rent it,but im sure you will love it!
B00005JLT5|5.0|I am surprised I did not hear more about this film when it was in theaters. It is an amazing film. Well crafted.
B00006BTCA|5.0|YES Members of GENERATION Y you heard it from the great MILKBABY I proclaim \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" to be one of the most Profound records for my Generation or at least for the people in my age group(i'm 18)which is the 16 to 21 bracket.Why you ask, MES just gits this baby feeling,oh yeah now I know why because Interpol has rabid fan base and its growing even as I type this,Milk.Interpol is loved by open minded music fans everywhere,Goths,some punks and Indie rock kids so unlike many of the \\"the\\" BANDS Interpol has wide appeal I myself am a gothic baby.Now time to describe this classic Album,you don't need the Milkbaby to tell what genre of music this band comes from or what they sound like,you have all the mention's of Joy Division,Echo and the Bunnymen,The Smiths(I don't know how they got in there)Pyshcadelic Furs,The Cure,oh lets not forget the Kitchens of Distinction and the Afghan Wigs 2 bands that Interpol sound the closest too.Now I was a fan of these Bands before I knew who Interpol was and to be honest with you I thought they were just ripping off those aforementioned bands,you see I heard about them during the summer of 02 and finally bought the album in December,but only thought it was alright,I did'nt fall in love with the album until January,I went for a walk on a cold night with this album playing on my headsets and it was just wonderful the moonlight made it special,I then realized how different Interpol was for it's time and for all you whiny Gen X'ers who say this has been done before well let this Milkbaby tell you something it hasn't been done for us,Fischerspooner ladytron and Interpol are our New Wave,Milk,but generation x has a better musical taste then my generation I will say.<br />Oh yeah I forgot to tell you about one more magical Interpol moment that took place in late January,I listened to Interpol and Joy Division in the Dark in my room with a blue light to illuminate the room with a strange blue glow,I felt as though I had traveledthrough a time warp to the early 80's.Yes I would go onto have many more magical moments with Interpol walking thru downtown,walking while it was snowing,Milkbaby did all this while listening to Interpol,I also listen to them while at the cemetary to when it was cloudy and misting outside very cool.Oh wait I said I was going to describe this album Milk,you take the aforementioned bands and you drop them in blender with early U2 and Radiohead-Ok Computer add a dash of David Byrn of The Talking heads and one band you won't hear mentioned with Interpol is the Moody Blues,well Paul Banks sounds a little bit like the lead singer of the Moody Blues.Now on to the Songs i'll describe each one individually.<BR>1.Untitled=Chameleons Uk meet Shoegazing,Very Atmospheric<BR>2.Obstacle 1=Brooding like the fall,Radio friendly when they edited out the best part of it.<BR>3.NYC=sounds a little like REM.<BR>4.PDA=RADIO friendly Joy Division in-way<BR>5.Say

Bauhaus<BR>8.Stella was a diver and she was always down=They made this song there own.<BR>9.Roland=they also made this song too there own.Gothic Secret Agent.<BR>10.The New=Gothic U2 with some fugazi.<BR>11.Leif Erikson=Best Track on the whole album,could have been a joy division song,all the other tracks are Melancholy but this one dives into the realm of depressing.Listen to this in cematary at NIGHT OOOOOO, or when it's cloudy but not when it's sunny.This Song sounds best at night.<br />WELL I HOPED THAT HELPED YOU TO MAKE THE DESCISION TO BUY THIS ALBUM.INDIE rock is watered down but Interpol are above the B.S. of Mainstream music and Indie music.To all young Interpol fans don't try to convert yer Pseudo-Punk friends or Slipknot fans to this music they won't like it,you know it's not Blink 182,Sum41,or Slipknot,this music is too artistic and sophesticated for them they won't understand it,but give them time by decades end they'll be loving this band(not everyone liked REM when they came out)and don't call this bad-emo i'll squirt BABIES MILK on you this is GOTHIC RIGHT HERE, Years from now many depressed Gothic GIRLS WILL BE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM ,MOST

LIGHTS,YAY,MILK,OH YEAH NOT FLAVOR OF THE MONTH BUT FLAVOR OF THE BABY DECADE.MILK
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw has hit on something rare with this album.  No single aspect of this work is particularly original, but somehow when you take the whole package--the piano, voice, lyrics, and band--you cannot deny it is something special.  <br />I also caught him on Last Call with Carson Daly, and am planning on catching a live show at the first opportunity.  This guy can entertain!
B00004TDTO|5.0|&quot;Jaws&quot; is probably my favorite Steven Spielberg film, and also one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. The three actors [Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss] are so perfect in their roles. Their chemistry is dead-on and extremely engaging. The scene where Shaw and Dreyfuss are comparing their scars is priceless; my favorite scene in the film. This was Spielberg's first big film, and I think it's his most perfect and entertaining.
B00009UW0N|2.0|Be warned, the remastering of the movie might be crystal clear, but it completely erased the wonderful use of the colors blue and orange in Dean Cundy's photography.  No amount of extras are worth a washed out print.
B00005JKN9|1.0|This was probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. For two hours, it's a well done revenge story, albeit rather predictable. DiCaprio comes through stronger than I thought, but something is still missing, which lends an element of plasticity to his character. Daniel Day-Lewis, however, is an excellent villain, and despite my dislike of the film itself, I chalk him up with the likes of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. He's just plain that creepy, that brutal, and that evil. <br />The movie's failing lies not in its casting, however, nor its aspirations for period authenticity and the like. The issue is that two hours into the movie, Scorsese attempts to shift the focus from \\"big fish in a little pond\\" gang warfare to a heavyhanded push on failed revenge, oppression of the impoverished, crooked politicians, and a thundering fiasco of a finale that obliterates all remaining sense from the film. Many of the issues are skimmed over and thrown as plot suckerpunches at the end, with little buildup nor lasting resolution, leaving me to feel as if I had watched one movie about Leo getting revenge on Daniel with an additional hour sequel attached that bounces from topic to topic. The very end, without revealing too much, is just plain silly as it attempts to pull a few heartstrings. In this reviewer's eyes, it fails.
6304806442|5.0|I was first drawn to this movie because of Ewan McGregor, so I didn't know that much about the storyline, just that it had to do with heroin addiction. When I finally saw the movie, I was really amazed at how well the actors protrayed the addicts. The plot focuses around a group of friends living in Europe (I think Scotland) who are heroin addicts. Ewan plays the main character, Renton. Her narrates throughout the movie. The movie just follows the paths of all these characters through their addictions and the consequences of them. The DVD box says they plan a big heist, but it's really near the end of the movie when they plan to sell a whole of heroin for money, that's the big &quot;heist.&quot; This movie was a little depressing, so if you don't like being a little depressed, then don't watch it. But all and all, I recomend this movie to anyone!
B000001A3H|4.0|I happened upon Kyuss while casually searching on this site for a new CD to add to my collection.  I intended to pick up a Fu Manchu disc but decided on this CD by Kyuss based on reviews and the short sound clips.  I bought it just yesterday.  I have no regrets, these cats rock.  I am a pretty big Metallica fan and although Kyuss has a different sound I like the way their music is similar to Metallica's in that the songs are put together (arranged?) in the same style.  (That's how I hear it, I am no musician, it's just the way I happen to interpret it)  I honestly like every song and I know I will appreciate it even more after a couple more plays.<br />Minor complaint:  At times, their sound (like on Thumb) is strange enough that it can make a decent system like I have at home sound fairly [bad] at first. Nothing a little tweaking of the EQ can't fix but not exactly what I want to mess around with when I put in a CD.  So along with Kyuss' unique and awesome sound comes a strange mix of unique and awesome sound.  You see?
0061020710|4.0|This is the first Discworld novel there is, and coincidently, the first one i have read. I was a little put off by the strange names for many things, but after getting used to them, i quite enjoyed this book. Rincewind and Death were pretty amusing. I think i will scour the used book shops for a few more discworld books as i am not sure that i want to commit to reading all 25 just yet. I am going to try to find some of the more popular ones, and then i will be able to make a more informed decision. I read this because the series is so famous, but i am not sure that i can make a judgement just yet as top if i am hooked or not. That being said about my long term feelings, i definatly thought that this book was worth reading, even for a person not likely to read the series. It was a nice change to have characters in a fantasy world who were not too serious about portraying the world as dark and dreary...find a copy of this book and read it on a rainy day...
B00005KFUM|5.0|Er...blistering, mind-blowing, ear-shattering? This album is a work of wailing, emotional genius. From the rasping riff of 'newborn' to the organ finale of 'megalomania', origin is an album that shows that muse have lost none of the quality shown in 'showbiz'. The expansive use of superbly inspiring guitar and classical piano lends itself perfectly to an album that blows away all preconceptions - this a quality set of tracks by a quality band.
B00005JMCR|5.0|I saw this movie on it's first showing, and I have to say, if it wasn't the best out of the three, it was pretty close. Jesse Dylan's direstion of this movie was excellent. I don't even need to tell how good the actor/actresses were in this movie, as well as the others. And to end this, I think the series ended the way it should, but I just hope that no one gets the smart idea to make a fourth. It takes to much risk at ruining the series they had going.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have read many reviews of this album, and they always compare it with their past albums. And when I listened to it, Radiohead has come along this far. The band is keep growing up. HTTT sounds more silent but with great braveness. All songs are good and A Punchup at a Wedding is their stand-out song for me.
B00004Z459|5.0|linkin park has always been an awesome band even when they were called &quot;hybrid theory&quot;  but this CD made them break into the music world all over the place its one of their best cds
B000001FTD|5.0|Not one weak song.  Followed up by somewhat of a low point, State Of Euphoria.  Starting with Persitence Of Time, Anthrax took a bit of a darker turn and the world is a better place for it.  Check out We've Come For You All right now if you haven't already.  Don't forget Stomp442 and Volume 8.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This album is just amazing. All the songs from different Floyd eras are mixed in together to make one big continous song or life story. Songs like 'High Hopes' from Floyds latest album 'Division Bell' flow into 'Bike' from their first album 'PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN'. The band obviously want you to see the contrast and it works really well.<BR>                                             Pink floyd have released many albums and this album gives you an oppertunity to hear stuff from albums you dont have. I had never heard the 'Momentary Lapse of reason album' but the song 'sorrow' from it is here and it is just awesome.<BR>                                      All the floyd greats are here 'Shine on u crazy...', 'Another Brick in the wall' 'Wish u were here' and of course 'Echoes'. There is an unreleased track 'When the tigers broke free'. It is a typical dour Waters number written about how his dad went to war but never came back.<BR>     There is a cliche that all best of albums is a good place to start for new fans. That cliche most certaintly applies here yet, this is more of an album than just a mere compilation and with the new mixes and remastering and just the sheer uniquness of the whole thing it is definitly worth buying for old fans. It is my favorite floyd album without a shadow of a doubt.
0962477060|3.0|Do not waste your money if you are not willing to put in a lot of time with this book.  I am not that great a player and I am on the second page after 3 months..admittedly I haven't had much time to play..but let this serve as a warning, this book isn't for someone who isn't serious about learning how to play the guitar
B00006M183|4.0|Like many other Pearl Jam fans, I wasn't too impressed with Binaural, so there was much skepticism as to what Riot Act was to sound like. Yield and No Code remain my favourites, but Riot Act has that accessible flavour that makes it difficult to dismiss the music; even those who may not be hardcore fans of the band. It's a solid rock record from start to end and shows Pearl Jam still can dish out arena rock songs (Save You, Love Boat Captain, Cropduster, I Am Mine, Green Disease) and ballad-esque sounds of Thumbing My Way & All Or None. Very easy listen and a good recommendation to the casual fans of the band.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the all time best &amp; most creative future fantasy events on film!!! Human beings are trapped within a computer program called &quot;The Matrix&quot;. In essence, that which was created, &quot;the computer program&quot;, artificial intelligence and machines, becomes the ruler and human beings are imprisoned within it. The concept and meaning of &quot;freedom&quot; takes on a whole new dimension. Neo, a young man in his late twenties, takes a ride in a car in 1999 and is held captive, at gun-point. He goes to a run-down building where he is introduced to &quot;Morpheus&quot;. Morpeus gives him a choice: select a blue or red capsule ... choose the &quot;the blue one&quot;, continue to live within the dream ... choose &quot;the red one&quot; and experience &quot;REALITY&quot;. Neo chooses the red one and the trip to the future begins ... complete with allusions to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. There is a scene where Neo is  sliding down a futurisitic tunnel, strangely resembling a laundry shoot.<br />The three main themes in the film are<br />1) humans have created computers, machines which become the rulers,i.e. control human beings. It seems like a forewarning ...<br />2) find your own path, get in touch with your belief system,<br />remain true to your values,<br />3) freedom means taking a chance, not knowing the outcome. It is sets human beings apart from the rest of creation. Taking risks, not knowing the future, THIS IS LIFE<br />There are phenomenal scenes involving kung fu and ju jitsu ... the realm of getting in touch with one's inner self is explored. There is an &quot;esoteric&quot; side throughout the film. When Neo is to meet with &quot;the Oracle&quot; a prophetess, Morpheus says words to this effect to Neo: &quot;I can show you the door. Feel your mind.  I can only show you how - you are the one who has to walk through it.&quot; Another memorable statment is &quot;To deny our own impulse is to deny the very thing that makes us human&quot;. In another scene there is a young boy, who looks like he is within a Zen temple, bending spoons through with his mind or thoughts. The youngster says to Neo: &quot;Do not try to bend the spoon. Only realize there is no spoon. You will realize, it is you that is bending  ... not the spoon.&quot; When a human being dies within the computer program ... their physical body dies, too. The reason given  &quot;without the mind, the body is dead.&quot; One of the Agents named Smith, says to Neo: &quot;Every mammal on the planet develops balance, except human beings, you consume and mulitply ... there is only one other organism that does that ... a virus. Human beings are a disease&quot;. Essentially it is a warning, do not get so out of balance,out of touch with reality, that you destroy yourself, and the planet ...<br />This thoroughly enjoyable film has artistic, entertainment and philosophical/humanistic value. It explores many facets of human behavior and the meaning &amp; purpose of life. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93)quot;.

B00008972S|4.0|The Special Limited Edition (SLE) is a major improvement in sound quality.  On the original DVD release, while supposedly sporting 5.1 sound, the rear speakers stay silent during almost the entire movie.  Not so on the SLE version, which does a much better job of immersing you in the audio.<br />If only I could say the same for the video transfer.  I had high hopes when I read that the video transfer was new, and was disappointed when I saw that the picture on the SLE version was almost indistinguishable from the original DVD. The SLE version still displays some frame jitters and occasional motion artifacts, just like the original DVD, even on a progressive scan DVD player. <br />The extra material is OK, but only a true diehard fan would be interested in reading the original script or the original lobby program guide.  Much of the material is difficult to read, because of the small size of the book.<br />So we will call it a hit and a miss.  Still one of the greatest movies ever, and if you don't already own it, I highly recommend it. But if you already own the original DVD, I would be hard-pressed to justify spending an extra [money amount]for the small amounts of extra material and improvements in the SLE version.
B000003S09|5.0|King Crimson came about in early 1969. The band, regarded by many as the ones who started &quot;progressive rock&quot; as we know it, consisted of Robert Fripp (guitar), Greg Lake (bass/vocals), Ian McDonald (flute/piano/mellotron/etc.), Mike Giles (drums), and Pete Sinfield (&quot;words and illumination&quot;). This was the original lineup that stayed together from January till December 1969. As far as I am concerned this is their best, most famous lineup.<BR>'In the Court of the Crimson King' is a majestic album, one of the best debuts ever recorded. It starts out with the explosive '21st Century Schizoid Man.' This song is an awesome classic. Although many call it an FM staple I've yet to hear it on my local classic rock stations (102.9 WMGK or 94.5 THE HAWK). Still though. Its scary as hell too as it starts out very silently. About 20 or so seconds into it, the main riff (which Lake has often said, he wrote) starts out. Its intense and very insane. When I go to sleep I listen to this song in the dark. I'm soooo freaked out by it that I feel as though &quot;the screaming man&quot; on the cover is going to come after me or something. The cover by the way is freaky by itself (it was designed by artist Barry Godber who I found out had died a few months after the album's release in February of 1970)<BR>'Schizoid Man' is well worth its admission.
B00005JL78|4.0|In the theater, the film had such a busy surface I wasn't sure it would reward closer scrutiny, until I bought it -- and the parallels to an ancient warning jumped off the screen.  <br />Other reviewers have taken issue with its shortcomings as \\"hard science fiction\\" -- which I won't defend, except to relate something more profound going on.  At a time when many Americans have forgotten Patrick Henry, and are willing to trade privacy, freedom, and due process for assurances of safety, Minority Report updates the grim insight of Sophocles in \\"Oedipus Rex\\": seeing the future can be a ruinous curse.  <br />This story of a prince who unknowingly slew the father who exiled him (after a prophecy that he would), married his mother, and put out his eyes with his mother's brooches when he learned what he'd done, is symbolically re-enacted in the opening pre-crime: the predicted killer is a desperate, pathetic man whose adulterous wife has made his son into his successor with the same clothes and hairstyle; the kid memorizes a speech by Abraham Lincoln (who, like Oedipus, presided over a divided, despairing country) while poking holes in the eyes of a Lincoln mask with the scissors, which will be the murder weapon. The perp is led away in a sort of induced oblivion, like Oedipus being led blind from his kingdom. <br />But Tom Cruise will be Oedipus; his father figure Max von Sydow abets his escape from his own police agency but is actually plotting his ruin, replaying the role of Oedipus' father king.  <br />The prophecy of Tom committing murder comes from the androgynous Samantha Morton, who is effectively blind to her environment (the opening shot is a zoom-back from her pupil). The prophecy of Oedipus murdering his father came from a blind prophet -- who had lived part of his life as a female. <br />Lois Smith is Tom's mother figure, who tells him she and von Sydow considered themselves \\"the mother and father of pre-crime.\\"  She doesn't sleep with Tom but does kiss him ina well-timed gag on Tom's sex appeal.  She also tells him that everything he does to avert his predicted crime will only bring it about -- the same trap prophesied for Oedipus and his father. <br />Because retinas identify future citizens, there's a black market in eyeballs and drug dealers are eyeless.  When after the prediction of his own crime Tom arranges to have his incriminating eyeballs changed out, he's asked why he wants to keep them; he means to re-enter his police station, but his facetious reply, \\"Because my mother gave them to me,\\" recalls Oedipus putting out his eyes with his mother's brooches.  <br />At the end, Tom discovers von Sydow's plot against him, intended to assure the success and expansion of the pre-crime program, and implicates him in the murder of Agatha's mother, who had wanted her daughter back after having given her up.  <br />The film is not an airtight science fiction yarn, but is a resonant drama of human yearning against our limits: the older man who can end all murders, if only he can get away with committing one; the younger man who can redeem himself either by proving his agency prevents murder, or by murdering the man he takes for his own son's killer -- a classically neat opposition of humanity's strongest moral drives, agonizingly resolved in Tom's decision to simply arrest the man. <br />The story is densely-woven but fastpaced, the dialogue good, often literate, with no wasted lines. Spielberg leaves behind his Child Within, except in the cop-out (noted in other reviews) of Tom shrugging at the dehumanizing slavery of the precogs, and Samantha Morton not despising him for it.  The effects are good, although we don't really need all the DVD extras, which depict a mutual-admiration society among the production team gushing over how great each other is.  Many scenes crackle with tension, which is often broken by Hitchcock-style anti-cliche' surprises (for reference, see how by using a blind man, circus freaks and a carful of spies singing \\"Tonight We Love\\", Hitch avoided in \\"Saboteur\\" what were already spy-movie cliche's by 1943.  In fact, \\"Saboteur\\" has many parallels with \\"Minority Report\\").  <br />The cast is excellent, although poor Jessica Harper has no dialogue.  There are several near-brilliant scenes: the Lois Smith encounter; the sleazy eye-doctor; the tenement raid, which is both funny and deeply creepy, and ends with a grinning cop delighted to break for pizza.  And there's Tom's clever selection of Schubert's \\"Unfinished Symphony\\" while he studies murders that will be unconsummated.

0805047905|5.0|\\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\\" has to be my 2 year old's favorite book.  We read it on a daily basis and it never fails to amaze me how interested my son is in turning the page.  Big, colorful pictures aid young children in learning colors, mastering the names of animals, and appreciate the tiny bit of anticipation the book offers.  A wonderful book for any young child's library.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I, for the most, part watch movies for their entertainment value. And in the case of Chicago I was not dissappointed! Great story, excellent musical score and creative cinematogrophy. I found myself replaying several musical numbers in my mind for days following my first viewing. An excellent return to the musical genre!
B00005JLTN|5.0|OBVIOUSLY, NOBODY CAN BEAT THE ORIGINAL MATRIX. THE ORIGINAL WAS A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. THE MATRIX RELOADED IS GREAT. THE STORY IS AWESOME. IT IS WORTH SEEING 2,3,4, TIMES ...IT IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE. I GAVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT STILL KEPT IT'S ORIGINALITY AND THE STUNTS ARE STILL JAW DROPPING! I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE STORY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TRILOGY OF THE CENTURY!
0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's survival book is a story told by a teenage boy's point of view.Sometimes funny, sometimes cynical but generally fun to read.I found the development of the book little bit slow.It may have done on purpose to have given the sense of boredom on the Pacific.Anyways I had a great time reading it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MOVIE JUST LIKE WHAT THAT DUDE SAID IN THE BEGINNING. IT WAS SO AWESOME, I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN. ANIME, CARTOONS, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. THE STORY WAS GREAT, ORIGINAL AND NO WONDER IT'S THE HIGHEST GROSSING FILM IN JAPAN. FOR AN ANIME, THIS IS ACTUALLY CHEAP!
0812932293|5.0|This is an autobiography of a child who was treated equally in his family.<BR>An autobiography of a child whose parents always praised for the good things rather than criticizing bad things.<BR>It is an autobiography of a NOTHING who became SOMEONE whose life<BR>is envied by billions today.<br />Autobiographies are always my first choices when I read and this was the best I ever read. In it you can flip through the pages of an extraordinary man who lived most of his life with one crazy<BR>idea &quot;Be willing to try anything Once&quot;. Believing in that he almost got killed a dozen of times, but after all it makes it really clear that only those who RISK-gain.<BR>And the main reason why you should read this book is - not even from &quot;1.000.000 jokes book&quot; you can't find as much material to laugh out loud as in this one. It's extremely funny as much as it is serious. I only wish there will be a movie based on this book and life of this man. <BR>Don't say you read books,if you didn't read this one.<BR>Have fun
B0000959N0|2.0|NOT ANOTHER CORNY SUPERHERO? HIS EYES GOT MESSED UP BUT HE IS STILL GOOD LOOKING. A LAWYER BY DAY, SUPER HERO BY NIGHT... SORRY THIS IS NOT WORTH IT! A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DON'T BUY IT, JUST RENT IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE BEN AFFLECK!
0142004235|5.0|I have become dismayed at the popular books out today.  The writing is predictable, shallow, and not very challenging.  I've decided to go back to the classics and East of Eden was first on my list, thanks to Oprah.  I found Steinbeck's writing style intriguing....specifically how he uses time/action lapses where everything isn't spelled out in black and white....you have to think, recall, use your imagination to fill in the gaps.  I do have a question for someone:  What was the significance of the word Timshel?  I remember it mentioned in the story but haven't been able to locate it to refresh my memory.  Could you help me out?
B00009TB5G|5.0|I WAS LATE WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE BUT NOT TOO LATE FOR IT'S SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THE FAMOUS COLUM...JUST A SIMPLE \\"WOW\\" WOULD DO! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!
B00000JPH6|5.0|THE STORY IS A TRUE JIM HENSON CLASSIC. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY FILM IN THE EARLY 80'S.  A GREAT COLLECTIBLE FOR ALL OF YOU FANTASY LOVERS OUT THERE!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I was skeptical at first... but something inspired me to purchase this DVD and I'm glad that I did.  Initially, I thought that a silent film wasn't \\"modern enough\\" for my tastes, but I was surprised to find that after about 10 minutes into the movie I had forgotten that it was a \\"silent\\" picture!<br /><br />The story told is so powerful, you easily become pulled into the story regardless of absent dialogue.  There are a few title cards, but none are needed at all as these truly talented actors have the extraordinary ability to express intense emotion without words (and without being overdramatic either)!  In addition, the music score expresses all of the emotion you need to comfortably transport you back into this golden era.<br /><br />The intense contrast in its visual design is so captivating, that you get pulled into the screen and will, no doubt, want to watch it several times to note the artistic details that you may have missed the first time around.  The restoration of this priceless film was absolutely perfect -- no hesitation in my 5-star rating!  Whether you are new to this genre or an old veteran, this should be an essential addition to any collection.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Despite all the grousings of fan boys out there, this movie captured the spirit of Daredevil and Elektra right out of the comics.  And the tone of the movie is perfectly rendered - dark and romantic, but never the depths of despair or too real.  Melodrama - reality with all the boring parts taken out!  That was Frank Miller's motto and that is what you get here.  Ben Affleck turns in a romantic and vioent turn as Matt Murdock, the first blind superhero in the Marvel universe.  And despite stunt celebrity casting somehow the rest of the cast is well matched.  Jennifer Garner does not have the Greek look or even the red costume of Elektra, but she can kick the [stuff] out of anybody and still look beautiful doing it.  Michael Clark Duncan plays Kingpin, and despite the white version found in the comics ... he's more than perfect.  And Collin Farrell as Bullseye is a joy to watch! The movie may try to move too quickly over so much territory, and sometimes it seems rushed.  But I was relieved to realize it was one hour and forty minutes, and not the bloated 2 hour plus running time of most comic book movies.  This is one the girls can get behind too, because Elektra is beautiful and deadly and the equal of any fighter in the movie.  It's fun, it's entertaining, and it moves like a runaway train!  What more can you ask for?Well... the DVD is tricked out with more features than you can imagine!  Two discs, commentary, documentaries, text commentary, behind the scenes branching, music videos, making of the movie and the history of the COMIC!  Each documentary runs as long or longer than the movie!  It's powerfully well done by Fox who always sets the bar and raises it.  There are Easter Eggs with outtakes, interviews with everyone down to the woman who sewed the coat for Bullseye.  Even if you find fault with the movie, you can't critize the DvD.  It's what dreams are made of.  And that's why I give it 5 stars!
0307155102|5.0|My son is in love with this book.  My 2 year old is actually using my copy of the book (26th printing, 1979) but this book really stands the test of time.  He has learned so many words with the aid of Richard Scarry, his most recent being 'fire truck'.  Colorful pictures capture and hold his interest and the array of subject matter in the book is incredible:  At the supermarket, various seasons and holidays, shapes and sizes, in the flower garden, clean-up time and so much more.  Childhood would not be the same without Richard Scarry.  No child should be without this book.
B00005JM09|2.0|The latest installment in the \\"Terminator\\" franchise is neither the tense thriller that the original was or the special effects tour-de-force blockbuster that the sequel was. Not only is Arnold Schwarzenegger the only returning cast member but the series creator, Cameron, is in no way involved either. On its own merits, T-3 is a loud and exciting popcorn movie but as an entry in one of the best sci-film series today, it is a borderline disaster.<br />Twelves year after T-2, John Connor is a loner walking the Earth (ala Kane in \\"Kung-Fu\\"), refusing to deal with the past and not wanting to except his role in the future. Enter T-X (Kristen Lokken), a lady terminator that is even more advanced than the previous T-1000 model. Her mission is to eliminate Connor and his future liutenants before they can rise up and lead the resistance to victory. As is always the case, the resistance has sent a Terminator of their own back in time to protect him. Sadly, the appeal of Schwarzennegger as the Terminator is somewhat lost in this newer film. He is no longer the comical yet indestructible father-figure trying to understand human emotions. Now, he's just some one-dimensional cyborg throwing around and blowing things up like nobody's business.<br />Once you look past the excitement and drama in this third entry, you notice how little it has to offer, story-wise. None of the characters seem to have any depth to them. Where in the last film, The Terminator grew through learning from its human counterparts, this time, it is already so many steps ahead of them. Nick Stahl's John Connor gets a few somber moments here and there but the movie never stops to really address the tragedy of the forthcoming nuclear war and why it needs to be stopped. Connor's romantic relationship with Brewster (Danes) is summed up as being \\"fate\\" via the fact that they once played \\"spin the bottle\\" together and the fact that they both happen to cross pathes so early on seems more like the result of lazy story-telling than any type of destiny. In fact, the only reason we know these two are romanticlly-linked is through Arnold telling them so. The comedy is equally weak as most attempts at humor just make the characters seem silly such as Arnold aquiring clothing from a male stripper. This sequel doesn't have any great trend-sending tagline either and instead plays on the old \\"I'll Be Back\\" quote and borrows the dated \\"Talk To The Hand\\" routine.<br />As a beloved fan of the classic Terminator films, I found that director Mostow and writers John Brancato & Michael Ferris had literally no idea what they were doing. As is often the case by the third film in a franchise, the idea of a multi-million dollar profit machine always outweighs the intergrity of the presentation. Schwarzenegger's cyborg spends more time telling us the story than Mostow's direction does, Brad Fidel's legendary \\"Terminator\\" theme is not found in any incarnation, and the ending is so drastically horrible that I felt that they would have been better off, making no sequel at all than trying to make this one. The only thing worse than the ending itself is the opening for yet another Terminator sequel. For shame.ry-telling than any type of destiny.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This was really a fun animation to watch.  It is funny and very clever.   That's why it has so much appeal to all age groups.  Just one suggestion if you buy this: MAKE SURE YOU WATCH IT AT THE END WHEN THE CREDITS START ROLLING....Some of the most clever and funniest bit are during the ending credits so don't consider it finished until the credits are finished....
B00004TJFL|3.0|Not nearly as good as the three previous Michael Myers films but a lot better than the three following, this fifth installment (though &quot;Part III&quot; was unrelated) is truly a mixed bag. While &quot;The Shape&quot; is still the unstoppable killing machine he was in earlier chapters, his newest list of victims are about as obnoxious and goofy as they get.<br />Taking place a year after the last film, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), Michael's only living relative, is now an involent living in a hospital for problem children. Of course, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still around and it's a good thing because the rest of the cast is just awful. Loomis has grown impatient though as he tries to convince Jamie to lead him to Michael. The killing spree starts up again and of course, Jamie and another seperate group of oversexed teenagers are the targets here.<br />HALLOWEEN V has its moments as far as scares are concerned though it does work more at being gory than being scary at times. Some of the movie works well but there are a whole lot of plot holes to be found, this time around. Followed by an even dumber HALLOWEEN: CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is a very clever and very funny story, but as other's have mentioned.....It's not something you'll ever see on the Cartoon Network for kids.  It's hard to say what is actually funnier with South Park.  Is it the straight out bits or the implied humor you have to think about and catch throughout the movie?  In any case it's a fine blend that just makes this extremely non-PC film so damn funny.  There are bits in this that actually had me laugh so hard that I had to pause the movie so I wouldn't have to go back to hear what I was missing....Now that's funny.....So unless you're some prude who hates the thought of cartoon kids using language basically the same way that real human kids of that age would use, then I strongly reccomend checking this out for some damn good fun....
B00005JMCR|2.0|I saw this movie on the opening night and can only say that it was a complete waste of time and money. With half of the cast from the first two movies missing the interesting interplay was largely missing as well. Seann William Scott as \\"Stifler\\" seemed like he was really trying to force it even though he largely plays the same character in every movie. There were some funny moments, but there were also some gross-out moments that were meant to be funny, but didn't work. I just wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I really enjoyed the others.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's often difficult to gauge the importance or the influence a band has on the world of music. Would Robert Johnson have known all those years ago that an ex-upholsterer from Detroit would one day use his special brand of blues to such devastating effect, and in so doing, breathe life into an insipid music world? How the White Stripes are regarded in thirty or forty years time will no doubt provide the answers to their place in the pantheon of time honoured rock - but for now they're without peer.<br />Elephant is the result of the three proceeding albums. It has it all. The raw unbridled rage of the self titled debut in 'Black Math' the Beatle like ballads of De Stilj in 'I want to the boy to warm your mothers heart' and the punk 'n' blues riffs of White Blood Cells in 'Hypnotize' and 'Girl you have no faith in medicine'. It kick starts with a bass line and a statement of intent from Jack as he points the finger of his rage at the gossip and innuendo surrounding his rise to stardom. 'There's no home for you here' comes with backing vocals and a classic Jack White demented rant half way through and then there's the full of Bravado bluesy number 'Ball and Biscuit' clocking in at around eight minutes.<br />Much richer in production but still maintaining that signature raw appeal there's even time for a Burt Bacarach cover and for Meg to take her place at the vocal mic with the spaced out Peggy Lee like 'In the cold cold night'. That's not her only time at the mic stand though, as she, Jack, and guest vocalist Holly Golighty take the piss out of everyone including themselves in the closing track 'It's true that we love one another'. <br />A classic album that will take some doing to be toppled from it's perch this year. Just how we view the White Stripes in years to come is yet to be seen but on this evidence their fire will burn long in the minds of all that are touched by their brilliance.
0780626494|5.0|and I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the foul language wasn't necessary. It provided a stark cultural contrast between Adam, who didn't talk that way, and most of the modern people who did. We also got to see Adam's reaction to it. Unlike most movies that use foul language, the use of such language in this film was used very effectively to allow Adam to stand out from everyone else, and to tell us something about his character. It was used for characterization, and not gratuitously. Overall, it was very funny-which is always a good thing- and as usual, Brenden Fraser is hot!
B000092ZYX|5.0|It is simply impossible to compare Radiohead albums... they are all benchmarks in their own right.<br />It is simply impossible to 'rank' the songs on this album, as with any Radiohead album.<br />They are all excellent for their own reasons, as with any Radiohead album.<br />Once again I find myself in awe of their genius, trying desperately to articulate just what it is about the music that leaves such a lasting impression on me and resonates so deeply, as with any Radiohead album.<br />You might just say it's another Radiohead album. And you might just find that that's all there is to say.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction - If you relax, and take it for what it is, this novel will be an enjoyable, quick read. It has a smoothly flowing, Clancy-esque pulp fiction type of plot that manages to exude an aura of intelligence without getting bogged down in explaining the physics of a cruise missile to uncaring readers. The characters are a stumbling block - The only ones who get their fair share of background explanations are an albino monk named Silas and a codebreaking, gun-toting grandaughter of the Louvres' murdered curator. The rest are mere plot devices, or major characters without a history, let alone a personality. The author's research, though extensive, is flawed at times. To call it research is an insult to historians - He draws most of his information from numerous conspiracy theories relating to the Knights Templar, not a scrap of which has been proven true. One must remember that this is a work of fiction, and, just as it is fun to read about government UFO coverups or the like, it is fun to read this as well. This, however, is not a work of nonfiction, and if you wish to treat it as such, then a good, well-written novel becomes an unoriginal book filled to the brim with far-fetched, recycled conspiracy theories and slanted history.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a masterpiece...period. From the first seconds of &quot;Politik&quot; to the last note of &quot;Amsterdam&quot; it does not fail to impress. It is a rare commodity in today's popular music selections to find an album that stands completely on its own as a whole. Lead singer Chris Martin's voice is mesmerizing and often haunting and the music behind it is so powerful that each song could be an instrumental as well. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants a CD that can be listened to straight through without touching the &quot;skip&quot; button. It's excellent!
B00005JLXE|3.0|and have a 6.1 or 7.1 system then you'll really want to see and hear this film.  I have a THX 7.1 system and even though i thought the film was lacking in all aspects, the sound is out of this world.  I'm not a fan of this kind of film, it was fun to watch but not really worth the money to buy. The extras are kind of a waste of time but the 6.1 is well worth it.
0375422307|5.0|I don't give 5 stars easily.  But I just loved this book too much.  And what's weird is that I don't exactly know why.  <br />Maybe it's because it's funny in an unexpected sort of a way-- so the impact is stronger.  Or perhaps it's because it tells a story that has become &quot;taboo&quot; because of the stupid games our political establishments play.<br />It's also the way it honors the real heroes of the Iranian revolution:  The Communists who never stopped believing in &quot;The Revolution&quot; even when it was so clearly hijacked by the religious right; the women who refused to wear the veil; the lost generation of poor child-soldiers sent to the killing fields of the Iran-Iraq war; and so many others.<br />Some critics have been comparing this to Maus.  I think from an artistic standpoint Maus is clearly superior, but nothing else.  Overall Persepolis is a much more significant accomplishment-- more fluid, more dynamic, more heart-felt. (The last frame still makes me cry.)
1881273156|5.0|I am not going to tell you about the authors writing techniques or anything else, I am going to tell you what this book has done for me.<br />  A friend (male) suggested I read this book some time ago.  Since I dont read relationship books I laughed it off, and continued with my relationship.  By that time I had been in my relationship with a man for 7 years, and though we love eachother we just always seemed to fight. He didnt understand me, and I guess I didnt understand him either.  My boyfriend and I decided to split and I left the country.  One day I was bored and picked up the book, and from page one it made sense.  I read the book in 3 hours, and I couldnt wait to call my (then ex) boyfriend back in the states. I told him about it, and asked him if he would read it.  He said yes, and so I had a copy mailed to him.  He read it, and everything started to come together for him also. A month later he asked me to come home, and I agreed.  I can tell you these last 2 months have been the best time we have spent together in the 8 years we have been together. I wish I had the book a long time ago.  Now I suggest it to everyone I know, and everyone loves it. Do yourself a favor and buy this book, it might just change your life too.
B00008JLKL|5.0|I will admit at first I did not care for some of their songs but after listening to it a few times it grew on me. I love the relaxing sounds of their voice and how everything flows perfectly. <BR>The Mass has two songs from the previous album, so in reality there is only 8 songs. Either way, the album is great!<BR>Cant wait until the next one.<BR>Biggest fan,<BR>Joe.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has certainly changed since her teen pop days- and for the better! Every single song on this CD is awesome! Your missingout if you don't have this CD.<br />1.Stripped Intro - God intro letting eveyrone know who Christina is now and kinda tells you this CD is very personal and deep.<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down - very good and very true song! It's for the women and standards set for women.<br />3.Walk Away- I love this song! One of my faves. Excellent music and she really uses her voice. It's obvious she really felt what the song talks about.<br />4.Fighter - fast-beat rock type song. Which is kind of like the next \\"chapter\\" to Walk Away.<br />5.Primer Amor Interlude - talking in spanish to a guitar.<br />6.Infatuation - great song with a latin sound.<br />7.Love's Embrace Interlude- nicely done continuing into Loving Me For Me...<br />8. Loving Me For Me- One of muh faves. Slow beat song with a soothing type vocals.<br />9.Impossible - If you love Alicia Keys and Christina then you'll one this track. They do such a nice job on this song. <br />10.Underappreciated - R&Bish type song... I can understand where she's coming from.<br />11.Beautiful - Song about just loving you for who you are. I lvoe this song!<br />12. Make Over - energetic rock song showing Christina can do lots with her voice.<br />13.Cruz - I love this one! Talks about leaving everything from before behind and heading into a new life.<br />14.Soar - Excellent song with good message.<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours - good song about casual sex. And it's pretty true. <br />16. Dirrty - awesome party song! First single form Stripped. Very good with a great beat! <br />17.Stripped Pt. 2- like the first one, telling mroe about herself and saying she is not a virgin, but not a slut. <br />18.The Voice Within - very good ballad which I love. Message about trusting yourself no matter what everyone else says.<br />19. Im O.K.- A sad song about Christina's childhood with an abusive father. You can feel thepain in this track.<br />20.Keep On Singin' My Song- Christina sings beautifully to this great closing song for \\"Stripped\\".<br />If you don't have this already, GET IT! :D
B00005JMCR|4.0|Hey, while it might be full of [toilet] humor many people might find offensive, AMERICAN WEDDING is just hilarious.  I don't think I stopped laughing throughout the whole thing.  Many of the film's jokes build on humorous moments from the two AMERICAN PIE movies, but that's okay.  There's loads of fun in this installment surrounding the impending wedding of the nymphomaniac \\"Band Camp\\" girl, Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), and the friend-to-home-baked-goods ne'er-do-well, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs).  The movie isn't so much about Jim and Michelle, though.  Seann William Scott steals the show (again?) as wild party boy Stifler, and Hannigan's character ends up being little more than a prop.  Still, the film has a heart, and there are a few touching moments (even though they might make some folk cringe a bit ;).<br />One hilarious moment is when Stifler accidently wanders into a gay bar and sets out to prove that he's appealing even to gay men by showcasing his dance moves to a collage of 80s dance tracks!  Another great scene senters around the mis-aptly scheduled \\"bachelor party.\\"  Once again, the AMERICAN WEDDING franchise proves that it is the modern leader in sexual/toilet humor, but manages to tell a story in such a way as the humor appears simply part of life (well, isn't it, then?)  There's more laughs to go around than you can shake a stick at!
6305232660|5.0|Deep Impact is a compelling story of 4 people, Jenny Lerner, a low-rate reporter for MSNBC (Tea Leoni), Leo Biederman, an average teenager who discovers the comet (Elijah Wood),  President Tom Beck of the United States (Morgan Freeman), and  Spurgen Tanner, the last Astronaut who walked on the moon, who, with a team of young astronauts, has been sent to stop the comet (Robert Duvall). The story of these four develop quite nicely, as it starts out with Leo in astronomy club, and when his teacher asks what an object is in the sky, he does not know. This of course, is the comet. It is sent to a lab, where it is found. From then the story shifts gears to Jenny, and remains with her until the president tells the world of the event. From then it is to Spurgen Tanner, and in some brief glimpses throughout the movie, President Tom Beck. The ideas and progression of the story is amazing. The directing is superb. The action is wonderfully done. It is a must see movie.
B00005T5YK|3.0|Hotel California needs no introduction from me. If you are reading this, then you know what an incredible album this is. I won't repeat the praises of the first couple of reviews, which righteously point out the stellar production and pristine sound of this 5.1 surround mix. The sound of this recording is truly faultless, insofar as I can vouch with my layman's ear and knowledge of recording science. I nearly wept when I heard the rendition of \\"New Kid in Town\\" presented on this disc, it is so perfect and life-like.<br />If I can find any fault with this package (and I didn't have to search for it) it is with the sad visual presentation, which makes this an awkward orphan amongst the ranks of the bold and beautiful DVD audio discs currently on the market (they do call this music format DVD-A for a reason). Were it not for the inherent necessity of the visual menu, which all DVD-A's use to guide the listener along, there would be almost no reason to turn on your television with this particular disc. Beyond the interview with Bill Szymczyk (which is very interesting, although it sounds as if it were recorded in a diving bell), there is nothing at all worth looking at. Unlike many other DVD-A's, this one doesn't bother to offer band photos or lyrics, other than the tried-and-true lyrics to the title song (which most people know by heart and which appear on the similarly lame liner notes). In fact, the artist in charge of visual design chose to use grainy blow-ups of various sectors of the album cover to headline each track, rather than delve into the wealth of band photos that must exist out there. <br />So buy this disc, as I know of no other rendition that even comes close to it. But do yourself a favor, and turn the TV off: you'll waste less electricity, and you'll enjoy the album as it's meant to be enjoyed - without any worthless distractions!
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is a good memory card, it saves all your stuff.<br />I give it 5 stars.
B000002JSP|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin's most maligned album, most of said malign coming from ultra-orthodox rock fans who can't stand musical diversity. Because unlike their previous, guitar-riff based albums this one features John Paul Jones on keyboards in the lead role, with Jimmy Page playing along beside him instead of in front of him (for once).<BR>Since Page was pretty whacked out on heroin during the making, his guitar playing skills do leave something lacking especially compared to his best work on songs like Achilles Last Stand or Black Dog.<BR>However, the use of keyboards on the songs gives them a very different and unique feel.<br />In The Evening: A song with a standard rock sound and standard blues lyrics, the huge, slamming riff makes a great opener. Too bad you can't understand any of the lyrics except 'oh oh I need your love'.<br />South Bound Saurez (sic): An interesting little piece featuring Jones' piano, but not an especially classic piece. You can't understand any of the lyrics, though.<br />Fool in the Rain: A mellow, happy little riff about a slightly less happy subject; a guy waiting for his date and imagining he's been stood up, when actually he's waiting in the wrong place (whoops). Very enjoyable and spiced up by the fast little jam section in the middle.<br />Hot Dog: wierdness. A mock-country song that demonstrates their sense of humour if not much else.<br />Carouselambra: Whoa, they really opened the floodgates now. The first part contains keyboards, drums, bass and vocals but no guitar. The second bit has Page plucking out fuzzy little arpeggios while Robert Plant occasionally belts out something, and then it returns to a full synthesized speed-fest. You can't understand any of the lyrics (starting to notice a pattern?) which is a shame because they can almost compete with Bob Dylan in terms of inscrutable mysticism. Great, underrated song.<br />All My Love: Another synth-heavy one. It's the most sincere song on the album, dedicated to Robert Plant's son (not daughter as a lot of people think for some reason) who died in '77. Nice melody and cool solo.<br />I'm Gonna Crawl: A cool bluesy ending to the album, it might seem a bit repetetive at first until they start to mix things up. <br />All in all...well, if you're a really over-the-top fan like me you'd buy it even if it was crap. It isn't. It's as good as any of their other albums, just very different, and musical diversity is what made the band so great. So head out to your closest locally-owned, non-chain music store and get this album!
0808514121|5.0|This is a novel that successfuly weaves strands of fact with threads of fiction to create a stunning tapestry of American life that is timeless.  The novel is based in the early part of the 1900's and despite it's massive length (over 600 pages) Steinbeck manages to draw you in and make you think.  His characters are richly drawn so that you almost know them.  I believe this is because we can find a little of each character with in ourselves.  This book is the very best book I have ever read and that says a lot because I am constantly reading. Pick up East of Eden today and take the journey to the Salinas Valley. You will not regret it!
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice demonstrates such a range of voices and styles that to put him in a single category would invariably leave something out. Rice relies on the power of understatement to convey strong emotion (often heartbreak). &quot;Delicate,&quot; &quot;The Blower's Daughter,&quot; &quot;Cannonball,&quot; and &quot;Cold Water&quot; are perfect examples of deceptively simple, but never ordinary, lyrics and acoustic instrumentation. &quot;Older Chests&quot; would almost fall into this group as well, except the subtlety is lost and the song becomes too melodramatic. However, this is an exception.<br />&quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Cheers Darlin'&quot; have a moody, slightly jazzy feel; &quot;I Remember&quot; evolves into a harder, rock feel; &quot;Amie&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; use sweeping, orchestral instrumentation (even a bit of Finnish opera in Eskimo.) By the way, &quot;Eskimo&quot; is not actually a 16-minute song; two extra songs are added onto this track, with a few minutes of dead space in between. These two songs, an untitled I'll call &quot;All Dressed Up For&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;, would be better split into separate tracks, but that's a minor flaw.<br />There really aren't any songs in O that I don't enjoy, but if I had to pick, my favorites would be &quot;The Blower's Daughter,&quot; &quot;Delicate&quot; and &quot;Amie,&quot; which all best demonstrate Rice's lyric tenderness and emotionally expansive voice. This album has immediately become one of my favorites, and is worth every minute of listening.
079213690X|5.0|Usually people say that they don't want to be taught anything when they go to movies, they want to be entertained.  Hence it's surprising how many reviews focus on the historical inaccuracies of this movie.<br /><br />Braveheart is not a documentary and does not puport to be one.  It is a movie, and its methods are whatever will suit its own unique purpose, which is evidently to fulfill a vision of a roughly ideal individual.  And in this purpose it spectacularly succeeds.  It is, as the title Braveheart implies, the story of a superb example of a man, who lusts for life, who cherishes his values and fights to defend them, and who maintains his integrity even unto the last.  When the sun rises and the black-hearted retreat from its glare, it is the men of this kind of stature who remain, free to bask in the warmth of its rays.
B00005JM09|4.0|This was an amazing film. I was scared that it was going to suck much like most movies coming out now, but it was great. They gave a very resonable explination why the end of the world didn't come yet, but it still needs to be prevented. Great acting all around, and John Conor still gives the impression of an unlikly hero. No Sara Conor though, too bad. You get to see the early modles of all the machians. In the fight sceans every thing got destroyed (even once a huge truck, which was probally the coolest scean in the movie). If you are a Termenator fan, you will not be disappointed.
B000002H6C|5.0|I purchased this disc on my school trip to Montreal three and a half months ago, and I was blown away. It is the heaviest and fastest album they have done, which is odd, since Jason Newsted screwed them up totally after Black, and this was his first studio album with them. And now, onto the tunes:<br />1. Blackened<BR>A thrashin' good opener. A<br />2. ...And Justice For All<BR>An epic. 9 minutes and 44 seconds of thrash heaven! A+<br />3. Eye Of The Beholder<BR>A little slow, stays the same tempo throughout, but still heavy. B<br />4. One <BR>Their first music video. And wow! Even people who diss this disc say that this song saves it from total lameness. What a pit favorite! Amazing solo! A+++<br />5. The Shortest Straw<BR>A fast tune that stays the same throughout. Rockin' fun, but at a good glance, this could be a song that an extremely angry country singer could do (not to diss the kings of thrash in any way!). B+<br />6. Harvester Of Sorrow<BR>Love the bass! Catchy chorus, too. A-<br />7. Frayed Ends Of Sanity<BR>Love the Wizard Of Oz intro! Even so, this is the weakest lick on the album. B-<br />8. To Live Is To Die<BR>An epic acoustic/electric instrumental, clocking in at nearly 10 minutes! As the acoustic ending section fades... A+<br />9. Dyers Eve<BR>This thrashin' closer blasts in! A+<br />Ride The Lightning is their best, but this comes in a close second. If you're looking for the heaviest Metallica possible, this is for you.
0142004235|5.0|I have no earthly notion why Oprah selected a Steinbeck work of this magnitude and scope to resurrect her book club. However, maybe without Oprah's generous promotional efforts, this particular work by John Steinbeck (1902-68) might have remained the obscure and enigmatic masterpiece that it is. Keen movie buffs will recall the attempt some thirty-odd years ago (or more?) to convert this novel into a movie [executed appropriately in funereal black and white, instead of in dazzling color ... despite the sunny brilliance of California's Salinas Valley]. The brooding actor James Dean had the role of brother Caleb, who vies for the affection and approval of his father, played imperially by Anthony Quinn. The movie version was not at all a box-office success mainly because, in my view, the story was so amazingly intricate and overwhelming with its ponderously convoluted psychological elements. The same is true with the novel: multi-layered in approach, tone, and structure, resulting in constant nervous tension and anguish. But then who would dare argue with a giant of such innovative literary artistry as Nobel Prize (1962) winning writer John Steinbeck? At some point shortly after the initial publication of this novel (1952) Steinbeck himself alluded to the \\"difficulty\\" (e.i.,complexity) of this powerfully dramatic work. He was extremely pleased. And difficult it most certainly is. I know I'm dating myself, but so what? Does anyone remember those essential Cliff Notes that regularly accompanied literary Master Works? Well, there was one for EAST OF EDEN. Believe me, this handy little yellow booklet proved indispensable to many readers 'back in the day.' A Masterful Read!
0689859368|3.0|When I first picked up the book, my first thought was that it resembled the wonderful Series of Unfortunate Events.  I decided to try it anyway, though it looked like a pale imiation of Lemony Snicket.<br />In the first book of the series, three siblings left with a single mother arrive at their new home: a battered mansion belonging to an old \\"mad\\" aunt.  Inside, they discover something moving in the walls and creating havoc within the house.  With a secret room and a special book, the children find themselves gazing into the world of Faeries.<br />The plot is interesting and the characters have potential, but the length of the book left little room to expand either.  Altogether, a fun yet disappointing read; It leaves you wanting more but not giving it.  This book is less entertaining than the Series of Unfortunate Events, but it IS more appropriate than the former for younger children.

B000002J03|3.0|I listened to all the Zeppelin albums in succession, starting with [I] and ending with Coda.  This one held its ground until Houses of the Holy.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad album, but not their best.<br />So, here are the songs, each reviewed individually (score is out of 10):<br />Whole Lotta Love-9<BR>What Is And What Should Never Be-8<BR>The Lemon Song-8<BR>Thank You-9<BR>Heartbreaker-10<BR>Living Loving Maid-9<BR>Ramble On-5<BR>Moby Dick-6 (Just because the song is boring.

B00005AQE8|3.0|The cd was too damn long, it would've been better if it was a 1 dics album instead of 2. And i HATE the outlaws, they are just horrible. Almost every other song features one them loosers on there. That brings the cd down a couple of points. If you want to perfect example of a flawless double dicsc album, get Life after death, by the best rapper, B.I.G. Someother classics instead Ready to die and illamtic. Pac was poet he wasn't a rapper, Big was the rapper. Pac was the embodiement of a thug or a gangsta but in reality hes a wannabe, a back-up dancer for digital underground. Pac is who people wanted a thug to be like, but in reality Big was the true hustler/rapper/whatever, a big fat guy, who is now considered the best rapper ever.
B000065U1N|4.0|I'm not a fan of war movies, in fact, I usually can't stand them, but this one was good.  The mood is just as it should be, somber but not too sad, and the filming is excellent.  The movie is mostly in earthy camouflage colors, greens and yellows and browns.  The stunts and special effects are all realistic.  The soundtrack is also very fitting, sounding very eerie in the sad parts.  The acting is all superb, even that of minor characters.  The sense of camaraderie between soldiers is portrayed well.<br />This movie is too gory for children to watch, or those who dislike seeing gore or violence, but I enjoyed it, so I would recommend it even for those, like me, who don't normally like war movies.  I don't really know how it compares to other war films since I haven't seen many, but it is a good movie and my guess is that it ranks on up there.
0316666343|5.0|I would some times wonder what it would be like to have read 'Huck Fin' or anything by Shakespeare or Hemingway when the writings were new, or what it would have been like to listen to a Stones or Beatles song, and they were yet to be hailed as classics......well, now I know.  <br />As I read The Lovely Bones, I couldn't help but feel very 'Lucky'.  Sorry....but seriously....<br />This is an amazing book that promises you a story about a girl's point of view from beyond the grave and delivers a complete view point on a young girl's world.  Try to remember how it felt when you were a teen ager and your neighborhood and every one in it was the 'entire world'.  This book captures the world view of some one who is not complete, and will never get the chance to grow old.  A true gift.  I still don't know how the author pulled this off.  Hats off! <br />PS-Start reading this book on a weekend, or when you have a couple days off,  or you will be fired, because you will call out from work, you will skip eating, and you will push everything aside until you are done with this book.  I called out sick.  Put a day or two aside and start reading!
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is Iron Maiden's finest hour in the same sense that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was Black Sabbath's finest hour.  Grandiose and musical, this album is a stepping stone in heavy metal.  Then-new drummer Nicko McBrain kickstarts the down-and-dirty opener &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, establishing the band at their tightest.  The mystical &quot;Revelations&quot; follows.  The Bruce Dickinson penned song is a haunting classic showcasing Adrians Smith and Dave Murray's abilities to harmonize their guitars together.  &quot;Flight Of Icarus&quot; is one of those truly great epics that make learning fun.  &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; and &quot;The Trooper&quot; are both fast paced, energetic rockers that leave you begging for more.  Bassist Steve Harris demonstrates his expert songwriting skills here.  &quot;Still Life&quot; is yet another grandiose number.  But the guitar part is incredibly complex yet just as amazing.  &quot;Quest For Fire&quot; is another fun history lesson about the discovery of man. Bruce Dickinson's voice soars here.  &quot;Sun And Steel&quot; is another down-and-dirty rocker that just rips your head off.  &quot;To Tame A Land&quot;, Harris' Dune inspired epic, is the one song appropriate enough to end and album of such musical proportions.  It starts off slow.  But it builds up to a climax of Murray and Smith dualing it out before joining for one last amazing harmony section, before ending it with the intro.  What an album, Maiden's finest hour.
0312983867|5.0|I never read any Stephanie Plum books, so I saw one and picked me up. Let me tell you I wasn't dissapointed, I read it right away, and I was very pleased with the book.  It's a mystery book, but also has some laughs and funny descriptions and dialouge.  I recommend this book, for a nice mystery with humor.
B000069AUI|5.0|A collaboration of a single thought or feeling expressed by Chris Martin in almost if you will a display of events and inner being through the lyrics and melodies of this album. This band has outdone itself with this album. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy each and every track. Hearing Clocks on the radio is what lead me to listen to more of the album and in doing so I feel that any one of the songs on this album could be played on the radio and become a hit. Chris really shows the magnitude of his voice and variations in pitch which really connect with the lyrics and words he is using. Don't wait to purchase this album, you won't be able to stop listening and continue enjoying it over and over again.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I got this CD on its release and is still one of my favorite CD's. The Welcome is bland but the rest of the CD is worth the money. I suggest if you like Pretty Fly and Why Don't You Get A Job that you might want to buy the CD. Personally I think of them as the worst songs on the CD other than Feelings. Instead of Welcome at the beginning, I would have put Pay the Man because it sounds like a tune to open a concert. It is not a bad song if you look at it that way. The rest of the CD is just awesome. I recommend it extremely.
0790729342|5.0|This flick rocks.  Twenty years later and counting THE ROAD WARRIOR is still at the top of my list for best action films of all time.  I have yet to see in modern Hollywood a dude do a multiple spine-snapping flip sommersault like the mohawk sporting thug in this movie does.  Amazing.  The thirty minute truck chase at the end still raises my blood pressure to imeasuable heights.  MEL as MAX is awesome, especially when he hammers the skull of a looting punk with a gigantic pair of bolt cutters without batting an eyelash.  You know what I'm talking about.  The unbridaled carnage that ensues in this film would be on the cutting room floor in this day and age.  The kind of film you can literaly watch anytime for the thousanth time and still have to pause the DVD so you can go to the fridge to get more red meat.  Great disc, it's nice to see this film in widescreen format and with cool sound.  If you collect DVDs and you don't own THE ROAD WARRIOR then you are a sixty-three year old woman.
B000065V41|1.0|This movie is a classic.  A cherished Christmas tradition at my house.  You can always rely on the Muppets for some entertainment, but this is one of the best.  Now, you would think such a classic would get decent DVD treatment, right?  Wrong.  Disney has decided to release this movie edited.  That's right -- 25% of the picture is cut off from the sides to fit a standard television.  If only the correct Widescreen version had been offered.  Forget about black bars -- with widescreen, you can see a movie the way it was meant to be seen!
B00008IHN1|5.0|Drumline is the hit of the year!!! Nick Cannon plays an awesome character (Devon Miles)!!! Its such  good mvie and i recommend it to everyone! GOOD JOB NICK!!! :)
B000002UAC|5.0|Its a natural misconception to think that each album through Sgt.Pepper was better than the one before it. That thinking assumes that progress in songwriting technique could overcome the fatigue that comes with 3 years of nearly constant touring and songwriting. Paul and John had worked together almost as many years before they made this album as they would work together after it. In fact these guys were ready for their first major label release. Here they offered some of their best songs and all the energy, excitement and positive vibes that Beatlemania would eventually come perilously close to [draining] dry.<BR> These songs were written before songwriting became a job for these guys. And before it was a sure thing that every record they made would sell big. The choice of selling the UK versions of their early records is usually a good thing. But here, the US version - \\"Meet the Beatles\\" would have made a far superior CD. \\"With the Beatles\\" has 5 covers, most of which have aged badly. \\"Meet the Beatles\\" included 3 hits not on \\"With...\\",'I Want to Hold Your Hand,''I Saw Her Standing There' and 'This Boy.' No contest. Not until \\"Revolver\\" would they again sustain this high level throughout an album.<BR> They would go on to write more musically sophisticated, socially relevant, and mind expanding songs. But they never wrote better songs than these. If you want to hear the Beatles rock, this is the album.
B000099T2L|5.0|This Cd is fantastic! I Love it. Miss.Knowles sings beutiful, soulful and sensual musics that young ladies will be able to relate to. My favorite songs are &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; (whith Jay-Z) and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;. This CD has everything from rap to soul. Beyonce does great duets with Big Boi (from OutKast), Sean Paul, Missy Elliot and Jay-Z. If you like Destiny's Child you'll love Dangerously In Love. Beyonce obviously has a great singing talent and a beautful, soulful, powerful and angelic voice. This CD is HOT! Soulful! UPBEAT! and Rockin. Beyonce sings her heart out in her wounderful new debout ambum Dangerously in Love. Also check out her new music video, Crazy In Love it made it up to Number 2 in the VH1 countdown. I Love this Cd I can't wait for Beyonce's next album.
B00005JMCR|4.0|If you're a fan of American Pie 1 and 2 you will not be disappointed with this third installment. Although, a good portion of the original cast is absent here, [namely, Chris Klein (Oz), Tara Reid (Vicky), Mena Suvari (Heather) and Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia)] the story is a fitting conclusion to a very funny trilogy.<br />As was the case in 1 & 2, American Wedding is mostly about [human relations]. In part 3 we deal with ... some very graphic scatological humor. And don't forget Stifler's mom!<br />Seann William Scott reprises his role as Steve Stifler -- the guy you just love to hate and hate to love. Although, in this installment, Stifler seems to be more of a parody of himself. More \\"stupid funny\\" than the straight forward, in your face Stifler of the previous films. <br />The gags in American Wedding are right on. Jim stumbles from one embarrassing episode to another. All the while, Jim's Dad (the brilliant Eugene Levy) is right there with him, lecturing Jim on the lessons of life and love. <br />Interestingly, I saw this movie in the theatre. An elderly couple who were seated in front of my wife and I, walked out after only a half an hour. Indeed, Stifler's profanity and the film's lewd [relationships] comes at you full force. Perhaps it was just a little too much for that particular couple. They were probably expecting something else from a movie called \\"American Wedding\\".<br />Again, I would have liked to have seen more of the original cast members in this film (Oz isn't even mentioned). Despite that fact, this is still a very good movie which will have you laughing out loud.
1400034779|1.0|This book was very slow moving and lacked the ability to hold my interest.  I'd recommend the Poisonwood Bible instead.
B00006CXXU|5.0|CA has completely proven her unparalleled talent. I am a huge fan of music in general & I am addicted to all genres including rock, pop, r&b, classic rock, easy listening, jazz, instrumental, classical, contemporary country....whatever my mood is. I must say that \\"Stripped\\" is my absolute favorite out of all my 100's of CD's. I always liked CA because of her Angelic voice, but never considered myself a huge fan until now. CA's songwriting & producing on this album showcases her true talent and sets her far apart from her pop counterparts. This is a suffisticated and mature compilation of authentic music. Every track on this CD is phenominal. The incredible captivating & emotional lyrics, the musical diversity, the overall prduction, & her mesmerizing & Heavenly voice is truly amazing in this Stripped musical masterpiece. I buy CD's all the time & no other CD has had the ability to capture my interest as this one. I mean even almost a year after its release I am still listening to it w/ complete astonishment. This CD isn't that repetative same ole same ole that you get from so many artists out there.  CA is so musically diverse.  This should be an \\"Ultimite Album\\" on VH1. Oh, & if this album isn't at least nominated for \\"Album Of The Year\\" or multiple categories on the AMA's or GRAMMY's than something is truly wrong. This album has the ability to capture the interest of people in all age groups. I just hope we don't have to wait so long for her next official studio album. Of course, Stripped is so good that its staying power is permanent & will get us through our withdraw until her next album is released. Oh, I also respect the fact that Christina involves herself in all the writing and producing of her music. I think Mariah & Christina are the only two female vocal songstresses that write their own music & MC has written her own music from the very beginning of her career. I have much more respect for an artist who has this capability. When you here there music it has more credibility because it comes straight from the artist themselves. All other artists known for their phenominal voices do not write or produce the music they sing. They may lend a hand here & there w/ producing, but overall they are not involved in creating what they sing & I will never understand it. This is why I have so much more respect for Mariah & now Christina because they are true musical artists. When they refer to their music as \\"My Music\\", what they say is true - its their music, & its personal. They may not be instrumental perfectionists, but alot of artists who play intruments can't sing. Mariah & Christina have their voices that are there instruments & boy can they play them. If you do not have Stripped please go get it. I highly recommend it.
B000002RXS|5.0|Callas is the total TEA in this recording.  She IS Carmen!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the lightning is one of the best thrash metal albums of all time.But I still don't know which is better, Ride the lightning, or master of puppets....... anyway, the tempo for this album is very very fast.But there is a song called ''fade to black'' which takes a break from the high speed thrash.Fade To Black is probably the best song on the album.Even though its not high speed thrash, its still a classic ''tallica'' song.Notice how i said the words high speed thrash more than once, because thats what makes Ride the lightning!!! Actually, my favorite tallica album is ...and justice for all.But this is still a classic.
B000002L82|5.0|Unfortunately, New Order peaked at the beginning of their career. Forever haunted by the superior Joy Division releases, they still managed to produce some great records (and most importantly some great 12\\") early on. \\"Power, Corruption & Lies\\" is easily their best and most consistent effort, with tracks like \\"Age of Consent\\", \\"Your Silent Face\\" and (my personal favourite) \\"Leave Me Alone\\" standing out on an album most noted for its coherency. The production is great and especially Peter Hook's bass work is outstanding.<br />If at all possible, get your hands on a release that *doesn't* contain \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"The Beach\\". Good tracks in and of themselves, they really break up this album. There is a reason that they were left out in the first place, and it's sad to see that those reasons are disrespected. The album is far superior without them.<br />20 years later and still New Order are releasing decent music, but they never again sounded as good as on \\"P, C & L\\".
B000003TAR|5.0|To understand this album and appreciate, you must understand what Kurt Cobain was all about. He never wanted to be a rock star, but he started making albums and signed to a label to makemoney that would make it possible to live a decent life. Bleach, Nirvanas only true &quot;metal album&quot;, featured Chad Channing on Drums, one of the best drummers ever who could create a double bass drum sound with out a double bass pedal. Thats incredible. With the introduction of Dave Grohl on drums, The band mellowed out. With this came their true following, a bunch of angst ridden teens who ate Nevermind up in order to maintain coolness and an avant garde sense of being in the know. This made Kurt a star, something he never wanted to be. That all being said, In Utero is a direct slap in theface to that audience who loved nevermind. Kurtbegan to believe his music was attracting the wrong audience so he tweaked his song writing style to a point where You have a song like Tourettes, a minute and a half of screaming and pure loud smashing guitar and drums. If you lsten to NEvermind and Then In Utero, its almost like two different bands. Kurt Cobain, in short, MADE LOUDER HEAVIER SONGS AND EXTREMELY DUMBED DOWN PRODUCTION VALUE TO PRODUCE A LOUD GRAINY ALBUM NOT AKIN TO CURRENT MAINSTREAM RADIO. Thats not to say tht if you like Nevermind you wont like In Utero, they are just different, thats all. Nevermind has a commercial poppy sound and In Utero has a fast crunching metal sound. Not to say that there aren't &quot;Hits&quot; on In Utero, it still contains The mellow songs like Heart Shaped Box and All Apologies, but they have an intensity that is missing on Nevermind. This is Nirvanas best album, and also contains my personal favorite song ever- Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, evn the title depicts how Kurt feels. Any fan of music should own this cd an give credit where credit is due to one of the most brilliant songwriters of our generation.
0060536357|5.0|Inside the high stakes world of high finance, this book superbly portrays the happenings the events that led to the rise and eventual fall of two great American companies, RJR and Nabisco. Along the way, these companies inturn merger with other companies resulting in the cash spinning behemoth that became the prey of many corp finance predators of Wall St. <br />Both the authors excel at investgative journalism, wherein lies the beauty of this book. What you get from this book is a lucidly writen cases on a multitude of things. The making of the brand RJR Nabisco, from the turn of 20th to 21st century. The rise of the unstoppable buyout machine, KKR, the rise and fall of the leverage buyout (LBO) industry and the rise and fall of one man who spearheaded most of the fall of RJR Nabisco, Ross F Johnson. You end up learning more about many things that you thought were possible and the best part is, the narration style. Its like watching a good Hollywood movie, a fast paced thriller. So once you start the book you never want to put it down. And when you finish reading, you are left with a feeling of wanting more.
0385504209|1.0|Started very interesting, has too many boring, dull, ridiculous details that go on and on unnecessarily. Has a good ending, but the middle was so full of bull, I didn't think it would ever end.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced, exciting thriller that will hold your interest from the opening pages to the final page. Brown, in his latest thriller, starts you off with a vicious murder in the Louvre and takes you on a search for the Holy Grail. What makes The Da Vinci Code several levels above the average thriller is Brown's ability to use the impeccable research he did to provide a fascinating interpretation of Western history and to describe historical events that are as interesting as the suspenseful murder investigation itself. I think that if you can put aside whatever your strong personal beliefs are about &quot;the Truth&quot; and not take the book too seriously, you'll consider The Da Vinci Code to be among the most interesting and entertaining novels you've read in a long time. The one flaw in this book for me -- and it's a very minor one -- is that Brown could have been more descriptive about the physical appearances of the hero and heroine to enable you to have good picture in your mind about what they looked like. I highly recommend The Da Vinci Code to you. Enjoy!
B000002LRX|5.0|everyone loves this one, if you don't have it your CD collection is shameful.
0790729725|5.0|Of all of the \\"mob\\" movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, \\"Goodfellas\\" most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the \\"definitive\\" mobster movies.  Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling \\"based on a true story\\" nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.<br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is a powerful film based on the true life best seller \\"Wiseguy\\" by Nicholas Pileggi.   More specifically, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liota), who along with his pals Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film.  Needless to say, the performances by these actors, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are nothing short of superb.<br />The premise:<br />Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, \\"Goodfellas\\" tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them.  After all, how could anybody resist a life in which if you're part of the \\"organization,\\" there is nothing that you cannot have and you have the fearful respect of everybody around you, as long as you're continuing to make money and not stepping on any of the important people's toes.<br />As the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.<br />From the opening frame to the final credits, \\"Goodfellas\\" is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies.  Fair warning though, this movie \\"is not\\" for the faint of heart or the squeamish, for it is fairly graphic at times, which serves to enhance the nature of this film but is not too good on the eyes.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />This DVD was released in 1997 as one of the early transfers, therefore it's not loaded down with an exceptional amount of special features, which is fine because it's all about the film.  I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re-released as a \\"Special Edition\\" with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.<br />What is does have:<br />- A remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1<BR>- Production notes<BR>- Two theatrical trailers

0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith's White Teeth was a pleasure to read, yet the novel left something to be desired - especially the inadequate resolution. Smith's impeccable wit is apparent from the first page of the novel, transforming what would normally be a grim attempted suicide into a comical, ill-fated endeavor. It is in such a manner that Smith brings up numerous thought provoking issues ranging from race, to war, to religion, her clever style making such issues seem so extraneous to real life while at the same time subtly disclosing the fact that understanding them and coping with them is essential. Smith pulls this off while moving the novel along at an extremely brisk pace - but this unfortunately works against her at some points. She waits until the middle of the novel to introduce entirely new, yet extremely important characters. Their link to anything preceding their entrance is weak, and the change in focus is too abrupt, bringing the pace of the novel to a sudden halt. It takes Smith some time to rebuild confidence in the novel, at which point the pace picks back up. Unfortunately, the end of the book arrives very quickly at such an instance, and after Smith had put a lot of work into building suspense, the climax was painfully unsatisfying and left me unhappy. Smith's characters are mostly well developed, but just like the brisk pace, this does damage to the novel at certain points. The more thoroughly developed characters shine in comparison with those that lack such depth. Hence, when Smith focuses on one of these flatter characters, the book becomes more of a chore to read than when the writing is centered on any of the more interesting characters. Essentially, Smith's problem is her inconsistent writing quality. There is so much excellent writing to be found in this book, but Smith fails to maintain her exceptional prose evenly throughout. As a result, it was difficult to enjoy White Teeth as I would have liked. The further development of certain characters coupled with a more satisfying resolution would have earned this book a higher score, but Smith's wit combined with the way in which she introduces and explores important issues make White Teeth well worth reading.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I first saw the previews it turned me away.  I thought it was just going to be another dumb little kid movie.  But as they say: Don't judge a book (or movie) by it's cover.  it turned out to be one of my favorite movies.  It is about a grumpy, lonely ogre that sets out to bring a princess back for a short lord who has a big ego.  But he has to deal with a talking donkey that can never be quiet and a princess with a dark secret.  Somewhere along the line somegthing happens that nobody expected.  The princess and ogre fall in love with eachother but don't admit.  Before they know it the princess is preparing to marry lor Farquad and Shrek is making his way back to his swamp.  Will true love ever prevail?
B00005JMCR|4.0|I saw the movie the day it came out.  well, I am sorry to see that all the characters did not participate--but then it does not matter.  it just gives the writers less to worry about and then they can focus on some of the more interesting characters.  that being said, the movie is right on par with the others----it has a heart and meaning, grossout humor, nudity and downright funny situations.  sometimes less can be more and this is one of those times.  go see the movie and sit back and laugh your a$$ off.  it will be money well spent.  what more do you want from a movie with its kind of track record.
B00005JK8K|2.0|There's been such a surfeit of war pictures coming out of Hollywood in the past few years that it's small wonder \\"Windtalkers\\" failed to ignite many box office sparks when it was released in the summer of 2002.  Famed action director John Woo has served himself well by mounting spectacularly effective and brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes, but the writers, John Rice and Joe Bateer, have let him down big time in the story department.  Woo has flooded the screen with moments of uncompromising graphic realism, only to have them mitigated by trite dialogue, predictable ironies and corny melodramatics.  Both the director and the men who actually lived through the events of this true-life story deserve better.<br />\\"Windtalkers\\" does have history going for it.  In World War II, the Allied Forces in the Pacific needed to come up with a brand new code that would be \\"uncrackable\\" by the Japanese.  The military decided that it would base that code on the Navajo language, thus precipitating the need to recruit young Navajo men to come to the battlefields as \\"code-talkers.\\"  The film focuses on one such man, Ben Yahzee, and the officer, Joe Enders, whose sole duty it becomes to protect Ben in battle and keep him out of the hands of the Japanese.  Joe, naturally, balks at the idea of having to perform \\"babysitting\\" duty on the front line, and he is not afraid to show Ben just how he feels about the situation in the early stages of their relationship.  Joe has other problems as well.  Recently injured in battle himself, he also struggles with the guilt accrued from having led all the men of his previous platoon to their deaths while \\"following orders like a good Marine.\\"<br />There is certainly plenty in terms of character and conflict for the screenwriters to work with here, yet somehow they never find a way to bring those characters or conflicts to convincing life.  Joe's initial reluctance to accept Ben is as predictable as his inevitable change of heart at the end.  And \\"predictable\\" is really the key word here in describing much of this film.  Are we really surprised when the most vocal racist in the group - who says \\"Injuns\\" aren't much different from the Japanese they're all fighting - has his life saved by the very man who's been the target of all his ridicule?  And don't we just know that a soldier will be gunned down the moment he offers a piece of chocolate to a distraught little Japanese girl?  Or how about the fact that the two men, one white, one Navajo, who have been literally making beautiful music together - one on the flute and the other on the harmonica - demonstrating colorblind brotherhood in action, are cut down right next to one another in the same battle?  Thus, the unsettling, cluttered \\"messiness\\" of the battle scenes is undercut by the too carefully contrived nature of so much of the actual narrative.  By trying so hard to move and uplift us, the film feels manipulative and calculated when it needs to feel most sincere.<br />\\"Windtalkers\\" might have been a more compelling film were it not for the lackluster, wooden performance Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role.  Cage has never been very adept at conveying complex emotions and his inability to provide any depth or shading to the psychologically tormented Enders goes a long way towards minimalizing the film's impact.  Adam Beach, on the other hand, brings a fresh-faced likability to the part of Ben, the Navajo, who, in many ways, takes on the Private Ryan role in the story.<br />For all the amazing battle scenes in the film, \\"Windtalkers\\" may just be one war film too many for us to cope with.\\"predictable\\" is really the key word here in describing much of this film.

B00009ATKS|5.0|I am not sure I agree with the reviewers suggesting that Young Team is still the alpha and omega of Mogwai.  I agree YT is a fantastic album but, if you listen to any of their other discs, it is CRITICAL to push the volume up a bit to really get the sound right.  Not necessarily '10' but if you go one or two notches higher than you are accustomed to, you will be rewarded with a much richer listening experience. <br />As far as Happy Songs goes though, I think it is a very rich album.  The noisy types of songs seem more oriented towards  melodic feedback than the more rythmic noise on Rock Action.  I find this both more listenable and more trippy than Rock Action. If that's what you're looking for.  If you are reading this though, that would be a given!!<br />I have not had much luck using the included Cubase demo to mess w/ Hunted By a Freak but I am sure I will figure it out one of these days.  Or find someone who knows what they are doing with it.  I think that this is also a great idea and a good way to educate the masses (or however many people buy these things...) about the intricacies of the recording process and a hint that DIY is the way to go w/ that stuff.  <br />Mogwai are much bigger than their albums but remember to crank it up a bit when you are listening to this!!
B000056HUA|5.0|This is an essential album in any rock collection.  The album is anchored in the title track, \\"L.A. Woman\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  \\"L.A. Woman\\" is a bass driven rocker perfect for driving the Malibu coast with the top down.  \\"Riders on the Storm\\" is \\"cool and slow with perfect precision\\" and is absolutely haunting.  The rest of the album contains nothing but rock and blues classics.    Why buy the DVD Audio?  This DVD-A is so well done that you almost have to go out and spend the price of a small car buying a good surround system.  The CD format doesn't measure the sound enough times per second to produce a natural sounding instrument.  CDs make a violin sound like it is being payed with a saw instead of a bow.  DVD-Audio more than doubles the sampling rate, and fixes the problem.  The Densmore's drums and cymbals are crisp and natural.  The guitar and keyboards are warm.  And Jim Morrison's voice sounds human and has a real bite to it.  After listening to this DVD-A, you will not want to listen to your CDs again, except on a car stereo or a walkman.
0684803356|5.0|This is one of the greatest modernist novels to deal with the subject of war.  Set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, this novel explores war as it really is, not as what it is glorified or vilified to be according to the whims of a journalist or novelist.  There is very little of the actual war in the foreground of the plot--the entire novel spans only about four days--but the relationships of the characters and their interaction with one another allows the reader to see what war is like from the viewpoint of those who participate in it.  Like Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, this book deals with the psychological and human ramifications of war.<br /> The hero is Robert Jordan, an American idealist fighting in Spain on the side of the `Republic,' or Communist, party.  Opposite the `Reds' are the so-called fascists.  At the beginning, Jordan has an unflinching and unwavering duty to the cause, but the people he meets and a girl he falls in love with alter somewhat his outlook.  The bulk of the novel deals with Jordan's own philosophy, but also with the philosophy of the band of guerillas he is assigned to complete a mission with.  Through his love for the girl, Maria, and his interaction with the scheming rebel leader Pablo and his wife Pilar, Jordan learns much about life and war.<br /> The plot moves quickly enough, and all leads up to the final climactic battle at the bridge.  This is perhaps Hemingway's finest moment, and his treatment of the battle and fate of the group is nothing short of masterful.  The quote from John Donne \\"never send to know for whom the bell tolls\\"  looms ominously throughout the novel, and the battle of the bridge and the final, chilling moment of truth for Robert Jordan drives home the harrowing fact that is the reality of war: \\"it tolls for thee.\\"
0553573403|3.0|A Game of Thrones recreates a complex Britannic feudal society subjugated by the vain ambitions of its squabbling lords and ladies. The chapters alternate between eight key characters without jumping around chronologically. The story that unfolds is light on both supernatural invention and adrenaline pumping action. Instead we are spun a tale of political intrigue with an insight into the motivations of some of the key players. The manifold characters are well drawn and the plot is well crafted. However, in a book that focuses on the trials and tribulations of its characters I came away caring too little about any of them to find out what fates await them in the sequel. An admirable work that left me wanting more - but not of this story.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Hot off the success of the excellent &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and the thrilling &quot;X-Men,&quot; &quot;Daredevil&quot; was chosen to be the next possible franchise for the Marvel Comics movies. Starring Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, this film pleases anybody looking for some great comic-book action. Michael Clarke Duncan is an excellent pick to play the evil Kingpin, who murdered Murdock's father when Murdock was only 12. The blind Matt has powers of echo-location that allow him to &quot;see.&quot; This film could be a little longer (it runs only 100 minutes), but what's there is good enough. Another reason to watch is for the ruthless Bullseye (Colin Farrell), who can hit any target he wishes. &quot;Daredevil&quot; is a fun, action-packed flick that will definitely entertain.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is probably one of my top three movies!  Actually, it may be my favorite!  It is a very symbnolic tale and if you haven't seen it yet, what is wrong with you?  An amazing cast, Jake Gyllenhal, Drew Barrymore, Noah wylie, Patrick Swayze...come on now!  I wont say more becuase the other reviews have covered it well, but GET THIS FLICK!!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|I love Clockwork Orange, and think it was a masterpiece. The fight scenes in this movie between the rival gangs seem to me, to be just that, rip-offs from that movie, whether by accident or intentionally, who cares?<br /> DiCaprio is better than I thought. Lewis stinks in the 1st DVD and is better in the 2nd; that sums this whole movie up really: the 1st half stinks, and the second is worth the watching.      <br />Still, towards the end, you can't help but feel what a moron DiCaprio's character is. Would you do what he did for 3 hours?!<BR>He could have bagged a pistol, shot him in the first half hour and been done with it all! But, we wouldn't have had the big epic to watch.<br /> I own this and think it's hilarious movie (the violence with Lewis is really funny-seriously), but give it only 3 1/2 stars because of the ridiculous mistake the director made of throwing in the subplot at the end, where we have the draft fury mixed in with the main plot, which should have been followed straight through.<br /> 3 1/2 STARS FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF DVD's, USA.
B00005JMCR|1.0|I sat though 15 minutes of this \\"film\\" and then walked out. It's the worst piece of [film]that I have ever seen and should have been rated XXX for the language alone. Save your money and don't bother with this one....
B000063DI9|5.0|I am younger then most people who listen to Iron Maiden, but this album I think is the most underated album of all time.  I personally like this one better then Metalica's self titled album.  If anybody wants to get any Iron Maiden album, this is the one to get.  <BR>     I think all of these songs should have made it to there greatest hits ablum.  When I got it I thought that there might be a few songs on here that I would like, but all of them are really excellent heavy metal songs.<BR>     Seventh Son of the Seventh Son, Can I Play with Madness, Moonshine, The Evil that Men Do, and Only the Good die Young, are my favorites.  This album is done excellent, but not over done.  They also do not use curse words to express how they feel, the lyrics of this album are 20 years a head of there time

0790736039|5.0|I have read many of the reviews before I decided to put mine into words.  I agree with most of them, but so far the other reviewers didn't know the other or read the book (which helps out).  The movie and the book IT are both 5 star to me.  It took me somewhere beween 3 to 4 months to read the book, and I watched the movie many times before, during, and after that period of time.  I still to this day consider IT to be my favorite movie.  So far, IT is also my favorite Stephen King novel.<br /><br />  The reason I watched the movie so many times during the time I read the novel was so I could appreciate them both for what they were.  The movie does NOT do the book justice to what King's mind tries to impose upon his readers therefore the book scared me far more then the movie.  I thought the actors, both children and adult, did a wonderful job at diplaying the emotions and fear that they are supposed to portray.  If you like the movie, take a little extra time and read the book.  You won't be disapponted.

This one, in which it does it wonderfully, and two other just as delightful books: The Little Guide To Happiness, and Present Moment awareness.  Don't wait for things, today is a present, unwrap it.  So is this book!
0780623703|4.0|I won't belabor the reader with yet another synopsis of this film, as other reviewers here have that ground covered quite well.  Instead I'll simply explain why a conservative Christian like me would be so high on this film.<br />No, the moral message is not tidy.  Yes, some of the subject matter is definitely questionable.  But the fact is, I've rarely seen a film tackle this difficult subject matter quite so well.  The ultimate message seems to be that TV's golden age had its good points, but the repression and impatient conformity seen in that era were prime reasons the modern age may be better in spite of itself.<br />As for the film's apparent conclusion that a more modern mindset is preferable, however, even that seems ambiguous, as some '50s lives are torn apart by the changes that take place in the story.  The modern age certainly has its downside in lost innocence, but for some that cost has paid off in a different sociologic dynamic that opens new doors.  Those of us who would perhaps prefer a more &quot;pleasant&quot; world must consider the downside there as well, as it cannot be denied for instance that intolerance existed to an unacceptable degree, with unacceptable results.  The '50s world was certainly not as pleasant as it was portrayed in the Pleasantville-type sitcoms of the '50s, and the culture clash in this film is indeed thought-provoking and memorable.<br />To sum up, the filmmaker correctly portrays the &quot;then or now&quot; dilemma with fondness for the past but hope for the future.  The cinematography, sets, and effects are spectacular, and there's rarely a false note in the performance of any of the actors, but ultimately what I'm left with is a not-unpleasant discomfort over the message left behind by the story of this unique film.  It's something I'll ponder for quite awhile, and that's a gift that should earn any film four stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best sci-fi's in a long time... too bad Fox killed it.  <br />The characters were intriguing... Each represented a part of American culture, but didn't develop the characters in a way that made it seem like a soap opera.<br />The show had a dark feel with a constant undercurrent of comedy.  Storylines were fresh and inspiring for even the most die-hard SciFi fan.<br />I will buy as soon as this is available.  Hope they make a movie soon, too!
B00009UW0N|1.0|Scenes in other dvd releases of Halloween had blue tint to them. The movie also had a fall season look to it. Anchor Bay messed up once again. Sure the picture is sharper, but all the blue tint has been washed out. For example there is a scene where we see a door which is tinted blue, now the door is more white and shows no blue at all. There are a lot more scenes like this as well. The fall season look is gone too. Anchor Bay now has all the grass looking bright green.  For them to change the classic vision of the movie is pathetic. The only reason anyone should buy this is because of the extras. If you want the movie with a great transfer check out the LE or the restored version.  This supposedly great dvd also does not have the extended version. WAY TO GO ANCHOR BAY!
B00009UW0N|1.0|I am advising all prospective buyers to avoid this release. It has been incorrectly color timed, which means a lot of the blue and orange hues which were an integral artisic aspect of the film have been deliberately altered. Someone at Anchor Bay had this film's artisic presentation altered to fit their own desires! This is not the definitive version of the film and should be avoided at all costs until Anchor Bay does a recall. Try to find your self a copy of the limited edition put out a few years ago; that is a great disc. Dean Cundey intended for the movie to have the blue hues and seasonal fall apppearance (despite when it was filmed). With the \\"remaster\\", all aspects of that color timing have been lost. I do not think Anchor Bay was trying to screw this up, rather it was carelessness on their part. They did an excellent job on the prior DVD issue which featured mild edge enhancement but was nonetheless faithful to the film. Despite my request for a recall, it will not happen. Please avoid this version and track down the older one with the correct color timing so that you may experience this film as it was intended. Dean Cundey (cinematographer) approved the old reissue; not this one as far as I know. I love Anchor bay but they screw up on too many occasions.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Quite simply the best audio i've ever heard.  I NEVER get tired of listening to it in SACD.  The best one out there hands down.  Buy it now.
B00005JLSE|5.0|And Fosse would have loved it too. It's really a challenge to translate a stage production to the screen and keep the energy and excitement of the original. <br />Where \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was manic (which was kinda the point), \\"Chicago\\" is fast-paced and edgy. The performers were amazing, both individually and emsemble. <br />Compare it to \\"Cabaret\\" and rachet it up about 25% and you'll be close.<br />I don't buy movies because I rarely watch them more than once. I'll buy this one.
0060012218|4.0|Russel, a gay sophomore in high school, goes to an Internet chat room and meets \\"GayTeen\\" who is from his home town and even goes to his school! They agree to meet by the playing field at school that night. The person is a very popular jock named Kevin Land. Kevin just that day had teased Russel after gym class about being a \\"fag,\\" and Russel had successfully bluffed. Kevin befriends Russel and Russel gets to visit the \\"Land of the Popular\\" and does some things of which he is not proud, including joining in teasing of the most unpopular boy in school, Brian. Russel's best friend Gunnar gets him to go on double dates, so that Gunnar can have a girlfriend. Russel comes out to his other best friend, Min, and she is bisexual. The gay/lesbian/bisexual kids start a club, naming it the Georgraphy Club, so that it will not attract any other kids. One day a black girl, Belinda, says she wants to join. Russel befriends Brian, who did him a favor. There were some intrusive asides to the reader in this book, and there were moments when I would have liked to know more about what Russel was thinking and feeling. Otherwise, this is a fine book about a gay teenager learning about friendship, forgiveness, and integrity.
B000099T2L|1.0|Everybody thought this cd would be real good because of the 1st single &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; with it's famous booty dance but after the booty dance is gone this cd is nothing but a BIG dangerous disappointment.  A couple songs on the cd are alright, not very good but it wasn't bad enough that you had to skip them, which i did a lot because the cd is WHACK!! The song with the legendary Luther Vandross is a very good song she actually song real good. I thought this cd was going to be awesome but it wasn't, so don't waste your money buying the cd listen to it first online then if you like it buy it but if you have a musical taste like me you do what you gotta do. I personally think Monica's &quot;After the Storm&quot; cd was WAY better then Beyonce's cd so if you looking for a good cd this summer Monica is the right one, just look over this poor excuse for a cd.
B0000027RL|5.0|There isn't much that can be said of Pearl Jam's Ten anymore. It is certainly an album that has stood the test of time, with many of its tracks still played on on rock and alternative radio stations across America today. The music is solid and straightfoward; pure Seattle grunge that defined the era. However, superb songwriting, excellent guitar work, and Eddie Vedder's gripping voice full of emotion, pain, and torment, solidify this release as head and shoulders above much of the grunge sound that appeared in early '91 and '92. As such, this is definately an album that every rock fan should have in their catalog.
B00005JMC6|5.0|The tale of the Whale Rider is about courage, love and compassion. <br />Though Paka (Pai's grandfather) may not have known at the time, for the person he was searching for his whole life was in front of him, he admits and recognizes his stubborness through his granddaughter (Pai). It is Pai who shows him and her community the way to live, love and grow stronger with each other. <br />The scenery is beautiful and awesome. <br />Maybe at times, the movie was a little slow, but does show the passage of time within the faces and actions of its characters. <br />I recommend to read the book too! You'll understand more later after watching the movie. Will be getting the movie ASAP when it hits DVD! While watching the movie at the theaters, it hits home on some parts... very emotionally! Bring a tissue or a box of them!
B00005JLSE|5.0|To compare the two movies is ludicrous. Chicago is a musical based on Bob Fosse's work and Moulin Rouge is just a mishmash of different song types. None of the songs had anything to do with the time peroid. Renee Zellwegger and Catherine Zeta Jones did a great job as did Richard Gere. ... Chicago is not only a great movie but it also had a great soundtrack.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'd like to thank all the people who wrote in to complain about how terrible this album is. Your 3 to 4 letter words were quite descriptive.  <br />I will not bow into pretentiousness in this review.  I don't think you have to be a genius to appreciate Radiohead's music.  You do however have to have an appreciation for something &quot;different&quot;.  <br />This album has some of the most amazing and beautiful music that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.  How this band is able to write music that is so perfect yet so different from every other band you have ever heard continues to amaze me.  <br />If you don't enjoy this album, I honestly feel sorry for you.  Give it another listen maybe 3.  Open your mind.  Forget everything you know about music.  Once it takes a hold of you it will never let go.  <br />You can thank me later.

I started reading it on a long flight and I couldn't control my laughter.  It was by far one of the best books I have read.  I have also read Kinsella's other 2 books &quot;Shopaholic takes Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Shopaholic Ties the Knot&quot; and both have the same style and humor as the original.  Right now this book is being passed around to all my friends who also give it great reviews.  A must read for any shopaholic... you know who you are!

One of my favorite James Brown tunes.  This cd also shows what a genuinely talented singer James Brown is with slow tracks like &quot;These Foolish Things.&quot;  The music style is pretty varied so there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  I knew very little about this cd and now I love it!
B000002HGD|4.0|Long before there was Play, 18, the Gwen Stefani duets, or videos in spacesuits, there was Everything is Wrong, the album where Moby slid in under the radar and came into his own. It's an ambitious and groundbreaking album, that goes from piano laced ambient (&quot;Hymn&quot; and the seminal &quot;God Moving Over the Face of the Waters&quot;) to infectious get-on-your-feet techno (&quot;Feeling So Real&quot;) to trance like investigations into deeper musical channels (&quot;First Cool Hive&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;, which is a personal favorite). Though a bit uneven, this is by far a defining album for Moby, and an extremely worthwhile listen for anyone who enjoyed &quot;Play&quot; or &quot;18&quot;.
B0000A36J1|5.0|Having already reviewed the August release of the theatrical version, I still felt compelled to weigh in on the Special Extended Edition, which will likely be much more of a complete version of the Two Towers. This is epic filmmaking at it's best. Peter Jackson has tapped a veritable fountain of creative juices, and he weaves a tapestry of sorrow, joy, and terror like no other director in the history of modern cinema. The Two Towers is the penultimate adventure film; a treatise on war, an examination of genocide, and a heart-wrenching look into the schisms of greed, and ultimate power. Many who see this film will look past the tortured ramblings of Gollum as nothing more than a gimmick, a minute-to-minute laugh track from a loose-cannon gladhand. But those that take a second to delve beneath the cowl of Gollum's apparent insanity will find a depth of character that is as of yet unmatched in the fantasy genre. Many who see this film will balk at the elves heroic arrival to the gates of Helm's Deep. A story driven on emotion at times requires such artistic license, and this alteration worked for this viewer. With no change in the outcome of the \\"victory\\" by the embattled warriors of Rohan, the elves played only to enhance an already emotionally exhausting and kinetically exciting battle for surivival. The performances were astonishing, from Aragorn's noble and heroic warrior-to-be King, to Gimli's soft-hearted and motherly banter, the cast has pulled of a feat rarely accomplished: Total Cinematic Synergy. From the music to the costume design, from the breathtaking cinematography to the painstaking editing, The Two Towers is a triumph. Relish the time we have spent in Peter Jackson's wonderfully imagined Middle Earth. Embrace this vision, for it is one that is singular in the art of filmmaking. Thank you Mr. Jackson.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is so much better than any other recording i've heard so far of Les Mis.  <br />Colm Wilkinson: The one and only Valjean, being that he's on most of the album, cept the international cast.<br />Philip Quast: The best Javert! Much improved of the international cast<br />Ruthie Henshall:  although I have partial regard to Debbie Byrn for she was the first Fantine i have heard, I think Ruthie Henshall is amazing!!! Much much much better than Randy Graff<br />Lea Salonga: better than the whiny Francis Rufelle (or whatever her name is) and on my own is one of my favorite songs thanx to her.<br />Micheal Ball: THE marius<br />Cosette: When I heard she was on Pochahontas I nearly flipped out of my chair.  She is excellent!<br />Thenardiers: Better than any other.  Alum Armstrong and Jenny Galloway make it funnier and Master of the House sounds so much better.<br />If you have to get one Les Mis recording this is!
B00005JLSE|5.0|i thought this was a great movie. it is short, so those of  you who are like my mum, dont have to get up halfway through the movie. It wasn't my favorite movie, but i would definately watch it over and over again. The dance choreography was great. i definately would recomend this to anyone
B00005JLRT|1.0|Worst Trek film ever.  I loved the Star Trek movies and series, well except DS9, but we won't discuss that here.  This film was the worst.<br />The story made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Why is a human clone in charge of the Romulan Empire?  That is never fully explained, or not believably.  Why does the villain not take what he needs from Picard early in the film?  He has ample opportunity.  What does the villain hate Picard and the Federation so much?  Again, not nearly adequately explained.  <br />The special effects were acceptable.  Not great, but acceptable.  But without an adequate story line, the movie just degenerates into action movie with no plot.  <br />If you want to see a better Star Trek Movie, get one of the previous ones, any one of them is better than this piece of garbage.
B000002B30|5.0|This collection is good, if straightforward, in documenting all of Bruce Springsteen's major hits, both with and without the E Street Band. Of the new material included, Murder Incorporated is probably the best track, exhibiting Bruce's rock sensability and guitar power. Those who are big Bruce fans won't find much to celebrate here, but it is a good collection for those who like Bruce's radio hits or are not too familiar with his music.
B00006AW2F|2.0|A waste of money<br />Very poor choice of tracks<br />Heart of Stone is a good alt version<br />I'm going down is also a good track<br />Rest is awfull<br />Don't buy it!
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is my FAVORITE CD. Amy's lyrics are touching. I can really relate to them..its like she's been through the same things I'm going through with songs like Everybody's Fool and My Immortal. I give Evanescence 5 STARS!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is my favorite movie. I have seen it 9 times in the thearter. I will see it again and again. and its got like 2 speacial features that the extended edition wont have. this is a must buy movie!
B00001R3C4|5.0|Surfing the internet, I noticed that somehow no one has ever reviewed this album- which is a travesty- so I thought this short review is in order (and its the only one ive ever posted).  This is a work of real genius.  It has been extremely influential for a lot of bands.  It might take a while to get into - or you may never get into it.  It's rough, hard, messy, passionate, and can be hard to listen to.  It's also completely brilliant rock music.<br />Ah, I take it back .... you'll definitely get into it.  Regardless, I really believe that a life lived having never heard this album is lacking something significant.  This album is a real teacher of what is possible in music ..... buy it.  Seriously.  Then get &quot;Loveless&quot; (as good as this and very different) and the My Bloody Valentine EPs...  all great ...  a shame this band is finished.
B00005JLRT|5.0|When Star Trek Nemesis came out, I read some very luck warm reviews on it and I figured they were probably wrong; but then as the weeks passed, I noticed Nemesis did not do, all that well, at the Box office; So I began to wonder if the critics were right. I figured I would just get the DVD when It came out, I am not much for going to theaters anyway. Usually I get the star trek movies on the day of release, but this time due to the two reasons I mentioned above, I delayed getting this one until just recently. And my initial thought was right, the critics were wrong. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good Nemesis is. I love the whole Picard &quot;Romulan as the human weapon&quot; Clone thing; and I liked the Death and rebirth of the beloved Data thing as well. The Clone of Picard reminded me somewhat of Luke Skywalker, finding out, Vader was His father, but it is still fresh in its own way. The death of Data, to save His crew and the enterprise, was both sad and yet comforting, knowing that his memories were transferred to B4. Very cool stuff. If your a trek fan you will love this movie.
0783231032|5.0|This movie has stellar performances by many great actors. Ned Beatty is superb, Slim Pickens is unforgettable, John Belushi is extremely wacky, Dan Ackroyd is top of head, Treat Williams is completely in character. This movie is, was and always shall be the spoof that it is. I would say it is Dr.Strangelove meets M*A*S*H* Meets It's a Mad,Mad,Mad,Mad world , Meets Animal House all in one. It is funny as hell. I give it 5 stars as I still chuckle to myself after seeing it, picturing it in my mind. Ned Beatty firing a cannon through his house is uproarously funny,and Slim Pickens in iterrogation is fall down and laugh funny. Completely MADCAP..... This movie is a CLASSIC.
B0000959N0|2.0|OK, I was reading these reviews, and I just don't get them.  Some people are acting as if this movie is the greatest thing in history (it's not), while others act as if it was just the worst thing ever (it's not).  It's mediocre!!!  I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could.  There really isn't much of a plot, but the special effects are tight, and I guess the messages of love, justice, etc. can be cool.  Personally, I would not buy this (unfortunately I did) but I would rent it at least.  Just don't expect it to be Spiderman or something.  By the way, if you're a rock fan, check out the soundtrack for the movie.
B0000025T6|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for Bruce and his musical genius.  But it took time to develop!  I was in Jr. High when he came out with, &quot;Born in the USA.&quot;  And I have to admit I didn't like it, at first.<br />But as I began to delve into what Bruce had to offer, besides what was on the radio... I was drawn into his musical world.<br />I recently heard his newest album, &quot;The Rising&quot; at a friends house and was reminded just how much I am drawn to the dark, contemplative side of Bruce's music.  I started reading about some of his older albums and came across this one.  I knew this was the Springsteen album for me... and I must say it did not disappoint!<br />This album is full of great story songs and dark slices of what America has to offer.  Not everything about this country is pretty and bright.  Man has a dark side and it's ok to talk about it.  That's what I admire most about Bruce,  like Johnny Cash he's not afraid to delve into this realm of darkness.  Like Cash he also knows that there is a way out... redemption can be found.<br />I particularly like the song, &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;.  It is a brilliant story song.  It is all about the conflict between duty and loyal to family.  The story teller is a policeman whose brother Franky, &quot;Just ain't no good.&quot;  His brother ends up killing a man in a bar fight and, as a Highway Patrolman he must chase Franky. The pivotal moment comes when the patrolman let's his brother speed on into the night, to the Canadian border.<br />That moment of decision hangs in the air like a dark cloud.  Then Bruce comes back with his haunting repeated chorus.<br />&quot;Me and Franky  laughin' and drinkin'. Nothin' feels better than blood on blood.  Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played 'Night of the Jonestown Flood.'<br />I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would. Man turns his back on his family, well he just ain't no good.&quot;<br />Bruce is a master songwriter...  a master storyteller...  If you like folk like music with a bluesy sound you'll love this album.you like folk like music with a bluesy sound you'll love this album.
0671042858|1.0|I have never read anything else from Stephen King besides this book, which I just finished less than an hour ago, and I absolutely hated it. It read VERY slow, and it was extremely boring. Right at the beginning of the book, the girl, Trisha, gets lost in the woods.Then you spend the rest of the book following her around. She's tired, shes sick, she's hungry, she's frightened- SO WHAT?! I saw no point to this story whatsoever. I was waiting for some big climatctic ending, and there was nothing at all. Again, I am not familiar with his works, but the whole thing seemed way too bubblegum sweet to be written by a person with the frightening reputation Stephen King has. Maybe his other stuff is better, but I thought this book was boring. I couldn't stand it by page 20 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00008MZ0O|5.0|Ok, I will agree with the haters of this movie in that it didn't even come close to the reality of street racing. But this is just a movie, so you need the pretty boys to take the leads or else people won't be impressed enough to actually see it. But the fact is that it has the three things men love most, fast cars, hot girls, and good action. So it don't matter if you get Michael Jackson to start in this movie its still gonna do good. So be like me and ignore the lame acting and lack of actual racing and just enjoy it.
B000000JO3|4.0|Leaving nothing out, this album shows Minor Threat's first several minute-long three-chords and a shout songs.  The best examples are \\"Straight Edge\\", \\"In My Eyes\\", and \\"Stand Up\\".  About halfway through, the songs expand to 2 minutes, but loose little of their punch.  I like the humor shown in \\"Cashing In\\", and the cover song \\"Good Guys\\" (by the Standells) is another very good one.
B00005JLXE|5.0|The reviews on this movie are so mixed that it doesn't even seem like everyone saw the same film.  Why some don't like it I will never understand.  There are just so many great things to say about DAREDEVIL! It is so dark, so fascinating and original... That's why it would be a mistake to compare it with ANY other super hero film. <br />The biggest problem I've seen with all the other comic book flicks is that they lose their appeal because the filmmakers try too hard to please literally EVERYONE from five-year-olds to middle aged moms. Such is not the case here. Daredevil was especially made for lovers of original cinema and obviously for the comic book fans as well. <br />The movie is very fast paced, and it seems as though every single scene in the film has at least one intriguing or memorable moment. The acting and the music score also deserve a lot of praise. We hear way too many other soundtracks that simply don't push the dramatic moments to their full potential. <BR>  <BR>The bottom line is that Daredevil may not be for everyone, but those who do appreciate it will find themselves watching it over and over again... This is what great filmmaking is all about! <br />BRING ON THE SEQUELS!!!!
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1983 at a 'Who Film Festival'. To see it on the big screen was incredible. This film cemented in my mind, who was the best live band ever. Have been waiting for this DVD release patiently for a few years now. I am blown away by the special features that come with this movie (DTS surround, director commentary, Roger Daltrey interview, alternate camera angles, 5.1 mix of the studio version of \\"Who Are You\\", assorted featurettes). The producers of this DVD really did a great job with the mastering and packaging of this product. You WILL NOT be disappointed.<br />Reasons why you should buy this DVD:<br />1. You will not find a better live version of any of the songs in this movie, on any other Who release. Trust me, I own every Who release there is, and many bootlegs. <br />2. Interviews with the band - Townshend and Keith Moon are in rare (not sober) form. These really show the four distinct personalities within the band. <br />3. Rare performances from the very early years & television programs that have not been released on anything else.<br />4. The special features mentioned above. Check out the multi angle feature for \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" - 4-6 camera angles are available on each, so you can watch any member of the band for the entirety of the songs. Also contains a feature to view/listen to the same two songs with John Entwistle's bass part on an isolated track. Besides being an interesting feature, imagine this would really appeal to somebody that has tried to learn his bass lines. <br />5. The 'My Generation' opening on the Smothers Brothers show. If that kind of performance went down on Leno or Letterman today, it would probably result in authorities shutting down the show and some arrests being made.<br />6. Song selection - Live cuts from every Who studio album through Who Are You, except Quadrophenia. Plus some off cuts thrown in like 'Cobwebs and Strange', 'Success Story', 'Shout and Shimmy'.<br />7. The tour scene through John Entwistle's home, showing off his guitar collection and gold record skeet shooting ability.<br />8. Last live performances of Keith Moon before he died in 1978.<br />There may be other bands with better production in the studio, such as Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones, but this movie does a great job of showing you who the best live performance band is. Hands down it has to be The Who. Live performance was and is the Who's niche. Production can't hide what other bands are not capable of on stage.<br />If you need your live fix of Quadrophenia songs, I strongly recommend 'The Who: Live at Royal Albert Hall'. Townshend acoustic version of 'Drowned', Entwistle \\"BASS Cam\\" solo on '5:15' is a masterpiece.
B00009W0U4|1.0|There are interesting things about this movie; for a start, only french cinema can come out with such a thing, though i'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. However, this means that some of the things you get are so characteristically french, and i don't mean to be anti-french, but just to comment on a theme that's unfortunately is too pervasive in french movies. Examples are the chit-chat about sex in the tube, only french people would have such a chit-chat with such a choice of topic and such expressed opinions. And only french people would bother put it on film. Unfortunately, if you've seen enough french movies you'll get pretty bored with too much emphasis on sex, and things will feel repetitive and redundant. <BR>The violence is sorta extreme, it's probably the worst one can think of. Newsweek said this was the most walked-out-of movie of the year, and true to its reputation i think a third to a half of the audience walked out of the theatre after that scene. <BR>The rape scene is labouriously prolonged, a little too prolonged that even an actress like monica belluci seemed at times not entirely sure how she should be acting. <BR>Overall, you can't help but feel the movie, in its extremism and deliberate intent to shock, is nothing more than the product of a very jovenile mind, in a very french way, which, knowing how extreme the french can be, only means annoying jovenile.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is probably the best White Stripes album yet due to the consistant songwriting.  Lyrical, Jack White can write a good blues lyric (&quot;It's quite possible that I'm your third man girl / but it's a fact that I'm the seventh son&quot;) as well as sound sweetly old-fashioned (&quot;I want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart&quot;).  He's in typical fine form.  His guitar playing is helped by the use of an octave pedal which gives a stinging tone, especially in &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; &amp; &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot;.  Meg's drumming is Meg's drumming, and she doesn't make big mistakes, she just stays behind the beat.<br />The album ends with a fun three-vocal song, &quot;Well it's true&quot;, and I'd give the album five stars except it drags a little in the middle.  I'm not a big fan of songs 3,4,5,&amp; 7.  The music concrete of &quot;Little Acorns&quot; is a recurring Stripes theme, and I think they could find a different way to do dissonance.  Although I'm not very crazy about &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;, it DOES deserve an award for having one of the most annoying sounds in the middle of it (a screechy guitar note and Jack's voice overdubbed several times).<br />It's a very good disc and highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is actually one of the better war movies to come out in recent history, despite some of the other reviews here.  The special effects were quite impressive, especially when you find out just how little they had to work with, and how much military cooperation they were able to muster.  The acting was fine.  And because it was based on actual historical fact (they actually had Pearl Harbor survivors on site to lend their memories and experience) something might be learned from it.  For example, the Doolittle raid.......something that generally isn't taught in high school history classes.  And yet it should be.  Sure, alot of the stuff has been done before, but never all in one movie.  And what movie hasn't had repeated effects in it?  Because a plane blows up in one movie, that means no other movie can include a plane blowing up, for fear of being labelled a bad movie?  A movie is created to tell a story, not simply to introduce new effects.  Alot of these reviews are way off-base.  For example, the reviewer from Germany spends an inordinate amount of time telling how bad the movie is without actually explaining why, other than the fact that it didn't give the Japanese perspective.  Well......the movie is about the American perspective, so go figure.  Including the Japanese perspective would have made as much sense as including the South African perspective.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  And as far as the analogy of making a movie about 9/11......I'm sure that it too, will be no good unless we include the Muslim perspective in a movie about Americans.
B000089RVX|2.0|When I first heard this band, I was thinking that Chester finally realized that Mike Shinoda and himself were the problems of Linkin Park and let a young woman named Amy Lee take over the band, only to change their name to something more goth-sounding and feminine.<br />Bring Me To Life was an average song the first time it was played. Not bad. Not great. I decided to pick up the album and I was not satisfied with the 21 bucks I spent at FYE.<br />I expected this album to be along the line of Bring Me To Life and their new single, Going Under, but not exactly the same, because all bands like variety, non?<br />However, further into the album, the three words what, the, and hell were going through my mind. In various orders, mind you, because by the end of the CD, every song just sounds the same because it just keeps getting slower, more drawn out, and boring.<br />While there are some standout tracks (My Last Breath, My Immortal, Tourniquet), there aren't many. And most people don't even know that Tourniquet is a cover, so some are saying that Amy Lee/Ben Moody did a fantastic job writing that song. I enjoyed My Immortal because I'm a fan of artist + piano = music without band. Ala some Tori Amos and Fiona Apple tracks. <br />Amy Lee has a powerful voice, I agree. But it never changes. At all. It's bold throughout the entire album, and it stays in the same range. I might have enjoyed this album better if she used her voice a little bit more and if they weren't so boring by the end of the CD.<br />At least you can buy it for the pretty sleeve.
B000069AUI|5.0|When i first bought the album 'Parachutes' by a new band called Coldplay i new instantly that they were something special.<BR>It was more than the fantastic songs and the obvious talent of Chris Martin and company, It was more of a feeling, the record actually seems to have a soul. I remember writing a review for Parachutes and saying that they could be as big as U2 one day.<BR>Well I am pleased to say i was right, and this 2nd album proves that Coldplay have got what it takes to make it that big. In fact as one reviewer has said already, this band is one album away from becoming one of the most important bands in modern music. <br />From the dramatic openings of 'Politik' to the hair raising, spine tingling moment when the drums and guitar kick in on 'Amsterdam' this is an album that you will listen to again and again. That moment in Amsterdam is easily my favourite 25 seconds of music that has ever been produced, it always makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up!<br />This album is so unlike 'Parachutes' but at the same time strangly connected, The songs are bolder and there is an amazing sense of confidence oozing throught his album. From the early paranoia of Chris Martin not thinking he was good enough, and the band seemingly fearful of doing the wrong thing to a Band that know they are good, that realise they are on the edge of somthing big, This is the transistion of Parachutes to A Rush of blood, This the sign of a good band becoming a great band.<br />The piano is one of the most overlooked instruments in modern music, and listening to this album you start to wonder why. The use of Piano in most of Coldplay's music to date really gives them a distinctive sound and Chris's voice seems perfect for piano led songs. Radiohead this aint - don't beleive the people who will tell you otherwise.<br />All the songs on this album are brilliant, It may lack some of the feeling that Parachutes produced, but the quality of the songs easily make up for that. And judging by the quality of the new songs they have been playing on tour recently, the next album is going to confirm their status as the best band in the world!<br />See this band live - they are fantastic!<br />And buy this album now! <br />And if you do not own 'Parachutes' then buy that too, you will not be dissapointed.
0694003611|5.0|I got this book when my child was first born. I read it once and didn't pick it up again until recently. My girl is 2 years old and she loves this book. We read it every night now and she finishes the words to each page. It seems to be really good for developing memory. It's very simple and cute. I think that having children say goodnight to everything is a really great idea. I'm sure that my daughter is more relaxed about bedtime because of that.
0553573403|4.0|Plenty.<br />That doesn't mean there is no magic in \\"A Game of Thrones.\\" There is some, and more as the series flows on. But this first book is primarily historical fantasy, occurring in a world with incredibly long seasons, dragons, and warrior-queens, but still recognizably based on the history of England, especially the Wars of the Roses.<br />It is Martin's triumph that he transforms this world into something of his own creation, and his writing talent has all the magic he needs.<br />This first book follows the adventures of eight viewpoint characters: six of the Stark family, one of the Lannister family that opposes them, and one of the deposed Targaryen royal dynasty. The storylines intersect and then spin away again. Characters who are in close contact at one point may meet each other again, or scatter to opposite ends of the Seven Kingdoms. And at least one storyline, that of Daenerys Targaryen, takes place on another continent altogether, only brushed by political decisions in the Kingdoms.<br />This can make sorting out the plot confusing at first, but one of the grand things about it is that the plot does not focus on a hero and heroine, making all the rest of the viewpoint characters into sidekicks. *All* of these characters are part of the plot, and all of them have something important to say and do. One could argue that Lord Eddard Stark, who stands at the heart of most of the political action and is searching frantically for one of the book's main family secrets, is the hero, but the struggle of his wife to find out who nearly killed her son is just as important. So is his ... son's adventure on the Wall, and Tyrion Lannister's travel- both willing and unwilling- south and back north, and Dany's arranged marriage to a barbarian prince. Martin is an expert at making each character the center of his or her own universe, a hero or heroine in his or her own eyes.<br />And none of them are evil. Though we receive indications that a vast inhuman threat, in the form of a long winter, will soon descend on the Seven Kingdoms, there is no Dark Lord sitting on a throne and laughing. There are ordinary people, who may happen to be a bit crazy, but who are also following human motives such as trying to protect their children. The political intrigue spins out of those motivations, rather than out of forced advance of plot. This is yet another thing that makes the story such a breath of fresh air. Some of the characters may well be advancing along the lines of destiny, but they often don't know it.<br />Yet another thing the large absence of magic and destiny does is to make it more strange when it appears. Blood magic, foreseeing the future, and the bonds between the Stark children and their direwolves might seem commonplace bits of magic in a \\"normal\\" fantasy setting; in this one, they gleam like jewels in their settings. This helps to restore the sense of wonder that fantasies strive for and so rarely achieve.<br />This book is not perfect, of course. At times, Martin's making of human characters worked a little too well for me; one character, Sansa Stark, remains essentially a shallow and helpless pawn throughout the story, and it was nearly impossible for me to sympathize with her. At the same time, I was sure I was meant to sympathize with her. Such things make for an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. There were also some transparent tropes and very obvious symbolism, such as the dead direwolf the Starks find. Martin could be setting these up just to destroy them, but at other times he handles them delicately enough that I felt required to take them seriously. I was left unsure what to think or feel.<br />However, this book is a living, breathing thing, and some discomfort with living, breathing things is normal. And a great number of what I perceived as flaws here are worked out as the series progresses.<br />Martin has spun glory with 'A Song of Ice and Fire,' and this is only the first tapestry off his loom.the form of a long winter, will soon descend on the Seven Kingdoms, there is no Dark Lord sitting on a throne and laughing.

B00005JMCR|1.0|I have to admit, the American Pie movies are some of my guilty pleasures.  I laughed until it hurt through both movies.  I own both on DVD and watch them alot.  I looked forward to this movie, and saw it this evening- the opening night.<br />I am not surprised that they did not call this movie American Pie 3, because it does not seem like an \\"American Pie\\".  The jokes fall flat, everything seems stale.  Many key characters that were intregal parts of the first two movies are not here this time- Oz and Heather, Nadia, Vicky, Jessica and Sherman-ator are conspicuously absent.  And they are missed!  It is like having a family reunion with half the family missing and no explanation. The big party scene- the pivitol point of both Pie movies- absent in this one, and it is not as if there is not opportunity for it.  The first two movies revolved around the friendship of the four guys- Oz, Finch, Jim and Kevin.  But this time, it is left to Stifler to carry most of the movie.  This is not a good thing.  Stifler's character is great at peppering humor into the plot, not being the plot point.  Kevin has hardly any lines or screen time.  Jim's sexual bumblings are less shocking and funny- less buildup and less punch-line.  Finch- instead of dry wit is just dry mostly.  Michelle- \\"one time at bandcamp...\\"- is more serious and through most of the movie she is a person with substance and depth,instead of a vapid prop, when at the end it sinks and she is once again a blank staring vapid prop- without the bandcamp line or the funny half drugged voice she delivers it in.  There are some inexplicable plot lines too- Jim has never met Michelle's parents or sister.  How is that possible after three years of serious dating, when they went to prom together and grew up in the same town.  He never once went to her house?  It seems they were trying to throw in a \\"Meet the Parents\\" sub-plot, but it was developed in a half-hearted, frenzied way that is more confusing than funny.<BR> <BR>I gave it one star because I wanted to like this movie and just couldn't.  It seems they couldn't decide if it was an American Pie sequal or a wedding comedy- and in the end it didn't feel like either.  Poorly put together, poorly played out, poor lines, poor jokes and poor plot.
B00000ADG2|5.0|(77:39)<BR>Following Lauryn's newly found freedom from the Fugees, she manifested this brilliant first solo record, capturing the essence of r&amp;b, rap, soul and even doo wop in one lovely, heartfelt album. I don't remember how many Grammys this cd won, but it was quite an extraordinary number. And for once in a bluemoon, I think Lauryn Hill was deserving of all the success she garnered through her hardwork and unique talent. The megahits on this disc, Ex-Factor, Doo Wop, and Everything is Everything are some of the finest tracks, again being rightly rewarded for their beauty and originality. This isn't just a record to pick up for the hits though. There are many lovely niches of this lengthy album that make the listening experience very personal and loving. A number of brief classroom interludes are on this disc, where kids are talking about love and what it means/where it's found, with a beautiful acoustic guitar in the backround. Small things like that really help make this a timeless and endeering album. Also, such tracks as to Zion, Nothing Even Matters, and track 15, the first of two bonus tracks, are extremely captivating and gorgeous. All in all, this album is a very special piece of music and should be a hallmark in everyone's collection.
B00008DDXB|3.0|First of all I should probably admit that I've never read the Harry Potter books and I wasn't particularly a fan of the first movie.  My first thoughts when watching the second instalment was that it was better, but nothing spectacular.  The plot has Harry returning again from his horrible home life back to Hogwarts and a mystery concerning the Chamber of Secrets, forewarned to open up and release a hideous monster that can kill just by looking at you.  When characters start turning up paralysed it's up to Harry and his friends to uncover what's going on.<br />Just as in the first movie, this seems more concerned with translating the book directly to the screen rather than transferring its spirit.  This being the case it often comes across as a lot of set pieces, which are impressive as standalones but aren't linked together very well.  Unfortunately though, most of the enjoyment to be found here (at least for adults) comes from incidentals rather than from the whole film - a marvellous horticulture lesson, a flying car and the all too brief cameo appearances from a host of well-known British faces.  On a brighter note, Daniel Radcliffe isn't quite so wooden this time round (though it's hard to believe that he was hand-picked from thousands for much else than his resemblance to Harry).  Emma Watson as Hermione is fantastic though, again stealing every scene she's in, and Kevin Kline makes a highly enjoyable appearance as a fraudster magician.<br />Perhaps what makes The Chamber Of Secrets really stand out from The Sorcerer's Stone though is the fact that it is distinctly darker, perhaps preparing the way for things to come as Harry matures.  This darker tone is mostly evidenced by the darker finale, involving a giant snake that Harry must face alone, and some simplistic yet subtle references to racism against `mud-bloods' (those not born pure-wizard).  Plus, for anyone who's scared of spiders, you'd best avert your eyes before Harry and Ron enter the woods.  Thoughthe Harry Potter films are in fairness better done than many children's movies out there this still loses out to The Two Towers, although the fact that Y Tu Mama Tambien director Alfonso Cuaron is set to take the helm for The Prisoner Of Azkaban brings hope to any older viewers hoping for a more involving movie.  I'm told that the books, as well as being much better than the movies, are also getting much darker, and this is surely the direction to take in order to make Harry Potter more intriguing.
0312983867|5.0|Every time I lend the first book of the series to someone, she comes back asking for the next one, and the next one, and the next one.  These books are a guilty pleasure.<BR>Okay, she's recycled some material a few times too many, but the Ranger situation is what keeps me coming back.  That's what I enjoy most about this book ;-&gt;
B00005Y228|5.0|relaxing music.  perfect singing voice.  good to unwind with any time.
B000002HPV|5.0|This cd is so kewl i luv it i would highly recomend it to anyone!!  especially the song hunter!!  i luv it!  Buy it now!  her voice is just so unique and all her songs are different that is why i like her so much!
B00005JLH3|4.0|A BROOKLYN KID [NICK CANNON] GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH A DRUMMING SCHOLARSHIP TO ATLANTA A&amp;T UNIVERSITY, BUT WITH ONLY ONE PROBLEM, HE CAN'T READ MUSIC, BUT DESPITE THAT, HE STILL RISES THROUGH THE BAND RANKS. FUNNY AND DRAMATIC. IT'S A GOOD MOVIE THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S MORE TO BEING IN A BAND THAN JUST PLAYING MUSIC. A VERY GOOD MOVIE WITH A VERY GOOD SCRIPT. THE SCENE WHERE THE BAND PLAYS ''FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLE BEE'' IS AN INSTANT MUST SEE. AND ORLANDO JONES IS GREAT AS THE BAND DIRECTOR WHO HAS AN OLD SCHOOL MENTALITY. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a great movie and the rest of the DVD aren't much worse. The special features are very interesting and in depth. They explain how the movie was filmed and give other great insight about it. This is a great gift for anybody remotely interested in Sci-Fi or Action.
0800177975|3.0|A BOY [AUSTIN O BRIEN] IS GIVEN A MAGIC TICKET, AND WHILE HE'S WATCHING HIS MOVIE HERO'S LATEST FILM, HE ENDS UP BEING A PART OF THE ACTION. THIS STAR-STUDDED ACTION MOVIE IS OK, TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT FOR REAL, HOW DID AN INGMAR BERGMAN STORY GET INTO THIS MOVIE? ANYWAY, THE MOVIE STARTS OUT GREAT, BUT MOST OF THE SECOND HOUR IS A DISSAPOINTMENT. AS ALWAYS, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS FUN TO WATCH AS JACK SLATER, THE MOVIE COP WHO'S THE BOY'S IDOL. CHARLES DANCE IS COOL AS THE VILLAIN WHO MURDERED SLATER'S SECOND COUSIN. THIS MOVIE FEATURES APPEARANCES BY MANY STARS, SUCH AS; JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME, LITTLE RICHARD, TINA TURNER, TORU TANAKA, ART CARNEY, AND MANY MORE. FAR FROM ARNOLD'S BEST, BUT IT AIN'T A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book because it was required reading for my daughter entering sixth grade and I wanted to see what the school was giving her.  I was very impressed.  This book is really thought provoking and interesting.  I couldn't put it down.
0767802632|4.0|AFTER AN NYC COP [WILL SMITH] DISCOVERS AN ALIEN, HE JOINS A SECRET ORGANIZATION THAT MONITORS AND POLICES ALL ALIEN ACTIVITY ON EARTH. ASIDE FROM ALL THE ACTION, THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF COMEDY. GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND A GREAT VILLAIN, WHO'S PLAYED BY VINCENT D'ONOFRIO. SCI-FI FANS WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE. EVERYONE WHO'S A FAN OF WILL SMITH OR TOMMY LEE JONES, SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THEIR DVD COLLECTION. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL AND A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED TV SERIES.
B00005JMCR|5.0|This was absolutely hilarious non stop outrageous fun.  After seeing American Pie II,  I was a little skeptical about seeing this,  but now I cant wait for the next movie.  This ranked right up with American Pie 1 and maybee beyond.  Stiffler Rules!!  Not all the original stars are in this one but the key players are here and it worked for me,  although I'll miss Nadia but not for her acting skills.  See this but leave the young ones at home!
B00005JKZ3|3.0|THIS TIME, A FEMALE ALIEN [LARA FLYNN BOYLE] ENDANGERS THE EARTH IN A QUEST FOR THE LIGHT OF ZARTHA. AGENT J [WILL SMITH] MUST FIND THE RETIRED AGENT K [TOMMY LEE JONES] AND RESTORE HIS MIB MEMORY SO HE CAN RID THE EARTH OF THIS THREAT. NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S STILL OK. ONE HILLARIOUS SCENE IS WHERE MICHAEL JACKSON TRYS TO CONVINCE AGENT ZED [RIP TORN] THAT HE'S WORTHY OF BEING IN THE MIB. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, BUT ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS ANOTHER SEQUEL THAT FAILS TO COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL. BUT, THIS MOVIE MAKES AN ALRIGHT SCI-FI/COMEDY.
B00005A46T|5.0|iowa is a good album, u all say they didnt put the songs together very well but they did, u all just dont understand what real metal is if u say that, u all say the debut is better but thats not true, like the song eyeless, the chorus is, you cant see california without marlow brandos eyes, what does that tell you, now the song wait and bleed, that has trumendous meaning, but i personally think iowa is better, slipknot4life
0897500482|5.0|I have had my copy of this book for many years. I often refer to sections of it for advice and inspiration.<br />While Lee's views on the arts may be controversial, I think that anyone who has studied the arts seriously [ this excludes the black belt factories ) can appreciate the philosophical tone of the work. Too many of us get too into dictated technique and form as well as tradition to appreciate Lee's theories.<br />Jeet Kune Do is the style that is not a style. One that is infinitely flexible and adaptable to the individual and the situation.<br />I have been a Bruce Lee fan for 30 years and while I have never had the honor of meeting him or personally seeing him in form, I have been inspired and awed by him.<br />The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is an inspired and original work and to me embodies the essense of the true martial artist.<br />They are called the \\"arts\\" for a reason. How poor would other arts be if all of the artists merely copied others - I don't mean inspired by others but COPIED others. By and large that is what the so-called kwoons teach these days.One way and one way only, for $$$$$ we guarantee a black belt in 14 months.<br />Arts by definition are intensly personal and open for interpretation. How rich would the world of culture be today if Michealangelo merely copied Davinci or Monet was discouraged to explore impressionism saying it was not \\"true art\\"?<br />Lee breaks new ground and we who study him are the richer for it.<br />I recommend this book to any one with a serious interest in the martial arts. Those of you unfortunates stuck in black belt factories please study this book; it will open a new world for you.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I think you should get this movie only if you love marvel type movies such as Spiderman and whatnot.  The superhero in this one is blind... its almost comical but I don't think thats they way they wanted it to be interpreted.  The movie is getting hyped way more than it should...  Rent it before you buy it and spend your money on a dvd you'll actually watch more than once or twice.
B000021YQV|5.0|I truly didn't know what I'd been missing. From the opening notes of &quot;Prison Song&quot; to the spiraling &quot;Aerials&quot; and EVERY TRACK in between, &quot;TOXICITY&quot; has blown me away! I've found myself rather jaded lately, especially where new music is concerned, but System Of A Down have been my redemption. The sheer energy, raw power, blinding speed, shifting tempos and vocals courtesy of the Astounding Serj Tankian make this easily one of the most innovative and stunning heavy metal LP's ever released. I could easily ramble on and on about the group's political stance (they're Armenian and have plenty to vent about) but since the brutal directness of Tankian and Guitarist Daron Malakian's lyrics need no interpretation, I can just sit back and enjoy the dizzying ride. After the gorgeous ballad &quot;Spiders&quot; from their 1998 debut, I seriously wondered if these guys could top themselves, silly me! The group blows away all doubt with the multi-layered, shapeshifting &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, probably their finest moment on record so far, though &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; is pretty darn close. &quot;TOXICITY&quot; is and endlessly fascinating listen.
B000003TAW|5.0|So many artists and groups today put out CD's that have maybe 1 or 2 big hits, and the really good ones put out an album with perhaps 5 or 6 very good tunes.  The collection of songs on the Blue CD, however, does not fall to this \\"standard.\\"  Every song on the album has a soul, making it the only CD I've ever listened to which has a flawless tracklist!<br />I'll now be breaking each song down with a quick summary of what makes it so great, as well as a rating of the track.<br />1. MY NAME IS JONAS - This song has a beautiful introduction, helping to ease into the Blue CD; then in the Weezer fashion, it blasts into a very catchy rock, with lyrics that can only be described as comically deep.  This song is perfect as the first track on the list, however it won't likely be the one you find yourself humming later on after listening to the whole album.<BR>--Rating:  8.5/10<br />2. NO ONE ELSE - This song opens quickly.  Lots of guitar.  Lots of fun.  Rivers takes a song that would be otherwise bland and turns it into a hit.  The words are hilarious and this song WILL get stuck in your head.<BR>--Rating:  9/10<br />3. THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME HERE - Of all of the tracks on this album this is probably the one you'd have to put in last place.  Although it is still a very good song, it seems very lack-luster compared to the other material on the CD.<BR>--Rating: 7/10<br />4. BUDDY HOLLY - Probably the second most famous track on the album, Buddy Holly pays tribute to the 50's star, and does him justice too.  It's a fast-paced, all-too-catchy, well-written piece.  Many who listen to the Blue Album would label this as their favorite song on the CD.<BR>--Rating: 8.5/10<br />5. UNDONE (THE SWEATER SONG) - This radio hit can still be heard on rock stations today, and it deserves the spotlight as the major hit song of the CD.  We all know the words and we all can't help but keep a permanent place in our hearts for this song.<BR>--Rating: 9.5/10<br />6. SURF WAX AMERICA - This is one of my personal favorites of any Weezer song to date.  The words are nothing spectacular, but the pure \\"enjoyability\\" of the tune more than makes up for it.  This is probably one of the most famous surfing songs written.<BR>--Rating: 9/10<br />7. SAY IT AIN'T SO - Although my favorite band is not Weezer, my favorite song of ANY group or artist is Say It Ain't So.  Is that saying a lot?  Oh yes.  My friends and I all agree that this beautiful song will always be the best Weezer song... ever.<br />--Rating: 10/10<br />8. IN THE GARAGE - The cult following behind this song would preach it as the best song of any Weezer album, and rightly so.  The harmonica and acoustic guitar blend perfectly in this song, and the grungy sound of the chorus makes this song all-too-lovable, (not to mention the crazy-awesome guitar solo!).<BR>--Rating: 9.5/10<br />9. HOLIDAY - This song rocks.  What else can I say?  Its radio-worthy tune and lovable lyric make it one of the shining hits of the Blue CD.  This song will also get stuck in your head.<BR>--Rating: 10/10<br />10. ONLY IN DREAMS - The unsung hero of the Blue Album, my friend once compared this song to sex; it starts off great, builds and builds, until finally it's just all-over-the-place great!  This song is absolutely perfect as the conclusion to a remarkable CD.<BR>--Rating 9/10<br />This CD belongs in everyone's collection, if it's not already there.<BR>That'll do, Weezer.  That'll do.
B00005JKN9|1.0|This is a film that I regret watching until the finish.  I am the kind who CANNOT stop a movie no matter how bad.  I just have to finish it to see if it will redeem itself.  This did not happen.  I was expecting historical drama mixed with fiction as well as some violence.  But, this was just unnecessarily bloody.  It was obvious that the envelope was being pushed here just to grab response.  I find that's usually required if there is not enough of a storyline to compensate.  The actors did well.  The storyline had so much potential, but too much emphasis on trying to create a &quot;realism&quot; which comes across as just being plain gory and hard.  I thought Bravehart was a gory movie, but good.  This is no Bravehart.
B00002E224|5.0|This is a truly stunning movie. There is nothing I can say that has not already been said here.  I get almost as much pleasure from reading these reviews as I do from watching every scene of this beautiful, unforgettable film. This film has touched so many lives. Having lived in France and had similar experiences, this love story really resonates with me. And, guess what fans, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have signed up for the sequel! I would be nervous about a sequel ruining this work of art, if the effort were not in the hands of Delpy, Hawke, and Linklater.   I'm sure they will take good care of this treasure.  The leaks about the sequel are already hinting at a careful, realistic continuation of the story.  For example, Celine and Jesse do NOT meet 6 months later on the platform (of course not!).  They meet again by chance 7 or 8 years later in France, with Jesse on a promotional tour for his new book. Looks like Paris with be the backdrop city (wow!), as filming begins there in Fall 2003.  We can expect that 7 years will have likely raised some barriers to renewed intimacy.  I'm expecting Celine to be deep in another relationship, and Jesse ... well, we'll see.  I'm hoping for a few twists, like maybe Celine DID go back in 6 months -- 1 day early in fact because she wan't sure about the date, and waiting three days in the damn snow for Jesse, who never showed up. Can you imagine her bitter train ride back home to Paris on the Rejection Express?  Now there's a barrier for the 7-year-older Jesse to get over.  But most of all, I'm looking for more magic that will compare to the listening booth, the trolley Q and A, the pinball game, and &quot;ring ring, pick up!&quot;<BR>(By the way, Delpy fans, don't miss &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;.  Julie is charming, the comedy works beautifully to temper the well-worn vampire theme, and the flying prophylatic cafe scene, and Julie's deadpan expression, is worth the price of the disk!)
0553212737|5.0|After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read more of of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &#34;tangle&#34; of plot than Pride & P/Sense & S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &#34;heroines&#34; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader. I highly recommend reading this masterpiece.
B0000549B2|4.0|This is one of the most visually beautiful film with African-American actors I've ever seen (another that comes to mind is Devil in a Blue Dress, also starring Denzel Washington).  The opening credits are a masterful combination of music and shadows.<BR>Overall, an enjoyable contemporary story of young, single African-Americans filmed in Brooklyn and Manhattan, a rarity for its time.  They're making more of this type of film today . . . but the actors are getting younger and younger!
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu's \\"Baduizm\\" (1997) is a strong first debut from a talented singer. I came across this album by accident, a friend borrowed my ride while I was on vacation and left the cd behind. Some of the tracks that stand out for me include: \\"On & On\\"  a relaxed soulful track with a mellow beat, Badu's vocals are addictive, the slow moving and powerful \\"Other Side of the Game\\" a track where Badu talks about a boyfriend whos in the game, and drops chorus of what you going to do when they come for you- they being the boys in blue. Really like both of these tracks, favourite goes to the first. Some more tracks I like include \\"Next Lifetime\\" where Badu addresses temptation, the simple but nice \\"4 Leaf Clover\\" and the somewhat sad \\"Drama\\". No tracks are bad on this release, though I would of liked to see some more tracks on it, considering I stumbled upon it I am glad to have it.I enjoy listening to \\"Baduizm\\" when I am kicking it with my girl. Recommend it to R & B lovers.
B000022TSW|5.0|Most people consider South Park a show/movie that is just pure sexual innuendo, fart jokes, gross out humor, and four letter words...and that is right on the money, but what they neglect to point out is the brilliant weaving of social ideals into the mix. \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" is an absolutely brilliant film that does something that most film makers would not dream about: creating a microcosm of itself. The seemingly ascinine plot (the boys sneak into an R-rated Canadian film, then, through a series of extremely comedic events, eventually ends in a war with Canada, thus unleashing the Appoclyps), is what they thought was going to happen when the movie was released (granted, vastly over blown for theatrical effect).<br />The movie itself is filled with side splitting humor and one-liners galor! Never leaving a dull moment open. To the addition of the genius of it, the fact that they made it a musical just upped the ante. With songs like \\"La Resistance (Medley)\\" (sung by the entire cast) and \\"I Can Change\\" (sung by Saddam Hussein) the movie is just incredible. The role of \\"Mr. Garrison\\" is remnisant of Jonny from \\"Airplane!\\", even resurecting spome old and brilliant jokes that were slightly changed from the aformentioned movie. The portayal of Satan in this movie is VASTLY DIFFERENT than any other portrayal I have ever seen. Satan is shown as a kind hearted homosexual in an up and down relationship to lover Saddam Hussein. Such entertaining happenings as that fill the movie. Look, whether you want a solid piece of cinema to disect and enjoy, or a gross out, offensive comedy that is pure fun you need to pick this up this movie, you will not soon regret it.
B00005JLTN|5.0|This Movie is good and People I understand your feelings, but wait for the last movie where the 2nd movie will be understood. I love this movie I know the ending ended all of sudden, but the 3rd movie will explain everything. Besides It has great action sense. My favortite part is where Carrie Anne- Moss with the bike and key maker was amazing. Wait for the 3rd movie.
0790733226|4.0|the movie's great... it's only downfalls i would say were that it was a bit lengthy and that matthew's character could have been more dynamic... but you should watch it just to see william fichtner as kent clark, the blind guy! he's an awesome actor and this was the part that really seemed to get him noticed. yeah... i like him a bit.
B000008GAC|5.0|I can certainly say that Gn'R's appetite is the best album ever recorded:<BR>Put the best musicians on their fields: such as Slash and Izzy on guitars, Axl on singing, and a very original and great rhythm section by Steve and Duff.<BR>Make them write the best songs they can: Fast (You are Crazy), heavy (Welcome to the Jungle), melodic (Sweet Child O' Mine), bluesy (My Michelle), angry (Out ta Get Me), hard (Nightrain), pouding (It's So Easy), experimental (Rocket Queen) and exciting (My Michelle).<br />Write the best lyrics for this songs: true and real lyrics, talk about the streets (Welcome to the Jungle), drugs (Mr. Brownstone), sex (Rocket Queen), all what rock n' roll is really about. <BR>Get the best presentation for the album, the best producer, and you get the best recording you can for a rock n' roll band.<br />THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL!<br />Highlights: All<BR>Low points: It's only an hour long... Wish it was 3 or 4...
B00003ETOW|1.0|This version of Jane Eyre does not leave much of Bronte's book. The character of Jane Eyre is received as a smiling Hollywood star and does not reflect anything of her Lowood history which is so splendidly done in the Zefirelli version. I would never be induced to read the book after seeing this movie.<BR>Watching the movie is waste time even if one likes to compares the different movie versions!
6305313687|5.0|The movie's whole point roles together at the very last scene. The movie's point is where Racism gets you. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are Incredible. I thought Edward Furlong could act when I saw him in Detroit Rock Ciry, they are just phanominal. And since I'm a real punk I'm against racism. An easy way to see it (in my eyes) racism equals nazi. nazi equals government, therefore I hate it.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I wasn't quite expecting this, what with i'm a slave 4 u and boys, etc. etc.<br />My favorite is definitely Overprotected.  It's catchy, it's cool, it's just plain great.  I kept singing till my mom got annoyed!<br />  Anyways, Overprotected, Not a girl, Not yet a woman,  Bombastic Love, and i love rock and roll are the best!<BR>in my opinion( different can think differently), boys and i'm a slave 4 U don't deserve all the the praise they've gotten.  It's all about her shooting [physica] themes at you every few seconds( britney doesn't even sing in this one, all she does is whisper)<br />Though I am a big fan of Britney's, I still like her 1st and 2nd album better, in general( overprotected is awesome).  It's good to hear her really sing in Not a Girl, Not yet a Woman.  She won't be the next Madonna, her looks give her most of the credit.  Some of her songs are AWESOME, but I'm afraid this album doesn't make the cut.  <br />I'll give her 4 stars for her efforts in proving herself to be more mature.  I'm all for Britney!
B00005JKZV|5.0|He took one of the most envoled, detailed seris of books  ever and faithfully brought them to the silver screen.  With legions of diehard fans ready to judge hims this was no easy task. As long time fan of the bools i have to say I'm very satisfied with this movie and I hope the Return of the King is as good as this one.
B000084T18|2.0|Let's face it, anyone who has heard the 50 cent album will know that it is nothing spectacular. The beats are tight (naturally, since it was Dr. Dre and Eminem). Besides the beats, this album is wack!!! I bought it expecting to hear something to blow me away, but i was extremely dissapointed. Though i liked the track Patiently Waiting because of Emimen's wicked rhymes and his mad flow, i also liked Don't Push Me, because of Eminem's and LLyod Bank's masterful touch. But let's face it, 50 can NEVER be the next best thing. Besides his unique voice, he has just one thing that's appealing and that's his producers. Thumbs down to 50 cent on this one.
B000092ZYX|4.0|A couple of years ago I was a big Radiohead fan. I absolutely loved (and still do) &quot;OK Computer&quot;, &quot;Kid A&quot; (which took a few listens to grow on me), &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, &quot;The Bends&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. Since then my music tastes has changed. I have developed a fondness for darker and heavier music. My preoccupation with Radiohead has diminished quite a bit. I wasn't sure whether to get the band's latest effort &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot; until I found a used copy of it today. Now while no cd can ever compare to &quot;OK Computer&quot; or &quot;The Bends&quot;, I expected &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; live up to the hype that always surrounds Radiohead's music. Unfortunately, I did not find &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; anywhere near the brilliance that some critics made it out to me. After hearing &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, I missed the abstract ambient influences of &quot;Kid A&quot;. On the more positive note, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; manages to create a delicate, if not intricate sound. There is still the ambient beats from the band's previous efforts but it isn't nearly obvious. There is a more rock &amp; roll sound to the music but nowhere near &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; or &quot;The Bends&quot;. I did enjoy the cd. There were some solid songs on &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, I just didn't think that it was Radiohead's best album to date. Maybe because of my ever changing tastes in music. &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; isn't bad, just doesn't live up to the hype.
B00006690F|5.0|This album has got it. Eminem really captivates the listener with his wicked rhymes and versatility in music. He takes us to a side of Marshall we've never seen. It's not the usual &quot;I HATE N'SYNC! I HATE BACKSTREET BOYS!&quot; It is a deeper better and more appealing album than Marshall Mathers LP. I definitely would buy it if i was you. DEFINITELY
B00007KLJJ|4.0|Really enjoyed renting this movie. Rented it because the jacket and story line was interesting. After looking at some of the other reviews, I checked to see if I watched the same movie. Perhaps I enjoyed it so much because I had rented some duds recently. Sound: pretty good, bullets zip from back to front speakers. Picture quality: very good, desert scenes are beautiful. Story: good - coward tries to regain his dignity. Would have liked to know the characters better. Think this could have helped the movie. Characters: Djimon Hounsou is great as the slave helping our hero. This would be a great movie for you to rent because of the extreme different opinions expressed in these reviews. I saw it, enjoyed it, and will probably purchase a used one from Amazon.com in the future. ...
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm not going to be a jerk and say that people who turn their nose up at this album don't \\"get it,\\" since it's obvious that there are some very intelligent people who are just turned off by Radiohead's newer material (OK Computer seems to bet the cut-off point for many).  They are more interested in the flat-out rock, and aren't as impressed with the mellower, more electronic--in some ways, much darker--Radiohead.  The effects-laden instruments, restless programmed beats, twinkling clicks and swirling hums found here are footprints down the road less traveled, and the departure from \\"normal\\" rock patterns just grates on some folks.  Different strokes, ya know?<br />Speaking of the emergent technology they're incorporating:  True, that digital sonic flourish is found all over this album, but rather than letting tweaked samples take over the tracks (Amnesiac comes to mind), they manage to bring it to a level that completely trancends cold electronics.  The samples never tyrannize the other instruments, and they are not there to simply fill in gaps like aural spackle.  Everything is placed with great care and written to work within context.  The sound field is so rich, so dense with texture, you can explore each track over and over again and still come away satisfied.  As should be expected, the production on this album is ... astonishing.<br />Personally, I think this is Radiohead's strongest album yet.  They've been making great leaps in songwriting, structure and content since the beginning.  This is to be expected as the band matures together--but let's face it, you can't say the same thing about most acts out there these days.  I admit, there have been a few flat spots, but they never stop fearlessly pushing it all forward.  That being said, it is true that this album is more than a casual listen, and will probably require repeated sittings for it all to sink in completely.<br />It irks me when people dismiss this album based solely on the title.  This is hardly what I would call leftist agitprop, though if you wanted to interpret it that way, you could--but not without some effort.  The lyrics are included in the liner notes, and don't really give away much.  Like most Radiohead, they are akin to abstract art; it's not neccisarily about what it *means*, but how it makes you *feel* that's most important.<br />On that note--I say with a small chuckle, this is NOT happy music.<br />I highly recommend this album.
B0000019HU|5.0|i'm sure it's been said already many a time, but this is an amazing, underappreciated album...the tracks can stir up so many emotions at once, fear, saddness, hope, congering images both intensely beautiful and horrific...it's sad to see &quot;emo&quot; music today, so much of it was copped off the louisville bands and just diluted...but this is real, this is raw, this is true...finding this cd a few years ago almost single-handedly restored my faith in music again...
6303471714|5.0|I think that this video is great. There is a variety of scenes she works out in, variety of colors. The music needs a bit of work, though. The actual workout really tones your muscles and if it is your first time, you will be sore the next day. The breaks for drinks of water are important and you are given enough time to take them. The exercises are straight forward normal, gym exercises. I recommend this to any one. She even allows you to work with in your limit. Although she works at the peak most of the time. Very important if you are overwieght or out of shape.
B00009ATKS|4.0|i have been a huge mogwai fan for a while now, and was very excited for their latest release...it pushes the more subdued aspects mogwai showed on the mogwai ep and rock action...very tranquil, little of the danger of earlier mogwai, i.e. young team album, remains (i remember sweating through my clothes, waiting for the guitars to come crashing down on young team's 2nd track)...so at first I had trouble getting into it, it definitely took a few listens for me to &quot;get&quot; the album...i wouldn't rate it as high as come on die young or young team, but it's definitely up there...a good &quot;mellow&quot; mogwai record...
B00008DDXC|3.0|After that many adult friends recommended me to watch &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and considering all the scandal this movie has produced, I decided to see the movie (two years after its appearance)...<BR>The special effects and the imaginative ground, I think, are great: great sound effects, moving images in pictures, talking letter, flying cars... However, I did not like the movie. The plot is not centered into something substantial; it does not make a strong ethical, humoristic or mysterious statement which makes it somewhat mild. For a kid I think that the movie is good; however, for an adult (many of my mid 20 friends are fans of Harry Potter) it could be not-so-interesting. The only part that of the movies that I liked lies in a idea about determination to do whatever we want: when Harry Potter and Professor Dubledore discuss that Harry should have been in another school instead of Gryffindorf, but that his determination rewarded what he really wanted.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Fantastic record.  Along with Carla Werner's &quot;Departure&quot;, one of the two best records of the year.

B00009P1O2|5.0|Freddie Mercury is mesmerizing.  Queen is one of the best bands of all time and this DVD proves it.  Highly recommended.
B000003TAW|5.0|When I first got into weezer I bought the green album first before anything else. I thought it was good, but when I got Weezer's self titled debut also known as the Blue Album, Weezer quickly became one of my favorite bands. This debut album is amazing, and I don't think anyone who likes Weezer can deny that fact. It is also my favorite Weezer album, with Buddy Holly and Only In Dreams being my favorite songs. This is an amzing album and because of this got Weezer into the forefront of rock music as we know it today. =w= for life.
B00005JMCR|4.0|The American Pie films may be laced with toilet humor(which it does so well),but they stand out due to the characters being so likeable and the stories having a heart.<BR>  AW(dealing with the wedding between newly college grads Jim & Michelle), most likely the last in the trilogy,is not entirely fresh,but still manages to make you laugh and smile.Steven Stifler(Sean William Scott, who basically steals the movie)rates high on the obnoxious meter,but you still have to love the guy as even he grows up towards the end of the movie.<BR>  Jason Biggs' Jim Levenstien(one day a pop culture icon for geeks)still knows how to get into a crazy situation(The opening dinner scene,his pre wedding \\"haircut\\"),and Alyson Hannigan's Michelle shows how a one time flute-toting band geek can blossom into a beautiful young woman.<BR> Even before I saw the movie,the biggest disappointments were the abscence of the girls (Mena Suvari,Tara Reid,Natasha Lyonne)who made the first two movie so great.Equally missed is Chris Klein's Oz which throws off the chemestry between Jim,Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas<who is pretty much non-existant in the movie>).Although Eugene Levy's portrayal of \\"Jim's Dad\\" is still a favorite among fans.Even Chris Owen's \\"Sherman-ator\\" would've been a welcome presence.<BR>  Though the formula's been sitting out for a while,American Wedding shows that some \\"Pies\\" are still consumable before it goes stale.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I can't believe that anyone would give this cd 4 stars.  This is a brilliant collection of music.  Although I love &quot;old&quot; radiohead, all of the later albums are a work of art different and beyond the older stuff.  If someone had never before listened to radiohead, I would recommend Kid A, Amnesiac, and Heil to the Thief first!  Listening to this music is an adventure for the mind and soul.
B00005JMCR|5.0|This movie is so friggin halarius. It is definity the best of the series. Stifler is one of the main characters in this one, hes funny as hell. Th nude scene is the best one yet... This is the funniest movie u have ever seen and sean william scott is the funniest actor in this movie. GO SEE THIS MOVIE ITS FUNNY AND AWSOME!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Thoughtful story arcs, real people who were growing and expanding into delightful (and sometimes frightening) characters.  Adventure. Romance. Science fiction and a little touch of westerns all rolled up into one great show I was VERY happy to have stumbled across - and then just as I began a fanatic FOX cancelled the show.  Reminds me of a premature Star Trek from Paramount only FOX has a track record of not going back and reviving titles even when they are successful ...<br />If you enjoy Science Fiction this is a must own and even though it's only 1 season there's enough there to be worth seeing.  Nuff said
0385509456|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a great read, an empathetic look at autism, and a more-true-than-not representation of the complexity and unpredictability of family life. It just isn't a great novel. For all the attention paid to the workings of Christopher Boone's consciousness, the book remains more pretified documentary than literary creation. The maths and Sherlock Holmes references are a case in point. They provide a lively backdrop and interesting reading material, but they never seem to gell into a new force for Christopher--they never progress beyond the interesting behavior stage into something larger, something that truly changes Christopher's life and our own. So although the novel isn't heavy or moralistic; neither does it ever go beyond satisfying storytelling. Don't get me wrong; I couldn't stop reading. It's just that somehow, what i was reading never seemed to add up to something more.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Good Album for a long, rainy night when you cant sleep &amp; want to relax &amp; wind down from a hard day. No, I'm not saying it'll put you to sleep! Just relax you enough when you need it most.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two towers, the second installment in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series, based on the masterpiece by J.R.R Tolkien, is the best movie I have ever seen,it pretains the emotion and depth of the book while also full of fantastic surprises. I saw this movie nine times and can't wait to see the extended edition and the next instalment, the Return of the King. The movie is about holding on to each other in the face of evil. The movie begins with Gandalf the grey falling with the Balrog and moves on to the explosive conclusion of the battle for Helm's Deep, in which the men of Rohan are pitted against the merciless, Hate filled army of Saruman the White. Aided by the wizard Gandalf and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. The movie ends on the positive note that friendship and sticking together through hard times no matter how small you are is very imporatnt. i suggest if you haven't seen this epic wonder of a movie you should. YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!

B000084T18|5.0|Overrated, underrated, NOT rated?  Written and spoken by the same people over and over again.  HATERS.  No wonder why he wrote 'Many Men'.<br />I don't care how many people say he's a sellout, you got to give the man credit.  Now, how many rappers nowadays can spit &quot;What up Blood?&quot; on a record and get away with it?  Hmm...that's what I thought.  His lyrics?  Real.  His demeanor?  Stylistic.  The beats?  Dope.  And you won't believe how many people are trying to imitate him now.  Fine if he's an influence, but don't try and claim you're him.  Not gonna fly.<br />Best track?  I couldn't give you one.  This is one CD in my collection where I can truly say I can listen to it the whole way through and not change one song.  Closing in the words of 'Patiently Waiting'--if you think he's a f***in' falloff, you're so wrong.
B00003CX8J|4.0|First of let me say that this is a mere classic only because it delivers astonishing visual display it is truely the turning point of visual arts of the year 2000 as you may or may have not noticed that after x-men was was filmed that 2 years later spider-man came out then followed by daredevil then the sequel that passed the original X-Men) (X-Men 2) then the most special effects of them all (HULK) but to my point X-men is a great film it captures the true spirit of a diffrent world a world full of muntants that are hated among the citizens of the untied states yet the muntants still confront the humans in order to help but a evil muntant named magneto forms a brothurhood of muntants to bring evil opon the citizens this is a great action film with noticeable marvel characters such as Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm etc. all in all great film must buy 4- stars
B00008K7AM|5.0|It's just a very2 great movie to watch!! Very2 funny... <BR>Rob Schneider is playing great in this movie! If you haven't seen it, you should or should I say, must see it! You'll definitely love it if you like comedy ^_^
B00004BZ0N|1.0|From London Calling to train in vain, i am ashamed to hear that this band were the definite uk punkers. These guys rely on catchy tones rather than playing their hearts out. To find the REAL definite UK punkers, listen to the sex pistols
B000002OX5|5.0|A concept album can be defined in many ways. Some people consider the Beatles landmark Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as a concept album, while others point at the storybook theme of the Who's Tommy. Often overlooked in both the concept album catalog and the Who's catalog is their 1967 release Who Sell Out, a pastiche of sorts revolving around a mock pirate radio broadcast.<br />The first thing a listener will notice about the album is its hilarious cover and back cover. Photos of the Who members shamlessely plugging Odorono deodorant (Townshend), Heinz Baked Beans (Daltrey), Medac zit cream (Moon), and Atlas muscle enhancer (Entwistle) mock the seriousness of true ad campaigns. It shows that the Who are not just &quot;selling out&quot; by being spokesmen, but are humorizing the process of &quot;selling out&quot; by being so straight-faced with it. The music in this album encapsulates that belief and shows that the Who KNEW how to &quot;sell out&quot; better than any band in the history of rock and roll.<br />Three  of the four products shilled on the cover photos have their own songs, or extended jingles, on the album. The best of the bunch is &quot;Odorono,&quot; a tune about a singer rejected of a contract because her armpits smelled. &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot; is an over-the-top jingle, complete with horns and campy voice-overs. &quot;Medac&quot; is Entwistle's tale of a boy whose face became &quot;smooth as a baby's bottom&quot; due to the zit cream. <br />Those three jingles are just a few of the many &quot;breaks&quot; between action on the album. The Who bring out some bizzare Radio London identifaction jingles in between songs, and shill such products as Rotosound Strings and hype the Radio Bingo show inside the grooves. <br />And them grooves! &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; (which is the benefactor of extraordinary juxtapositioning of the &quot;hold your group together&quot; jingle) is as tight as the Who can get and was the heaviest rock and roll got in 1967. &quot;Our Love Was&quot; (preceeded by a angelic Radio London religion ad) is a beautiful hint of Tommy's balladry. &quot;Rael,&quot; the album closer, is in two parts, and has an epic feel without being too showy (it contains a foreshadow of Tommy with a familiar rif). This is one of the first hints of Townshend's creative muscle.<br />Townshend is extensively creative with this album, in that, you can envision this being a legitimate radio show. The Who attempt to take on different styles of music, from the true psychedelic experience of &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot; to the folkish tint of the lovely &quot;Sunrise&quot; to the Beatlesque &quot;Mary Anne with the Shaky Hand&quot; to the light guitar pop of &quot;Tattoo.&quot; Though concept of the pirate radio show fades starting with Entwistle's &quot;Silas Stingy&quot; (due to record execs. rushing the LPs release), the Who manage to pull off a delightful list of songs and jingles that leave the listener satistfied and in a bouncier mood.<br />The extra songs on the re-released CD version of &quot;Who Sell Out&quot; decodes a few spare songs that the Who recorded during the sessions for the album. The songs for the most part are midtempo songs with good Who harmonizing, but feature nothing too out of the ordinary, which is why these songs probably stayed away from the original LP. &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; features a very familiar rif, however, and there are a few unused jingles about John Mason car sales and Coca-Cola within the songs. &quot;Glow Girl,&quot; though, is the most interesting of the extra songs, for it is a pure taste of the Who's next ambitious step...Tommy. <br />Who Sell Out is a must-have for Who fans and fans of pop music in general. The band is at their funniest here, and the songs reflect the mood of psychedelic Britain. If Sargeant Pepper were a full concept, this album may have been it.

0312265859|5.0|One of the best plum books.  There was enough action, laughs, and sexual content to make the book fun.  I was worried because seven was a little drab.  I hope she keeps up all the fun.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|I find the set of Rowam Atkinson's movies rather slapstick so this movie was a pleasant surprise.  Being from England myself I tend to prefer English humour but my friend who is American went with me and we both laughed all the way through the movie. I enjoyed it so much that I would love for a sequel to be made.  I refuse to see Austim Power's but thought this Johhny English movie was a must see.  It was a great afternoon spend at the movie and I would love to watch it again.
0385504209|5.0|This book is truly one of the most interesting, best written books I have ever read. The historicial facts can be taken with a grain of salt but the theories behind the novel are very interesting. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves looking at religion in different ways!
B00004SYWZ|2.0|A-ha is not just 'synth-pop' band of 80s. I really love their 1st (with a little bit excess of 80s' feel) and 2nd (more matured, enjoyable effort. My favorite A-ha album. And jacket is amazingly beautiful too). Then, later releases have not been very interesting. Then after 7 years, this came out. I decided to give a shot due to all enthusiatic reviews here. <BR>BUT, well, i don't really want to say I was disappointed. Just get their debut and 2nd CD. They are really great. What I get from this new release were a sequence of all similar tempo, all identical mood songs. I am a serious music lover. I'd give a repeated listen to find out something from the band who I like. Nothing came to me. Also I hate their drum sound/playing (to me, weak point of their music generally. I hate it. Dry and no excitement). Overall it sounds like they are lost and strangely came back to 90s ehh, modern rock style (and sometimes Morten sounds like Bono), instead of advancing to new century. Again, I strongly recommend you to pickup their 1st and 2nd. Then you may consider more adventure.
B00009ATIX|4.0|George Clooney plays Dr. Chris Kelvin, a shrink, who embarks on an &quot;adventure&quot; to Solaris to find out why communications have been lost with the last crew.  What he ends up finding is a secret that the planet Solaris reveals....that it brings dead loved ones back to life.  Steven Soderbergh does a great job with the directing of this movie by rarely switching camera angles to give this movie a creepy yet, interesting look.  All in all, a great performance put on by Clooney as always and some excellent music to accompany him.  It starts off slow, it gets you involved 20 minutes later and leaves you with tons of questions when it's over.
0066214122|5.0|I don't know why I read his books anymore. Maybe I still hope for something great, like Andromeda Strain.<br />Take Jurasic Park, but substitute &quot;little&quot; for &quot;big,&quot; and &quot;nanomonster&quot; for &quot;dinosaur.&quot; There you have it. You could figure it out by about page 10.<br />There is one positive though: it was way better than Timeline!
B00000JCB2|2.0|Sounded great at first, but now.......I just dont like it anymore, its just so trendy. There really isnt any meat, it reminds me of glam metal. No real feeling, just picked a market, and made songs to fit the market.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is the album that changed metal from the mamby-pamby make-up wearing, spandex clad colon cowboys, to music for males that have a pair. The first song co-written by Dave Mustaine, I Truly never liked much, the rest of the album can only be surpassed by the Master of Puppets album.
B00005JMC6|5.0|As an anthropology fan, a movie fan and a New Zealand fan this film won on all levels.  I re-read the book and was again moved by the power of myth and storytelling. I will buy the video when it is issued. I've never met anyone who visited NZ who wouldn't go back for more and this film shows part of the reason for that.<BR>Of course the film is not the book, but a book is not a live performance, nor a reading, nor a conversation. If you have not seen this movie, you have missed something. If you have seen it you have been introduced to myth, to characters, to storytelling, to the Maori people. It is a brief introduction. You will want to know them better. For reading try Whale Rider's author Witi Ihimaera and Maurice Shadbolt. Shadbolt's work includes the South Pacific version of America's westward expansion. His \\"Season of the Jew\\" about the Maori wars of the late 1800s is epic movie material.
B00005221M|3.0|This movie, IMHO, could have been drastically improved, if they had actually tried to find someone to advise the director on the reality of living and hunting in the woods. Chasing an Elk on foot? oh yeah, that happened all the time. Just whipping a flintlock off of your back and firing it in the rain? Oh yeah, that happened too. Why they ever invented the percussion cap rifle I will never know. In order for the audience to get into the charecters, they have to identify with them, and find their situation believable. That is where this movie missed its mark.<BR>Otherwise, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is done well.
B000002JNN|5.0|~My Breakdown of the songs~<BR>1. Thunderstruck - This song is different, but it is awesome.  It has an awesome melody. &quot;This is a prime example of ac/dc's riff driven side&quot; 5/5<br />2. Fire your guns - Rocking begining.  Good bassline and a fast paced song.  FIRE! 3.8/5  <br />3. Moneytalks - &quot;The intro guitar riff morphs into a giddy, sing-along choruses more infectious than a dose of &quot;the jack&quot;.&quot;  Nice guitar playing.  Good chorus and a good song. 5/5<br />4. The Razor's edge - Interesting song.  Very mysterious.  It sounds good.   4/5<br />5. Mistress for christmas - &quot;Not exactly frosty the snowman&quot;.  That's a good thing though. Rocking song. 4.5/5<br />6. Rock your heart out - Rocking song with good bassline.  5/5<br />7. Are you ready - Not a wonderful beggining but it gets really good.  Great chorus mostly. 4/5<br />8. Got you by the balls - Great beggining. Very good song.  5/5<br />9. Shot of love - Brothers Young truly doing their job here.

B00005V9IL|5.0|Director James Cameron sends us on a sci-fi adventure under the ocean!<br />  Under the ocean, Buddy runs an underwater mining rig.  The rig drills for oil for a company.  Soon the rig is ordered to look for a downed submarine, and a couple of SEALs is sent to the rig  (along with the one-time wife of Buddy)  to help look for the submarine.  Coffee (The leader of the SEALs) goes crazy and vows to destroy the  &quot;russian boogey&quot; that is being sighted around the downed submarine.  A good sci-fi adventure, although the ending is a little weak.
B000003CMB|5.0|Try taking four songs old as the hills, two of your own songs that you stretch out to an average of three times their original length, with only one new original song and try making an album that your record company is willing to release.<br />I bet you can't. <br />With Duane Allman's leadership holding it all together, the drumming of Jaimoe and Butch Trucks keeps the music flowing, the bass of Berry Oakley keeps the bottom in melody, the guitar of Dickey Betts (albeit overshadowed) holds its own, and the soul of Gregg Allman adds great and unique vocals, organ and piano. <br />One of the greatest albums ever recorded.
B00005JLXE|4.0|The film itself gets three stars, but the value-added material included in the DVD release merits an overall higher rating for the whole package.<br />I'd not seen this film in the theaters, and I was certainly aware of all the unfavorable reviews.  That said, I purchased this DVD sight-unseen primarily for the Fuel and Evanescence music videos.  The 2-disc DVD set is very reasonably priced for what you get.  I won't list all the extras here because they are included with this product's listing and in about a hundred other customer reviews.  But any reservations I had about dropping the $$$ to buy this were alleviated by the wealth of bonus materials and that the film wasn't as terrible as I'd heard.<br />Granted, it is not a terribly exciting or engrossing film.  It feels like we've seen too many films just like it (except better) recently.  But at the very least it is very competently made, and Colin Farrell steals every scene he's in.<br />So if you are a fan of the bonus features that come with Special Edition DVD's, you could do a lot worse than to buy this selection.  &quot;Daredevil&quot; may not have been worth purchasing in a movie-only format, but the extra features more than make up for where the film disappoints, and then some.
B000003CMC|5.0|Imagine the pressure of having to complete an album without your group's leader- the one who held it all together, the linchpin of all of the sessions. 99.9 percent of all groups would falter, fade away and never be heard from again if what happened to the ABB on 29 October 1971 (and sadly again on 11 November 1972) happened to them. <br />No. Not the Brothers. Had Duane lived, I'm sure that the album would have been without the &quot;Fillmore, Pt. II&quot; material, but to have it there is having a great piece of live music. <br />&quot;Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Stand Back, &quot;Little Martha&quot;, especially &quot;Little Martha&quot; are all 5-star tracks by a group that didn't see what was just around the corner. &quot;Ain't Wastin' Time No More&quot;, &quot;Les Brers In A Minor&quot; and &quot;Melissa&quot; are all loving tributes to the spirit one young man from the South had. <br />Some might say, most might say that &quot;Eat A Peach&quot; has its problems, its weak points and so on, but not me. &quot;Eat A Peach&quot; is the greatest album ever recorded. Any CD collection without it is incomplete.
B00005JMCR|4.0|Loved the movie! If you enjoyed watching these kids grow up in the previous two \\"Pies\\", I guarantee you'll definitely be entertained by the final installment. I didn't really expect much because sequels usually aren't as great as their predecessors, but I ended up enjoying this one anyway. I found myself (and the entire crowd) laughing at most of the scenes, laughing so hard that it would be difficult to hear what they were saying during most scenes. Most of the comedy is pretty gross and sexual, which surprised me as to seeing many children under 15 with their parents/guardians were watching this movie together and actually seeing that these kids were laughing at these jokes. I would advise parents who want what's best for their children to leave them at home, or well, they'll find a way to watch it with their friends anyway.<br />Although Jim and the gang are back, there are a few cast members missing, such as Chris Klein, Mena Suvari, and Tara Reid just to name a few, but those that decided to film the last Pie certainly made it worth my time and money. I really enjoyed this movie and I would reccommend it to anyone, as long as they're not easily offended by crude humor. If you're familiar with the humor from the last two installments, and if you thought it was amusing, this is something you shouldn't miss watching this summer! Oh yeah, and watch out for the \\"truffle\\" scene with Stifler.
B000063UR2|2.0|&quot;Legend&quot; well it has some....NO THE BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS I'VE SEEN FOR AND OLD 80'S FANATSY FILM!!!...But if a movie's only Redeeming Quality is Good &quot;Special Effects and make up&quot; Than it is truly NO MOVIE AT ALL.And From What I've Seen &quot;The World Of Legend&quot; isn't much of a world at all.The Whole Movie seems Quite &quot;Compact.&quot; Their is only two places I've seen: a Forest(Where Jack Spends time with Lily.)And Those Deep underground caves where Darkness Dwells.Anyway,Deep Down In My Opinion This Is Like Watching Grass Grow, Compared To &quot;The Lord Of The Rings.&quot;(My Favorite Film of All time.)I mean There was Two Parts In &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;,That almost made me Cry!!!!(The Part Where Gandalf Dies,and Where Sam Shows That he is indeed a true Friend.)As For as Legend goes There's Not Any Part where I almost CRIED,Because I don't Even Care For The Characters!!!!Nor For The Movie Itself.This Movie (Like Rogert Ebert Said)Is Just Too Dark and Gloomy For Its Own Good.
B000002B1L|5.0|Ok, this was Nas's sophomore release following up the classic Illmatic. Every one of Nas's cds has a different feel or &quot;theme&quot; if you will. Now, It was Written has Nas adopting a thug image as Nas Escobar. You could tell just by the titles of the tracks that this was going to be a gangster album (&quot;Shootouts&quot;, &quot;Live Nigga Rap&quot;, &quot;Take it in Blood&quot; etc). The filler was very few and far between. This album deserves 4.5 stars. The '96 classic &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot; was Nas maybe trying to crossover, but who was complaining? No true hip hop fan could deny that song classic status. The other singles included &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;Street Dreams&quot; which were 2 stellar tracks that also supposedly sparked the &quot;beef&quot; with 2pac. Many underrated tracks follow those 2 stellar singles, especially the Primo produced &quot;I Gave You Power&quot;, where Nas metaphorically becomes a gun to show how he has been used in his past. I'm not sure why, but I really felt the song &quot;Take it in Blood&quot;; it just got me. The beat is nice and mellow while still retaining that hip hop feel. While most of the production is not as hard as it was on Illmatic, it is still remains stellar. &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; is another one of my favorite tracks where Nas explains the problems women bring upon themselves. The girls used to be innocent, but then they become wrapped up in the high life and the next thing they know they spin out of control. Very well crafted by Nas. &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; showcases the firm crew, very good track. Nas and AZ definitly wrote the best verses. &quot;Watch Dem N*ggas&quot; is a decent track, I liked the beat. Nas explains about the people you need to watch out for so you don't get stabbed in the back. Part of his thug image because when you are a gangster according to Nas, you would need to be watching all the time. As far as the other tracks go that I did not mention, &quot;Shootouts&quot; had a great beat and Nas's verses were good enough. The filler here, in my opinion, was &quot;Live N*gga Rap&quot; with mobb deep and &quot;Suspect&quot;. Not that those songs were bad, but they could have been cut out to make a 5 star album. Now I don't HATE thug rap, it all depends on who's doing it and how it's done. Although I liked this album a lot, this is not Nas's true style. This is not Nas at his best. Nas is at his best when he's discussing political, social and intellectual issues. Also when he's being true to himself and giving out personal tracks. Illmatic was a certified classic, no doubt about that. But Nas has grown and you can see that with this album, as well as his other albums.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|18 years after its original release in 1985, Dire Straits' &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; still stands as the band's best album. Mark Knopfler and Co. had made excellent albums prior to this one, but &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was when the pieces of the puzzle fell into seamless perfection. Knopfler displays his greatest songwriting here which has yet to be surpassed. His guitar work and Dylan-esque vocals as well as the musicianship between the band members and studios guests is inexpendable.<br />The hits &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Walk Of Life&quot; and of course &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; are now timeless classics which still recieve heavy airplay. In addition to these hits, the jazz-oriented &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot;, the epic &quot;Why Worry&quot; and the atmospheric title track are also worthy of being called classics.<br />This album still sounds as fresh and timeless as it did in 1985. It was also one of the first albums to be made specifically for the Compact Disc format (some of the album's longer tracks were edited on the vinyl LP). With its solid songwriting, musicianship and lyrics, it's still no wonder that &quot;Brothers In Arms&quot; captures the very best from Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. It's practically a Greatest Hits album all on its own. Still highly recommended after all these years.<br />I should add that the newly remastered CD gives this album a huge sonic boost and displays it in its best sound quality ever.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I have to tell you that when I first saw Fellowship of the Ring I was awestruck by the cinematograpy of that film. Seeing The Two Towers further drove my curiosity as to weather or not Peter Jackson could really make J.R.R. Tolkien's epics of Middle Earth come to life on the screen. You really get a feel for how urgent destroying the ring has become from how Frodo is almost taken by it many a time. The battle scenes in this film go beyond any battle scene that I've ever seen! (save Braveheart, The Patriot, and a few others) This film would be a great addition to any Tolkien fan's collection because of the content. Peter Jackson has taken MANY lines word-for-word from the book and has left out very little from any of the books. If you haven't seen it, skip renting it and take it home to be part of your collection. THE EXTENDED EDITION'S OF FELLOWSHIP AND TWO TOWERS WOULD BE THE IDEAL SET, AS IT PUTS A LOT OF DELETED/EXTENDED SCENES AND INFORMATION BACK INTO THE FILMS, TIEING THEM MORE AND MAKING A LOT MORE SENSE TO YOU IF YOU ARE NOT A TOLKIEN READER.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Although Moulin Rouge was and is an entertaining modern musical, Chicago has all the right \\"stuff\\" if you will. The actors are interesting, funny, and know how to keep an audience's attention.
0553573403|3.0|After reading the first 4 Harry Potters, Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia, I was still in a fantasy mood so I asked around and one common book came around : A Game of Thrones. Well I don't know why I listened to them but this wasn't that great a book.<br />The story begins rather slowly until the Hand of the King is murdered and one of the characters has an assasination attempt on him(he lives), and it's trying to figure out who killed him and for what purpose. Well you know what? After 400 pages, I didn't care. The writer uses a different method to chapters: each &quot;chapter&quot; is actually the point of view of a character and jumps to another character for the next. This is extremely irritating as the story will finally pick up then it goes to this boring person's perspective, then it finally goes back several chapters later but to find it's still boring. I didn't care for the character at all. All pompous and long winded and seemingly bitchy.<br />He is however a good describer and the POV idea is new to me but man this book is slow
B000069AUI|5.0|I absolutley love this CD. Chris Martin has an amazing and moving voice and the lyrics that he sings are evtremely meaningful. My favorite songs on the CD are &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, and &quot;Green Eyes.&quot; I would recommend this CD to anyone!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both had their share of mob related films: Al's Scarface, all 3 Godfathers and Donnie Brasco, and Robert's Casino, Goodfellas and Godfather Part 2. This is the first time they've been paired up and it's thrilling to see.<br />Robert plays Neil Mccauley, a highly intelligent thief who goes around and fine points every single &quot;hit&quot; or robbery. Al plays Vincent Hanna, an LA detective who's away from his wife and house making for some bad moments at home. One tries to tie up loose ends and leave the country with his new woman, the other tries to get enough evidence on the other to nail him.<br />One of the key scenes(and also a bit original in terms of crime stories) is when Neil and Vincent having a cup of coffee and just talking rather than trying to beat each other up. It plays nicely and it's new as usually when heroes and villians meet, it's always one trying to stop the other, but here it's more &quot;sooner or later I'm going to get you, it's not today but one day&quot; scenes. Another key scene is when a bank heist goes horribly wrong as the cops get tipped off and Neil, Chris(Val Kilmer) have to fight their way through a street in Los Angeles and escape. It's a big joy to see.<br />The ending however leaves me a little disappointed. The film ends in a big one on one showdown between Neil and Vincent then it just ends. But several characters you never figure out what happens to them or what they're gonna do but it's a great film with 2 classic actors squaring off
B000005J56|5.0|Awesome music.  Need I say more.  Yes.  Buy the video as well.
B000002VTE|5.0|If any 90s record deserves to be distinguished as the \\"modern Pet Sounds,\\" it is this one--it sounds wonderfully like a drugged-up space-jazz symphony written by an indie Brian Wilson, and it is unspeakably brilliant.<br />Jason \\"Spaceman\\" Pierce is one of rock's last true geniuses, a one-man musical army with more than enough talent to bring his interstellar-space rock ambitions to life.  On \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...\\", he channels \\"Smile\\"-era Beach Boys (the multi-tracked psychedelic harmonies of the title track), Primal Scream (the thick groove and gospel choir that drive \\"Come Together\\"), and even Miles Davis (the explosive jazz workouts that dominate the second half of the record).  And yet this rich amalgamation of sounds never sounds plagiaristic; it is one of the most original and engaging creations of the past decade.   <br />And while Pierce is a singular talent, this record is lifted to entirely new levels by the countless collaborations throughout--swamp blues pianist Dr. John even shows up on the epic, black pond of a song \\"Cop Shoot Cop...\\" (which even gets a lyrical lift from John Prine's \\"Sam Stone!\\").  The record does slide into pure cacophony on occasion, but even the mountains of white noise cannot detract from the record's heartbraking-gutwrenching-thrill-seeking-free-floating essence.  Besides being one of the absolute best space-rock records of all-time (it is probably better than even \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"), it is also a neo-psychedelic milestone and one of rock's true heartbreakers.  Forget \\"Kid A\\"--this is the best avant-garde experimental pop album ever made.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Simply put, fantastic music by fantastic musicians.  This DVD is simply stellar.

Another Interlude.<br />15.Switch 10/10 Great song! Love the rap by Left Eye.<br />16.Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes 10/10 Awesome. A very creative song they did with the guy from Outkast.
B00005JMCR|1.0|walked away feeling slightly disappointed ;(<BR>Seems to me that stifler tried way to hard to be crudly funny, thumbs down on his charater this time. was Hoping to find some of the same \\"wet your pants\\" laughing as the previous ones, and relized that the charaters may have out grown their high school antics. I'd say wait for the rental. Seen it, been there, and came home with a ticket stub.<BR>:(
B0000A14WB|3.0|The album is a classic.  The DVD-Audio is simply awful.  The idea of 5.1 and DVD-audio or SACD is \\"jaw dropping sound\\".<BR>After listening to the new dvd-audio that came out, it simply is inferior to the cd I bought back when it first came out on cd.<BR>Maybe a mono album should not be mixed in 5.1.<br />*****Update-  For some reason the DTS is superior to the dvd-v version and the dvd-audio version.  SO give that a shot
B00009W0U4|5.0|Here is a disturbing little film that I will honestly never watch again; yet deep in my heart I feel this is great filmmaking.  I knew absolutely nothing about this movie before seeing it on DVD other than it was supposed to be very controversial (This is the ideal way to view the movie,the little you know about the plot the better). I'm personally glade I didnt catch this at the movie theater because I feel this film works better viewed alone in the comfort of your home making the film even more shocking. If you have a stomach for graphic [physical contact]  /violence/situations definetly give this movie a chance because it's a film you wont soon forget.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Marvel Comics' \\"Man Without Fear\\" was a moderate box office hit in theaters (no SPIDER-MAN or X-MEN, it performed a bit better than BLADE, and did far better, profit-wise, than the dismal HULK), but it is a natural on video, where it's claustraphobic, dark story seems better suited. The tale of blind lawyer/masked Hell's Kitchen protector Matt Murdock, it gives Ben Affleck his best performance to date (why a mask seems to improve his acting, who knows?), but the film is stolen by Colin Farrell's WAY over-the-top villain, Bullseye, and Jennifer Garner, as the elusive and naturally sexy Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin is less successfully realized; while he has the height and bulk for the role, he is far less threatening than he seemed in THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, and his lack of menace makes his final confrontation with DD less impressive than Bullseye's.<br /><br />Just as Spider-Man is Marvel's parallel to DC's purely heroic Superman (meek nice guy with glasses becomes superhero, with elderly adopted guardians; works at a newspaper, and has a 'girlfriend' who prefers the superhero), Daredevil is a superpowered variation to the darker, more justice-driven Batman (his parent's death triggers a need for revenge; the police deny his existence, initially, although a reporter guesses his secret identity; he prowls at night, his goal being to rid the streets of scum and vermin). Both the first BATMAN and DAREDEVIL feature churches, prominently, in climactic scenes (DD's showdown with Bullseye, Batman's with Joker); BATMAN RETURNS and DAREDEVIL both feature leather-clad female ally/adversary/love interests who supposedly 'die' by film's end. The analogies were even more obvious in the original DD comic, in the sixties, when Daredevil's sonar-like senses were the result of intense training, and the technology of the Billyclub he carried, and not the later explanation of being blinded by radioactive chemicals that heightened his senses. The bottom line is, movie critics who complained that DD was just a minor league variation of SPIDER-MAN weren't paying enough attention!<br /><br />The CGI scenes of DAREDEVIL aren't quite as obvious as in SPIDER-MAN, which is a plus (having most of the acrobatics at night helps!), and director Mark Steven Johnson keeps the story moving, never allowing an occasional continuity lapse (Elektra and Matt's playground contest, which is pretty illogical, if Matt's trying to keep his powers secret!) from bringing the film down.<br /><br />All-in-all, DAREDEVIL is a winner, and has me looking forward to both the DD and Elektra sequels being planned!o complained that DD was just a minor league variation of SPIDER-MAN weren't paying enough attention!<BR> <BR>The CGI scenes of DAREDEVIL aren't quite as obvious as in SPIDER-MAN, which is a plus (having most of the acrobatics at night helps!), and director Mark Steven Johnson keeps the story moving, never allowing an occasional continuity lapse (Elektra and Matt's playground contest, which is pretty illogical, if Matt's trying to keep his powers secret!) from bringing the film down.<BR> <BR>All-in-all, DAREDEVIL is a winner, and has me looking forward to both the DD and Elektra sequels being planned!

B00007J4SI|5.0|Unfortunately, this cycle of Scriabin's complete piano music will be panned by many people solely on the basis of its barbaric piano sound. In my opinion, however, the piano Ponti uses on these recordings - whataver it is and whichever landfill he dug it out of - is one of the series' greatest merits. Finally there is a pianist willing to approach Scriabin's music outside of the Chopin box. The sound is rather like one of John Cage's \\"prepared pianos,\\" except that it is being used here in the service of legitamate music. It sounds like it is constantly being pushed beyond its physical limitations, producing a savage, hellfire-and-brimstone result. Another, obviously more conventional-thinking reviewer, had reservations about the scrapy, abrasive high end of this piano; when I first put the CD on and heard this, I felt like I finally understood what Scriabin was all about: madness, and lots and lots of fire.<br />There is much to recommend this set. It is cheap. It is (I believe) the only complete set of Scriabin's solo piano music (I refer to this five-CD set and its companion two-CD set of the sonatas). The two-CD set includes the posthumously published Sonata in Eb minor, which, while still accepting of such prelapsarian concepts as tonality, still manages to put a smile on my face. Ponti's playing is better than others have made it out to be: you just have to get past your prejudices about what piano music should sound like to hear it. This is just one of those recordings that makes its own rules and wins. Well worth the money.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard as all the elements of a good cd are all there. The cd has its soft and hard parts, the lyrics are at times amusing (Bounce) and at times meaningful (Chop Suey) and extremely well written. The band is fantastic and play some unbelievable music. The drummer is fantastic and the guitars and bass are absolutely awesome! The vocalist, Serj, has a fantastic voice and uses it in both a heavier way and a softer singing voice. <br />Every song on this album is perfect and this is one of those cd's where you can play the whole album over and over again without skipping a track. Some of the many highlights are Chop Suey!, Aerials, Toxicity, Bounce, Shimmy and Prison Song.
B00009UW0N|1.0|The extended version is 104 minutes. Look it up!
B00005JL96|5.0|I was extremely reluctant to view this film, but after constant pleading my seven year old brother made me sit down with him and watch it.  <br />I was UTTERLY amazed at how great Lilo and Stitch turned out to be!  I had no idea great movies like this were even being produced by Disney any longer.  It seemed for a while, that their talent and enthusiasm for making beautiful, heartfelt and amusing films had been zapped into some other dimension.  But man, is Disney back, and stronger than ever!<br />Lilo and Stitch is a quirky, short film that you want to never end.  Lilo and her older sister, Nani, who takes care of her younger sister after their parents are killed, are extremely relatable.  Lilo and Nani argue, like REAL siblings, but also like real siblings, the love they share is immense and unstoppable.  The love is communicated well across the screen.  The troubles both girls experience, with Lilo experiencing being outcast by the snot-nosed girls she longs to befriend, and Nani trying to keep Lilo and her life together and not have the social services take Lilo away from her, make you love each girl even more.<br />In this middle of this mess, an insane yet sentimental - eh, what shall we call him? - robot, named Stitch lands near Nani and Lilo's home.  After Stitch realizes that escape and returning to his home planet is not an option, he uses Lilo as a way to hide from police forces from his home planet that are set to kill him.  Stitch, is, after all, a menace to the planet equal to the amount a damage a say, nuclear bomb could do.  But Stitch grows tired of simply destroying things and finds his sentimental side, with the help of Lilo.<br />I fear I've already said too much.  I will stop here before I ruin the sweetness of the movie for you.  Anyone, regardless of age, gender or interests will love this film to pieces.

B000001E7T|5.0|For several years I have been waiting for PJ to repeat what she did with this album.  It simply has not happened.  I have decided to stop waiting and just remain forever thankful for what she did with To Bring You My Love.  This CD is absolutely brilliant; an impecable effort.  All the songs here have their own identity.  From the simplicty of the title track to the intensity of Long Snake Moan or the extreme coolness of C'Mon Billy.  The funny thing is that despite this diversity, the album remains a tightly-presented conceptual work, with its underlying sadness, its rage and its suggestive, provocative and evocative mood.  This CD marked an important part of my life and, not like other albums that affected me in a similar way, it has remained considerably modern, touching and surprising.  If you have never heard this CD, just get it.  It does not matter it is almost ten years old now.  It is basically one of the best things you can get for fifteen bucks.
B00005QXXO|5.0|&quot;Spinning Plates&quot; version on this live album absolutely blew me away.  I bought this to get &quot;True Love Waits&quot; on a CD, but this album could stand alone on &quot;Plates&quot;.  The more I listened to the &quot;Plates&quot; track the more emotional I became - and I'm fairly stoic.  That song moved me and gave me more respect for where Radiohead is going now.  Absolutely gorgeous piano ballad.<br />Oh, and the other songs are awesome too - and well translated.
B00005V9HA|5.0|In the way of horror movies, Re-Animator takes the 80's and completely flips its perception around.  H. P. Lovecraft's most prolific work, Brian Yuzna's All-Star cast, and Jefferey Combs' circulating evilness all combine to make the best horror movie of its decade.  Plus, Elite Entertainment throws in that second disc in the millenium edition just to satisfy our Re-Animator cravings.  Here's the basic synopsis of the movie:<br />Herbert West generates the most evil of all characters as he Re-Animates corpes from the very beginning.  Until he goes too far, by decapitating his Professor.<br />Through a series of tribulations, West destroys and Re-Animates time and time again.  His decapitated counterpart provides the comic relief and the &quot;new&quot; bad guyness.  With the most gory ending of all time (apart from Dead Alive), Re-Animator ends with the biggest BANG possible.<br />If you haven't seen Re-Animator, please do.  If you don't want to, I don't know whats wrong with you.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Most Cure fans probably admire this album now, or at least individual songs.  But you have to remember where things stood at the time.  The Cure had built up a rabid fan base into the 1980's, not merely because they had recorded a substantial body of quality works, but also due to their stage shows, which were powerful experiences, and still are.  So by the end of the decade the band had already carved out a place for itself in history, and had a devoted following.<br />On top of all that they released Disintegration, one of the best albums ever recorded by anyone, anytime.  The Cure faithful went off the deep end into pure adulation, and they're still at it today, one of the strongest and most longstanding relationships between a band and its fans, ever.  Disintegration is absolutely adored, people weep at the opening chimes, and for good reason, of course; I'm not a true believer, but I listen to it a couple times a month, at least - it's brilliant.  The problem was that Disintegration was so good, it was impossible for Smith to follow it up, how could he?  He had to live another decade to store up the emotions that poured out on Bloodflowers.  So Wish was viewed as a poppy sell out at the time by many.<br />Now, in hindsight, Wish stands tall as a solid collection of wonderful songs, that had Disintegration never existed, probably would have adored nearly as much by the faithful.  There are many solid gems here, songs that would be career highlights for a lesser composer than Smith.  It has always be an album buried by the mountainous impact of Disintegration, and the recently released Trilogy DVD ups the ante once again; but it deserves more respect than that, and as the years pass, may receive it.  It belongs in any collection.

1573228737|4.0|A story with gothic atmosphere, AFFINITY is set in 1875 London. The narrator, Miss Margaret Prior, is an upper class woman on the verge of turning 30, and when we become acquainted with her, she is making her first visit to Millbank Prison. She is to be the Lady Visitor-someone who comes to visit and motivate the pathetic denizens locked up for everything from petty crimes and prostitution to murder. Very quickly she becomes compulsively interested in a young woman, Selina Dawes, a spiritualist and medium in jail for harming a young girl and for involvement in the death of her benefactress.<br />Miss Prior's elaborate descriptions of Millbank, the incarcerated women, and her daily life at home soon reveal that she, too, is locked in her own private prison from which she has no way to escape. She's already had one \\"nervous\\" episode nearly resulting in her death. This followed the betrayal of a woman with whom she was smitten and the death of her dearly beloved father. She is a woman locked in a world with social mores that do not allow her to be herself-nor even to know who her real Self is. Only Selina has managed to introduce a little magic into her life.<br />With each passing week, the story builds in intensity as Miss Prior visits the dismal Millbank and attempts to see Selina Dawes as often as possible. Though she fights it, little by little, she surrenders to her feelings for the other woman. Will Selina manage to escape and will Miss Prior assist? Is the young woman truly innocent and wrongly convicted? We get clues from periodic diary entries made by Selina, but the mystery of the spiritualist's past is not revealed until the end.<br />AFFINITY has a feel much like the gothic novels of old, and the style and tone made me wonder if Waters could possibly be the spiritual daughter of Emily Brontë and Mary Shelley. The story's impact quietly creeps up on the reader until the surprising denouement, which, though it seems to come out of the blue, I realized I should have seen coming. I found myself thinking of this novel and Miss Prior's horrendous predicament for weeks. AFFINITY leaves a mark.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Reviewer for Midwest Book Review, [   ], and The Independent Gay Writer.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|This movie was the humble begginings of the teen flick craze. But unlike modern day teen films it teaches a valuable lesson. That lesson is everybody has problems wether it's the jock the prom queen or the nerd we all have problems. I feel Buffy The Vampire Slayer put this lesson in perfect context. a boy trys to commit suicide Buffy stops him and asks him why he says \\"No one cares about no one pays attention to me or my problems the popular kids don't care about how hard it is for me\\" Buffy's response is \\" They don't care or pay attention to your problems because they are taking care of their own!!!!!!!\\" This valuble lesson is displayed in this awesome movie (though they could do without the cursing)
B000063DIR|5.0|I know everyone is giving these new remasters bad reviews, but personally I think they sound amazing.  No, this is not the original Diary of a Madman, and yes the drum and bass tracks have been re-recorded by Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin.  That aside, SO WHAT?  The sound quality is excellent and much higher than that of all previous versions of the album.  I think that these new versions of the albums breathe new life into them and give them a fresh, modern sound.  If you buy these new remasters not expecting them to sound EXACTLY LIKE the original versions and listen to them for what they are, they are great sounding and still excellent albums.  Although I have heard all previous versions of this and the other new remasters, I guarantee that someone who has never heard the original version of this album would find no fault in it whatsoever.  The only reason people are giving these new remasters a bad review is because they are stuck in the past and do not believe it is possible to improve on a classic.  They believe that if something is changed at all then it is no longer good.  That is not true and I believe the sound of these albums has been greatly improved upon.  Lastly, in all honesty, who listens to Ozzy Osbourne to hear his drummer and bass player?  Ozzy and Randy Rhoads are the true stars of these albums and are what make them so special, not the background noise of the drum and bass players!
B00005LOUS|1.0|Ugh. Too much unfunny Jim Carrey. I haven't laughed at him since his days on &quot;In Living Color&quot;, which was hilarious. I can't reconcile this mean-spirited travesty with the original except for some of the Seuss dialogue showing up. Skip it.
B00005OCMR|3.0|TRON stars Jeff Bridges as the brilliant computer programmer Flynn.  He's fired from his company for some reason (here's part of why it's so convoluted) and attempts to hack into the company's computer to prove that he wrote some programs stolen by the senior exec, Dillinger.  He enlists the help of several company employees, one of whom has written a hacker program called Tron.  While using the program, Flynn gets sucked into cyberspace and has to disarm the Master Control Program (MCP), which was developed by Dillinger.  Whew!  The plot is way more complex than need be.<br /><br />When released by Disney in 1982, TRON was a bit of a flop.  Expected to be a huge hit, it only placed at #18 for the year, behind such 80s relics as \\"Conan the Barbarian,\\" \\"First Blood,\\" and \\"The Dark Crystal.\\"  This lack of success likely lead to the subsequent dearth of videogames-based movies, potentially sparing us \\"From Pac-Man to Ms. Pac-Man.\\"<br /><br />Despite the lame plot, TRON is good kitschy 80s fun.  The special effects (for 1982) are extremely impressive, and several sequences remain exciting.  In particular, the scenes where the MCP forces the computer programs to battle each other as cyber-motorcycles are quite fun.  Compared to more recent movies based on videogames (e.g., Final Fantasy, Laura Croft movies), TRON is surprisingly tame and gentle, which only adds to its appeal.  This movie may bore many young videogame fans, but it will be enjoyed by fans of 80s movies and videogames.
0156907399|5.0|The time span in \\"To a Lighthouse\\" is from 1910 - 1920. And time is a critical element in this novel whose beginning paints a very insular setting, the small-scale world according to<BR>Mrs. Ramsay. The season is summer and it is an annual event that she, her husband and eight children, a coterie of Mr. Ramsay's academic-type admirers and a spinster with a love of painting, adjourn to the Ramsay's seaside household. <br />The story's unfolding is mirrored in the manner of Mrs. Ramsay's thinking...all internal: about her husband; her children; their family friends; an anticipated engagement; marriage in general and her own in particular; and her husband's preoccupation with his academic career. Without a doubt, Mrs. Ramsay is the glue that holds this little, private cocoon together.<br />Mr. Ramsay, succinctly put, is self-centered. He's introspective; he's occupied with his achievements; and \\"reaching Z\\" is an all-absorbing goal! Contemplative walking and pacing seem to be among his favorite pastimes and his amblings provide him more space to contemplate \\"I, I, I\\" as aptly described by Lily Briscoe, an amateur artist. At times it seems as if being the father of eight, even though his wife shields him from much of the routine of family life... including household expenses...serves as a hindrance to his further achievements. He is a man of logic and will not even tolerate his youngest child's yearnings to go to the lighthouse because the weather on the following day will most assuredly not \\"be fine\\" as Mrs. Ramsay tries to assure the child it will be.<br />There is an occasional sadness and distance about Mrs. Ramsay that manifests following her husband's frequent petulant scenes. Nonetheless she plays her roles to absolute perfection: mother, wife, and nurturer to all including their guests. She sees their shortcomings but accepts them and fosters each in her own way according to their perceived needs.<br />Women are relegated to minor roles; it is the men who are the intelligent ones. And Mr. Ramsay conjectures that much of what his wife reads she may not understand. Yet the couple loves one another... each person according to his own capacity. Mrs. Ramsay is obviously her husband's fan, the one who bolsters him and protects and nurtures him...and the reader is privy to all her thoughts accordingly. There is a glimmer, too, of her disappointment in him, his self-centeredness and his sole reliance on logic.<br />Age (a mechanism employed to show the passage of time) is also a theme in \\"To the Lighthouse\\". Mrs. Ramsay was a beauty, is yet considered a beauty despite her age. Her aging husband, however, is still considered handsome and attracts and welcomes female attention...female flattery. This is appropriate for a man; a woman may gain admiration for her skills and her looks but it would be inappropriate to call attention to herself. <br />The world of children, weather, guests and their idiosyncrasies, Mrs. Ramsay's desire that things remain the same thus assuring her children never having to grow up to face life's problems, takes a huge leap and the reader is propelled from the previous protected cocoon into \\"real life\\".<BR>Mrs. Ramsay dies, son Andrew perishes in World War I, her daughter Prue is escorted down the aisle by her father, and one year later dies giving birth. Yet, the author is ingenious about holding fast to the internal world of the characters, with only an occasional external utterance.<br />Everything has changed. Without the foundational piece, the cement that holds the household and extended household together, the summer place is abandoned, dusty, rotting, decrepit, unattended. No one has vacationed there for 10 years. Subsequently, orders are generated to a former household staff member to re-open the house for a smaller onslaught of visitors.<br />Nothing is the same without Mrs. Ramsay. She is mourned, especially by Lily Briscoe. Only three of the Ramsay children have accompanied their father to thesummer retreat. He is still the bully that he was in their childhood. Their world still operates according to his moods, whims and orders. James and Cam, now 16 and 17, are morose and it always seems as if they are waiting for the \\"other shoe to drop\\". Nothing must go awry or their aged father will be irritated and critical. <br />Mr. Ramsay's preoccupation is still with himself and it is the guests' duty to pity him, fawn over him and focus their attention on the pain dealt him. Lily Briscoe refuses to do this (she is adamant that marriage, as espoused by Mrs. Ramsey as a must, is not necessarily so). She braces herself to deliberately focus her efforts on her art and its composition. She seeks balance in a painting that just doesn't seem to come together. This could be deemed symbolic of a search for balance in her own life and a challenge to attain some personal resolution to her grief over<BR>Mrs. Ramsay's death.<br />\\"To a Lighthouse\\" is a masterpiece; it succeeds as a group and character portrait While a difficult \\"read\\", the story, the plot, the character definition, and the passage of time...largely accomplished through internal dialogue... is ingenious!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|It is my oppinion that of many soundtracks I have collected over the years this is one of the best. The themes are so original, and even if you haven't seen the movie this is a must have for any soundtrack lover. It is as high a quality as Titanic or better. The only short comming of the soundtrack is that it is only 43 minutes long. GO AND BUY THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN AS SOON AS POSIBLE!!!
B000021Y77|5.0|I just sit and watch it without question, i never heard of it before but i love this movie.  Im ready to rent it too.  Excelent techno-trance music.
B000002WPI|5.0|One of my top 10 favorite rap albums, 36 chambers is a classic.  This cd has 12 tracks of killa rhymes and phat beats.  This album shows the talent each member of the Wu has, and launched their own solo albums.  Bottom line, if you are a rap fan, and you don't have this album, get it.  Some of my favorite songs are CREAM, Method Man, Ain't Nuttin to F Wit, Shame On A Nig*a, and Bring The Ruckus.
6302581907|5.0|I love this movie. It is funny and heartwarming. <BR> It is about a lounge singer named Dolores(Whoopi Goldberg) who witnessed a murder crime from her lover Vince. Now she has to hide out in a convent until the police can catch Vince before he kills Dolores.<BR> Now Dolores is Sister Mary Clarence. She meets nuns with different personalities and also nuns that can't sing good. Clarence saves the nuns choir by being the leader of the choir. She did a good job that you will love the music they sing and the soundtrack. <BR> I just recommend this movie to anybody. This is one of my favorite comedies because Whoopi is in it. She is funny!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic without question is a classic album.  This is the album that made Nas the artist that he is today.  Even though this album has only 10 tracks (9 if you don't include the intro) it's still a magnificent piece of work.  All 40 minutes, will keep you listening.  You notice that Nas rhymes with intelligence, and has a flow that is different from everyone else.  One of the best albums I ever heard, Nas is truely the king of NY.
6303140157|3.0|Now the lounge singer Dolores has to save a school from closing. She becomes a teacher of a music class of rowdy students and turning them into a choir so they can enter an all state music competetion to win back the school. Lauryn Hill plays Rita Waltson who can sing really good but hides it because of her mother who hates music. <BR> This movie was kind of funny. But all the nuns arent in the movie they're in just one scene in the movie. These teenagers were bad for the first part of the movie why did the nuns choose them to be the ones to save the school. I just didn't like it as much as the first one but it still a good movie. Just see it if you like! These kids can sing good though.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album is easily their finest. It is classic thrash metal. An absolute must have for all metal fans. I bought this album after I bought Master Of Puppets, which also blew me away by the sound. I walked in, picked it up, rushed home after paying for it, and turned it right on. The acoustic intro did not surprise me at all; I knew it would all be loud when it truly began, and boy, was it ever. A breakdown of the tunes:<br />1. Fight Fire With Fire<BR>Wow. I have never heard such a fast intro. A<br />2. Ride The Lightning<BR>The title track is the weakest on the album, but still great nonetheless. B+<br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls<BR>HEAVY! My friend likes the guitar best on this one, because it resembles the FFVII boss theme. A<br />4. Fade To Black<BR>Probably the second best on the album, beginning as a slow acoustic power ballad, then getting super electric, then quieter, then louder, then it speeds up with a minute and a half long solo! A+<br />5. Trapped Under Ice <BR>Heavy stuff. A-<br />6. Escape<BR>A bit odd, but heavy. A-<br />7. Creeping Death<BR>Ultra Heavy, stays fast, sweet lyrics, electrifying solo from THE Kirk Hammett! Catchy guitar. A++<br />8. Call of Ktulu<BR>Another epic instrumental. A<br />All in all, a fantastic album. It should have been on VH1's Ultimate albums (Black just doesn't come close, plus Cliff is better than Jason).
B00008NRI8|2.0|OK, this review is going to be fairly short.  I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end.  The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable.  Grant has a line where he says &quot;My life is a lot like Monopoly&quot; ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.  <br />This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming.  The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits.  I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest.
B000068IEU|4.0|This has to be one of the most disturbing pictures I have ever viewed in my life. It shows rape, violence, lots of blood, and things that were unimmaginable for its own time. This is not a film for people who are skwimish or easily grossed out. The acting was at first... pathetic.... but as the tension increased, it only got more and more believable. This film is not rated, so I should warn you that it has graphical vilonce, gore, nudity, sexual violence, language, and disturbing images. I would only recommend this film to someone who is ok with seeing this and likes horror flicks or graphic war films. For me, this is one of the top 5 horror films I have seen. It is worth the watch, if you dare.
B00004Z459|5.0|At the start of a new millenium, new band Linkin Park delivers this outstanding debut cd.  If the reviewers think that this band is similar to LIMP BIZKIT, that is pretty dumb.  This band is sooooo much better than crap.  This CD has an original futuristic sound to it, yet still sounding like good original modern-day music.  Every single song I love on this CD, especially songs like 03, 07, 08, 09, 10, and 12.  The only ones I don't care for as much because they got tiring after being overplayed too much on the radio are 02 and 05.  Other than that, this CD is awesome!  LP plays their stuff cool and WELL, without ever sounding absurd and incredibly lame like many \\"rock-rap\\" bands.  This CD has its energy and intensity, and also great instrumental music!  In some respects, some of the guitars on this CD could have slightly better quality, but it's not enough AT ALL to make any kind of difference!  This CD may not be for everybody, knowing how different everyone's taste is nowadays, but it's still worth listening to for many!
B00006LLNU|4.0|The melodies and bowing and extraordinary, but sometimes the vocals get in the way.  It can get on my nerves to hear the high pitched \\"you sigh on, you sigh alone\\" Hopelandic over and over.  Track 8 is absolutely sublime until he cuts in and starts telling us again that we sigh on (sigh).  Maybe that's why I dig track 3, an instrumental.  I happened to play (the live version from Philly concert) while re-watching the opening scene of the film \\"We Were Soldiers\\" with the movie sound off and headphones on.  The complement of the slow bittersweet crescendos and melodies made those first eight minutes stand on their head.  I don't know what the original intent of the director was but listening to this tune with that scene made me cathartically sad about humanity.  Sigur Ros' music is like fine shading and worked well in \\"Vanilla Sky\\". <BR>I think these guys should be writing more soundtracks.
B00009W0WM|1.0|The Greatest American Film is destroyed by a choice of a critic who is chosen to do the commentary in this DVD set. How can they let Roger Ebert, which is considered the most stupid American critic nowadays, be a part of this masterpiece?
B00005JLEU|4.0|While lacking the sheer epic sweep and grandeur of Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away carves itself a more personal, contained, lushness.  An apathetic, depressed 10 year girl must save her parents when they all unknowingly stumble into a gateway to the Japanese spirit world.  Working her [their] debt off in a spirit bath house she enlists the aid of a disparate group of denizens of this strange world.  Like an erstwhile Pollyanna she makes friends and endears herself while learning to care about more than herself and even to love at her young age.  Beautifully animated and vibrant, its appeal stretches across a wide age range as it went on to set box office records in Japan and abroad.  Highly recommended.
B000059XYM|5.0|This movie was extremely funny and anyone how things otherwise needs alittle sence of humor.
B000089RVX|5.0|Vampirical Balladeers will haunt you with this one.  If you feel you are alone in the dark, invite Amy and friends to join you.
B00003CXBK|2.0|Maybe it's just because i don't usually watch anime but i didn't really like this movie. It was kinda dumb if you ask me. I did like the anime Ninja Scrolls, this movie kinda reminded me of a bad version of Ninja Scolls.
B000051VWW|5.0|She is simply the best female vocalist of our time. With all the flash in the pan vocalist that are recording now Sade is the best. We have waited a long time for this diva to hit the scene again. She has tasted sorrow and joy. She is quite simply the best. From start to finish this folky style LP is a story of things only this woman can convey. &quot;Every Word&quot; is my personal favorite.
6305014140|5.0|I don't normally like anime but I thought this was a really good movie!
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie is a breath of fresh air. Singer, songwriter, musician. The track &quot;Beautiful&quot; is so enchanting that it gives me chills.
B000059Z8J|1.0|I have never watched a Superman movie or episode but Superman sounded kinda cool so I rented it. I was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set. If only i could go back in time and tell the 2 hour ago me not to watch this terrible excuse for a movie.
0553573403|1.0|Terrifically bad. As in nothing of worth. Reminiscent of Top-40 music, where any originality and substance is eschewed in favor of exploiting recognizeable cliches ad nauseum.<br />The characters are caricatures. Not a single one has embarked on \\"The Hero's Journey\\". I had zero empathy for any of them. The protagonists and antagonists are indistinquishable, like the clowns on WWF, not the characters in Catch-22. The violence is without purpose. The conflicts are predictable. The mythos derivative. The language is crude, the writing ponderous.<br />I can think of no greater insult to Tolkien's LOTR than to be compared with this tripe.
0780631684|5.0|An excelent film and an excelent dvd features...the story tells about.... a high-school students that are going to travel to paris... but alex browing (devon sawa) cant seem to shake his fear of flying...so he have a premonition about the plane crash...and he and his friends get off the plane and minutes later the plane crash!!! just how alex thought...but the nightmare isnt over now all of them have a count to pay with death because you cant cheat death twice... the movie is excelent and thats why i bought it recommended for everyone!!!
B00000AFFF|1.0|I love Elvis. I would follow him anywhere. But really, what was he thinking? The album is flat. The lyrics ring hollow. The music uninspired. Maybe it's because he didn't write the songs. Maybe Elvis had a cold. Or Jupitur was aligned with Mars. I don't know, but I would urge a die-hard fan to think twice, and a new fan to run away--quickly--and purchase King of America.
B00005JLPK|5.0|So much as been said about this wonderful film, that I will keep my comments brief.  It is a masterpiece -- a work of art.  I enjoy it more each time I watch it.    <br />In addition to the obvious fact that this is a love story on multiple levels, the many interviews included on the DVD demonstrate that the very creation of this jewel was an act of love.  Every participant appears to have been drawn irresistibly into Salma Hayek's dream of presenting an impression of Frida Kahlo's life on the screen.      <br />Moreover, this film goes far in capturing on camera the heart & soul of urban Mexican culture and life in the decades following the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th Century. It abounds with music and color and passion.       <br />Let's face it:  99% of what has come out of Hollywood over the past 20 years is crap that depends upon special effects and pyrotechnics to make up for a lack of literacy, labor & talent. I am delighted that this charming and extraordinarily talented woman from Coatzacoalcos (yes, I've been there) has reminded the American film industry of what quality film making looks like.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is a lyrical and musical genius, but the standout track to me is one that is met with mixed reviews. &quot;Dosed&quot; may fool the less wise listener into thinking it's a sappy optimistic ballad, but it's not. It's about being led on and let go in a cruel way. It's about wanting a person that maybe you couldn't have although you were close at one time with them in a completely platonic-foolishly hopeing-it-turns-romantic way; rejection in the worse way, and not being able to let go. Perhaps the person even led you on, never intending to become monogomous with you, but never telling you that either. The whole &quot;I love you so much that I hate you and it hurts-kinda thing&quot;. A feeling not all can relate to, but I can. My analysis of this track sounds simplistic when put in these terms, but emotions are anything but. To get the full effect of what I'm explaining it helps to listen to the track while your heart is broken over a person who dangles their charms in front of your face while you try to demonstrate that you don't care and hurt them in an even deeper way. A person you can't be completely honest with except through poetry, because blatant words would make you too vulnerable to more hurt.<br />This album is one filled with relatable, poetic lyrics and revolutionary musical techniques mixed with classic styles. A+ for being original, poignant, and innovative.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Oh boy, what a fuzz about this movie.<br />What was it? Number Ten? OK, so what? The Enterprise is going down and this time for good. Not like in The Search of Spock or Generations though. I am afraid the producers miscalculated big time.<br />First of all, I want to say that I am absolutely not against newcomers in the movie business. Actually it was time to have some pop up, but like this?<br />The Man simply cannot act. He mumbles his words. People told me how scary Shinzon was. Scary? He was mad, crazy, paranoiac, but scary? C'mon, give me a break here.<br />Dracula was scary, and I don't mean Gary Oldman. I mean Christopher Lee. When he appeared on top of a staircase, in his long draped cape, in half-shadow, without even uttering a word, you knew he meant trouble. But Shinzon, with his boyish \\"puppy\\" face?<br />I found Ron Perlman far more threatening than him.<br />The story too, is a disgrace. More a work out of a Star Trek computer game, than the excellent and more humane plots of the original series or even of The Next Generation series.<br />Here too, as in my previous review of \\"Die Another Day\\" I saw no imagination, no relation to the characters. They are all puppets set up in a game, rather than living and breathing human beings.<br />You cannot sense the concerns, the true frailty and the pain of the various characters. This was still all there in Generations, First Contact and even in the less fortunate Insurrection. But here?<br />Even the more than human android Data (Brent Spiner), whose struggle to be more like his companions, seems vanished, just to reappear briefly towards the end of the picture as a last minute afterthought.<br />What to say about Data's \\"brother\\"? Well, Lore he is not and it is a wonder that Data ever became Data at all, viewed what a moron this new \\"brother\\" is. Besides, it makes no sense. In all the previous episodes and movies we were constantly told that Data had only one brother.<br />Watch out! Not anymore, now we have another one. A stupid one.<br />And all this for what, a sequel?<br />If the sequel is as bad as this one, I will have seen the last of Star Trek in my life and I will stick to what I own, rather than venture out there, \\"where no sane mind has ever gone before\\".<br />No, Nemesis, is a bitter disappointment. The special effects are OK, but they are not everything. The music is so-so.<br />The directing though, lacks knowledge of the true spirit that made the \\"Big Bird\\" create the series in the first place.<br />We don't need \\"intellectualoids\\" to direct a science fiction - adventure movie. What we need is people who know the series back and forth as the back of their hands and not a Kubrick-like visionary (I doubt that Kubrick even remotely, wanted to direct a Star Trek movie).<br />Where is Leonard Nimoy? He is a director as well. Where is Nicholas Meyer? Those guys knew what they were doing... Even Winrich Kolbe, who directed many TV episodes across the Star Trek spectrum, should have had a chance.<br />But no. Mr. \\"allmighty\\" Berman had to decide otherwise. I wonder if he really knows what Star Trek is all about, besides its money value.<br />Perhaps, Mr. Berman should rather go back to its roots, instead of playing on new territories in which he truly has absolutely no competence about.<br />No Mr. Berman. This is not Star Trek. I don't know what it should represent, but besides recognizing a Sci-Fi flick, I don't see the spirit of Gene Roddenberry in this one.<br />And then they said \\"Star Trek V - The Final Frontier\\" was bad.<br />Well, let me tell you, give me Star Trek V anytime, rather than this weak attempt at inner-psychology.<br />One more thing. At Star Trek XI, bring back some good old villains, rather than your new, dull ones. Anything, Cardassians, Klingons, The Dominion, even the good old Borg.<br />Or why not, a touch of Q gone bad. Or a mixture of them all, but spare us weak imitations, like Kazons (besides, who would really be afraid of villains incurlers?).<br />Last but not least, hire someone who can write an interesting mystery story and had some true, old-fashioned creativeness and imagination.<br />To the actors, my suggestion would be not to listen to the directors so much, but rather let your feelings go wild.<br />To you all, my word of warning, buy it if you are an absolute Star Trek fan and want this one to complete your collection. To everyone else I'd suggest a better use of your time.but not least, hire someone who can write an interesting mystery story and had some true, old-fashioned creativeness and imagination.<br />To the actors, my suggestion would be not to listen to the directors so much, but rather let your feelings go wild.<br />To you all, my word of warning, buy it if you are an absolute Star Trek fan and want this one to complete your collection.

B00009ATIX|1.0|I was so excited when I heard about this film.  Steven Soderbergh, James Cameron, George Clooney, it's Sci-Fi, remake of a classic...  But I'm sorry to disagree with everyone else here but I have tried to watch this movie three separate times and cannot get past the 45 minute point.  It has a very disjointed feel to it, you don't care about any of the charracters because by the time you meet them they already uninteresting.  Hardly anyone speaks and I just cannot stay awake.  If you have difficulty sleeping, throw away your Nyquil and pop in your copy of Solaris...or better yet, take mine.
B0000507PC|5.0|Much of the success of this movie is due to the direction of Lasse Hallstrom and the work of John Irving in adapting his novel to the screen. The acting is superior and the emphasis is on realism. The film deals with some of society's most controversial subjects with skill. THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is an excellent movie which is deserving of its two Academy Awards and several Oscar nominations.
0380799006|5.0|This book has so many ideas to try with children of all ages. I'm sure I will continue to consult it as my children get older. I really like the \\"How To Step In So You Can Step Out\\" strategy that teaches parents how to intervene by acknowledging the feelings of both kids in the heat of the moment which defuses the situation so the kids can work it out themselves.  I like the simple cartoons that clearly illustrate the communication \\"do's\\" and \\"donts\\" with quibbling siblings. I also like the way the discipline tips maintain the dignity of both the parent and the child. When I am able to resist \\"automatic parenting\\" reactions like yelling and threatening, and use some of the great techniques I've learned, I feel so much more competent as a parent. Because I have three young children (5, 3, and 2 months), I would like to also recommend a new pocket-sized book that has been very helpful addressing my specific current sibling issues. Appropriately entitled \\"The Pocket Parent\\", the entire book is written for parents with normal, but often challenging preschoolers.  There are hundreds of short bulleted suggestions addressing sibling issues such as: \\"the new baby\\", \\"comparing and labeling\\", \\"sibling rivalry\\", \\"hitting and hurting others\\", \\"biting\\", \\"bad words\\", \\"I hate you's\\", \\"listening\\", \\"power struggles\\", and \\"traveling with the kids\\". These two books with exactly the same discipline philosophy compliment each other--both having great examples of the exact words to try in many sibling situations.<br />One of the strategies suggested in both books that has really reduced my frustration level is to redefine being \\"fair\\" as \\"meeting each child's needs\\" rather than focusing on being  totally \\"equal\\" at all times.  This thought is very helpful because my kids seem to always keep score...and I, no matter how hard I try--will often lose! Although it doesn't come naturally, I am learning to change my behavior to address needs. For example, Sunday morning I painstakingly tried to serve the exact same pancake presentation to each of the kids--and my son whined, \\"Mommy, that's not fa-a-ir!\\" and he continued to scream that his sister's pancakes were much bigger and browner than his (...in his mind, proof that I love her more). Instead of really losing it and yelling back that he was absolutely wrong, lunging for my ruler to prove it...I PAUSED...And, before I responded, I took a deep breath (...maybe 2 deep breaths) and focused my response on solving the jealousy problem. In total control of the situation, I looked my son directly in his eyes, put my hand gently on his shoulder as I replied in a very calm voice, \\"Hmmmmmmm. It sounds like you're still hungry, Brian...Here are two more delicious pancakes just for you!\\" GREAT ADVICE...and it worked!! Bad news...It does take practice, but feels so good when your thoughtful response avoids a no-win power struggle.d to serve the exact same pancake presentation to each of the kids--and my son whined, \\"Mommy, that's not fa-a-ir!\\" and he continued to scream that his sister's pancakes were much bigger and browner than his (...in his mind, proof that I love her more).

B000002H97|4.0|This album is usually called the ''black'' album.Most people either hate this album or love it.Actually, this album is kind of in the middle for me.Theres no denying that enter sandman is one of the greatest songs of all time,but metallicas first 4 albums were definitley better.Obviously, this is when metallica <BR>entered mainstream.Nothing else matters isn't the best slow song metallica ever recorded,but it probably is the slowest.This album is still awesome, but most metallica fans will be yearning for something more.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Listen to one song on this CD, and you'll know that Christina Aguilera is not the perky and young singer she was back in 1999. Christina has grown, and this album's here to prove it. Many of the songs on this CD are related to or are about Christina's personal experiences, and she has co-written and co-produced all but two of the songs. You can tell that Christina has dug deep, deep into her past, and turned many of her important experiences, good and bad, into songs. <br />The songs on this album also show tremendous growth from Christina's \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" days. Gone is the fluffy bubblegum pop that made her so popular, replaced with heartfealt ballads, inspirational songs, a few angry-sounding rockin' tunes, R&B-flavored songs, and so much more. A few of the songs do seem a little inappropriate for kids, including \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" (a song about casual sex), \\"Dirrty\\" (you've all heard this one by now), \\"Make-Over\\" (Christina throws around the word \\"bulls***\\" in this song a lot), and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (featuring some cussing).<br />However, this is truly a fantastic album. If you didn't like Christina back in her \\"girlie\\" days, listen to this CD, and you'll see her in a totally new light. She's changed so drastically, some of the pictures in the booklet with lyrics picture her completely naked! As Christina claims in the introduction, this is the REAL her, and she's not gonna let anyone stop her from doing what she wants to do. I highly do recommend this CD.
B00004WG2F|1.0|Thank God for Anthony Hopkins, who somehow always delivers an impeccable performance no matter what he is in. He represents the one faintly shimmering star that I have given this movie. That said, the rest of the film is exhausting.<BR>Of course, Brad Pitt is extremely hot. But how long can that distract you from the utter banality of this movie? The plot drags on for hours, interspersed with long, drawn out landscape shots of rolling pastures and mountains until you start asking yourself, &quot;What is this movie about, again?&quot;<BR>It's basically about Julia Ormond falling in love with 3 brothers (alternately, not simultaneously) in the wild, untamed western wilderness during WWI. Mix in a few sympathetic, if stereotypical, Native Americans, a lot of unrequited love, and some convoluted storytelling, and you've got Legends of the Fall. Almost everyone dies (at least once), and those who don't are left behind to woefully mourn their losses and realise, just a few seconds too late, &quot;what could have been&quot;.<BR>We're forced to watch the tragic affairs of Julia's love for each of the brothers in succession, as she loses them in various ways  (tragically, of course, and not always permanently), and all the time longing for Anthony Hopkins to come back on the screen. <BR>When Brad Pitt finally shows up again after a supposed 10-year-long absence, he falls in love with his almost-sister: a gorgeous, statuesque Native American girl who was a scrawny 10 years old last time we saw her (she dies later, of course). However, (OOOPS!) Brad Pitt (and EVERYBODY ELSE) looks EXACTLY THE SAME as they did 10 YEAR AGO! Well, except for Anthony Hopkins, who tragically has a stroke before Pitt returns and looks much older. But still. Come on, people. Lets keep some semblance of reality here.<BR>Of course, this is an epic in the truest sense of the word. But unlike &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, for example, it truly fails to deliver. Just when you begin to care about the characters, something so melodramatic, horrible, and implausable happens to them that you start writing them off, one by one, as hopeless causes. Sort of like this film.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I skipped seeing Daredevil in the theatre, thinking it looked like something that should definitely be rented. I was right.<br />I had never heard of Daredevil before the movie came out, because I dont really know much about superheroes other than the standard spiderman, batman, superman, etc. But even though I had never heard of him before, the story seemed strangely familiar.<br />Boy is exposed to toxic waste/radioactive materials, gains super powers, then a close family member is killed by a Bad Guy which fills the boy with anger and hatred toward the Bad Guy. Then boy gets a costume, brings justice to rapists and muggers, and eventually has some showdowns with super villains.<br />I guess thats just the way comic books are, however.<br />The movie was farely entertaining however, with some good fight scenes and a cool radar effect which shows how Daredevil can see like a bat by seeing the sound waves bounce off of objects. A lot was left unexplained however, such as why Daredevil sleeps in a tank of water, and why he has scars all over his back and is taking a ton of medication. I didnt really understand what that was all about.<br />The love story part of the movie is also farely cheesy. Daredevil meets a lady and sleeps with her the second time they meet, immediately falling in love with her, only to have her die about 15 minutes later in the movie. I guess it was supposed to be love at first site or something, but it still felt really fake and rushed.<br />The supervillains, Bullseye and the Kingpin also felt much more comic booky than the main hero did. Their acting was over the top and exaggerated, whereas Ben Affleck seemed to take the part way too seriously. Bullseye stole the movie in my opinion Colin Farrell seemed to have fun with the part and he also had some really great lines.<br />The ending of the movie was kind of depressing though. Daredevil loses the girl and doesnt kill the bad guys so you dont really get the feeling that he won at all. Maybe they were just hoping for a sequel so they decided to leave all the main characters alive or something.
0790731940|2.0|Now don't get me wrong, the movie was great.  Good acting by all and great casting.  The cast always appears to be genuinely having fun throughout the movie.  The script was the backbone of the movie and made this one of the best comedy / westerns ever.<br />However, the DVD real stinks.  There are no extras except for a few production notes which are all written.  I expected a lot more from such a wonderful movie.  <br />The 2 stars are for the DVD not the movie.
6304981635|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times that I stopped counting. First time was at the age of 15, but I still enjoy watching it today (being a `grown up'). One of my favorites. It is not as sophisticated as today's movies, I admit, but definitively a classic and a must for any martial arts enthusiastic.
B00009ATIX|2.0|Tarkovski's version of this film (1979) was a classic. <BR>A skeleton crew of scientists are stuck on a run-down spaceship much too far from home as back on earth the budget-cut Soviet space program considers cancelling the whole mission. Isolated and cut off from normal society and each other, they gradually start to lose their grip on reality, but the researcher sent to make sense of the collapse of the mission realises that the crew's crumbling personalities are not just down to isolation fatigue, and that their hallucinations are rather more substantial than mission control realise. As the planetoid Solaris reacts to their presence, the crew find themselves in a situation that they are not intellectually, ethically or emotionally equipped to deal with. Think of &quot;Dark Star&quot;'s pessimistic view on life in space combined with &quot;Alien&quot;'s haunted house reworking and throw in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;'s Id Monster and questions about what really makes a human being, and you'd be somewhere in the vicinity.  <br />Anyway, in the (2002) remake, that's kinda changed. The grubby spaceship where gloomy unshaven crew sat around in dirty vests and drank coffee out of cheap polystyrene cups is now replaced by a clean shiny late-1990's designery aluminium and stainless steel construction, with pretty CGI external views. <br />That great hauntingly-mournful Bach piece that you couldn't get out of your head in the Tarky version is replaced by a nondescript &quot;modern&quot; soundtrack. There are no dirty socks. The frustratingly mist-shrouded custard-surfaced planetoid of the original becomes a pin-sharp purple computer-graphics plasma ball.<BR>The nightmarish scene with the liquid oxygen in the earlier film is very tame here and not very credible ... In the remake the &quot;liquid oxygen&quot; seems to be some sort of theatrical blooping green Hollywood goo, and they seem to have forgotten to make it look cold. That really shouldn't have gotten past qualitycontrol.    <br />And that incredible mind-blowing final panout in the original is replaced in the remake by the purple fireball fading into the new Solaris logo. <BR>The best they could come up with for the big ending was &quot;fade to logo&quot;? Doesn't that just make you think &quot;We didn't know how to end the movie&quot; ? Hmm.<br />On the plus side, Clooney does a very good acting job, and manages to &quot;do&quot; silent shock and horror very well, while McElroy looks convincingly unreal throughout. Clooney has an awful lot of screentime where all he does is /look/, and he manages to carry it off without any of the normal acting crutches ... no flashy props, conventional action scenes or snappy dialogue in THIS film. Unfortunately, you often get the feeling that the actors are trapped in a limited script ... Viola Davis in particular often gets stranded without a proper line or anything much to work with. <br />So if you are a Clooney fan, you'll probably love it, and if you have never seen the Andrei Tarkovsky version and want to feel stretched by something that's emphatically not your standard Hollywood scifi film, then you might also think it's great ... but if you liked the Tarkovski version you might feel that the main value of this version is that it shows just how good a job Tarkovski did ... by comparison, this sometimes feels like an experimental student film script being acted out in a very expensive set. <br />Still, at least they were trying ...
B00004RFCM|5.0|I love this show. The dialouge & storylines are very realistic...like they would happen in real life. Which is very different than alot of shows dealing with sex and realtionships out there. I also don't think this show is only for women. Yes women can relate mostly, but I think anyone can enjoy this show. Not only is it dramatic and realistic...it is halarious. I laughed throughout this whole set from start to finish & still I cried and felt what the characters were going through. The first season of Sex and the City is really a rollercoaster ride, and although this is the first season, the show started out really well. Every episode is enjoyable, and the cast is very talented...even the supporting roles. Another good thing about this show is that the New York City scenery is real, actually shot there. That adds alot to the show. It's real, fresh & great entertainment. Isn't that what shows are for? Well, this is one of the best. My favorite episodes of this season, although I loved them all, were \\"Models and Morals\\", \\"Secret Sex\\", \\"Three's A Crowd\\", \\"The Turtle and the Hare\\", and \\"Come Ye All Faithful\\". The funniest episodes were \\"The Turtle and the Hare\\" & \\"Come Ye All Faithful\\". I have never laughed so hard as I did in the final episode \\"Come Ye All Faithful\\". Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catrall, Cynthia Nixon & Kirsten Davis do an amazing job getting this show started...like they'd been doing it forever. Kudos to the cast and crew...this is a great show! Don't miss out!
B00005A0N5|4.0|First, let me start by saying this is the one and only nightwish CD i own, and im not a real big power metal fan either, i got this cd because it has female operatic vocals and not the stressed and exaggerated vocals typical of male power metal singers<br />Overall, i thought this was a very good album.  The climactic choruses are really the focus of some of the songs, and they work very well to keep the music interesting.  The vocals are great, Tarja can really belt it out.  Perhaps the only thing about her singing that annoys me a little is, on occasion, she can't pronounce some words very well and her accent bleeds through, it's not a really big problem though.<br />Why 4 stars?  Well, there are some incredible songs on here, but the album takes a huge dive on tracks 5 and 6.  &quot;Passion and the Opera&quot; is rather boring, and Tarja's accent really ruins the opening lines of &quot;Swanheart,&quot; which potentially could've been a good song if not for those vocals.  Though these tracks do prevent this from being a 5-star album, &quot;Moondance&quot; keeps it from being a 3-star by really picking things up with a really energetic and fun instrumental.  Also there's two bonus tracks that feel like they're just there to make up for such a short 9 songs; not very good bonus songs.<br />The music itself is stellar.  Songwriter and pianist Tuomas is very talented with music, and can write some pretty interesting lyrics as well.  Standout tracks are &quot;Stargazers,&quot; &quot;Gethsemane,&quot; &quot;The Riddler,&quot; and &quot;The Pharaoh Sails to Orion.&quot;
B000002GYG|5.0|Tom waits has lyrics that will make you feel- doesn't matter how they will. In &quot;Nighthawks at the diner&quot; his words blend together with the rythem and the listener's emotions so well it's unbelievable. Throughout the whole live album, you could hear the distinct (and talented) stand-up bass player plucking at the strings under Mr. Waits' one of a kind voice and these combinations spark such ideas and sentiments. Tom Waits has always been my favorite musican since he is so experimental but successful in every album of his, you never get bored of his music. There is always a new play on words to pay attention to or a major detail in the melody. This album (nor any Waits album) shouldn't be missed.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I found myself looking forward to listening to the background music when I watched the film (both times)and decided I needed to get a copy of the soundtrack.  Every place I looked was sold out, until I finally found a copy hiding in plain sight on a shelf above the bin.  <br />What an amazing piece of work!  True, it is a bit short as far as soundtracks go, but you can literally &quot;see&quot; the movie as you listen.  It is reminiscent of &quot;Gladiator&quot;, which isn't surprising<BR>as Han Zimmer contributed to the production.  What it lacks in length it more than makes up in quality.  If you love soundtracks, you'll love this one.<br />My only complaint?  When is the movie coming to DVD?
B000000OQF|5.0|WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE!!!. This cd is timeless.  It is Guns n roses best Cd and one of the best CDs of all time.  It is one of the few cds that you can lsiten to without skipping any songs.  This Cd is legendary.  Any persons CD collection is incomplete without it
B000006TRV|4.0|Great art requires technical skill and the ability to affect us emotionally or change the way we view the world. This album contains both. Roger Waters' music and lyrics are dark and disturbing. David Gilmore is one of the finest guitarists on the planet. Pink Floyd, as always, produces a universe engulfing soundscape which needs to be heard through professional quality headphones to be fully appreciated.<br />The Wall is an amazing piece of music. Thematically, it is an amalgum of many of writer Roger Waters' other works -- something of a cross between Dark Side of the Moon (sanity/insanity) and Wish You Were Here (Music Industry hype). Like the Who's \\"Tommy,\\" this album is essentially a song cycle/rock opera about a boy who is emotionally damaged as a child and grows up to be a rock star, only to continue be damaged by the demons within. But here, the main character, \\"Pink,\\" was damaged not by a single traumatic event as in Tommy(witnessing the killing of his mother's lover by the father returning from war and following forceful admonition to not let anyone know about the killing), but by a series of more normal, every day traumas: an overbearing and protective mother, an abusive teacher and the loss of his father to war. In the end, Pink ends up addicted to pain medications prescribed by his doctors and in an insane asylum. Pink does not triumph in the end. The worms just eat into his brain. By the end of the album, I end up feeling like I should be getting paid to be Pink's psychotherapist.<br />As dark as the album is, or perhaps because of its darkness, it contains some of Pink Floyds best music, including such classics as \\"Happiest Days of Our Lives/Another Brick in the Wall part 2,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell.\\" On the other hand, the album also contains pieces like \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" and \\"The Trial\\" which are something akin to a cross between a Dickens novel and a Broadway musical.<br />Despite the fact that the album is not as consistent as some of PF's other work, this album contains grand and emotionally disturbing themes along with enough very good music to make it well worth owning. While perhaps not an essential album in a rock collection, it is awfully close.
B000065V9N|5.0|Red Rain made the charts; Don't Give Up and In Your Eyes are the heart and soul of this record.  In these songs, you FEEL the music, it runs straight to your heart.  NOT GOOD if you are missing that someone special, as it will do nothing to help.  One of my all time favorites.
B00009L1TA|4.0|&quot;Basic had more twist then a twizler!&quot; Basic was a fresh Military/Thriller for me, that entertained me till the end! I did not see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it. The movie had a much deeper story then the trailer let on. John Travolta and Sam Jackson light up the screen once again! A must rent DVD!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is surely the best comedy I have ever seen. It is based on the classic tale &quot;Knights of The Round Table&quot;. Except, this movie adds its own little twists, e.g. King Arthur rides an imaginary horse wile his apprentice clunks coconuts together, the French poke fun at him, and everybody sings hilarious songs, oh, and I forgot to mention, this movie has some wonderfully sick humor. This special edition gives you an inside look at where the movie was filmed with actor commentary. You will learn amazing facts, like how the movie was filmed in a very small area. And this isn`t one of those movies you only watch once. No, no. You`ll want to keep watching it over and over. Soon enough you`ll be quoting it.  This is definitely  is the best of all the Monty Python movies. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B000002VCU|5.0|In my opinion The Turn Of A Friendly Card of The Alan Parsons Project is the best album ever made. The title song with lead vocals of Chris Rainbow is amazing. The instrumental 'Gold Bug' is even better than other APP instrumentals such as Sirius and Mammagamma of the Eye In The Sky album. Furthermore the voice of Eric Woolfson on 'Time' is supernatural. Other great songs are 'Maybe A Price To Pay' and 'Games People Play', that also made it to the charts. The Turn Of A Friendly Card is a majestic piece of art. Buy and listen to this wonderful combination of classical, rock and pop music!

B000089RVX|5.0|If you like rock then this cd is a must have!! i would say every song on this cd is great. A good investment for every rock fan's collection
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is the best album I have heard this year. I have looked over other reviews, and I don't think that these people giving the album 1 star know what they are talking about. &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; is an amazing track, however is not the only bright spot on the album. Elephunk has many songs that could be hits, such as &quot;Hands Up&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, &quot;Labor Day(It's A Holiday)&quot;, &quot;Latin Girls&quot;, &quot;Fly Away&quot;, and &quot;Anxiety&quot;. They explore so many kinds of music on this album. That's what makes Elephunk such a great CD. The addition of Fergie adds a whole new part to their music that we haven't heard before. If it is true that this is going to be their last album, I think they should definitely rethink that. I think Black Eyed Peas could have a whole lot of good music to come.
B0000027F8|3.0|Three years after the release of George Michael's solo debut album FAITH,LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE didn't garner many hits as its predecessor. I don't think he received or was nominated for any Grammys for the album. FREEDOM 90,I guess we could say is a sequel to FREEDOM which was from Wham!'s MAKE IT BIG album. The 90 is for the release year at least. Each track gives its own recording date. Recording of this album began in 1988 when FAITH was selling well. WAITING FOR THAT DAY includes samples of the Jagger-Richards classic YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT(just those words and the music set to those words). COWBOYS AND ANGELS has been played on many jazz stations around the world.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck Has Really Outdone Himself This Time. If You're Expecting Mellow Gold, Odelay, Midnite Vultures, or Even Mutations, You Won't Find It Here. This Is One Of The Saddest Records To Be Released In Our Era. Listen To 'Guess I'm Doing Fine' And You'll Understand How Important This Is To Our Generation. Everyone Can Relate To This Cd Somehow, You Can Feel His Emotion In Every Word. Sadness Has Ever Been Expressed So Perfectly. I Own 2 Copies And You Should Too. Remember, If You Want A Little Taste Of Sea Change, Download 'Guess I'm Doing Fine' But PLEASE Buy The Cd. Support Beck Because Not Many Artists Are Able To Release Music Of This Caliber. Absolutely Amazing!
0425098478|4.0|I had put off reading this book because of the idea that management can't occur in one minute.  Wrong.  While it takes much longer to become a good manager, the tiny minutes in a day gives us ample opportunity to manage people for positive results.  This book isn't rocket science.  It's written in Ken Blanchard's sensible, easy to read parable format that makes it as much fun to read as it is insightful.  Managers, whether aspiring, new or old-hands will find something that challenges them to be better working with their people.  I suggest you make it required reading for your management staff.
B00009ATIX|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie will be on Rotten Tomatoes site very quickly if it hasn't already been added.<br />Clooney should stick with ER or movies with fishing boats in them, because this movie doesn't cut it, or if it does it is cutting cheese.<br />There is no story to the movie, and the acting is horrible. James Cameron should also stick with movies about boats and let the Sci-Fi movies be directed by people that have seen a good one.<br />Good luck if you buy this one!
B00000F566|5.0|I thought this movie was amazing. Patrick Swyze and Jennifer Grey were both amazing, excellent dancers. I can easily watch this movie 100 times in a row and not get bored.
B00008K7AM|5.0|I loved this movie. It had me laughing from begining to end. Its one of those movies that you don't have to think about. You just sit back and enjoy. I love everything that Rob Schneider does and in my opinion this is his best movie yet. If you loved his earlier films, you''l defeinitely love this one.
0385504209|3.0|When my daughter asked me what this book was like, I thought &quot;Indiana Jones for nerds&quot; was an apt description.  The main character is even described as looking like Harrison Ford.  Regardless, this is a fast paced story, helped along by short chapters.  There are some really eye opening historical facts discussed in this novel, so much that I want to read more on this subject.  So, in summary, the story itself is great, but I felt the writing style of the author was a little melodramatic.  If you can get past that &quot;over the top&quot; style, you will enjoy this book.
0688163173|5.0|I was very excited about reading this book.  I thought Mystic River was excellent so I expected good things from this book.  I can honestly say I was not disappointed in the least.  Shutter Island offers many twists and turns and the deeper Teddy gets the more he uncovers.<br />If you like Mystic River then I really recommend reading Shutter Island.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|I watched the movie and was so blown away by the score that I immediately purchased the soundtrack.  While the soundtrack is a great symphonic work with the tracks blending from one to the next seemlessly, the overall length is way too short.  I was expecially dissapointed to find that the final, climatic track was only 1:30.  However, this is my only complaint.  The music is haunting, stirring, and uplifting.  I quite enjoy it, and I'm sure you will, too.
0385504209|5.0|I sat and read this book for 7 hours straight - unable to disconnect from the wild ride found within these pages.  It is not often that a book pulls me in so completely that I forget about the weekend chores waiting and allow myself such a decadent escape.<br />24 hours later, I am still reeling.  I have read many, many of the reviews for this book - both here and on the web.  I have followed the authors links and read even further about the theories presented by this author & other writers.  I keep asking myself, what is it that has me so drawn to this subject matter?<br />I like the idea- the possibility- that there remains in this life a discovery of such magnitude as The Da Vinci Code.  The modern world seems empty of mystery and the possibility of new discoveries and grand adventures.  This story - albeit fiction - pulls our eyes away from the feelings of hopelessness that has invaded a majority of Christian faith & throws us head first into the eternally magical quest for the Holy Grail.  Only we learn the quest is really ...oops.  Cant say that!<br />Just know this - the scientific mind will tear it apart looking for its weaknesses; the devoted religious will refuse to even entertain its message because to do so threatens the very core of Christian beliefs.  But balanced on that fine line where science & religion come ever so close to one another, there is this refreshingly taut & fantastically bold story (and story is the key word here)  with a very timely message.  Enjoy!!
B0000025FG|5.0|ELO is one of those bands that liked to tinker with different styles, but always made good songs.  This is one of my favorite ELO albums because it's so much fun.  Yeah, it's poppy, but it's good.  Disco-ish undertones run through a few songs, but not all.  The rest is typical ELO. I always wondered what ELO would be like if they had today's technology back then.
B000008HPE|5.0|In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is &quot;Hip To Be Square,&quot; a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
B000002TYK|3.0|&quot;Foo Fighters&quot; explodes with &quot;This Is A Call&quot; and &quot;I'll Stick Around&quot;, then most of the rest are pretty good, except for &quot;X-Static&quot; which is annoying.  The Foo Fighter sound is muscular poppy rock.  Dave plays mean chords (in fact, he played almost everything on this album) and occasionally simple leads.<br />It's a good sound, real good in concert, and this CD was a fine start to a new group.  It definitely helped get him out from under Kurt's shadow.
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis was great in getting access to Billy Beane and his staff. He does a great job is weaving a business and baseball story together. I love Billy for his passion and commitment to his method, never wavering in his goal. Ownership of the A's are very lucky to have a Billy Beane navigating the A's in this time of tremendous fiscal turmoil in baseball. Read it for every reason you would read both a baseball and business book.
B000002L9M|5.0|Interviews of the band even admit that this is their best album.  Not only does it uphold the test of time, unlike some older DM work, every song is good.  This album really is the point where DM finds their sound and really gets serious about their work.  I think technology helped a bit as well.  It is too bad that their biggest album was Violator which came after this one.  It brings back so many high school memories.  Great for in the car.  I own the CD and the record.

This isn't country the way Tim McGraw is, don't turn your brain off when you hear alt-country.  Nirvana is not The Beach Boys, and Tim McGraw is not Ryan Adams.<br />Take time for something worth while, this a beautifully written CD with a lot of soul.<br />I look forward to more from Ryan, I think he can only get better.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles were getting a little more musically complex by &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, but they're still a rock-n-roll band.  Whether riff-rock like &quot;Drive My Car&quot; or more adventurous like &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; or &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, each song sounds good.  The only except is &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, where the lyrics grate a little on my 21st century ears.
B0000797IO|3.0|After hearing reviews of Jennifer Aniston's(the not so good &quot;good girl&quot;)most recent cinematic achievement, I was interested.  I had no idea of the intensity, the raw reality of it, and that Mike White, a scriptwriter in need of serious psychotherapy, had written it.<br />The story is about the miserable Justine(Aniston), unhappily married to Pothead Phil(John C. Reilly), and very soon to be adultress with Holden(Jake Gyllenhaal).<br />Justine works at the Retail Rodeo at the make up counter.  An odd ensemble of characters works there, and it is where she meets Holden.  Both caught up in their miserable lives, they<br />&quot;Get each other&quot;.<br />Once Justine wants the breaks put on it all, is where things really start to get weird. Holden becomes obsessive about Justine.  She isn't sure what she wants out of life, and she isn't sure who Holden really is much less herself.<br />Life for our &quot;good girl&quot; just keeps getting weirder and weirder, and the more I watched Justine and her reactions to the bizarre situations that arise, the more I kept thinking, this is not a good person.  Just what is Mike White trying to prove here? That a very dishonest woman who cheats on her husband is good.  If that's good, I would hate to see his version of bad.<br />I know I know, I could've shut it off. But I was intrigued. and I was blown away at the acting of Aniston, Reilly, and Gyllenhaal.  They were all brilliant and really gave their all to these oddball characters.<br />Do I recommend this movie?  If you like Mike White's body of work maybe.  If you can appreciate watching a movie of stark reality(as I know &quot;good girls&quot; like this one) and some of the best acting of the year 2002, this might be a good rental choice.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Overall this is an excellent movie.  But it's not one of the best.  Clearly Scorsese was going for the Oscar.  He tried way too hard.<br /><br />The premise is fantastic.  The US as a coherent nation did not come about until after the Civil War, and this film gives insight as to how different New York and the country was 150 years ago.  There were a number of external themes Scorsese had to work with, including race relations, ancient enmities (Irish and English), and the promise and horrors of a new country torn apart by civil war.  As for the personal theme - the boy whose dead father, leader of the outlawed 'Dead Rabbit' immigrants, becomes the protege and surrogate son of his father's killer and bigoted rival, 'The Butcher'- Scorsese had great potential for character development.  There was much here to work with.<br /><br />All the actors did phenomenal work, probably the best they've ever done.  Problem is, Scorsese went for star power and some actors didn't measure up.  Lewis, bar exception, was fantastic.  His performance alone is worth the DVD (right up there with Ben Kingsley's gangster in 'Sexy Beast').  DiCaprio did his best work, but he missed the mark.  Same with Diaz.  The love interest did nothing for the plot and, with all the available themes, only wasted film and time.  Their first meeting seemed lifted from 'Titanic'.  Was this the best DiCaprio could muster?  Scorsese needed greater depth overall, and DiCaprio failed to deliver.  As for Diaz, sorry, she should stick to 'Mary' and 'Angel' movies.  This too was beyond her (although in her defense her script was pathetic).  Scorsese went for pretty faces rather than force of character, an unwise move.  The lesser characters, for the most part, were excellent.<br /><br />Finally, the script.  As mentioned elsewhere, it failed to utilize the various themes and subplots to their full potential.  The 'admiration' Butcher had for Priest is overplayed, and the Diaz/DiCaprio love theme adds nothing.  However, the growing influence of the Federal government, the war and desperation of the Union army, even Tammany's city government, are all underplayed, making the movie disjointed.<br /><br />So in trying to generate revenue, use star power, and create an Oscar winner, Scorsese succeed in making a good movie and failed to make a great one.

B0000507PC|4.0|THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a movie that deals with tough questions but does not provide any easy answers. It is based on a novel by John Irving and adapted for the screen by the author.<br />The story is mostly about life and death at an orphanage in Maine called St. Cloud's before and during World war II. In particular it is about a boy (Tobey Maguire) who is twice rejected by prospective parents and returned to the orphanage. He is then trained by the director (Michael Caine) of St. Cloud's to be his assistant as an obstetrician and gynocologist. With great sadness Maguire leaves St. Cloud's as a young man to  see the world and ends up on the Maine coast where he works on an apple farm with migrant workers.<br />Because of the heavy subject matter the mood is often sombre and some of the incidents involving the orphans seem especially heartbreaking. Tobey Maguire is superb in the leading role as Homer Wells. Michael Caine is excellent as Dr. Wilbur Larch. The rest of the strong supporting cast includes Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Erykah Badu and Kate Nelligan. Lasse Hallstrom is known as the director of several other fine films including CHOCOLAT and MY LIFE AS A DOG.<br />THE CIDER HOUSE RULES won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Michael Caine) and Adapted screenplay. It also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director (Lasse Hallstrom), Editing, Original Score and Art Direction.
B00009UW0N|4.0|Halloween 25th anniversary edition is near perfect.  It is almost everything any true Halloween fan could ask for. Halloween which was released in 1978 started the whole slasher genre and is arguably the greatest horror movie of all time.  The only negative thing is that why isn't the extended version  included in this? That version with extra 12 minutes was the best version of the film?  It is pretty stupid to spend another 20 bucks just to buy a seperate DVD which is the Halloween Extended version.
0553573403|3.0|After having finished the book (after first having thrown it aside in disgust at the way females were portrayed) I feel now like revising some of my earlier comments.<br />My earliest complaints about the book, that no powerful and important female characters existed, proved to be ultimately unfounded.  In particular, Daenerys's journey from victim to khaleesi is well-executed and interesting.  Martin writes with a great deal of technical skill and has an excellent ear for dialogue (I seem to recall reading somewhere that he worked in television for a long time, which is probably why).  His plotting is well-crafted, and the idea of having events be seen and interpreted differently from different angles (one event that springs readily to mind is Eddard Stark's recounting to King Robert about finding Jaime Lannister on the Iron Throne during the sack of Dragonstone) is a good trick that other writers would do well to make use of.  He also has certainly done his research on medieval times and depicts it convincingly.  Some have complained about his depiction of Daenerys's wedding night, as she was only thirteen at the time.  In medieval times, however, marriage at thirteen for girls was not at all unusual--when the average lifespan does not go much past forty, and may be shorter than that for women who had at that time the added risk of dying in childbirth, children grow up fast.  (In Romeo and Juliet, Juliet was only thirteen, and as her father (? can't remember off the top of my head) commented, \\"Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\")<br />HOWEVER (and this is a big however), in spite of his technical skill, in the end I never got the sense that the author gave a damn about his characters.  It was not that he had not put any thought into them, it was more a sense that he just didn't care about them as people, that he saw them as nothing more than puppets to push around at his whim.  Robert Jordan has a similar problem, however with Jordan I feel it's more a function of a plot that has grown out of control; occasionally I do get the sense that he does care.  I never felt that with Martin.  This is not to impugn his skill as a writer; as I said previously he does evince a great deal of technical skill.  However, it did make it hard for me to get into the story, because if the author doesn't even care, then why should I?  (Contrast with Michelle West, who lacks Martin's technical skill in that her prose is often desperately overwritten, yet at the same time obviously cares a great deal about her characters and makes the reader care too--I was in tears at the ending of The Broken Crown.)  His obsession with depictions of death and decay at first seemed a nice piece of scene-setting, but by the end of the book felt more like a gimmick, like something he was throwing in there because he thought it looked cool.  If the book was in the horror genre I might have found it less gimmicky as such things are a convention there (although even in the horror genre, such depictions eventually become tiresome--Stephen King, I'm looking in your direction), but in the fantasy genre I'm less inclined to tolerate it.  Some rather important characters remained undeveloped--Joffrey in particular was such a cartoonish caricature that I almost found him laughable--and to top it all off, despite his inclusion of active female characters, the entire book carried a hard-to-define air of misogyny.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what I found so irritating, but I think it's there.  For example, two of the main female characters, Cersei and Lysa, are walking, talking misogynistic stereotypes--Cersei is the False ... Queen who sleeps with her brother and swears eternal hatred to her husband for no better reason that he called the name of his deceased beloved on their wedding night, and Lysa is the Neurotic Emasculating Mother who still breastfeeds her son at seven years old.  It is possible to write a negative female character and have her not be such astereotype--Delores Umbridge in Order of the Phoenix is one example; Steven Brust also generally does a good job with this--but apparently Martin can't pull it off.  Another factor contributing to this sense of misogyny may be the constant and casual depiction of sexual violence against women and only women--Viserys sexually assaults Daenerys, Lyanna was kidnapped and raped by Rhaegar, the depiction of the khalasar riders sharing the Lamb women, the ultimate fate of Eroeh--Again, I've seen depictions of sexual violence and life in a sexist society that don't come off this way, but somehow here I found the whole effect disturbing.  (David Eddings, oddly enough, I have found, can write a sexist society and even sexist stereotypes of women without teetering into misogyny; perhaps it's because Eddings obviously deeply loves all of his characters, the women no less than the men, whereas as I mentioned before, I felt that Martin just didn't care.  Eddings also tends to write extremely powerful females who command a great deal of respect from all the men around them, such as Polgara; with the possible exception of Daenerys, I didn't see one here.) At the end of this book, Daenerys possesses the most firepower of anyone in his world; it will be interesting to see if Martin lets her keep this firepower in the later books or if he diminishes or takes it away from her because she's a girl (and if he does diminish her power, he will have to do some very, very good writing in order to convince me that he didn't do so because she's a girl, despite whatever chain of events leads to this in the book).a stereotype--Delores Umbridge in Order of the Phoenix is one example; Steven Brust also generally does a good job with this--but apparently Martin can't pull it off.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever. It should be required viewing for anyone who lives in this country. It shows what sacrifice truly is. What the soldiers went through for our freedom is sobering. When my children are older and able to understand and stomach this content (unflinchingly graphic), they will learn how fortunate they are and to cherish where and how they live.
B00003CXXM|5.0|This movie is brillant.this movie is an action movie.Matt Damon is a brillant actor.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is probably one of the first CDs I've bought in months &amp; was well worth it!  It is refreshing to finally have something a bit different to listen to and that I can actually relate to unlike much mainstream music today!  I know Evanescence will be around for a long time because of how talented the group is - between writing their own songs and Amy Lee's voice (you should hear her live!) Evanescence is a good buy and well worth supporting - you won't be disappointed!
