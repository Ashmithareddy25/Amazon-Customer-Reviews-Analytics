0553801473|5.0|Never quite delving into the world that is fantasy literature, a few years ago I stumbled upon George R. R. Martin's epic series A Song of Ice and Fire...and it was love at the first turn of the page.  Now, 6 years after the last installment, A Feast for Crows, was released, Martin has delivered another masterpiece.  A Dance with Dragons, the fifth and latest book in the series, has proved to be more than well worth the wait that had fans crying foul.  The first 600 of nearly 1,000 pages of the book pick up with many of the beloved characters that had been missing since the end of the third installment.  But Dance goes further, reuniting some of the characters from the previous story as the narrative moves ever onward.  While other reviewers seemed to think there was not enough plot resolution, I think this tale does nothing but build up the excitement and suspense for the next book.<br /><br />Without sending out any spoilers, Dance is the ultimate quest novel.  From suitors racing to the east to win the hand of the Dragon Queen Daenerys Targaryen, to the frozen lands north of the Wall where Jon Snow must keep an ancient evil at bay, Martin's characters must struggle to find order in the chaos that threatens to overwhelm them.  As battles and treachery continue to divide the land of Westeros in the final stages of the wars for the Iron Throne, in the East, mounting threats to Daenerys' rule continue to grow.  Meanwhile, moving ever eastward, Tyrion Lannister flees for his life with a motley band who may turn out to be the most dangerous threat to the Dragon Queen.<br /><br />Poignant, physical, haunting, and even frustrating at times, Martin's A Dance with Dragons delivers all and more than promised.  A page-turning story for people who love fantasy, and even those who don't, you can't miss the latest tale in what promises to be one of the most epic series the genre has ever seen.<br /><br />Caitlin Warnock

0756405890|5.0|Being an avid reader, I never was much into the fantasy genre of literature.  Of course there were a few books that crept in over the years, but I never considered myself a big fan of that kind of story telling.  That has all changed now.  I stumbled upon this book in a section of a bookstore showcasing books that might appeal to fans of The Game of Thrones series.  Since I loved those I thought I would give this one a try...and wow!  While there is certainly a good deal of magic and a plethora of fantastical creatures in this story, they are so grounded that I never thought to question the \\"reality\\" of the tale.  Often those elements that make a fantasy story what it is seem contrived, and even a little silly.  But that is not the case at all in this book.  I loved the characters, especially our protagonist, Kvothe.  There is real depth to his complex character and I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy to see him grow and develop into one of the most memorable characters I have ever read.    Don't be daunted by the large amount of pages (something I personally love) because every page is well worth the time it takes to read them.   In short, the story is fantastic with enough turns and twists to keep me wondering where the hero will end up next.  But even more than the story, the characters are what make this book the best of fantasy-the kind where you can't wait to turn the page, but are also hesitant to, lest the book be over too soon!

0385534639|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning.  No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers.  It is simply there, when yesterday was not.\\"  With these first lines of Erin Morgenstern's debut novel the reader is introduced to the world of the Night Circus.  Set among the black and white striped tents of a mysterious traveling circus whose gates only open at sundown, a competition of fantastical sorts takes place.  A tale as much about love and free will as it is about magic, The Night Circus wraps us in a dream-like state that arouses the senses and transports us to a place where magic does not seem so impossible.    It is in such a setting that sees two young magicians battling among the circus tents to win a competition they have unwillingly been bound to.  But when love threatens all their mentors have planned, the circus and all those involved are endangered.    Morgenstern has crafted a place where the boundary between reality and magic are blurred.  It is a fun read that provides a wonder-filled escape from the ordinary.  This enchanting tale will keep the reader enthralled, always looking around the next corner of the maze to see what happens next.  For those who love fantastical stories, and even for those who don't, The Night Circus can't be missed.  Caitlin Warnock

I read it first in high school and it didn't occur to me then how truly amazing this story is. Scout is fun and so easy to love!

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Megadeth's thirteenth full-length studio album Th1rt3en saw the first official studio return of long time 80s/90s Megadeth bassist David Ellefson after almost a decade long absence. Elsewise, the line-up of Mustaine, Drover and Broderick, which featured on the band's other two Roadrunner Records albums, remains intact.<br /><br />After starting a new period in their career with the excellent The System Has Failed album from 2004 and continuing in an upward trend of quality with 2007's United Abominations and 2009's much loved Endgame, expectations for this new album were very high indeed, it seemed as though the band just kept getting better and better.<br /><br />2011's Th1rt3en doesn't entirely manage to live up to and eclipse the high standards set by that continuing rise in quality but is a solid and enjoyable modern album roughly in the same style that Megadeth fans should certainly enjoy, which delivers everything good that those albums delivered, even if it doesn't feel as instantly loveable as some of their best records.<br /><br />The material on the album isn't all completely new and you may have heard some of it before in older forms if you are a big Megadeth fan. For example, the tracks `Sudden Death' and `Black Swan' have both been available for quite a while from separate releases, and the tracks `Millennium Of The Blind' and `New World Order' are remakes of classic 90s outtakes which many fans will likely have heard the original versions of at some stage.<br /><br />The album also contains the singles `Never Dead,' and `Public Enemy No. 1' which if you have heard already should be indicative of the style and quality of the album as a whole. Elsewhere, `Who's Life Is It Anyway' and `Fast Lane' maintain much of the sound from the band's previous two albums and are all anyone could ask of a modern Megadeth release, whereas `Deadly Nightshade' adds some variety to the mix with it distinct sound and brilliant 1990s sounding staccato mid-section.<br /><br />Stylistically; the tracks, for the most part, are all brief and catchy, with high quality lead guitar work and an energetic chorus with either a relatively high pace throughout or mid paced verses that pick up the pace a bit for the guitar solos.<br /><br />Whereas the band's previous few albums had deliberately tried to incorporate more of the feeling of both Thrash Metal and the Countdown/Youthanasia style into the sound, this album finds the leaning more on their 90's side and retaining the modern production and guitar focus, which has met with mixed reviews.<br /><br />When you listen to it all and take it in properly it can either be viewed as Megadeth getting back to basics and delivering only the best bits, or if you are more cynical, as a mildly lazy album with no desire for progress just fulfilling their Roadrunner contract. Personally I believe it is the former, especially based on what Dave Ellefson has been saying about the record.<br /><br />After the initial few listens just taking in the styles and the similarities and differences to previous Megadeth releases however, the album can grow on you a lot.<br /><br />Overall; Th1rt3en isn't the single greatest album in the entire Megadeth catalogue, but is definitely worth giving a try. There are enough good songs and interesting guitar moments to justify the purchase and make Th1rt3en an absolutely worthy addition to your collection, and if you liked their last few albums then you'll probably like it a lot.all brief and catchy, with high quality lead guitar work and an energetic chorus with either a relatively high pace throughout or mid paced verses that pick up the pace a bit for the guitar solos.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|This is a awesome movie.  I watched it with about 10 friends and they absolutely loved the movie.  They really got into the movie, which is hard for die hard anime fans to do, especially with a DVD movie.  I would definitely watch the movie in the Japanese with English subtitles.  The movie does start off a bit slow, but it starts moving faster and faster.  I want to say that it is probably the best movie, I have seen in the past 2-3 years.
0525423281|5.0|First off, let it be known that I love the reality that somehow makes its way into these teen novels by Stephanie Perkins.  No matter how far from what I know for the teens around me, her characters feel real, vulnerable, and engaging.  In short, these teens are people you wish you were friends with and had hung out with when you were in high school.  In that way, they aren't that unrealistic, but they lend their hearts to you so you can understand their reactions, hopes, and desires.  I love that about these characters.<br /><br />Not really taking off where the wildly popular Anna and the French Kiss left off, but still including our much loved Etienne and Anna, we have what feels like an extension piece that adds another story to the pot.  In this case, we have the fashionista, Lola, who first steals our heart with her own back story behind how she came to be adopted by her two dads.  It doesn't take long though to also love that slightly awkward boy next door, Cricket, who wears his heart on his sleeve in so many ways.  We want to hang onto Max, but what is it about rockers always putting their \\"craft\\" first, thus leaving any chance for real connections to a day in the future?<br /><br />I really liked Lola, Cricket, and even Max (at least in the beginning).  Lola seems just in her reasons for not wanting to let that next door neighbor boy back into her life.  She wants to do what is right for all involved, but how in the world can you do that when you don't even know what that \\"right\\" thing is to begin with?  This seems to be at the crux of all Lola goes through in this novel.  What is right in romantic love?  What is right in parental love?  What is right in friendship?  What is right for happiness?<br /><br />In short, I loved this second installment by Perkins.  She has a wonderful knack of creating characters that you want to walk around with for awhile, and hate to set aside when the book is finished.  In all of their individual quirks and weaknesses, we love them all the more.  And in this case, Lola and the Boy Next Door has enough romantic tension to keep anyone flipping pages until the book is finished.  Where some romantic teen novels have romance, Perkins creates crazy-real tension; tension that anyone who has ever loved someone but not been handed them on a romantic platter will readily understand.  The misunderstandings and sappy sentimentalities are so understandable that we all fall in love with Lola and want to see her truly and undeniably happy.<br /><br />If you haven't read a Stephanie Perkins novel, you really must.  The judge is still out on which book I liked better, but I think Anna won out, but only because of my own whole recent Paris trip.  Honestly, these books are so strongly character driven that you will instantly see parts of yourself in them.  In some way, you'll see yourself resolving teenage relationships that probably took you way too many years in your own real life.  In short, Lola and the Boy Next Door is a great read that will easily capture the love of many readers who either see themselves in these characters, or wish they had been them at a much earlier age.this case, Lola and the Boy Next Door has enough romantic tension to keep anyone flipping pages until the book is finished.

B0000691U1|1.0|Wow.  This might be the worst recorded jazz record I've ever heard.  I know that every jazz fan is supposed to pee their pants over this rare trio recording of three of the biggest names in jazz, but the truth is the audio is so distorted that it's unlistenable.    I can't imagine what was going on in the studio to create such a sonic disaster - there are plenty of great sounding recordings from this era and earlier.  Such a shame that the original engineer ruined it, and all the 24-bit remastering in the world is not going to salvage it.    Listen to the samples before you buy - this is one severely distorted recording.  Only \\"true believers\\" will be able to enjoy this one.
0525423656|5.0|Following on the heels of Matched, we know that Ky has been sent to the Outer Provinces and Cassia has watched her friend, teacher, and love be taken away from her.  For any reader of the first book, we have been anxiously waiting to find out what Cassia was going to do and where exactly Ky went.  Beyond that, what in the world is going on in this controlling society and what were we not being told?  In essence, it was all such a mystery that this follow up novel was highly anticipated for the answers it held.<br /><br />Without giving away much-anticipated information, I can say that Cassia sets off to find Ky.  The opening of the book was actually a little slow as it set up what had and was happening to both Cassia and Ky.  The narrative is split into chapters that tell each of their stories, so we are allowed to hear what they are both thinking and what they are witnessing.  Honestly, these opening \\"journey chapters,\\" as I like to call them, give us a bit more information about the society that we just have to have.  Sadly, it's still not enough information!  With what little we know, it gives the novel this foreboding, ominous tone.  There is this sadness and anxiety that hangs over the story as our two main characters narrate their journeys and travel along different, but hopefully converging paths.<br /><br />Although the opening chapters have a lot of story to cover and build up, I felt that it was all necessary to the story and helped me wrap my head around what this society was trying to achieve.  It still feels odd and needs A LOT of explaining, but we're finding out little bit more in this installment.  The final 1/3 of the novel is where the real crux of the action takes place, and many questions are answered, while even more questions are born.  I love that these characters are thinkers, that are complex and emotional.  At times I felt they were unreal, but so is this entire society, so it allowed me to give them their reactions.  With a new list of characters, a most surprising direction to the plot, and an ending that leaves me thinking and wanting answers now, I felt that this second novel in the series was a really surprising addition.  I can see that some readers might not like the slow pacing, and might even be upset by some of the twists revealed, but I thought they added a complex layer to the story that will have me eagerly waiting book three.  Now, when does that book come out?!?rising direction to the plot, and an ending that leaves me thinking and wanting answers now, I felt that this second novel in the series was a really surprising addition.

The book is spectacular. The sense of magic is enchanting. The writing is spooky and sweet. The setting sucks you in like a magical Hoover. The characters are perfectly archetypical for film. Now, I suppose, the question that remains is: will the film based on this book be live action or animated?<br /><br />To be honest, it might make a lovely cartoon.

0307595862|5.0|As a fan of the late Steig Larson's, I can tell you that his death left a big hole to fill among the top Scandinavian mystery writers. I can also tell you that Jo Nesbo is working toward filling the gap left by Larson's death.<br /><br />The Snowman is Mr. Nesbo's 7th Harry Hole(pronounced Hole-ee)mystery, but only the 5th to be translated into English. Hole is a Norwegian detective who has previously caught a serial killer in Australia.  He had spent time in the USA learning to recognize and catch serial killers and is the only member of the police to have been taught these skills.<br /><br />The story begins with the death of a young, married mother as the first snow of the season falls in Norway. A boy named Jonas wakes in the middle of the night to find that his mother has disappeared from their home and a snowman has been built in their yard. The snowman is unique in that it faces the house instead of the street and it has Jonas's mother's scarf around her neck. Harry Hole suspects that a serial killer is loose in Norway as research indicates that a dozen married mothers have disappeared over the previous 15 years. All of these women have disappeared on the day of the first snowfall. Harry gathers a team of investigators to catch the killer.<br /><br />Harry has the feeling he is being watched and he can't shake that feeling. He suspects that the killer is someone he knows -- someone who understands police procedures, and is trying to get into his head.  The story twists and turns with numerous suspects and red herrings being developed into the plot.<br /><br />Harry is a tortured soul who is fighting with alcoholism and a tragic past that haunts him. He is still in love with his former girlfriend who left him because of his demons. His reputation among his police colleagues is suspect. Yet, he is dedicated to capturing the killer even if it means putting his life at risk.<br /><br />Nesbo has created a page-turner in this novel. The writing excels, and the plot is well developed and paced. This is a translation from the Norwegian, but I only found one error in the English text. This book is well done and would be a proud addition to any mystery library.<br /><br />The first 2 Harry Hole books are not available in an English translation, but the others are available.

B002RKSXJG|3.0|I feel misled by several of the other reviews here.  Reviewers who stayed up all night reading this book must be vampires -it took me several weeks to get through this.  Not to say it was terrible, but a page-turner it was not.  Though it was easy to see how the wild plot and zany characters made for a Victorian \\"beach read,\\" the poorly executed multiple narrator structure left me cold.  Collins chose the wrong characters to tell his tale and left me yearning for previous narrators or major characters that were never given a voice.  Additionally, the utter banality of Laura made the romantic aspect unsatisfying.  However, The Woman in White is not without its merits--the complex plot is intriguing, several of the characters are fascinating, its progressive (for its time) depiction of women is laudable, and finally, it's funny.

B005RAO0GS|5.0|I always want to say \\"she,\\" but I never know if it's really \\"they.\\"  Anyway... wow!  I had high hopes for this album, \\"Ceremonials,\\" and I am blown away yet again.  I was not sure how she would top her debut album, \\"Lungs.\\"  But I actually enjoy plenty of the songs from \\"Ceremonials\\" more than from \\"Lungs.\\"  Perhaps it's the darkness that really sold me.  When I had read that her new album was going to be a bit darker, I was not sure what to expect (and I love dark music).  I'm not really a fan of gospel music, but I have to admit that the gospel influences in some of the tracks really do blend well.  \\"Only If for a Night,\\" \\"Shake It Out,\\" \\"What the Water Gave Me,\\" \\"No Light, No Light,\\" \\"Seven Devils,\\" and \\"Leave My Body\\" are the standout tracks for me.  I also love the three exclusive tracks from the second disc of the deluxe edition, especially \\"Strangeness and Charm.\\"  I think the execution of this album has soared in comparison to \\"Lungs,\\" and I actually love \\"Lungs.\\"  The first two exposed tracks before the album was released, \\"Shake It Out,\\" and \\"What the Water Gave Me,\\" were great choices, and they were what added to the anticipation of this new project.  It's just a very powerful album, even if it seems a bit slower in tempo than \\"Lungs.\\"  I just cannot think of any professional ways to write the best review, but I can honestly say that \\"Ceremonials\\" is going to be known as a masterpiece sometime in the future, if it hasn't already.  Given what I've written so far, it would be nonsensical to rate this album any lower.  After all, Florence + the Machine is a brilliant artist/band with a unique style and a captivating and powerful vocal.  She/They are officially in my top favorites.

B002VECM4K|5.0|There are many moments in the film where the fantasies of a teenage girl replace the horrors of her day to day existence. Those moments trigger memories of my childhood in the way they feel; they are so much like a memory, a dream or a nightmare. Lee Daniels uses visual pastiche to fill the screen with powerful images and powerful emotions. He blends a documentary style with choice editing in the carefully planned sequences that shows us just enough of the violence and horrors of this young woman's life, without indulging in the details. The details we do witness are like fragments or photographs or frames minimized to their essence and most potent.   This is a masterpiece of inventive filmmaking!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Duets is an albumn of Tony Bennett songs, or the songs he usually performs.  Many of the artists singing duets with him are from other genres of music, but what a delightful surprise hearing them sing those songs with him.  Lady Gaga really showed how talented and versatile she is.  Willie Nelson was such a surprise.  There are 17 different artists joining Tony on this album.  And I enjoyed every one of the artists and the songs.  I have been enjoying it while working around the house, doing paperwork and sometimes just put it on to sit down and listen.  Each time I hear it I enjoy it more, find something i had not heard before.  And all who hear it heard it here immediatley added it to their music collections.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Black Swan bursts onto the screen like a deadly virus or a mad cow disease! It hurls the camera in our faces, twirls the lead ballerina into chaos, despair and psychological turmoil. The film breaks the rules of my expectations as to what I usually define as an outstanding film. It is against my criteria for what I would consider a masterpiece in filmmaking; it splatters images at us like a psychotic action horror film and crashes into walls with dizzying effect like no other film since Schindler's List which made my outstanding five star review seventeen years ago! Black Swan manages to charge even more frenetic energy than most films in this genre; actually what genre is this creative crazy film?   This is an original multi-layered and artistic masterpiece which transcends genres, whose images surpass the story and whose leading actress elevates it to its inevitable conclusion with utter conviction! Bravo for your bravery, Aronofsky!
B005ER6STG|2.0|This is a fact. \\"A Serbian Film\\" is the most disturbing piece of artistry ever put on film. It is beautiful, funny, captivating, campy, terrifying, outrageous, pornographic, depressing, and hauntingly brilliant all at the same time. You will not be the same human being after you watch this. Your life, and outlook on it, will never be the same after viewing it. This is why I beg you to seek out the truly \\"unrated\\" version of this film. The Blu-Ray new release version, although visually amazing thanks to Blu-Ray (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), is what I would let my wife see. If you want the real effect of this film, search out the real uncut version first. It is the only way to fully appreciate the effect the filmmakers were trying to achieve.   \\"A Serbian Film\\" is a film that will be debated about for years. Hate it or love it it is now a part of our existence, like \\"Faces of Death\\" or \\"The Notebook\\". And I don't know about you, but I don't need my hand held through either one. It's just too bad that the idiots who are \\"supposedly\\" in control do. If you don't want to watch it, don't watch it. But if you do, see it how it was supposed to be seen. In all its horrifying glory.
B003UESJHE|5.0|The script is a masterpiece of character development and is brought to the screen with masterful depth by the actors. Tom Hooper has created a visual oeuvre to support the screenplay in The King's Speech that transcends many styles of filmmaking and especially focuses on the grand European cinema of the past. He uses a wonderful depth of field and incredible lighting detail to illuminate the locations with an overwhelming sense of space and at the same time a sense of oppression.   Prince Albert lives in a world where he is oppressed spiritually and his speech stammering oppresses him physically and psychologically. Tom Hooper uses these elements of the story to enhance our film experience through memorable shots and intense points of view. The rooms and halls in the film are filmed with the same intensity you would film the Rockies or the valleys of the Grand Canyon. In many scenes you will be reminded of Citizen Kane, which has that same visual intensity. If there ever was a film that emanates Citizen Kane, King's Speech would be that film.   The director also films simple dialogue where the actors are placed off kilter from the frame and sometimes the effect is used for psychological reasons and other times for an effect that would remind us of modern classical paintings.   It is a beautiful film on every level and a masterpiece for our times.

There are those who are rabidly homophobic regarding people, but this book shows one example of same sex relationships which are not uncommon in nature.

The sounds make her laugh and she gets very excited when you click the keys together. When I hold them close to her she tries very hard to reach out and play with them. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially over real keys which contain pretty high levels of lead in them. I learned that after my first born was 4 months old. Fisher Price Musical Teether Keys Toy is a great buy!
B0030Y10QQ|4.0|The remastering of the older songs is fantastic.  I kind of wish they would have put some more older tunes on this release but it is great!  After I watched the DVD I went out and bought some of the newer releases because I wasn't that familiar with the new Savatage.  I have the complete collection now and just recently bought Hall of the Mountain King, Gutter Ballet, Wake of Magellan, Streets, Sirens, Power of the night all on Digipak 2010-2011 Remasters so look for those because the sound quality is of course greatly improved.  Anyway I got the CD and DVD for 12 dollars and that was a deal!!!  If your into similiar Savatage branches check out Circle to Circle by Zachary Stevens (2nd lead singer of Savatage).  Also Jon Oliva's Pain, Trans Siberian Orchestra.  Ronnie Munroe (Metal Church) now has one of Savatage's old guitar players Chris Caffery so I'm buying that CD next week because it rocks the house!  Chris also has solo work out there.  Rock on Savatage!!!

I hope Amazon will notify us all when it gets in a working set of discs.

0553588486|5.0|This is the first book in the Song of Ice and Fire series (before A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons, The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) and A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)).<br /><br />The story starts in Winterfell, at the end of a long summer, with the Stark family: Lord Eddard and his wife Catelyn, their boys Robb, Bran and Rickon, and daughters Sansa and Arya, as well as Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow, who is about to leave Winterfell to become a brother of the Night's Watch on the Wall, the immense icy structure in the North, which protects the Seven Kingdoms from the wildlings who live beyond it.<br /><br />When the Starks hear that the Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, has unexpectedly died and that King Robert is heading for Winterfell with his family, the cold beauty Queen Cersei Lannister and her two brothers Jaime and Tyrion, and their three children, Eddard knows that his old friend and monarch is going to ask him to fill in the newly vacated position and reluctantly prepares to leave his home, to travel to King's Landing in the South.<br /><br />Eddard has just left Winterfell when Catelyn receives a message from her sister, Lord Arryn's widow, accusing the Lannisters of her husband's murder. From then on, as the intrigue develops, the situation inexorably deteriorates, the tale becomes grim and very violent, heavy with treacheries and injustice.<br /><br />At first I found the book wasn't living up to all the praise, and I was often confused with the plethora of names of lords and ladies, knights and bannermen, maesters and soldiers. But as the story progressed, I grew fond of several characters and suddenly, I was hooked. I particularly like reading about Jon Snow, young Bran, or the tomboy Arya, and Tyrion the Imp si definitely intriguing! All in all, not what I expected but unquestionably worth the read!<br /><br />NB: I made the exception to my sacrosanct rule of not starting a series before the last volume is published because my boy-friend and I wanted to watch the acclaimed TV show (and I wanted to have read the book first). We're currently watching it and I must say it's very faithful to the book most of the time.h the acclaimed TV show (and I wanted to have read the book first).

1878424939|4.0|There is something truly unique about don Miguel Ruiz's \\"The Four Agreements.\\"  While it reads like a cross between a religious text and a science fiction novel, its message is simple, clear and powerful.<br /><br />\\"The Four Agreements\\" is about simplifying and taking ownership of your life.  It's a practical \\"how to\\" guide for casting off the social expectations and standards that you've collected and made \\"fact\\" over the course of your life.  Ruiz coins this web of overlapping societal truths as the dream of the world; suggesting that - just like we have created our own belief system as to what we're capable as individuals - so to have we, as a global entity, created a mass belief that people should act in a certain way and (with rare exception) are only capable of certain things.  Ruiz shares that while this belief system is strong (and widely accepted, making it easier to submit to than to challenge) it is invalid and extremely limiting to us as individuals.<br /><br />Ruiz teaches that the way in which we see and interact with the world is entirely created through thousands and thousands of tiny \\"agreements\\" - situations we experience, form an opinion on and then solidify in our minds as actual fact.  An opinion is not a fact.  It is simply an opinion; one way of viewing the world.<br /><br />So, to clarify an important new term here: Ruiz defines an \\"agreement\\" as an effective \\"thought habit\\"; something you've been told so many times, or repeated to yourself so many times that you believe it to be irrefutable fact.<br /><br />Ruiz hypothesizes that we make and reinforce thousands of these agreements every day and, unfortunately, a lot of them are negative.  We have preconceptions and criticisms of individuals, organizations, events or ideas that we allow to color our experiences.  As an aside, the film \\"Traffic\\" does a great job of exploring this topic  Ruiz suggests that while we have been \\"programmed\\" by thousands of little agreements we've made with ourselves and society, the active pursuit of mastery of four key agreements can counter balance the lot of them.  The purpose of doing so is in creating an \\"authentically you\\" lifestyle.  Think of the timeless bliss of five year olds in play.  Those kids are authentically themselves.  They don't know how to be any other way.  And they're happy.  This is what we're working towards.<br /><br />FAVOURITE TAKEAWAY: Over the course of his smart, quick little book, Ruiz identifies the four key agreements we can make with ourselves that will have the most dramatic impact on the happiness in our lives. Those agreements are as follows: The first agreement is to be impeccable with your word. The second agreement is don't take anything personally. The third agreement is don't make assumptions. The fourth agreement is about the action of the first three: Always do your best.<br /><br />While the agreements themselves are extremely simple in nature, they are also brutally challenging to master.  Society teaches us to gossip.  To criticize.  To cut corners.  To exaggerate or outright lie.  Mastering these four agreements take time, patience and an incredible strong will.  Ruiz's belief, however, is that the effort is worth it.  With these four agreements in place, we can learn to \\"roll back the fog\\" of our existence and live the life we were truly meant to lead, rather than plod along on the path dictated to us by social programming and peer expectation.  While we don't have time to go into all four agreements in detail, here are a couple key thoughts for mastering these agreements.<br /><br />\\"The Four Agreements\\" is different.  While I don't believe this book (and Ruiz's writing style or language) is one that everyone will be comfortable with, I do strongly feel the message is universal and can be lived by everyone.  We do submit to societal pressures and expectations.  Unconsciously, we conform to what the world tells us we should be and do.  We're typically not happy about it, butwe end up blaming everyone else for that - our bosses, our parents, our partner - it's always someone else's fault.  The message of this book is clear - you need to take ownership for your own life and destiny.  You choose the path, and the way you want to live your life.  My personal opinion is that the four agreements are collectively a powerful set of tools for setting you down the right path; your path.  As I said, not for everyone, but powerful stuff for the spiritually inclined.<br /><br />--<br />Visit ActionableBooks for over 170 summaries, author video interviews and easy ways to implement the concepts for managers and their teams.r partner - it's always someone else's fault.

0060763280|4.0|Money is a wonderfully complex topic; one that raises a wide range of emotional responses.  You've most likely heard the old adage that you should \\"never discuss money, politics, sex or religion when in a social setting\\".  Do you know why that is?  The advice is based on the belief that we (in the broadest sense of the word) are so emotionally attached to our beliefs on all four subjects that discussing them in mixed company could easily lead to confrontation.  Fair enough, most of us would probably agree with that.  The real question though, is \\"when and how did we become so emotional about money?\\"<br /><br />Despite the somewhat cheesy title, \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,\\" by T. Harv Eker, is a quick read worth checking out.  The premise of the book is simple; you can learn all the investment, saving or wealth building tips in the world, but if you're not mentally prepared to own and maintain that wealth - unless your \\"financial thermostat\\" is set to a higher amount - the money will go as soon as it arrives.  While even that description may sound a little too \\"warm and fuzzy\\" for some, I found Secrets of the Millionaire Mind to be full of practical and easy to implement concepts, all of which are geared around the goal of mental reprogramming.<br /><br />FAVOURITE TAKEAWAY: Eker suggests that all of our thoughts and beliefs about money come from three sources:  Verbal Programming, Modeling and Specific Incidents.  I'm certainly not a psychiatrist, but it seems these could apply to virtually any aspect of life... but I digress  Eker believes that these three sources create, at a very young age, our attitudes and beliefs when it comes to money.  What he stresses is that our \\"understanding\\" is simply a story; programming that we let ourselves believe to be fact.  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is a book about re-writing that story; creating productive mental \\"files\\" that can be used to replace our current beliefs.<br /><br />\\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\" is a brash, in your face, grossly over simplified comparison of \\"rich people\\" mindsets to \\"poor people\\" mindsets.  Eker is over the top and relentless... and it just might work.  The fact of the matter is these lessons have been taught before and, so long as the majority of North Americans are effectively living the exact opposite principles, they'll be taught some more.<br /><br />If you're not living the financial lifestyle you'd like right now, do yourself a favour and get informed.  Get a coach (even if he's hiding in the pages of a book rather than live) and get started on creating the lifestyle you've always wanted.  If you're not a victim, you're taking charge.  So take charge.  \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\" isn't only informative, it's a heck of a lot of fun, too.  And at the end of the day, isn't that what it's all about?<br /><br />--<br />Visit ActionableBooks for over 170 summaries, author video interviews and easy ways to implement the concepts for managers and their teams.over simplified comparison of \\"rich people\\" mindsets to \\"poor people\\" mindsets.

068817776X|5.0|a good read --a sad story
1451648537|2.0|A jarringly dispassionate act of composition.  Issacson's opus reads like a 10th grader going through the motions of a requisite book report...a boring recitation of facts filled with unremarkable insights, yet remarkably questionable conclusions.   Regarding a particularly pivotal and historic sequence of events, Isaccson summarily concludes \\"it was inevitable that other companies would develop similar graphical interfaces\\", even while previously reporting PARC's 70's GUI creation had languished for more than 10 years as an experimental office system largely dismissed by XEROX management.   Who really knows how the course of history would unfold without Mr. Jobs liberation of the PARC GUI in the late 70's, but it's interesting to note that it took Microsoft over 20 years to make that journey with its introduction of Windows 95, but only after having the benefit of BOTH Xerox PARC's legacy... and Apple's.  If Steve Jobs was indeed the \\"complex man\\" as Isaacson says he was, his writing lacks nuance and depth of understanding for this human being with a surprisingly \\"one-note\\" assessment and incessant use of \\"reality distortion field\\" as critic of Steve Jobs personality. From reading this book, one would be surprised to find out that in reality, Mr. Jobs had any friends at all...  One thing is certain, Mr. Jobs didn't always make perfect decisions, and nothing confirms this more clearly than in his choice for biographer...

There's even backgrounds for Roger Rabbit among many others in here which Ive never seen in any other of my many books.<br />I do notice that a good portion of the reproductions are sadly, not that great- they're good, but Ive seen many of them in other books and there is a definite, noticeable difference in color and value. Also. While at the bookstore I inspected a few of the bindings and many of them were looking a little shaky.<br />It's too bad. I understand its a challenge to get the many pages to print well, it's a lot of art, but they dont have problems with their other art books- and a bindings glue already coming undone on such a brand new copy is one of the worst things to see. A personal pet peeve of mine. The copy I have seems to be ok and holding up, but watch out for those bindings- makes it tough to order from amazon or someone and just hope you get a good one. Cross your fingers.<br />With all that said- its still an amazing, fantastic, and easily accessible collection and I would buy it all over again at full price regardless of those two major disappointments.<br /><br />I twitter about art of books every week for those who are interested, give me a follow or an RT @en_b !

B004EPZ08E|5.0|When I saw Horrible Bosses at the movies earlier this year, I laughed so hard, my face hurt.  I am happy to say it is just as funny watching it at home.  You forget so many of the great scenes, and some of the one-liners that were missed because we were still laughing at an earlier bit.  Easily the funniest film I have seen since the 40-Year-Old Virgin.  And just as inappropriate, if not more.  Jason Sudeikis is my favorite new comedic actor (see also Hall Pass and you'll know him from Saturday Night Live).  Jason Bateman is always a riot and much funnier in this than The Change-Up (also saw that at the movies, and while it had its moments, was a big let down).  Those of you who already watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia will be happy to find Charlie Day at his high-pitched zaniest.  As for the Horrible Bosses themselves, anyone who has ever seen Swimming with Sharks will already know Kevin Spacey plays the perfect boss from hell.  He does the unthinkable by actually topping THAT performance here.  Colin Ferrell is great as the coked out, balding, low-life son of Jason Sudeikis' wonderful boss, Donald Sutherland.  And Jennifer Aniston, my shining little star, THIS is a game changing role for her if ever there was one.  Now here's hoping she gets meatier roles based on this turn.  Yes, this movie is rude, crude and totally inappropriate...and I LIKE it that way.  This film delivers effortlessly while many other movies these days are a let down and try way too hard...only to have the jokes fall flat (see my review of Tropic Thunder and the backlash I have gotten over that, mainly by those with only an 8-year-old's sense of humor who probably would not get most of the jokes on Family Guy).  Also on hand in this film, the always welcome Jamie Foxx, playing a character named M*****F***** Jones -- you got to love that!  And Julie Bowen from Modern Family as Kevin Spacey's hot wife.<br />This version (I bought new off ebay) has the theatrical version, the Blu-ray Totally Inappropriate Version (with 8 minutes of extra footage) and the Digital version, packed with extras such as My Least Favorite Career (where cast discusses their worst jobs ever), Surviving a Horrible Boss, Being Mean is So Much Fun (the horrible bosses discuss their fun playing mean), Deleted Scenes and Making of the Horrible Bosses soundtrack.Inappropriate Version (with 8 minutes of extra footage) and the Digital version, packed with extras such as My Least Favorite Career (where cast discusses their worst jobs ever), Surviving a Horrible Boss, Being Mean is So Much Fun (the horrible bosses discuss their fun playing mean), Deleted Scenes and Making of the Horrible Bosses soundtrack.

Alicia Keys) co-wrote the song Fa La La that's worthy to be on that Boyz II Men's christmas album! It's awesome and the standout original track. But that's not all! Only Thing I Ever Get, All I Want and Christmas Love capture a great holiday \\"love\\" feeling for original tracks as well. I hope some of you enjoy Christmas Interpretations as this album has that R&B vibe and inspiration. Now about the classic covers: The Christmas Song with Usher is awesome vocally with always magical lyrics. Bieber singing the line \\"to kids from one to ninety-two\\" is impeccable. Great guitar solo. Mariah's classic All I Want For Christmas Is You doesn't hurt her original and Bieber adds a male influence that is either welcomed or unwelcomed depending on your taste. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town is fun, even if cheesy, reminding me of the younger Bieber (as he is more mature on this album vocally which sounds better to me.) Silent Night is very sincere and syrupy sweet again reminding me of the younger Bieber but it fits very well because it's about what christmas is all about: our savior's birth. Fa La La (Acapella) is just amazing vocally (c'mon Boyz II Men are just outstanding vocalists any year and Bieber holds his own with them...lol). Drummer Boy is the only track I would \\"skip or delete\\"  because it just doesn't fit with the flow of the album in my opinion. Great vocal and writing effort by Justin and the deluxe edition is recommended for Fa La La (Acapella) and Christmas Love. I'll surely be listening to songs like Fa La La and The Christmas Song every holiday and that's the goal anyone releasing a holiday album wants right?
1423140591|5.0|I love the first Percy jackson series, and if you do too you'll love this one too. Minor characters from the first series even make an appearance. Its also educational on the Greek and Roman Gods and how culture changed Gods and mythology

B005ILWOZA|5.0|When I picked up my new \\"People\\" Magazine today, I went to the music reviews and was excited, so excited, to see that James Morrison has released his third album.  I would have ordered his new CD without hearing a single track from it, but instead listened to the samples that Amazon shares with their customers.  I sat, my ears tuned in to every word, wanting to hear more of each song, and then without hesitation, hit the \\"add to cart\\" button.  I cannot wait to get James' new CD and probably will wear it out as I have his last two.  It's unbelievable to me that he has not been highly recognized in the US, he's such a huge talent, but believe me, I will do my best to spread the word about him!  Thank you, James, for your talent, voice and soulful songwriting!
1401233376|4.0|Imagine waking up at your job and you hear that your nemesis Captain Cold is a law-abiding citizen? Or what about Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father being Batman and alive? Superman not being around and cyborg is the national hero? Abin Sur never died, so Hal Jordan never received his power ring?  Aquaman sinking Western Europe and Wonder Woman taking over England as New Themyscira...and yet there both fighting each other? What about your dead mother...being alive and well? And weirdly enough, you don't have your powers here!<br /><br />This is the setup for Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, who wakes up unknowingly to this unique place/timeline at the beginning of this new world, called Flashpoint.  Flashpoint is set in a modern world that is an accumulation of the DC, Vertigo, and Wildcats Universes--but altered, with many characters having various arrays of different properties, either it be personalities, ideologies, looks, or all of thee above.  Characters like Thomas Wayne, who is very much like Bruce, but is more ruthless about taking justice out to his enemies, to the point he's willing to kill them.  Cyborg is the new Superman of this world, where everyone looks up to him as a hero and trusts his word.  Even SHAZAM is called Captain Thunder here, who is made up of six different teenagers with conflicting opinions.  Added to all that, Aquaman and his Atlantians and Wonder Woman and her Amazonians are at war with each other, which could very well destroy this new place that The Flash just got stuck into without any prior knowledge of how he got here.  Even worse, is that Barry has to get out of this universe soon or else his prior memories from his universe will be over written into new memories for this new Flashpoint universe.  Talk about being stuck up a creek!<br /><br />Put simply, Flashpoint is a Back to the Future Part II-type story.  Now since Flashpoint is similar to that concept of alternative timelines, with that in mind, one should expect to have various questions regarding this story.  I'll try to keep it spoiler free for people, if I haven't already.<br /><br />First of all, Flashpoint is a DC wide Event focused on changing year's worth of DC continuity into the current New DC 52 timeline. First, one event is made up of the main storyline itself, called Flashpoint.  This very book is the center of the event that will lead into the New 52 timeline, and focuses primarily on relationship between The Flash and Batman (Thomas Wayne). This event also has fragments of the Flashpoint world, so the main event should be treated like a commentary track to the entire event. You don't need other books to complete this, but the event is rather shallow without the finer details.  Then there is \\"The World of Flashpoint\\" books, which are books that go into greater details of the supporting characters involved throughout the flashpoint event. These books are not necessary, but add depth and layers to the overall event.  Put simply: Flashpoint is the essential story, while everything else under the \\"World of Flashpoint\\" titles are supplemental, and not necessary for enjoying the main title.  For example SPOILERS: In the flashpoint title, Lois Lane is feeding information to the Resistance. The Resistance is led by Grifter, who finds Lois Lane in London.  They show up later in the book with Resistance at the fight between the Atlantians and Amazonians for 1 page.  After that we never see them again. Now this might seem like useless filler and be confusing to include in the main title, but I don't mind this.  I get the idea there are multiple fractions across the globe fighting off Aquaman and WW's armies, so seeing a snippet of those forces doesn't through me off the main story.  It's just a small fragment of the whole event, without taking me out of the main plot.  Now if you want to expand upon what happened with Lois Lane and what the Resistance have been doing, as well as how they got to the Altantian/Amazonian fight, just pickthat WOFP book to learn more.  Another example is Hal Jordan.  Hal never received his ring in FP, so he never became a Green Lantern, so he's still the Air Force.  He is the first pilot of the US forces to lead the attack on Aquaman and WW, but is killed in action.  I get the fact of who Hal is now, what he's doing, and what becomes of him in 1 page of the FP main title. I don't really need further explanation, BUT...you can choose to further expand on his other endeavors in his WOFP book.  That's the beauty of FP: the main title stays within its boundaries, and WOFP simply adds layers to event, while not being necessary to read. It's not like Blackest Night, where it needed Green Lantern: Blackest Night to fill in the holes to make it complete.<br /><br />The only confusing aspect you should look out for is...sorry if I seem like I'm giving things away, but the main villain is Reverse-Flash.  He makes himself known he's behind this event in issue #2, but you won't find out why until the very end.  Anyway, his explanation near the end is rather confusing unless you've been following The Flash titles, and even then, you might have to re-read those titles to understand how he's even here and how he's become who he is. [[ASIN:1401232795 Flash Vol. 2: The Road to Flashpoint (Flash (DC Comics))]] ends with the setup to Flashpoint though, but other than that, FP is self-contained enough of an event where you really don't need to read that(just to let you know).<br /><br />Now just because I feel the main event is self-contained, doesn't mean some people might not feel that way.  Many might feel the WOFP books should still be put into the FP title to be cohesive and make a complete title.  But since those books are long and, again not essential to the main story, I'm fine with this book as it is.<br /><br />The other thing people might have an issue is the length.  Flashpoint is a mere 5 issue collection.  For an event that has to do something this radical, like changing 70+ years of DC story telling into a new era...people might feel let down.  Even I felt 5 issues were too short. The first 3 issues are slow buildups (with issue 3 getting a certain sub character out of prison, which is another weird sub-plot in the main title) with issue 4 getting into a world war and issue 5 concluding the event.  I felt it should have gone another issue (maybe a 7th issue), considering the event sort of hurdles along after issue 3. An event this big could have done some more proper length, but a part of me enjoyed the shortness of the event.  Looking back on titles like [[ASIN:1563897504 Crisis On Infinite Earths]] [[ASIN:1401210600 Infinite Crisis]] and [[ASIN:140122282X Final Crisis]] which were long and about cleaning up years continuity, it felt sort of nice to keep things not so long.  And unlike those titles, where they had to explain loose ends to go into other new territories, FP keeps it simple by starting out in an alternative timeline and wipes the slate clean going into the New 52. Coupled with the fact FP stays on the topic of the main story of Barry and Thomas Wayne throughout, makes the book that more on track and enjoyable.  But again, opinion toward who feel the grandeur of FP should be longer and ambitious, as opposed to those (like myself) who feel its short and to the point will vary.<br /><br />Now for my verdict: I would have given the book 4 and a half stars, but couldn't.  It doesn't quite deserve 5 stars because some might not like the event and how it feels shallow without all the other WOFP books, as well as being a little too short for a book changing years of DC legacy into a new timeline.  Plot lines introduced that probably didn't need to be introduced here also bring the score down.<br /><br />But Flashpoint, even with the majority of my review focusing on the length and the importance of main title being essential to the whole FP event, I felt it was a fun book.  It should be treated as Flash/Batman story with everyone else being secondary characters that fill in the world much better (if you want to expand upon that in other books).  It tells the important aspects of the story when needed too, without over doing side stories and stays on topic.  And the best thing I saved for last, and is easily the best thing about this book is the ending.  The last 6 pages where the story hits emotionally for Flash fans and especially Batman fans is worthy of picking this book up alone.  It's just amazing.  Even I had a moment where I had to pause and take in the two different scenes.  But you should pick this up for the importance this book has ushering in the New 52. Who knows? This might be a template for years to come when one era of comics went into another era.  How graceful it turns out years from now will vary greatly.0+ years of DC story telling into a new era...people might feel let down.  Even I felt 5 issues were too short.

B005HEEFH8|1.0|I have always enjoyed the 'Old' Star Trek series and there were some I enjoyed more than others. Having said that, I think it's a shame that the individual episodes are not being made available for download.
B004SQS9FA|4.0|I'm always curious and almost a little frustrated with how many people seem to hate this album... I think maybe a lot of people need to get over the fact that Radiohead isn't going to make another OK Computer...  they already made it...  and it was awesome.    as for the King of Limbs, while it maybe could have used a couple more of the amazing b-sides that are out there (Daily Mail, Staircase, Supercollider, the Butcher etc.), it's a really solid album, and I like it a lot.   standout tracks: Lotus Flower, Codex, Give Up The Ghost, Separator.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I am not going to waste time on a long review.  This album sounds simply bad and unfinished if you are a Metallica fan from the early time. Hard to see the link between Lulu and ...And Justice For All.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I recently purchased this product because I am on the go a good amount of the time. This allows me to bring my console along and keep up to date with modern gen games. All in all I find it to be exactly what I needed. As some of the other reviewers I was a bit unsure at first of the 15.5 inch display. It is bigger than I thought and in no time I was easily headshotting my way through Uncharted. I tossed a few fast paced games at it just to see how it handled them and I'm pleased to say it handled them like a champ. Audio can sound a little thin at times, almost tinny I guess you could say. But that is easily fixed using my Astro Mixamp and a quality pair of headphones. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone in the market for a mobile entertainment system for their console.
1250004217|4.0|My hotel in Paris in September was not far from where Velodrome d'Hiver stood in 1942. I wonder how many times I walked by but didn't see the plaque honoring the Jews cruelly kept there and then sent to death camps. If I had read Sarah's Key at the beginning of September, I would have sought out the plaque. But not knowing about the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup until now, I will be haunted by my inadvertent ignoring of so tragic a part of the Holocaust. Thanks to Tatiana de Rosnay for weaving the story of young, brave Sarah Starzynski, haunted by what happened to her in July 1942, into the story of a modern-day journalist and her cross-cultural family. Sarah's Key is a riveting story, one I'll never forget.
B004LROOUK|1.0|I was really excited to get this travel guide from the preview, but upon purchase I am sorely disappointed.  The layout of the ebook is great, the links are intuitive, and the look of the book is generally pleasing.  BUT the maps are completely unreadable.  I am using the ipad2 version of Kindle and aside from seeing the lines of roads and train lines on the map images, you cannot read most of the text on the maps.  How can you release a book when it's illegible?    So let this warning to any future buyers; all the reviews i saw were for the paperback version, not the kindle version.  I find this to be completely unacceptable for the price I paid.  I'm really not sure how this can be considered a travel guide when you clearly can't use the maps for guidance.  Please at least update the graphics to something readable, not some low grade 5k image of an important map.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|very nice clean design and smooth game. it runs perfect ot my Samsung galaxy tab 10.1! u cam play vs a friend or a CPU with different levels of difficulties. only things missing is playing vs someone online
B003Y5H53S|1.0|The title of this review says it all. Cute story, but I was suprised at the language in this show. Not to mention the topless Barbie at the very beginning. Yes, I realize topless Barbies do not look exactly like topless women, but it is very suggestive for little kids. My oldest (10) looked at us oddly with some of the language and barbie scenes in this show--if he knows it is inappropriate, then obviously it is. I suggest watching this before you let your kids watch it.
B004LROUW2|1.0|The biggest selling point of the Kindle system is the ability to read the same book on multiple Kindle supported devices while maintaining your current location. This book doesn't support this.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This was the worst album I have ever had to pay for... Just goes to show my GF has no taste in music!
B000EZ7ZXQ|4.0|As the movie starts it gives a feeling of just another story of promiscuous behavior in a beautiful setting, Hawaii, but as it continues and the Drew Barrymore character, Lucy Whitmore, is introduced it suddenly becomes more significant and meaningful. The Adam Sandler character, Henry Roth, begins to develop some depth as a human being as he discovers the plight of the very lovely Lucy, begins to see her as something more than a sex object, and develops a concern for someone other than himself.<br /><br />The movie takes place in Hawaii with all of the beautiful scenery you would expect in that locale. The casting is well done with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler both creating sympathetic characters about whom the viewer begins to care. The supporting roles are all performed with competence so that the total package is very rewarding.<br /><br />Both the sound and video on the Blu-ray version are excellent so there are no complaints in that department.<br /><br />There is course language and sexual innuendo especially in the beginning of the movie, and some scattered throughout but the later scenes are handled with less crudity. All told it is a satisfactory movie although I can't recommend it for young children especially the first few minutes of the movie.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I beat \\"Lungs\\" to death on rotation, but wasn't sure how she would/could follow it up.  Well!    \\"Ceremonials\\" is as elegant and majestic as the title suggests, a thundering sophomore album.  From the first notes you know you're in for something special, dare I say leonine.  \\"Only If For A Night\\" grabs you by the heart with five fingers extended to grip, and \\"Shake It Out\\" squeezes all the harder.  She never lets go from start to finish.  There's not a dull or filler song on here, but the mood and energy remain consistent, soaring.  Listening to this album is like flying.  More refined, polished, and unified sonically than \\"Lungs\\", not only does this prove that Florence is no flash in the pan, it reinforces that she wears the crown in the UK music scene.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Well, I've now listened to LULU 4 times through. The first time I heard the early snippet of the song THE VIEW I thought, \\"Uh-Oh!\\". Then, I heard the whole thing and decided I wanted to hear the entire CD. The first time through was a chore, since I rarely sit and listen to ANY music for 90 minutes straight, but I did enjoy it, though Lou Reed's voice sounded irritating in spots. Then, I listened to LULU a second and third time, and heard the music and lyrics together and individually. By the fourth listen, I was completely hooked! It reminded me of some bizarre / beautiful hybrid of Alan Ginsberg, Black Sabbath, and some insane street preacher! LULU is at once brilliant and profane, hypnotic and disturbing. Basically, there are only two kinds of art, the kind you like and the kind you don't. I love this piece of art! Unsatisfied fans of Lou Reed and / or Metallica need not worry, as each will put out their own, separate material soon anyway...
B005DZMODI|2.0|I love the horn playing of Wynton Marsalis. He's so talented. When I bought the Marsalis & Clapton CD I was very disappointed to hear the poor music in my opinion. I will never buy another Marsalis & Clapton duet again.
1451648537|1.0|I want to save you the time so here's a one line piece of advice: grab it from your library instead of buying it and you'll thank yourself later.  Like many people, I pre-ordered this book, read it as soon as it came and was very disappointed. The book is literally a description of events in chronological order. If you are the type that reads the news, especially tech news, you'll learn very little here. There is no attempt at analysis and the author never bothered to ask Steve (or his colleagues, friends or even his wife and kids) \\"Why?\\". If anything, it proves that the author Isaacson is a terrible interviewer. It takes great skill to draw out from a human being his/her motivations and reasoning. I expect a biographer to possess that skill. Unfortunately, Isaacson has done nothing more than compile a large number of facts and put them together in order of Apple product releases. You'll find yourself saying \\"Is that all Steve was?\\" because he comes across as an extremely shallow person.  Perhaps the issue lies in Isaacson's view of Steve Jobs' place in history. Elsewhere, he's speaks of Einstein and Jobs as being comparable. I wish I'd read that before.  This is really just a terrible piece of work.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|First off if you're of the opinion that Megadeth hasn't released anything good since, insert era, then don't bother.  If you haven't liked the last 3 albums, then you probably won't like this either.    I've been a Megadeth fan since the mid 90's.  I like to love pretty much every album, except Risk, and give them all at the very least passing grades, except Risk.  Even Risk I don't dislike because it's different.  I hate it because it's a bad sellout album, and even then, I managed to find a few ok songs, 1 good one out of that mess.  I've listened to this album a few times now, and am listening to it again as I write this.  And so far all I can say is wow.  Albeit uneven, this has been a great year for music.  All the good albums seem to come out in bunches.  Stratovarius, Foo Fighters, Pagan's Mind, Divinefire, In Flames, Hammerfall, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Machine Head, Redemption, essentially Fates Warning, Iced Earth and now this.  I haven't been this pleased with a Megadeth album since Youthanasia, again like the others, but this one is just awesome.  My only real complaint is the production isn't quite what I would've wanted, guitars could've been heavier, and Dave's vocals could've used some room to breathe.  But they've been doing that with vocals on albums, with most bands for years.  And, none of that ruins this stellar album.  Dave seemed to put extra attention to song writing, and he did a very good job, better than he has in a long time.  The guitar work is outstanding, as it has been on each of Megadeth's comeback albums, post risk.  And also as you'd expect since most of their pre risk albums had great guitar work too.  The drumming is solid, and it's nice to have the other Dave back.  Now if Mustaine can keep this lineup together, I think they could challenge for best Megadeth lineup ever.  Also Dave's vocals probably aren't at their best, not their worst either, but maybe that'lll grow on me too.  He makes up for it with killer songwriting though.  As I said this year's provided some great albums.  Untill last year's Sevendust album it'd been years since I found an album that I loved on first listen, and I ended up not being too fond of the Sevendust one.  This year I've found several, Symphony X, Machine Head, and the Sevendust incident is NOT repeating itself with these.  this is yet another that I loved on first listen, and still love now, on my fourth or so listen.  Glad I can use an ipod at work.  Oh I do have one other complaint, including New World Order, Sudden Death and Black Swan, seriously messed up my version of Risk, which also hads One Thing and Crown Of Worms, and Kill The King.  Still these versions sound fantastic, and I just removed the old ones from Risk, and re ordered the tracks, so it's not that big of a deal.  Heck I prefer this to remaking songs again, like A Tout Le Monde, and Hanger 18.  Hey maybe as a random project between albums Dave could completely redo Risk and just stop making the original, and make it a metal album.  I can dream.  Still this is kind of old school.  I don't listen to the radio anymore, so I don't usually know anything on new releases by bands I like, course there's youtube which saved me from the Queensryche fiasco, but still.  Having these 3 songs made it like back in the day when I'd know a couple songs on an album before getting it.  Overall there's not a bad song on the album.  Sure you'll like some more than others, I'm sure I will, already do.  I can say I enjoy this front to back, no skipping.  So far here's my rankings of the songs, but this is subject to change.  Sudden Death 8/10 starts with a slower intro that builds to a faster verse, and a slower, yet heavy chorus that picks up speed.  Overal it's a pretty good song.  I think I would've gone with a different song for the opener.  Public Enemy Number ! 8/1-0 love the verses, very fast, semi old school Megadeth sounding, Iron Maiden sounding galloping guitar riff, with a nice build up to the chorus.  The chorus slows in pace, still stays heavy.  So far the chorus sounds like it could use some work, but it's got enjoyability, so I'll forgive that.  Plus it may grow on me.  Whose Life It This Anyway 10/10 absolutely love this song.  Fast paced metal goodness with a catchy chorus.  What else could you want?  We The People 8/10 easily the slowest song, to this point, still heavy though.  Dave goes political again, which is fine.  Decent melodies, although Dave's voice sounds kind of weird in the chorus.  Still a definite must for any Megadeth fan.  Guns Drugs And Money 8/10, how can you not like a song with this title?  Don't answer that.  This one's an upper tempo heavy song.  Nice vocals on the verses.  Nice chorus, I may be upping this rating later.  Never Dead 9/10 another fast paced metal classic in the making with a catchy chorus.  If i needed convincing to like this album, which I didn't, this song would have done that.  New World Order 9/10 oh I'm so use to this being track 1 on Risk.  Eh whatever.  This one starts with a heavy riff before a more melodic verse, which is slower.  It has an interesting tempo to it.  then a nice riff before the chorus.  Love this song, and the remake sounds fantastic, definite improvement.  There's a nice fast paced instrumental section with a solid solo.  Fast Lane 7/10 starts with a nice heavy intro complete with some double bas drum work.  The song is pretty up tempo.  The verses are pretty good.  The chorus is lacking a bit, hence the lower ranking, but it's still a pretty solid track.  Black Swan 8/10 is another up tempo rocker.  This one was recorded, don't know if they re recorded it for this album or used the original, for the United Abominations album, for some reason they went with a remake over this, which makes no sense, but whatever.  it's Dave's band and he can do whatever he wants.  Either way it's on an actual Megadeth album now.  This is a pretty decent song.  I only heard it for the first time earlier this year anyways, so I don't have the history I do with New World Order.  Overall a very nice song.  Wrecker 9/10 is another up tempo rocker.  the \\"You'll wreck it,\\" part may be too repetitive for some people, but it doesn't bother me.  Good vocal melodies, with solid musicianship.  Yet another solid addidion to Megadeth's catalog.  Millennium Of The Blind 8/10 I never heard the original to this one.  This is the first ballad of the album, and it comes all the way at the end.  The first verse starts with some clean guitars and Dave's snarling vocals, and gets a bit heavier as it gets closer to the chorus.  The second verse flows a little better, with drums and such.  Overall a very sinister sounding song.  The chorus could probably use a bit of work, but still it's a good song.  Deadly Nightshade 8/10 is the last rocker on here, up tempo and has a groove to it.  The verses are solid, with a nice riff, and good drum beat.  The chorus is solid as well.  13 8/10 is another ballad, but a good way to end the album.  It starts with some acoustic guitars and the electric fades in.  the first verse is acoustic with Dave's vocals and drums, bas and electric guitars layer in as it builds towards the chorus.  Yeah I know, I gave it another 8.  So what?  The chorus isn't as caatchy, but I really like it.  There's some nice acoustic work in between the first chorus and second verse.  I love the layering of acoustic and electric guitars.  Overall this is probably, so far, my favorite Megadeth album since Youthanasia, at least the most consistent.  I hope it stays that way until the next release, and somehow I doubt I'll be getting tired of it anytime soon.  If you like most of their material then definitely pick it up, if you only like the 80's stuff, well then give up already.  This is a great album worth any Megadeth fan's attention, and possibly my vote for album of the year, but time will tell on that one.  Either way this is a solid entry into the megadeth discography.

0385535139|4.0|The Litigators has so much going for it, the usual well-drawn, quirky characters that Grisham does so well, and the realism of life as a lawyer, the only flaw I could find in the story is the pace.  The situation just didn't grab me that way Grisham's last book, the Confession did.  I enjoyed the book immensely while reading it, but I didn't 'have' to pick it up and finish it like I did with The Confession.  Now that book had me going until the last page, and I cried at the ending, something I haven't done since Bridges of Madison County.<br /><br />The Litigators takes us into the high-moneyed, risky world of litigation, something we read about in the papers, but we can't really see what goes on behind the scenes.  John Grisham takes us behind the scenes in a wonderful way.  In the Litigators we see the firm of Finley & Figg welcome David Zinc into their firm, after Zinc literally stumbles into their office while on a one-day bender.  Zinc is a young, Harvard educated lawyer who's just spent 5 years of his life, a prisoner of a giant law firm whose idea of a part-time worker is 50 hours a week.  Zinc nearly has a nervous breakdown one day on his way up the elevator to his job, so he jumps out of the elevator and walks into a bar and proceeds to celebrate his new-found freedom.<br /><br />Zinc stumbles into Finley & Figg and decides in his drunken state, that this is where he now wants to work.  They take him in, and soon Zinc is working for real people, with real problems, for no money, and his loves it.<br /><br />I loved the characters in this book, Rochelle, the 'office manager' was my favorite.  John Grisham is a best-selling novelist for a reason.  He is a keen observer of human nature, and has the talent to put these two dimensional characters on the page, where they spring to life in three dimension for the reader.  The only reason I gave this book less than 5 stars is because Grisham has set the bar for his work so high, yet I'm always happy to pick up any new work he has to offer.new work he has to offer.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|this watch is great, complete mechanical movement, worth much more than what i paid for it - awesome value, looks good too
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|As a diverse music lover, this is wonderful CD.  Simply...Kelly can flat out sing, and a beautiful voice she does have.  My favorite songs are:  Dark Side, Honestly, Breaking Your Own Heart, Don't You Wanna Stay and Why Don't You Try (iTunes).  Hope someday Kelly puts out a CD compiled of more ballads, R&B and Country...to hear her true talents...but her fan base dictates more commercial / mainstream songs.  If you get a chance to see her live, do not miss the opportunity.  Her acoustic set is alone worth the price of the ticket.  Enjoy!!!
0684801558|3.0|The book is ok for its price. But the cover is kinda ugly. It's not the same as the picture.
B005IZLPMY|2.0|First of all, I'm a big superhero, comic book movie fan.  I love Batman and Superman.  I also like X-Men and Iron Man.  I really thought this movie would be awesome, but the plot is thin.  The action scenes become exhausting to watch and seem to make up the bulk of the movie.  It also doesn't tie into modern day until the very end, which made it that much less interesting.  I watched Thor after this and thought it was a way better movie.
1451648537|5.0|I like this book!! this book is extremely good! I buy this book for myself. I admire steve jobs! Hardcover is also very perfect!  this is what I want to read!
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Just go out and  buy it..I'm not getting into this dosn't sound like this record or that record..It's freckin' Megadeth, enough said..It ROCKS that's all you people need to know..
B000ADWDF2|5.0|When I saw this with Jake Gyllenhall and Tobey Maguire (BROTHERS) I was unaware that it was a remake of a Danish movie. On the special features, it showed previews and interviews on this version. So, I went to Amazon and here it is. I won't mind the English subtitles. Director Sheridan did a good remake and enough differences to make you want to see both versions.
0440238609|3.0|Like the title of the series, very dark. I would compare this to being the darker version of the Chronicles of Narnia, perhaps even the prequal to the Mist series/games. But full of adventure, and much more female oriented.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|......and totally unexpected.  I've seen the negative comments about too much sex - and they have a point, there were probably a couple more sex scenes than were necessary to get across the point that the two main characters had the hots for one another, but they were done in a tasteful manner.  This is not anything approaching soft porn.  That aside, though, I found this to be a very moving story that unfolded in a completely believable way, and I had no idea that Anne Hathaway had the dramatic acting depth that she demonstrated in this flick.  I thought she was fantastic in this.  If you're looking for the perfect movie, this isn't it.  It has a few flaws, but overall I really enjoyed it - and my guess is that most other people will too.
0316098329|5.0|Well written,  sad,  inspiring at the same time.  As a mother, I can relate and admire the mother in this story.
B00005QBUK|5.0|These are NOT $100+ headphones. So why do people expect anything more than a $10 set of headphones??? For that money, (cost) these produce a fantastic range of sound. They are light, and yes, they are NOT extremely durable (again they cost under $10!). They do have an adjustment to stay on your head. I have had no problem with them staying on my head, more of one side or the other not staying in an ear. Still, these are quite a BANG for the buck.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|WHAT AN EXCELLENT CD!!!  I LOVED IT!!! STEVIE NICKS IS SO WONDERFUL!!! THE SHIPPING WAS FAST!!!  ONE PROBLEM: THE CD CASE HAD A CRACK ABOUT 3 INCHES ON THE FRONT OF THE CASE. THE PACKAGING HAD NO PROTECTION (LIKE BUBBLE WRAP)-JUST SHIPPED IN CARDBOARD BOX. I TAPED THE CRACK ON THE CASE SO IT WOULDN'T CRACK FURTHER. SINCE THIS CD HAD JUST CAME OUT I WASN'T HAPPY THAT THE CASE WAS CRACKED, BUT ANY CASE SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVED AS CRACKED.  BUT I LOVED THE MUSIC, LOVE STEVIE NICKS
1609611543|5.0|MUST BUY AND READ BOOK!!!  You must read this book and take his advice.  Quit eating grain-based products.  I only use almond and coconut flour.  His writing style is great and the book flows easily.  Wake up America, quit eating starch!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|\\"Temple Grandin\\" is about this woman who designed these corrals and such for the meat packing industry. I first heard about her about 15 years ago when she was unsurprisingly the darling of NPR for a time. At that time my favorite was when one commentator quipped how she was developing special, humane facilities for animals \\"so we could eat them\\". :)  The thing this movie does real well is to depict her creative process, the way she had of visualizing things (ie. thinking \\"in pictures\\"), which I had no prior imaginings of. Claire Danes was also brilliant in the role. I really liked the way she described how she could see the whole thing in her mind (becoming super animated), and be able to convince a bunch of businessmen as well as good ol' cow hands (pretty amusingly done, as well). The conclusion, an impromptu presentation to a group of parents of autistic children, is supremely climactic.  And hearing one guy refer to one of her creations as a \\"masterpiece\\" after seeing it demonstrated also reminded me of some of my software design skills developed unexpectedly in the last 5 years, another bit of anecdotal evidence leading me to wonder about my own possible autistic leanings.  Depictions like this movie seem to lend credence that normal functioning type people are the true cripples. All they seem to have is a \\"way to get along\\", without actually being able to make or do anything.  Sometimes appearances can be deceiving.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I have been a Metallica fan for 20 years.  I never believed this group could ever find a way to make worse music than St Anger, but I was wrong.  Lou Reed's lyrics and voice are off the charts terrible.  What's worse is that the riffs and drums in the background sound pretty good - but the choice to partner with Lou Reed was a horrible decision.  I wouldn't waste a dime on this album - buy \\"Live at Grimey's\\" for that money instead (I bought it last week and their performance is what you'd expect).    Instead of buildng on the momentum of Death Magnetic, they have gone in a completely crazy direction.  Tragic results from a band that is capable of making beautiful metal music 25+ years on.  Oh well, let's hope they get it right in the next round!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  From the first page, it pulls you in and its hard to put down.  It is written beautifully and its very easy to get lost in the book .
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Recently purchaced Sons of Anarchy Season two on Dvd. Series was unopened and as described. Shipping was super fast and I had to wait all day to open it because it was a gift for my husband. Excellent price will do business again! Thanks.
1400049628|1.0|As a member of the living impaired community, I found this book perpetuated many hateful sterotypes of the recently deceased.  First of all, we are not brainless.  Indeed, I had fully three brains this morning for breakfast.  Second, the overall tone of the book: brutual intolerance.  The living impaired merely enjoy an alternative lifestyle in which we feed upon the organs of hated tropes within the social behaviors of teen movie culture. Don't de-capitate me.  If you've got a beef, let's sit down in the same room and you can really give me a piece of your mind.  Your yummy delicious blood-filled mind. BRAINS!!!
B005HPA2XI|3.0|Bad producer fit , great musicians still , a bit more progressive yet stripped down in some ways , and yet seems to be many elements from CTS and BM rolled together here.  Not quite sure what to make of this album , don't love it nor do I hate it but , I feel the guys in Mastodon might have another album left in them before they go there separate ways to fulfill their personal wishes as musicians.  Bands consisting of members with somewhat widely contrasting ideas that are able to mesh it and have it make sense is beautiful but , everything has it's time and place and expiration date , I have a feeling Mastodon as a group is coming to that point where the guys in this band must move on and do their own things musically.  I loved CTS , BM , and Leviathan , Remission was okay so I am differing in my opinions of Mastodon compared to most hardcore fans because they mostly all love Remission where I don't.  But , something is missing on many of the songs on this album and I can't put my finger on it.  Only thing I can make of it is eventually \\"too many chefs in the kitchen will spoil the soup\\".  Mastodon is great and always will be but , their best days creatively as a band I have a feeling are behind them , it was a great run!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence + The Machine blow us all away once again, fantastic sophomore album. So much depth and inspiring lyrics. I love this album and any fan of this band should check out this record.  Best Tracks..  If Only For A Night  Shake It Out  What The Water Gave Me  Never Let Me Go  No Light, No Light  Spectrum  Remain Nameless
0143038419|4.0|This is a book that made me feel free... made me feel that I was invincible. When you feel that your days have just gotten bleak and dark because of things going on around you, pick this book up and take a peak at what it has to offer. This book is not a romance, action, suspense, mystery, or murder novel, this novel is based on a women whose life that seemed so perfect (wealth, husband, job she loved) fell apart in a matter of weeks. This the story about her traveling to 3 different areas in the world to help focus more on herself and make her at peace by only worrying about her for once and get her life in order.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|With WB changing from a real digital copy (Deathly Hallows Pt. 1) to a streamed copy (Deathly Hallows Pt. 2) users of Apple mobile products will be left out in the cold since there are currently no apps that will play it; not to mention in three years time you will be forking out more money to WB just to watch it again if the service hasn't folded by then.  Save the $10 over the BluRay version, which I just canceled my order for or the $2 over the DVD version, do yourself a favor and just buy Pt. 2 from the iTunes store.  It is the same digital quality as the real digital copy from Pt. 1 plus you get the iTunes extras.  WB's practices are driving this customer away from Amazon.  Sorry Amazon.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|In my opinion (Which alot of you will disagree with...) I enjoyed Breaking Dawn the most out of the 4 books in the series. It had suspense, romance, action, and an amazing amount of imagery. I was so sad when I had finished the book because I kept wanting to read more. All 3 of the twilight books felt like just parts that were leading up to Breaking Dawn. This book is almost every genre in ONE book. Get ready for the ride of your life!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Have the David Attenburg version (don't know why but did not like the other narration as much).  Any ways it is truely a great and breath taking documentary.  Stunning visuals, great camera work just amazing.
B005KMX866|5.0|What a fun, invigorating CD!  With Chris Isaak's unique voice and style on these wonderfully written songs, the double CD set is worth every cent.  Great to play while exercising--you'll be singing along with the fun lyrics and turn this CD is one of duets!  Recommend.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Thank you for getting the Tranformer: Dark of the Moon to me so fast. The Tranformer sagas are favorite movie series. Thanks again
B001HN6922|1.0|I was very surprised by the amount of automobile \\"deaths\\" and threat of \\"deaths\\" in the film. This is violent and terrible to show a 4 year old and having to explain about the good cars versus the bad cars. Please don't watch this movie if you care about your young ones.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoy this book. Great information about a true innovator of my lifetime. It's a good read for anyone who wants an inside look at how Apple started and became what it is today.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Love the show but I was on the edge of my seat waiting for this to arrive and the first shipment just dropped off the world.  The tracking did not update and no dvd was forthcoming. I used Amazon customer service and they sent out a replacement right away.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|The package arrived and the box set was in great condition. I placed a disc and started watching until the episode froze and the whole disc started churning in my dvd player. I waited a bit and no luck... So I decided to try the episode after it and to my surprise, it didn't work either. I watched the episode following those two episodes which works. I don't believe that buying a box set should be this troublesome. Up to now around 6 episodes don't work from random discs throughout season 1 and 2; that's excluding seasons 3-8. Really REALLY irritated...
B00511PTWM|3.0|Edit : after using this for about 3 weeks I'm revising my rating to 3 stars.  Not much to say about the functionality of the product. It does what it is supposed to - which is to split one vehicle lighter socket into two. There's a grey button near where it bends. Press on it, and you can adjust the angle of the two output sockets. A red LED shows you it is powered. And I really like Amazon Frustration Free packaging. It even comes with a small booklet if you need instructions for this.  The design could be improved, however. Used in my car, the plug side extends too far out of the vehicle socket, and wobbles a lot. Occasionally it'll get bumped slightly and stop providing power to the devices, so you need to occasionally glance at the power LED to make sure it is connected. The sockets do not come with a cover. Not an issue if you're using both of them all of the time, but if not, it looks like a prime spot for dust, lint, etc. to accumulate. It would also be nice if it were fused. At least, I assume it is not - I don't see any indication of one. I'd rather change a fuse on this than on the car itself.  There's less expensive alternatives around, but I bought this one because of the convenience and my belief that Amazon won't have something too shoddy. The wobbly attachment was a disappointment.
B000JIJPZY|1.0|Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
B005NSPWH0|5.0|I usually read reviews, not write them. I had the cd, just received the new double deluxe CD edition a few weeks ago (which I highly endorse), but this blew me away. The sound is fantastic. So clean there isn't even a faint sound of vinyl noise. Every record pressed should sound like this. The only negative is that I didn't receive one of the 100 autographed photos.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|the actual vinyl record of this recording is made of translucent red vinyl.  VERY VERY COOL.  and the songs are a nice alternative to standard x-mas songs.
0062011847|3.0|Something was off about this book in the opening scene...the Patrician getting upset to the point of exclamation about a crossword puzzle?  I think not.  Once past this part, the story is decent enough, funny in places, dark in others, an acceptable Vimes story.  But the actual construction of the book itself...this was a terrible job.  Poor binding, text not aligned to the page squarely, the sawtooth page edges...does not feel like a book that will last.
0071762345|5.0|Rarely does a book turn my head around like this one does. Everything you need to do social media right is in this book.  The author has the victories to prove his key points.  There are lots of examples, which is impressive considering that Facebook and Twitter haven't been around that long.  The only con is that the key points get repeated a bit too much.  Yes, we get it .... be transparent, don't push sales, be responsive, provide value to your community, be patient, build your brand.  Not a big deal considering the value of his insights.  It would be interesting in his next book to learn if any of his larger clients have done any exacting ROI analysis that incorporate all the marginal costs.  It might be difficult to put numbers on some things, but I am sure a few of his clients have attempted it.  I am buying an extra copy to give to a CEO who needs to get with it.
0525423842|1.0|I am 40 years old, and am a huge fan of \\"juvenile\\" fiction. There are tons of great books written about kids and aimed at kids that adults can really enjoy. Probably the most popular is Harry Potter. I tend to enjoy these books as they have less violence and \\"evilness\\" in them than many adult books.<br /><br />I have read many John Grisham books before and find he is an excellent author. So when I saw this book, I figured it would be outstanding. Boy was I wrong!! Pretty much from the first chapter, I felt the writing and the overall \\"flow\\" of the book was questionable. I have read hundreds of juvenile fiction books, and can pretty quickly determine if the author is good, or not so good from the first chapter. This really surprised me, as I know John Grishams' adult fiction books are amazing. I actually had to recheck the front cover to see if I was mistaken that he was actually the author.<br /><br />The many other negative reviews here at Amazon pretty much cover the problems with this book. One issue though that I have not seen mentioned is with the illegal alien. As a lawyer wannabe, Theo should have reported the illegal. He is ILLEGAL. As in NOT LEGAL. As in, anyone interested in and presumably supportive of the LAW, should see this as a violation of the law. I know that's pretty hard for a young teen, so why even have that scenario in the book?!? There was no questioning on Theo's part whether he should even think about turning in the illegal. He could at least have thought about it. But there was no hesitation whatsoever that Theo would do all he could to keep the ILLEGAL ALIEN from being arrested and deported. Pretty sad, Mr. Grisham, pretty sad. If we can't trust the law, and the people who work in law to uphold THE LAW, who can we trust?<br /><br />Overall, a very poorly written book, and a horrible ending. There are so many \\"unknown\\" authors that are much, much better at writing juvenile fiction, that this seems shady, to try and sell to the juvenile readers a shoddy book, assuming your NAME will do most of the selling for you. And to have the guts to write a second book in this series after the poor reviews from readers just shows Mr Grisham doesn't give a @#$& about quality work, just about making a buck. Let the real quality authors of juvenile fiction alone, and keep your pathetic excuse for a book out of their competition.<br /><br />Lastly, it is sickening to see the \\"reviews\\" from newspapers pander to Grisham. On his website, or the back of the book, you will see glowing reviews about how utterly fantastic and genius this book is. BULLC$#P!! I think any adult (especially a paid reviewer), would be able to tell right away that this book is under par. But, because it's the GREAT JOHN GRISHAM (ooohhhh), we'll give it 5 stars. Ridiculous!!! Just google reviews for this book and you will see what the reading public thinks of this book. Many, many agree with me.<br /><br />It's pretty unusual for such an acclaimed author as Mr Grisham to have so many negative reviews here on Amazon, so don't just take my word for it. This really is a poor book. Shame on you, Grisham.our NAME will do most of the selling for you.

158234082X|4.0|Tony Bourdain seems like an upright guy to me. I know I'm eleven years late getting this review up, but maybe that gives me a little more perspective. In an age in which civilization seems regularly threatened by terrorist plots and corporate debacles, his sins seem venial. Nowhere is his moral compass more evident than in the penultimate chapter, entitled \\"So You Want To Be A Chef? A Commencement Address.\\" Commandment #3 \\"Don't Steal\\" is the longest section, and perhaps the most valuable in highlighting the importance of personal integrity. Sure, the book is raunchy, not the sort of thing you'd recommend to the church ladies' book circle. Still, Chef Tony won me over with his passion for excellent food, his humble admission of personal limitations, and his use of self-deprecating humor. All the rock-and-roll and sharp knives helped, too.
0553801473|1.0|Not much happens in this book.  The one before it I probably read 200 pages as I skimmed through, for this one it was probably closer to 50.  There just wasn't anything worth stopping for as I skipped around in this empy ghost-town of a book.<br /><br />On a more constructive note: The Name of the Wind, and The Wise Man's Fear are still great books you might enjoy instead.
B005JLN9Z8|4.0|The first cd is better but this one definately rocks. The guitar playing is the best part about this band Satchel is amazing. The songs overall arent as strong as Feel's were but half of em are great.  Stand outs are Just Like Tiger Woods- It Wont Suck Itself- Tomorrow night- Thats What Girls Are For- and Weenie Ride theres 2 more that are ok and the other 3 or so are not very good. Some funny stuff on here with great musicianship. Buy it knowing only half is great.
B005EYP8PO|3.0|I love U2. The 2nd disc of B-sides and rarities in this Deluxe Edition is worthwhile and probably what you expected. The packaging for this Deluxe Edition however, is definitely not! I expected the higher quality hardcover slipcase package like the other U2 anniversary editions (Boy, War, etc.), instead what you get is the soft-cover packaging like the worthless Deluxe Edition of their last release,  No Line on the Horizon. I envisioned having all the U2 albums lined up on my CD shelf in those nice hard slipcover editions. Would have looked awesome! Sorry to say, that doesn't look like it is ever going to happen. I appreciate the previously unreleased material, it's a must have for any U2 fan, but why change the style of the packaging?
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Do you enjoy repeatedly banging your head against solid brick walls? Do you get your jollies off by plunging a copper wire into your genitals while watching videos of prostitutes getting their teeth pulled out? Does your sense of morality come from in depth studies of the Marquis De Sade and Viking Speed Metal? Do you hate puppies? If so, then this is the album for you.  This album is the daring bridge between avant-garde punk and thrash metal that no one has been waiting for, or wanted. No other album that I've encountered has had such an incredible ability to induce feelings of physical discomfort and alienation. It calls out to you and tells you with utmost clarity that life is not worth living, that rock 'n roll is a festering rotten corpse with no hope of redemption, and that everything you love is meaningless. So, kudos to LouLou and Metallica for that.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|Very simply a boring movie.  Some explosions but no real special effects worth noting.  Boring plot, couldn't wait for it to end.  Only thing decent was the eye candy.  Don't waste your time.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This is seriously the absolute worst thing Metallica has ever put their name on.  I've been a Metallica fan since I was 9 years old, I'm 31 now.  I thought St. Anger was bad, but this album now makes St. Anger seem like gold and that's hard to do.  Why did Metallica shoot themselves in the foot right after they had a decent album with \\"Death Magnetic\\"?  All I can figure is Metallica has a bunch of \\"yes men\\" surrounding them and are afraid to tell them when something sucks.  Although a normal person shouldn't need someone to tell them that this album sucks.  If I was Metallica I would have NEVER put this out.<br /><br />And now on to Lou flippin Reed.  Oh My,  don't get me wrong Lou Reed had his day, but the guy is old, apparently a weird perv, and totally tone deaf now.  He sounds like the Grandpa from the Simpsons talking over music that he has no idea is playing in the background.<br /><br />Some good news for Metallica though.<br />They have finally came up with a way to get people to stop downloading there music....Make absolute crap.  Not only will I not buy this album, I will not waste the ridiculously small amount of memory it would take to save this album on my hard drive.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this album one star is because their was not an option for zero stars.<br /><br />Shame on you Metallica for putting crap out and expecting fans to buy it,....
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|Wow. This is one intense show. At first, it felt like I was watching the storyline of a zombie video game, but starting about halfway through Season 1, it has become something more. The characters are in constant danger, and not everyone is going to make it through alive. some of the scenes are difficult to watch for their brutality, but that's  part of what is so great about The Walking Dead. They don't gloss everything over. As you would expect life to be post-zombie apocalypse, there is more tragedy than happy ending, but that just serves to make the viewer more involved and hoping for the others to stay alive and keep fighting.
B004G25V9S|3.0|I've listened to this several times and was lucky to get this right before they played live here. I've seen Opeth twice now and after listening to this cd I have a greater appreciation for their new direction. After all said and done it is nothing like they have done. My favorite album still is Watershed out of all 10 albums. I liked the heavy and mellow songs. It's diverse to say the least.<br />My main gripe on this album is some of the songs seems like they are just \\"jamming\\" and nearly recording as they go along as if there really is no song structures and instead of like most bands play the song and record the drums first they all just recorded parts they wanted and chopped it up on a computer program.<br />After seeing some of these songs live I love \\"I feel the dark\\" the most which really made me listen to the album again. There is a Youtube video of mikael akerfeldt and now I'm wondering in the future if Opeth will ever go anywhere near the styles of the past. It wasn't a coincidence he did play some heavy songs from other albums but avoided any of the vocal oriented songs that involved screaming/death style. Hopefully not a vision to come.
031603438X|5.0|Just when you're sitting there in your chair thinking you know who Keith Richards is and being all judgemental, pick up this book and find out how right and wrong you are.  Yep, he played hard, but he's also an authentic voice in the darkness of how music was made in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and now.  Not only that, he surprised me with how gentle a human being and sober/aware a man he is.  He's the non-violent ragged person you always throw money at on the corner who has nothing.  If Keith Richards wasn't a brilliant artist, he'd be a homeless bum out to hurt no one.  I, for one, was riveted by this bio from page one to the end and have more respect for Keith as an artist than I ever imagined.  Read it.  Appreciate it and be damn glad the dude is still alive.  I sure am.  Buy the dam# book.

Other books describe either special parts and practices or introduce the language with gaps or not so deeply.<br />After this book you'll never ask questions like what is the closure, prototyping, how to use Ajax, or where is the place of jQuery in JavaScript programming.<br />This is one of the two best books you can find to deeply understand and come to love JavaScript.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Too bad I didn't read all these one star reviews before buying Sunshine. They are right on for why this movie is a dud. I came away scratching my head because it had everything needed to be great. Excellent special effects, a beautiful space craft, a decent storyline and some good actors. Yet it all ends up as garbage.   What it lacks is creativity. It never draws you into the story. In fact as someone else stated it's difficult to follow along. One scene after another is stolen from other movies. It tries to be everything and fails at everything. All the actors come off as supporting cast. No one takes the lead. Well in the end one actor gets the job by default.  Throw in a bit of blood and guts and this comes off as a cheap horror flick. And as another reviewer points out it isn't even good at that.

0312427999|5.0|I've read dozens (hundreds?) of books about what went wrong during the Bush administration (as well as books about what's continued to go wrong under Obama too).  Some books are about specific things such as the Iraq war or GITMO.  Others look at more overarching themes such as executive power or disregard for the rule of law.  Most of such books have made some important points and contributed some valuable analysis, but I've usually been left feeling like the blind men arguing over what they've discovered.  \\"It's a rope,\\" says one.  \\"No, it's a wall,\\" says another.  \\"You're both wrong, claims the third, \\"it's a tree trunk.\\"<br /><br />Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is the first book that correctly identifies the elephant.  Now, perhaps Ms. Klein doesn't have the elephant quite right - maybe her elephant's ears are a tad too large, or perhaps its tail is a bit too short, but overall, she has described the elephant remarkably well.<br /><br />Following an introduction, Klein opens with the story of Dr. Ewen Cameron, a psychiatrist who believed that in order to \\"heal\\" his patients, he first needed to destroy their dysfunctional personality structure and \\"regress\\" them back to infancy in order to create a \\"clean slate\\" upon which to build a new, healthy personality.  To accomplish this, he used a barrage of \\"treatments\\" from psychoactive drugs to extreme doses of electroshock therapy to sensory deprivation for weeks or even months at a time.  The only problem, of course, is that he never successfully re-created fresh, healthy people - all he did was traumatize people and leave their old selves virtually destroyed.<br /><br />Now, it may seem a bit of a leap from one obscure Canadian psychiatrist to the global wave of \\"shock and awe\\" which has escalated especially in the last decade, but Ms. Klein has followed the trail carefully and plausibly.  One of the first and most important stops along this trail is the economist Milton Friedman, the godfather of the \\"Chicago School\\" system of supply-sided free market capitalism.<br /><br />Friedman and his followers believe that if only there were purely unregulated, completely free markets, all or nearly all world problems would correct themselves through market \\"signals\\".  Friedmanites believe that most if not all problems result from government regulations which distort the markets and confuse the signals.  Their problem, especially during the height of New Deal Keynesian economics, was that no purely free market existed anywhere.  In language eerily reminiscent of Ewen Cameron, Friedman wished to create a \\"clean slate\\" upon which \\"healthy\\" capitalism could be built.<br /><br />The next problem, however, was the pure capitalism was (and remains) deeply unpopular and, hence, difficult to implement in a democratic state.  It turns out, fancy that, that given the choice, people *want* their government to protect them from rapacious corporate interests.  The \\"Southern Cone\\" region of South America exemplified this problem.  Having recently broken away from European colonial powers, nations like Chile and Argentina began building \\"developmentalist\\" economies - basically capitalistic economies protected by government regulations.  Furthermore, these developmentalist economies were by and large successful.  And wildly popular.<br /><br />The Friedmanites initially tried to overcome developmentalism (note, despite the rhetoric, the concern was never about communism) by sending hundreds of Chile's brightest students to study economics at the University of Chicago.  These \\"Chicago Boys\\" were to return home and implement their newfound knowledge.  But they weren't taken very seriously back home, since developmentalism was still in full-swing.<br /><br />Their chance came with the brutal and bloody overthrow of the democratically elected Salvador Allende by the U.S. backed Augusto Pinochet.  In correspondence with Pinochet, Friedman urged Pinochet to use the window of opportunity created by theshock of the violent overthrow to implement \\"shock therapy\\".  While the country was still reeling, and while dissidents were being actively and publicly silenced, Pinochet opened up nationalized companies to foreign private investors at fire sale prices.  He repealed trade restrictions which resulted in a flood of cheap foreign goods which put many local companies out of business.  In the name of \\"austerity\\" and reducing debt, he cut back on social programs for the poor and very young and old.  Most Chileans were too busy trying to survive and put their lives back together to protest.  Those who did tended to mysteriously disappear or simply get executed on the spot.<br /><br />Of course, even with the markets thrown wide open, the markets did not correct the ills of the country.  In fact, things got significantly worse until some of the worst of the abuses were halted and some basic regulations restored.  Meanwhile, over half of Chile's population descended into poverty and destitution.<br /><br />In country after country, Klein details how the same basic patterns repeated over and over again, with variations to account for the learning curve of the Chicago Bys and the different initial circumstances of each country.  Indonesia, Argentina, Uruguay, Poland, Russia, South Africa, China and Iraq all experienced variations of \\"disaster capitalism\\" following (or during) wars, coups or revolutions, often in direct opposition to what the revolutionaries were fighting for.  Time after time, nationalized industries were ripped from the people and pillaged by foreigners while governments cut back on aid to their own people.  Time after time free market capitalism was implemented by brute force and shock therapy because it could not be implemented by democratic vote.<br /><br />Even the \\"developed\\" nations were not immune to the assault by the Chicago Boys.  Both Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the U.S. were ardent admirers of Milton Friedman, but both knew that they couldn't get away with what Pinochet and Suharto had.  But both found their openings to begin making lasting changes - Thatcher used the Falkland's war while Reagan used the air traffic controllers strike, among others.<br /><br />Klein also shows how disaster capitalism gets implemented after natural disasters.  Fishing families swept from their villages by the 2004 tsunami returned to find their beaches closed to them but wide open for luxury hotels and tourist resorts.  Refugees from 2006 Hurricane Katrina returned to find no effort to rebuild their public schools, but charter schools already infested the city.<br /><br />Klein's book is a searing indictment of Milton Friedman and his followers, their morally bankrupt economic philosophy and the wide spread pain and suffering they have caused.  This book is a must-read for anyone who wonders how we got where we are now.  How it is that in the richest nation on earth, upwards of 10% of the population is unemployed, more than one in four children is food insecure and 49 million American don't have basic health coverage, while the top 1% own fleets of cars and boats and even entire islands.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the book is that it was published in 2007 - just before the Great Recession.  I hope that Klein comes out with a follow up soon.  In her final chapter, \\"Shock wears off\\", Klein talks about a number of hopeful signs, many coming from the first countries to be shocked and awed.  It is her belief that as shock wears off, people become shock resistant and once more able to fight back.  Perhaps that's what we're seeing with the Occupy movement.<br /><br />This far-reaching, wide-ranging and hard-hitting tour de force is also extensively documented in 100+ pages of end notes plus several asterisked footnotes.  This book should be required reading for every high school and college economics class, if not for every American.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

B005AUWY90|5.0|Even though I had to pay for shipping, it was still the cheapest way to go, by a whopping $0.02!  But, since they (Amazon) gave a $5.00 credit towards using their Movie Streaming Service (which I use about twice per month), it was a better value, basically, because you get to see 2 movies (Cars 2 Blu-Ray, and another on streaming) for the price.  I'm cheap, I shopped around, and this was the best value.  If you use their (Amazon's) streaming service, do it!  Oh, and a great movie, though may be scary for kids (death in a Disney Cars movie?!??!).  I'm a fan of Lewis Hamilton - I can't believe his character in the movie has gapped teeth too!!!! LOL!

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I'm not here to give you an in depth review, cause well, it would suck. But I am here to tell you that if you loved Megadeth's last album 'Endgame' or any of the their 90's successes like 'Rust In Peace', 'Countdown To Extinction', or 'Youthanasia', then please do yourself a favor and pick up 'TH1RT3EN'. As the title of my review says, this album is just flat out brutal thrash metal. The producer Johnny K really brought back the feel of the three 90's albums I mentioned earlier.   Go ahead and listen to some of the album on YouTube and then go buy yourself a copy, you DEFINITELY won't be disappointed. Because at the end of the day, Megadeth is the world's state-of-the-art thrash metal band!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I saw this film last night. Before I get to my review I want to address the editorial review on this page, which said that there wasn't a link from the period this story takes place to the future when Captain America is part, or leader, of the Avengers. That reviewer evidently did not see the very first and very last scenes in the film, which explain the process by which Captain America is frozen, then thawed in the future.<br /><br />Anyway (sorry for the spoiler but I had to get that out the way because I don't think it was fair of the reviewer to overlook these scenes), I confess that it's been a very long time since I had such a good time on a superhero film. The reason I enjoyed this film is because, for one of the rare times with these types of films, its human elements didn't take a back seat to the special effects. In fact, it was the other way around. The acting was very good as was the story, as believable as a story so preposterous as its presented, can be.<br /><br />Basically, the story takes place during WW2 and a rogue general in one of Hitler's divisions called Hydra has acquired an ancient energy source that has enabled him to construct the ultimate weapon. The only hope for the Western axis is to develop \\"super soldiers\\" starting with a short pencil-neck recruit named Steve Rogers who volunteers to be a guinea pig that will amplify both his physical and also his moral attributes.<br /><br />This is one very good film, far and away the fourth best superhero this decade behind Batman Begins, the Dark Knight, and Spider Man. They really took time getting into character development, it wasn't just Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am straight to the action, but there was a real story here and not just enough to justify special effects later on. I really appreciate the film's attempt to recreate that era, to make the film feel alien enough for me to believe that it happened in another time. As usual, both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific, Weaving as the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee as the hard-bitten military guy. Like I said, this film is more story than action even though the action and cgi effects are very good in this film, and always feel appropriate for the situations in which they are used. I like the sepia look of the human parts of the movie and how this look contrasts with the scenes showing Captain America doing his thing. This is a great primer for next year's Avengers film and I hope that the creative team who put together Captain plays a part in that film. Must see.as the hard-bitten military guy.

0439023521|5.0|I am a woman in my mid-30s and first heard about THG books about 3 years ago.  Yes, this book is categorized as a teen book, but to my surprise, I found myself really getting in to the story line.  I couldn't put the book down because the story was so suspenseful and engaging throughout.  Collins has a wonderful knack of giving you just enough to want so much more.  This haunting book has suspense, action, romance, and is wonderfully envisioned from beginning to end.  The main characters are complex, but you get a good sense of each person through their thoughts, actions, and interactions with one another.  There is quite a bit of violence in the book and I'm not sure that it is something I would want even young teens to be exposed to, but the edge-of-your-seat storyline trumped my general dislike for violence within the book.  I would recommend this book to young adults and up.  This is a book I will keep as part of my library to be reread over and over through the years and lend to friends and family.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Before The Fast and The Furious, Speed Racer, and all of today's hybrid human/cgi rendered cars and blue screen chase sequences, there were films with real cars, real stuntmen, and Detroit gas guzzlers with Holly carburetors that made a lot of noise. Of these films, Mad Max and its follow-up, The Road Warrior, exemplifies the extinct breed known as muscle cars, or, in this instance, Australian muscle, mate!<br /><br />As a kid growing up, there was always something about the look of this film that turned me off: the desert, the dust, the solitary road, the mohawked freaks, the little ugly wild boy. But when I got older and a little more open minded, especially during a period when I became obsessed with car movies, I decided to give Mad Max, the so-called \\"classic,\\" a test drive and all I can say is WOW!!! There's something about the post apocalyptic setting of this film that makes those big muscular 70's cars look right at home, almost mythical. If you like the type of medieval hot rods that are primered, stripped down to the bone essentials--motors, tires, steering wheels, gear-shifters--then this is your kind of film.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Mad Max concerns a good cop (Gibson), member of the MFP (Main Force Police  who surrenders to the dark side of his soul following a tragic incident. And if I add more to this I'll spoil the fun for those who haven't seen it. Can't say enough about this baby. Action, scary, prophetic, poignant, and beautiful can't begin to describe this film experience. When you see this film, it's easy to see how it launched Mr. Gibson into super-stardom.
B000002NFM|5.0|Fat of the Land is the best album from eletronic music of all time. Perhaps, it´s more than a eletronic music album because Prodigy got a real punk metal style. Smack my bitch up, Breathe, Firestarter, Diesel Power and Mindfields are a wonderful mix of metal, punk, atmospheric music and eletronica together. Prodigy hit the world with Fat of the Land.

This book is such a good read that I couldn't stop reading it (my apologies to my family for hiding out and ditching my responsibilities for a while)! I am in awe of the talent of E.L.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Wow, wow and more wow. What a book! I had no idea what I was in for when I picked up this book. I didn't read any of the reviews or even the book description. I started reading it on a recommendation and at first I thought \\"what the hell am I reading?\\" I generally don't read books that involve BDSM, but I was hooked from the first page and couldn't put it down. The relationship between the main characters Christian and Ana (or shall I say, Miss Steele and Mr. Grey) is intense, complex and smokin' hot! I LOVED the emails between the characters they were very witty. I am so glad this book was recommended to me, I absolutely loved it. Now I am on to the sequel \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\"<br /><br />I have read several reviews that mention that the book is written by a British author and the book is set in Seattle. Yes, both are true and yes there are a few moments in the book that you do notice if you are from the States. However, with that being said, it does NOT change my opinion of the the awesomeness of the book (and yes I said awesomeness). I am sure if I tried writing a book set in England I would have a few minor issues as well with slang and terminology. I don't think that it detracts from the book as all, but I had to put my two cents in.
B003VPWXRO|1.0|Terrible, boring, repetitive, nearly unreadable. This lifeless book is basically de Rossi endlessly flogging herself as she recounts her early career ('I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm fat, I'm ugly, repeat, repeat, repeat'). She aims for a self-effacing tone and a truthful inner voice and fails miserably. I barely made it to the end.

B0040QYROK|5.0|It is generally accepted that the movies' science fiction genre was born with Fritz Lang's monumental, 1927 vision of the future, METROPOLIS. Today, 84 years later, there is no reason to dispute that claim. Lang's fantastic film, so innovative in story and imagery, is still a stunning achievement to see.  Kino's magnificent, fully restored Blu-ray edition is the way to go, unquestionably. Over 25 minutes of missing footage has been inserted so that the film now virtually \\"re-invents\\" our perception of what it is. The music score is the original 1927 composition by Gottfried Huppertz and it is outstanding.  The extras include a 50 minute documentary that covers the genesis of the film, its influence on cinema, and the efforts made over the years to get it to its current, restored state.  After all these years, what a movie.  NOTE: METROPOLIS is great enough to own twice, and I highly recommend Giorgio Moroder's 1984 color tinted with sound effects version featuring music by Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy, Jon Anderson, Billy Squire and Adam Ant. Also available from Kino, it's mastered off a 35mm archival print that looks terrific in 1080p. Thanks to the Morodor version, many people - myself included - were first turned on to this cinematic masterpiece.
B005WFUZTE|4.0|This is a great album if you are a guitar player - heavy emphasis on the guitar playing. Some really great riffs and solos. However, I am a bass player, and while I was excited to see Jr. back, I am bored to death by the rhythm section. Especially the drumming - Drover seems to mail in his performance - he's repetitive and boring, no flash, no fills, and certainly no thrills. I've never been a fan of his, and he didn't do anything to change my perception of him here. His most interesting beats are actually on New World Order - which just happens to give writing credit to Nick Menza - so they are not his. And Jr., he just goes along with the rhythm guitar for the most part.<br /><br />Album wise - there is stuff on here that is reminiscent of Rust, Symphony, and Youth - as half the songs are unfinished ideas from this time period.<br /><br />I'd rate this higher if it weren't for a boring, repetitive drummer.
0385534639|2.0|This book is beautifully written.  The story is well constructed -- but only to a point.  I do not believe anything romantic is accurring with Marco and Celia.  I have no idea why Bailey is chosen.  The build-up for these three characters is just flat and boring.  The rest of the characters are well-rounded and well described.  It is a shame that more time was not spent on the supposedly main characters.

A Serbian film I swore I would never see it but I always hear that you can't judge a film if you've seen it. This movie is filth. I gave it a minus 9 & a half cause giving it a 1 out of 10 would give it too much credit. It really gets me that this gets praised & called art & a masterpiece. This is a MEGA RANT. Srdjan Spasojevic you should be ashamed of yourself. This Srjan Toaderovic you're a POS but you start off with this boy watching a por no cause his daddy stared in it. When the parents come in no punishment the mom's like lets go make toast. YEAH CAUSE ALL TOASTERS TOAST. Just like I want to toast every copy of this movie. This guy misses the old life of being a p o r n star. Really REALLY!? You have a beautiful wife you can do it anytime. He signs a contract which he doesn't read. You have politics injected. I'm like oh please spare me. He's  given an ear piece & told what to do. Oh just what I want to see this guy is shown a video of new born r a p e. The guy in the video looks like 1 of The Harris Brothers. He is drugged on something & he finds tapes he was forced to r a p e a woman the guy giving the instructions sounds like Stewie from FG it would be funny but my mouth was gaped wide open in this scene he's beating her & cuts her head off. Then the grim finale where he's taken to this room & has to do these bodies & this guy with a mask turns out to be the brother. The sheet is pulled over & the guy is doing his own kid. A fight breaks out our hero kills the director & 1 half of the Harris Brothers with his d ! ç æ k. The family commits suicide & again my mouth was gaped wide open through all of this this director guy comes in & tells this guy start with the little 1. I saw it & I can say it is the worst movie I ever saw the worst movie every year imo. This is not art it's not a masterpiece it's filth. This gets the pass yet Stallone does an old school action movies & he gets s h it on. Oh but this is realistic. Movies were made to escape reality for entertainment. Uwe Boll couldn't make something this atrocious. So that's my rant on North 2 cause this is the darker realistic sequel.
6305841861|4.0|Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick sequel and perhaps one of my favorite horror films.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie Evil Dead. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is the perfect mesh of On the edge of your seat horror, and side hurting laughter induced comedy.<br /><br />Sam Raimi is a second to none with a camera and has gone on to create some of the best films and television shows around.  The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or 'splatstick' as Campbell calls it.<br /><br />Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination. If you don't like it, \\"I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul.\\"

0525423656|3.0|At the end of Matched, Cassie has discovered that her match with Ky was planned, but does not know by whom.  They were purposely put together and watched.  Her actions were all predicted ahead of time, and she has fulfilled all that they predicted she would do, including placing Ky in the category for advancement. They knew she was aware that he was smarter than he let on and that human emotions played a part in her decision.  We also saw that Xander was not all we had thought, in that he had been jealous of Ky for a while, but would do anything for the love of his life, Cassie.  When Cassie told him about Ky's picture on her card, he stated the obvious, \\"I was there too, Cassie. You only chose to see him\\".  Xander is definitely more than he appears, and just like I wanted Cat to choose Gale in the Hunger Games, I want Cassie to choose Xander.<br /><br />In Crossed, Cassie has been relocating for months trying to get to the Outer Realms to find Ky.  Xander makes a brief appearance at her camp one day (Pick him! Pick him! Pick him!), just before she escapes on an airlift where she is sent to a camp in the Outer Realms where Cassie is determined to find Ky.<br /><br />Like all dystopias, this one has a message about what happens when a society gives up some freedoms to another group that promises safety.  The book makes a good argument that personal freedom of choice is to be preferred over promised safety, and that is why the Rebels give up safety to fight for freedom.<br /><br />More secrets are revealed about Xander,the Society, Ky's reasons for not wanting to join the Rebels and Cassie's split desires.<br /><br />Crossed is very compelling and well written but suffers from middle book lack of action.  The characters are definitely more developed, but nothing really happens.  I, personally hope to see more Xander in book 3.<br /><br />Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (ARC)<br />Would I read it again? Yes<br />Would I recommend it to friends? Yes
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Hi All,<br />  I had a Scoche passPORT unit before that worked fine with my iPod Touch 4G in my Scion TC 2008 (premium pioneer OLED factory radio).  Tried to just place my new iPhone 4S into the old adapter and I found that all audio coming out of the iPhone had a loud, high-pitch squeal.  Using the reviews on this CableJive charge adapter I made the jump (purchase).  No more noise (as far as I can hear) from the system now!  So I replaced the Scoche with this and my iPhone 4S is happy and I'm happy!  Buy this one if you've got an old Scion and are using the stereo integration...it works!
1844487172|5.0|Have you ever looked at silk or paper flowers and wondered to yourself 'how did they do that'?  If so, this is the book you need to have in your collection as it answers that question and many more.  I make millinery flowers for civil war era hats and finally got tired of purchasing paper and silk florals from suppliers, and thought that I will just make them myself.  Well, this book will certainly make that possible as it shows with great detail every aspect of creating the most fragile and beautiful flowers petals you can imagine.  Now the best part of it all is that it is so very simple!  With some time and very basic tools that you probably already have in your house, you can create silk or paper flowers that look as if they have survived the ravages of time in perfect condition!  The ability to create vintage quality florals yourself will only serve to inspire you further - from a single flower to a full boquet - one will not be enough I guarantee it! If you only purchase one book this year, make it this one, you will not be disappointed.
B000002GY9|5.0|God forbid I should ever end up on a desert island with just 10 cds... but if I do, I want to make sure this is one of the cds I have with me! Not a bad song on here. Each is a miniature movie set to music, down and dirty dive-bar blues.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Wesley Willis has better incoherent ramblings than Lou Reed on this epic fail. What an atrocity to try to listen to all the way through without wanting to stab your ears with a pencil! I consider myself to be eclectic and like weird and artsy music as well as loving metal, but this is just self indulgent, pretentious crap that sounds like it was written by a 5th grader who is just coming into puberty while also reading about Jack the Ripper. It's just horrible in every sense. Metallica's contribution to this music is almost worse. They add heaviness and more drone sounds to the off key, geriatric Reed who rambles and spits out one of the poorest excuses of 'poetry' ever penned by a shaking, drug addled loser who was once an icon. One of his lyrics say 'I don't have the strength I once had,' and that is the understatement of the century. Another lyric 'I want so much to hurt you, I want so much to hurt you.' That should be the mantra that both camps of Reed and Metallica should be saying to each other after recording this piece of artsy fartsy garbage. Worst album of 2011, and I would almost go as far as saying this is the worst album of the decade.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|I got the discs shipped pretty fast but the inner flap was broken. It is basically what I ordered and no big deal, I can watch the movies fine. I wish it was 100% though, it's gonna be annoying when handling disc 1

0439023521|5.0|I have read a lot of books, but this has to be one of the best books I've ever read.  I starting reading the book and I just couldn't stop.  If anyone is wondering whether to get this book or not it is a definite yes!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Yeah, I took a chance, av said Malicious.  Worked fine at first, I've. Had this about a week.  Downloaded a few videos, fine.  This app is malicous in that during downloads your phone/tablet is vulnerable to getting hacked.  And when apps mention re-writing data on your sd card that should give anyone pause.    Today I go to play music-I did not download any mp3 music files with this program, mind you-talking about Amazon mp3 files-they're gone.  I backed up most of my files to my laptop, but not a few recent purchases.  So if this program messed with that, what next??  I will uninstall this.    Will try to recover those files or look for a good recovery program.  For the reviewers who nay-say av software, if you have this app its just a matter of time.  Beware.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|Folks, I stopped by the record store first thing this morning and have already played it twice, in the car on my way to work and again on my computer as I fulfill my appointed tasks.  Now if you have not been prepared for this through Brian Wilson's 2004 remake, here's your fair warning-this is not like ANY album you've ever heard before. Upon your first listen, you may not make it all the way through and dismiss this as incoherent, drug fueled mumbo-jumbo.  Then if you're patient and give it a few more spins, it starts to make sense.  Essentially, this is about as American as the Beatles Sgt. Pepper is British, each album dealing with the folklore, culture, and music of their repective countries as a major theme (in the Beatles' case, the British music hall tradition).  The lovely \\"Our Prayer\\" begins as a sort of a gregorian chant mixed with doo-wop, as it segues into \\"Gee,\\" an obscure 1954 hit by The Crows. \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" which sounds rather stange at first, is a tale from the Old West. \\"Do You Like Worms\\" (aka Roll Plymouth Rock) deals with the American Indian's loss of the west with a bit of mock-Hawaiian chanting thrown in (which is one of my favorite parts of this album). \\"Cabin Essence\\" deals with the advent of trains on the old west, etc.   For fans of the Brian Wilson 2003 version, you will notice subtle differences here and there with lyrics and phrasing. I personally like this album's version of \\"Our Prayer,\\" \\"Surf's Up,\\" and \\"Wonderful\\" while I prefer the later version of \\"Roll Plymouth Rock\\" (the 1966-67 version here \\"Do You Like Worms\\" is a less coherent fragment). The real Beach Boys' voices make some difference over Brian's later band. Additionally, while the 2004 version contains alternative lyrics to \\"Good Vibrations,\\" this album contains the more familiar version. There are also two very interesting alternative tracks entitled \\"You're Welcome\\" (which is a nice little greeting tune) and the offbeat \\"He Gives Speeches.\\" If you have both versions, I would keep both of them.  As mentioned earlier, this is an acquired taste that the listener would have to \\"get\\" through repeated playing. But once you give it a fair chance and have an adventurous spirit, you should enjoy it. Would it have been a hit in 1967? NO WAY! It would have been too avant-garde for the average music fan of the time, and the single \\"Heroes and Villains\\" as well as the substitute \\"Smiley Smile\\" album did not do well on the charts that year.  This is not the kind of thing you would play at a house party or casual gathering of friends, but some would find it enjoyable in its own way aside from the historical value. However, I would warn the casual Smile fan to stick with the album or 2 CD edition, as the box set (which is also available in record stores) is just overkill.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love it. The graphics are nice on my Galaxy S II and it's really addictive and fun. Great game.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Excellent movie.  Even if you are not a devout kung fu fan you will enjoy this movie.  Superb acting by main character.  Good soundtrack.  You will be very pleased with this selection.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Steel Panther ROCK!!! This album is awesome... I can't wait to crank this at full volume. \\"FEEL the STEEL\\" baby! Wooo!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This album is awful. A for \\"effort,\\" I guess... F- for the final product. It's almost laughable, if it weren't so sad.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Once again, Megadeth deliver a killer album. Long ago they stole the Metal crown from Metallica. Thanks, Dave, for the music! :)
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I didn't want to listen to this cause I knew it wasn't gonna work. It's painful to watch a band that we love stumble. We all admire Metallica and try & support their \\"artistic freedom\\" but Lou's \\"voice\\" doesn't even fit with the music that Metallica is playing. I can usually make it through the disc(s) but had to fast forward through every song to get to the end!?! The only listenable songs are \\"Iced Honey\\" & \\"Dragon\\" and honestly, they suck too :). You are either gonna give it a shot or not but I recommend you don't!!!
0670022411|5.0|If you have not yet read A Discovery of Witches, you are missing an incredible treat. Complex, but not confusing, with wonderful characters and an excellent story line, the book caught me in the first few lines. The first of a trilogy, this is a \\"must own\\" book.  I read a library edition, and promptly purchased a copy to own, as well as one to lend. I have actually read it three times, and found new details and delights each time.  The author is an historian and professor, and that is evident in the depth of details and the quality of the writing.  She is also a storyteller, and that is evident from the first page.  This is a purchase you should not resist. A Discovery of Witches is truly an amazing discovery.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|MASTERPIECE!  MIGHT BE THE BEST DISNEY MOVIE EVER...AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME.  THE ADVANCED FORMAT IS INCREDIBLE! IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE THE FIRST 20 TIMES YOU'LL LOVE IT NOW.  GOT TO BUY AND WATCH TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  GREAT VIEW IN 3D
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book highlights a phenomenon at the root of the persistent unemployment problem in this country.  My opinion has always been that the root cause was the \\"great equalization\\" of global wages brought about by globalization (although it was masked for a few years by the real estate bubble).  But this book made me acknowledge the unwitting role that technology has played by accelerating productivity gains to a rate at which the economy cannot absorb the excess labor.   It's a fascinating and concise read.  Highly recommend it.
B005CW5E3E|3.0|This could be anyone's record by the sound of it.  There is no signature Johnny Winter sound in the playing or the singing.  This reminds me of all those Blues Bureau cd's where a bunch of different artists do one song each as leader on a themed or tribute record like to Hound Dog Taylor or Freddie King.  Production values are high and sonics  are good but I would have given this disc a pass had I heard it first.  If you like AND LIVE, 2ND WINTER, STILL ALIVE AND WELL or Johnny's stuff on Alligator, I don't think you will like this recording.
B0035WTE2U|3.0|An odd compilation, to be sure.  Bona fide hits like \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"T.N.T.\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and \\"Highway To Hell\\" share space with fan favorites like \\"Rock N' Roll Damnation\\", \\"If You Want Blood\\", and \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\". Beyond that, it's head-scratchers like \\"Evil Walks\\" and  \\"The Razors Edge\\". Songs like the aforementioned \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"War Machine\\" and the under-rated \\"Guns For Hire\\" seem to have been picked because their themes tie in directly with the movie, but then that mentality doesn't explain why \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" is here, unless they're trying to make reference to Tony Stark's emerging alcoholism (which was touched on in both movies, but has yet to be a major plot point - look for that in \\"Iron Man 3\\"). And \\"Cold Hearted Man\\" seems to be here solely to have a U.S. fan-baiting rarity on board for anyone who didn't wan to plunk down the money for the hefty \\"Backtracks\\" the previous year (the song also appears on the Austrailan version of \\"Powerage\\").<br /><br />Still, if you're on the fence about AC/DC and want a good sampler of their work, pick this up, and in fact if you throw in \\"Who Made Who\\" from 1986 (none of the songs from which are repeated here), you actually have a pretty fair representation of their greatest hits from then to now (since the band adamantly refuses to release best-of compilations), along with the requisite stragglers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is awesomness. Even though that might not be a word. Every one loves it! theres romance for the ladies but not to much that guys don't enjoy it! It is full of action, adventure, romance, and so much more! A must read.
B001HN6922|2.0|This sequel is really closer to 2.5 stars, but of course that's depending on one's own point of view.  While the movie is visually stunning, there is ALOT (and I mean alot) of violence in the form of explosions, threats, death-defying suspense, etc.  There are also scenes featuring the cars drinking martinis and pub lagers and lots of low-brow potty humor. The plots concerning Mater feeling out of the loop and about \\"big oil\\" can be very confusing to little children - obviously, this is meant to appeal to older kids and adults. I really don't understand how Disney/Pixar got away with a G rating when the content in this movie is obviously more for a PG film.  Other Pixar movies such as 'Up' (not to mention the Dreamworks animated films) have made great profits with PG ratings... what made Cars 2 exempt?<br /><br />In regard to the dvd itself, there are very few frills included - you have to upgrade to the blu-ray and 3D blu-ray to get the majority of the extra features.  Very frustrating for those not wanting to expand into a blu-ray collection.  Shame on Disney for this shady practice!  If you absolutely must purchase Cars 2, I suggest using an online coupon, or just purchasing this used!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Percy Jackson. Rick Riordan was a genius again. Yet Percy or Jason not having his mind I'm not a big fan of. I love being in Camp half blood again. I recomend reading the Percy Jackson books befor this though.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I was surprised that I liked this. I accidentally ran across it mid episode when channel surfing. I was intrigued enough to buy the first season on DVD. There was no going back after that. My only complaint is there are not enough episodes. I could watch this show every day. The story line is interesting, the acting is incredible. I am probably not the demographic the producers of this show is going for, but I will always be a fan.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Third installment in the transformers live action series. Not as good as the first two with some pretty major plot issues but great action sequences and good special effects. Fans of the series should certainly see this but don't watch expecting a mind blowing plot.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place.  Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price.  More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying.
030726999X|5.0|I am so excited to have found this book. I wanted to read it so much and when I found it I was so excited. Shipping was slow but the book is in great condition.
B000EGDAI4|4.0|Sonny Rollins is a master of the sax. This album will lift you and thrill you. If you are looking to set a mood for a special friend, Sonny provides perfect background music.
0756405890|5.0|I fell into this book in a way that I haven't for a long time. I found the imagery challenging and at times even ostentatious, yet so so sweet. The Name of the Wind will keep you reading, but bookworms beware, you HAVE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. It requires processing, contemplation, and even a few cruses the average skimmer will never appriciate. All in all a fantastic place to dwell.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|The last three albums Megadeth has put out I really enjoyed. 13 is no exception. I didn't think it could get any better after United Abominations but there isn't one song I skip while listening to 13. Black Swan is definetly my favorite because I enjoyed the demo on United Abominations but it sounds even better now that Dave and Crew took some time to polish it up a bit and  add those little extra guitar parts. Wrecker sounds really good to. Unlike some metal bands Megadeth is still having fun with their music and it shows. The songs are powerful, they rock, some are meaningful, and a few like Public Enemy # 1 are just plain simple and fun. Dave and Crew has never tried to be something they weren't and that's why they are still around today.
B000UH8BTK|5.0|For less than $15 dollars you are getting 5 CDs of excellent music by one of the great jazz fusion bands.  There are no frills with this package, there are no extras.  For me these packages are about downloading music into your music library and then synching into your IPod or whatever MP3 device you own and enjoy the great music that these CDs provide.  The sound quality is excellent as is the music.  With  Weather Report you get some of the most unique sounding music you will ever hear.  A mixture of jazz, world music, and funk  that is both free flowing and practically danceable at the same time.  You'll hear the evolution of this band as a post Miles Davis Bitches Brew free jazz fusion type sound led by ex Mile's bandmates Wayne Shorter and Josef Zawinul to some of the bands later CD's featuring the great Jaco Pastorius on bass.  You can not get a better value than what this package has to offer.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Agree with other reviewers that the \\"digital copy\\" is nothing of the sort. Maybe if they'd said \\"cloud copy\\" or something, it wouldn't be so bad. I often turn to Airplane mode to watch a film with minimal interruptions, and drain less battery. With the awful UltraViolet thing, I have to basically keep my iDevices plugged in and hope my connection stays decent, or I've gotten nothing at all. Definitely won't be buying another UltraViolet movie.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|It starts out with the immortal lyric 'I would cut my legs and tits off' which happens to be the most dramatic opener in music for some time. What really intrigues me, for all the negative professional reviews of this work, all indicate that it is not a total failure and it should be taken seriously. This is simply sitting on the fence, as most of these critics are worried that in a few months or years down the road, this material will be considered a masterpiece, just like Berlin. Some of the most consistent criticisms relate to the length of the record, which is a sad reflection on our society, that we can no longer invest our time and intelligence in a work of art. How dare these artists record a work longer then 45 minutes!!! Junior Dad alone is worth $9.99, it is a most beautiful and realized LuLu piece with excellent lyrics and music which perfectly compliments the vision. I urge you to be open minded, purchase this record and get a life. Stop seeking metal 'riffs' etc..step back, listen and let it consume you. This record is a classic. We should praise Metallica and Lou Reed for taking a hugh risk and delivering something different and thought provoking. As an update to my review, a large number of the negative reviews are shameful as resort to crass stereotyping of the most cruel kind, in fact some comments are slanderous to the artists and am surprised they continue to be posted.

James, have a beer......You guys just suck now, you have officially received that award from some one who bought Kill'em all when it first came out in 1983.......One star because you can't select a negative star........
B005VGYA68|3.0|I actually received my dvd copy from the uk because in Australia we have to wait until December for release.  I have been a George Harrison fan for many years and I just could not wait to get my hands on this.  The dvd or blueray is surely only for the keen harrison/Beatle fan, if you are not - don't buy.  I am actually a little disappointed, and I actually most probably have expected too much.  I say that there was no inclusion of Badfinger and Splinter - George was strongly involved with them. These would have been worth the inclusion. The dvd focused more of the hara krishna stuff.  I also would have loved all his singles complete with video in this set. The strong point is that the mixing of those songs are awesome in 5.1 surround. Hopefully that will come next.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Tough times! Tough people last.  Every elected official, and everyone who owns a business, should be required to watch this movie. This movie does so much for anyone who has been hit in any way by our current economic crisis. At times it is hard to watch, but is shows how good people become great, can lose everything and yet survive, as they help others whose lives they touch, and become great again. Don't miss seeing this! It will change you forever, for the better.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Clearly this is one of the best albums of the year. Yes some of the songs are over-produced and dramatic, but that is part of what makes this album so great. Florence reminds me of an updated Annie Lennox and the Eurythmics. There is not a bad song on this album and there are too many standouts to name. Definitely get the UK version if you can. The extra demo and acoustic tracks are amazing as well. Instantly the number one album on my playlist for a long while probably.
B001AKTZO6|5.0|The Best Cajun,Rock,Folk,Country whatever album of ALL times . JCF at his best. He never topped this. A MUST have CD.
B001HN6922|5.0|After reading all the reviews to determine if I should buy this movie or not, I still bought it even though most were negative reviews. This movie is a much different movie from the first, but i still really liked Cars 2. Though I can't say it is better than the original, I still love this movie, and Pixar did amazing. I don't understand the negative reviews because I loved this movie. It wasn't the easist to understand, but it is great. It deserves five stars, and so that is what I gave it.
B005JLN9Z8|4.0|I like potty humor, I like 80's metal, I like to listen to good musicians. With Steel Panther you get all three, which is why I really enjoyed the first album and was looking forward to this. It's not a bad follow up at all,  and you can't complain about the price on a MP3 download. I think the stand outs on this one are Tiger Woods, 17 Girls In A Row, and Weenie Ride (I can't believe that I am analyzing a Steel Panther record). But when compared to Feel The Steel, I found some shortcomings on Balls Out. Overall, I don't think the lyrics are as clever, and lot of \\"terms\\" and themes get recycled throughout the album. It's also missing the blatant song parodies, as this record seems to be more of a generic parody of the genre (but executed perfectly). I also found that you have to listen a little harder to Steele's vocals to understand the lyrics. I got a few more laughs out of the first record. Perhaps I am being nitpicky- but that's the producer gene in me. This is still a great listen. If Feel The Steel is a home run, Balls Out is more like third base

0446547654|5.0|THE BEST OF ME is the story of two high school sweethearts whose love was cut short because they were born on opposite sides of the track. As all people sometimes mistakenly are, they were identified and labeled because of who their families were. Amanda Collier was born to a family that was considered to be well bred and upper crust, and were highly respected people in the community. She was expected to go to a good-standing college and marry a man who was compatible to her station in life. However, against her parents' wishes, she began seeing a young man whose family had been in and out of prison and whose main interests seemed to be a life of crime.  The townspeople feared the Coles. They were dangerous individuals who would not hesitate to hurt or kill someone who got in their way. They were from the wrong side of the tracks, and no one who was decent would have anything to do with them except Amanda. She saw that Dawson was different, and was one of two people who did not judge him based on where he came from or who his father was.  Their love was never meant to be, and because Dawson's love was true, he let Amanda go. He wanted her to attend college and have the life she was destined to have, the life she deserved to have. Amanda never forgot Dawson, but eventually moved on. She went to college, met and married a respectable man, and raised a family. She lived the life she had been expected to live.  Dawson's life, on the other hand, did not go the way people expected. Instead of living the life of crime his father and cousins wished him to have, Dawson left town after an altercation with family and a tragic accident that put him in jail. Once he was out, he was determined never to set foot in that town again.  Things happen for a reason, and we meet people for a reason. Some may call it Fate. When their mutual friend passes away, a man who in some ways became a mentor to both of them, his last request brings both Amanda and Dawson back to that small town inNorth Carolina, changing their lives in ways neither would have imagined.  It has been a few years since I have read a Nicholas Sparks novel that has touched me as much as this one has. If I can pick my favorites from him, THE BEST OF ME will rank with MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and THE NOTEBOOK --- it was THAT good. I am not one to throw out compliments and praise lightly, either. I will admit, though, that I am a sucker for a good old-fashioned tragedy, one that requires a box of tissues and a good cry. The story of Amanda and Dawson is that of star-crossed lovers, two people who will always love one another but are destined to be apart. Choices they make as individuals create a chain of events that inexplicably affect other lives. And one can say it is the story of our own lives, in that sometimes we wish we could turn back the clock and change one decision we had made in the past, so that we can create a new life that we wished we had instead. Choices are made that create a fork in the road, a new destiny for both Amanda and Dawson that changes everything.  I liked the way Sparks laid out the different parts of the book, starting with the backstory and slowly working his way to the present. The pace of the novel starts out slow, but as the story progresses, things start to move at a much faster rate. I read the last half of the book in one sitting, staying up late one night because I could not put it down. One always has a feeling of foreboding in a good Nicholas Sparks book, and I was poised and ready to find out what happens to Amanda and Dawson and whether or not they get their happy ending.  Will readers get their happy ending? I can promise that there is both a classic Nicholas Sparks tragedy but with a twist of hope. It is bittersweet yet satisfying. If it had ended any other way, this would not have been a Nicholas Sparks novel. He is always at his best when he sticks to his formula of the star-crossed lovers.  Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton

It is a MUST READ!
0062011847|5.0|SNUFF finds Commander Samuel Vimes in the Middle Shires of England, completely out of his natural habitat of the dark and dank capital city of Ankh-Morpork on the planet called Discworld. His beloved wife, Lady Sybil, who not only raises their young son, Sam Jr., but also breeds dragons as a hobby, has declared that Sam, Jr. needs to get in touch with his landed gentry roots. She also insists that her husband take a vacation.  So Sam reluctantly turns over his badge and sword and all other weapons (except for those that can be secreted on his person without suspicious bulges) and sets off with his family and his gentlemen's gentleman, Willikins, to the vast Ramkin family estate. They are met by a retinue of footmen, household servants, a butler and housekeeper, game keepers, gardeners, and even a hermit. Vimes settles in for a month of fresh air, birdsong, grazing cows, moonlight and constellations. He takes leisurely walks beside flowing streams with his son, identifying wildlife of a sort far different from that encountered in the city.      Discworld is a planet of diverse population. Along with the usual assortment of humans and domestic livestock found on Earth, it is not out of the ordinary to hobnob with Golems and witches, vampires, werewolves, dwarves or zombies, some of whom wear the uniform of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch under Vimes's command. Goblins, however, are not found in Ankh-Morpork. Perhaps it is because they prefer to live in caves that, if there ever were caves in the ancient city, would all be flooded. In Ankh-Morpork, the waters of the River Ankh don't flow, they ooze.     Birds, should they accidentally venture above the city, would probably cough and plunge to earth, and no one has seen stars, let alone constellations unless they've been hit on the head with a truncheon. On Discworld, goblins are generally thought of as vermin and treated as such --- loathsome, smelly creatures useful for scaring children into behaving by chanting \\"Be goodor the goblins will get you.\\" The idea that they may be sentient beings capable of speaking and creating music and artifacts has gone unnoticed so far.       Sam soon senses, as he walks the streets of the village, that something is amiss in the idyllic atmosphere of sunshine and verdant pastures. His cop antenna fairly sizzles at an undercurrent of malice. A horrific crime has been committed on his land, and the entire village seems to be covering it up. The cop inside the vacationing lord of the manor cannot lay aside his sword and shield until he sniffs out the terrible deed.       A sojourn in the countryside turns into an adventure on the high seas, roiling rivers and, gods forbid, even racing through a raging storm in the dark of night on horseback. The only thing in all of Discworld that Sam is afraid of is horses, but he must rely on one to bring a mass murderer to justice.      Of his announcing that he has Alzheimer's and the recent bestowal of Knighthood by Queen Elizabeth, Terry Pratchett tells his friend and fellow author, Neil Gaiman, \\"Ever since I stood up and talked about my Alzheimer's I have been a public figure; I visited Downing Street twice, wrote angry letters to the Times, got into debates in the House of Commons, and generally became a geezer to the extent that I sit here sometimes bewildered and think to myself, 'Actually, your job is to sit here writing another book. Changing the world is for other people...' and then I come back to myself with, 'No it isn't!' And so, bearing in mind that these days, people call a kid from the council houses \\"Sir\\" better allows me to create a mindset for (Commander) Vimes.\\" And so here is #37 in the Discworld series. Meet Sir Samuel Vimes.  Reviewed by Roz Shea
B004EPZ07U|4.0|First off, I'm a huge Green Lantern fan. He's one of my favorite comic book characters (right behind Superman, who's my favorite.) I was there at the midnight opening, with merely a few others, I thought that was a bad sign because Thor/X-Men were pretty full for their midnight releases. After the movie, me and my friends agreed it was decent and definitely not as bad as the critics made it out to be. I actually ended up seeing it twice throughout it's theatrical run and enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time. When I heard the Blu-Ray was going to have an Extended Cut I was really happy. I was thinking \\"It just needed more Oa/Sinestro scenes!\\" Unfortunately, the EC doesn't have any of that. In the EC it includes scenes of Hal's childhood, and little bit more of an extended scene with Hal and his nephew at his birthday party. Surprisingly, it helps out the first act of the film quite a bit. In fact, I was watching it with my brother and he said to me, \\"when does the movie start to suck again?\\" After watching it quite a few times, I can honestly say I enjoyed GL. It does have its obvious flaws, but you can still enjoy it. I think why fans are so hard on it is because we know what GL could have been. Does \\"Space-Opera\\" and \\"Star Wars of Comic Book Movies\\" sound familiar? Yeah.   Now I was kinda letdown with the score, it does have some decent spots, but overall it was fairly average. The complete CGI suit looked decent at best. I think they should have been more practical and had Ryan Reynolds wear a real suit and added some CGI to it, so it still feels like a living thing or give it that \\"alienistic\\" feel they were going for.   Now I think the cast was pretty great for the most part, mainly Ryan Reynolds. The only thing that really bugged me was Hector's \\"mating call\\" scream. I'm sorry, but it was kinda funny.  Still, it seems to be selling well on BR. Despite it's somewhat of a flop at the B.O. it seems people may have been holding out for this one to hit DVD/BRand get it instead of seeing it at the cinema. I do hope it does well, because I'd like to see a sequel.   Can't wait for The Dark Knight Rises & Man of Steel! :)

It rivals 2011 releases such as Anthrax's \\"Worship Music\\" and Five Finger Death Punch's \\"American Capitalist.\\" Dave Mustaine is on top of his game throughout the record and his lyrical content is better than ever. Some of his lyrics really hit home considering the current state of the American psyche. If you are a Megadeth fan, you will enjoy this. If you are a hard rock/metal fan or a newer fan of Megadeth you will definitely enjoy this latest record! Highly recommend!

B004XWLHI0|5.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand not more than 30 minutes ago.<br /><br />This film is a PG-13 version of Single White Female, which I admit, I have not seen, but the plot is similar, hence the comparison to the film which starred Bridget Fonda (daughter of the late great Academy Award winning actor Henry Fonda) and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The movie just pulls you in from the first frame and never lets you go until the final image fades from the screen. Ms. Kelly and Ms. Meester are really good actresses, in addition to being stunningly beautiful. Same goes for Ms. Michalka (please excuse me if i got her name wrong). I quite enjoyed it. SPOILER ALERTS!!! I wish the love scene which was skilfully intercut with Rebecca posing as Sara while talking to Jason on the phone had included some nudity. Same goes for the shower scene with Tracey. I also wish the movie had included flashbacks of Sara's relationship with Emily, how she died and how both of them get along with their parents. The romance between Sara and Stephen was well-done. The scene where Rebecca murders Jason while having sex with him is remeniscent of a scene from Basic Instinct, which is another movie I have not seen. Very well done. Also, I would have liked to know what the girl outside the diner meant when she looked at Rebecca and said, \\"We were never friends.\\" Why did she say that? This part of the plot was left undeveloped, and it would have been nice to see that fleshed out. SPOILER ALERTS OVER!!! Billy Zane also does a commendable job as the professor. Hypnotic and with its jumpy moments, spiced with some humour. I recommend this movie. (I seriously wish I had a girlfriend like Ms. Kelly; I'm single...and ugly). Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies from Mrs. Crawford. I saw this movie on TCM but they didnt sell it. Found it on Amazon. DVD was in perfect condition and delivery was quick and easy. Will buy more classics from same vendor.
B000083C8Y|4.0|Note: I saw this with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This movie is pretty darn good. I don't normally go for comedies, except The Three Stooges, Charlie Chaplin, Tom And Jerry and The Looney Toons. But this film actually has a lot of funny moments. The techno music during the shopping montage was a bit much, though (I don't really like techno music that much; I prefer classical music). The story itself is actually really good. Plenty of suspense all the way through. Some flashbacks to Hubert's past with Miko would have been nice, though, along with a resolution to his love life. I didn't like the transvestites at the beginning, hence the four stars. I did like it when Hubert beat the crap out of them. Should have been rated PG-13.
0439023521|5.0|In a futuristic world, the United States, now called Panem, is divided into 12 districts. At one point, there was one more, but the 13th district was destroyed to quash a rebellion. Each year, the government, in order to remind the 12 remaining districts of the brutality of the rebellion and as a means of controlling its citizenry, holds the Hunger Games, in which a male and female representative from each district is chosen and subsequently must fight to the death in an arena the government has devised. The Games are televised and it is mandated that each citizen must watch; another maneuver to thwart rebellion and to instill compliance. The winner will live a life of luxury for the rest of their life; the only caveat, they must mentor subsequent competitors from their district. 16-year-old Katniss lives in District 12, known as the mining district and one of the poorest. Since her father's death, Katniss has been sole provider for her family and is an expert hunter. When her sister is chosen for the Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The male chosen is Peeta, the baker's son, who once saved Katniss and her family from starvation. Although Katniss does not want to go into the Games owing anyone, she cannot deny Peeta's charitable nature. During the opening ceremonies, Peeta declares his unrequited love for Katniss, endearing them to viewers. Now Katniss is indebted to him more, because as the favored couple, they will receive gifts to help them during the Games. If it comes to a fight between Katniss and Peeta, will she be able to kill the young man to whom she owes so much?<br /><br />Collins depicts a cruel world in which the government controls every aspect of its citizens' lives and freedom seems unattainable. The author excels at revealing the complexities of the characters, including tertiary ones. Although Katniss seems a cold, calculating young woman, deep down, she cares for others yet is wary of acknowledging these feelings, even to herself. Peeta is personable, a warm, gentle young man who does everything he can to protect Katniss, even when it doesn't appear he is doing so. When he declares his love for Katniss, she isn't sure if this is true or if this is a ruse to gain more favor for himself. The Games are brutal and vividly depicted. The plot is excellent and moves along at a fast pace. Readers will root for Katniss and Peeta in the first book of this galvanizing trilogy.sonable, a warm, gentle young man who does everything he can to protect Katniss, even when it doesn't appear he is doing so.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is not grand drama, nor oscar winning script. This is fun. This is snorting your lemonade out of your nose because you just caught a line or scene from a totally different movie. This made us laugh out loud in a few places and is a film that will be watched again.<br /><br />You probably already have the background: \\"Paul\\" is an alien who crash landed in Wyoming, got taken by the Men In Black and has been held for the last 60 years. With a little help from a friend he escapes and is trying to get back to a pickup site. (Guess where THAT is!)  Along comes Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, tourists from England, who become his new BFF's and try to make that happen. Kristen Wiig is very good as the religious girl who gets some eye-opening (literally) views.<br /><br />I liked seeing Jason Bateman, Jeffrey Tambor, Jane Lynch and other fine actors do their thing. The special effects are wonderful, the sly (or blantant) illusions to other movies are great, the acting is top notch and the story line, if used before, is still worth seeing again. Paul's voice, Seth Rogen, is good. We go through most the movie wondering who \\"the big guy\\" is and when we find out, it is just freakin' perfect. Truly.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|When I got my new Sprint iPhone 4s, I quickly began researching cases. The choice I thought was obvious was the Otterbox commuter. Unfortunately, though it seems to offer great protection, it was too bulky & did not correctly fit he 4s.  Next, I tried the Griffin Reveal. Total switch from the otter box w/ it's low profile & minimum protection, but it looked dirty in 2 days (it was white, to accent my phone, which is white).  Based on the great reviews & price, I decided to give the Amazon Basics clear case a try. When it came in the mail, I didn't like the look of it on or off my phone, but it seemed to have great protection, so I put it on as I decided to continue my search for the perfect case. After 24 hours, I loved it.  It protects the phone well & shows off the beauty of the white iPhone.  It feels sturdy & non-slick in my hand, does not pick up pocket lint, and is decently low profile.  The circles on the back are okay with me, b/c they prevent the rainbow effect of other clear cases.  I love this case, and my search is over, b/c this is staying on my phone. Great case! Well done, Amazon!

I have to agree with those who were disappointed in this book.  I almost aborted it until the second third of the book finally kicked in, but the last third was disjointed and forced.  It felt like Ms. Morton couldn't figure out how to end it and added every \\"tortured\\" possibility to see what would stick.  Three stars is probably too much, but the middle third of the book kept me wanting to finish it and at least made it worth my while.

He makes great characters, has an impressively scientific magical system, and does a great job of foreshadowing without revealing everything.

Simply a great read for any sci-fi/fantasy readers.
B005SMUW8U|5.0|Only Tom Waits could do what he does on this album. I am not into track by track analysis. I want to address why this album is important and is an album few artists, perhaps even only Tom Waits, could release. What I mean is this. Tom Waits has released an album of entirely new material and it sounds like a \\"greatest hits\\" compendium at the same time. To  listen to this album is to be introduced to Tom Waits for the first time and  to make his acquaintance again. He is your brand new oldest musical friend. He is brand new and he is eternal. He cannot so much as cough and not sound musical. He is master of his domain and he is just beginning to discover the wealth and depth of his talent.<br />I first became aware of Tom Waits in the very early '70's. I am a huge Zappa fan. My girlfriend had, for my birthday, gotten us tickets to 2, two, count 'em, two Frank Zappa's shows in the month of April, 1972. The first was at the vaunted OrpheumTheater in downtown Boston. The opening act was Ram-A-Tam, the waste of time band put together by Jimi's drummer since Jimi had died. Pity anyone who opened for Zappa. You were bound to be booed off the stage. The second show was at the gymnasium, sit on the floor, at Lowell Tech College. The opening act was some nobody named Tom Waits. So, with the huge balls it took to open for Zappa, there he stood. Famous beard, smokes, hat and attitude. I was hoping it would be over soon. It was just him, his piano and an electric bass player. I wish I could tell you what he played, but I can't. I only know I was blown away. I think the best summary of what he was like then is captured on the somewhat hard to find album, \\"The Dime Store Novels, Vol. 1. I remember being utterly blown away. Here I was, planning to tolerate another period of \\"please hurry up and let the REAL musicians play,\\" moment. Here stood this utterly confident, unassuming guy who sang with a growl, played piano like the genius he is and kept time by banging his hat on his thigh when he wasn't at the piano. He may have done \\"Diamonds on My Windshield,\\" but I can't say for certain. I only know that for the first time I was at a Zappa concert and was SAD when the opening act, Mr. Waits, was done. I wanted more. I was amazed. This statement of amazement can only be contextualized properly by realizing that I was a HUGE fan of FZ.<br />Tom went from there to putting together a body of work that is beyond compare. He is an artist. He is a musicologist. He has more American music history in his little pinky than the libraries and curricula of many schools who offer degrees in music. I went to Berklee, so I know something of what I speak.<br />He is a songwriter. I imagine he has made a nice little nest egg just from people covering some of his songs, such as 'Ol 55, Closing Time and Temptation (Diana Krall of all people), just to name a few. Oh yeah, I should include \\"On A Downtown Train,\\" too.<br />He could have rested on his laurels after creating and releasing his live album, \\"Nighthawks at the Diner,\\" which sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released. Then comes the \\"reinvention\\" or, as I like to put it, \\"ah, okay, that was fine but then thee's this, and along comes, \\"Bone Machine\\" and \\"The Mule Variations,\\" (you got to get behind the mule). and then thee's \\"Black Rider,\\" then a string of utterly amazing albums which, getting myself out of order chronologically, gave us \\"Rain Dogs,\\" \\"Heart Attack and Vine,\\" \\"Blue Valentine\\" and \\"Small Change\\" (I'm not listing them all, dammit) and \\"Swordfish Trombones,\\" and \\"Frank's Wild Years.\\" Then came the previously mentioned movement to what I will summarize as the \\"Mule Variations\\" segment.<br />Then he releases a multi=disc set of songs that didn't make it over the years, \\"Orphans, Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards,\\" which contained what many of us feel are some of his best work. He releases two completely different albums, \\"alice\\" and \\"Blood Money\\" AT THE SAME TIME! I admit I have days when I just have to hear \\"Tabletop Joe\\" or things just won't feel right.<br />To make what is already a too long review longer, brings us to \\"Bad As Me (Deluxe Edition).<br />It is a work of pure genius of the sort of which Tom Waits is capable. It is at once new and different and utterly familiar. New songs that sound like the history of Tom Waits' career. This album is living proof of the obvious; ;there is and only ever will be, one Tom Waits. Not in style, never. Always at the forefront and instantly recognizable, yet, at the same time, an unknown. A brand spanking new album of completely new material that is old and familiar at the same time.<br />He is utterly unique. He is an unqualified genius of the musical world. He is known to millions; he is known to almost no one. He is the best at what he does and what he does no one else can do. He just goes about his life being Tom Waits, gift, blessing, devil-worker, genius, dense, complex, simply and utterly musically enjoyable. What I did was download the regular edition and then the three extra tracks from the deluxe edition separately and there you have it. Pure genius, pure enjoyment, pure Americana, pure Tom Waits.\\"Tabletop Joe\\" or things just won't feel right.  To make what is already a too long review longer, brings us to \\"Bad As Me (Deluxe Edition).   It is a work of pure genius of the sort of which Tom Waits is capable. It is at once new and different and utterly familiar. New songs that sound like the history of Tom Waits' career. This album is living proof of the obvious; ;there is and only ever will be, one Tom Waits. Not in style, never. Always at the forefront and instantly recognizable, yet, at the same time, an unknown. A brand spanking new album of completely new material that is old and familiar at the same time.   He is utterly unique. He is an unqualified genius of the musical world. He is known to millions; he is known to almost no one. He is the best at what he does and what he does no one else can do. He just goes about his life being Tom Waits, gift, blessing, devil-worker, genius, dense, complex, simply and utterly musically enjoyable. What I did was download the regular edition and then the three extra tracks from the deluxe edition separately and there you have it. Pure genius, pure enjoyment, pure Americana, pure Tom Waits.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|I've been a Hugh Laurie fan for years, from the days of \\"A Bit of Fry and Laurie.\\"  I came to the TV series \\"House\\" a bit late - network TV is so often a waste of time.  I'm glad I finally caught up on the whole series.  Mr. Laurie gets to not only display his considerable comedic skills, he's also proven to be a superb actor.  Viewers of House have seen him occasionally play a bit of piano and guitar. \\"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\\" often had him playing as well, although in support of humor.  Now \\"Let Them Talk\\" demonstrates well just how committed to the blues Mr. Laurie is, and how well he can interpret the music.  He's surrounded by a cast of excellent musicians, and producer Joe Henry makes them all shine.  Many classic songs are interpreted, and giants like Dr. John, Irma Thomas and Tom Jones (showing he still has amazing vocal chops) contribute mightily. I especially enjoyed the grooves they achieved on songs I had heard many times.  Real music with real players - who could ask for more?    Get the special edition if it's still available. Nice packaging and booklet for a real keeper of a CD.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|As most folks here, I grew up with the Sound of Music on VHS.  Now that I'm older, it was a delight to revisit this classic and see the movie as an adult.  There is a lot of depth to the characters that I didn't see before!  On top of that, the Bluray presents a level of detail that is a true visual treat.  The cinematography in this movie is brilliant and features so much detail in sets and fabrics that simply could not be seen in VHS.
B005RUV6RO|5.0|I was hesitant at first to start watching this show. I have heard good things about it, but sometimes good shows get off track i.e., \\"Lost\\" or \\"The X-files\\". Plus, I only have so much time and another tv show to watch seemed too much. What a mistake! This show is good. The production values are very high. Good cinematography. The plot line is similiar to any zombie apocalypse movie but that isn't what makes this show. They work very hard to build up the suspense and I find myself curled up on the couch yelling \\"don't do it, don't do it\\" only to find that it wasn't a zombie about to eat someone after all. This show, for those who look beyond the zombie premise, will find real, deep, and well thought out moral juxtapositions and what would you do questions. The characters are well thought out and developed and it makes it really difficult at times to guess who if anyone will die and hard to \\"lose\\" someone. A very well thought out show. Give it a try.
B0013Y1GEQ|4.0|Being a huge fan of the original Japanese movie, I had to see what America did with it.  I was pleased to find an enjoyable movie that was faithful to the original story while not being afraid to add to it a bit.  Some things don't translate well to an American setting, though (middle-aged guys being bashed for ballroom dancing? really???), and the intimate dance between Richard and Jennifer ruined the innocence that makes the Japanese movie so special while destroying any believability that the main character was a dancer that had been studying for only a few months.  Finally, they dropped the F-bomb at the end of the movie, which I felt was crude and unnecessary.  That said, I still give it 4 stars.
0783225903|4.0|I've seen the movie on VHS before and my dad totally loves it. So I was very excited to find it out on DVD for a reasonable price. So I bought it  for him for his fifteeth birthday and he has watched it over 23 times already.

This is more than just a peak into what could have been it's a peak into the creative process.<br />To be truthful, there is a lot of stuff contained in this set and some of it can be tiresome, but in the end you can finally get a grasp of what Brian Wilson was trying to do, even though at that moment in time, he did not.<br /><br />Keep in mind that there was never an album called \\"SMiLE\\" released because the project was left unfinished. That would happen 36 years later when all the loose ends of the tapestry were finally knitted into a collective whole by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks.<br /><br />What we have here is the \\"SMiLE\\" sessions with the Beach Boys providing the vocals and other instrumentation over the backing Brian recorded while the band was on tour. There has been enough said about the drama that unfolded during these sessions so I will just describe to you what is here.<br /><br />You get 5 CD's of the \\"SMiLE\\" sessions including a running order which is basically a mock up of what the album would have been like if it was finished.

081095415X|5.0|I looked at this book over the course of about two years at a local bookstore when I was there for various author's readings. Spending $50 on a photo book is not something I do often or without all due consideration before hand. (and as it turned out, I spent less than that by buying through Amazon) Every image in this book is great. Many are wonderful. There are four that hold me mesmerized....transfixed by the majesty and dignity of the regal lion. I recommend the book without hesitation. it's one of the most impressive groups of images that I've ever seen.
B003AYZBM0|5.0|Entertaining read. Very dramatic at times. Having recently been to Maya Island in Thailand where the movie was shot made the experience even better.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|If you like paranormal activity, blair witch, and other lost footage movies you will like this for sure. Check it out!

0385534639|5.0|Different is good. Or in the case of The Night Circus, different is AMAZING! The Night Circus is easily one of my favorite books of the year.  You know why?  Because it is SO DIFFERENT.  There is absolutely nothing ordinary about it. Everything, read that, everything is special about this book.  The circus comes to life at night and it is overflowing with contradictions. The circus is breathtakingly beautiful, but yet it has ugly secrets beneath the surface. The circus is entertaining, but these performers are doing much more than simply entertaining the crowd. The circus is literally black and white, but the real story is as colorful as an extra-large box of crayons.  I loved that nothing was really what it seemed to be and the circus held so many secrets.   This circus has magical performers. They perform telekinesis, illusions, and complex spells with names I cannot pronounce. Celia and Marco, the stars of the circus, are made to fight each other with magic. It's yet another fabulous contradiction, because these two are in love. I could actually FEEL the tension all wrapped up in their strong desire for each other. Celia and Marco's relationship spans several decades, but they age extremely slowly. Theirs is a story of true and deep love.  No insta-love.  No love triangle.  No jerky guys.  No clueless girls.  It's that REAL LOVE that everyone searches for.  The other circus performers are vividly described with unique talents and their own long histories. My favorites were the twins who were born on the very night the circus opened. Watching them grow up as the story went along was a treat. The Man in the Gray Suit, that was his name, was one of the trainers that I loathed. He was just dripping with evilness.  I even think the gray color of his suit had something to do with how he just didn't fit into the black and white circus.    Erin Morgenstern has written a magnificent story where she ties the lives of her characters together into one fantastic bundle. Thereis suspenseful pacing and compelling action kept me turning pages in a reading FRENZY. As a stand-alone, The Night Circus has a fitting ending. I am impatiently waiting for Erin Morgenstern's next masterpiece.  RATING  5 Loved  COVER COMMENTS  Thank you for playing up the black and white circus theme! I'm not sure where the hint of red comes in, but it does make the cover easier to look at. I love that starry night too!

B005NPLXJ4|3.0|\\"We do what we want, and if people don't like it..then whatever. It's our thing.\\" -Cliff Burton from an interview as featured on \\"Cliff 'Em All\\" discussing how metal fans of the mid-80's considered Metallica a 'sell-out' because they had acoustic guitars in their songs (Battery, Fight Fire With Fire, Fade to Black). Fast forward to the \\"Re-Load\\" days with Kirk Hammet then saying: \\"People think there is some kind of message with us. The message is..there is no message!\\" The parallel truth of both Burton and Hammet's statements cannot be denied. And it really doesn't pertain more to Lulu than any other album they've done (including \\"St.Anger\\".  Most will discount this album as an artistic abomination outlaying both fans of Metallica and fans of Lou Reed- but you must take the album for the context. It is not the follow up to \\"Death Magnetic\\". It is a piece of work from two entities that are champions in their own artistic field: Lou Reed as a classic rock/ art rock icon, Metallica as an American metal rock icon. The experiment fails, however. Lou Reed is the killer on this album. His spoken word attempt at poetry is really lost on the album. The music is droning, repetitive, and mis-calculated. It sounds as though someone recorded Metallica when doing a sound check before a concert and decided to overlay the spoken words of an outdated, irrelevant, musician who brings nothing to the table in this entire album. In the end, it looks like Metallica and Lou Reed are doing exactly what they want sans the favorable opinions of their fans. But it really doesn't matter. Metallica could go out tonight and sell out 50,000 seats at a local civic center and perform a great show playing songs from their first three albums. Lou Reed hasn't played in front of more than 5,000 people since performing at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert with ..guess who? ...Metallica. This album will be considered a novelty, attractive to only the hipsters , and pseudo-intelluctuals who \\"totallyget it\\" when it comes to investing their street corner wisdom toward a fake, implanted image in their minds.
B001HN6922|5.0|The first CARS movie was a huge hit in our family when my oldest son was 4.  We saw CARS2 at the theater and it renewed his childhood love of these characters, and now all 3 of my kids love the movies and characters so we couldn't wait for the DVD to be released. I heard the mixed reviews before i saw the movie in the theater, and don't really understand them.  The 2nd movie is great because it is action packed, has a great story line and characters without being a recycled version of the first one (i didn't read too deep into the political agenda, and i am as right wing as they get!).  Regarding the violence, I realize one car actually \\"died\\" although I did explain to my kids that cars are different than people and can be fixed.  And in fact, after watching again, some of the cars that got their engines blown out did in fact re-appear in the next race, just like real life where you put a new engine in a car if it blows.  Yes, the story is complicated but that is a plus for me - there is something for everyone.  My kids who are 8, 5 and 2 all get something different out of it at their own level of understanding, and so do I(a huge Bond fan so maybe this was just up my alley!).  We just got the DVD from Amazon and watched it - it will be a regular go to movie in our house, its one that can be watched over and over and I have very few movies I consider in that category!
B005EYP8PO|3.0|The title of the review sums it up. Achtung Baby is one of my top 5 favorite albums. And, although I'm glad that I bought this reissue, it could have been better. First and foremost, the sound is great. Although I have to say that I really don't detect a ton of difference between this and the original pressing. If you're the odd person that doesn't already own Achtung Baby, it's a no brainer, go out and get it.   However I also have to say that I'm a little disappointed in both the package and the selection of the extra tracks for the standard 2 disc set. The previous cd's in the U2 catalog got a great package of a small hardback book in a slipcase. Great liner notes, lyrics to not only the album, but also some of the bonus content, extra photos from the era...etc. This time it's just a standard fold over case, and the booklet inside is almost no different from the old one.  Now I understand that the amount of material from the sessions would have made it impossible to get everything that I would have loved to have on a 2 cd set, but it seems like all they really did with this set was compile the b-sides. With the exception of Blow Your House Down, all the material on disc 2 is pretty easy to get. They should have used the BSides and Other Stuff disc from the Super Deluxe Box set, there would have still been enough room to add a couple of live cuts...  So, great album, the reissue fall a little short for me in the package and extra tracks. I'd love to have the Super Deluxe Box, but I can't see spending the cash for another copy of Zooropa until it has all it's extras, I already have the DVD of the concert that's included, and I wouldn't watch them that much anyway...The sad thing is, I still hope that they give this reissue treatment it really deserves.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Very impressed with this album.  The usual great lyrics and outstanding guitar playing.  Thank you Megadeth for never selling out.  This is true metal.
B00005JOA0|1.0|I did not like this movie at all!  I found it very dark, telling a long drawn out tale of an abusive marriage.  The wife was considered angelic for putting up with so much, and nursing her dying husband at the end.  I did not consider it angelic, she should have left him much sooner then she did.  Also, where was her brother when she needed his help.  They dragged out the abuse for way too long.  I would have turned it off but I couldn't stop it on such a negative note.  We waited a long time for her husband to finally die, so she would be rid of him, and we could have some peace too!  I will never watch it again!
B003TML0VO|1.0|The first three Santana albums were awesome. After that Mr. Santana has been in a giant downward sell out spiral ever since.   This album is so bad it makes me angry.   Please, for the health of music and art, find the original artists this album mocks, enjoy their perfected craft and production and leave this waste of space sitting on the warehouse shelf.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|I'm getting more than a little peeved with VH1, MTV and U.S. record keeping groups when they refer to a-ha as a \\"one hit wonder\\" for the song \\"Take on Me.\\"<br /><br />There is no doubt that \\"Take on Me\\" is an incredible song, but just because American tastes run hot and cold doesn't mean that a-ha hasn't been cranking out hits for the past 25 years.<br /><br />Such is the case with Foot of the Mountain. The title song is an incredibly heartfelt and moving song. Throughout the album, Harket's vocals are more mature (as befits his age) and there is little need for him to prove that he is a master vocalist (he's already done that). Pal and Mags and Morten have written a more intense and emotional album here.<br /><br />By and large these are love ballads, but not of the bubble-gummy type. These are mature men writing songs to their wives and to their children.<br /><br />You've got to get this to see why Europe, South America and Asia have had a love affair with a-ha all these years and why they are a multi-platinum group - even if not in the U.S.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|So you already wasted your money and your wondering what the h*ll happened to Metallica? I mean who in there right mind would want Lou Reed to sing on their album?  Metallica is over let's face it! They haven't made a good album in years and they seem to have no respect for their fans. Many older bands from the 80's like Guns n Roses and Van Halen seem to feel the same way. (Eddie Van Halen and Axl Rose). So have a few drinks listen to the music and laugh all night long! I mean this is hilarious and it should definitely receive an award for THE BEST COMEDY ALBUM OF THE YEAR!  These guys need to start drinking again and they need to start drinking a lot! THIS SUCKS! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B0052GACNM|4.0|I was a huge fan of the first Duets album. I had wondered for a few years if a 2nd one had been released, then finally saw a notice that Duets II was out. I headed to Amazon and to order a copy. I was surprised that the rating was only 3 stars. I enter my order anyway and awaited delivery. I spoke to my daughter-in-law and told her I had placed my order and the first thing she said was that it only had 3 stars. So, by the time the CD arrived my expectations were on the low side, but I was still anxious to hear it. After I listen the first time, I agreed that it did not have the same initial impact as the first. But, as I've listened over the past few weeks I've come to really appreciate Duets II! I especially like the songs with Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse. The first album contains the best song Tony had to offer, many of which were classics. With II I was not as familar with the material, or knew them from other covers. I hope you end up enjoying Duets II as much as I have.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie all the way until the final scenes.  How can you call a movie CAPTAIN AMERICA and then have Nick Fury come on the scene riding a slew of Acura vehicles.  It totally destroyed what the movie stood for, for me.  All the really sharp Cadillacs, Lincolns and Chrysler vehicles available today and they decided to end an \\"ALL AMERICAN\\" production with Made In Japan.
B005XI91FY|5.0|Tasteless? Without question. Hilarious? Absolutely. Wigs and spandex? Very prevalent.  Great music? YES!  The sad fact is that if these guys had 1) serious lyrics and 2) came out in 1984, there would be a Behind the Music documentary about them on TV now. Perhaps they would've have been as big as Motley Crue, but they are really good.  What about the album you ask? It's better than the first. It doesn't have as many lyrics that made me laugh out loud (see Community Property on Feel the Steel), but musically this is a far better album. The real stand outs are the vocals and lead guitar. Granted, the lead guitar player recycles a lot of 80s riffs, but you really need to know your 80s hair metal to hear it. Michael Starr (fake name: he used to sing in LA Guns) can sing anything. (Check out their cover of Don't Stop Believin' by Journey).   It sometimes makes me sad to think that they didn't \\"make it\\" in the traditional sense. And the sexual references are so frequent and vulgar that it can be annoying and juvenile. But check out some youtube clips of them playing Van Halen's \\"Hot For Teacher\\" or Guns n Roses' \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and you'll see that these guys are great musicians and performers and clearly love what they're doing.  Best album tracks:  Supersonic Sex Machine  17 Girls in a Row  Just Like Tiger Woods  If you really, really love me  Those (4) songs alone were worth the $5.99 I paid for the download.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|Ok, Puss in Boots is definitely cute. He is very lovable and such a sweet little bandit/hero. The movie is similar to other animated ones: funny, cute, adventurous... although not half as funny as the Shrek movies, in my opinion.  But I probably wouldn't even be writing a review if it wasn't for the BIG, HUGE... should I call it MISTAKE (?) of the way Spain is pictured. They mention they are in Spain so there is no confusion here: it IS Spain... although absolutely NOTHING Spanish is anywhere to be seen. The characters all talk with a mix of american and mexican accents (except Antonio Banderas, obviously) and the towns/clothing/scenery is all DESERT!!! Hello?!? Has anyone ever been to Spain?!? Where are all those extended deserts and dusty towns? I am from Spain and I have NEVER seen them. This is very offensive to ANYONE from Spain, and although it's definitely not the first time it happens (especially in movies with Antonio Banderas who obviously doesn't fully understand where he is from)... I didn't expect this in a NEW animated movie of this caliber. This is a mistake many movies and books make... but nonetheless a very serious one.  I don't regret having gone to see the movie, though. My young kids didn't seem offended and enjoyed it, and I guess that's what counts.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Top notch! Easy to put on my phone and the rubber doesn't pull back when I remove the phone from my pocket. In fact, the phone slides around well in my pocket unlike other cases that are difficult to drop into your pocket and remove from your pocket. I probably looked at 20 different cases and finally landed on this one. I'm more than satisfied.
B00004VW0V|5.0|The Hurt, Later and some parts of the Foreigner suit are the most beatiful music a person can do! Cat Stevens is one of the 5 top singers ever. I have this LP here in Brasil in 1973. Now I am listening to the CD. Unforgetable!
1423140591|5.0|I have been a fan of Rick Riordan ever since I read his Percy Jackson series. I read the first book in the Heroes of Olympus series and thought it was good, when I finished it I could not wait for the next one to come out so I could read and just let me say IT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR. I would say to anyone you read this series and you will not be disapointed. I think I should say that I am 31 years old and will continue to read Rick Riordan book's for as long as he will write them.
B000HL09SA|5.0|I thought I knew what to expect but there were some lovely unexpected moments.<br />The ending was foreordained, of course, but it completed the story.
B000817YF0|5.0|All I can say is that I am speechless. I am listening to East Hasting as I write this and I feel like I'm out of my skull. THIS ALBUM IS THE REASON TO BUY VINYL. The tracks are much longer that mp3 or CD cuts and the package as a while is astounding. The vinyl is a crisp 140 or 180 gram LP with almost ZERO warp or surface noise. On the vinyl itself is hand etched a message saying \\"Beautiful\\". The labels are a flat black and don't even tell you what song you are about to unleash. I say this because East Hastings takes up this entire side. The packaging is the original 1997 pressing and the red cover has the simple image on it of the sign and the black sky. While looking at the cross on the back three thing fell out. There was a print of a train, a falling bomb resembling a ticket, and a flattened Canadian penny, which from the damage on it I presume was done so by a train. No other LP has left my speechless by the presentation, quality and mystique of this package. For the price I paid (under $20) I state again, This album is the reason WHY WE BY VINYL RECORDS.<br /><br />Flawless, yet the flaws are what make it great.
B000H305U0|5.0|I only loosely knew of j timberlake as some sort of celebrity although i'm listening lots of music.  This album is absolutely outstanding and deserves 5* without slightest reservation, way beyond my expectations.  The guy who mentioned in his review that this cd is like prince at its best was spot-on.  The album is irresistibly funky and all the songs are excellent.  Given timberlake co-wrote all of them he definitely deserves lots of praise for this work.  The key additional take-away for me about this cd is the complexity of  the songs - not that they are all listenable, the way they are composed and sound suggests this is a work of people who are not only interested in making and selling hits but also profoundly enjoy making music .
0062059882|5.0|Awesome book, especially for road trips across the country. I would and have recommended it to almost anybody i know.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I feel this is one of the best stories which takes you into another class of people, that of the life from a servant's view of their employ under the wealthy.  It is beautifully done from the actor's chosen for each role, period costumes, the lavish country side of England and the indepth story of each charactor.  I personally enjoy most of the period pieces from England and this was not disappointing.
0393339882|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining books on the subject of Quantum physics I had the opportunity to read. Well written and documented, it offers a clear view on the debates which originated between  Einstein theories' supporters  and those who were rather convinced by the model developed by Bohr.  It would have been fascinating if the book could have continued narrating about how the story evolved concerning further theory developments, such as Standard Model, superstring, branes and so on.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case was everything I expected. Good quality, great snug fit and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone. A high quality product from Amazon at a really nice price. I saw similar cases go for $20 at the cell phone case kiosks in the mall.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|A rare bird in domestication finds itself in Rio because he's the last of his kind and needs to reproduce to continue the line but things get complicated. While I appreciated the panoramic views and animation details I found the humor and story and characters below what I would have expected. The love story was predictable. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus;  HUMOR: C minus to C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; ANIMATION: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2011; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Love the characters who are humorous; first part of book is a little wandering with mediocre comic like stereotypes of the \\"usual suspects\\" one might find in a small storefront law office--i.e. quickie divorces, DWIs, ambulance chasing. Like the dog, AC (ambulance chaser); book gets better and more believable as David Zinc learns the ropes while in court fighting \\"Big Pharma.\\" His character is more believable and can relate to with the reader. Book gets more technical and \\"lawyerly\\" with the courtroom scenes and the parade of characters before the Judge who fastracks the case. Think \\"Street Lawyer meets Pelican Brief\\" as a subtitle for this book which stays with his tried and true formula of interesting characters, fair plot, and great dialogue.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|This movie is a much smaller focus of INDEPENDENCE DAY minus all the soap opera and many subplots. Instead, it focuses on one group of U.S. forces fighting an alien invasion into L.A. The whole world is under siege but the tale is mostly kept on said forces with a gritty feel. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters were well developed and had actual back stories with substance. Urban fighting galore. Some really nice action scenes for bloodthirsty types like myself. Aaron Eckhart plays the reluctant leader marine who is just about to retire when the aliens show up. Most of picture was filmed in Shreveport and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, not Los Angeles, as it cut budget costs. An FPS video game was spun from this film. Critics were mixed in their opinions of this film but the Box Office ignored them. It cost $70M but made over $211M. It won't get Best Picture but it's good fun for those who like the genre.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; ACTION SCENES/CGI: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|This movie is excellent. When it first came out we thought not another Robin Hood remake in fact we didn't see it until it came on TV. We weren't expecting much. But was very surprized at what an excellent movie it was. As soon as we saw this 3 disc Unrated Director's Cut come out on Amazon.com I ordered it. When we watch it was even better then the original version.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|I loved Feel the Steel and was hopeful this would be as good.  It didn't disappoint.  I just listened to the entire CD and all the laughs are there plus the music tops the last album.  Don't be retarded and listen to their songs...
B005KJZDXK|2.0|I should have learned by now.  I am a big fan of M. Ward.  I like Zooey D's acting but not her singing.  I knew the first two CDs were basically Zooey, although I'm sure M. is mostly responsible for the arrangements and the production.  However, I am a sap for Christmas music, and I bought this CD without sampling it adequately...and I'm a chump.  Zooey's voice simply annoys me.  It is so cutesy and lilty.  She has a regular voice which she puts on display for the final track.  Her regular voice is just OK but still vastly preferable to the fakey \\"singing voice\\" she uses on the majority of these tracks.  I just do not get how M. Ward is professionally fulfilled by this project.  His solo music is so unique without being kitschy.  This CD, really the whole concept of this group, to me is pure kitsch.  I think it would be significantly improved if M. sang on it more.  They dueted on Rave On from an earlier M. Ward CD - that was really good but it is the only song with them together that I like.) I have heard them in interviews and really it's all Zooey.  Why is M. so happy remaining in the background?  I can believe that he is shy and might prefer to have someone else do the talking, but really, the music they are producing together is just not good.  End of rant.  I know this group has lots of fans and this will not be a popular POV but this music insults my ears.  Zooey has a perfect niche as an actress and she should stay there.  M. should move on to the next project.
0953104907|5.0|I checked this book out of the library when I was fourteen (in 1988) and between flipping through the pages and studying a bass that my uncle had built about twenty-three years before that!, I decided to build my own.    This was the one and only book that I used, and almost a quarter-century later that bass is still played, still my favorite instrument.  I was delighted to see that this is still in print, and after checking inside and seeing that the 8-string neck-through bass is still the \\"advanced\\" project in the book, I'm buying my very own copy just to reminisce and keep in my library.  I didn't build it as an eight-string, and so maybe someday...
B005FVA3LK|5.0|Okay I'm going to do my best to break down Achtung Baby Super Deluxe Edition.  First, the packaging: The set comes in a nice box that includes 16 LP size cardboard photos from the album sessions. The other part of the set is the book. The book is great with essays by Andrew Mueller, Daniel Lanois, Anton Corbijn, Martin Scholz, Martin Wroe, Brain Eno, and Bill Flanagan. There are also tons of photos and the hand written lyrics to \\"One\\". There are also several pages dedicated to the CDs and DVDs in the set with the track listings, times, original release info, etc. The one complaint is all of the CDs and DVDs are actually housed in the inside covers rather then having individual cases (got to get the Uber edition for that).  The Music: Most U2 collectors will have 85% of the music on these 6 discs. There have been some tweeks to Achtung Baby and I think it sounds great. Zooropa appears to be the same mix but is still a great album and I hope it gets its own edition when the time comes. Disc 3 is the first of the re-mix CDs. All have been release before except the final track which is \\"One (Apollo 440 Remix) which basically adds a new intro, throws some beats in the middle and tags on a new drum ending. That being said, Achtung Baby is an album that really lends itself to remixes but I think Disc 4 is the better of the remix CDs. Again Disc 4 has only one unreleased song. Another remix of \\"One\\" again by Apollo 440 but I prefer this \\"Ambient\\" mix to the one on Disc 3.  Discs 5 and (especially) 6 are the reasons most are buying the set. Disc 5 has B-Sides and some unreleased songs. The Unreleased songs are mostly from the Achtung Baby sessions. The only one not from the sessions is \\"Even Better Then the Real Thing (Fish out of Water Remix)\\". The unreleased songs are \\"Blow Your House Down\\" a nice rocker, \\"Heaven and Hell\\", a moody song that seems to be Bono riffing with lyrics. \\"Oh Berlin\\" kind of a mid-tempo song that feels like the band felt like they had to write a song about the city in which they were recording. \\"Near the Island\\" a nice little instrumental which has a real Edge/Eno (even though Eno isn't credited) feel to it. \\"Down All The Days\\", this is a really good song that with a little work could have been great. Not sure why it got put away. One of those songs that just builds and builds. Finally there is \\"Everybody Loves A Winner\\" a slower song with Bono mostly singing in falsetto and some nice Edge background vocals. The rest of Disc 4 are previously released B-Sides.  Disc 6-Kindergaten: I'd love to go into a song by song review of just this CD. This is a billed as an early version of Achtung Baby or demos from early songs. It feels more like pieced together bits of demos from each song but that is not a bad thing. Some stick fairly close to the original (Zoo Station, One) and some are almost brand new songs (Even Better Then The Real Thing, Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World). This is a fantastic Disc! It will never replace the original but it is definitely something that will get repeated listens and not just the once over and put away.  The DVD's: The set also includes 4 DVDs. The first is the Documentary \\"From the Sky Down\\". While I really enjoy this documentary it seems to have a problem decided if it is a film about the history of U2 or a film about the making of Achtung Baby. I would have preferred more of the behind the scenes from the making of the album. There is one great part though when Bono and The Edge are listening to some of the original sessions a certain song suddenly morphs into another and a huge light bulb goes off...don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it but it is one of the best moments caught on tape of the birth of a song.   DVD 2 is a collection of the music videos from Achtung Baby and Zooropa. Some are better then others but it's nice to have them all.  DVD 3 has quite a bit on it. There is Zoo TV Special. Which is sort of but not quite behind the scenes of the ZooTVtour. Basically the concert intercut with some behind the scenes and some ZooTV news updates and other things. The rest of the DVD is comprised of shorts. There is The MTV show \\"Most Wanted\\" where a fan won a chance to see a U2 show via satellite from his house. It shows some interviews and music videos but is actually a bit boring.  There is also a MTV documentary, U2 on Naked City, and U2 on TV-AM which are all about the same...interview clips, music clips, ZooTV craziness all mashed together. The last documentary is called Trabantland. It's about the small, East German car that is featured in some of the videos and promo photos. It's enjoyable especially after seeing \\"From the Sky Down\\" and how the band used to see these cars abandoned daily because their East German drivers made the pilgrimage to Berlin just as the cars gave out. There is also some CD-Rom content on this disc. Wallpapers, Screensavers, and links to websites.  Disc 4 is the ZooTV live in Sydney Concert. I didn't own the video of this (just the CD) so I was glad to add this to my collection. Concert films aren't my favorite things to watch but this was a really great show with a nice set list. I wish they could have cleaned up the video for this release but that may have something to do with how it was originally shot.  Overall this is a 5 star buy for me. Yes I own a lot of the material already but the new items and the packaging (mainly the book) justify double dipping for this release. I hope this review helped. It's my first music review but I wanted to let people know what to expect from this wonderful set.
0307593312|3.0|I am a fan of Murakami's work and this is certainly one of his best novels. However, the strange restriction mentioned by many other reviewers baffles and angers me, I hadn't read the reviews before buying the Kindle edition; it was The new Murakami and I wanted it. So then I discovered the idiocy ofr requiring that it be read on only one device. I think I will not buy any more Knopf books and urge other readers to protest this arrogant, greedy policy.
B005ARYEPK|4.0|Just bought this movie for my 11-year-old. I had forgotton about the strong language and the butt scene...not the best choice for her. I loved it and still do but I was 17 when I first saw it. Save this for a more mature or older child!
B004WR125O|5.0|Product is as advertised.  Easily connected to my e3200 Cisco wireless router and does a good job of picking up internet stations.  Sound quality is also very good.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|as worst album in the galaxy... yea, it sounds like reload demo with old man ranting<br />... in fact the songs are even longer than st anger!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I bought a few of these one for myself and a one for each of my sons based on reviews, I'm not that impressed with them. They are small and hard to hold steady and don't seem to put the sharp enough edge on my knife. I do like the diamond file for serrated edges. But I use a sharpening stone to complete my knife edge.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|so ridiculous bought on my ipod touch for a dollar n they want 2.99 for a lazy port to android.... prob why its not on android market!
B005C9YZIW|3.0|There are really few words that can readily add justification on just how beautiful and awe inspiring this groundbreaking series truly is. As wildlife documentaries go, PLANET EARTH sets a standard that most other film production companies can only dream about. It's with this re-release on Blu-Ray that they take it to even a more heightened level by adding extras that will round out the series in a way that a true fan of the program will drool over. My only complaint is that this release quite clearly indicates in it's selling copy above, and on the product's packaging, as well, that this new SPECIAL EDITION features a \\"Music Only\\" viewing option, when it does, in fact, also include SFX over ever music track when in this selected mode. This was a BIG let down for me, I was especially looking forward to experiencing the series again, sans dialogue and SFX. Had this detail been more clearly stated in the sales section on amazon's page, I'd likely have passed on it and have just kept to my original Blu-Ray release. A bit frustrating, but I think that those collectors who would seek out this product thinking that they were going to get something that seemed pretty clear that it would be \\"music Only,\\" and it turned out otherwise, would be more that a bit disappointed. Other than this, it's a great release. My rating only reflects that false advertising. :)

B004259BMM|5.0|Yet another winner from the so-foine Keith Urban. I'm not giving a song-by-song review because music is just so subjective, so personal experience, a song that reaches right in and hits you in your solar plexus might leave someone else going, \\"meh.\\" But having said that, I don't think Keith Urban can put out a bad album. That husky, earnest voice, with just a hint of that Aussie accent peeping through when he sings certain words, his *amazing* guitar skills, the great production... he's the kind of singer that makes you want to buy a high-end stereo system with turntable and then buy his entire catalog on vinyl (because unarguably, the best CD in the world just cannot quite reproduce the richness, the vibrancy, that you get from vinyl). The only thing better than a Keith Urban CD is a Keith Urban concert. One of the few artists I still automatically purchase on CD (and not download from iTunes) because, short of vinyl, I want to hear that voice, that guitar, in its finest glory. An album you can put on repeat and never tire of hearing.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|I am writing reviews about the apps I have, and Shazam is one I will never forget. Shazam finds all of my music. I have tried to identify Spanish songs and it works to! This application is the best program I have ever seen created. I would buy it, but I got it on the day it was free on Amazon Marketplace.
B00009L1OB|5.0|I had this on cassette. I love it. It came quickly and in mint condition. (I need four more words.)
B0054JELS4|5.0|Little need to be said about this item because I think everybody likes NCIS. Good price and received the item very quick. If u haven't ever watched this show give it a try!!
0470449748|3.0|Its a good starter book. I wish it had more detailed steps for the math portion. Solid reading and reading comprehension. Great service and fast delivery from seller.
B005FVA63A|5.0|This is absolutely amazing, I love it! It is a wonderful collection (though I already own 90% of the material), and a piece of history that all U2 collectors MUST HAVE. When this set fully blossoms, it will surely take up an entire wall to display. Beautiful, over-the-top, and absolutely perfect in every way!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|After lots of reading of reviews I had decided to buy the Documents to Go for my samsung galaxy tab. I paid fifteen dollars for it. It was ok. The one time this app was for free I decided to see it out of curiosity. It is so much better than the fifteen-dollar Documents to go. The layout is very user friendly. I guess my review will be a little bit of a comparison between both. In documents to go, there is a window that you need to click so that you can find a function to edit a word document. if you want to type, you cannot just press anywhere on the screen and start typing. You have to hold your finger touching the screen for a few seconds, then press toggle keyboard and so on. Very complicated ordeal. In Office Suite everything is so much easier. You can just click anywhere and your keyboards pops up.The editing options, the most important ones, are in full view without disturbing your writing ability. They are neatly arranged above the keyboard and using them is much much easier than editing in Documents to go. I would recommend this app over any other one for document viewing and editing.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This movie is not funny.  It's not smart, it's lame, super cheesy hollywood crap.  It has a few funny parts but it's just fluffy stupid humor.
B001JJY3CW|1.0|My title says it all, they churn out the same awful songs every year. Why would anyone listen to this garbage? Please, I really want an answer. A real answer.
0316010669|3.0|Well I think books like these are easy to read, easy to grasp, easy to relate to and somewhat easy to digest. This probably explains its massive popularity. However as some of the other reviewers have rightly mentioned that there's not much of an insight or new findings presented. It's just anecdotes, events, encounters and happenings of rather random nature but presented in a way that really invokes interest.
0857685627|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo28KUCPMS8BZ4R]]When I first realise that another Halo art book is coming out, I was wondering what they are going to put inside.<br /><br />Turns out this art book is sort of a look back at Halo from the art. That's looking back at 10 years of Halo, which really needs a few books to be comprehensive. So this book tries to cover in its 192 pages, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo: ODST, Halo: Wars, Halo: Legends and Halo: Reach. Seven titles if you're counting.<br /><br />The art is grouped in chapters that look at the environment, the enemies, vehicles, alien beings, the good guys, Master Chief and homeworlds.<br /><br />The art is beautiful. There are sketches and also huge paintings. Some are development art, some made it to final. Selected bits are featured so you only get snippets of information, bits and pieces of the whole Halo story. There isn't much duplication compared to other art books because the book shows new art and is made up of stuff that were left out in other books.<br /><br />Because of the immense scope of Halo, this book is a bit underwhelming even though the art is spectacular. Something in my mind keeps telling me there's more. If you've seen [[ASIN:0756655498 Halo Encyclopedia]], you know that there's a whole lot more.<br /><br />If you want to check out more Halo art, you can look for [[ASIN:0345475860 The Art of Halo: Creating A Virtual World]], [[ASIN:0761560726 The Art of Halo 3: Prima Official Art Book]] (incredibly rare), [[ASIN:0744012333 Halo: Reach Legendary Edition Guide (Brady Games  Cover image may Vary)]] (art section at the back) and Halo Encyclopedia (the ultimate reference).<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|A great sequel to a great classic. Honestly I haven't yet opened it, but that's because I already know what I have. Though Dorthy has gotten smaller, she just as quick thinking as she ever was. And she'll need it, dealing with all sorts of characters, as the wheelers, the Army of Oz, Jack, and a new witch who isn't quite the witch you'd expected. If your a fan of the original Oz, this is one not to miss!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|why don't people in washington view this film. in order to stop the runaway bonus's.  i worked for 54 long hard years,and i have not reached 2 million dollars. yet these people can work a bank for a few years and receive 33 plus million. then go to work for the federal government,and receive all the benefits such as medical, dental, prescriptions. while on the inside change the laws to benefit themselves and their freinds on wall street. matt damon should send a copy to every politician in washington.  this a great informative film.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I'm a big fan of yes. The Yes Album,Fragile,Close to the Edge, Tales from Topographic Oceans, Relayer, Going for the One. All top rate five star albums in my opinion. Tormato and Drama were pretty awesome. But from 1984 on they went completely downhill in my opinion. I don't like any of the Rabin yes, any of the 90's yes, or even Magnification. There are good moments here and there, but for the most part what made yes so great was gone. Instead it was cheesy shallow radio pop. I have huge respect for Jon Anderson for being in Yes and for Olias of Sunhillow, but I think his leaving Yes was a beneficial thing for the bands song writing. This is the best album since Drama. This is more like art as opposed to cheesy pop. I really appreciate the flying theme. What keeps this from being a five star is that it would've been nice if Benoit had been more adventurous with his voice. Also \\"The man you always wanted me to be\\" is kind of out of place. I don't really like it. But this CD is good. I really like it.
1451648537|5.0|Even though I acknowledged much information in this book from different resources, I still enjoyed the book ,it's worth reading through from the begining to the end. I like the way how Walter told stories. However, if you goal is to seek more dramas about Steve Jobs and Apple, you would be disappointed at some points. Nothing new will satisfy people's curiosities.
B0053YEM7U|5.0|Have listened, followed and seen YES for 30 years.  This album is it!  Great Review by ProgNerd I can't type that much!  Awesome album.
B003BKF696|4.0|This great album makes me wonder what it would sound like if it hadn't been clipped and horribly recorded to keep up with the curent \\"loudness wars.\\" Even though I tend to listen to all of the songs in one sitting, as others have mentioned, by the end my ears are so worn out from the poor sound that I have to sit in a quiet room for a while before I feel like hearing any other music. I have great AKG 701 headphones that only clarify the mush of this recording.  If only artists would listen to older music and realize that they don't have to distort their music so much that it's unlistenable to get a good, loud, rock CD. I can't wait for this trend to end. Hopefully one day soon most bands will have the courage to say they want their music to be heard as pristinely well as current technology will allow.  Will someone please start the trend?
B005EYP8PO|3.0|I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. The orignal release of Achtung Baby in my eyes is a 5 star CD. The Question here is the remaster and So called bonus material and packeging worth buying a cd twice. In this case as most U2 Fans we have searched the earh for these bonus tracks and payed about 10 bucks a song on Import singles. Back before you could find anything by pot luck on the internet, thus deeming all the singles worthless. So here we are with a bunch of singles/B sides that cost us 3-400 bucks avalible for nothing. I find it quite the insult. Its time for Mr. Bono to stop unloading our money on Africa and tha Dali Lama and give it back to the fans who cant even buy a ticket to a U2 Show at a million bucks a POP(MART). America made you the richest men on earth. Throw it back our way. \\"Outside It's America\\"  \\"America

B002OG5GT8|5.0|If you're looking for a portable amp that will not break your bank and get the best bang for your bucks!!! You already found the right product. The Fiio E5. It's comparable to the $100+ amps out there but why spend that amount when you can get it for $20. Right?  This thing just work... You can never go wrong spending $20for a new toy that you will enjoy and just in case it breaks. It's not heavy on the pocket. It's just $20. So far I'd been using this everday for 4 months. It's still working fine.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Received as a new packaged product.  All DVD's worked with no problem and the BLU-Ray experience is great.  Highly preferred over a basic DVD.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Although Lalo Schifrin's grim, downbeat main theme is not as cheekily catchy as Tom Scott's theme for seasons two and four, the show is still a hoot to watch. From the get-go, the ensemble cast blends perfectly, and the opening credits are a riot.  The opening credits are hilarious because, although the show is called Starsky & Hutch, the guy who plays Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and drives the flashy red and white-striped Ford Gran Torino is the second actor listed. David Soul (Hutch) gets top billing, and over a freeze frame of him yelling and flailing his arms maniacally.  Antonio Fargas, who plays nightclub-owning street informant Huggy Bear, gets special standout billing (\\"and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear\\"). But then, all of a sudden, the credits list Bernie Hamilton (the irascible but lovable Captain Dobey). That's it - just Bernie Hamilton. It's like the credits are saying, \\"...and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear - oh, by the way, Bernie Hamilton.\\"  There's more to the show than just the hilarious opening credits, and certainly much more than the insipid, shallow, and unworthy big-screen Starsky & Hutch parody starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Stiller and Wilson may be funny (not really), but they're no David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser. Soul and Glaser are solid actors with great screen chemistry, and Glaser is a better and more accomplished film and television director.  Even if you're not into TV cop shows or don't particularly care for Starsky & Hutch, at least just check out the opening credits. It's one of the more entertaining highlights of classic 1970s television.
1451629184|3.0|What a tale of courage and I applaud Jaycee for her tremendous amount strength. I saw how a lot of people have complained that a majority of the book focuses on her relationship with her pets. However, that being said they were her constant companions and the other the only things she could trust and rely on. Reading her feelings towards Philip is interesting, and while she does share some of her intimate experiences with him, it is not the purpose of the book to dwell on those moments. If you want to read it for the nasty details, this book is not for you. Her feelings are very raw here, she is not an educated writer, but Jaycee the speaker of the story has heart. She tells you what books are meant to...a story...and one with a happy ending.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|It was great fun for the first try then I put it down,  it just had no lasting entertainment power to it.
044024238X|2.0|I love the stories of Sophie Kinsella and her characters! However, this book was not my favorite. I agree with the other readers saying the situations are very unrealistic. And I believe that she made the main character a bit like Amelia Bedila in that she has no common sense when it comes to some well known domestic tasks. The ending does drag on, but if you are looking for a quick paper back read, this one is for you!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|After that,  very boring,  like I said.  For kids Especially since it's not a violent game,  and it's a good design.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a Junior High Math teacher I was wonder what all the hype was about this book. I read it and now I know. It was thrilling, memorable and intriguing. The characters are all unique yet fit well together. I quickly down loaded the 2nd book of the series after reading the first.
0446547654|5.0|I loved this story, Sparks' stories all always so real, I can already see a movie coming!!! Tuck was so amazing and really tugged at my heart, what a character.
0307593312|5.0|This Review is for the Book and not the DRM on the book. For those that are looking at the rating and wondering what in heaven's name is going on. Well some people are making one star reviews for the ebook rights and how they are able to read it on their device. Which is totally wrong and I wanted to point that out.  I am a fan of Haruki Murakami and this book will not disappoint.

0452284392|5.0|This book describes fairly old work done toward the end of the twentieth century.  However, as I had not heard of it before, I found it to be interesting.  Prof. Barabasi's group was able to carry out some very nice experiments in statistical mechanics on the internet and World Wide Web, thanks to a very talented programmer.  This represented, at the time, an indicator of the possibility for developing a science of complex systems in the twenty-first century.  Prof. Barabasi points to the work of Erdos and Renyi as a progenitor.<br /><br />Although much work was done in this area theoretically prior to the work of Erdos and Renyi on random graphs, their work was essentially the seminal piece of work.  This is interesting because, at the same time in physics, one had the extensive work on critical phenomena being done somewhat prior to the appearance of the renormalization group theory on the scene.  However, their work would have been characterized as \\"percolation theory\\" in physics, an area that was not very well appreciated at that time.  Therefore, even if physicists had been aware of this mathematical work, I am not sure they would have appreciated its significance.  A field theorist, in physics, in fact, would have been very dismissive, in all likelihood, due to the fact that this would have been characterized as \\"only\\" zero-dimensional field theory.<br /><br />In any case, workers in complex systems began to take up the scientific investigation of real networks, and the work on random graphs took on a new coloring, as it was realized that real networks did not seem to obey the properties of a random graph delineated by Erdos and Renyi and other graph theorists.  With the discovery of power laws in these networks, it was recognized that one is dealing with randomness, but not in a static sense, as in graph theory.  Real networks embedded in two or three dimensions evolve in time.  At first, only growth processes in such networks were considered and the \\"scale free\\" theory developed by Prof. Barabasi and others resulted:  The first breakthrough (and a very significant one) in understanding.<br /><br />At the time that this book was written, scientists were taking more sophisticated viewpoints into account.  For example, the fact that vertices and edges are both \\"created\\" and \\"destroyed\\" in real networks led to considerations such as the appearance of modular structure in networks as they evolve.<br /><br />This book describes some of the most exciting work being done at the turn of the century in statistical mechanics and complex systems.  It seems to suggest that the twenty-first century will see much progress in the area of complex networks, with perhaps significant technological applications.  It is a very exciting book to read, despite being a little old, and I can certainly recommend it.ree\\" theory developed by Prof. Barabasi and others resulted:  The first breakthrough (and a very significant one) in understanding.<br /><br />At the time that this book was written, scientists were taking more sophisticated viewpoints into account.

B005FVA63A|5.0|I am a huge U2 fan, and this was a must have for me.  Yes, it is very expensive.  But as a collector of U2 collectibles, I had to own this piece and I was not disappointed.  From the all the vinyls to the CDs and videos to the Bono Fly shades, this is a fantastic set.  If you are a casual fan, getting the album deluxe is would be great too.  Achthung is a classic album that defines U2. If you're a huge fan, but don't want to spend that much, the super deluxe is awesome as well.  I was willing to spend the extra, and I feel it was worth it.  No regrets.  Also, and this may be the case with the super deluxe as well, the uber deluxe set comes with a digital code to allow you to download all the music content from this set online, which is nice so I won't wear out the CDs.  I have not done this yet to make sure all the content within the box is available digitally.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This is an excellent movie, mostly from a child's perspective.  It portrays the innocence of humanity and the evil that existed during the Holocaust.  This is an appropriate movie as well with no cussing or nudity, and the violence is seen however the viewer still knows what is happening.  I watched this with my children (9 & 10) and it was a good way to introduce the Holocaust without them seeing the extreme violence.

B005FVA3LK|1.0|When U2 released Achtung Baby in 1991, it was their first album in the decade, and the follow up to the somewhat flop of \\"Rattle And Hum.\\" This is my favorite U2 album by far. The CD doesn't really sound remastered, only louder. It was a full digital recording to begin with, so perhaps there wasn't that much to do. Including a disc of demos of the album was a great idea, however, some of the tracks sound like 2011 Bono singing to 1991 U2 playing. This is a shame. If the tracks did not have vocals, simply release them as they are. Why only One Star??? The music deserves around 400 stars, but U2's Management released a statement basically calling it a cash grab. 6 CDs and 4 DVDs sound great. This set was not made for the casual U2 fan. The Casual U2 fan is not about to plunk down $126 for a Box Set. The problem, is that hard core fans like me were horrified to find out that the Zoo TV DVD Live In Sydney was part of this set. This is something Die Hard fans already paid for. More than Once. We bought it on VHS, some bought it on the old Laser Disc format, then on DVD. They could have chopped off $10 or so on the price, and not make us buy the same thing twice. I can't give the band a free pass on this one. They have so much money, they have to understand that their die hard fans who want the box set are going through tough economic times. This set is better than Sting's latest Box Set that is a total rip off. I still have to rate the set with one star, as this band goes to much trouble to market themselves as philanthropists, and now they are robbing their own fans.   The demo Cd is the reason to buy the box. It is great hearing the songs as they probably were before the final album. Like I said, some of the songs sound doctored up a bit after the fact. A lot of artists do this, so I guess I'll have to deal with it. I have not watched the entire doucmentary DVD yet, however, it is very good, and a big positive when considering if  to purchase this. Again, the failure of U2's Manager Paul McGuinness to understand their die hard fans is hard for me to   take. I've spent thousands of dollars on this band, and figure they couuld've dropped the Sydney DVD, and given us a unreleased  concert from the same period, so that we don't have to give our money to bootleggers who charge $35 or more for a poor quality   release.   One last complaint, is that there were a lot of unused songs from both the Achtung Baby, and Zooropa era which did not make the cut. I really could do without all the remixes, as I own all the CD singles as well, like most Die Hard U2 fans do. They   easily could've made it 7 CDs and taken out the Sydney DVD, with or without another concert.   Still, most die hards will have to buy this, warts and all. It's just with somebody like Bono, you would think  he would have the understanding that including the Sydney DVD was a slap in the face to the real fans. I won't be lisening to \\"Scarelt\\" from October tonight, and will not be singing \\"Rejoice.\\" Shame On You, U2.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|The CD is absolutely perfect. If you are a fan of the first, you need to pick this up as soon as possible.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|This review pertains to the \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" which includes six audio CDs, four video DVDs, book, and art prints.  My reaction is a bit mixed.  While I'd still give this set four out of five stars, at its price, we have the right to be pickier.  Pros:  1.  The \\"Kindergarten\\" version of Achtung Baby is nothing short of revelatory.  This album was such a complete balance of songwriting and sonics (production) that when the production is changed, the whole album is different.  It's equally shocking to hear \\"One\\" with a loud, obnoxious acoustic guitar as it is to hear \\"So Cruel\\" with most of its final elements already in place.  And in this case, completism is illuminating:  By sequencing every Achtung Baby song in the exact same order, these radically different versions form a completely warped version of the album.  2.  The Achtung Baby/Zooropa B-sides contain some great music, such as the moving \\"Down All the Days\\" (a ballad that uses the rhythm and guitar tracks from \\"Numb\\"!), the apocalyptic \\"Oh Berlin\\", the insane rhythm mash that is \\"Lady with the Spinning Head\\", and even a Philip Glass-esque ambient track from Bono and The Edge's work on the A Clockwork Orange project.  3.  Davis Guggenheim's documentary, From the Sky Down:  Absolutely stunning.  Seeing all these Rattle and Hum outtakes made me wonder why they had edited the original Rattle and Hum film the way they had.  In From the Sky Down, you'll hear the original jam that had resulted in the writing of \\"One\\" -- hearing the chord progressions in the middle of a raucous, uptempo jam is just shocking.  Tons of behind-the-scenes footage on the sessions, with audio and real interactions, and Guggenheim is exactly the kind of director who lets these moments breathe.  See Rattle and Hum-style footage of Bono throwing a hissy fit after a show because somebody in the concert had missed some kind of cue (\\"You don't need a degree in stagecraft to know what I was trying to do...\\").  And this film had the single most moving U2 film moment I've ever seen:  Bono and wife Ali Hewson dancing in a bar as Bono's voice-over contemplates the Rattle and Hum debacle.  Cons:  1.  The packaging is nice...but the book actually feels like a bulkier, larger-print version of the booklets that had come with the reissues of Boy, October, War and The Unforgettable Fire.  Which, to me, begs the question:  Are we getting anything new other than photography, and for a photography book, isn't this a bit pricey?  2.  The art prints:  Nice, not a big buying incentive.  3.  I had not known that one of the CDs included is Zooropa, the album.  Come on.  Really?  Zooropa is very different from Achtung Baby.  4.  Two CDs worth of Achtung Baby remixes...a bit ho-hum.  Dance remixes were a substantial part of the Achtung Baby musical direction, but how many times can we hear \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\"?  How many dance versions do we need?  5.  I agree with the fans who are dismayed that one of the DVDs is squandered on Zoo TV:  Live from Sydney.  A U2 fan who pays $126 for this edition would already have this.  6.  The Achtung Baby/Zooropa music videos:  Good, with a few classics (the hilarious \\"Numb\\" being the highlight), but again, most of these are already available on previous releases.  It's nice to have all of them on one disc, but most likely you'll be paying for repeats as well.  7.  What I really don't like on this package are the \\"Bonus documentaries\\".  Most of these are promos from the Zoo TV era.  The problem is, most video pieces related to that tour have the exact same style:  Frantic cuts of random imagery, onscreen text.  Watching these documentaries is like watching a Zoo TV show without the band, or like surfing channels for too long.  And you are guaranteed to be sick to death of \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" and \\"Zoo Station\\" at the end of these.  I really think they should have been more judicious with their choice of documentaries (that MTV \\"Most Wanted\\" piece was just painful to endure) and included more offbeat, different pieces like the \\"Trabantland\\" documentary.  A history of Hansa Studios or something about the German reunification, for example.  Is it worth the price?  Personally, I think they could have dropped the price a bit and edited the contents a little more judiciously.  I don't regret the purchase, but I'm not 100 per cent in the positive column, either.

B00006878K|5.0|This album shows perfectly the influence of blues Music on 60's music. Songs by the greatest of Stax songwriters but also Leiber and Stoller rock 'n roll, 40's country blues and even jazz.  Backed by the Stax house band the album stomps and rolls along like the best of them, adding to King's guitar sound that harks back at those before him, and definitely influenced the scores of guitar players in the decades to follow.

B002RL7W9W|4.0|I bought this when it was on sale and the price/pieces came to around $0.15/piece.  Still a little high, but I was very happy with the quality of the figures that came with it.  Two snow troopers, an AT-AT Driver, and an Imperial Officer.  The speeder bike was nice and didn't fall apart.  However, I had some issues with the Battle station.  Since the components are placed on a small flat platform, it became pretty crowded and difficult to maneuver the figures and launch the flick rocket.  A slightly larger platform would have been ideal.  Overall though, I thought what really made the set were the figures.

B005HP2J66|5.0|--------------------------------------------<br />\\"The Cave Of Forgotten Dreams\\"<br />(Directed by Werner Herzog, 2011)<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Given unprecedented access to the Chauvet Cave, a vast archeological repository located in the south of France, legendary director Werner Herzog and a minimal crew of four crawl through tunnels and balance on delicate metal catwalks, filming the extraordinary and breathtaking cave paintings found within. Herzog designed a lightweight, portable 3D camera, small enough to be brought into the cavern, so that he could capture the ways in which the ancient artists of Chauvet used the natural contours of the cave walls to enhance their artwork. Although often rough technically, it is the most meaningful use of 3D cinematography I have ever seen, placing viewers inside the space of the cave in a way that seems magical and unreal.<br /><br />The Chauvet cave paintings were made over 30,000 years ago, depicting predatory animals such as bears and lions, as well as bison, rhinos, mammoths and perhaps most striking of all, a wall of beautifully rendered horses. The spiritual and artistic presence of these paintings is almost overwhelming, embued with primal, primordial history and an astonishing technical and aesthetic command: these pictures are both evocative and beautiful. Herzog approaches them reverently, and delights in their mystery, often shooting them in half-shadow or using moving, flickering light to suggest the rude torches used by their creators as well as the complete, total darkness that shrouded these powerful pictures for untold millennia. Throughout the film he intones in a soft European murmur, musing about the nature of human consciousness and the relationship of this ancient artwork to our own modern sensibilities: how much of the aesthetic and world view of this primitive culture do we carry about with us today? Some viewers may find the intellectualism and pretensions hard to take (as well as the often intrusive but oddly affecting score...) yet it is hard to deny the power of the subject.<br /><br />You or I will never be able to go inside these caves -- they are closely guarded by the French government -- but in Herzog's film we can become immersed in them. Leaving the theater, walking in sunshine or under electric lights, you may marvel at the wonders that thirty thousand years of human life have brought - the works of stone and steel, plastic and glass, the layer upon layer of habitation and roads, the planes in the sky and the optical magic that brings art to life in films such as this. And, like Herzog and his crew, you may find yourself swept up by the connections we still have to the stunning pictures that lay hidden inside a dark cave for far more time than civilization itself... it is truly miraculous.<br /><br />A highly recommended, deeply moving film - for the full effect see it in the theaters, if you can.

B000286RNY|5.0|I'm late to the party but let me jump on that bandwagon anyway. SHAOLIN SOCCER is when Stephen Chow first made big noise, to which he quickly capitalized with the brilliant KUNG FU HUSTLE. And I guess I'll go off on a brief tangent and just call him out for not having done much lately. Dude was already a name in Hong Kong, but SHAOLIN SOCCER is what put him on the world stage.<br /><br />Stephen Chow borrows from Jackie Chan's schtick and improves on it, infusing SHAOLIN SOCCER with broad humor, dazzling martial arts, and even a wacky musical number. It's huge fun, and unlike Jackie's habit of exhibiting clownish expressions, Stephen consistently maintains a deadpan demeanor which I think makes his comedy more effective. Stephen Chow plays \\"Mighty Steel Leg\\" Sing, a scruffy cleaner and post-graduate student whose ambition is to make Shaolin kung fu accessible to the masses. And he regards the game of soccer as the means to achieving this. Under the tutelage of disgraced ex-soccer star Fung a.k.a. \\"Golden Leg,\\" Mighty Steel Leg and his reunited motley band of fellow Shaolin Temple alums parlay their kung fu training onto the soccer field. And while the film takes its sweet time to get these reluctant players on the field, once they do, it generates this exhilarating momentum. You can take or leave Chow's patented cinematic ticks but there's no denying the masterful visual effects that come into play. We get treated to some wildly spectacular sight gags.<br /><br />The story takes time to introduce its characters and their sordidness, and this lends a rooting interest for the viewer. Ultimately, it's Fung who provides the film's emotional anchor, with Stephen Chow wrangling the most showy role. But the most endearing character, for my  money, is the unsvelte Iron Head, played by Wong Yat Fei, an actor who has a way with physical comedy. Vicki Zhao plays the sympathetic role of Mui, the painfully shy girl whose bakery-fu is most excellent and whose tai chi goalie skills are, as we learn, very formidable. But Mui's delectable steam buns are what inspire a musical number.<br /><br />As Mighty Steel Leg goes about recruiting his Shaolin brothers, it's readily apparent that these slovenly blokes have neglected their kung fu. So cue the amusing training montages, all this to prep the team to cut a swath thru national soccer competition and on to a championship showdown with the dreaded Team Evil, a crew what had won the Super Cup five years running and is fueled by (if you're watching the original Chinese version) \\"evil American drugs.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't seen SHAOLIN SOCCER or KUNG FU HUSTLE, you're in for something you've never seen before, something bordering on the surreal. Stephen Chow specializes in offbeat martial arts flights of fancy. I love the little touches he injects, from the goalie (not Mui) clad in the classic yellow Bruce Lee track suit to that little bit that Mui does as the musical number abruptly ends to Mui's hilarious fail which has her reporting to the other team's goal post, to the shame of her teammates. This DVD allows for the option to see the film either in its American version or in the original Chinese version. Except you should see it in the original Chinese version which has a running time of 112 minutes as opposed to the severely edited 87 minutes long American version.

0817439390|5.0|I consider myself a hobbyist.  I have been reading photography magazines, photography websites and photography books for years.  I figured this book wouldn't teach me much new.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Bryan has an infectious writing style that is so much like his video tutorials.  He can use simple items to describe the mathematics of proper exposure.  His book is full of exercises one can do alone to better understand exposure, and there are plenty of examples he uses to show how exposure can vary depending on camera settings.  He knows his stuff and exudes a passion for the art.<br /><br />This book covers more than just aperture, shutter speed and ISO.  Bryan also covers proper lighting, flash, bracketing and HDR photography.  He talks about special gear and what to look for in lighting when shooting photos.  Everything is well-photographed.<br /><br />Although Bryan uses a Nikon DSX, formulas work for all dSLRs.  Once the reader understands all that is needed to better understand exposure, s/he can leave this book on the coffee table for its beautiful photographs, or pass it on to the next camera buff.<br /><br />The photographer will walk away learning something from this book.

The scenes that are visually created  and concept is magical but I kept getting the feeling there was a lot left out and didn't find myself drawn to or caring about any of the characters.  I read the reviews and kept thinking, its going to get better.  It was interesting but not anything I'd ever care to read again.
B003FVI2KQ|3.0|My computer suffered a couple of crashes a day or more. I got to work trying to isolate the problem: I first tested memory and the test would make the computer reboot after a while. So I bought new memory. That did not fix the problem. I removed my video card and used the onboard graphics - to no effect. I then exchanged the motherboard. That didnt do anything either. I got a new power supply, again to no effect. This experimentation happened over the course of 6 months. I finally got a new CPU (the same model) and that fixed it.   I've assembled several dozen computers in my time, but this is the first instability that I've traced to a cpu.  The processor is fast for my purposes - I use it for numerical simulation of imaging systems. It's multi-threaded, and 6 cores makes it run fast. However, the instability cost me way more in terms of my time than the processor's speed saved me.

1594203059|2.0|It is unfortunate that an historian as talented as Ferguson has recently published such shallow books. This is the author afterall who first burst on the scene with incredible works such as his widely acclaimed, two volume history of the Rothchild family, easily one of the finest jobs of deep research I've ever read. And his biography of Siegmund Warburg. THIS is Ferguson's true calling: Books on the history of finance and the people who made that history.  But then he began writing books on subjects  with little depth and few if any new insights. This latest work, with its au courant slogans like 'killer apps', etc smacks of pandering to a junior audience.  This is not how you sustain a reputation as \\"One of the worlds most influential people' as TIME magazine called him some years ago.  Ferguson needs to return to his roots of awesome research, fine writing and penetrating insights if he wants to stand out from the crowd of authors with far less going for them than he has.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Ok, I don't want to look like the guy who just hates on everything for no reason, because well...that is not me. But when it comes to Lulu I think the criticism that comes from Amazon reviewers (including myself) is deserved. Now three years after releasing Death Magnetic (2008), an album that was considered a step in the right direction for Metallica, they release Lulu, a collaboration with Lou Reed. Lulu is really more of a Lou Reed album, it's his ideas, his concept and he approached Metallica play it on it. It's not the follow up to Death Magnetic.To be honest it pretty much sounds like Lou Reed with Metallica backing him up, partly because Lou wrote most of the lyrics. So there it is, it's not a Metallica album but it has the band's name on it and for that reason alone people will expect it to be something it's not. I'm not a fan of Reed's rough old man vocals and they don't mix well with the type of music Metallica plays, both artists don't sound good together. There are some weird and interesting moments on Lulu such as \\"The View\\" and \\"Pumping Blood\\", we even have a faster Metal song with \\"Mistress Dead\\" but it's not enough to save it from criticism. Obviously both artists were excited at the idea of collaborating and creating an album together but from fans' point of view nothing's happening here. Some will say I don't get it and maybe I don't, I'm not claiming to completely understand or even like Reed's concept based around a German play that I have never heard of.<br /><br />I liked Death Magnetic a lot and thought it was their strongest work since the Black Album. But if this album is what was needed for Metallica to step up and release their next great album then so be it. From the second I heard about the Metallica/Reed collaboration I was skeptical and with each clip of music release I knew it would be hard for me to enjoy this album. I can't speak for Lou Reed fans because although I do enjoy some of his past work I cannot claim to be a massive Reed fan but I know that a lot of people buying Lulu are buying as Metallica fans. And I think it's obvious and safe to say that the majority of Metallica fans have been deceived. On the good side (for Metallica that is), they can always claim that this album was an outlet to release creativity in a project other than Metallica and that it isn't a true Metallica album and was never meant to be. 1/5.know that a lot of people buying Lulu are buying as Metallica fans.

0446547654|5.0|I read some of Amazon's reviews before I purchased this book.  I know either way I was going to get it since I just love Nicholas Sparks books.  I have every book he's written so far.  The best of me isn't my #1 favorite but it's definitely top 3 from Sparks work.  Yes, the end is kind of predictable and disappointed in a way as I wish for a different ending.  However the way Sparks told the story, I couldn't stop reading it.  I sacrificed my sleep time and read this book (I have a 11 months old baby so that tells a lot to give up sleep time).  I really enjoyed this book and cried my eyes out from time to time through out the book.  I hope you'll enjoy it as much too!

B001E75QH0|2.0|The original is a classic romp of the most fun sort.  Nothing really compares in cinema history.  Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all, from Ford's stoic Indy portrayal to Allen's flinty sidekick/love interest to a smug Frenchman and a fastidious Englishman and a noble Egyptian, not to mention the most vile collection of evil Nazis ever filmed.  Snakes, planes, ships, traps, narrow escapes, and a seemingly never ending series of fist pumping victories over the bad guys.  After the limp and silly Temple of Doom, Indy roared back with Sean Connery in tow as Indiana's father, for the series' only worthy sequel, as the Jones' scramble to find that which King Arthur's knights could not, the Holy Grail.  Like the first one, this one is non-stop fun and action.  Whatever possessed Lucas and Spielberg to resurrect the franchise for the insulting Crystal Skull is beyond my understanding.  Ford is way too old for the action, so the world's most annoying actor, Shia LeBouef, is inserted as Indy's and Marion's bastard son, and LeBoeuf is relentlessy irritating.  Even Cate Blanchett can't save this mess, and her talent is largely squandered on a two-dimensional character.  Just like the Star Trek films, only the odd numbered ones are worth a damn.  But when they're good, they're great fun and worth repeated watchings on an annual basis.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|The extended version brings the book to life in a way the original release did not.  Scenes that were unconnected now make sense and the original intention of the book comes together. A pity they did not have the funds to avoid some of the repetitions such as the spaceships landing and the use of the story boards in the extended version.

B005J29HCQ|4.0|It's very satisfying to finally have this familiar material in crystal-clear studio master sound, performed with the magical vocal synergy of the original Beach Boys.  Had SMILE been released as a single LP in the '60s (as planned), it probably would have been at least fifteen minutes shorter than the version presented here, and a good editing is exactly what this collection needs. As it stands, the 48-minute assembly on Disc 1 (from \\"Our Prayer\\" to \\"Good Vibrations\\") comes across like a monstrous Italian overture, with teasing bits of rhythm and melody echoing \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and foreshadowing the grand finale of \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  Ambitious and brilliantly produced? Obviously, yes. \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\" are undoubtedly two of Brian Wilson's finest songs. But the greatest album of the pop era, as some reviewers breathlessly claim? Sorry. I don't think so. Even after the scissors, SMILE would not eclipse its mighty predecessors, PET SOUNDS, RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER. Like SGT. PEPPER, SMILE is too indulgent, too self-consciously clever for its own good. He was trying too hard. Maybe that's why it collapsed.  Essential listening to anyone interested in Western pop music, though.
B005Q5OLC2|5.0|Months ago I downloaded \\"Brooklyn\\" onto my Kindle, where it sat reproachfully as I bypassed it for other books. I am sorry I did not get to it sooner.<br /><br />It is the story of a very ordinary young woman, Eilis Lacey, who leaves her home in Ireland, where employment is scarce in the post World War II years, to take a job in America. She is the least likely of emigrants, a rather timid homebody, quite inarticulate, with few aspirations, in contrast to her high-spirited sister Rose. However, it is Eilis who makes her way in Brooklyn, to live in a boardinghouse that caters to young Irish women, although she suffers terribly from homesickness.<br /><br />Colm Toibin's skill in conveying both the plainness and the beauty of the life Eilis makes for herself in Brooklyn is compelling. Not much happens to Eilis, yet one feels the dislocations and emptiness of a single immigrant woman in a foreign city. Her return to Ireland near the end of the story and the surprising denouement may put you in mind of the Irish writer William Trevor. The life Eilis lives in Brooklyn, however, also recalls the work of a great chronicler of the American immigrant experience, Henry Roth, whose \\"Call It Sleep\\" is still, to my mind, one of the best American novels.<br /><br />Toibin's Brooklyn is not nearly complete a world as Roth's Lower East Side, but \\"Brooklyn\\" is a fine addition to the body of literature devoted to the American immigrant experience.<br /><br />M. Feldman

B00006RAKP|3.0|Long-time E.J. fans will be very familiar with the first disk of this set - the songs pretty much sum up the first two \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums John has put out.  I'll probably just download a few of the songs from the second disc.  Y waste good money in today's economy?
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|Not sure where all the vitriol for this album is coming from or what people expected. Firstly, I am a casual Lou Reed fan (I like the VU and some of his solo work) and I am not a fan of Metallica (they seem like poseurs to me). But this album should be judged for what it is: a Lou Reed album with Metallica backing, as has been stated in other reviews. As such, it's strangeness in terms of music and lyrics is all Reed. It really is more of an avant garde work, which should be no surprise since it comes from Reed. Is the repetitiveness of the first track much different from that of \\"Strawman\\" from his album New York? His vocals are not as bad as others say. The recording is good and the guitars and drums have some heavy impact. ts out sounding exactly like Metallica, but then goes back to Lou's seemingly random lyrics. The albums suffers primarily from being too long and self-indulgent, but it is not the worst thing ever recorded, and certainly no worse than some of Reed's other output. I think people wanted more conventional song structure, more melody and less bizarre lyrics, but for my taste, I don't mind a challenging listen.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|The best book ever hands down.  Ayn Rand is the best author that has ever existed.  Although, I am not usually a fan of fiction this book offers the best of both worlds.

0375826726|3.0|I've enjoyed the inheritance trilogy, um I mean cycle, thus far, but Brisngr is the weakest in the series. Brisngr mostly suffers from the mistakes of Eragon in the first two books in that we must now have Eragon follow up on every oath he made - which was 7.<br /><br />Pros:<br />We learn much more of the overarching story, and we learn more about many of the factions at play in Algaesia. There is a lot of grey added to the story, and everyone from the Varden to Urgals are cast in a different light. Eragon himself starts to question his \\"right\\" to attack Galbatorix, and has to come up with his own moral for the devastation that he is sure to bring to innocents.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The story was forced by the earlier mistakes of Eragon, and suffered a bit from \\"let's move things along\\" that can so often plague a series.<br />Is Eragon always going to get his way? Some of the changes in Eragon's favor (i.e. the sword) seriously compromise other characters' standards; which I disliked.<br />It's quite violent for the reading level, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. I don't mind violence in a book (I really enjoyed the dragon tatoo series) but I do mind when a series is geared towards young readers and then sprinkles in vividly described violence. The story line is for older teenagers, but the writing level is at a pre-teen level. Either up the reading level or gloss over the violence please.<br />I think the biggest flaw of the book is Eragon's age. He's just too young for this story, and his lack of maturity seriously dampens the story's potential. I know he was \\"thrown-in\\" to this mess, but I honestly think that warring factions would have taken the smarter road of hiding Eragon until he grew up (faking his death comes to mind) instead of risking everything they have been fighting for on the off chance that a 16 year old farm boy is ready to fight the evil king.<br /><br />Summary:<br />An interesting read with great potential, but the main character is too flawed for the series to be truly great.

0307887898|5.0|I've been with several startup tech companies as an employee, officer, investor, or board member. (And I continue to do so.) I've also been an executive at the world's biggest software company.  In my years I've seen people's time, money, work, and heart burned up trying to make startups look like mature companies: formulating complicated plans, throwing massive resources at them, and then finding in 12-18 months what didn't work, because startups run on speculative ideas.  Yet I've also seen other startups burn up their resources pursuing ideas that were just untested speculation -- jumping in and chasing a dream without justification.  Mr. Ries is not a thrilling writer, but more importantly, he is right. His is the first book I've seen that usefully captures and explains how a high-innovation startup should work: setting up immediate learning opportunities and very fast feedback cycles, so as to figure out the new business's winning formula.   His easy-to-read book is full of practical insight that will push aside the inappropriate mature-company management plans or wild-goose chases that can be so harmful to startup executives and investors. And he explains with clear examples as well as more general principles.  I will be recommending his book to people whose companies I invest in.

B001HN6922|1.0|When I take my kids to movies, I want us to be entertained, PERIOD!  I do not go to Pixar movies to be informed or enlightened.  I want a plain vanilla movie that is fun for the family.  What I don't want is what Cars 2 attempts to dish out:  Another movie trying to exploit \\"Big Oil\\".  It really makes me want to puke!  Just what is Lightning McQueen?  A race car, not a golf cart.  And the villain in this movie?  A character who will profit from \\"Big Oil\\".  The very first scene is hundreds of oil platforms with smoking flares.  Give me a break!  What is ironic is that Pixar's DVD is made from polycarbonate. Most polycarbonates of commercial interest are derived from rigid monomers, which come from.... wait for it... crude oil.  Oh My God!  I could quit my job and march on Wall Street!
B003L77G2Y|4.0|By far the better season in the series,with the story reaching more conclusions,but.just saw some promos for season 4 and it looks like more questions for the veiwer,,,,
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I was really excited about getting this deluxe edition, even though I already have most of the content, because Achtung Baby is, for me, an absolutely perfect album and my favorite ever.  The first four CDs weren't anything special for me, since I already own Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and most of the remixes from the Uber and Unter discs (and I'm not that crazy about remixes in general anyway).  The 5th disc I was originally disappointed in, because some of the songs clearly have vocals that were recorded recently; the difference in Bono's voice quality and range is obvious.  However, it does call itself \\"B-Sides and Bonus Tracks,\\" so I'm okay with just telling myself that these are the \\"bonus tracks\\" and it's fine if they're recent.  I haven't gotten all the way through this disc yet, so I'm not sure how much of the material I already own (looks like most but not all), but I'm still happy to have these songs with decent sound quality.  The 6th disc, \\"Kindergarten - the alternative Achtung Baby\\" is awesome.  It was actually what I popped in first, while I was still perusing the book.  I love hearing where these great songs came from and other directions they could have taken, although none are as good as the album versions in my opinion.  It's a perfect record, how could they make these songs better?)  I've only watched the first of the DVD discs so far, and I loved \\"From the Sky Down.\\"  I've read Bill Flanagan's book \\"U2 at the End of the World\\" many times, and I'm glad they didn't gloss over the importance of \\"One\\" in really saving the band.  My only small complaint with the film was that it might be difficult for viewers who don't know the band members' voices well to tell who was speaking, and at times it was important to know who it was.  I didn't have any problems, but a casual viewer might.  I already have the ZooTV Live from Sydney DVD, and I sort of wish they had been able to put in DVD of a different show from the tour (Like Live From Dublin in August of '93,maybe--even a high quality soundboard audio recording, which does exist, of this show would have improved the newness of the material), although I doubt many were filmed in enough detail back in those days.    The book is great; mostly images with a few sections of writing from people who know details about the album.  I would have appreciated more words added, but again, I guess that's what Bill Flanagan's book is for.  I'm really glad I bought this, and for me it was worth the money, but I do wish there were more things included that the die-hard fan wouldn't already have in their collection.

0671510991|5.0|This book is written on a subject about which the author is an expert. In this book, you get a historical review of America's foreign policy and why it evolved over time. All of this is written from the eyes of a master of the trade. Kissinger's grasp of history and his knowledge of government's actions makes this a book that is theoretical, but also practical. This is a very rare treat within political science. The book is also a real treat because it sheds light on how to advance American interests in an uncertain world, although this is a little bit dated.  All in all, a very informative book that draws from practical insight to inform and educate.
0618680004|2.0|I'm an agnostic-atheist, and a fan of Dawkins early work, but this book badly misses the mark.    Dawkins would have us believe religion is the #1 problem (or root of problems) in the world, when it reality it's probably not in the top 10.  World leaders certainly don't make decisions based on religion, nor do the vast majority of average people.    Unlike \\"The Selfish Gene\\", which anyone can benefit from, I'm left wondering if there's anything to be gained from \\"The God Delusion\\".
0553386794|5.0|I have only introduced myself to the fantasy genre. What I have found is that there is a tendency for most writers to write stories in which the hero always wins, and the bad guys get killed. This leads to a pretty formulaic approach to writing these books. Well, this is not what you will find in this book. IN this book you will see some of the good guys get the axe, and some of the bad guys be successful. This creates a different type of story, and one that is filled with action and excitement. Get it and enjoy!!!
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|This is defiantly the best offering Megadeth has had in the last decade. Longtime fans of Megadeth will love the fast paced guitar riffs, solos, and everything you love about 80's Megadeth albums. What Th1rt3en does better than Endgame is the album never slows down and is always a thrashing good time. I already loved the demo versions of \\"Black Swan\\", \\"Millennium of the Blind\\" and \\"New World Order\\" and they came out superb. If this is to be Megadeth's final album, I am proud to say they went out on one hell of a high note!   DAVE MUSTAINE FOR PRESIDENT!  Best Songs:  -Th1rt3en  -Deadly Nightshade   -Millennium of the Blind
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I'm not one of those fans who thinks that Bjork's best music is behind her. In fact, I'm in the camp that believes her musical output just keeps getting better and better. I applaud experimentalism and taking risks, which defines Bjork's entire career beginning with Debut. Despite her continuous evolution as an artist, people tend to separate her career into two phases. Basically everything post-Vespertine is considered phase two. I, on the other hand, see a natural progression from one album to the next without regard to this notion that Bjork abandoned all the artistic elements that defined her first four albums. With that said, I actually wouldn't say that Bjork has broken any new ground on Biophelia relative to her own creative output over the last two decades. Bjork was already toying with similar concepts on Volta in terms of linking music to science and the natural world. I see this album as further exploration of the ideas she was formulating in her mind five years ago. Contrary to some, I actually quite enjoyed Volta, although it seemed to lack some direction; the individual pieces just didn't seem to all fit together as a cohesive whole. With Biophelia, Bjork has created a very focused and refined conceptual masterpiece. At first glance the lyrics may seem straightforward, but as with many of Bjork's songs, they eventually reveal the dualistic devices Bjork has used to perfection over the years; two natural bodies colliding can be a metaphor for two lovers being drawn together. An album which could have been a cold and emotionless commentary about the link between music and science contains an element of humanity in each lyric. The stripped down, almost minimalist approach to the music is a perfect accompaniment to Bjork's unique vocalizations which vacilsate between ethereal and aggressive. It's just a beautiful album that should be considered as one of Bjork's greatest accomplishments.
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball should be required reading for real baseball fans.  Bringing scientific analysis to a game run by the \\"old salts\\" of managers and scouts is intrigue in spades.  I am not a fan of baseball games played (managed) by waiting for a walk or single, then waiting again for a home run.  I like games played by scratching out runs with stolen bases, sacrifices, and squeeze plays.  That's a lot more fun to watch than a big guy blasting the ball into space.  Home runs are over-rated.  But as Billy Bean points out, that isn't playing the percentages.  Never giving up an out by sacrificing.  Never attempting a steal; and waiting for the home run may be the scientific way to maximize wins over a 162 game season. But it sure isn't nearly as much fun to watch.  That said, Michael Lewis has shined a light into the science behind the modern game.  This is a very interesting book.
B005J3IEZQ|3.0|The book was one of the better I have read on Steve Jobs with some good tidbits not previously known.  Steve was a control freak making it difficult to find out what he was really like as a person.  I think the book rambled on a bit too much about the industry which maybe OK for those who aren't familiar with the story, but probably could be condensed to 300 instead of 600 pages without missing too much.  I got the feeling the author was somewhat under the spell of Steve Job's reality distortion and perhaps because he was dying didn't want to get overly negative.  I'd like to know what his first daughter Lisa and her mother really thought of Steve who denied he was her father when he was super rich and they were on welfare.  Or how about his early friends who helped start Apple whom he denied any stock options.  The author never seemed to ask him tough questions about Jobs lack of philanthropy or what he thought of the philanthropic causes Bill Gates is involved in.  I find it very sad the many in America think creating neat products is changing the world, but my prediction in 10 years time, what Steve Jobs did will be mostly forgoten as new products replace the gadgets he helped create.  Many who don't know the man worship Jobs like they did Michael Jackson.  Both were extremely talented in their own way, but were very flawed as human beings.  Their fans overlooked their human flaws because they liked the products Steve Jobs created or the way Michael Jackson sang and danced.  Much easier to worship someone you don't really know.    Steve Jobs may have been a genius business person, but that was about all.  The book seemed to confirm my belief that he never personally invented much but he had an understanding of what new technologies could do and how to put them together such as touch screen and a cell phone or SIRI voice and a phone or a computer with a GUI, or having an easy to use MP3 player and downloading songs for a small fee at a time when the music industryhad a serious problem with piracy.    I believe Steve at best was like the leader of the orchestra who couldn't play an instrument but could recognize talented musicians and get them to play beautiful music together.  At worst he was more like a cult leader who convinced some very smart geeks that they were changing the world by building better products for which he took all the credit for.  There was a very good passage from Jony Ivi who was Steve's best friend at Apple and designed most of the products where he kept records of everything he created because Steve Jobs took credit for most of it.   I think Steve Jobs has some exceptional qualities like extreme passion and energy and the ability to persuade others that were the keys to his success.  He also seemed to have a great vision of what people would like in a product without doing any market research.  My guess is he figured out what he would like and assumed everyone else would feel the same and he was right most of the time.  He pushed his people to perform to perfection in a way few other CEO's would so they would make products lighter, smaller, faster, easier to use.  His faults were extreme selfishness, lack of empathy for others, dishonesty, and lack of philanthropy.  If he really wanted to change the world, I wish he  would have used his talents doing the things the Bill Gates foundation is trying to do instead of making better consumer electronic gadgets for rich westerners.
B005ER6SNM|3.0|I heard about this film while standing in line at Human Centipede II. During those conversations, people were claiming how horrible it was. Now, without giving too much away anybody that knows a bit about this film already knows of the awful, vile subject matter so I don't think I need to go into deep detail on any of that.  I will say this, there are some that are making this out to be a film that is so terrible that you throw up, need a shower, whatever....and I admit maybe I'm a bit jaded from YEARS worth of shock cinema...Cannibal Holocaust, Salo, Necromantik's, Aftermath, Singapore Sling, Taxidermia, HC...etc...BUT...although the film's subject matter is vile, it's in no way to the level of how people often claim it to be.  NOW...I'm fairly certain I saw an edited copy, it's the 103 minute version of the DVD that is offered for sale. I can tell where the edits take place, for sure 2 scenes in particular, maybe a third. Bewteen all three...at MOST there can only be seconds missing, I'd guess less than a minute total. And to be quite honest, I myself did not need those few seconds back in to get the point of every scene, I'm sure the missing footage is quite awful, but I can pretty well imagine what it was and really will not go out of my way to find an unedtited copy as I do not think it will change the film  to any degree for me as a viewer.   There is no doubt there are underlying political statements in the film and they are quite blatent when setting them up, I got it and I think most that are not so wrapped up in the degenerate sex related aspects will get it too.   The film is well written, well directed with great photography and excellent acting. The problem I had with the film was the totally fake male anatomy appendages, for whatever reason, they chose to utilize what looked like 14in appendages when a 7 or 8in one would have been more realistic. Some of the scenes with those things are absolutely absurd and laughable. It totally took away from the seriousness of the scenes...and who knows...maybe that's what the director was going for.  Some of the things in the film have been done before, the machete scene in particular was done to a very similar degree in Necromantik II and in Hatchet II in a slightly different way.   All in all the film is a pretty decent shock fest, but I just did not have the same reaction many claim to be having, now I admit that may be due to the edited scenes, but I highly doubt it. In relation to vile sexual horror I myself still found \\"Irreversable\\" to be worse IMHO.   Worth a look, but be leary if you are looking for the ultimate in gross out horror....for that I'd say take a look at Human Centipede II.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|Give this CD a try and the reviewers that wrote their recent reviews that were negative used inappropriate words and thoughts.  I think it is terrible that Amazon allows you to write such cruel stuff and using this forum to trash talk Justin Beiber.  Did you really listen to the CD?  You should have seen and heard Justin's performance live with Boys II Men tonight on \\"Dancing with the Stars.\\"  This is a holiday CD that will bring magic to you rather than the same old carols you hear on the radio or in a department store.  A nice spin on the tunes that are old standbys.  I especially like the track with Usher.  Enjoy the CD this season and have fun.  It is the season to be merry and not mean.

B005CW5E3O|5.0|Naming your album ROOTS pretty much gives the listener an idea in advance that what he or she may be getting is some of the \\"stuff\\" that the artist was influenced by as he/she was forming their own sound. Johnny Winter, I always thought was someone GOD HIMSELF put here, and he was a direct link to the John Lee's, the Muddy's, The Howlin' Wolf's, and I could go on and on. But he's NOT a DIRECT link, there was a \\"missing link\\" (no pun intended\\") of music in between those I mentioned and Johnny. He's just so ULTIMATELY TALENTED, that you assume there was nothing in between them and him. If someone told me Robert Johnson met Johnny Winter at that Ol' Crossroads and gave him his git, this would surprise me NOT ONE BIT! On to Roots. Every song on here has at least one guest, and they do an EXCELLENT job! I got the vinyl, not that it really matters, so side 1 starts with T-Bone Shuffle with Sonny Landreth. Excellent jam with both slide players showin' off his mad skills. Further On Up The Road follows with Jimmy Vivino from Conan O'Brien's Basic Cable Band, and he really rocks it. Does a great job. Great song done proud! Next up is Done Somebody Wrong with Warren Haynes, one of my favorites, a guy who can play with ANYONE and either just add some nice subtly played pieces to enhance the song, or add something MORE. Something so, so, so much MORE, TO WHERE WARREN MAKES THE SONG GO! The man is brilliant. Next up is Got My Mojo Working, it's NOT Johnny's song, but it should be! After that is Last Night with some great harp blowin' by Big John Popper, and side A ends with Vince Gill just nailin' Maybellene. Awesome job by Big Vince on an awesome song. Side B starts with Susan Tedeschi adding her Angelic voice AND guitar playing to Bright Lights, Big City. She really does have a voice like an angel it is just so pretty. Honky Tonk follows that with Brother Edgar adding to that one, and then it's one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE SLIDE BLUES SONGS PLAYED BY ONE OF THE GREATEST SLIDE PLAYER TO EVER PICK UP A CORICIDIN BOTTLE. I'm speaking of course of Derek Trucks.   The Late, Great, Elmore James James my have wrote Dust My Broom, but Derek could play it every night and it would only make my day better! Short Fat Frannie with Paul Nelson and Come Back Baby with John Medeski finish off the last two songs on Side B. Overall, a tremendous album. I'm really enjoying it. Johnny is NOT a well Man healthwise. When I saw him at The Crossroads Festival in Chicago in 2010 he needed help getting out to the stage. It could have been the heat, it was over 100 and humid too. But when he's healthy, Man, Johnny The Man can STILL bring it! Buy ROOTS. You won't be sorry. You'll be really, really happy actually!

B004T5R2HQ|4.0|So far this is working great and the images interface with my organization software (Neato) on my Mac. I can teather my phone by cable or air and boom! it scans the CamScanner files and and makes it so I do not lose another reciept, invoice, momento, or letter.
B0051OJG4Q|1.0|Beware: Discs one and two are the same, despite the track listing. So instead of getting eight albums, I got six. Thanks a lot.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|Fist off I will say that I am a massive Oasis fan. I respect Noel and his songwriting abilities as much as any great writer in the genre. He is missed a little on this album I must admit, but this is a great offering from the rest of the boys. The tracks all have a great classic Lennon meets Stones sound which makes it worth the purchase. It also made me smile that one of the tracks is named after my two favorite bands. While this isn't as solid as some previous Oasis albums it is still top notch. I will listen to Noel's album in the next few weeks to compare.
1451648537|5.0|This is my first review and would say that this book is enthralling. It took me close to 6 days to read this entire book and I would say this book was totally inspiring to its core. Being a great fan of Steve jobs it was good to know his life, his passion to create insanely great products, work ethics , perfectionism, demons , desires ,artistry,devilry, and obsession for control. This book can only help someone grow in his life by following some of his good qualities. I would say RIP... true genius.
B00144VBBS|5.0|A great, great album.  I have always liked TK's music from the beginning.  This album was an incredible find - it really helped in passing the time and keeping my attention to the traffic while travelling.  My wife really liked the album, also.  Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was really captivated by Hunger Games, this sequel is pretty fun but not quite as captivating as the original.
B004RRVHCW|4.0|Thurston Moore without the guitar squall and diffident vocal swagger is, essentially, lovely.  He's approached his last couple solo albums with a very different poetic sensibility that doesn't leave his unique talent for the guitar behind -- but it does calm the sonics down into the soothing range, and it casts a different eye to the arrangements.  More of a Joe Boyd approach, with harps and strings, instead of his familiar language of guitar happenstance: distortion and pick slides and string-bending placed with a working knowledge of chaos.<br /><br />\\"Demolished Thoughts\\" is the quietest and most meditative yet.  There is no doubt that Beck Hansen's canny ear for pop played an important part in the sessions that produced this album (the man is one of the chief authors of the modern pop sensibility after all), and where massed acoustic sounds dominated \\"Trees Outside The Academy,\\" here openness is the chief instrument.  There's more space in these songs than in anything Moore has done before, outside of minimal experiments like \\"Lost To The City/Noise To Nowhere\\" (but even that was a different style of openness).  Here the instruments and Moore's voice interact more with a carefully maintained silence than with each other.  The arrangements don't really fill out or smack of an overt producer's hand very often at all. What that is, is sensitivity, rather than an absence of production.  More and Hansen have rightly realized that these songs are lighter than air, and they haven't overburdened them with studio technique or extra instrumentation.  There are some flourishes -- a little delay here, a gliss there, a few bars of whistling -- but for the most part the songs shine through.  And they do, almost literally, shine.<br /><br />While all that sounds fine, \\"Demolished Thoughts\\" is actually a difficult album to articulate.  It has some of the frailty of Nick Drake's later work, and even a hint of Hansen's \\"Sea Change.\\"  It's something Robbie Basho or Michael Chapman would be proud to record.  It has more than a little spirituality to it, whether that's just a belief in human potential or bits of Eastern thought worked into the musical weave.  The words are generally beautiful, if opaque; and while Moore claims this his most personal work, he also freely admits that he's a lover of language and not one to just come out and say things as if these were autobiographical story-songs.<br /><br />The results are enigmatic, but for my tastes that's a strength.  A listener can project themself into this lambent, liquid universe Moore has conjured and be buoyed up with the songs.  Over the years, with Sonic Youth and as a solo artist, Thurston Moore has ably proven himself an adept interpreter of the electric guitar.  Here, he's hewn out a new, breathable and even airy record that flirts with folk and chamber pop -- and most immediately, dares to aspire to beauty.ecord.

B003XVYLDU|2.0|I read this book because it's labeled as such a classic.  It was an interesting book but I found it to be highly overrated.    After thinking about the book some more I decided that it's an interesting commentary on a war culture. We as a world haven't experienced war and death on the level of the world wars in a long time. After trying to view the book from that point of view I can see it as an interesting view on the nature of death.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I don't think people have realized yet how wonderful this movie is, but I'm telling everyone!  Great first, second, and twentieth watch!  Much deeper story than you pick up the first time, highly recommend watching it a few times to pick some of the underlying philosophy.  Can't say enough good things about it, loved it!  Looks great in BLU-RAY too!
B005HS00V4|5.0|I am a long time PG fan.  Genesis fan.  I never saw him with Genesis.  I remember this dude in high school said, \\"hey Jim, I have an extra ticket to see The Lamb tour, Genesis.\\"  I said, \\"WTF is a Lamb Genesis?\\"  I discovered later....  When I heard the instrumental covers cd, I didn't care for it.  I wanted his own music.  I have the cd. I like his music better with the orchestra. Now I have ordered this disc and my first blu-ray(I bought the panasonic btw) player.  I have a nice tv, and great surround sound.  It is not up to the most current specs, but, I paid over 2 grand for an hd tv a few years ago, and damn, that thing is going to die before I buy a new one.  I want the latest, but....things should be built to last.  :P  Anyway.  new player, new disc.  I will update in a few days. I hope that I added to the conversation.  Buy or die.

0471463396|5.0|Its pretty rare to find a book that actually has something to say about value investing that is an improvement over the original book from Ben Graham, The Intelligent Investor (1934 edition).  Value Investing delivers a good overview of the value investing approach and then also delivers hands on practical advice about some recent innovations in equity analysis for value investors.<br /><br />Using the approach popularized by Ben Graham this book describes the theoretical approach and then walks through two detailed examples of how to apply the notion of enterprise value to WD-40 and Intel.  With detailed analysis of financials from both companies the book demonstrates how to understand financial structures that help predict and quantify a company's competitive advantage.<br /><br />I've read a lot of value investing books that talk about competitive advantage, but this is the first book I've found that attempts to demonstrate directly from the balance sheet how to calculate the economics of that competitive advantage.<br /><br />I still want to apply everything I've read here to a dozen companies and see how well the analysis works in the real world, but the theoretical framework appears to offer a very easy way to determine who really has a franchise and then place a fair value on that advantage and establish a fair price for the stock.
1595478728|4.0|I am not sure why I had never read this Chesterton classic until now.  I had really missed a gem.<br /><br />It is an autobiographical account of a spiritual journey by a great mind.  It is full of important ideas, common sense, and humor.  In addition to being a positive defense of Christianity, it also refutes some spiritual/religious fallacies such as the similarities between Christianity and Buddhism.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that I read this with the Kindle application on my IPad.  It is one that should be read in a physical book, so that one can easily highlight and review some of the amazing thoughts and quotes.  Be assured that I will be buying another version of this, so that I can do just that.  It is also one that will be a pleasure to re-read.
1451648537|2.0|I do not want to dissuade anyone from reading this book but I find myself infuriated with the author for losing the opportunity to findout what Mr. Jobs was actually thinking and feeling about events. In over 2000 pages, on my iPad, I still don't have any insight into how the subject felt about and interpreted the same events as others. Despite interviewing Mr. Jobs, the author fails to give the reader what it was I was looking for, the inner mindset of this man. All the information given is a great history book on the evolution of a company and all the vicissitudes and complexities that centered around this guy, it would have been nice to share with us Steve's take on all this, especially now that he is deceased. What a shame to not give him a chance to interpret what everybody else is saying about him. The author is obviously an accomplished historian and for historical purposes gets bogged down in minutia. Similar to his other books, he is able to recount events rather than personal discourse from the individual he is writing about, as all the others were dead when he wrote the books. We'll never know what Ben Franklin or Steve Jobs was thinking when they made history.

B001HN6922|5.0|The first Cars movie was great in in the story and animation quality but I honestly don't really like it that much, I put it with the same quality of Boltz (Disney), How to Train Your Dragon (Dreamworks), Madagascar (Dreamworks), Despicable Me (Universal) but I personally prefer the Incredibles, Monster Inc., Toy Story series, Finding Nemo (all Disney), Shrek series, Megamind (Dreamworks), Ice Age series (Sony). Anyway, the second movie, Cars 2 is better than the first one if we are open minded, not too demanding that the movie should follow the same concept and atmosphere of the first one. It has a great story and deep messages such as \\"friendship (actually, any kind of relationship, not just friendhsip ;p) is more important than any earthly accomplishment or quarrel\\", \\" be ourselves\\", \\"not everything is what it seems\\", \\"loyalty\\", \\"trust\\", etc. then it also has great Bond-like action sequences, awesome comedies and details in culture and as in any other Pixar movies, the animation is just stunning!!  I understand that some people don't like it for their reasons, like too many \\"deaths\\" of cars or thread of \\"deaths\\" or just leave the Radiator Spring characters and atmospheres behind, but again, we should accompany and educate our children anyway when we watch movies, if we want a totally kid-appropriate then stay with PBS kids or other children programs and also let the Disney Pixar team have fun venturing their characters out of their hometown atmosphere, it'll give a fresh atmosphere and colors to the main characters they choose and how they react to these new environments, sometimes this idea works well and sometimes not, but for me, it works very well, this put this Cars 2 to my top list with \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Megamind\\", \\"Monster Inc.\\" etc.   Honestly, for me, this movie might fit better for the adult audiences than the yonger audiences, since the spy story, the scheme the bad guys plot, even some of the jokes are migth only be understood by adult audiences. The adults will have to explain to their little ones what's going on and why. If not, 90% the younger audiences/children will get bored when there are no carricature jokes, no racing or no fighting. My 5 yr old son kinda got bored, too, when the first time he watched this. After watching it again on DVD, I can pause the movie, explain some plots and jokes first then continue with the movie, he understood more and got more excited to continue watching it (*v^)//  First movie, more for kids and younger audiences, second movie, more for bigger kids and adult audiences. Hope this help.  Sincerely  Andy
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I sincerely tried to listen to this album and enjoy it; but the enjoyment never came. Musically Metallica is playing some decent metal riffs, but Lou Reeds incoherent babblings ruin everything on this album. Definitely not worth the money.

0553582038|5.0|Fans of the first three books, ignore the negative reviews and give the book a shot. This is the same GRRM that you know and love. AFFC continues the epic story. There are more characters introduced (that you might not care about) but every single one adds to the narrative in necessary ways. As always, these books are more about the grand narrative and not the individual characters. Great writing, great story, I just hope he finishes the series in this decade....

B005AUWY90|3.0|Saw this in theatres - it was the first Pixar movie that didn't make me cry.  My kids (5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son) loved the movie, but I was simply meh about it.  It looked amazing, at least... bought the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack and feel entirely RIPPED OFF.  The Blu-ray has the EXACT SAME FEATURES as the DVD - and that's it!!!  Disney's been bragging for friggin' YEARS that Blu-ray holds five times the data as regular DVDs - well then FILL IT, you idiots.  Or at least attempt to give the consumer their money's worth.  I am quite disappointed and will think twice before buying any more Disney/Pixar Blu-rays.

0375703764|2.0|This was a chore to get through. At times it was very effectively creepy, but its far too long, and its pretension is much heavier than its insight. I thought I would be rewarded for actually reading all the fancywork, and I was disappointed. Yeah, it's clever making the reader have to flip the book around and such, but if most of the words are just ornamental, it just ends up being a frustrating exercise.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I know people may say '21' by Adele has album of the year but i find this album better in terms of production! It's a huge record and actually outdoes its predecessor. From the first track 'Only If For A Night', you become instantly attached. Florence is the real machine on this album because it's all about her! Highly recommend this one.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is the second small Behringer mixer I've purchased this year (I also have the Xenyx 1202fx).  So far I have been extremely pleased with both mixers.  I use the 802 to record instruments (bass, guitar, keyboard, drum machine) directly into my laptop, with the assistance of an Edirol RCA-to-USB converter.  The channels are clear and noiseless.  What \\"imprints\\" onto the cakewalk tracks shows no discernible sign of distortion or coloration.  All jacks and knobs work well and appear solidly built.  There are no effects, but I wouldn't use them anyway so that is a non-issue for me.  Note that there is no on/off switch (again, not a problem for me personally as I turn on my equipment with line plug switches).  Also, the light is VERY bright, but that is easily solved by covering it with a small piece of electrical or duct tape.  I highly recommend both mixers.
0525423656|4.0|Cassia is on a mission to find Ky who was sent by The Society to the Outer Provinces, but, thankfully, escaped.  While trying to search for him, she comes across clues and gets to see what life is like closer to the border.  During Cassia's journey, she learns the truth about many things including more information about the Uprising.  Crossed by Ally Condie is an entertaining follow-up to Matched and the second half of the novel will leave readers in a state of suspense.<br /><br />Cassia shares the point of view with Ky and it alternates each chapter. This took me awhile to get used to, because I'd prefer the narration to be one hundred percent Cassia's; however, I understand why Condie had to do this.  Cassia is still such a fascinating heroine and I loved to follow her on her journey.  Readers will learn more about the world that Cassia lives in and the Outer Provinces which hold many secrets. I must admit that I found Cassia's journey to be a tad tedious and repetitive until the second half of Crossed which is when things really heated up.<br /><br />Ky, although not my favorite character, was entertaining nonetheless, because readers will learn more about his background in Crossed.  It was interesting to read the chapters from his point of view and in turn, readers can better understand where he is coming from.  All the while, Xander is still someone referred to a lot and thought a lot about by both characters. I wish there were more of him in Crossed!  Cassia is still harboring feelings for him and there's another secret that he's withholding as well.  Fans of Xander will only get to see him briefly as this is more Cassia and Ky's book.<br /><br />I really enjoy Condie's writing style. The incorporation of poetry and her lyrical descriptions are lovely. I found myself re-reading certain lines that flowed so beautifully.  Her graceful writing style was juxtaposed by the rustic setting and raw emotions in Crossed. She's so talented!<br /><br />Even though I am not in love with Crossed like I was Matched, I recognize that it serves its function as a setup for what I think is going to be an incredible finale. The ending of Crossed left me dying to find out what happens next and Condie left us with a heck of a cliffhanger.  I can't believe we have to wait a whole year!ched, I recognize that it serves its function as a setup for what I think is going to be an incredible finale.

B00336G7HI|4.0|The only gripe I have about this battery is that its full charge is about 20 minutes, give or take a few, less than the original battery. Other than that, it holds charge really well and is great to have in your pocket when your stuck halfway down a mountain side filming downhill racers! :)
B004LWZW42|5.0|One of the better X-Men Movies to come along.  May just be the best one aside from, maybe the first. It explains the origins of, and the basis behind the relationship between Professor-X, and Eric Lensher(AKA-Magneto), the creation of \\"Cerebro\\", and the beginings of their school for the gifted.  Among the many cool characters of \\"First Class\\", most notably we see the origin of Beast, very cool. We meet the devilish Azazel, who is Nightcrawler's father, and who can also teleport. And we get to see just how Professor-X becomes paralyzed and ends up in his iconic wheelchair.  One of the coolest things about the movie is how it is anchored in actual historical events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, and how they interweave real w fiction. Another is the more comic-book-esque, authentic, yellow and blue costumes they adapted for this incarnation, which were done very nicely. You also can't go wrong w the casting of the main characters, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Prof. X and Magneto. Two legit actors that give the movie credibility and strength.   Overall an excellent movie, esp if u like comic-book based movies. Interesting story, great actors, good execution, and def some super cool, mutant action..! Def a great one to own..!!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This thing is light and compact in my opinion. I have a Sony HDR-CX110 and it fits perfect even with a fisheye lens. My friends Canon DSLR camera fit with room to spare as well. There is also an adapter on the top for an extra light that I have not yet used, but it will come in handy. Or if you dont have a light you could zip tie a small flashlight or two to the bottom rails of the X-grip as a quick rig up! In short, I am glad I bought this!

1417734035|4.0|It took a long time for me to track Ed Emberly's books down with just my memories from 30 years ago.  When I found them, I immediately had to get them for my kids.  They like them, but it doesn't hold their interest as well as they did when I was a kid.  Probably a generational thing.  Sometimes, my 5-year old will break the book out on her own and do some doodles.  She leaves them on my nightstand for me to find.  It's cute.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|No time for a detailed review, but there are plenty of those already here, so I'll keep it short.    Mustaine has once again proven his musical genius and has further cemented himself as perhaps THE most epic, elite metal master of all time.  You can always count on Dave to deliver the goods, regardless of his supporting lineup.  Ellefson's return is definitely felt on Th1rt3en, and although a few of the tracks sound somewhat recycled, it doesn't even matter, because they still KICK @SS.  Every track is solid, and many are standouts.  I'm about 10 listens into this, and the tracks continue to get better with each listen.  If you are a Megadeth fan or just a fan of great metal, this one cannot be missed.  And for those of you who rated this 2 stars -- WTF.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is a very good album and recommended to all fans, I got it years after its release be because I had it in mp3 format but lately thought I must own the CD as a part of my Dream Theater collection, this is the six album I bought for them.

B003F3NDWG|2.0|All of the discs were in perfect condition except for the third disc. The review didn't say anything about a disc being damaged, so I paid $25 for a damaged disc, and I was not too happy when I found out because I couldn't return it because I opened it
0062014102|5.0|Some of the material in this book I have heard about before, however the book is so well put together I breezed through it with pleasure.  I am amazed at how I was able to read through the book so easily with all the technical information.  In the past I would have been bored and skipped through it.  Great book I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the other possibilities of what reality is.
0439796644|5.0|Wonderful book!  Read it in one sitting.  Bought this copy for my sister's birthday.  She'll love it, I'm sure.  Can't wait to see the movie of the book, by Steven Spielberg, this Chirstmas.  I cried throughout the book and would love to see the Tony-Award winning Broadway play of WAR HORSE, too.  Wonderful story! ! !
B003Y5H574|5.0|Crazy, Stupid, Love is wonderful. It's smart, funny, sweet, romantic...just everything. You see a man's life torn apart and you'd think you would hate his wife Emily but you can see that she's missing something in her relationship with Cal and he's sees it too. And you just root for these two the whole time. Then you have Cal's son who is in love with his babysitter and you can't help but feel hopeful as you see this young boy believe so strongly in true love. Add in Ryan Goslings and Emma Stone to show you how maybe lust at first sight can turn into something more. Brilliant movie. I walked out of the theater adding it to at least my top ten favorite movie list!
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I really can't add to the reviews.  I think the album is solid and worth buying. It shows growth both musically and lyrically.  Dave has something to say about the world again, perhaps we should listen.  I digress.  I wanted to touch on the album artwork.  We have the enigmatic Vic Rattlehead being put to rest on the rear of the CD.  On the cover itself we see Vic with his back turned toward us.  What is Dave trying to tell us?  I understand that you can't go on forever, but in my selfish idea of my metal hero's I never want them to retire.  For me it seems that Megadeth on the whole is finally receiving the recognition that it deserves (not that it matters) but how does the world miss out on Megadeth, while the Sheeple feed on only Metallica.  At the very least if Dave plans to retire from touring, I hope Megadeth at will stay at least a studio band.  This music is too great to just die, or walk away from.  Megadeth gives their fans something on which to hang their collective hats.  I pray it doesn't stop.   Thanks for reading.  I wanted to open the dialog on the album cover, I hope that was accomplished.
1451648537|5.0|The cult of Apple has waxed and waned over the years. But if you look over your shoulder, in front of you, in your pocket or next to you ... you are bound to be touched by some Apple device in one way or another.  There is no way to avoid this.  Steve Jobs and his pet company Apple brought consumers like me devices we did not know we needed ... until they were shown to us.  In that same way, Walter Isaacson coins a book  on the oft prickly Steve Jobs that we did not know we needed.  But if you are part of the Cult of Apple, this is a read you should consider.<br /><br />Zen, simplicity, temperamental, cocky.  Adjectives that are woven throughout the story of Jobs' life.  Nary a detail is left out ... and Steve himself had no interest in reading the book.  Without Steve's control and censorship, the reader gets an intimate look into the work ethic and life ethic of this man.  The man who lived simply, demanded perfection down to the tiniest of details, and control ... we get the chance to enter into the \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" that Steve lived in and lived by.  In most everything, rules did not apply to him and he lived in a world filled with magical thinking.  But it is this magical thinking and vision that brought much of the beauty to Apple, it's stores and all of it's product lines.<br /><br />It's Steve's way or the highway ... he was able to get his way with most ventures.  From starting out a venture in a garage with Steve Wozniak to his time at Pixar and butting heads with Disney.  It's all in here, in this book, chronicled so well and orderly.  I think Steve would've appreciated the homage given to him even if there were truths within that he didn't like.<br /><br />The book shows the diverse, perfectionistic, visionary that Steve Jobs is and will continue to be as he leaves his legacy on a company he formed and created.  Don't expect inspiration in the sense of warm feelings and personal redemption, even Steve who had Cancer and was weak and sick did not allow the disease process to change the man he innately was:  mercurial and at times condescending, short-tempered and insensitive to the feelings of others.  Isaacson's tome is honest in that portrayal.  While there is nothing particularly \\"saintly\\" about Steve Jobs (he didn't give much credence to philanthropy and didn't care much about money unless it involved bringing appropriate attention to him), there is something very, very special about his vision, business simplicity and ability to create products that were simple and perfect ... and that perfection and simplicity was demanded by all of those who surrounded him in his inner circle.<br /><br /> ... and just one more thing ... this book does not disappoint.  For all of those who are part of the cult of Apple or interested in the brand, the man and all that he embodied, this is the one to read.<br /><br />5 starschange the man he innately was:  mercurial and at times condescending, short-tempered and insensitive to the feelings of others.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Too many stars trying to get enough screen time to make their appearance justified. It's good but not great and is a definite send up of the classic 80's Rambo films that started with , well Rambo. An action star orgasm of every thought guy cliche with every tough guy in it. A fun movie but didn't utilize the ensemble cast as effectively as Oceans 11 did.Eric Roberts was the perfect 80's bad guy and played it just enough over the top to not be silly, but he did dance on the edge. He did make the classic 80's bad guy mistake, he messed with the heros girl
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Roughly 500 years in the future, death becomes avoidable. Initially used as a method for deep space travel, a person's consciousness can be digitally stored for an indefinite amount of time and then downloaded into a \\"cortical stack\\" of an unoccupied human body or \\"sleeve.\\" However, the procedure does require financial means, and even then only the very rich can get their original body back. This scientific breakthrough, along with space travel, true A.I., virtual reality, biological enhancement, cloning, and other technological advances, haven't served to better mankind as much as further complicated it. Class separation is even more extreme, now that the prosperous have several lifetimes to increase their power. Religious factions oppose man-made immortality. Meanwhile, generations are born and re-sleeved on distant planets while Earth is slowly becoming a relic.   To help maintain control of colonies at the farthest reaches of the galaxy, the UN Protectorate created shock troops called the Envoys, which deploy by instantaneous galactic digital transfer into waiting cortical stacks of bio-enhanced sleeves. The Envoys are elite combat soldiers and counter-intelligence operatives feared throughout the known universe, and Takeshi Kovacs used to be one of them.   A wealthy businessman, Laurens Bancroft, was recently murdered and had to be re-sleeved. With the police claiming his death was suicide, Bancroft needs the best to find his killer. Kovacs is the best, so Bancroft arranges to have him transported to Earth.   Altered Carbon is an action-packed, who-done-it mystery that hooked me to the very end. I state with the utmost respect that my mind imagined visuals of the movie Blade Runner as I read it. (After all, Mr. Morgan has made the comparison himself.) Blade Runner's Los Angeles and Altered Carbon's San Francisco could exist in the same future. Rick Deckard and Takeshi Kovacs could be brothers, though Kovacs would be the mean brother that beat up on Deckard whenthey were kids.   The technological advances in Altered Carbon are mindboggling and believable at the same time. The vision of the future, although grim, is so relatable to our current world that it's easy to accept as reality. Woes that have always plagued mankind, like class separation, abuse of power, and the conflict between government and religion, continue and become more extreme.   Despite incredible scientific achievements being crucial elements to the story, Altered Carbon has the mood and excitement of a crime thriller that just happens to be set in the far future. And the voice of Takeshi Kovacs' narration increases that ambiance.  True to the story's tone Kovacs is the classic noir private-eye, only increased tenfold. Though haunted by the violence of his past, Kovacs is ready, willing, and capable to react with violent action whenever necessary, or maybe just because he's pissed off. On the surface, Kovacs may seem lawless and self-serving but he lives by his own code and is a man of his word.  Richard K. Morgan has the deep understanding of human nature and society that the best authors have. Without distracting from the story, he raises profound questions about what it is that makes a person who they are. Is it the physical body, mind, memories, or is it truly all those things combined? And if that is the case, if just one of those elements gets changed, is a different individual created? However, one thing is certain: in Altered Carbon, being immortal doesn't make life any easier.  Morgan impressed me even more with his ability to bring written words to life. The perception of Earth being an antiquated remnant of human history weighs like a constant dark shadow. The sexual interludes are more erotic than an evening spent in a high-end strip club. I would've given up any secret asked when just reading about a character being interrogated by torture. Because Kovacs' sleeve was a smoker, his constant struggle with that habit made me crave a cigarette,and I haven't smoked seriously in over twenty years.  Wherever Takeshi Kovacs goes, Hell is sure to follow and so will I. I had such a great time with Richard K. Morgan's book that along with the rest of the KOVACS novels, I'll be checking out his sword & sorcery series, A LAND FIT FOR HEROES.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I never thought I would publicly leave a bad review for anything Metallica did.  As someone who was a teenager in the 90's and pretty much grew up playing guitar, Metallica was a mainstay of my motivation and repertoire.  I had every note of every instrument memorized for every song on Ride the Lightning through the Black album (never really got into Kill 'Em All that much, although it does have some classic songs).  When Load and ReLoad came out, I recognized that Metallica was going in a new direction, but even though it wasn't as aggressive as their previous efforts, it was still well-composed for the most part, and some of the songs were quite good.  St. Anger was garbage so I won't say anything else about it.  Death Magnetic was a step back in the right direction and had some decent moments.  If any other band had released that album it would've been great, but you know from Metallica you expect more.  So when I heard Lulu was released, I was anxious to hear it to see the direction they were going.  To sum it up, it is perhaps one of the 5 worst albums I have ever heard in my life across all genres.  Every song is just some talking, not singing, but talking over some basic metal background music (which is recognizable as being Metallica), although sometimes it is acoustic and sometimes it is just background noise.  It's not melodic.  It's not well-composed.  It's not anything.  Well, it's like a metal version of indie music.  If you skip through the song \\"Mistress Dread\\" by grabbing the progress bar and moving it, you can't even tell that you're skipping through it because it's the same chord and bass for the entire song.  I wouldn't be surprised if hipsters and indie music fans liked Lulu, as it meets all the formulaic requirements that they enjoy (talking vocals, simple backgrounds, no chord progressions to speak of, nothing melodic, yet a singer (speaker) that seems strangely passionate about whatever he is talking about), but metal fans and Metallica fans will hate it.  And so will anyone else who likes their music to be musical.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Nothing else to say.  Those who are not getting it, are probably the ones mentioned in the movie who move on very easily.
0060730552|5.0|Wow - a real page turner! I'm very stingy with 5-star ratings, but I got so engrossed in the book that it deserves all 5 in my mind. This is a stunning story of survival and human emotion told in a way that brings the reader into the mind of the author.
0385535139|3.0|We've read almost every fictional outing by this ex-lawyer, best-selling author known for his legal thrillers. And while \\"Litigators\\" for sure is about lawyers and litigation, this one covers maybe the seedier side of the law profession (we'll resist the obvious punch line!), with two low-life lawyers scraping along chasing ambulances and hoping for a get-rich home run when they find people who have had loved ones die after taking a certain cholesterol reducing drug. They decide to sue the drug company, hook up with some celebrity attorneys with national tort law reputations, and await what will hopefully be a settlement windfall. Meanwhile, David Zinc, toiling for five years as a lowly associate in a typical high-rise law firm, with basically no life, \\"cracks up\\", quits, and joins the two-guy office after spending an entire day in a bar! Most of the book then continues from his perspective as he gets embroiled in the big litigation scheme versus the drug company and their bevy of hot-shot lawyers; and the trial that ensues sheds much light on this whole side of the lawyering trade. Zinc happens to discover another possible case involving a toy set of false teeth that appear to have lead-poisoned a Burmese immigrant family's son -- so that sub-plot at least adds a little uplift to the book.
B004VSAJ6C|2.0|I can see the appeal of releasing a \\"Best of the Ballads\\" for a band like Aerosmith who has had many hit ballads.  But what are fast songs doing in this collection?  Love In An Elevator and Rag Doll are not ballads.  They are not even about love.  They are about casual sex.    I am sure this album is coming from the record company and not from the band.  I just hope they can release one more good studio album before Steven or Joe kick the bucket.    I have been a fan since fifth grade.  I realize they relapsed with drugs and they are pretty darn old now, but we need a new record for the love of Pete!!  I know they are supposedly working on one now, but I have heard that at least three times from the band over the last 10 years.  I can't believe it until I see it.  I keep hoping though.
1250004217|4.0|It's not perfect, but the story lines are both very compelling. Like many other reviewers, I preferred Sarah's chapters, and was disappointed that they ended within two weeks. I would have liked for her voice to be carried throughout the book, but the way it is written really echoes the Holocaust experience, as that time of trauma and terror overshadows the rest of a person's life.   I thought the end of the book was fumbled a bit and should have been wrapped up more quickly, perhaps with a simple epilogue. And the idea of bringing Julia and William together romantically is just absurd.  There are lots of translation issues, like \\"dress code\\" instead of \\"wardrobe\\" and lots of lengthy words that are not used in quite the right context, but the flaws sort of lend themselves to the international vibe of the book. But truly, these should have been caught during the editing process.  And this is just nit-picky, but giving Julia parents born during the Depression but named Heather and Sean...Really?  I guess it doesn't sound as though I liked the book, but I really did! The Sarah parts and Julia parts have different tones but mirror each other nicely. It's clear the author put a lot of time into research.
B005KMX866|5.0|This album met and exceeded my expectations.  My husband, who grew up listening to the original artists, put them on and listened to both CD's twice in a row.  What an amazing job Chris does with these classics.
B0060URV9M|5.0|This episode is packed full of some of the best, darkly humorous dialogue of the entire series. The scene in the diner where Sam and Dean's evil clones are complaining about their real-life counterparts is a tongue-in-cheek tour de force. And that's just one little scene of an excellent blend of horror, dark comedy, action, love (a little!) and human emotional drama; this episode's got it all! In a two part scene, first with evil-clone Dean and then with the real Dean, the other shoe finally drops about Dean killing Sam's nice-monster friend so now the boys can fight about it and then deal with it. In my opinion a great, classic Supernatural episode.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Never has Grisham written a funnier work. The characters are interesting and sympathetic, but also highly comic! The ultimate of the cholesteral drug lawsuit is almost inevitable from the beginning, but the final reversal of fortunes is most gratifying. Don't know if the law really always works this way, but perhaps it should.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Their best days were over several years ago. Ever since the mid '90s they had problems in their career, they sold out and stopped being a metal band and were more mainstream rock. On St. Anger they tried being nu-metal and everyone hated it. They had it on Death Magnetic and were heading the right direction, this is a complete letdown. Death Magnetic was the real Metallica, they got everyone's hopes up and than continued putting out below average music This album shows that they're 100% dead. Megadeth have been putting out good records ever since The System Has Failed, Slayer's worst moments are masterpieces compared to Metallica's. If Lars Ulrich is so against illegal downloads than why doesn't he try to make music good enough for people to spend their hard earned money on. Not everyone's rich and can afford to throw away their money for this garbage. If Cliff Burton was still alive he would be very disappointed with the band.
1423140591|5.0|I ordered the book for my granddaughter who is a huge Riordan fan. I must admit that I have become addicted, as well. Great reads, especially for those of us who learned a mythology in \\"old school.\\"
0887081770|5.0|I have the board book version of this book and just thought I'd add that for people looking for books for their infants that have an actual story, this is a wonderful book.  I am a father and have been reading this to my daughter since she was about 3 months old.  She obviously doesn't understand it yet (she is 7 months now) but her face lights up every time I pull it off the shelf (and believe me, it doesn't light up for every book, so she definitely likes this book for some reason....it might be the pages that fold out and the colorful illustrations).  Anyway, kids don't need to be able to understand the story to enjoy this book and it especially sweet for fathers to read to their kids.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Anyone that is a Star Wars fan will have opinions on what is right and just in the world of Star Wars. In my opinion, being able to watch this in high-definition and high quality surround sound far outweighs the minuscule changes they made to the Blu-ray version. Yes, I would have loved to have the choice of original (pre-anniversary changes) and modified, but I am a FAN!   George, you had me at \\"...and restore freedom to the galaxy...\\"
B000NIVJHM|5.0|It seemed to take the awhile to receive the item through the mail but the condition and packaging was great. No complaints here.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|I have read all of Sanderson's books starting with the Mistborn series (except the Wheel of Time ones, a series I was out on early) and they have been consistently enjoyable and worthwhile.  Good enough to cause me to buy them based on the author.<br /><br />This book is very long (something I actually like) and starts very slowly.  It is hard to follow and hard to get into at first.  I started and stopped several times.  But I kept going back based on past experience/satisfaction with his books.  Somewhere around halfway through you finally start to identify with the main characters (there are still many that do not seem to have a place yet) and sort of start to identify with the world.  The second half is starts to suck you in.  By the end, I was very disappointed that I will have to wait on upcoming volumes.  I hate to think about the timeline to write 10 books of this depth.<br /><br />I might have to wait for a few years and pick back up when they are halfway done......
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Endgame is still their best modern album but it's amazing besides that. Endgame was a heavier, more thrash direction and on Thirteen they went back to the Countdown to Extinction era. Megadeth are a lot better off than Metallica, at least at this point of their career. They had problems in the past with Cryptic Writings and Risk but after that they've returned to heavy metal and have been able of staying in the right direction. It's not Rust in Peace but it's amazing how good it is considering that their last 3 already were. So far they're still on the right track.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Charlize!However,this movie is really slow,difficult to stay with it,in other words,boring.The first 2 times I tried to watch the movie I fell asleep,both times!!Really,it's the gods truth!!Charlize was fantastic,sexy amd smart.She also does at least 90% of the stunts,many of those in this flick.I'm sorry to say though that I can't recommend this movie but the 2nd disk is very informative and again,in some areas,boring.This movie gets only 2 stars!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Great CD.  I would definitely recommend it to others. I especially like the song \\"Secrets.\\" I love One Republic and watching them perform.
0071762345|5.0|The lessons in the book are really summed in these 4 points. Obviously there's much more to it. But in reality, social media marketing is about your customers, not you. And no matter the metric you are trying to achieve, these 4 points keep you on the path to success in this boundless arena. Each technique in the book builds on one of these core points. The author then uses examples from real situations.  In one example, he describes poor customer service he experienced at a hotel in Las Vegas. While in line, he tweeted about it. A rival hotel responded, simply apologizing and wishing him a nice stay in town. Where did he stay his next time there? That's right, the rival.  But it didn't stop there. He also \\"liked\\" the rival hotel's Facebook page. Some of his friends noticed his \\"like\\" during their own hotel research. They decided to stay there as well due to his  recommendation.  It's a great example of the power of social media. And it really gets you excited to read more. Only a few chapters in, I felt myself thinking of how what I'd read could apply to my daily work as a web developer/business owner.  Each chapter begins with an issue. Then, the author explains the heart of the problem and a technique for using social media.  Next, real-world examples show the technique successfully implemented by leading companies (Starbucks, UNOs Chicago Pizza, Stride Rite, Omaha Steaks, and more). Finally, each chapter concludes with a list of \\"Action Items,\\" as a form of home practice, with a brief summary.  As a visual learner, I truly enjoyed so many clear examples from the author. It gave me many ways to visualize the techniques described and see how organizations have used them for success in different ways. I typically found a situation in each chapter that I could relate to.  As I read further, though, I found some of the points repetitive. This is largely because many examples worked across techniques. For example, one chapter asks you to \\"be authentic,\\" while the nextasks you \\"be honest and transparent.\\" Both are good points, but the material was similar and ruined a bit of the momentum and excitement that chapters before had generated.  Also, the author really skips the topic of social media analytic tools. While I was a bit disappointed, I will not hold it against him as these seem to change daily. Perhaps that can be a follow-up.  Buy this book, which is what I now call \\"the manual.\\" Social media offers you a way to listen to your customers, target almost anyone, and interact like never before. This book will get you a long ways toward an effective plan. I am truly excited to implement some of the techniques covered in my social media marketing as well as general business practices.
B004EPZ08E|3.0|What a waste. All three leads can be very funny, but here rarely are. The script is weak and predictable for the most part, and the best performances come from Farrell and Spacey, and JA to a lesser degree. There were a few laughs here and there but after about an hour we were waiting for it to end as we knew it must, and it did, in most every way. The action scenes are just pointless kitchen-sink type filler, and all in all this cast deserved a much tighter and funnier script.<br /><br />But Farrell really is classic in his bit part, such a nice role for him to pick; not many A-list actors would take that part, let alone knock it out of the park. And Spacey is becoming one of the best mean screen guys around. But still, they can't really redeem the same-old same-old (plus pointless f-bombs) feel of much of this.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I am not really a fan of either Reed or Metallica, which is probably why I loved this. Its a different sound. The world needs different sounds. I listed with open ears. Found it moving and interesting.
1612680003|5.0|This book toatly changed the way I look at money.  I will no longer stay on the left side, but will now make my way to the right.  Because of this book I have ordered the next book and have finished that one also !!!  Lots of info.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Transformers-Dark Side of the Moon is very good.The action is exciting and nearly continueous,Shia Labeouf is as intense and girl screaming funny as last time.The special effects-the Transformers same as before,FANTASTIC!!!Unfortunetly,my favorite honey was replaced,Megan Fox!!!But,not to worry,the new girl is at least as hot,a bit leggier,blond hair,but over inflated lips!The first T-movie,I gave it 5 stars,the next one-4.5 stars,this last one gets 4 stars.If you liked the other Transformers movies,that you should like Dark Side of the Moon!Enjoy.
B000002UKS|5.0|...this is the second CD by the Grunge Rock band, that is the Foo Fighters. Dave Grohl originally tried to do a Trent Reznor-type one man band thing, but that completely sucked. So, he got his best friend Taylor Hawkins to quit drumming for Alanisse Morissette and join him. Then, they got the only other people they knew that were capable of playing instruments. This is the result of that: an emotional rollercoaster ride through everything that was, or could have been post-Kurt Cobain Grunge Rock. All 14 tracks on this CD are perfectly in synch, not only the big hits that everyone knows. Yes, my favorite Foo Fighters song is \\"My Hero\\", but this is just soooo much more. It's an essential album of modern Rock if you like modern Rock. If you're interested in this band, there's no better place to start.
1451648537|3.0|This book is unfortunately written for the lowest common denominator and I'd have to imagine the readability score is in the 7-9th grade level. That detracted from the whole the entire time I was reading it and I couldn't help but think of the irony of how inelegant the text is of someone that did nothing but slave for elegance. It is a big letdown in that regard. Many topics are repeated but instead of ever offering additional insight they are simply just repeated. Another reviewer likened it to a school-age book report, and honestly that is a very accurate and fair statement. There is some great information contained within, however, and some aspects of Jobs' life that were unknown before which makes it worth the read undoubtedly but it does fall flat overall. Despite itself, it is an interesting story of a man and a life that was really not that directly remarkable even though what spawned from it truly was. Steve Jobs showed that idealism, aesthetics, design, and art still have a very large impact and role in modern life even when almost everyone else is trying to diminish their value. I just wish the quality of the writing was up to the task.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|\\"TH1RT3EN\\"..,is Megadeth's latest offering, following up from 2009's \\"ENDGAME\\".  What can I say?  They somehow keep getting better with time.  I actually thought they wouldn't be able to top \\"Endgame\\", and I am happily wrong.  They did it again!  \\"TH1RT3EN\\" is like a collague of all of their work in the past albums interpreted and reflected here with incredible production, mixing, and mastering.  Not one song sucks. Each song has it's own individuality, which makes them all stand out independently.  Even though two of the songs were previously released for a video game, and three were unfinished demo's or songs from Megadeth's back catalogue, they fit well alongside the brand new songs, due to finally being complete and official now. Fans of \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" and \\"Youthanasia\\" will rejoice with this one. Go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I got mine in the mail yesterday as well. It was like opening an early Christmas present. Packaging is absolutely amazing. Box it came it, sweet. Book, beautiful. Art prints, cool. Content of CDs and DVDs, TBD. As a fan, I already own a lot of it. For the $120 we just spent, it woulda been hellacool of them to thrown in even more stuff we didn't already own. But as a fan and completist, I knew I had to own this. If I could've afforded it, I would've gotten the super super deluxe edition.
0545128285|5.0|If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, and you don't own this book, you are doing something wrong. This book is cute, fun, and informative. Definitely considered a companion book to \\"The Deathly Hallows.\\" And it's cute. The book is supposed to be Wizarding fairy tales, which includes commentary from Albus Dumbledore himself.   JK Rowling did the art work and it's an over all gorgeous book.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|The story was cool and thrilling. The adventure was captivating. The characters where all very well done.   The actors, Joel Courtney, Zach Mills, Elle Fanning, Ryan Lee, Gabe Basso, and Riley Griffiths all did a great job.  The writing, acting, directing, and camera work, as well as special effects where all 100% A+  I highly recommend this movie to all.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Love it. Love everything about it. It kind of reminds me of those beatnik coffee readings. I can see it now: Lou Reed up on stage playing the role of the beat poet, reading from a book (yes, I know he plays guitar on the album) with Metallica playing some very heavy music in the background. It is pure art. However, I will admit that it is not for everyone. Two thumbs up to Metallica for being ballsy...again!
B0055S348W|1.0|I pretty much given up on trying to save a privacy but these permissions are WAY too intrusive. What's with that ??
B00026ZG10|5.0|Action, adventure, overtly sexy and FUNNY!  Those were the days... when they made comedy-slash-something really comedic. This is one I had to purchase anew, mainly because the old DVD finally gave out having been viewed so many times over the years.
B0060URV9M|5.0|This is great episode of Supernatural, and that is high praise as any ep of Supernatural is better than most other things on TV. It is well written, with snappy dialogue, great action and moments of comedy and real emotional depth.   S7 has been back to the very highest standards of the show. I highly recommend it.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|It's hard to not make puns when it comes to the band, \\"Fun.\\" I've seen them in concert about four times, and each time they just keep getting better and better.   The purchase of this album was basically instantaneous. I saw it for sale on the Paramore spring tour of 2010, and I just had to have it. Fun. is like nothing you've ever heard before. The album is poppy, dancey, 60's, and just gorgeous. It's fun to put on the turn table (if you have the vinyl edition, which I do,) and blast from the speakers. You kind of just want to jump, dance, and move your body, while singing along with the vocal stylings of Nate Reuss. The album is perfect and gorgeous. If you like Steel Train, Gold Motel, The Hush Sound, and Stamps, (to name a few,) you will love this piece of work.
B00112GVFO|5.0|If you like escapist movies that aren't intended to be high art,  This is the ticket.  Its fast, its entertaining, its got Matthew McConaughey.    The trailer does it a dis-service.  Its contrived and not particularly indicative of the tenor of the movie.    I really don't know why so many people hate this movie.  Its as entertaining as others of its kind.  Knight and Day or Red for example.   Its not out to open new cinematic horizons, its out to entertain you.  And it does.    I enjoy the relationship between Dirk and Al.  McConaughey and Zahn have a great chemistry and should do more acting together.   The relationship between Cruz and McConaughey was not as well written, but its not obtrusively bad.  The action scenes are fun.  Particularly the boat.    Its lighthearted with plenty of banter and one liners.  Zahn, in particular, brings in the humor.    Lennie James is awesome as the dictator.  He should be seen more.  He is actually the best in the movie.    I have watched the movie multiple times, it still manages to entertain me.    I call that a 5 star hit.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|No band that I am familiar with does exactly what Florence + The Machine does, and they really are incredible. As with the first album, though, I find that at times the musical complexity, or noise clutter if you will, competes a little too much with the vocals. That's a shame when the vocals are so good! Every song sounds like the ultimate song of the album, no holds barred, cranked to eleven. I admire the band because of this and I certainly can't fault them for it, but after a while it's overwhelming and even emotionally draining. While that is my personal opinion, I assume some will have a greater tolerance for the power and complexity of this music and will enjoy it more thoroughly than I have.  Throughout the experience I found the most accessible and replay friendly songs to be:  What the Water Gave Me  No Light, No Light  Bedroom Hymns
B004I8WD7S|3.0|This case is very basic and comes with a screen protector. Both the screen film and case are easy to put on the iPhone 4S. The cutouts in the screen protector don't exactly line up with the camera and earpiece, but they're close enough.  The product is not stylish and is stamped with the Amazon basics logo on the back. It's bulkier than silicone cases, but seems more rugged. It's made of a pliable plastic material (not silicone), which feels hard on the hand and ear. It's rather uncomfortable as there are pointed edges that poke into your skin.  I do feel that my phone is protected in this product, so I'll give it a few stars, but I've seen much better.
0439023521|5.0|All of my friends had been telling me to read this book... I finally broke down and read it and I loved it. I couldn't put the book down. It kept me drawn into the story through every chapter. Can't wait for the movie.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Wow - this is an awesome album, but not at all what I was expecting.  I've been wishing Beth would make a straight up blues album and learning she'd collaborated with Joe B. I assumed it would be a balls to the wall collection of rowdy texas blues more like Koko Taylor meets Janis with Stevie Ray backing her up.  That's not what they made, but it's still a really great collection.  It's more like Joplin's Pearl versus Cheap thrills.  Much to my suprise, Beth can sing with much more retraint and subtlety than I thought possibile, only pushing her voice to the edge when the song's high points or climax require it.  This albums launches her into the big leagues - her vocals are stunning. The arrangements are more smokey jazz club than southern road house.  It's more of a slow burn than a the scorcher I expected but is well worth it.  \\"Sinner's Prayer\\", \\"I'll Take Care of You\\", \\"Something's Got a Hold On Me\\", are the most traditional bar room texas blues.  \\"For My Friends\\" is the most like previous Bonamassa discs - showing off his funky and muscular guitar work.  \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" is a great Tom Waits cover that deviates from the blues structure in his typical tin pan alley meets gypsy vibe.  \\"Don't Explain\\" and \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" are pretty faithful Billie Holiday and Etta James covers that stick close to the original arrangements.  My favorite is the Aretha cover \\"Ain't No Way\\" that closes the disc. Beth sounds relaxed and confindent and is in the best voice yet.    This disc may stretch the taste and expectations of fans of both Beth and Joe, but this is a grammy worthy collection that shows that they're capable of a lot more than the sound that made each famous.  I hope they do more and really let loose.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|Can't stop listening to this album since purchasing it. An incredible masterpiece! Every song is good. One of Maynard's best efforts for sure.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|I place this movie somewhere in between Superman Returns and Catwoman. It is not the worst movie that DC has put out, but it is close. The special effects on this film are mostly special and not very effective. The writing is on par with that of Superman Returns. That being said expect some bad romance to get in the way of your hard hitting action adventure. I will say that the movie did have some fun (though completely transparent) characters that kids can enjoy. The Blu Ray itself highlights some of the more obvious visual effect flaws with the film including the in ability to create an environment that allowed \\"real life\\" and CGI to look good together. All and all this Blu ray gets a 4/10. (or 2 stars so says amazon!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Buy this album. You'll love it. It's gorgeous, and soulful, and incredibly lush. Every track strives for - and achieves - a beautiful balance between Florence's amazing vocals and her signature orchestration and production. Expect a lot of big choruses, twinkling harps, dark lyrics, and sparkling piano riffs. And expect to hear most of these tracks in next year's movies and TV shows.<br /><br />I was one of the lucky few who found Florence + The Machine's \\"Lungs\\" back in 2009, via \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" (thank you, Morning Becomes Eclectic!). So it's been a looooong wait for album #2 (Lungs' B-sides notwithstanding). This album is one of those rare sophomore efforts that are simply worth the wait. If you really loved her first album, chances are very good you're going to go nuts about this one, too.<br /><br />Stand-out tracks include (but are not limited to):<br />2. \\"Shake It Out\\"<br />3. \\"What the Water Gave Me\\"<br />5. \\"Breaking Down\\"<br />6. \\"Lover to Lover\\"<br />7. \\"No Light, No Light\\"<br />8. \\"Seven Devils\\"<br />12. \\"Leave My Body\\"<br /><br />In fact, creating that list just now was pretty difficult, because every track has something really fun and/or gorgeous about it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone looking for simple, acoustic pop, that's for sure. But if you like your pop large, with a heaping side of orchestra and fantastic vocal harmonies (and a healthy pinch or two of darkness), this album's for you.<br /><br />Excellent work, Ms. Welch.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This purchase was perfect since I've been looking for her CD unopened for a friend of mine so I can replace the one that I damaged.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Best album this year! Wonderful lyrics, catchy beats, and AMAZING vocals!Thank you Kelly Clarkson for going into my brain, channeling me, and creating an entire album about how I feel! Awesome CD!! Helped me become stronger during this hard time in my life (no pun intended)
B00005NKKY|5.0|I still listen to this, more than 40 years after it was released, and get tears in my eyes.  It is just so good!  A very emotional album to listen to, especially as \\"Save the Life Of My Child\\" fades in to \\"America\\".  There are many who still declare \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" to be Simon and Garfunkel's best.  I have to disagree.  \\"Bookends\\" is their masterwork.
0385535139|2.0|John Grisham's latest book the Litigators uses the same formula he has always used: a sympathetic character set against a big company with no regard for the public good. The company is represented by a powerful law firm and is set to steamroll the opposition. The only problem here is it takes soooo long to get to the real crux of the matter. I found the book to be boring and tedious. Not highly recommended.
0756404738|4.0|While I agree with some of the sentiment in the reviews here, I think many unfairly punish this book by comparing it directly to the first book in this series, The Name of the Wind.  The Name of the Wind is one of the best fantasy novels, and one of the most enjoyable novels of any genre, that I have ever read.  Well-written, deeply moving and interesting.  The Wise Man's Fear is a very solid follow-up effort.  I devoured it via the Kindle app on my android phone, and never realized how long it was until reading the reviews here.  In fact, I was dismayed every time I started the app again to see how quickly I was moving thru the book, knowing how long it would be before I could continue the story via the third book.   This book DOES advance the story, despite what many reviews here have to say.  It moves the story along however only in the sense that it develops Kvothe's skill set and maturity level in order to (I presume) truly advance the overall story in the third book in a plausible fashion.  The writing is still excellent, and Kvothe remains a compelling and extremely sympathetic (no pun intended) character.  The transitions from one part of the story to the next did seem somewhat jarring at times, and I too wish we had discovered a bit more new information about the overall story (the Chandrian, the Amyr, Denna's patron/background, Kote, etc).  I can be patient when it comes to this series however, because it is that good.  It's worth it.
0385344325|1.0|I've read every Reacher book, but this one was my last.  [Unless imprisoned, or stranded on a desert island.]  The plot was egregiously bad - improbable to the point of laughability.  Further, it didn't add in any creative way to any sort of understanding of why Reacher is the way he is.  Apparently, he just never liked having a lot of clothes, and never liked authority, or toothpaste, for that matter.    spoiler alert:  I never bought Devereaux as a suspect.  What would be the odds that the spectacularly beautiful [from Lee Child's description]  Devereaux would decide to kill other stunning woman because she wanted to be the only stunning woman around or because of her rage at perceived romantic rivals?  Apparently, we were supposed to see her as the red herring killer because she had access to a deer trestle.  The book trudges along to a completely telegraphed ending with many pie-eating detours along the way.  [And Lee Child, if you happen to be reading this:  blueberry pie does have nutritive value, in the BLUEBERRIES.]    Are there any new mystery writers around who might be worth reading?  I didn't enjoy Sanford's or Evanovich's last couple books, either.  How did Dick Francis keep his series going so well for so long?
0062060554|5.0|It was such a well written page-turner and I couldn't put it down. I finished the book in only 1 day! I loved it! Cannot wait for more novels from this author.
B005EHNMWM|1.0|I've followed Wilco through their ever-increasing levels of pop abstraction; Jeff Tweedy from his days in Uncle Tupelo. But I think, after 20 years, this is where we part ways.<br /><br />The aspect of Wilco that worked for me up until this record was that I could locate the origins of Tweedy's beautiful songs through the expanding murk and discover something truly stunning. The melodies were strong enough to seep through the collective's (I still can't think of Wilco as a \\"band\\") penchant for piling on the variations and the purposefully distracting manufactured inorganic noise. \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" is human and warm. \\"The Whole Love\\" just leaves me cold.<br /><br />It might satisfy Wilco's longing to be recognized as \\"serious artists\\", but this latest edition goes beyond my limited patience for ponderous, over-produced and highly-orchestrated recorded music. There's not a spark of spontaneity to be found from front to back here. I very much didn't appreciate Yes or ELP or Uriah Heep when they were the rage, so why would I like The Whole Love now?<br /><br />If I'm going to indulge in this sort of thing, I'll leaf through Kandinsky's images or read Joyce. I'm too much of a Replacements/Westerberg die-hard to be up to the challenge of wishing rock'n'roll can be high art. Or I can flip back to Being There or YHF whenever I long for music that was brave and naive enough to let the rough side drag.<br /><br />Wilco is great. This record isn't.
0385534639|2.0|I really wanted to like this book but it was all I could do to finish it.  I did enjoy the creative environments and the characters, but it just plodded along and I can't remember feeling any type of emotion.  I kept looking to see if I was almost done yet.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Now I never been a Cronenberg fan, infact I hated Videodrome (please I don't want comments about why I hate it, I just do) but I realy enjoyed Scanners. The movie is about a group of people that have the power to kill and read others minds yet they have been oppressed by the normals till one day an evil scanner named Darryl Revok (played by Michael Ironside)decides that they should take over the \\"norms\\" by using an army of scanners, but CONSEC (evil inc.) decides that they don't wont to be overrun by scanners so they get a scanner named Cameron Vale (played by Stephen Lack) to fight Revok.    Okay so on to another big point in the movie was the special effects. The special effects for this film are good for a low budget film, from the head explosions to the vains poping out, all making a lovely splatter house of gore and guts.    Now finally we get to the bad parts. This movie suffers two problems, 1. the actting, 2. the emptiness of the film. Now the actting was good at times (mostly from Ironside) but Stephen \\"lacks\\" (huh, I made a funny joke.....laugh damnit) all emotion, I mean half of the time he stares blakly at screen as though he is waiting for someone to say his line and the other half of the time (when he actally speaks) he sounds like a robot.     When I mean emptiness I mean that half way through the film, it was just filled with filler to the point were it felt like he made this up as he went along, like some how the middle of the original script was burnt or somthing and Mr.Cronenberg did not want to wright it again.    This was a good movie with a good story and good special effects but was executed poorly and fell in the middle but shambled back up at the end. This is no where near a great horror movie nor will it ever be but it is a good movie and has been forgoten now a days, which is sad. All in all good movie, I give it a 4 outa 5. This is zombiedude signing out.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I purchased this flashlight holster, and I also have the [[ASIN:B001RQH1EO Maglite XL100 LED Flashlight, Black]].  I have been using this holster and Mag-Lite LED XL100, at work, on a daily basis for almost a year.  The holster has excellent retention in that it holds the flashlight securely, and has not given me the feeling that I am going to lose my flashlight while working.  I have no problem pulling the flashlight from the holster with one hand, nor do I have any trouble placing the light into the holster with one hand.  I will also note the fact that the holster is an ideal length to hold the Mag-Lite LED XL100 securely, and protect almost the entire surface of the flashlight while retained in the holster.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Megadeth, Anthrax and Metallica. I must say th1rt3en is a very, very good album. Nice songs, nice vocals from mr. Mustaine and great instrumental parts. Buy it!!! PS: if you love the bands I mentioned above then you should try TRIVIUM.  TRIVIUM has the same energy and crushing power that Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer used to show thirty years ago!!!
B003I55BIA|4.0|my friend was raving aout this book for such a long time. it was all she would talk about at one point. so i desided to get a sample and try it. although it gave me about fiften pages it was great and i had to buy it immediately. it shows you that you have to work to get anywhere you want to go. with brittany ellis just wanting to be normal and alex just wanting to find his place in life. i hooked on this book and read from noon to about six in the morning the next day. a must read!!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Downloaded fine, crashes at hour glass. Waste of 3 dollars! Play it on kongregate.com for free! Just make a profile.
B003CN4R74|5.0|I don't know what some people are writing about this being bad, dead wrong. This album is different comparing with the others, but in an amazing way, not like the garbage Linkin Park for example. Amy's voice still amazing and their piano parts as always. The new sound of the  guitar is very heavy, i loved it. Some of the sounds remind me Creed. I was worry and unsure to buy this, but man, i don't regret it.
1446301583|5.0|Great pictures and projects.  Sturdy book, instructions are good.  I was definitely surprised at the quality of the book and the projects.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I rate this album five stars just for everything Metallica has done along the last thirty years. Anyway, I don't understand the idea of making an album with Lou Reed. It would have been much more interesting if they have recorded some new songs with the guys from TRIVIUM or even Mastodon. The mix of experience with youth would have been great. Furthermore, bands like TRIVIUM and Mastodon represent the future of metal. And it would have been great to see Metallica joining these young guys!!!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have seen several versions of Persuasion and for me this version is the best.  I hated the 1995 version.  The guy who played the captain was too old and he overacted.  The only version that comes close to this one is the BBC/Masterpiece version from the 70's or 80's (not sure when it was filmed).  The 2007 version was believable and had the right amount of emotion, not overacted.  As for it being close to the book, I have yet to see a movie based on a book that was exactly like the book.  So you shouldn't expect it!!! And with so many versions, they have to do something different. So if you want authentic, read the book!!!
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I have seen a pixely grain problem on many Blu-Rays, so I finally went online to seek a fix. The solution seems to be finding the PS3 video option \\"1080P 24Hz Output (HDMI)\\" and setting it to Off. When I did that, the grain problem went away.   As for the movie itself, it's amazing how real and scary the dinosaurs look. Hard to believe it's almost twenty years old.  One big flaw is the overuse of the theme song, especially during the helicopter ride to the landing pad. A soaring, catchy piece of brassy music played over and over becomes sheer torture.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|This movie was decent. I'm not a movie critic... but I would have to give it a 5/10. I really loved Resident evil 1 and 2. The 3rd one was just ok. If you're wanting to see it for milla jovovich, then it's worth it. She did a great job along with ali larter. The over-all movie plot had a bunch of kinks... renting it would have been a better choice.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|Unlike Potter films 1-6, this digital copy expired on September 13, 2011. They may re-enable it after part 2 comes out, but I highly doubt it. Save yourself a few bucks and get the version of the film that you can play with conventional players.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|My copy of the long awaited \\"Smile\\" album showed up this morning.  My only disappointment was the fact that I waited until this afternoon to pop it into the jukebox.  If this came out on time and beat \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" to the market, I think the Beach Boys would demand even more respect than they've gotten.  I know I was late to appreciate them.  \\"Heroes And Villains\\" has always been one of my favorite songs by them, and this rendition is quite interesting. I think I'll make a Beach Boys 'super-cd', Pet Sounds and Smile back to back on one cd.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has been a great singer/songwriter ever since her first album Thankful. This album is great and especial the deluxe version. And the songs don't sound the same. All the songs are great and gonna listen to it over and over again.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|It's anyone's guess if SMILE would have changed musical history and \\"sure to sell one million units\\" as the Capitol promotion man promised had it been released in 1967.   It might have been a huge hit with critical raves. And who knows what effect it may have had on the Beatles had they heard it months before they finished \\"Sgt. Peppers\\". Or it could have been a disastrous bomb that would have been sneered at by the San Fransisco and UK hippie counterculture and continued to confuse their younger teenage fans who were expecting more songs about summer, girls, fun, cars and surfin'? SMILE might have ultimately spelt the end of the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson's career. Who knows?   As it is in this finally approved form it's a beautiful piece of artistic pop and rock. Melodic, thoughtful, complex, soothing, startling, non-nonsensical, childish and funny, many times all happening within the same song. Like the greatest classical music, SMILE requires a serious sit down and listen approach to comprehend. SMILE is not for the casual Beach Boys and Oldies radio fan. It's far beyond and completely different than anything the group recorded before 1966-7 or afterwards.   If you loved Brian's 2004 version (especially if you saw him perform it live) you will love this since it almost has the same sequence of songs. Yet there's no way that Brian in his older voice and his great touring band could match the beauty of the Beach Boys young crystal-clear voices and the legendary \\"Wrecking Crew\\" studio musicians who played on these original recordings. These recordings were all recorded with \\"warm\\" sounding tube control boards and microphones, analog tape recorders and real echo chambers that digital recording and reverb still can't duplicate.  My only disappointment (along with missing session notes on the 2-CD version, I'd trade the button and poster to have them!) was that the album couldn't be mixed in stereo. Considering the producers and engineers had to work from a wide variety of multi-track masters with vintage mono mixdowns and acetates it would have been a jarring experience (especially on headphones) to hear something in wide stereo suddenly switch to mono. Still the finished mono mix sounds beautiful and also gives it a classic Mid-60's ambiance and feel like the original mono mix of \\"Pet Sounds\\" did.   The backing tracks, stereo mixes and vocal sessions are also a thrill and a lot of fun to dig through. It does take some patience to go through some of them. I may have to buy the complete box set in the future to hear more. Thanks to Brian, \\"The Boys\\" and Capitol for finally releasing these sessions after all these years of rumors, stories, poor sounding bootlegs and many many delays.
B004RFYEEC|1.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan since I was in high school. I have every album and every CD including Brian Wilson's solo release of \\"Smile\\". When the Beach Boys did a concert in Central Park in NYC it was my yellow Oldsmobile convertible that drove Brian to the stage. I heard on the radio this morning (a news station) about the box set release of \\"Smile\\". I am shocked and dismayed that for almost $140.00 there is not a Stereo version of \\"Good Vibrations\\". The Stereo backing track for the single was previously released with the \\"Pet Sounds\\" box set and a number of previously \\"Mono\\"  Beach Boys hits have been re-released in Stereo. In another life I knew John Lennon, who considered \\"Good Vibrations\\" one of his favorite recordings of all time.  WHERE IS THE BEEF? WHERE IS \\"GOOD VIBRATIONS\\" IN STEREO. I would pay $200.00 for a box set that included that! I'm 60 now and I guess it may not happen.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|While the photography and filming of volcanoes, super novas, sunbursts is stunning there is ZERO plot, ZERO sense, and you need anti-nausea tablets so you don't get dizzy from the abrupt changes in camera angle.  Reminds me of Space Odyssey 2001 which was meant to be seen while doing illegal drugs.  Save your money.  This wasn't even worth the rental.
0062011847|4.0|Sam Vimes, the head cop of Discworld's equivalent of the Big Apple, is overdue for a vacation. The book opens just as an intense campaign by Lady Sybil has borne fruit. Sam is forced to climb aboard a coach and head for the relaxing countryside, full of crickets, cows and unhealthy fresh air. Despite his fervent prayers, no emergency occurs to call him back to the city.<br /><br />But where there's a policeman, there will be crime; and a big policeman will find a big crime...and Sam can't help but sense that he's making the country folk nervous.<br /><br />SNUFF is the latest Sam Vimes novel in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. I have loved Sam Vimes from his first appearance in GUARDS GUARDS and therefore it's with a heavy heart I give this book four and not five stars.<br /><br />If you are a diehard Discworld fan, don't let this review stop you from getting this book. Pratchett still serves up a dynamite plot and some of the scenes, particularly Sam with his family, show a deft comedic touch. There's so much here that is still good that it is a treat not to be missed.<br /><br />By the same token, I wouldn't recommend this book to someone unfamiliar with Pratchett's genius. The first is what happened to Sam Vimes in the previous book THUD!. ********&lt;spoiler alert for previous book>********** In THUD, Sam goes toe-to-toe with a supernatural entity known as the Summoning Dark which has an affinity for the worst side of Sam's own personality. In defeating the Dark, Sam locks up his own most evil impulses. The problem with a conflict of this nature is that afterwards, the author has a tough act to follow. Any ordinary criminal or conflict is an anticlimax. So it is here. None of the schemes or criminals in SNUFF is really tough for Sam Vimes. This book lacks the urgency of NIGHTWATCH, THE FIFTH ELEPHANT or JINGO -- those books show Sam Vimes and Pratchett at their best.<br /><br />The main reason this book disturbs me is that the author's style has changed. The tight, neat, CRISP and memorable style of classic Pratchett has turned spongy. Some sentences, even whole paragraphs, lack clarity and meaning. One stops and reads them over and realizes the author is talking around what he means to say without quite finding it. Despite the fact that this plot cries out for tight, driving construction, the author's prose meanders and loses urgency. I hate to see this...Pratchett is my favorite author and Discworld my favorite fantasy location. For 28 years I've enjoyed Pratchett's deft satiric take on the modern world. I've been inspired by his heroic struggle against the early onset Alzheimer's that he was diagnosed with in 2007. Lately, he has been using speech recognition software or dictation to continue writing; I think that might be a factor in the changes that are apparent in his prose. I think diehard fans will enjoy all time we can spend with Sam Vimes and the other great characters of Discworld. Pratchett's still great fun to read and the character's are very funny. Here Pratchett returns to the theme that what we call \\"subhuman\\" might be more human than we think: a very poignant theme which echoes UNSEEN ACADEMICALS. Nothing wrong with the way Pratchett thinks; he still sees more clearly than 100% of politicians.tchett has turned spongy. Some sentences, even whole paragraphs, lack clarity and meaning.

1451648537|5.0|It goes without saying that a book about Steve Jobs has to include a lot of information about computers, etc.  My knowledge in that area is limited, to say the least, but this did not prevent me from enjoying the book immensely.  I appreciated the even-handedness of Mr. Isaacson's prose. Jobs was neither portrayed as a saint or a devil. At the end of the day, while a vessel of extremes, he was human.  He just happened to be a genius too.  I would recommend this book to anyone, including folks in management positions.  Jobs is the kind of story from which we can all learn lessons about what to do and what not to do.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I'm a big fan of Sparks but this book wasn't his best by any means.  Took a long time to really get interesting. His sub-characters (including the ghost)weren't all that believable.  Why all the fighting? To give contrast to the romance?   Then droning on and on--3 chapters at least--about the son's accident.    Just to get to the corny ending.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|Talk about taking revenge of the criminal justice system to a new level, that is basically what this movie is about.  But instead of it being a past defendant who gets out of prison, it is just the opposite, a victim who is upset with the way the system treated his attackers.  Overall the movie was ok in my opinion, got a little bored in the middle of it, yet the beginning and end were quite interesting.  Some graphic bloody scenes which I thought were a little too much and could have done without them.  It's a different type of criminal law movie and I would not compare it to say, A Few Goood Men or The Lincoln Lawyer, but if you like movies about courts and the judicial system, then would think you could enjoy it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I had to tell in the title.. Sorry, but I had to make my point. Ultraviolet digital copy is horrible. You do not want this. If you buy it, you are supporting Ultraviolet. If you don't buy it maybe they will get the idea that the regular digital copy is the best way to go if they want to make money adding digital copies to the discs. Somebody said the UK version will have the regular digital copy. That's what I'm getting provided i can figure out where. If someone knows, say something.
1439102732|5.0|Sometimes I wonder why I keep reading Jodi Picoult's novels. Most are terribly sad, and it's not as if there's not enough misery in the world without facing it in fiction too. But she's a master storyteller, even if some of her novels require some contortions to set the stage for the story to play out.<br /><br />I almost stopped reading \\"Sing You Home\\" after the first two chapters because they're so tragically sad. Fortunately, I continued and came to realize that those first two chapters served mainly to set up the back story for the real story. Good for Picoult for tackling gay rights. It's no doubt not an easy issue to write about so compellingly in fiction, and I don't know if she went overboard in her distaste for those who oppose gay rights. Still, my hope is that people will read this book who need to hear the message - that any two adults who love each other ought to be able to live in peace and with all the rights, freedoms and liberties available to all others.<br /><br />I especially like to think that people like Zoe really exist - a therapist with a magic touch and a superb musician who uses her music to ease the burden of people with serious afflictions.<br /><br />I'll read Picoult's next novel, and then I'll see if I'll stop there. Who am I kidding? No, I won't. I'll read them all. I just hope I won't have to wait too long for the next one.
B000002TWN|5.0|This album is a classic. I will never forget when I saw D'Angleo in the 'Next' section of Vibe Magazine in 1995, I knew he was going to KILL IT and he did. Brown Sugar is an R&B masterpiece and the type of record that comes around once in a lifetime. If you like good music you will like this record.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|After hearing and seeing countless reviews for this show, I decided to plunk my money down and purchase season one. Me and my wife were not disappointed. We are huge horror fans and love most things in this genre, except my wife hates zombie films. Well she loves the Walking Dead and we were both hooked, we started it Saturday night, by Sunday we had watched all of season one and watched episodes 1 and 2 of Season 2 on demand.  Great story line, awesome special fx and makeup. Not since George Romero's cult classic has someone got the Zombie thing so right. Five stars all the way and oh so more enjoyable without commercial breaks, buy it you will not be sorry, just do not watch alone.

Also, was suprised that Grace didnt turn into a warewolf and was cute how even she though she didnt, she still felt like she was part of that world. Love how she always my wolf. Sam and Grace love for each is amazing too. This USA must read, so worth it!

If you are ordering this for a child I'd definitely get the paperback. The hardback was smaller and stiffer than the paper copy but it worked for my purpose. This was my dad's fave book and I remember him reading it to my brother and me. My hope is that I will be pregnant when I give this to him for Christmas so I can tell him that he'll be reading this to his grandbaby soon! Keep your fingers crossed! hehe!

Just like Charlie Bucket, protagonist/narrator Wade Watts grows up in extreme poverty--remember the Bucket family sharing a bed to keep warm?  But through pluck, determination and some help from friends, he finds himself in the running the inherit the empire founded by a reclusive and enigmatic zillionaire.  Of course, rival moguls, not to mention less deserving children, are also competing for the same prize.<br /><br />Roald Dahl's book was written with the memory of the vicious pre-war competition among candy conglomerates (I'm not kidding---go check it out) and post-war rationing still fresh.  But by the mid-1960s, life was looking up for most Britons.  Ready Player One is a post-imperial novel, a novel in which the characters bury themselves away from the deteriorating real world and hope for a job in tech support.<br /><br />Small wonder that James Halliday, the Willy Wonka of this world, hearkens back to his coming-of-age years in the 1980s.  If you've had an experience with that decade, there's something here to make you smile.  But in the end I found the pop culture references slightly unsatisfying.  Yes, \\"Wargames\\" was a great movie...but \\"Bladerunner\\" (which came out a few months before) was much better.  In his blurb, Daniel Wilson compares Ready Player One to the song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\".  But R.E.M's \\"Chronictown\\" EP was released just a few months later (and I believe the single \\"Wolves, Lower\\" was released the same week).  So what do you turn to now from the 1980s?  \\"Wargames\\" or \\"Bladerunner\\"?  \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" or \\"Wolves, Lower\\"?  Which have influenced generations of artists, and which have purely nostalgia value?<br /><br />Ready Player One has its pleasures.  Unlike the passive Charlie Bucket, Wade Watts is clever and resourceful, bringing the skills of a true 21st century survivor to the deadly serious game that happens to be laden with 80s kitsch.  There is a certain satisfaction in seeing throw-away trivia of the era (Family Ties?) invested with, quite literally, life or death significance.  The seeds of Wade's dystopia were planted in the 1980s, so it is fitting to see him navigating his way through its detritus, turned deadly by the passage of time.<br /><br />Read it as a bittersweet love note to the ephemera of a decade that saw the birth of personal computing.  Read it as a Horatio Alger story of the apocalypse.  But, seriously, go read it.  And then listen to \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" and \\"Wolves, Lower\\".  They're both worth at least one more listen from us all.<br /><br />Much of Wade's world was envisioned in 1985 by William Gibson [[ASIN:0441012035 Neuromancer]] a novel which remains astonishingly fresh to this day.
1932735410|5.0|The question that would be asked the most by candidates to Project Management Professional PMP examination would most probably be `How to study for the exam?'  Most would answer 'read the books!'  There are many books that cover the syllabus in the PMBOK Guide; the official guide to taking the PMP examination published by PMI Project Management Institute themselves. Given only one other choice; beside the Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide, of course; that book would be the `PMP Exam Prep 7th Edition' by Rita Mulcahy with Laurie Diethelm.  There are many reasons.  The style of writing is easy and pleasant to the eye.  I could open up the book at any page and could easily understand any of the concepts of Project Management as laid out by PMI.  The approach to the subject adopted by the Book is similar to being in a study group; a thoroughly therapeutic and relaxing way to pick up skills as required by PMI. There are neither stressful moments nor `mountains-to-climb' to cover the syllabus.  I could read the Book and also easily relate the processes, the knowledge areas, the technical jargon to the experience that I went through when running my Projects. There are plenty of those moments when `light-bulbs' popped up in my head whilst going through the book and realizations simultaneously burst out reinforcing that those same scenarios have been experienced by me in my previous Projects.   There are plenty of sample examination questions after each chapter that most accurately imitate the format, the style and the 'quality'; the level of difficulty; of the PMP Examination.  There are tips and pointers on how to study and how best to prepare for the examination. These are practical 'how-to' and wise words from fellow PMPs who have gone through the whole process of 'doing' Projects and then studying to get themselves certified professionally by PMI.  There are topics on `Professional-and-Social-Responsibility', list of References for further readings and plenty of Charts, diagrams and sketches to make the Book a thoroughly enjoyable and refreshing study material. There is also a CD enclosed consisting of the demo version of the renowned PMP exam simulation software.  I would not hesitate to recommend the book to anyone who wants to comprehend PMI's Project Management philosophy and methodology thoroughly, on the way to pass the PMP Examination and be a certified Project Management Professional eventually.
B005EYP8PO|4.0|This re-release of previously available material is a fine collection, but any U2 fan will own all of it.  Most of the additional tracks came off CD5 singles, both imports and domestic, yet there are dozens more that could have been added, the choices here are random at best. Still, if you want a good U2 Achtung Baby experience this is a very good choice without spending $125.00 or $450.00 on the super collectible versions, and you have to ask yourself, do I need a bunch of remixes? This set limits the amount of redundant remixed tracks, where the other more expensive collections do not.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|I had never seen this before, and the movie was fantastic. I didn't know that this was based off of a real story, but I know appreciate the plot more. The quality was amazing. I love Amazon Instant Video. It was a great creation.
1577311523|2.0|I started reading this book after two individuals recommended it to me.  I am finding myself more self-critical,  more anxious, and more judgmental since starting the book.  Today I decided to stop reading it.  Perhaps it is unfair to rate the book given that I will not read the entire book, but I am surprised that so many people think this book is so special.  I just hear the same thing being spoken over and over and over.  Okay, I get it, live in the now.  I like the ideas of dealing with pain bodies and analyzing emotions/reactions.  Perhaps I am not mentally ready for the book.  I may try to read it again at a later date.
1600595871|5.0|There are so many great ideas for types of books here that anybody who's into bookmaking or journaling can find things to get their creative juices flowing. So far I've only made the \\"Guest Book\\" on pages 51-52 because I'm a bit intimidated by the bookmaking process and the time commitments involved. It was tricky to figure out the folds of this one, but I practiced on newspaper and scrap paper until I got the hang of it. Now I can put a little book together in just a few minutes! You can see a video flip-through of it here: [...] . I'm sure I'll be trying many of her other books also.
B004RFYEEC|4.0|The music is 5 star, but I have one little quibble.  I bought all 3 formats (2 CD, 2 LP, big box) because I am just that way.  The double Lp came with nice custom inner sleaves, one of them with the lyrics, but in the big box set, the double Lp has plain paper sleeves. What's up with that?
B0058ZPMYG|5.0|I just finished watching Hesher. Now there are very few things I actually take the time to come on here and write a review about. This movie was 5 star in every imaginable way. I know the critics gave it chilly reviews and people on here were less friendly to it than that. The only explanation is that they plain just didn't get it. It had everything. It was funny, disturbing, dramatic, and made you think. The acting was superb by all involved. And the writing while yes, quite vulgar, was not vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. It had a point to it as it helped to shape the mindset of the character Hesher, and continued to help show the intensifying frustration and grief of the family as time went on. Absolutely destined to be a cult classic. Most movies that have become a cult classics were critically shunned when they first came out, most were brushed off as being offensive or nonsense. It was only later that people would begin to understand the films, and I do believe that this is what will happen with this absolute gem of a film.    So if you are tired of cookie cutter Hollywood movies, and bored to tears of yawn inspiring indie dramas, you should definitely check out Hesher, as it offers something different, something wonderful, and most of all, something that makes you think. Absolutely brilliant, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B005EI86JU|5.0|It is a great way to learn my d7000 in an easy and interesting way... love it and will recommend it to friends.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Not bad. Definitely not as bad as a lot of people are saying. This is not easy listening. It's art rock. And the lyrics just seem random and strange if you don't know the German plays that they are based on. If you want \\"Enter Sandman\\" or \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", this is not for you. There is nothing commercial about it. A lot of the songs seem to go nowhere, but I think that's actually the point. Too many people are dismissing this album after just a listen or two, but it will take multiple listenings to really let it seep in and come to a fair evaluation.
0312330537|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to absolutely everyone. It has a little of everything: politics, drama, romance, detective, action, thriller... Really captivating. It also seems like a useful read for anyone interested in India and Indian culture.   It's a pretty big book, and I'm only half way through it - but I have hard time pulling myself away from it. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|Other reviewers are covering the content and the packaging pretty well.  I will mainly comment on the sound quality of the original albums.  First, Achtung Baby was remastered.  There seems to be some confusion over this, since some reviewers, including those in the music press, claim it wasn't remastered, but that it has only been \\"boosted,\\" \\"tweaked,\\" or \\"polished.\\"  Apparently they do not understand that those changes, however slight, are achieved through remastering.  That said, I do agree that the changes are pretty subtle, and may not equate to \\"remastering\\" as a lot of people understand the term, which is to say, substantial and obvious sonic changes.  To my ears, there is a slight increase in gain and presence in the newer Achtung Baby mastering, but it's nothing revelatory.  Comparing the tracks of the new and old CDs in a wave editor reveals a slight, but definite, increase in overall loudness on the newer version.  Despite that, I have to listen pretty closely to hear the differences.  This is not a put-down of the mastering job done for this release; actually, just the opposite. It's nice to see mastering engineers using some restraint and not fixing what isn't broken.  So often, it seems engineers feel the need to justify their efforts by making substantial changes, regardless of whether or not those changes need to be made.  The original Achtung Baby CD from 1991 already sounded great, which is confirmed by the remastering here.  If forced to choose, I would probably go with the newer mastering, but honestly, I don't think the improvements are significant enough to warrant re-purchasing the album, if your only interest is to get updated sound.  Upon first listening, the new Zooropa CD struck me as sounding identical to the original 1993 CD.  Based solely on those A/B comparisons, I could not tell the difference between the two CDs.  However, viewing the tracks of the old and new CDs in a wave editor reveals some slight differences in certain areas of certain songs, mainly in terms of loudness and dynamics.  In listening to those specific areas, I could hear the differences, but only in those specific areas.  Elsewhere, the tracks sound identical.  Certainly, the differences on Zooropa are more subtle than those on Achtung Baby.  Had I not had a visual aid to show me where the differences are, I would not have noticed them.  I think under normal listening conditions, the differences will be imperceptible to most listeners.  I gave the package four stars, not because it's not outstanding in its own right, but because there is so much here that most fans already own, which nevertheless contributes to the high cost of the set.  As mentioned, the remastering, while good, doesn't really provide much incentive to pony up the cash.  The really good stuff in this set - in particular, the \\"Kindergarten\\" album and the \\"From the Sky Down\\" documentary - is excellent and well worth getting.  It just seems a shame to have to pay for such an expensive - and redundant - package in order to obtain the best of what it has to offer.  While the set is impressive in its scope, I would have been just as happy - happier, actually - with a pared down set that offered the most important content for a lower price.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game should be the template for all Final-Fantasy type games for android.  I spent days playing this on my tablet and literally no android game has sparked so much interest in me.  Graphics are great, gameplay and controls are perfect, and its challenging enough to keep anyone engaged.  I got it on the free app of the day, but I'll be buying more of this company's games for sure.
0062101897|5.0|Just received this book yesterday and it is beautiful to behold!  I love the size and weight of the volume.  The pages are thick and richly colorful.  I flipped through all the whole book (except for the sections on Half-blood Prince and Deathly Hallows since I'm still a couple chapters from finishing the former book and have not read the latter, nor seen either of the movies yet) and loved all the content.  Great book and awesome price!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|people need to open there eyes and think for themselves. instead of following some fairy tale. get a grip people.
B005FVA63A|5.0|I'm not going to get too much into the audio/video content of this set because quite frankly that's not what this particular edition is about.  Sure, if you have all of the singles you have most if not all of the remixes and most die-hard U2 fans already have Zoo TV live from Sydney on DVD - not to mention the videos.  If all you are concerned about is the music and video content, then this set definitely isn't for you.  The \\"Kindergarten\\" disc is an interesting look at the development of some of the songs as is the documentary DVD From the Sky Down, but there are less expensive ways of getting those discs, i.e. the regular \\"Super Deluxe Edition.\\"  What we have here then is an amazingly pieced together collector's box set with all kind of cool and flashy attractions - the Fly sunglasses, buttons, a magnetic tile box, 5 7\\" vinyl singles, Achtung Baby on vinyl, a copy of a fan magazine, lithographs, etc.  This edition is more for you to display, not listen to.  Like the other reviewer said, you can even download the content so you don't wear out your physical CDs.  Sure the packaging may be over-the-top for some, but wasn't that the point of Achtung Baby to begin with?  U2 reinvented themselves after their seemingly holier-than-thou '80s pretentiousness.  Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree are great albums, but like Bono once said their '80s work was never really that sexy.  Once they hit the disco clubs in Europe a whole new chapter began and we as U2 fans were better off for it.  In my opinion this all reached a climax with the vastly underrated Pop album, but that's a different conversation all together.  Just comparing the deluxe editions of Joshua Tree and Unforgettable Fire to this one illustrates the difference in tone between the U2 of the '80s and the U2 of the '90s.  Take it for what it's worth.  Like the Genius of Miles Davis box set from last year which came with a trumpet case, lithograph, t-shirt, and mouth piece, this set is more about presentationthan the content.  If that bothers you, then don't get it.  But if Achtung Baby is one of your favorite albums and you have the means, then you won't be disappointed.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Track-by-Track Review:  1. Brandenburg Gate- Lou intro sounds good. Straight-forward rock and roll tune. Fits the bill for the opener of a musical or play in its emotionally-upbeat repetitiveness, but drags a bit towards the end. 7/10  2. The View- Really liked it before, still do. Lou lyrics/vocals, riff, heaviness, Hetfield chorus, etc.8/10  3. Pumping Blood- Awesome strings intro and Metallica \\"stomping\\" riff. The strings sound really convoluted and evil throughout, like blood being sifted from the body. Lars' drum improvisation sounds cool with electric guitar/bass undertones- and then it kicks into an excellent Hetfield riff...speeding to an intense conclusion. Great track. 9/10  4. Mistress Dread- I really like all the musical background noise you can hear on this track and the previous one. It adds a level of intensity to Metallica's instrumentation. So far, Lou's vocals do not bother me at all. Neither does the repetition of the speed metal riff, with subtle changes midway through. 5:03, great Metallica interlude. 9/10  5. Iced Honey- Another straight-forward rocker. Hetfield's background vocals are more effective on this one. Like any musical/play, you have to have these upbeat mood-breakers. 7.5/10  6. Cheat On Me- Very atmospheric intro- strings, bass, subtle electric guitar, and Lou's vocal delivery. Hetfield comes in sounding like he did for Bridge School Benefit: Garbage- \\"Only Happy When It Rains.\\" Again, I liked the layered instrumentation; it sounds very rich. 10:35, I like this little break. 8/10  7. Frustration- Nice Metallica intro and verse riffs. 2:33, I like the sudden change with squeaking instrumentation, as well as Lars' improvisation. 6:00, I like these emotional outbursts by Lou, then Metallica kicks it back into high gear with Load-ish ('Ain't My Bitch'?), hook riff. 8.5/10  8. Little Dog- More atmospheric Lou vocals with acoustic guitar. His voice sounds very exacerbated in this song; almost tired- fits the mood. 9/10  9. Dragon- GreatMetallica riffage, 2:55. Lou's vocal delivery still isn't bothering me at all; it's actually fitting. Lars using toms and throwing in some effective, double bass. The experimental guitar solo at 5:00 is pretty out there; first time I've really \\"heard\\" Kirk on this album. I should also mention that the lyrics work really well in this song. 9.5/10  10. Junior Dad- Lou sounds like Johnny Cash and I like the spacey, electric guitar work; sounds rather uplifting (along with the strings). 9/10  LULU Album: 8.45/10. Metallica gets a 10/10 for doing this project and stepping out of the box yet again.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I don't know why people aren't liking this album...open your mind and you will dig it..it took me a few listens but it finally clicked...and I agree that \\"Junior Dad\\" goes on for waaaay too long...it could've been a 9 min song but they didn't have to drag it out for an extra 11 min almost....still one of the best this year.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet.  There is no need to review the story lines contained in these 6 movies.  That has been done in the past.  Everyone now knows that Lucas has made further changes to the films - if you aren't aware of it, then google it.  This is what you do NOT know:  How is the audio and video quality of this Blu Ray Release?  Here is the plain and simple answer:  AWESOME  Do I love all of the movies for their content?  No.  Was I completely blown away by the superb audio mix?  YES.  Is the video quality great?  YES.  If you are a fan - even a casual fan - with any kind of decent home theater equipment, then you owe it to yourself to buy this box set.  It is FANTASTIC.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|As a long time Evanescence fan, I can safely say that this album is definitely different from Fallen, The Open Door, and previous works. ...But not exactly in a bad way.  First time I listened to it, I was blown away by Amy's (still) beautiful voice, as well as new heavy guitar, bass, and drums. The songs seemed to blend with each other, all the loud background music sounding alike.  However, the more I listen to it, the more I can differ each song and love them individually.  \\"Sick\\", is this album's \\"creepy song\\" as I call it (ie Fallen's \\"Haunted\\" or Open Door's \\"Snow White Queen\\"), and \\"Secret Door\\" is the soft, soothing song of the album. My favorite song is \\"Lost in Paradise\\"- it's the song that sounds most like the older works.  It has amazing dynamics that go from soft piano and hard bass, and Amy's soft whispering to the loud amazing chorus.  All the other songs are just as good, but those are a few of the highlights.  While this album is different from the others, there's certainly no lack of meaningful lyrics and Amy's powerful (yet delicate) voice. However, one of the downfalls is that there aren't many dynamic differences within the songs, as seen in previous albums- with the exception of \\"Lost in Paradise\\". Most the songs are constantly loud, which isn't necessarily bad, but the songs tend to run together at first.   Just listen to the songs as many times as you need to feel the true strength of this album, and you'll warm up to it if you haven't already.
B002ZG9788|5.0|CLASH OF THE TITANS 2010 was one of the best movies I've seen in years.The bluray and dvd of it is great.When it first came out in the theatres in APR/2010 I went to see it hoping it would be good,(I am a lifelong avid enthusiast of GREEK MYTHOLOGY),and it was even better than I was expecting.When ZEUS stuck HADES with his thunderbolt through PERSEUS' sword,(everyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about) all I could say was WOW! And it was of-course not just that scene, but the whole film was a great fun-filled action packed mythology thrill ride from start to finish. For all those stupid \\"critics\\" and even reviewers who have trashed this movie and said many negative statements about it,I will say I don't know what movie you saw, but this CLASH OF THE TITANS remake was many times better and much more exciting and with much better special-effects than the 1981 original.I saw the original 1981 \\"CLASH\\" as a kid,and many times since, and I do enjoy that one also, and have it also on dvd and I even still have the vhs copy. However this remake is like a roaring lion, compared to the 1981 \\"CLASH\\" which would be in comparison like a house cat. And those  that say the acting or script was no good or no character developement,I was really into the characters.PERSEUS was heroic,IO was beautiful, ZEUS was commanding and the KRAKEN made the harryhausen kraken seem like an old leggo toy figure. If anyone wants more character development go watch a tv soap opera,(the few still left on air).I am eagerly awaiting the MARCH 2012 CLASH OF THE TITANS 2 sequel.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I was a book worm growing up, and the closest I ever got to comics was Archie and Garfield.  But I have been a loyal fan of all of the films ever since Batman in the late 80s.<br /><br />I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Captain America for its good clean image, pro-America plot lines, and real muscle.  Sure, it's fun to see a super hero beating up the bad guys with special powers, but Captain America is all about muscle, pride, and determination.  What more could you want from an American film set during WWII?<br /><br />I loved Chris Evans in Fantastic Four, but was a bit afraid that cocky attitude his characters tend to have on screen would bleed over to this film.  Thankfully it did not.  Chris is the epitomy of that wholesome American loving soldier in looks and attitude.  Good job! I was amazed at the special effects to make him look small in the beginning as Rogers, and immediately had to Google it to see how it was done.<br /><br />If you want to see a good \\"super hero\\" film with lots of real action, but no over the top fake-looking special effects, and just a tad bit of romance, then Captain America is for you.  And its a great lead-in to the Avengers movie due out next Spring!
B005AUWY90|5.0|This arrived fine and was a great movie.  I watched it with my grandchildren.  My Grandson (6) could not wait for me to start it and was glued to it the whole movie.  The only problems is with UPS, they seem to deliver to my area late in the day (evening) and there local center is 15 minutes away.  I am not sure why.  Though that has nothing directly to do with your product.

0743270754|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and although I thought it risked being a bit dry I gave it a go. I was captivated throughout by the fascinating story of Lincoln and his rivals. The intertwining biographies were expertly and accessibly presented by the author. The picture of the political processes of the age reflect the aspects of human nature that drive those who pursue high office and demonstrate the dealmaking that existed throughout history. Still it leaves the reader yearning for an age where principles mattered more the politics and in awe of Lincoln's achievements. I wonder how America would change if this were required reading for all voters.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|As always Matthew McConnehey does not dissapoint us with this movie that has us alternately laughing, and gasping and rapt with attention.
B00601J5CC|5.0|This series is fresh and original. The pilot is actually really good and I am shocked it's on network television because generally, as compared to films, they tend to be watered down. Definitely check out the pilot. The next episode is a little weak but then it picks up again. Just be warned each episode is a cliff hanger! If you like horror movies and drama you will love this.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Well been a few years since 2009's Endgame which was a great album for Megadeth but we are now in 2011 and the new album 13 is here.  Megadeth's 13 is a classic and very typical Megadeth release, Mustaine is writing and playing better then he has in years and Megadeth has the same fire if not more so then when they released Peace Sells or Rust in Peace.  I have been a fan of the  band since 1990 an I can tell you all this is some of the most catchy songs and playing they have ever produced on any album since the mid 90's.  Highlights include \\"Public Enemy Number 1\\" \\"Whose Life is it Anyways\\" \\"We the People\\" and lastly \\"13\\".  Their are some re-recordings here from various bonus tracks from previous albums, demos, and guitar hero games but honestly these songs are FINALLY and notice I say FINALLY complete.  Alot of pure critics may knock Megadeth & Mustaine for using recycled tracks but I don't b.c. the original releases of these tracks were not complete and now they are simple as that hince the reason they are released here plus Dave went into the vault and took care of some unfinished business not to mention Dave didn't want to add filler songs to any Megadeth releases NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL any these songs are not fillers, want to know what they are look at any critics review this subject has been discussed to death in the media !!! Ask yourself this do you want to hear a new complete, solid,Megadeth record or do you want to listen to LULU w/ Metallica being Lou Reed's backup band.  Lulu vs. 13 easy pick 13 is the champ and a must have for any Megadeth fan b.c. it is yet another classic release from a band that has always stayed true to themselves and their fans !

B005IGVYUG|5.0|Tom Waits delivers.  There's some shaky points in the album, but even that is true to all previous albums.  There's a couple gems worth any price.  As for the Limited Deluxe Edition, it's worth a couple bucks extra for the book, and the songs which would likely cost just as much to buy them digitally by themselves.  The book contains only photos and lyrics, though, so don't get your hopes up for any new insights into Tom... we'll have to wait for the next biography.
0393327345|5.0|I had originally watched the movie which is what prompted me to read the book. Now normally I do the reverse of that, but I was young when I watched the movie. This book is a head trip cover to cover. It is amazing. The depth of plot and characters, even knowing kind of what was going on based on the movie didn't remove the suspense of the book at all. This book makes you want to wake up and live. My absolute favorite part is that the book begins with the end of the story. That made for a great head trip. Also, the book really makes you think about life. I would recommend this book to anyone 16 and up because it does have a fair amount of adult content.

B005EYP8PO|5.0|Yes, it's one of the best albums ever recorded. Only U2's Joshua Tree stands next to it by the same artist. And for me, it was and remains a deeply personal record, having been released when I was a freshman in college. I don't think a newer fan can really understand how shocking this record was - how it was the complete opposite of everything U2 stood for, and yet was still them.... But anyway...<br /><br />I'm reading a few complaints from other raters about the packaging. Yes, the hardcover books for the early albums were lush. But this is true to the original release. When Achtung baby first came out it was a softcover that opened up to four pages. It was as visually shocking as it was aurally. The crappy plastic-box release which came soon after was a travesty, robbing decades of fans of some of the best of the album art. Only now is the original vision restored. This is how Achtung Baby is supposed to look. My only packaging complaint is the MAMMOTH and intrusive FBI warning that seems to take up half of one of the pages. U2 didn't even put their own name there, but the FBI needs that much room? A shame.<br /><br />I have recently come across a Canadian copy of this 2-disc set. The FBI warning is gone, and instead you have the artwork which the FBI's threat was covering up. Also, the coloring is better on the Canadian copy. It's lighter, and less blurry. It looks exactly like the album did in 1991. If you have a choice, I'd go for the Canadian version of this product.<br /><br />The album may not have been \\"remastered\\" but it has been tweaked. You will hear things you haven't heard before on both discs. There is one new song on disc 2 \\"Blow Your House Down\\" and most of the B-sides. Yes, they are all amazing songs and if you missed any of them the first time you missed half of the album. Back in 1991 it was common for bands to release almost another album's worth of material as B-sides. It was a part of the experience. When you first heard The Fly, The Lounge Remix and Alex Descends into Hell for a Bottle of Milk (Written for the play A Clockwork Orange 2000) came along with it.<br /><br />If you're considering the one disc, pony up the cash for this edition instead. Of course, the Super-box has A LOT more material if you're really into the album. I won't suggest the Uber to anyone simply because, if you're not already SURE you need the Uber - you don't.<br /><br />Noah Mullette-Gillman<br />Author of Luminous and Ominousll for a Bottle of Milk (Written for the play A Clockwork Orange 2000) came along with it.

0671449028|5.0|My son absolutely loved this book from the very beginning. We have a lot of other books by the author, Sandra Boyton, but for whatever reason, this was and still is one of his very favorites. Of course, I know it by heart and I know he does too. A great book to purchase for your baby!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Horrible album from start to finish. I realize this is not a full Metallica album but this band has clearly lost it's way. The last.....4 albums have confirmed this for most. I've never been a Lou Reed fan but I know his work and this is just garbage. These guys all phoned this one in. Jason Newsted dodged such a bullet.  I honestly don't know who sings worse these days. James or Lou. I really can't get through a whole song without cringing. It's just an embarrassment. That's pretty much it. Don't believe me? Waste your money and second guess later. Metallica won't mind. It seems like money is their focus anyway. It's certainly not quality music anymore.
B005FVA63A|5.0|While I ordered this the first day that it became available for preorder, I am glad that the price dropped by $300 and that Amazon was able to price adjust. I was sure my husband would have been killed me if he saw the original price!  Amazon is great for that, so I am giving them a great review for their price protection and adjustments.  While I was willing to pay the price that this set was orignally set at, the final $400+ is much better!  I will say that the collection is fantastic and filled with some awesome goodies for diehard U2 fans.  I agree with the other reviewers that in that if you are only interested in the music, download it.  This collection is more for the goodies and the physical art than the music which you already mostly have! I am giving it an A++++ review - well worth the money if you love U2.  I played with mine and looked through it for 3 hours, and I'm still not done going through it.  LOVE IT!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|As soon as the sonic arrived (a day early!) I was eager to see what it would be like  Although it may be lightweight, quiet, and plastic,  I love it! (:  The sonic sounds are so fun to play with, and the blue light reminds me of  Eccleston and his adventures with Billie :3  Highly recommended for any Doctor Who fans, and especially for cosplayers!  Or for anyone looking for a fancy pen/flashlight set  Just beware of pointing it directly into people's eyes!
0385732554|4.0|I am so glad I bought this book for it is such a beautiful story. Often, it is hard to judge a book over the internet, even with the 'look within' services provided. And it is hard to find a book for a 12 year old, even if he or she loves reading. My son loved the book and insisted we all read it, as I do now. I think everyone should read it. The story makes so much sense and touches to something that lies in the very midst of our existence. What that is? I am not going to tell you, you must read it for yourself. My sons hopes the story will continue... doesn't that say enough?  Mira
B005KMX866|1.0|I have seen Isaak perform live twice. He can be amusing and somewhat entertaining. He can also be be a dreadful bore. I had hoped this album would jump. It doesn't. His original tunes are derivative and unexciting. There is not a single cover that makes you think or feel that something has been added to the work of the original artist. If you own the originals, you certainly don't need to waste time with this. If you don't own the originals, buy them instead of this.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|What can I say.. I bought this toy and other 4 of the same series for my son but..

The detail level is excellent and it's very fun. I'll be buying the rest of them soon. The only cons I found is the size, I though they'd be a bit bigger and the transforming process could be a little hard to perform to young children without help.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I was so disappointed in his first book and couldn't get through one of his next books. So I was very hesitant to read this one, but heard him speak about how he developed it. So gave it a try and was so pleased.  Once into it at 50%, I had to stay up 1/2 the night to finish it. It is a great story about family and love. Highly recommend it. Would be a great discussion club book.

B005JLN9Z8|2.0|I can appreciate good guitar...if it's not all plagarized....I can appreciate good lyrics....if their not all about potty humor...I can appreciate good vocals...if their good vocals. Steel Panther seems to qualify for all the BAD the 80's had. A song about sex is okay now and then but when EVERY Flipping song is and it's vulgar and its not inuendo's like REAL 80's band had it makes them look like pervs who mock rock. Check out any other NEW band with an 80's sound. Reckless Love, Crazy Lixx, Loud N Nasty, Black Rain. ALL of those bands atleast have seriousness and REAL fun not just mocking a fun time.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an iPhone 3GS which I use as much as an iPod as a phone. Since it is constantly and safely tucked inside my Otterbox, I discovered a problem: the Otterbox does not allow me to use by my Kicker iPod stereo dock. Knowing I couldn't be the only person with this problem, I searched Amazon and came across the CableJive dockStubz. It arrived yesterday and I couldn't wait to use it - and it works perfectly. I no longer have to put my iPhone at risk by removing my Otterbox so I can listen to my favorite music!
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I'm a huge U2 fan and find there is a lot to like and not like about this particular package and rather than complain about this and other versions of the Achtung Baby re-release and the business behind it, I want to focus on what is included.<br /><br />First off, the package really isn't a bad deal from the perspective that you are receiving 10 discs for $125 or less (at least from Amazon).  That comes out to about $12.50 a disc and it is neglecting the packaging.<br /><br />That out of the way, and I think most people who are looking into these re-releases and special editions are big fans of the band and will be most interested in items like the so-called \\"Kindergarten\\" version of the album as well as some of the documentary footage.  I've generally found that there isn't a lot of new stuff here, so the value of the set does go down when you start to think about what your net gain will be in buying this set.<br /><br />All that aside, I find that Achtung Baby is perhaps my favorite U2 album, and even having some of this content as a repeat in my collection, it is worth having again.  The remixes have never been my favorite pieces, but it is nice having an official package for them, and as far as remixes go they are probably the bands best.  There also seem to be some new ones that weren't available before.  Achtung Baby and Zooropa are not remastered as we've seen with previous U2 releases (see the comments for details on this), but it is nice seeing them together, and they are the basis for the release.  The B-Sides disk is a nice compilation of everything released with the AB singles plus a few \\"new\\" songs that are probably a reach out to the older fans, like myself, who might have passed on the set otherwise.  The Kindergarten disk is an interesting \\"demo\\" type remaster of earlier takes on the songs.  I actually enjoyed this disk the most as it is a weird perspective on an album I know and love.<br /><br />The documentary is nice while the remaining DVD's are items that have been around in various formats.<br /><br />The advantages to this package are that everything is included in one nice package.  There isn't a lot of new here, but I do like being able to have it all in one spot.  For new fans, the singles aren't always easy to come by, and the 1990-2000 Greatest Hits package didn't fully package all the B-Sides from the era.  The book is a nice quality product, worthy of coffee table type status, and I'll proudly show it off.<br /><br />The complaints:  There is nothing in the package in terms of track listing that I've found.  Generally it isn't a big deal, but if you want to know the exact remix you are listening to or a new song or b-side, you are going to have to go to the internet.  For the price, this shouldn't have to happen.  The edition includes Zooropa, yet it neglects the B-Sides associated with that album.  I know they were few and not necessarily associated with Achtung Baby, but if Zooropa is going to be in the package so should its b-sides.  The live versions of Bullet the Blue Sky (ZooTV edition) and Love is Blindness from the Stay single were fantastic although I supposed the Sydney DVD does cover that, and the U2 only version of Slow Dancing was left out as well.  Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me also came out of this era and could have arguably been included for completeness.  I would also argue that some the Wild Horses and Even Better than the Real Thing remixes on the B-Sides disk should have been on the remix disks instead.  Last, I also wish they would have thrown in more demo versions of songs in a less produced format.  The old Salome bootleg had some interesting material; some of that went into the Kindergarten disk and others went into the 6 new songs on the B-Sides disk.  I'll admit however, that the full context of those demos was always interesting for appreciating the evolution of Achtung Baby, and the rawer versions from that Bootleg were always entertaining.<br /><br />So, it is abit of a mixed review I give, but ultimately I'd give it the benefit of the doubt with a 4 star rating.  I like having this package, which seems almost worthy of framing, but I feel that a little more care could have been put into making it something truly complete.  I was originally reluctant to get this type of package at over $100, but feel that for all that is included it isn't a bad value.  Ultimately, it is going to depend on how important it is for the fan to get what is new here (documentary, Kindergarten Disk, some new remixes, and 6 \\"new songs\\") and whether it bothers someone that the products may be a repeat.<br /><br />It really is sad that some of these disks weren't made available separately or in a smaller package.t of the doubt with a 4 star rating.

B003CN4R74|5.0|Been following Evanescence since their beginning and this CD is as good as they have ever done. Amy's voice still gives me goose bumps it's so good and strong as ever. The new members fit like they've been together for years. Out of the 12 songs only two are not my style, (alittle slow) but the rest are outstanding. You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD.  UPDATE: I've had this CD for awhile now and need to tell you all that it's outstanding. I have gotten other new CD's, Hinder, Within Temptation, and others but this still blows the others away. Don't pass up this great group.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|First off, I find it odd that at the time I'm writing this review the Kindle edition is not available in the U.S. (I purchased it nearly a year ago for my Kindle in the U.S.).<br /><br />Aside from that, this has been the first time I've tackled a novel of such epic proportions from the size of the novel to the extent of the story and more.  I was never much of a literary type, and I've generally been ignorant when it comes to the great works and authors of the 20th century with the exception of those famous authors every high schooler reads.<br /><br />Now as I approach middle age, I've chosen to tackle works and authors that seem to be accepted or destined to be classics.<br /><br />Shogun was a different type of novel for me in the sense that it is historical fiction set in Japan.  Having been to Japan, I was curious to read this book.  I am not sorry I did.  The beauty of this book is that the story fantastically tells a story about Japan that serves perhaps a greater purpose in relating the culture of the country.  While the setting may be centuries ago, the cultural aspects seem well connected to what I experienced in my own travels.  There is something peaceful in the exotic nature of the Japanese Culture, and this book really sucks one into it.<br /><br />The narrative is fantastic from the point of view of the English ship pilot, Blackthorne.  I'll have to admit that I was surprised to find this character and point of view right from the beginning.  Only knowing the title of the book, I had thought I might have the wrong book even, but once the English ship becomes stranded in Japan, those thoughts vanished.  It then becomes apparent that James Clavell intended Blackthorne in a dual role.  Not only is he the protagonist of the story, he is the link between the Western and Eastern world.  I really felt that as the story progressed and Blackthorne becomes Japanese through his own awareness of the culture, so did I.  It is a story that leaves one feeling accomplished and educated. While the plot itself has its ups and downs be it political corruption, strife, conflict, etc., I felt I achieved something and obtained something from a novel that is not often obtained from the books I've read.<br /><br />As for the Kindle edition... I loved it.  This book is a monster from what I've seen at book stores.  The presentation and editing seem perfect.  I was a bit concerned this would be an OCR'd copy, and it may be, but it is well edited.  There have been some rare typos (I've noticed 2 over the whole book).  My only other complaint is that there are certain words that are italicized repeatedly that feel a little silly (e.g. ninja towards the end of the book), but that may very well have been in the original printings.  The Kindle format kept the size of the novel from being intimidating although I often wish the Kindle itself could hide the progress bar and percentage.  I'm not a fast reader, and it was disheartening at times to spend an hour reading only to find I've gone 1 or 2% on the progress bar.plished and educated.

B005MVIF7M|5.0|I'm a huge Wilco fan and have listened over and over again to my favorite Wilco albums, which are Being There, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Summerteeth.  To be honest, I've enjoyed, but not fallen in love with, the last couple albums and have been waiting for another Wilco album that I would want to listen to over and over again. The Whole Love stacks up to these albums for me. On first listening, I really enjoyed it but wondered if some of the melodies would be too subtle to stick in my head. Well, now its the only thing I am listening to and the subtle songs are so beautiful and catchier than I initially imagined and I do keep hearing them in the back of my mind as I go about my business. And I have to say that the title track, The Whole Love, is a really great fun song that ranks amongst their best songs ever and just makes me feel good when I hear it! I'm not sure for new Wilco fans if they would start with this album, but as a Wilco fan I am really enjoying it and I am happy Wilco created this one.
1936850028|5.0|I just got my copy of Beyond Birkie Fever yesterday... I'm done, i read the last 60 pages at work this morning because i didn't want to wait until 5 or 6 tonight.  This is more than a book for cross country skiiers, i know because i am not one. This book is packed with the lessons learned, and experiences of someone who has found something meaningful and life-changing and pursued it with full force. The lessons transcend even being an endurance athlete. They can be applied to anything you may find worth pursuing in life, which has been truly inspiring.  While it is full of great lessons, literally laugh out loud moments, insightful antecdotes, and revealing personal truths; it goes further than being just a recollection of a personal journey. It makes you the reader evaluate what is truly important and inspires you to re-connect with a lost passion, or continue pursuing a goal you are already working toward.  This is just the shot of personal and spiritual adrenaline i personally needed, and I think it may just do the trick for anyone who picks this up.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I just got the iPhone 4S but was unable to charge or play my iPhone's music through the car radio because my 2005 325xi's Dock Connector is the old 12 volt firewire version.<br /><br />This product did the trick!  It converts the 12 volts to 5 volts used by newer iPhones and iPods for charging.  Its dock connector isn't bulky so you don't need to take your case off to use it.  And there are no charging errors displayed on my iPhone.  This product also features a mini USB port on the side so if you only have an old lighter to USB charger, it will charge your iPhone.<br /><br />I can now play my iPhone's music through the BMW's factory radio and change tracks using the steering wheel controls.  The iPhone isn't locked out like the BMW Dock does with iPods.  However, if you try to select the Music app, there is a white screen that says \\"Accessory Connected.\\"  So you still need to create the BMW1, BMW2, BMW3, etc playlists to make it work.  But, it will play other music apps like Pandora and TuneIn Radio just fine.<br /><br />Not related to this product, but cool functionality. If you have the BMW Bluetooth ULF module, you can pair the iPhone with your car, make phone calls, and talk to Siri through the BMW's stereo and microphone.  If you initiate Siri, it will fade your iPhone's music and Siri will talk through the radio!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have been a big fan of Grisham for years however have felt that some of his more recent books have failed and were not nearly as entertaining as his early books. This book took me back to why I loved reading Grisham's novels. The story was credible, the plot and characters thick, and the ending genuine. Great read (although I am dissapointed by the raising costs of Kindle formatted books)
B004UXUWYM|5.0|This was a pretty good movie. Lot's of laughs from the audience, I would say, said it all. Depp is a young, somewhat New York type that flies down to Puerto Rico to work for a paper. He displays a kind of innocence not knowing what to the expect to find at the newspaper he's gone there to work for. Yes everybody else is a wilder character than he is because they've been there a lot longer and are more in tune with the underworld of the country. He gave the impression that whatever he experienced in New York wasn't anywhere near any type of preparation for what he was about to experience in Puerto Rico.  I've been thrown into situations like this myself and he did exactly what I would have done. You don't wanna piss off the locals or the people you meet because you don't know what they're capable of especially when they display such unbridled, manic behaviors. So Depp played it low key not knowing what to expect. If you want to find out where the footing is, you listen to the rhythm, understand the beat before you join in and Depp didn't know where exactly his footing might end up. You do that if you're not sure of what to do or say next. You don't wanna end up in an alley with a shiv in your back. So you let others take the lead since they seem to know the layout and know what to do and not what to do and who to do it with. He hadn't been there long enough as an explorer to live with the natives and wear the grass skirt.  The supporting cast was much more animated than Depp was but the reasons I gave above is why. You're a guy in a strange country with a whole lot of whacky, crazy people on one side and because you seem 'On The Level' more so than the others on the island, you get invited to play with the rich in a scheme that the ragtag characters at the news paper could never get invited to. That's why the guys at the paper were never invited. If Depp had been a more worn, torn older drunk like the news paper guys he would have never been invited to play with therich and the story would have had to revolve around the newspaper guys ... which in retrospect would have been a great story also. But it wasn't what Hunter wrote. This was more of a story about a guy in the middle trying not to get dragged down to the bottom and going there quickly but wanting to play with the rich without losing his sense of honest play either.  I felt the characters were well divided up from the top of the cream (the rich), to the middle (Depp) and the swill at the bottom (the paper characters). I do have to say Ribisi was great as always. This is an actor that plays a character part so well he'll go down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest character actors along with Steve Buscemi.   This is a movie where everything fit. A young guy who was thrusted into an environment that he didn't really fit into, then the guys who were well worn, wanting out but couldn't find their way out so they just got numb to it all and found ways to cope, to the rich guys going there to find huge profits.  The score was well picked also. Kudos Depp.

C'mon... you know that's going to be good stuff!<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read:<br />The Hunger Games Trilogy<br />The Matched Series<br />The Uglies Series<br />Inside Out Series<br />or<br />Divergent.<br /><br />Pretty much if you're into the romantic dystopian, this book will do it for you. It leaves you craving for more and more and more, and once it's done it almost leaves a depression residue on your brain. I literally ate this book up within 24 hours. Can't wait for the second book in 2012!

B005J29HCQ|5.0|This 2 CD set is outstanding with Excellent Sound quality and great photos and Information. \\"SMILE\\" can not truly be purchased or downloaded by selection of songs (pick and choose) as it is the entire experience of the album which is so tremendous! This album is in Mono with some stereo outtakes and it is a true presentation of creativity that at least matches \\"PEPPER\\"  I think it is slightly better.  I also have the latest PURPLE CHICK release which is in STEREO with Mono Outtakes so I now have everything I ever wanted of the SMILE symphony. A very affordable purchase also! PS: I also purchased the Mamas and Papas first LP on CD in MONO (new)as it is so much more enjoyable in Mono than stereo. So, keep in mind that Mono is a wonderful and much under appreciated format!

0062011847|5.0|This is a wonderful book; I was happy to see many of my old Discworld friends in it.  Some have criticized the amount of \\"poo\\" and the general yuck of the goblin idea of \\"unggue\\", but I did not find the references excessive.  Pratchett IS right about the fascination \\"poo\\" and \\"wee\\" and such have for young kids - especially if their parents are shy about discussing it!  I was pleased with Young Sam's progress.  The character of Lady Sybil unfolds more in every book, and she is a lady well worth knowing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this excursion to the country with its Jane Austen subtext.    One new thing I noticed - I have never seen Pratchett write with such sensitivity about music.  Even Lord Vetinari, who formerly only read music, now seems quite moved.
1439102813|5.0|Although heart-breaking and thus difficult at times to read, this is a worthwhile book for people looking for a greater understanding of the scope of Alzheimer's. It's realistic, and doesn't sugar-coat the strain of the disease on family, yet Alice emerges as a very real human being who can still find meaning and value in life, even as the disease progresses. Excellent (and no doubt difficult) work from Lisa Genova who is able to weave a compelling and moving narrative while educating the reader about an all too common disease. Recommended.
B0050F6JQE|5.0|Ensemble Plus Ultra takes its name from the personal motto of Charles V of Spain - `Further beyond' - which sums up exactly what the Ensemble is doing for this year's 400th anniversary of the death of Tomás Luis de Victoria. Director Michael Noone has made a conscious effort to go beyond what other groups are offering, concentrating on the music which Victoria published after his return to Spain around 1586 and highlighting pieces which survive only in manuscript (often in versions which have never been recorded before) plus some of Victoria's rarely heard works involving plainsong, organ and the participation of wind instruments.  During the course of ten discs, Noone brings us over 90 works spanning virtually Victoria's entire career, from his first publication in 1572 to  his penultimate volume of 1600, and including ten of his 22 Masses, six of his 18 Magnificats, six of his eight polychoral psalms and the complete  Lamentations. Hardly surprisingly, this lot clocks in at well over 11 hours. Lest you think that this sounds distinctly daunting and more like a worthy  scholarly enterprise than an absorbing listen, I'll say now that this box set offers some of the most engaging singing of any of the anniversary  offerings so far this year (I reviewed the first tranche in June). Perhaps Victoria's best-known work today is his six-voice Requiem written for the funeral of King Philip II's sister, the Dowager Empress Maria, in 1603. Noone and his singers don't offer us yet another performance; instead they've  recorded Victoria's earlier four-voice Requiem of 1583. It was a setting of which the composer was evidently very proud, publishing it three times; indeed, in his lifetime it was undoubtedly the better known. Ensemble Plus Ultra delivers it with unhurried dignity, glorious ringing cadences, beautifully clear textures and sculpted phrasing. It may be harmonically less intense and slightly more reserved than the later setting, but considering there are only fourvocal parts, Victoria creates wonderfully rich and varied textures and beautiful long-breathed phrases. This surely can't be the 1583 Requiem's  first recording, but it's the only one available today and a significant reason for buying this collection. Noone also does a splendid rescue job on Victoria's magnificent but often rather maligned Magnificats which have often been overlooked because of their musical style. Victoria generally set alternate verses to polyphony, leaving the remaining verses to be sung to plainchant. So, I suppose because these works aren't pure polyphony they've often been classed as less interesting, which they're certainly not. Noone and his singers ring the changes here by performing these Magnificats in a variety of ways: with alternating plainsong, with alternate verses played on the organ in settings by Victoria's contemporary Antonio de Cabezón, and most colourful of all, mixing voices and wind instruments in the three-choir Magnificat on the Sixth Tone in which all the verses are luxuriously polyphonic. This isn't done on a whim, of course; we know from contemporary accounts that the use of wind instruments to double and sometimes even replace vocal lines was standard practice in Victoria's time, especially on feast days. This is the seventh disc of the set: my favourite because it contains lots of polychoral treats which are set against the backdrop of the Easter Liturgy as celebrated in Madrid around 1600 (so there's plenty of plainsong too). In addition to the Magnificat, there's  also the three-choir psalm Laetatus sum and the Mass based on it, plus a smattering of double- choir works, including the delightfully Spanish-sounding Easter Sequence Victimae paschali. With its attractive refrain (`Dic nobis'), jaunty banter between the two choirs and effervescent climax of unrestrained  `Alleluias', it brings to mind the Spanish villancico - a mainstay of sacred music in the vernacular. Ensemble Plus Ultra and Noone bring just enoughswing  to Victoria's step, especially in the delightful alternations between duple and triple time and in the movement of inner voices during the long luxurious cadences. There's more of this in the double-choir Regina caeli, with its ringing `Alleluia' refrains doubled either by cornet and sackbuts or a chesty organ. Simply gorgeous; and so Spanish.  The single most impressive expression of Victoria's Spanishness greets us on the very first disc of this collection. There's a nice play on words here: the Missa Pro victoria neatly refers to both composer and subject matter - the victory after the battle. This Mass belongs to a long line of so-called Spanish `battle' Masses which were often, like this one, based on Clément Janequin's battle chanson `La guerre'. Victoria may not have written a note of secular music himself but here he really revels in Janequin's lively rhythms and jangling calls to arms - as do the singers, cornet and sackbuts. The performance once again very sensitively combines voices and instruments, and uses an organ to double Choir 1 - Victoria published a separate organ part-book for many of his late Spanish works and thought this a daring touch of modernity. The energy which Noone draws from his singers, especially in the strong chordal writing and triple-time sections which were such an audible feature of Victoria's late style, really shows us Victoria at his most progressive. It's thrilling, and since this is the only recording of the work currently available, yet another reason to snap up this box.  Such was the popularity of Victoria's music both in his own time and during much of the rest of the seventeenth century that it was inevitably taken up by performers and arranged to suit their own resources. One of the most radical transformations his music underwent was the extraction of the top line, which was sung by a solo voice, while a lute, organ or other harmony instrument summarized the remaining polyphony by way of accompaniment. Nooneincludes the first recording of the six-voice motet Vadam et circuibo, arranged in this way by the Italian theorist and singer Giovanni Battista Bovicelli. He published it in his manual for singers in 1594 to teach them how to apply elaborate ornamentation to such vocal lines. The extraordinarily florid results are negotiated here with considerable skill and beguiling calmness by alto Clare Wilkinson. We also get the original motet for comparison.  This is the best value-for-money offering for the Victoria anniversary so far this year. Alongside all the rare repertory there are also plenty of favourites (Vidi speciosam; O magnum mysterium, for example) and I recommend it wholeheartedly, though you may want to digest it gradually. There are full texts and translations, though Noone's booklet note is frustratingly short. The performances are consistently engaging for two reasons: their deliberate avoidance of the precision-engineered, perfectly precise sound of some other British choirs, and a pervading sense of real personal involvement with the music. Victoria was held by his contemporaries to be a joyful composer: in the 11 hours of singing here this is gloriously apparent (Archiv 477 9747, ten discs, 11 hours 18 minutes).  Simon Heighes.

B005UT29Z0|5.0|Having been a wall streeter for most of my professional life I can say that this film gets it right it gets right the firing, it gets right the way in which people are so disconnected, so self serving, it gets the way many young misguided college graduates think of wall street. I started working in the 1990s on wall street at a time when Risk Management meant something and at a time when firms like JP Morgan out of 23 wall was leading risk management with risk metrics and most of us coming out of great Universities with technical degrees were welcomed, albeit heralded as the saviors of the new age of finance. Sadly we believed it and so did the rest of the world including key people in the administration \\"Summers\\" defended our new financial engineering products so much so that even in light of the near collapse of LTCM they said that we had it right. Why do we believe that we can dilute ourselves? Mass delusion I say. And I say it again we must be mass deluded. As an insider working in Private Equity who never lost his job after the financial crisis I have to say three things. One that the movie I just saw is very accurate narrating what did happen,as to which firm it was portrayed in the film? well that I wont say, not because I cant say but because it isnt for me to say but what I can say is that it isnt the obvious one it is not Lehman.  Second is that the movie reflects on something that it is amiss among our society which is the lack of what we call Humanity and common sense. Third is that I totally understand why people feel the way they do about us wall streeters, we have not lived up to the expectations  or rather, we have. Lastly I can say that we all have to live up to a higher standard one where we think of the better choices that we have to make and i hope that this film gets people to thing about what those choices are. No one wants to go home after a long career or a short one feeling that they have just sold their soul or realize that they did a longtime ago. Finance and Econ are important parts or our society The management of limited resources is a key function for our leaders to help us perform and us too. When doing so, we should not over rely on esoteric financially engineered products we should challenge those who structure them to create products that truly benefit us in the long term, and in order to do so we need to think Long term, just as men like Steve Jobs did when he thought about innovation beyond him, hence the title of this review, Long Term Capital Management LLC.

1594203059|5.0|He had the guts to call the Cairo speech \\"touchy feely nonsense\\" in public!  That alone makes Niall an authority on current affairs.    His books are without a doubt a joy to read, each and every one of them.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Casting A+. Acting A...very convincing in some scenes given these kids aren't superstars (yet). Writing A+. Soundtrack A+. Sure there are some things like kids spontaneously knowing lyrics to songs sung for the first time. I won't go into a couple of the other issues that will fly past you unless you see it five or more times like me. This is a movie for all ages. Don't think because it revolves around kids that adults won't get something out of it.   The genius in how the writers endear to you this many characters as well as reconcile some of their most pressing issues in a single 90 minute flick. It never seems forced like they are trying to do too much with the movie in the time they have to do it in. For me, it was brilliant. Best Disney movie for all ages I have ever seen.
B0056BU3I2|2.0|This film is a great example of why discriminating movie buffs could care less if hollywood fell off a cliff. There is absolutely NO TALENT in screen writing these days. These folks seem to think that all we need is a lot of BS stunts and CGI effects and we'll just drop to our knees in praise of them. As one other reviewer clearly observed, the stunts and some of the story line were SO ridiculus until it made the whole story unbelievable and utterly unrealistic. When I'm watching a supposedly non-fiction movie the one thing I absolutely can not stand is to have my intelligence insulted!  This movie does this hands down, so much so until it should receive an honor for its efforts.  In my opinion, Rock, Vin and Tyrese gave the best acting efforts...very matured and natural acting skills. I really like Paul Walker but he should take more acting classes because a lot of his lines sound too artificial...sounds like he forces his delivery too much.  Their ridiculus stunts were too much for me, they borrowed scenes from Clear and Present Danger (the ambush that killed all of Rock's men but curiously kept him alive eventhough he was in the middle of the street with NO protection against rapid gun fire), and, to me, borrowed too much from the Ocean's 11 & 12 themes (with the crew of 7 or 8 guys that all had different specialties, tired). The two Challengers that pulled a bank vault at high speed down the highway was just stupid...no snapped cabled, no rear ends being jerked out, not to mention the overwhelming effect the massive vault-weight would have had on the cars themselves.  It just got dumb at that point.    It was amazing to see that Brazil had Dodge police cars like America...I really didn't know that. I also thought it strange that a DEA task force of 4 or 5 men could come into another country and operate all willy-nilly without ANY cooperation with the hosting country other than one \\"translator\\" that ends up being Vin's love interest at the end credits. I'd like to see some other country come into America and try that!  Anyway, glad I didn't reward hollywood with a box office receipt for this (this is the main reason I don't spend money at the theatres today). There's worst entertainment for sure, but really disappointing for supposedly a solid franchise, and the fact that this movie took in over $640 million worldwide. What does that say about our moviegoers today?!?!  One last thing, fire the director from future projects for putting crap like this out!  Thanks!

B000OP1M6M|5.0|Well I have been researching watches for a good quality automatic that I could use for everyday use as well as diving. The Seiko seems to have fit the bill after I waited for a good price on amazon. The watch was shipped out very quickly and came brand new in the box with all of the plastic protective covering still on. I got the instructions and the warranty book but the Seiko warranty card was missing. Not sure if these watches are grey market and don't come with a warranty, but Amazon appears to offer their own 2 year warranty. Not as good as the 3 year one from Seiko, but at this price I'm not one to balk.<br /><br />The watch itself if beautiful, and I really like the \\"pepsi\\" Seiko colors. The screw down crown was a bit hard to start on it's threads after I set the time. The Lume is amazing and only second to the crazy bright lume of a luminox watch I own. The watch has some weight to it and feels substantial, not a ton but feels of good quality. The face is quite dark blue not bright or royal blue. I have read that some people don't like the Jubilee band, but I thinks its pretty comfortable and sharp looking. So far I've timed it with my iphone and its pretty close for my liking, I'll know more in a few weeks/months etc.<br />The bezel if very smooth out of the box and has 120 detents. I'll post updates on it's reliability since I've just recently purchase it.<br /><br />So far very happy, and am already pondering buying some more Seiko automatics!!

B004ZISVWC|4.0|I've read the other reviews of this film, and while I generally think Norwegian films are less than see-worthy, this one is hopefully the start of a new era in Norwegian film.  The backdrop is drawn heavily from Asbjørnsen and Moe's Collected Norwegian Fairytales, albeit in a very modern world setting. I've heard people complain about \\"it's so unrealistic and it's trampling on christian faith, smelling christian blood is SO unrealistic\\" Well. To all of those who think that's a very free interpretation of the lore, you should seriously try to read some of the aforementioned fairytales. Trolls CAN smell christian mans' blood. And it DO drive them even crazier than normal.  The fairytales comes from an era in Norwegian history aftrer the Viking era, and thus \\"we\\" were \\"christianised\\" for lack of a better word. And as all bad creatures (like vampires, werewolves, etc) hate and distrust symbols and people of the Christian faith, so do trolls. Although, the trolls take it a step fursther with their heightened sense of smell, which allows them to actually smell \\"christian mans' blood.\\"  Now that THAT is explained and now makes sense, the film is very true to the Norwegian Folklore, Otto Jespersen (playing Hans) describes the different kinds of trolls and their habits, their habitats and societies and all such in a quick and easy way to understand. He's actually a comedian in Norway, as well as at least 3 or 4 others of the (minor) cast, but does a very good job in this film.  All in all... when me mrs. said she wanted to see a Norwgian film, I seriosuly didn't expect much. I expected quite a bit of dodgy (at best) dialogue, slightly unfocused cameras, thin storyline with even less plot, and music originating from Norway Worst EuroVision SongContest.  What I got was good dialogue, sharp camera focus (bearing in mind it's supposed to be amateurs handling the camera at all time) good storyline (which every Norwegian knows the background of by heart) with a fair plot, and music that actually fits the film.  I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars, as I think they could've done a slightly better job in fleshing out the different troll tribes and why the government tries so hard to keep the trolls a secret. Also, in quite typical Norwegian film-manner, it lacks a little bit of \\"polish,\\" norwegian film always look very amateur-ish, and this was no exception to that rule. I think Norwegian filmmakers and script writers scould learn a little from BBC and also Hollywood when it comes to the \\"polish\\" of the films, although that's just a very minor point, but as I'm now used to BBC productions of Torchwood, Being Human, Dr. Who, and others, it's very easy to notice. Even though the film is supposed to be made (mostly) by amateur college students, the lack of this \\"polish\\" DO drag the whole experience down. Then again, it might just be because I'm so used to Norwegian film that I cringe every time I hear about one :lol
B004UUKDNA|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic. Every song is interesting, creative, and fun, and I have more than enjoyed listening to the whole cd many times already :)
B005S7GT32|2.0|This album is a re-recording of Peter Gabriel singing his greatest hits, accompanied by an orchestra.  Oh, you'd think that something like that would be spectacular?  Sonically phenomenal?  I thought it would be too.  But alas, the music takes a decidedly minimalist approach and only a handful of musicians play at any given time.  Rather than take advantage of an orchestra's full range of instrument and percussion, the album has so few instruments playing at any one time that you begin to wonder why an orchestra was involved at all.  And the arrangements on San Jacinto not only don't convey the same mood as the original, they don't even play the same arpeggios as on Security.  What could have pushed me back in my seat and weep with emotion, instead simply made me weep.    you owe me ten buck Peter.  I love your work man, and that's why I bought this automatically without listening to it.  But it's the last album of yours I'm going to do that.

I will recommend this book to everyone and I can't wait for another book by this wonderful author.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|The concept album, Lulu, by Lou Reed & Metallica is a \\"creative\\" (and I use that term as loose as Kim Kardashian) effort. I will be positive only in that they tried something...and failed. Some things go together like peanut butter and jelly, however this is more like combining said peanut butter with a whale's hoohah. It's awful.   The problem I have with Metallica is that, unlike other bands and artists, they choose to dilute and debase their heavy-metal brand by creating \\"music\\" (again loose loose loose, here) that is dissimilar from the music that has become their mainstay. Sully Erna, the lead singer for Godsmack (for example), wanted to create a different sound artistically. Did he force the others in Godsmack to play his vision? No. Sully's Avalon is an inspired, yet acquired taste and it is Sully's own. He didn't try to change the band or dilute their name with his experiment. If Metallica wants to create a variety of music, they need to create sideprojects and separate bands. This is what 99% of most bands do who remain successful and true to their sound and their fans.  Lars & James have absolutely no clue as to the mind of their fans and what they like. They don't care. It was clear in Load/ReLoad and St. Anger and it was clear in the Napster debacle. The Rolling Stones have managed to sound the same even while exploring various styles of music, as has Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Would you listen to a Green Day album if they decided to explore Billy Joe's passion for emo polka? But Metallica goes so far, especially in this release.  I am disappointed they put so much time and so much effort into something that is the sonic equivalent of vomit. Death Magnetic was a move in the right direction, but still far from a good album. Thank GOD for bands like Megadeth and Anthrax who still produce relevant, hard rock and metal music and remain a force in Heavy Metal...who remain true to their fans...who remain relevant 30 years later. Metallica could stop making music today. If this is the direction they're going, I wish they would. Metallica brings shame to it's namesake: \\"Metal\\". They should change their name to Spaztica.  If Steve Jobs was all about flawless design and making something people didn't know they really wanted & needed, Metallica is not the Steve Jobs of music. No, they are the Bill Gates of music. Clueless, out of step, stuck in a downward spiral (yet still selling to those who don't know any better) and unable to stop making bad decisions.  Don't buy this album. Please. Buy the new Megadeth album, Th1rt3en, which was curiously released the same day. It is OH SO much better. However, if you like the audio taste of peanut butter and whale hoohah, by all means...indulge yourself and buy Lulu.  Metallica? You should all kick yourselves in the crotch for wasting precious time. You want to experiment, start the James Hetfield Experience or the Lars Project. Stop making a mockery of Metallica.
B004Z4LVZK|2.0|First of all, I want to say that the back cover is the best written part of the book, because it completely hooked me and is the only reason I actually read the whole book to the end. Once I found out all the secrets of the maze and how the character got to his strange predicament, I was left wondering why I ever wasted my time reading the book through. All I know is that I won't be wasting my time with the sequel since the only thing I would have to look forward to (now that all the beans have been spilled) is zombies, fart jokes, akward boy horny-moments and more ridiculously dark and depressing plot.<br /><br />The book itself is not necessarily poorly written and I can't even say that the plot is that bad...unless you aren't a 13 year old boy obsessed with gross jokes, \\"scary monsters\\" that came out of a power ranger movie and cruelty for kicks. If you are not a guy, and you're past the fart jokes this book is not for you.<br />To sum it up: Do I regret reading this book? Yes Will I read the sequel? Heck no!
B00005214X|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD. I had the vinyl back when I was in the military after it first came out. What a masterpiece. It really shows the neglected skill that George Harrison had. His music is complex and his voice, to me, is hynotic. This compares or surpasses any Beatle album and I loved the Beatles. Extra songs on this double is a bonus. I didn't care for some of Harrison's more commercial stuff but this set is his best and if it was all he ever did it would be a great legacy.
0385736002|3.0|This is a Young Adult book that is DEFINATELY for young adults. Being in my mid twenties (ish) I know that instead of complaining abo this book, I should get on with my life and read the \\"serious\\" stuff all the grown ups rave about. That being said, me being an avid reader of YA, sci-fi and fantasy, I was thrilled about this series when I discovered it. So far I have read 4 of the 5 books that are out, and although they are somewhat enjoyable to read, they have way too shallow a plot and half-baked characters that are just blah. The bad guys are childishly evil and the good guys can't seem to make up their mind on why they're good (I think this is the author's bleak attempt at character depth).<br />To sum it up, I gave it 3 stars and not two because I really like what the book is about, and the fact that they are a portal that allow you to travel to a simpler world full of magic and adventure. It's a shame the book is aimed at tweens; had the plot been a bit deeper it would have made for a true keeper.

A very touching and entertaining tribute. Couldn't believe how much his son looked and sounded like him. I even like the Indian music by Ravi Shankar and his daughter. Glad that I have especially now that Billy Preston is no longer with us and he is in the video for most of the concert. Jeff Lynee and Eric Clapton are amazing. The Monty Python part was too long for me (I'm not a big fan of that comedy) but it was a good tribute for George. This DVD really has everything for everybody. Worth having.

I'm writing this without even watching the movie, but I felt compelled to share my opinion of my experience so far. I should not have to join a studio's cloud service or give complete strangers what I consider personal information to download a movie. This seems to be another way to access personal info, shopping, and viewing habits. From now on, if Ultra-violet is the only digital copy available for a movie, I will buy something else.

Hova has always had an outstanding rap game but how much of Hova can you listen to.  At some point you gotta let somebody else have the spotlight and be creative. You get tired of hearing what you got (cars, houses, cash, hoes, etc).  It's good to hear some new refreshing music. Most of the songs are a hit but my favorite is \\"On My Level\\".  I mean dayum, playing that booming in the car is a natural high. He is so under rated.  KEEP IT TAILORED 100.
0312427999|4.0|The givens: Naomi Klein is a lefty (I am decidedly not) and I disagree with some of her stands. Looking at the 5 stars versus the 1 stars, there are some in each camp who are faith-based religionists in the capitalist theory camp and there are those who are just as religious in their opposition. Some say we are in another historic Depression and others vehemently say the US is back to growing.  I was in a position to see how Milton Friedman's theories along with several others (Chicago School, Greenspan, Alfred Kahn) actually changed the way business and life worked in the US. The breakup of AT&T did not benefit anyone but the speculators. Ditto with airline and trucking deregulation. The mortgage industry-Savings & Loan system collapsed. The South American sovereign debt crisis almost collapsed American banking. I saw it all from the inside and it was not anything like the 1 stars try to tell you.  Now let's talk about the book. She got the story basically correct about how other countries were forced to privatize what had been non-profits or government socialist programs. Money owed to US banks became excuses to force open opportunities for US financial exploitation. When Larry Summers and friends went to Russia to set up capitalism, it so ruined the country that it was abandoned. He and the other capitalists then ruined most of the largest universities in the US. They were right there to work their theories and contribute to the financial collapse of 2008-on.   Bottom line: The Shock Doctrine is a peak at the theory behind the actions that caused this mess. Other books discuss the acts that contributed to the debacle. Enough time has passed to check on how the rebuilding after the Thailand tsunami has worked out to see if Klein got the story correct. So far she is very close. That pretty well puts all the arguing to religious fervor. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.   Update: Just read \\"The Chastening\\" which details the IMF and US behind-the-curtain wheelings and dealings during the 1990s Asian and Russian meltdowns. All the characters involved in the US meltdown were key players in these crisis. The secret world of finance is revealed and how those countries were forced to swallow the \\"Shock Doctrine\\". Klein's book shows the after effects on the populace while The Chastening shows that the greedy and corrupt were bailed out.
0062101897|5.0|This book is heavy and very high quality! Got a great deal from Amazon; the price listed on the back cover is $75.00. Was shipped in great packaging and I'm very pleased. This book is too nice to leave sitting on a shelf.
B000V9D5LG|1.0|Workable cheap and inexpensive lens.  Get it if you lack money and find a great deal.  If have some funds or can save them up, wait and save!  Not really as good as it was when it first came out.  Focus seems slower, jumpy, and not spot on in that 'wow-this-is-a-cheap-lens-and-it-I-get-these-great-shots' sort of way as when I first bought it.  The quality has diminished as a result from a person who has owned this lens 3 times (bought when funds were limited, bought a nicer lens and sold, bought again after twins and then bought one last time when I thought I was not going to do any telephoto shootting).  Again, the images are blurrier now and just don't seem to give that surprising super cheap pop.  Just not that good, though, overall.  I would say save up as much as you can and spend $600 if can.  Believe me, I understand if you cannot (life happens, twins are born, bills come in, and the economy hits you).  My personal opinion is that for $200, this has now become a super disappointment when I compared it to the first copy I had.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have an evo and have two printers at home. This app works flawlessly. Does what it is supposed to do. Very easy to set up too.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great fun, particularly for a child of the 80s.  Brought back lots of great (and not so great) memories of pop culture of the period.   A very creative and original idea that inspires thoughtful consideration of the ever increasing culture of online identities and the potential and pitfalls that lie within.  A quick read only because you don't want to put it down.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|I almost didnt watch this movie because the reviews were so mixed, But im very glad I did. It was actually a good movie. I didnt watch the trailer or read what it was about, just went in with an open mind. It takes twists I wasnt expecting, sucked me in rather quick. By half way thru I was wondering where it would go because I thought it was almost over. Now that its over I'm like wow why wouldnt any one watch it. There is not a lot of gore, there is suspence, not alot of spooks, no ghosts, DO NOT THINK burmuda triangle movie if and when you watch it, the name of the boat they sail on is called triange. It will be on my list of movies to watch again!!
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|The music industry is all about capitalizing on what is hot now. In the 80's they wanted to capitalize on the success of bands like Motley Crue, Ratt, Quiet Riot and Def Leppard. So they put out band after band after band each with poofier hair, more spandex, and more bandannas than the last band. There was only one problem...many of those later bands SUCKED!  Eventually, as the 80's were coming to a screeching halt, some freaks from Seattle put out a different sound and the public jumped on it. True to itself, the music industry totally turned their backs on the best selling genre of music from the past decade and began shoveling piles of this new garbage on the unsuspecting public. There was plenty of room for the good metal bands to survive along with this new sound, but you know how record companies are...they can't tell the good music from the bad. They only know sales. They lacked the intelligence to realize their own greed killed the public's taste for new metal bands. All they knew is the old sound stopped selling, and if the public was willing to eat up this new sound they would force feed it to them until the current golden goose dies from obesity.  Many kids fell for the bait and became fans of the whiny, depressing crap called &#34;grunge&#34; that filled the 90's rock scene. Once again, the record companies and their &#34;if some is good, more is better&#34; philosophy continued to shove whinier and whinier bands down the throats of the rock public until the public started to regurgitate. That regurgitation was &#34;Hip Hop&#34;.  Yes, those young rockers who were not emo's on the verge of suicide needed a new sound. Since the record companies almost entirely killed real Metal many turned to hip-hop.  Rap &#34;music&#34;, the noise which most males under the age of 25 considered laughable in the 80's, changed its name to &#34;hip-hop&#34; and immediately became a respected and admired genre of music in the entertainment industry. Yes, gang bangers - atleast some of the ones who survived after shooting each other - now became the idols of millions of kids who would otherwise be listening to great Metal music. Suddenly talentless, tone deaf engineers became ultra-rich &#34;artists&#34; because they could create &#34;music&#34; by programming a beat box hooked up to a computer. If they had the brain power to create 4 measures of a rhythm, they could loop it for 3-1/2 minutes and get a Grammy out of it.  As the end of the world appeared to near, millions felt something was missing musically in their life. That missing piece of their soul came out of the ashes in 2009 as STEEL PANTHER!  STEEL PANTHER is a half-parody of the music that was made famous by great bands bands like Cinderella, Twisted Sister, Skid Row, Great White, and Kiss. I say it is a half-parody. The half that is the parody is the make-up, the costumes, the hair, and the lyrics. The part that is not the parody is the songwriting, the musicianship, the vocal ability, and the attitude.  For the past 20+ years Metal has not been fun. It has been overly serious and/or depressing. STEEL PANTHER brings enjoyment back to metal with some tongue-in-cheek lyrics and some seriously kick-ass music!  These guys are my new favorite band.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I got this album, not because I wanted to, but because I had to. Metallica is my band for life. Love them to death. And when I heard \\"The View\\", I knew I was going to like this album I rate it a 5 because I can't do a 4.85. This album, like every album by everyone, is not flawless. I will admit that Lou's vocals, for the most of the album, suck, but he makes them work in some places. Here are my reviews for each song:  Disc 1:  1. Bradenburg Gate, 4/5: This is my least favorite song on the album. James's \\"small town girl\\" chant is just too cheesy for me. While the guitars are pretty good, I just can't find it in myself to give this song a 5/5.  2. The View, 5/5: Ah, if it isn't the song that the world heard first and shunned the album for. Lou's vocals aren't at their peak here. Yes, it sounds like poetry, as most of Lulu does, but it's not that bad a song. The riffs are good, all three or four of them. This is one of my top five tracks on the album.  3. Pumping Blood, 5/5: Another top five track. While Lou's \\"pumpin' blood\\" chant at the beginning sounds a bit like he's saying \\"pumpkin blugh\\", he makes up for it in lyrical intellect and content. I love the anxiety and anger in this track.  4. Mistress Dread, 4/5:  This is between my seventh and eighth place song. It's a really close race between this song and \\"Cheat on Me\\". It's a thrashy track, not very catchy though. I find it hard to get into this song, but it's still good.  5. Iced Honey, 5/5: The catchiest song on the whole album. I love the \\"iced honey\\" parts of the lyrics. I make this my fifth place song, simply because the top four are far better, in my opinion.  6. Cheat On Me, 4/5: Again, it's a close race between this song and \\"Mistress Dread\\". It's not a bad song by any means, but again, to me, it's not enough to crack the top five.  And so begins Disc 2, where the continuum begins to take over and song lengths increase beyond ten minutes...  7. Frustration, 5/5: I love the odd intro. It's really creepy,like nails on a chalkboard. The lyrics contradicting themselves between hatred and admiration were a good way to go. The riff is pretty catch as well.  8. Little Dog, 4/5: The guitars being 99% acoustic song makes this a bottom three song, not saying I only prefer heavy guitars. It's a nice song, but to me, the riff isn't too good. The lyrics are good, but they're overshadowed by the riff.  9. Dragon, 5/5: I love this song. The riff is great. The lyrics are great. It's aggressive. It's just great.  10. Junior Dad, 5/5: Nineteen minutes and twenty-eight seconds. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the official song length of \\"Junior Dad\\". But don't let that discourage you, this song is a great piece of music. The lyrics are at their peak for the album and, while it drones on for almost twelve minutes to the end of the song after the vocals end, the continuum is absolutely beautiful.  My song rankings (it was really hard to decide the order of the top four):  1. Pumping Blood  2. The View  3. Dragon  4. Junior Dad  5. Iced Honey  6. Frustration  7. Cheat On Me  8. Mistriss Dread  9. Little Dog  10. Bradenburg Gate  Album overall grade (out of 100): 92, A-.  That being said, this album is definately abstract art. It takes someone who appreciates abstract art to love this album.
B00006AUIG|1.0|Short and Sweet...I found myself waiting desperately for something to happen,and it never does. Not scary,not interesting, I really dont get all the hype
B0000019HU|5.0|I consider very few albums perfect.  Spiderland branched off of rock in an entirely new direction, inspiring and informing the huge worlds of what are now called math rock and post rock.  A fun, and simultaneously heartbreaking record.
B003XT603Q|1.0|Curious from reading interviews, commentary and reviews about Murakami, I decided to read one of his works to learn what I had been missing. After meandering through his sophomoric verbiage and scenery I now know.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|It sounds like some jam session tapes that Metallica let Lou Reed recite poetry over - beatnick style. This isn't you're typical 'drivin' in the car' type music but you can kind of appreciate what they're trying to do here. You sort of have to be in the right 'state of mind' while listening to it.   There are some really decent Metallica riffs on there but you'll be doing some waiting between them. There's a lot of sustained notes while Lou Reed basically talks over it and you're just waiting. It is kind of a shame that some of these riffs won't become full fledged Metallica tunes, but you never know. It's not for everyone and it shouldn't really be viewed as a typical commercial album. It would be a more of an accessible album if it were broken up to like 57 tracks instead of 10.  More or less this is a Lou Reed album w/ Metallica as a backing band. James Hetfield sings here and there and you get a few solos from Kirk Hammett. I'll put it to you this way, if you're a Metallica fan and enjoy their albums from the 90's AND can tolerate Lou Reed spoken word albums, give it a try. I'm sure you'll find bits and pieces in there that you'll like. Just mess around with some of the time editing in iTunes.   Oh and I never thought I'd ever hear James Hetfield sing the words \\"Iced Honey.\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great little game. High production value, great sound and fun game-play. If you like puzzle games, pick this one up.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|What more can be said about this album?  This is actually the first copy I've owned for years, so I really can't compare the mastering of this to older versions.   It does sound good, very similar to my Doug Sax 1992 Remasters, Capitol 2004 issues of Animals and The Wall.   I bought this mainly for the Live at The Empire Pool, Wembley, London 1974 disc two.  Both discs sound excellent.  The live disc is worth the money, a totally new perspective on this masterpiece.  Wish I was there.  I have the Wish You Were Here Experience Edition on Pre-order.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I've been a Beach Boys fan since day one and have really looked forward to finally hearing The original 1967 Smile album. Love it!  However on the box set in the 60 page book why are there no session notes for CD 1? It starts with CD 2 through 5 but no #1.  Has anyone else noticed this? Or is that page missing in my book?
0071762345|5.0|For someone who loves Social Media marketing as much as myself, a typical book written by a \\"Social Media Expert\\" (SME) is usually just a good read for me.. I read them just because the topic interests me.  However, Dave Kerpen went above and beyond grabbing my interest.  He uses true life stories and anecdotes that better describe everything that he writes about, and also makes it more interesting to read.  His examples about his traveling, his family, his job, and even his journey of writing THIS book, all help round out every point to where someone who has never heard of Social Media could understand it and be able to start applying it to their business marketing strategy.  Learning from a truly passionate and interesting writer is something that is very rare, but Dave Kerpen delivers flawlessly!!
B005HXGE9G|3.0|I must admit there were several songs on this set I had never heard before, so I am giving the set 3 stars for that reason. The concepts has been done before and it is tricky to get it right.(Sting did). It is like the conductor was more in charge then Peter was. So the set is more focused on the orchestra then Peter. I will most likely never play the second disc again as the songs have almost nothing in common with the orignal version, not just because Peter does not sing. I have heard insrumental version of some of theses songs before and they  were much better then this.    In Your eyes is just wrong, Diggimg the Dirt, Red Rain and Don't give up was very wrong. Wildflower and Darkness was done pretty well but I did not know them before. This will not stop me from buying his next set, but I will sample first.
B00003CXAT|5.0|My 7 year old had never seen this movie before and I had a hard time trying to find it on DVD.  My teenager mentioned trying to find it on Amazon and it didn't take long!  I found it and bought it at once and my younger son is now totally addicted to this movie.  YAY!
B00622DS0E|5.0|I love this show INTENSELY. Park and Adams are solid, appropriate additions to the cast of characters; I was afraid, at first, they'd just be fill-ins for all the missing doctors on House's team. Also, after this episode's treatment of Dr. Park's disciplinary gauntlet, I hope she has a more clearly prominent role even after the return of Taub and Chase. Lastly, Dr. Foreman makes a pretty good \\"Cuddy.\\" There's even some sexual harassment from House against Foreman in this episode - Watch and enjoy.
B005ER6STG|5.0|I do not post reviews often, but when I see multiple incorrect posts on an item that would deter someone from enjoying it I must speak my peace.  The Serbian Film is a great film.  It's not for everyone, but for those who like extreme cinema, chances are you will love it.  The reason I wanted to add my 2 cents is in regards to the infamous cut scenes.  This version is the same version released on Flixfling (which I rented online a while back).  There is only 30 seconds cut on this version spread over two scenes.  I also have seen the original workprint so have seen both versions.  While I agree it is unfortunate it was cut at all, the cuts are very minor and do not take away from the understanding of, or enjoyment of the movie.  This version is the most complete official release with english subs.  The UK version has 49 cuts that total to 4 minutes and the German version has a whopping 16 minutes cut out!  So we are fotunate only to have 30 seconds removed in the end.  Again, I have seen both versions and I bought this bluray.  Each buyer must make their own choice, but this issue has been a bit overblown IMO.
B00008EY9G|2.0|In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.<br /><br />I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a sort of round table court proceedings surely.<br /><br />What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably.
1451648537|4.0|I don't think I will ever be able to read this book cover to cover.  Its reads more like an encyclopedia than a book.  The index in the back could be more complete.  I have looked up relevant parts of his history that I was interested in and found them without too much work.  His writing style is quite good.  Gets to the point without alot of wasted words.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This season is the starting point for the renewed Doctor Who TV program by the BBC, and it's one of the best in my opinion. Christopher Ecclestion gives an excellent performance as the shell-shocked Ninth Doctor, who has just fought in the apocalyptic Time War. This off-camera event essentially resulted in the extinction of his species and thier ancient enemies, the Daleks. So the last Time Lord returns to the Earth he loves, and through the course of the season grows back into the whimsical, capricious, but competent Doctor we all know from previous regenerations. This season has an overreaching story arc, but most episodes are free-standing. One excellent exception is the two parter, \\"The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances\\" which is very scary and creepy, but has one of the best endings. These two episodes also introduce the irrepressible Captain Jack Harkness, played by John Barrowman, who later goes on to be the lead in the Doctor Who spinoff series Torchwood. Billie Piper plays the major companion, Rose Tyler, through Season 1. She brings hope and light to the Doctor through the course of episodes, helping him become himself again.
B000HT386M|5.0|This used DVD had the expected ware of any normally used DVD, other than that it was as good as new. I plan to shop here again.  Thanks for the honest discription.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The book was great, but I felt he end was rushed. That is all I will say, so not to ruin it for the next reader.
0446585025|3.0|I must admit, I was hoping this book was actually going to be a memoir of Ellen's life, especially when she started off the explanation by saying a lot has happened in the past few years that she wanted to share. So I was disappointed that the book wasn't really about Ellen at all, and simply more comedic stand-up routines she was doing. That being said, there were a few things that made me laugh, but if you're a fan of Ellen (I definitely am) I would recommmend getting the audio version--that would really make these routines (chapters) come to life.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence Welsh has always been one of those singers whose talent is found beyond boundaries (no matter where you are musically) and this is more than confirmed in her second album with her band. By far, \\"Lungs\\" was one of my favorite albums back in 2009 when I found it in a record store and I decided to buy it without even really knowing who she really was (I believe the cover of that record and the band's name pushed me to buy it). My impressions couldn't be better about that record and what I always loved about it was the organic vibe around every song (the harp was the instrument I felt in love with in the record). Now, when \\"Ceremonials\\" was announced I was more than excited for the following reasons: 1- I knew without being afraid to be wrong that I was going to like this record as much as I liked \\"Lungs\\"(2008) and, 2-I knew that when Florence and the Machine released their new record, it was going to take an important place in the music scene that people who cares about REAL music builds now.<br /><br />\\"Ceremonials\\" is extremely different from its predecessor. I would say as my main overview that this record has an atmospherical, ambient vibe in the sound that wraps it up. A lot of synths and keyboards, string arrangemnents that are hard to follow (a fact that I loved as much as I loved  Bjork's new record \\"Biophila\\" (2011)for the exact same reasons) and Florence's voice which here is... well, let's just say that a couple of songs almost made me cry and made me sit down with nothing but the deepest admiration to her work and talent coming from such a young girl. Songs like \\"Only if for a night\\", \\"Never let me go\\" and \\"Heartlines\\" are the songs you'll just felt in love with instantly and... \\"Shake it out\\" oh my God!... this song is unbelieveable! The music, the lyrics (simple and intelligent) and Florence's voice match so perfectly on this one that for that reason, so far it's the song that I'm in love with right now. \\"What the water gave me\\" and \\"Seven devils\\" show how serious Welsh takes her work. These songs are not \\"radio friendly\\" per se and still, they are just two of the best in the album. Amazing arrangements and lyrics and, on top of that, Welsh's performance which is superb through the whole record. The rest of the songs are equally great. Each and everyone can fit on your own taste and the ones I admire now might not be the ones you applaud her on the record.<br /><br />Let me rephrase what I said when I posted my review for \\"Lungs\\" two years ago. Back then I said that because of projects like Florence and the Machine there was still future in music and now, with \\"Ceremonials\\" Welsh has just confirmed by thoughts about herself and her band. Welsh is a woman that, despite her young age, has an impressive background on music education and influences that, eventhough I don't really know for sure to mention here, this is so reflected on her music in \\"Lungs\\" and \\"Ceremonials\\". The indie scene from where she came from has been the only one (in my humble opinion) that still delivers very interesting singers and bands nowadays where here in the American continent (especially in the US) this has been long gone since the late 90's maybe.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine is a band that makes the music they really like and, they do it with passion and enthusiasm and Florence Welsh hasn't really been interested in becoming a \\"celebrity\\" (such a dreadful term nowadays) because of that.

B005OC5CLQ|5.0|Scotty's voice comes out of such a young body. It sounds like he's been singing in that deep, rich country voice since he was a toddler. His album is awesome. I'll be listening to him for a long, long time.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
B00005MNP7|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Blondie (other than their 3 biggest hits) and what made me fall in love with Debbie. Chris' brilliant guitar playing. Clem's powerhouse drumming is phenomenal. It's amazing how some of the songs (Shayla especially) seem to boarder an arena rock sound and others seem to reference their punk rock roots. Clever, cool lyrics. Debbie continues to be a force of nature here as well.  \\"Victor\\" has got to be one of THE most underrated Blondie songs. It's is jaw dropping insane. I had to listen to it like 10 times when I heard it, and am still trying to get it. Amazing. I spent a few months on this album before I listened to Parallel Lines for the first time.
B005FVA3LK|5.0|First, let me say that nearly everything I talk about in this review would apply to the \\"Uber\\" edition as well.  The Uber just adds to the experience somewhat by the inclusion of some additional items - but the music/video content (the true heart of this release) remain the same between the versions.  Both this set and the Uber version are for fans of the album.  This is likely obvious on the surface, but it really does go much deeper than that.  Fans of this album likely became fans when it was first released - back when U2 re-invented themselves.  Fans of this album first heard \\"The Fly\\" or \\"Mysterious Ways\\" come from U2 and listened to them with a mixture of genuine shock and delight.  During this first unveiling of the new U2 sound, look, attitude, etc. - U2 fans strapped themselves in for a ride that truly comes once in a generation.  We saw a band we love go away, and then come back stronger and more amazing than any of us could have imagined.  There have been many times I wish I could have gone back and experienced an album, movie, book, etc. for the first time again.  Achtung Baby is one of those albums for me, and this set...  ...this set is the U2 fan's opportunity to go back and experience that first listen all over again.  This is the opportunity to see other sides of the story around the album, to \\"time-travel\\", and to get as close to the moment you had back in 1991 when you first placed the Achtung Baby CD in your stereo (or, in my case, first put the cassette in your car-stereo) and had your mind blown.  This experience kicks off with an amazing book.  No, I haven't had the time to read it completely, but I have leafed through it a number of times and what struck me most was in the images chosen for it.  You've seen similar images from this era before with this band, but not THESE images.  You've seen the shot of Edge in the \\"star pants\\" on the cover, or Bono with the unnamed woman behind him, but you haven't seen the additional shots taken.  This theme goes throughout the book - and puts you in a strange mindset of viewing these images from the standpoint of nostalgia as well as through the eyes of someone who has truly never seen them before.  It's an interesting way to take iconic images that they know U2 fans have seen 1,000's of times, and give them a twist of something new.   This continues into the documentary \\"From the Sky Down\\".  Most of the interviews are new, but they've mixed in older interviews as well.  You've seen some cuts from some of the older interviews from other appearances by U2, but you haven't seen THESE cuts.  These are the parts of those interviews that weren't aired, but were from the same interview.  You recognize the camera angles, the dress, the attitude, and you can almost re-play those other interviews in your head while you're watching this - but they are newer parts (at least to you) of the interview.  This aspect of the documentary, I am convinced, was solely aimed at giving hardcore U2 fans that opportunity to see something both old and new at the same time.     Probably the most impressive thing about the documentary is where they show how the song \\"One\\" came to be - and do it in near real-time with the original tapes from the sessions.  For me, this was fascinating and gave an experience that is as close to being in the room with them while they create what would become not only one of their most amazing songs but - from the standpoint of the documentary - was the point at which their new direction actually started to become a reality and the band began to heal.  On the audio side, I recommend that hardcore fans listen to the \\"Kindergarten\\" disc first.  It's an alternative version of Achtung Baby taken from the original sessions, and showcases each song in their more raw (and sometimes completely different, both lyrically and musically) forms.  Listening to this disc gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard Achtung Baby back in 1991.  It's the album you love, but done differently enough to feel like a completely new listen.  The other CD's you probably already have.  I had most of the tracks - there were some surprises in there - but for the most part, the remaining re-mixes and b-sides have been available before.  Personally, I was victim to having a large number of CD's stolen from me years ago - and these additional tracks were the welcome return of music I had not heard in a long time.  Many of the shows on the other DVD's are things that were on MTV at the time, or released in different forms on VHS.  I had some of them on VHS - and it is nice to now have them on DVD.  Some have lamented the fact that these are not of Blu-Ray - but, honestly, these were on TV back when HD had no meaning.  Even on DVD, you can tell the source material would have gotten no benefit from being on Blu-Ray.    You likely already have the Sydney ZOO TV show as well.  I have seen some complaints about the inclusion of this disc, but I think it's necessary.  This set seems designed to give the complete Achtung Baby experience, specifically to U2 and Achtung Baby fans.  It is also somewhat linear in how it introduces you to it all (if you go from disc 1 to disc 2, etc.), and the album, tour, etc. are all set-up well.  It would seem odd after watching the closing credits of \\"From the Sky Down\\" to NOT have what is arguably the best recording of what many believe is their most mind-blowing tour.  Yes, people who buy this set probably already have it - but there's got to be at least someone who doesn't - and it would be crime to send that person down this path through the set and then, at the end, simply say \\"If you'd like to see how it all ended - buy this other disc!!\\"  I think it needed to be included.  I have 2 complaints:  1.  The Sydney disc in my set will only play on my PC, not my DVD player.  This isn't too bad for me, since I already own it - but for people like those I mentioned above who may not have it, this is not good.  I've read here that it is because the DVD is in PAL format even though it is stamped NTSC.  Whatever the reason, this is blemish on this set.  2.  The MTV Rockumentary cut out the videos from the original VHS.  I had this video on VHS, and it was basically the same movie - however, instead of commercials, it had U2 videos.  I haven't watched the whole thing to see if maybe they end up at the end of it - but I would have rather seen them in their original spots.  The most glaring issue with this is that in the original video, right after the \\"Boy to Achtung Baby\\" section, the video for Even Better That the Real Thing starts.  Now, it just slaps the \\"MTV ROCKUMETARY\\" logo up on the screen, skips the video, and goes on with the interviews.  I liked the original better.  Also, the original had a rare studio video for \\"Until the End of the World\\" that I don't see anywhere else in this set.  I would have liked to have that on DVD as well.  Anyway - this set is a definate must-have for fans of this album.  Casual listeners, etc. would likely be better off getting one of the other versions, as many of the additional items in the Super Deluxe and Uber sets reference things that casual listeners either don't know about or don't care about.  If you are a fan, however, and you want to relive the original release of Achtung Baby and all that was involved with it, you are in for quite a ride with this box.  Enjoy!

B00127RAJY|1.0|I should have listened to all of the negative reviews for this workout.  Instead, I purchased it, thinking I could handle it if the results were losing up to 20 lbs.    First of all, while I am not offended by foul language, I do not find it appropriate to use it in a workout video, whether it is on the lower end of foul or not (she uses the \\"a\\" word in the video).  That seems very unprofessional, in my opinion.    Also, she does not allow for water breaks or rests, and tells you not to take breaks.  While I did not need a water break or rest for this workout, if someone is starting out in their fitness journey, they may need a break and it may be dangerous if they do not stop and need to.  All other fitness videos I own (including more extreme ones like Insanity) tell people to drink water and take breaks if they need to.  She doesn't have a modification for jumping jacks in this video and says that even 400 pound people can do jumping jacks.  If that is the case, then why do all of my other fitness videos I have seen have modifications for jumping jacks?  It makes me wonder if she just didn't know or was too lazy to figure out a modification.  I would think that if a person was 400 pounds, or had a previous knee injury, they would need a modification in order to avoid knee injury, otherwise, why would everyone else make modifications for it?  The workout was not fun at all, and even though it was short, I found it SO hard to stick with it (I can easily do 30, 45, and 55 minute workout videos of other kinds with instructors that actually make it fun and motivate me to push it).  Jillian did not motivate me at all.    I did not get any weight loss results from it, either.

0670022411|5.0|On a recent cruise I took 6 paperbacks with me to read but while visiting the ship's library I walked right up to this book on the shelf. I'd wanted to read it earlier but couldn't bring a hardback with me too. So I checked it out. Harkness creates an amazing world of magic meshed with history; blood feuds with mystery; and surprising revelations on almost every page. Each chapter left me wanting more. There is horror and bloodshed but mixed in with sweetness and love. Even a little humor. I giggled out loud when the witch's cat, who hates everyone, took an immediate liking to the vampire and brought him a mouse in devotion. When he turned it down, saying he wasn't hungry just now, she \\"yowled in frustration and hauled her offering off to the corner where she punished it by batting it between her paws for failing to please Matthew.\\"  And without giving away any surprises, I just loved the Bishop house! What a personality!   This book is worth reading a second time, and even though I was able to read it at the library, I'm going to purchase it, and can hardly wait for her next book.
0446573019|4.0|Admittedly, I came late to the thriller genre. I got hooked on the Camel Club and read all the Baldacci books. I thought there was no one better at this type of story. Then I discovered the Reacher series, which, like Baldacci's work, is can't-put-it-down fabulous. Just two more Reacher books to go before I've read them all. Baldacci and Lee Child are one and two on my favorite author list, in no particular order.  Now, all the books in this genre obviously share a lot of commonalities. If you've read one plot summary on the dust jacket you're pretty close to having read them all. But no other book quite gives us the twin sons from diffrent mothers feel as Zero Day. We have Jack Puller or is it John Reacher and the endless simlarities, right down to the battle scars. Yes, this is a Reacher book in disguise. It's a good book, for sure. But it's Reacher. And I love Reacher books.   So what's the problem? I guess the problem is that as I read this book I have stuck in the back of my mind that what I'm reading, no matter how well done, is a crass attempt to cash in on the Reacher phenomenon. Something Reacher himself would not do. In fact, it's the antithesis of Reacher. Get it?  Good book. Well written. Enjoyable. Thumbs up. But Oliver Stone must be sitting in Lafayette Square with his head in his hands.
B005MYEQ9U|3.0|It is beautiful scenery. Like a Shakespeare drama. Anna was betrayed by her maid. They are both in love with the King Enrico VIII. The king is bored with Anna and wants to get rid of her. Along comes Percy. It is for the king the right opportunity to take action against them. Both are charged of adultery and are imprisoned. In the second part of the opera the maid wants to plead for forgiveness. They sing a beautiful duet. In the end Anna falls in a delusion and thinks of the younger Percy she had known in her youth. The aria of Anna is the best part in the opera. She gets executed with Percy, her brother and Smeton. The opera had beautiful actors. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo plays the king, Anna Netrebko plays the queen, and Elina Garanca plays the maid. The brilliant voice in this opera is Elina Garanca. She had this clear high unique voice you know from her recordings. The other both voices are dominated by a dark voice not so often seen by them. Anna Netrebko had some highlights but Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is very disappointing. His voice is dark like he had a cold.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Wonderful to see what has come to be known as \\"the first music video ever\\". MTV gave director, Richard Lester, just such an award. Of course, the \\"mop tops\\" were in their prime at this time -- Ringo always smiling, John showing hints of the sardonic wit that would later earn him a spot on Nixon's enemy list.  Wonderful production values, digitally restored, with terrific extra features. Worth every penny (lane)!
B003BFTS9K|4.0|Bought this along with a FastenR-3 for my camera strap. I've used it for a few months now and it works as advertised, glides up and down the strap smoothly. The spring mechanism on the carabiner works fine as well. Construction is solid and I trust my 5D mk2 with 70-200 2.8 lens on it (connected to tripod collar). The locking mechanism on the carabiner is also very and easy to lock/unlock. One gripe I do have is that the nickel finish scratches extremely easy, so 1 star off for that. It seems to be purely cosmetic and the unit as a whole unit is still very solid. I do like that the finish of the ConnectR-2 does not scratch the body of my camera. However, I'm not sure if this will still be the case after the nickel finish is all worn off. I will update this review should the carabiner fail or has other problems.

1423140591|5.0|You loved the Olympians series. You were a bit disappointed in Heroes of Olympus, but it had enough of the Riordan/Percy magic that you were happy. Now, we get book two, \\"The Son of Neptune\\".<br /><br />  The good news is that the funny parts are funny, the exciting parts are exciting, and the whole Roman Camp Jupiter works. The transitions back and forth between the Greek and Roman faces of the Gods is handled well. There are some wonderful secondary characters, (Ella the harpy being a good example.) The humor is a little broader in places, but some of it is really laugh-out-loud, which I don't recall being the case in the first series.<br /><br />  But, be warned. This volume is written in alternating third person chapters from the perspectives of Percy, Hazel and Frank. So while Percy is back, his story is not as immediate or compelling in the third person. And, his whole loss of memory thing can start to get old. There's not too much, but close to too much of the tantalizing almost-memory agonizing.<br /><br />  And, Frank is a clumsy oaf with self-confidence issues, and Hazel is guilt ridden over a past dangerous mistake. Again, that gets driven home again and again, and the character angst, which just never seems to let up, often threatens to overwhelm the rest of the story, plot and action.<br /><br />  Because the characters are otherwise generous and brave, because the plot is clever but followable, and because, hey, it's Percy, you will be willing to forgive all of these weaknesses. Just temper your expectations a little.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|\\"The Most Anticipated Album In Rock & Roll History!!!, says the sticker on the box.<br /><br />\\"Really?  Smile is gonna sell?  What market, though?  Who's going to buy it?\\"  Brian Wilson, 2011.<br /><br />A-h-h-h.The great lost album at last.  Who knows what the \\"real\\" album would've sounded like had it been released way back then.  But what's here is mostly fine indeed-even hearing it \\"put together\\" (from about 60 reels of tape) at this late date.  Coming of age in the era of much great music (the mid/late 1960's) I can't help but wonder (selfishly) what this album would've sounded like up against, and with, other fine albums of it's era.  That, and being able to hear \\"Smile\\" (Wilson's original title was \\"Dumb Angel\\" until Van Dyke Parks suggested \\"Smile\\") in the overall context of the 60's-when music was important, exciting, and alive-and so were we.  Hats off, too, to Carl Wilson, Chuck Britz (\\"...like a co-producer but he only got credits for being an engineer.\\"-Brian Wilson), and Dennis Wilson.  Important people who aren't here to hear this beautiful music.<br /><br />I'm glad these recordings have been released-sequenced and all of a piece.  Finally, all the wondering, the curiosity, and the longing to hear Brian Wilson's much talked about masterpiece can be put to rest.  Has it been worth the wait?  Absolutely.  Is this something you (and I) will play over and over again?  Yes.  But, as I wrote above, while it's nice to hear it in the present-even with everything changed (including all of us)), a piece of me (again, selfishly) wishes this wonderful music-in mono-could have been all over the radio (both AM and FM-remember the difference?), back when albums were a very real part of the 60's generation's life (as opposed to \\"lifestyle\\").  The album (even unheard) became part of a certain era and spirit of a generation (and generations after)-it's both part of a certain time, and timeless.<br /><br />  But listening to this album does remind me of those exciting times-and (not to sound \\"snooty\\") if you were lucky enough to have been there, you know what I'm talking about.  From button-down striped shirts to living room sandbox to fire hats-it's all a part of the album.  If for whatever reason you weren't-this collection of tracks will bring back a small piece of what music was about \\"back then\\".  This album is a small (yet important) slice of how music (and albums) represented both the era, and people's views in those long ago times-when anything and everything seemed possible.  This is an example of what all the magic, the excitement was like, when a young (and my) generation believed in music.  \\"Psycodelic Sounds:  Brian Falls Into A Piano\\"-perfect.<br /><br />But, no matter how you came to this album-this is a collection of some of the very finest music the 60's had to offer-listen and be captivated.  \\"Smile\\"/smile-indeed.  Brian Wilson succeeded-in more ways than one with that word.  I will wear my \\"Smile\\" button with great joy (and remembrance).were lucky enough to have been there, you know what I'm talking about.

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Movie lives up to the name, little cheesy, but it made it that much more funny. Twist and turns and ends up a big ball of mushiness. That is somehow enjoyable. I had fun.
0439023521|3.0|**May contain spoilers below**  I liked this book.  I wanted to love it.  I haven't read the other two yet, and maybe it holds up better when considered as a whole instead of just its parts.  The premise is great, very controversial.  It makes you wonder what you would do if you were thrown into an arena with 23 other people, knowing only one of you would survive.  Would you kill another person?  A friend?  A child even?  How would you survive?  How would you cope in that environment?  I really enjoyed all of the lead-up to the games, with the interviews, the training, the reaping.  It is well-organized and flows well, and I found that as I got into it, it was becoming harder and harder to put the book down.  Mrs. Collins does a good job of creating a world that is in such a state of decline.  She does well to not try to over-explain things.  I can understand how, after 74 years, the people are so beaten down and controlled that they just accept the Games without a fight.  What else could they do?  How can they fight such a strong enemy that controls all of the resources?  How else would they be punished if they attempted another rebellion?  The book becomes even better as the games begin and the action intensifies.  It's great discovering what a survivor Katniss is, how all of her hardship and self-reliance has essentially trained her to be the ultimate competitor in the Hunger Games.    I was also intrigued by the strategies of her competition in the arena.  I wouldn't think that such an environment would lead to alliances, since you could never truly trust anybody knowing that only one of you will survive, but it made for some interesting interaction among the group of competitors.  It was an interesting mix of people with varying skills and abilities.  For me, the book started to flag in the last third.  Too much focus was put on the feigned (or is it...) romance between Peeta and a dim-witted Katniss.  Too much time spent looking for shelter, licking wounds, hunting, and fishing.  Ok, she's very resourceful in the wild, we get it.  I wanted more time with her interacting with the other competitors.  That's what it's all about, right?  The story was ripe with opportunity to put Katniss in more controversial situations, but I think Mrs. Collins became scared of her own story and what her own heroine may have been capable of.  Or maybe she was scared of making her unsympathetic.  For example, what if Foxface hadn't eaten the berries - would she have killed her eventually?  What if Rue hadn't been speared - would she have killed her eventually?  What if she had encountered Thresh again, rather than him being conveniently killed off while Katniss was off fake-kissing Peeta?  How would she have handled him?  How would she handle anybody that wasn't a slam-dunk \\"oh yeah, that guy deserves to die!\\"?  Other than fake-double-suicide?    Maybe Mrs. Collins will address more tough situations such as these in her next two books.  I'm betting she's going to dedicate a good portion of time focusing on the love triangle she has worked hard to set up.  Which could be intriguing.  But it wouldn't be anything we haven't all read before.  And then what a waste of a great premise!  There's a lot more I could say about what I liked or didn't like about this book.  Clearly if you like it at all you have to read the rest of the trilogy, which is exactly what I intend to do.  It's definitely a good read and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story continues to unfold in \\"Catching Fire\\".

B005LRWRZ8|2.0|I love Megadeth, but this album is less than great. It's very disenchanting. The songs on TH1RT3EN are more rock than metal, and the lyrics are laughably contrived. I have come to expect more from Megadeth. Great playing doesn't necessarily make for great music. I understand that this album was written and recorded in a fairly short period of time (about three months), but [[ASIN:B0000067YK Liquid Tension Experiment 1]] was written and recorded in less than a week, and is a much better album. Not only are the new songs bad, but the re-recorded versions of Millennium of The Blind, and New World Order are a huge disappointment. Generally songs are re-recorded with intention of improving upon them. Potentially good music has been ruined. Most of it is at lest tolerable, except the last track, which is really annoying. It's all instantly forgettable.
B00003CXB4|1.0|I was not at all happy with this product. I ordered The Lion King because I was always impressed with the graphics and soundtrack. The disks I received had a huge pause in one of the tracks and finally stop playing all together on the first play. I removed it from the player, made sure that it was clean replaced it and it never played correctly. I am not one to send things back because of the hassle but I expect that when I purchase something that it work properly. I did not get a chance to enjoy the movie at all. Money down the drain.

0152023984|4.0|I was glad to find the book for such a good price. The story was one of my favorites growing up in France and I was glad to be able to offer it to my niece who doesn't speak French. I couldn't resist but to read it again before I gave it to her. A wonderful chance to engage into philosophical conversations with children, one of these books that an adult can really share with children since it will speak to both.   My only complaint is about the condition of the book, it didn't look really new, was obviously handled before (finger prints and scratches on the cover, so if it's for a gift...). The packaging was not water proof and it was carelessly left outside unprotected, so the box was a mess, luckily I arrived shortly after it was delivered. If I hadn't the book would have been ruined. That's why I gave 4 stars.
0446618322|4.0|Although this book has a slow start, the rest of the book is fantastic. The characters are well developed by the middle of the book, and you can really get into the characters daily lives and their thoughts. Each chapter is narrated by a different characters point of view, which helps to get an insight of each character. Since the beginning is a bit slow, the ending is rushed quite a bit. Overall this book is great, it just takes some time to get into.

0446547654|1.0|So today I received my Nicholas Sparks book \\"The Best of Me\\". I was so excited because tomorrow is my girlfriends birthday and she loves Nicholas Sparks. When I opened my package everything look just as one would expect. I go to work and come home later to wrap it and as I do this I just happened to flip through the pages and came to a page 131. I should say what was left of the page. I'm not sure what happened but I am missing half of the page. It doesn't even look like it was ripped out by hand, but maybe it happened in the manufacturing part of the process? I was very disappointed after seeing this and my girlfriend would have probably been a little upset if she had seen this first. Not cool Amazon. Way to make me look like a fool and screw up her gift. Hopefully the seller will replace the one i have now or send me a new copy that contains no defects? If nothing else just send me the page I'm missing.

030788743X|5.0|This has already had so much said about it that I probably have nothing to add. I am not a geek or a fan of computer games, but I did kinda grow up in the eighties and I did like Space Invaders, so I did not think I was the target audience for this book - I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />It is set in 2044 where the real world is so poor that most people spend as much of their time possible, just ignoring it. This is done by living in a virtual world on the OASIS. Our hero is Wade Watts, he is still at virtual school on the OASIS living outside of Ohio in a `stack'. A stack is a futuristic trailer park for when we run out of fuel. The trailers are all piled into stacks to save space and the need for travel as no one save the mega rich can afford fuel anymore. Wade lives through his on line avatar `Parcival', he has no real friends and life is just below tolerable with his nasty aunt. She took him in when his mother died ostensibly to steal his food credits.<br /><br />Then the inventor of the OASIS dies and announces in his will he has left an `Easter Egg' somewhere in the OASIS virtual world; whom so ever finds it first gets to own the multi billion dollar biggest game on the planet. There is also an ISP firm called the IOI, who want to take control and charge for the previously, free access, thus ruining the lives of most users. They own near on everything else, having their own security and prisons or `indenturtements', and are not a nice bunch at all. To get to the `Egg' you wil have to complete a number of tasks and pass through three `Gates'.<br /><br />Wade then starts to try to find the first gate and the action is on, as IOI and all the other egg hunters or `gunters' are doing the same. Author Ernest Cline writes with love and passion about his favourite time (the Eighties) and his favourite pass time, computer games and all associated paraphernalia including music.<br /><br />He describes a world that could happen and a virtual world that is probably a logical step from where we are today. There is nothing I don't like about this book, it is going to be made into a film and unless its as good as `Gone With The Wind', it ain't gonna be a patch on this. Even if you are not a computer geek there is something here for you. I found it just totally engrossing and wanted it to carry on for at least another hundred or so pages. Also, as I am not a geek I learnt an awful lot about things I had no idea  about however, I was fine with the Monty Python references. I can not recommend highly enough - spoil yourself and read this.today.

B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This is one of the best blu-ray transfers that Disney has come out with yet. The picture and sound was top notch with the effects and sourround stage immersive and quite possibly the best use of 3D since the release of Avatar. Those expecting a \\"wow\\" 3D effect will be disappointed, the 3D for this movie is to create an immersive effect not have things jump out at you because they can. The best use of 3D in the film is the opening sequence, Stampede sequence, Simba running through thorns, adult Simba running through undergrowth and the Scar fight sequence. Highly recommended for anyones collection.

B0055SWM08|3.0|Enjoyable game with a nice progression of difficulty. Good graphics and normally runs well on my Samsung Epic 4G Touch. However, it has lately begun to have forced restarts in the middle of a game. Very annoying.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor is one of the best deals out there at the moment.   The performance is outstanding ESPECIALLY for it's price.  If you are looking into a processor that can play any game out today on ultra settings for a good price, then this is the one.  Don't listen to the Intel fanboys and their unapproval, it's just in their heads.  Like I said, this processor can play any game out on max settings assuming you have an adequate graphics card. It is a night and day difference from the one i replaced.  The only thing is the TDP wattage, which exceeds many standard motherboards. You can use this processor in a 65W TDP mobo, but I'm currently investing in a 140W TDP mobo in order to support it better. The main worry about this is the MOSFETs overheating due to inadequate capacitance.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Another great record from the mighty Megadeth. A must have all for all metal heads. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I saw the public television performance of this CD and had to have it.  It didn't disappoint.  Who knew the lead actor of House was also such a talented musician?  I played it 4 times the 1st week.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Great movie.  This is a classic that is not taught in high schools.  America needs the education of the past.
0439023521|3.0|I agree with other reviewers that the basic premise of the book is a bit flawed, but it is very entertaining, although somewhat simple-minded. As I was reading I was yearning for something that would set my gears grinding, but most of the book is pretty much what it is without any additional themes, symbology, theories or subplots that would get you thinking, not enough substance for a second reading. The idea the writer focuses on is whether by surviving, are you giving up your identity/freedom. This was pretty much the only theme of the book. I disagree with other reviewers that didn't like the ending. I actually loved it because the last couple of lines of dialogue leave you thinking. However, this book is very reminiscent of Ender's Game, which in my opinion was much better. To all of those who hail this book as a masterpiece, I urge you to read Ender's Game and reconsider.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Overall, this was a good purchase, but I will probably only use half of it. The USB adapter will most likely never get used. I don't need to hook up my camera to my iPad2 when I can just insert the SD card into the card adapter. Not sure if I could have gotten it alone.  Anyway, the card adapter worked fine, and made it easy to download photos from the card to the iPad. I am a little concerned that it won't work as well, or at all, when my husband upgrades it to the new iOS. We'll see...
B005J29HCQ|3.0|I picked up the long awaited Smile sessions after work yesterday. I don't know what I was expecting but I'm somewhat disappointed. Any Beach Boys fan has heard Smile in pieces over the years, whether it's through bootlegs or the 30 minutes from the 1991 Good Vibrations set. This set simply puts those pieces together and adds a few sound bits to tighten the whole mix. For something as highly anticipated as this, I was hoping for more outtakes or maybe a slightly different cut of Good Vibrations (they have like 40 hours of takes right?). \\"Barnyard\\" borrows from the previously bootleg released versions and the vocals from the piano demo that was released on the Hawthorne, CA compilation in the early 2000's (which has already been done before by the way). I was hoping for an upgraded quality \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" however, it's about the same quality as the bootleg version with some treble added. \\"Surf's Up\\" contains vocals from the classic Brian Wilson demo and the Carl Wilson version which is fine and expected. Everything else pretty much sticks to the blueprint which has been laid out for years. The bonus disc is filled with previously released stuff from over the years. Nothing special. After hearing many bootlegs of this record over the years, I can say I've also heard more creative track sequencing.  If you're a true fan, you're gonna pick this up. If you're a casual fan, this isn't really a set I'd recommend.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Hands down the best checkers app for Android. CPU is actually challenging and hard to beat on higher difficulty levels.
B005HZXUSM|5.0|VNV Nation is easily one of my top five favorite bands of all time. Been a fan for a decade now. I have loved every album they have released. I first heard their new album Automatic online a few weeks prior to the release of the actual album back in late September, I decided to wait to get an actual copy of the new VNV Nation album Automatic. Once again VNV did not disappoint this long time fan. I love the soaring melodies, inspiring lyrics, and the energetic dance beats. The only track that has left me being unimpressed with is \\"Control\\". I like the beats but the melodies just falls flat for me. The rest of the album though is a lot of fun. Automatic is definitely going to be in my top 10 list of best of 2011.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I own all the albums by Coldplay and I feel this one is the best one yet.  I have listened to it from start to finish several times everyday since I've owned it.  Each song flows smoothly from one to the next with no desire to fast forward.<br /><br />Mylo and Xyloto in my imagination are two fictional lovers who represent the hopes and dreams of today's youth.  They are the voice of the many who are disenchanted with this world and wish for a kind of change that would better suit their dreams and visions of how life should be (HURTS LIKE HEAVEN, US AGAINST THE WORLD, and UP IN FLAMES.)  On their journey through life some young people encounter bullies and creators of fear;(CHARLIE BROWN, PRINCESS OF CHINA, and DON'T LET IT BREAK YOUR HEART;) causing them to become disillusioned (U.F.O.) They begin to believe that no matter what they do or where they go someone or something will get in the way and cause them to fail. Someone is watching you.(MAJOR MINUS.) They are the meek ones who wish to inherit the earth and fulfill their desire for freedom of fantasy and imagination.  They want to feel the protection and guidance of their better angels as they set out in pursuit of a better world in which to live (EVERY TEARDROP IS A WATERFALL and UP WITH THE BIRDS.)<br /><br />I have read many of the negative customer reviews of this album and I feel that I must be listening to something totally different than those who dislike it.  One reviewer said listening to the album gave him diarrhea - really? For me; listening to this album continues to provide a wonderful and imaginative musical experience.  I highly recommend it.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|It's remarkable to me how consistent Florence and the Machine is with the band's repertoire of songs. There are no fillers on either this album or her first album, \\"Lungs.\\" Ceremonials keeps up the intensity, passion and creativity of the first record. The songs have great hooks and the arrangements continue to complement Florence's fantastic singing voice. I don't think fans will be let down by this album.
B002VPEAOE|5.0|I love Kate Morton's books and would never buy at a store when the value is so great with Amazon.  Quality without loosing the shirt off my back.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|It has been a long time since I've enjoyed music as much as this!  I had no idea \\"House\\" was such a musician!  I play it for hours and never tire of it!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|There is nothing redeeming about this collection of work. I call it work, not songs, because there's no flow to anything. I seriously didn't think they could release something worse than St. Anger, but here it is. The bands media promotion of this junk is confusing when they say this is one of the best things they've ever done. Why couldn't they have collaborated with someone like Lemmy?
0670022411|3.0|(Contains spoilers!) I loved the book at first, but as it went on, it became more and more flawed, culminating in the \\"non-ending\\" that so many reviewers have complained about. The book suffers from what I call the \\"too toos.\\" It has too too much of everything. I found it ridiculous that Diana had every witch power anyone ever heard of AND that she's a blended twin AND that she had manage to resist any morsel of magic until the book's beginning AND that she grew up in a house that is full of ghosts and is itself a living magical character. Matthew and Diana's cross-species love wasn't enough to battle? They also had to have the Convergence AND the Knights of Lazarus?<br /><br />Besides the \\"too toos\\" another disappointment was how Matthew's character wilted as the book went along. Initially, he was powerful, dangerous, and sexy but by the time he landed in Diana's ancestral home, he'd became nothing more than a glorified babysitter: a kitten rather than a tiger. And that's the problem with the book overall: Like Matthew, it started strong but ended weak.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|It just didn't interest me much. Dave's singing isn't bad, but it stays in a very narrow range the entire album. I didn't feel much depth or creativity on any of the songs either. None of the riffs ever really stood out as amazing.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love zombie movies. I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact. The gritty survival, the black humor, the gory deaths...what's not to love?<br /><br />And among zombie movies, 'Shaun of the Dead' stands out from the shambling, rotting crowd.<br /><br />It's funny, it's got characters that you can identify with, it's funny, it's cleverly written, it's funny, it's scary, it's funny, it has surprising depth...and did I mention that it's funny?<br /><br />'Shaun of the Dead' does a neat trick - it follows the conventions and tropes of the zombie movie almost perfectly, at the same time as it parodies those conventions. It's a movie in nearly pitch-perfect balance of comedy and drama, never taking itself too seriously, but never going off the deep end for laughs. It can scare you, it can make you laugh, it can gross you out, and it can make you care about the people in it.<br /><br />The titular Shaun is one of those people, a very average person having a bad day, who is completely shocked to find himself in the middle of the zombie (don't use the zed-word!) apocalypse in suburban London. His girlfriend has dumped him and his mother is married to a man who he can't connect with and his friend Ed doesn't bring much to the table other than a pretty good impression of a movie orangutan. In other words, Shaun is in every way an ordinary person who is thrust into an extraordinary situation when the dead begin to rise.<br /><br />This is where the clever parts come in. The advent of the undead (which the audience knows is coming, of course) is done with great subtlety and worked into Shaun's story well. The fact that he barely notices as the evidence of the creeping horde mounts just adds to both the scares and the laughs. Several running jokes, physical comedy, and lots of funny side trips await as the story progresses.<br /><br />The point is that zombie movies, for many like me, are something of a guilty pleasure. 'Shaun of the Dead' is that rare one, though, a zombie movie so smartly-made that you don't have to hide it. 'Shaun of the Dead' is one you can take home to your girlfriend and watch together.ead' is one you can take home to your girlfriend and watch together.

B00005V0X5|4.0|The godfather of thrash metal made his belated debut in mid 1985 with the emergence of a new band, Megadeth' and the fastest metal that the world had yet seen. Much has been written and said about Dave Mustaine's short career with Metallica and how his unceremonial firing from that band led him to forming his new one and the band that he would be most synonymous with.  `Killing Is My Business' was the Mustanian answer to initial success of James and Lars as Dave planned to outdo his former partners in terms of sheer rifferey. I find `Killing' to be as enjoyable as the later Megadeth LPs though it may seem a tad unsophisticated and naïve compared to `Peace Sells' or `Rust in Peace'.  Favorites include \\"Mechanix\\" which of course is the hyper-speeded version of Metallica's \\"The Four Horsemen\\", but with entirely different lyrics. \\"Rattlehead\\" would give birth to Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead and of course would be the record's (and the band's) mission statement. \\"Loved to Deth\\" and \\"The Skull Beneath the Skin\\" are just awesome metal tunes as well. I hate the version of \\"These Boots\\" on the remaster - it is borderline pointless with all the vocal edits. Anyhow, Megadeth's debut blasted away the competition and gave notice that the next phase of metal would be led by a highly combustible guitarist with a Metallica sized chip on his shoulder.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This project or whatever you want to call it had me laughing in tears. If this was suppose to be a comedy album of some sort, easily 5 stars as I laughed throughout the whole thing. But since this is suppose to be a serious album, 1 star, and that is being generous cause I cant give 1 star. Come on, I am sure that had to be someone involved in the recording process that said \\"you know, this sucks\\".  To perfectly sum it up from someone elses review \\"This sounds like a start up garage band who hire an elderly man with dementia to be the frontman\\"
B003UESJJC|2.0|The transfer is quite good and the added scenes are interesting (but I see why they were left out of the original cut).  However the ending was completely changed.  I understand that the ending would be changed in the \\"Redux\\" version, but even the \\"Original\\" version was altered.  I bought this disk thinking I would get a new version and if I didn't like it I could go back to the classic, but no such luck.  The new version has a few interesting points, but I think highly dilutes the original film's power.  It \\"humanizes\\" Captain Willard (Sheen's character), but I think that was one of the critical elements of the original film, he is meant to be distant, inscrutable and harsh.  The added footage in the \\"Redux\\" version ruins the character development of Captain Willard.  The altering of the ending in the \\"Original\\" version is just unforgivable in my opinion.

1609611543|5.0|After reading this, I have completely given up wheat in all its forms. Once you read it you ought to be inspired to do the same. It has been several weeks since I have been abstaining and I have lost weight without trying, sleeping sounder and my blood pressure was much lower when I checked it yesterday. The best thing is that my appetite is dramatically decrease because apparently wheat's astonishingly high glycemic properties  plays havoc with one's blood sugar.<br /><br />The author, who is a cardiologist, writes in a very understandable and persuasive manner.  He uses a mixture of scientific fact and personal antedotes to make his point about how wheat has been genetically modified in such a way as to bring about a variety of ills upon its consumers. I found it shocking and disturbing to say the least but as a sufferer of an autoimmune disease, I took heart that I can cure myself through this simple diet. He also includes a variety of great recipes. I have taken it upon myself to start making crustless cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Cake, both of which I have consumed during the five pound weight loss.<br /><br />This book is a great companion piece to Gary Taubes \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and to Dr. Wolfgang Lutz's \\"Life Without Bread.\\" Buy it today, is  one of the most important books for your well-being you will ever read!! PS, I have given up all wheat and gluten products for five months now and my UC is much improved. And it has really helped some of the other auto-immune flares ups I was experiencing!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I read in other reviews how small this flash is, but was still surprised by its minuscule dimensions when I actually had it in my hands.  While I definitely prefer to shoot flashless at f1.8, I've found it can be quite difficult to capture moving objects (particularly children) without a flash.  With this puppy, I at least can bounce the flash instead of having to use the direct pop-up flash (which results in quite harsh lighting).  The lack of head swivel is less than ideal, but bouncing off a wall can work surprisingly well with this flash so still works well with the camera in portrait orientation under many circumstances.  The recycle time is also seems quite good - from a relatively short range, the flash was often able to handle taking 2 shots back to back in burst mode.  If shot from a bit further (requiring more light), second shot may have no flash, but the recharge time was usually just a couple seconds.  Love this little flash so far, and look forward to getting to use it more!
B005K8QIS0|5.0|Apparently Jason Isaacs ( [[ASIN:B005OCFGTO Harry Potter: The Complete Collection Years 1-7]]) had already recorded the audio books of Kate Atkinson's mystery novels \\"Case Histories\\",\\"One Good Turn\\", and \\"When Will There Be Good News?\\" when he was tapped to star in the BBC series. Obviously portraying all the characters in the book gave him an intimate knowledge of his character and it shows in his delicately nuanced portrayal of tough former soldier and policeman turned private investigator Jackson Brodie.  Although he is catnip to the ladies, nonetheless Jackson is haunted by a past family tragedy, and struggles with varied degrees of success to balance his personal and professional life.<br /><br />The three episodes deal with variations of the same theme of him coming to the rescue of the bereaved, the lost and the dysfunctional residents of Edinburgh, Scotland.  Thie series is shot on location, and has a great supporting cast of both veterans and new faces. The haunting soundtrack features Iris Dement, Robert Plant & Allison Kraus, Mary Gauthier, Lucinda Williams and Nanci Guthier among others. This series has subject matter that is rather explicit in nature and several scenes which require the very fit Isaacs to be bare chested so if you have young ones it may require parental guidance.<br /><br />So if you like the mystery genre, Kate Atkinson writings or admire the sorely underused Isaacs, here is a real treat for you!

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Metallica and Lou Reed surprised a lot of people when they announced earlier this year that they would be collaborating on a new album. The fruits of their labor bore the simply and oddly titled new CD \\"LuLu.\\" The songs were inspired from German playwright Frank Wedekind's theatrical work of the same name.<br /><br />This is an album that will probably appeal more to fans of The Velvet Underground/Lou Reed than fans of Metallica. Imagine a more experimental/Avant-garde spoken-word Reed song, like \\"The Black Angel's Death Song,\\" \\"Sister Ray,\\" or \\"The Murder Mystery\\" with Metallica providing ambient metal as the background music. Sound cool? Or does does it sound like garbage? Your impression of \\"LuLu\\" will depend on what your expectations are. You can say that about any album, but it's more of the case here. I love The Velvet Underground and most of Lou Reed's solo work. I enjoyed his Edger Allen Poe spoken-word disc \\"The Raven\\" (2003) and so I liked what I heard here. If, however, you are more of a metal-head and are looking for another \\"Master of Puppets\\" (1986), \\"Metallica\\" (1991) or \\"Death Magnetic\\" (2008) you may be sorely disappointed with this album. One of the few tracks that I can see getting some airplay is \\"Iced Honey,\\" which shows that Reed still possesses his pop craftsmanship, and sounds great with Metallica's muscle.<br /><br />\\"LuLu\\" is most certainly going to be an acquired taste. I personally love this collaboration. I think it's ballsy, unique, bold and captivating. Metallica and Reed sound great together, and it's great to hear Hetfield's snarling background vocals over Reed's signature dead-pan technique. One can criticize \\"LuLu\\" for sounding \\"repetitive,\\" but this really isn't commercial rock made to receive airplay; rather, it's a more reflective, low-key, contemplative album.  \\"LuLu\\" may be radically different from most of Metallica's prior works, but I encourage you to keep an open-mind, although it might still not be your cup-of-tea.

B005J29HCQ|3.0|Having listened to countless bootleg versions of SMiLE over the years, I am convinced that the love this album gets isn't due to the music itself, but is due to the fact that it was never released nor completed. A few things should be pointed out: First, in its now-official form, the album runs the length of an LP-and-a-half. Had it been released in 1967, it would have been cut by a third, or else the band would have had to press on and add even more material--highly unlikely, and which may have made it a better or worse album. So, whatever your opinion of what \\"would have been\\", the official release ain't what \\"would have been\\".  Second, as two LPs or one LP, and with all the additional recording and mixing (not to mention marketing) that still needed to be done, the album would not have been released until the end of 1967 at the earliest. At that point, there was a big backlash against the psychedelic scene (see: \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\"). If it had come out then, it almost inevitably would have been called overlong, pretentious, meandering, and a letdown in the footsteps of \\"Pet Sounds\\"--which, really, it is. There's some good tracks here and there: Heroes and Villains, Vega-tables, and, of course, Good Vibrations are all standouts. Surf's Up is a pretty ballad, Wind Chimes is quite charming, and the opening prayer is a nice touch. But the rest is middling, tossed-off, and forgettable. Tracks like Child Is Father of the Man, Love To Say Dada, and Cabin Essence really don't hold up and, frankly, are kind of annoying. Finished and unfinished tracks like Holidays, Wonderful, and Mrs. O'Leary's Cow are pointless filler that don't go anywhere.   1967 was a landmark year, birthing a number of landmark albums, but SMiLE doesn't stand out as the leader of the pack. As much as many reviewers want it to be, SMiLE is no Sgt. Pepper, Are You Experienced, or Piper At The Gates of Dawn. Even Country Joe & The Fish's \\"Electric Music For The Mind and Body\\", as much of aperiod piece as it is, stands head and shoulders above SMiLE. A better comparison is to Jefferson Airplane's \\"After Bathing At Baxter's\\". Like SMiLE, it, too, is based on \\"suites\\" instead of songs and, like SMiLE, it has just as many lowlights as highlights. Both are ambitious, and both have their moments, but, ultimately, both don't succeed altogether in what they set out to do. The big difference between the reputation of the two is that \\"After Bathing At Baxter's\\" was released way back when, and SMiLE wasn't.  Not to say SMiLE is a totally worthless album. Its highlights merit repeat listening, and the link tracks are weirdly endearing, although, as mentioned before, much of this material would have been cut had it been released as a single LP back in 1967. So, take this release for what it is. The official SMiLE isn't much different from all the bootlegs we've heard over the years, and like most of them, it's even mixed in mono. And, like those bootlegs, the official version is a lot more hype than it is substance. But it is weird, and I like weird pop music. As far as Beach Boys albums go, it's one of the best, for what that's worth. Whatever your take on it, one thing is for sure: its unofficial status made this odd but underwhelming album into the legend it is. And after all these years, it's nice to have it on the shelves instead of behind the counter.

B002SRQ214|5.0|In terms of price/performance ratio, for under $150, this is the best processor you can get. Hell, this is probably the best processor you can get right now unless you are doing hardcore rendering or serious computation. It is very good for gaming. I have yet to play a game that maxes out the CPU usage (DiRT 3 and F1 2011 come close, but those engines just seem to make the processor do too much work without really doing anything useful).<br /><br />It is incredibly fast (I got 52GFlops in IntelBurnTest [Linpack] using 4GB of memory with the processor OC'd to 4GHz @ 1.4675v). I didn't bench it at stock because I really didn't see a point. If you're buying this processor, it's either for the value or for the overclockability, and most people buy it for the latter reason. It is possible to run at 4GHz at a lower voltage, but the reason I had to run mine so high is given below in the cons.<br /><br />As a sidenote: If you are going to use IBT, please make sure your cooling is good. You'll see temperatures ~5 degrees higher in IBT than in Prime95 at full stress. I only touched 60c when it was a little warm in my room.<br /><br />The only cons I can see are the weak memory controller and low thermal threshold. I have 16GB of RAM that I had to downclock to 1333MHz because AMD's memory controllers just don't like large amounts of RAM, and like it even less when you have that RAM at a high clock (The controller likes fast timing more than higher clocks). The RAM I have is RipjawsX 1600MHz 9-9-9-24 in case you're wondering. It's currently running at 7-7-7-21 and 1333MHz @ ~1.5v. At stock clocks though, the processor can handle the RAM at its recommended settings just fine, so there are no worries for people not overclocking. With only 8GB of RAM installed and with the recommended clock and timings, I can run the 4GHz OC at 1.45v just fine.<br /><br />The max temperature before the processor throttles is just over 60c (From what I've read. I haven't tested it myself because I don't want to damage the chip) which is extremely low in my opinion. Intels Sandy Bridge line apparently only throttles at above 80c, with safe temperatures 70-80c range.extremely low in my opinion. Intels Sandy Bridge line apparently only throttles at above 80c, with safe temperatures 70-80c range.

Yes, I did laugh maybe twice (I musta been tired at the time) but really....I now know why she's giving it away on her show....anyway, I'll still watch her but I doubt if I'll ever purchase anything written by her again.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|1976....I will always remember this time....senior in High School in  N.W. Indiana ..Hearing Boston on the radio, \\"More Than A Feeling\\"..over and over. Everyone I knew (who mattered) had this album. Played the heck out it. Numerous songs on the album hit the airwaves in my town. Got the CD when they were made...Got the Re-Master. More Than A Feeling was the theme song at Clark's Prom in 1977  When I hear it played still today....I still think of Leann S!!!!!. It probably was used at many High Schools.  Still Great Classic ROCK today.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm a twihard so I loved the ending. Meyers tied up all the loose ends. I'm dying to see the movie now! I've enjoyed the books more, but the midnight showings have been a fun way to participate in this crazy obsession of Twilight! There is a book I just finished reading Fairytale Farms that I'm hoping to like as well as the Twilight series! (It has major potential and if you haven't read it, you're missing out!)
B00457X7XQ|3.0|This book was on an interesting topic that we'll continue to see more of in the future. The author has some credibility on the technical side, which is always a positive. However, I had a few issues with the story:  - the topic was interesting and timely, but the plot wasn't executed very well. What would normally lead to some sort of ending that tied things together into a satisfactory conclusion didn't take place. There wasn't a typical conclusion, which would be OK if the ending was satisfying in some other way. In this case it wasn't.  - the ending seemed to be highly dependent upon some very unlikely coincidences. The chances of them happening in reality would be zero.  - the writing was very pedestrian. It's sort of jarring to be moving between somewhat complex narrative related to the technical aspects of the story to the non-tech portions, which were seemingly dumbed-down to about an 8th grade reading level.  Again, the topic was interesting and the book was readable, but it was far from perfect.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson gives us an amazing look into the life of one of the greatest innovators of our time.  It is worth the read perhaps as much for its insight into Jobs (early in his adult life, he often walked barefoot, even to interviews and sales meetings) as it is for the history on some of the technology that has shaped our lives.  The tech titans, and their founders, that played a key role in Jobs' rise to greatness ranged from Hewlett Packard to Atari to Microsoft.  It has been noted elsewhere that Jobs was a difficult manager, to put it nicely. But Isaacson gives us many, many examples of Jobs' short-tempered dealings with colleagues and employees, painting his personality as downright nasty and villainous. Jobs was nice to some people, but mean to most. One of the underlying themes, and head-scratching questions, about his life is this: Why was Steve Jobs such an a-hole?  Isaacson gives Jobs' response to the question, and the author also tries to answer it himself. Isaacson's view goes against Jobs' insistence that it's just who he was and he couldn't change it.  Isaacson wrote that Jobs was secretly developing the iPad well before the iPhone, but shifted gears after he realized the phone project was far more important.   The book had its fair share of funny moments, including references to Jobs' body odor each time a new character was introduced, up until the early 1980s. Jobs showered only once a week, believing his diet of fruits and vegetables meant he didn't need deodorant. Complaints about his stench led Atari executives to banish him to the night shift when he worked there as an engineer.  Toward the end, Isaacson writes that Jobs wasn't exceptionally smart, but was a genius, leading to one of my favorite lines: \\"More than anyone else of his time, he made products that were completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors.\\"
B005COO1X6|5.0|Mile 81 is Stephen King of old returned, a  classic best.  Normal kid with normal thoughts, normal town, normal day .... one abnormal creepy thing enters the scene.  Just that one creepy thing off kilter but it's enough to make for a delightfully creepy read.  Not a lot of philosophical or psychological studies to cloud a great story. It's not the King of Desperation or The Regulators, it's the King of Christine, Cujo, The Stand, and the Shining that I've missed.

0071762345|5.0|David Kerpen has focused on the what is arguably facebook's most powerful function with regards to communication and marketing--likeability--extensions of which are appearing now on other platforms as well as on over two millions websites and counting. 'Likeability' functionally transforms the entire Internet into a social space, where individuals assert preference and where that preference is a means by which others learn about interests, communities, products, and brands. Naturally, it is worthwhile for organizations and marketers to harness this functionality as a means of tracking consumer preference, to appeal to a connected and (social)media-savvy marketplace, and most importantly to powerfully promote products across social networks augmented and amplified by word of mouth marketing, and by relying on the ways which \\"liking\\" something builds trust among peers.  Kerpen has written an excellent guide that seeks to answer the question \\"But how do I become likeable?\\" The book is a guide in the true sense of the word, but it is also a workbook with recommended activities and guiding questions that individuals or teams can use to make the book actionable.   He strongly underscores the importance of listening in the world of social media. This includes identifying target markets and the spaces where they interact with one another to discuss preferences, and taking time to listen in to conversations before jumping in. Customers will know that an organization is listening effectively when that organization is able to respond to comments, both positive and negative (and he offers excellent guidance when it comes to responding to comments), and to offer appropriate, meaningful, interesting, and valuable content over social networks. Kerpen also reminds organizations that they must think like their consumers in order to generate the right kind of content to be likeable. In a useful example, he shows how businesses like The Pampered Chef create online spaces that seemingly have little to do with the products they sell, but are able to create communities that seek out their products or services. It's a great reminder that community-building is an essential aspect of social media communications and marketing, one which I personally feel is ignored in most discussions of social media.  One of the most interesting suggestions Kerpen makes is with regards to identifying micro audiences. He creatively uses targeted facebook ads to reach specific audiences by narrowing the criteria so sharply that the result may be only a handful of people, or even one person. He also provides useful examples for connecting with target audiences over LinkedIn and Twitter.  Overall, I highly recommend the book for the way it presents clear, interesting examples of what works and what doesn't work that easily relate to my own projects. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and activities suggested at the end of each chapter, and find that they make his lessons immediately actionable. Likeable social media feels to me like the only book I need on my social media shelf--likeable indeed!

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I always get excited when a new Nicholas Sparks book comes out, but this one is a big disappointment.  The story was generic and the ending was very predictable.  It definetly doesn't live up to the other books he has written.

B004H73W48|5.0|This book makes you want to set out on your own adventure and find something that makes you happy. Wandering around the world is suddenly interesting to me and makes me want to take charge in my life and find something new. Starting a new beginning is always a tough task being a woman because you have appearance and acceptance to think about. Eat Pray Love, makes you forget about your negative life, puts you in someone elses shoes and shows you how one moan dealt with it. It is very inspirational and makes you think twice about your decisions.
0307472841|3.0|I really loved the first 1/4 of this book... it was stark and bleak and mysterious and the protagonist was interesting... and then the scene switched to the fate of the Chinese brothers... their time in the U.S. and the whole slew of characters in China. The transition in content and style was just too abrupt... and whereas the scenes set in Sweden had a brisk, understated, stark (there's that word again) realism and surrealism to them... the \\"Chinese\\" scenes felt 1-dimensional, cartoon-character-like... just didn't work.<br /><br /> To top it off, there were too many times where the protagonist (the Swedish judge) behaved in ways that--even for Scandinavians--were not believable. For example, not telling her friend or husband that she had been assaulted... simply absurd. Yes, Scandinavians are famously reticent and reluctant to express emotion, but her \\"holding back\\"  was just silly--and served only to feebly attempt to make an implausible plot somewhat more plausible.<br /><br />So, alas. A tale that started out as gripping, fascinating, and dark degenerated into a disjointed and superficial mystery requiring too much suspension of disbelief and--in the \\"political\\" sections where the protagonist's fascination with Maoist communism was expostulated--became simply boring.<br /><br />Three stars for the great start... and the fact that the plot overall--however clumsily carried out--was unusual and interesting. Shame that it fizzled.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Oh my god I cannot imagine how bad this actually was until I listened to the whole thing.  Let me start off by saying I love Metallica. Their music defines me. But this abomination is unbelievable. It's like waking up from a very very long dream and not quite realizing you're actually awaken.  Wow. I'm gonna have to listen to this garbage at least one more time to truly appreciate what an atrocious curse this is. Thanks Lou Reed for ruining the music that made me who I am today.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I saw the PBS special and learned for the first time that Hugh Laurie is a first rate musician.  His technique at the piano is top flight.  His knowledge of the genre reminds me of Wynton Marsalis talking about jazz.  One can't pay a compliment much higher than that comparison.  When the special was broadcast I enjoyed watching Hugh Laurie's hands on the piano keyboard.  I really miss this in the CD.  The entire concert is available online, but I have no way to take that to my home theater, and, even if I were able to do that, the compressed sound would disappoint.  Really nice CD and a welcome addition to my collection.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I don't remember the last time tears came to my eyes from the sheer beauty of the music. Yes, I loved Brian Wilson's reconstructed version, but a tribute band is not The Beach Boys, and Wilson's voice is beyond beautiful. Thank you to everyone who brought this together!

030746363X|5.0|I loved this book. It was such a different approach to what i have preciously read.  The author has used himself as a Guinea-Pig and tested first hand all of the unorthodox methods described, and with fantastic results.  This is real practical advice, and unlike traditional nutrition and diet books, this has tested methods.  It is not just a how-to guide, it was a really good read as the author explains a lot of the back story behind his methods and how he came up with them.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Despite the last one being horrible and Temple of Doom getting mixed reviews, these movies are groudnbreaking.  Raiders is one of the greatest films of all time that mixes humor and action masterfully with a great historical backdrop.  One of the few movies to actually do this better, in my opinion, is Last Crusade.  I love these movies.  I don't have much to review because I am not sure if a human exists that has not seen at least one of these films.  My only concern about this amazon page is that the customer pictures are of BluRays when  a) The item is DVD format  b) I don't even think the BluRays are out

B004RFYEEC|5.0|If you are of a certain age you remember the constant back and forth over whether or not the Smile album would see the light of day. When I think back to 1967 I can still envision Brian Wilson wearing his fireman's hat sitting in his tent built over a large sandbox. Pet Sounds went where no rock album had ever gone before: a marriage of sweetly melodic pop with the ethos of classical music's creativity and expansiveness. But Smile was an entirely different vision. We'd been prepared for it by watching Brian on a program televised by CBS about the state of contemporary music sing a haunting Surf's Up accompanied only by his piano. The song was so stunning in its mixture of otherworldly melodic beauty and lyrical poetry that the idea of an entire album of such beauty was like a glimpse of eternity.<br /><br />But it never happened. What we now possess is a glimpse - only the barest glimmer - of the original album. Time has eroded some of the original impact of the music. And the album was never completed so the result is fragmentary at best. Nevertheless, so much of what made Brian Wilson's genius for crafting pop music that was touched by magic and rare beauty is in evidence on this 5 CD/2 LP palimpsest of the original Smile. Especially noteworthy are the tracks that reveal how both Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villains were assembled like building blocks. The way that Surf's Up seems to unfold like a symphonic piece as its orchestral parts are assembled. How Wilson envisioned that the various songs would ebb and flow across the entire album like a wave that only he could hear at first. These moments are priceless. If you've waited for this album for 44 years or if you love the Beach Boys because of the joy they bring, this box set is a must to own. It is an echo but it is still music of the rarest beauty and absolutely unique!<br /><br />Mike Birman
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|First of all; this is NOT a Metallica album. It's a Lou Reed album. All the lyrics and music are based on songs written by Lou Reed. I totally understand all the negative reviews from Metallica Fans. You have to be a Lou Reed fan to actually like this album. Metallica just happens to be Lou's band on this album. I happen to be a Lou Reed fan as well. I don't think it's a great album, but I think there is some good music here, and I think Metallica does a great job as the band. So, then again; if you are a just a Metallica fan, you will probably hate this. But, if you are a Lou Reed fan and a Metallica fan, you may or may not like it. You can't compare this album to Death Magnetic or any other Metallica album, that's just crazy.

B005WY8YZW|4.0|I was in love with the first Album. To me, the first album was very mystical and a very innovative album, in fact, it was one of the craziest albums I think I have ever heard. It had some very odd elements that stood out and I loved the way Maynard changed his voice on almost every song. It was very unique that way.  With the second album \\"conditions of my parole\\", I had very high expectations. I originally thought to myself, \\"my goodness, another Puscifer album is what I need in life\\". When it came to listening to this album the first time, I imagined some very unique and non-traditional sounds would come out of it like the first album. Boy was I wrong, this album sounds very similar to earlier A Perfect Circle and just random jitter Maynard came up with in a closed room. I originally thought it would grow on me, and don't get me wrong, there are a few very imaginitive songs on the album like \\"The Rapture\\" and \\"Oceans\\", however, anyone expecting it to sound anything like the first album, prepare to be dissapointed. The only song that I listened to on this cd that sounds anything like the first album is \\"Man Overboard\\". Which is a great song, but it left me wanting more.   Unfortunately, for me... a few songs don't justify the purchase of this album. I loved the original album, I think it may have even changed my life. As much as I try to like this cd and have it grow on me, for some reason, it isn't really growing on me. All in all, it almsot sounds like this is a prequel to something bigger, but I doubt it, it's just a side project for Maynard. I hope they come out with another remix album that make these songs more awesome.  ::UPDATE:: After re-reading my original review and taking a deeper and more pro-found look at this album, I was a bit pre-mature on my feeling's for it. I have changed my review from a 2-star rating to 4-stars. I think the album has grown on me a bit more and should definitely be considered for maynard enthusiasts and even just regular tool/a perfect circle fans. I was too quick to knock this album, but now that I understand it more. I believe it's a great album, still not as good as his first, but good enough.
B005LBF7CY|3.0|The first half of this book is narrated to you convincing you that everything is perfect and loved. Every time the plot would pick up the pace a bit it would fizzle. Finally the last half of the book redeems itself slightly. I wish D.S. would expand her vocabulary to include other words beside perfect and love or loved. When the word Love is used no less than four times in a single short page it becomes redundant. This book had great possibilities but, for me, it fell short.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|In my opinion it was the drugs that killed this project and Brian's fragile psyche. BUT, as they say, a piece of art is never really finished anyway. It's just at some point the artist decides to stop working on it. What's important here really is the music anyway. This is music of extraordinary depth and brilliance. Actually this is as good as any music ever made by humans. The angelic and well trained voices of the young Beach Boys were the perfect match for Brian's spiritual and harmonic creations. And I love how this gem comes floating along against the backdrop of such a dreary and shallow music scene as we have now. This music has everything that music lacks today: heart, soul, beauty, love, spirituality, insight, courage, pain, joy and more. In other words, all the qualities that make life the wonder that it is. This is one of Brian's gifts to the world. Enjoy this celebration of life. Open to it and receive the blessings if you can. Thanks to Brian, the Beach Boys and all involved in this work. Better late than never.

B0046HA260|5.0|I had purchased a pair of these shoes (different color) a few months ago and used them to run several races.  They worked out great.  After running a marathon, I put them in the wash machine to clean them a bit.  My son unloaded the wash machine and put everything in the dryer.  One of the shoes got caught by the heat vent and the bottom melted and the shoe curled up.  I was able to return them to some level of usability but I wasn't sure if they would be good enough for the half-marathon I had the next weekend.  On Thursday of that week I decided I couldn't risk running in the slightly damaged shoes and quickly order a new pair (I also didn't trust my backup pair of a different shoe for 13.1 miles).  Thanks to my Amazon Prime account, the shoes arrived the next day without any extra cost.  I wore the shoes around the house on Friday night, got up Saturday morning, ran my half-marathon and finished with my best time by 4 minutes and my feet had no blisters or pain at all.  Wonderful shoes and the Amazon Prime paid for itself.

B005KGPC4S|3.0|Sorry..  I can't see any shades of gray here.  Yes, the cult were bad guys.  Parks is great as an unhinged fundamentalist leading his flock of murderous homophobes.    What is most disturbing though is that in the movie the government feels that even after Waco that it is alright to kill every man woman and child to cover up a blunder, or worse, just because they feel like it.  There is nothing gray area about that.  I really hope that there are no ATF agents like those portrayed and I really hope that the patriot act is not being, or can't be used like it is in the movie.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I had been holding off watching Sherlock in an ever growing gueue of \\"things to watch.\\"  I knew of its writing pedigree in Steven Moffat who was responsible for some of the best Doctor Who episodes in the Russell Davies restart era and the current Doctor Who show runner.<br /><br />And yet I was still waiting... until today.<br /><br />Going in, I knew it would have a bit of the Doctor Who mad-supra-genius element outthinking the normals who fluster about as they run (literally in this episode) after him.  Maybe some clever turn of phrases and a \\"surprise\\" whodunit...  and done.  Maybe like House with a British accent.<br /><br />I have to admit I was floored by this episode.  They managed to cram a lot of Sherlock lore we expect and the mystery is decent.  But the insights into Holmes and his addictions as well as the mistakes he makes in his deductions were riveting as they spoke and drove him as a fuller character in a modern age.  Not just a cipher of a character to drive a mystery.<br /><br />And Watson was great.  As his character is a war-vet, his character is lost and finding himself and what the relationship with Sherlock is.  The actor playing him shows a deep inner strength growing as this episode continues.  I haven't seen the other two episodes but I hope Watson doesn't backslide...<br /><br />This was a delight for me and I can't recommend it enough!

0525423656|5.0|Cassia and Ky are living outside of Society, and both are forming plans on how to find one another.<br /><br />Cassia is in a working camp helping to keep up appearances for the Society by planting cotton, in the hopes that the mysterious `Enemy' will be swayed by prosperous plantations. Her official matching partner and best friend, Xander, has initiated their courtship once more in every hope that Cassia will join him in city central when her work detail is finished.<br />But it is while working the cotton fields that Cassia meets and forms an unlikely alliance with a fellow worker girl called Indie, who has just as many reasons as Cassia to make a mad dash and escape to the Outer Provinces.<br /><br />By stark contrast, Ky is interred at a camp where aberrations are terrorized and brutalized. Ky's days are spent hefting dead bodies into a supposedly poisoned lake. It is here that Ky meets and befriends a young aberration boy called Eli, who reminds Ky of Cassia's little brother. He also forms an escape-alliance with a natural-born-leader by the name of Vick, who has his own girl he's running back to.<br /><br />Cassia and Ky have been separated by Society . . . but they have no intention of going gentle into that good night. Cassia has found an unlikely match in Ky, and she will do anything it takes to get back to him. Even if it means risking life and limb in the dangerous Outer Provinces, where whispers of a rebellion are hard to ignore . . .<br /><br />`Crossed' is the second book in Ally Condie's YA dystopian `Matched' trilogy.<br /><br />This second novel is an Odyssey, of sorts. Since the explosive happenings of `Matched', Cassia has had her eyes opened to the short-comings of Society. She now sees the detriment in having only One Hundred Poems and One Hundred Paintings. She questions the life-limitation imposed at the age of 80. She has learnt to write when writing is forbidden, and she has fallen in love with an aberration boy who was not chosen for her. `Crossed' is a very different book from `Matched', purely because Cassia's narrative is suddenly self-aware and questioning. Her easy compliance and blinkered non-questioning of `Matched' is no more, and when `Crossed' begins Cassia is an entirely different person.<br /><br />We also get Ky's interiority in this novel, and his viewpoint is decidedly romantic. Ky is so focused on getting to Cassia, it's incredibly sweet to read his heartfelt yearning and just how deeply ingrained she has become on his heart.<br /><br />But `Crossed' is much more than a romance this time around . . . in this second novel, Condie is setting up a legend. As Ky and Cassia search for one another, they also hear whisperings of an uprising against their society. Other people like them want to change the way their world is run, and an unauthorized Tennyson poem is the language of rebellion;<br /><br />`Crossing the Bar'<br /><br />For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place<br />The flood may bear me far,<br />I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br />When I have crossed the bar.<br /><br />In this novel Condie's world-building expands beyond the regimented Society, to become something much, much more. Ky and Cassia travel across Grand Canyon planes and meet other outsiders like themselves - people who speak of a revered but undiscovered `Pilot' who will lead the rebellion and bring freedom from the society. With this whispered-legend, it feels like Condie is writing the history of an uprising, concentrating on the grass-roots of the fight's greatest leader - a veritable Che Guevara, Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela in the making. But the big question remains - who is Pilot?<br /><br />I loved `Crossed'. Condie had a big task to deliver something as impressively heartbreaking as `Matched' - and she has done it with absolute aplomb in this second novel. `Crossed' feels epic - as though readers are on the verge of a great discovery, being swept up in the hysteria of revolt and the promise of change. I can't wait for the third book in this impressive series.

B003L77GH4|3.0|Playback of DVD's was a little questionable.  They would start out playing then go blank.  My daughter had just watched all of season one (from Amazon) with no problem on her computer.  To defend the product, we did play them in DVD player and they worked.  Maybe it was just the computer, although the computer plays other DVD's just fine.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have always been interested in the earth and it's inhabitants so this series of videos was a perfect fit for me.  I have looked at them with my 7 and 9 year old grandchildren and they are enthralled by them.  We have only watched 2 so far but look forward to watching them all.  The videos are amazing and the quality is wonderful.  The series is packaged nicely (although I think a plastic case would be better for preservation).  The series is well worth the price and more!  They arrived very quickly and were well packaged.  Great purchase! Great product!
0425241505|5.0|First, let me say I loved this book!  It was a great read.  The writing was clear, the characters well written and funny.    I read a lot of paranormals and a lot of paranormal romances.  This book ranks right up there with all my favorites.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|Everything around the headset interferes, constant popping and crackling, no game sound half the time. Decent quality when it worked, but it hardly ever did. Don't waste your money.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|This movie is great. Fun for the whole family.  Is action packed and we don't get bored with this one. Recommend to go ahead and buy this one.
B005XI96E0|3.0|Oh he's trying.  The fa la la song compelled me to tolerate the Biebster.  I'm a 2 decade fan of Boyz II Men, been to their concerts, the whole deal.  Singing next to them, Biester shows he's got guts to put his voice out there to be compared (or ridiculed).  His voice is flat but in Fa la la, he's showing what practice can do and what he has the potential to sound like in another 5  - 10 years.  There were glimpse of a singing voice.  But man, Boyz II Men just made him look bad.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|I really wanted to like this recording.  I have been listening to it for three days in my car and I honestly can say that there is not one song that sticks with me.  Not one song that I even want to fast forward to...I find myself just wanting to fast forward through them all.
B003K025QO|5.0|Excelent package! The vinyl arrived sooner than i expected. Amazon is the best! Excelent site, easy to use and great products.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors started off strong, and this is by far one of their best albums, this is one of the greatest classical rock albums, Morrisions vocals are superb and unique, Manzarek's keyboard playing is legendary and doesn't get boring or simple, Kreiger was good at keeping up rhythm and creating complex jazz sounding guitar chords, and Desmore could keep a solid beat.   Break on Through 9/10- A fun, short song that makes good use of every instrument. The highlight of the song is Manzarek's organ soloing and despite being no bass, Ray also keeps a good riff with his piano bass. Morrison doesn't sing too much in this song but when he does, it starts to get a rock n roll feel to it. Of course this is also heavily influenced by 50s soul and latin jazz, as noted in the opening bass riff and drum beat.   Soul Kitchen 8.5/10- A very solid song that gets a little repetitive but is still pretty fun to listen to. This song is mainly about the vocals and Morrison does a great job with a little backup. The organ is highly repetitive but is a highly addictive riff and the guitar pretty much stays in the background. This is one of the songs you will remember the riff for once you finish the album.   The Crystal Ship 8/10- This is probably one of the slowest songs on the album and also one of the most poetic. This is basically Jim singing one of his poems to easy sounding music. Ray switches over to piano and plays some pretty ballady chords while Kreiger mainly plays a bass-like riff on the guitar. A really beautiful song, although it isn't the most interesting instrumentally, the vocals make up for it.   Twentieth Century Fox 7.5/10- Another short fun song. It plays out like any other classic rock song, with a pinch of blues influence. Morrison mainly stays in the background but works quite well for this song. This is actually a lot more guitar heavy than the past few songs and has a pretty cool solo in the middle, although nowhere near as awesome as Light my Fire's. Organ kind of sits back and mainly just blends in the back ground with sort of a blues sound to it, it actually begins to sound like House of the Rising Sun organ at a few points.   Alabama Song 8.5/10- Imagine a psychedelic drinking song, this is the perfect song for it. It just has bizarre sounding vocals and a up beat sort of rhythm. It is by far one of the most interesting of the album and is very keyboard heavy with some bizarre piano sounds behind the organ beat, which sort of goes along with the drums. Guitar goes along with the organ as well and mainly just keeps a beat for the vocals, which help make this song one awesome trip without any drugs needed.   Light My Fire 10/10- This is by far the best song on the album and probably the best song by the Doors period, it defined them as a band and has some of the greatest instrumentation of rock. The riff is legendary with organ leading into the chorus, Morrison singing is controversial yet so desirable Girl We Couldn't Get Much Higher, which leads to a long and amazing organ solo that you wish never ended, and when that ends, a guitar solo takes over for the next few minutes, which leads back the Morrison's chorus. This song just works perfectly for all the members of the band to shine and Desmore keeps the perfect beat.   Backdoor Man 7.5/10- I personally found this song the least interesting on the album, it is essentially the Doors meet Howlin' Wolf dirty style blues. This song is all about vocals and guitar, organ is very repetitive and in my opinion not to interesting, but the piano at least makes up for it when it occasionally comes in. The guitar has a mini solo in the middle that works pretty decently for the song, and this is pretty much Kreigers song to shine. Morrison does a decent job at playing the Back Door Man, but his voice wasn't the best for dirty blues, he was a much better rock singer.   I Looked At You 8.5/10- A pretty short fun song, that has a cool sounding bass/organ riff, and vocals work quite well. Its pretty interesting for all instruments and a little organ solo is thrown in, and one of my favorite of this album. Of course the false ending also builds up some good tension.   End of the Night 9/10- A very cool sounding song that enters into psychedelic territory that the Doors would further explore in their Strange Days album. This is all about vocals although the guitar also has a really cool sound to it. Morrison just sounds so emotional in this song and it sends chills down your spine if you are listening to this completely isolated in silence. The organ and keyboard actually aren't needed too much for this song, but do add a little psychedelic flavor.   Take it As it Comes 8.5- A pretty Spanish sounding song, its actually something I could see the animals or rolling stones singing. It has some pretty cool sounding vocals and the guitar of course just rocks. The organ of course adds the cherry on top, and even a little bit of soloing. The vocals are actually my favorite part of the song but the heavy keyboard bass riff comes close.   The End 8.5- I know this song deserves more credit, but its all about personal preference. The Doors enter into full psychedelic territory with this song and pretty much start off really soft while morrison calmly takes the mic and starts singing a poetic style ballad, while the guitar tries to emulate the playing style of a sitar and the organ just blends in the background with the drums. As the song gets near the end, the song gets even further into psychedelic territory and then explodes into ecstasy, and is actually a very suitable end to the song. If you are a lyrics person you will immediately fall in love with this song, the lyrics are highly interesting and bizarre, other than that its nice sounding but highly repetitive and pretty much the same thing for most of the 11 minutes.   So overall this is a must own album and I can't stress highly enough how this album defines the Doors as a talented band. Its not too heavy nor too soft and keyboard fans will instantly fall in love with Ray's advanced licks, plus classic songs like Light my Fire and Break on Through make this album essential for a Doors songs, none of the songs on this album are boring nor are there any bad songs on this album. Its a great introduction to start getting into the Doors.

B005WFUZTE|5.0|I thought Deths last cd Endgame was pretty good, but it did not blow me away....I got this CD without high expectations, but WOW, what a fantastic outing.  This is a new, instant favorite with me, reminiscent to Rust and Peace Sells....I can honestly say I enjoy just about every track on this CD.  If you are an old school Megadeth fan, I can pretty much guarantee that you will like this outing.  Dave and crew have never sounded better

B000N6TYLW|5.0|I received the 7th and final season.  I have some questions to the writers and producers. How could you get us hooked on this family, reel us in, keep us addicted for 7 long years and all of a sudden rip the town of Stars Hollow and all of its beloved characters from us.  At least give us a season 8 where Loreli and Luke actually gets married and decides on a house, let her get pregnant for him and have a child.  Let Miss Patty find her true love.  Where did Dean go, did his marriage to Christine ever get back on track?  What about Kurt and LuLu?  Is Taylor still running everyone crazy?  How did Rory do on the campaign? I think the writers, producers, network and whoever else should have been about to work it out for one more year, just for the sake of the fans.  But, for seven years you gave us a good ride.  I enjoyed from season one to season seven.  I have no complaints.  Thanks for the memories.  Anyone who has not purchased Gilmore girls, please purchase the entire series.  You will not be sorry.  It's a good investment for you and your daughters and your daughters daughters to come.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Received the Video on time & in good shape. Watched the Food, Inc. 3 times - wow, what an eye opener! It is changing the way our family eats and from where we will get our food - as much as possible - we will BUY FROM LOCAL FARMERS - FRESH - everything that we can - this is a MUST SEE by everyone!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I received the DVDs in record time.  They were in excellent condition.  The only thing I can say about Gilmore girls is the more Gilmore you get, the more Gilmore you want!  I laughed and cried with them.  Hats off to the writers, producers and characters.  Makes me want to visit Stars Hollow!
0618477942|5.0|As Art Spiegelman proved with Maus, father memoirs can take graphic narrative form.  Courageously original and lovingly honest, Fun Home is a coming of age story--a story of lesbian self-discovery--which also outs the father posthumously as a closeted gay man and a possible suicide.  In intertwining her father's story with her own, Bechdel is conscious of being as ruthless as her father was in \\"his monomaniacal restoration of our old house.\\"  She, too, is a Daedalus, who answers \\"not to the laws of society, but to those of [her] craft.\\"  Profoundly personal,  Fun Home is also mythic.  From the opening page onward, it is a rich affirmation of Stephen Daedalus's closing words in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man:  \\"Welcome, O life, I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead.\\"  This affirmation is triumphantly validated by \\"the tricky reverse narration\\" of Fun Home's final panels, in which Bechdel's artistically resurrected, epic father is there to catch and save her child self.
0345529057|3.0|Well, first of all, at the price the paperback box set is a bargain. nuff said. but.  this is an ok storyline..with some hints of the thread appearing in the first book.. but a box set of four books that have no conclusion seems inconguous and quite frankly at the pace of the second and third book, i could see another 5-8 books being required to get to a final climactic battle...   so, its ok for the price... particularly if you are a fantasy fan.. but if you are not a fantasy fan and you read the reviews and comparisons of the author to J.R. Tolkein then pass on this.. it is an over-hyped mediocre fantasy saga (of which there are hundreds).. this is no Lord of the Rings by far.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|This movie had a lot of potential. It was visually great, it had the creepy Silent Hill feel to it, the silent hill monsters were very realistic and held to the feel of the games, I loved that they used music we became familiar with through the game, and the casting was really well done. I liked the fact they chose Sean Bean to be Harry Mason (renamed Christopher De Salva). Sean Bean is a great actor and I thought he'd make the perfect Harry Mason.<br /><br />that's where the movie starts to fall apart. Now, I'm going to say this... this review is based on me being a fan of the games... those who never played the games, or who are horror movie enthusiasts may have a different experience with this movie as it has some positive qualities that may meet the expectations of horror movie fans.<br /><br />that being said... here's where the movie went wrong for me as a fan of the games.<br /><br />1. Harry Mason is the father of the Silent Hill franchise. he was the first playable character of the series. A widowed father raising his adopted daughter Cheryl on his own after the death of his wife, and he gets stuck in this freaky world after a car accident in which Cheryl disappears. He was completely cast aside for the movie. The movie focused on Rose De Salva, (Christopher's wife), a character who, if they are following the game, is suppose to be deceased. Why they needed to make that change was beyond me, especially when they had an amazing actor like Sean Bean to portray the role. While the actress portraying Rose was a good actress... it just didn't seem to work, at least not for me as a fan of the game who was looking forward to seeing Harry in action.<br /><br />2. Other drastic change in characters and plot. the storyline of silent hill is very solid. I always said, \\"Wow, this would make an awesome movie\\". so I don't know why they needed to do such a major re-write. Dahlia became two characters, Dahlia and Christabella. Alessa/Cheryl's story became different as well. in the game Cheryl (Renamed Sharon in the movie) was created from part of Alessa's soul as she fought to release herself from a cult ritual. in the movie Alessa was bullied for being a child born to an unwed mother, and she was raped by a janitor at school. Her mother (Christabella) allowed a cult to perform a ritual to restore her innocence after the rape, only they were really going to kill her. in this process she was burned alive, and survived, In her pain she created a dark version of herself, and a version of herself (Sharon/Cheryl) that was what was left of her goodness and innocence. I'm not a fan of changing the storyline to the rape of a child, nor was I happy with the gratuitous nudity that added nothing to the movie at all. the storyline of the first game was solid enough without all these changes. Also, in the game when Alessa is near her end, she creates a child who is believed to be her reincarnation, who Harry escapes with and raises. She becomes Heather, the main character of Silent Hill 3. This does not happen in the movie. Will be interesting to see how they explain the \\"heather\\" character in the upcoming sequel with the way this movie ended.<br /><br />3. the metal pipe is a big part of almost every silent hill game. its usually the first weapon you find, and is a strong weapon until you find something better, and is usually used again when you run out of bullets to the guns you find. You could hear game fans in the audience say \\"here we go finally\\" when Rose found a metal pipe... only she didn't use it as weapon.<br /><br />4. The biggest mistake was trying to cram too much into one movie. they used monsters from Silent Hill 1. They used monsters (like Pyramid head) from Silent Hill 2, they created monsters (like the Janitor) who hadn't appeared in any Silent hill game to that point, then they created a cast of townspeople. the focus was more on the townspeople than the monsters, so as visually awesome as the monsters looked, they were more ofbonuses in the movie rather than playing any pivotal role as they do in the games. Had they focused on less monsters, and created less cast of characters, they could have had the monsters do more than look cool, and they could have saved some that weren't shown for a movie sequel.<br /><br />5. the end of the movie... well no one is quite sure what it represents. Since the reincarnation thing didn't take place as it did in the game, and the way the movie ended, it left things up in the air... were they still trapped in SH because of Alessa since it seemed they were in the same house with Chris (Harry) at the same time, but weren't... it's going to be hard to explain the upcoming sequel how Sharon (Cheryl) becomes Heather considering they're supposedly still trapped in the Silent Hill world.<br /><br />long story short (too late) this movie would have been a good stand alone movie. if they didn't try to loosely base it on the 1st video game and just made it a stand alone Silent Hill movie, unrelated to any specific game other than the fact it takes place in the silent hill world... it may have worked... It could still work for horror movie fans who are not fans of the video games or have never played the games. It is a watchable movie if you can separate the game from the movie. I found it more enjoyable when I considered it a stand alone story and not based off the first game.<br /><br />For fans of the video games, this may be one to rent before you decide if you want to buy. In the end... it wasn't a bad movie... The movie is well acted, visually appealing, and has a lot of good plot that will interest non-game fans. it was just a bit of a disappointment to gamers who were hoping for a more 'true' representation of the game. For me, the Silent Hill game had a much stronger story than this movie did. They should have stuck a little more closely to the original plot.bonuses in the movie rather than playing any pivotal role as they do in the games.

B005PKOOT8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Spanish music, specifically David Bisbal. I needed a change though, so looking around I found this album and it is absolutely wonderful. Pablo Alboran's songwriting is perfection, and his musicianship truly shines through. Beautiful, beautiful album. I've listened to it countless times.
031603438X|5.0|After reading \\"Life\\" I was exhausted. I could only imagine how tired Keith was while writing this great book;being this guy seems grindingly laborious. He lets us see, warts and all, his life unfold as a young man finding his place in the world. What impressed me the most about Keith Richards, was the savage work ethic he possessed. There is no way a person can play a guitar like this guy, without commiting to an inordinate amount of work. To me Richards is simply a working stiff, who happens to love what he does to make his dollar. I got the sense that this whole persona he has the burden to carry, is secondary to who he truly is.    In \\"Life\\" we see Richards the son, friend, husband,and parent. We see a guy who has had a good run with his career. We see a leader, who will throw down, and have the courage of his convictions. We see a guy who knows full well that he is a flawed creature like us all. Moreover, we see a guy who has enjoyed the ride, and simply tilts his hat at the persona that has evolved with him. I got a sense that Keith Richards doesn't take himself seriously;however, he takes his job very seriously-remember the \\"savage work ethic?\\" Once I got through all of the sex, drugs and war stories, blah, blah, blah,et al. the book got really interesting.    An image I kept seeing, was Richards and Jagger bashing out melodies and lyrics;doing the work as it were. I found nothing glamorous about being in this band of talented players. I saw this as a very hard job, which was done to the best of the band's collective abilities. Being Keith Richards is dangerous work and not for the feint of heart.     There are some great photos in \\"Life.\\" One picture in particular really spoke to me. There's a shot of Keith sitting in his library(he has an expansive literary knowledge base),and he looks like a happy guy. He has a guitar, a pack of smokes, a drink and his stacks of books. Amid this sanctuary swirls musical and literary energy, in other words life itself, and Keith has dared to live it. If I ever had the chance to ask this hotshot Rock icon something, I'd ask him if I could look through his book shelves and see what he reads. Here would lie more insight into this man's extrordinary life, a life which dares us to live ours.
142311339X|4.0|When this book came out, I was just finishing up the last Olympian.  I was hungry for more Percy.  I read the book within a day and two weeks.  No Percy.  Yeah, sure, his name was said a few times but I missed the hero that I knew throughout the Percy Jackson series.  I had to wait a whole year for the next one.  I book was amazing though.  I only gave a 4 star because Percy wasn't in it.  I'd hate to rate any book by Rick that.  Other than that, It was awesome!  Some times I over-read at night and my dad would have to come into my room and tell me to put the book down and sleep.  (Of course, that didn't stop me)
B00003CX5A|4.0|The video worked well, no skipping or problems.  It was at times gruesome as the headless horseman was riding about the countryside chopping off heads.  Bought this movie to see how Johnny Depp did in this.  The acting was good and it would be a great movie to show at a Halloween gathering; very spooky yet not overwhelming.
0786838655|5.0|I was in the forth grade when I noticed some of my friends reading it.  So I gave it a try.  This was my favorite book I've ever read.  After this first one, I started reading all the novels in the series.  Rick got me so into Greek Mythology that day on.  Because of him, I now have a list of about 215 Greek goddesses I know and so many gods.  Because of him,I drive my sisters crazy with what I know about it.  I wouldn't know much about greek myths if it hadn't been for Rick.    Anyway, the book is creative and interesting.  I talked about it so much at home, my dad started to listen to it being played on a CD in his car.  My dad loves the series too.  This is a novel I will never ever forget.  Rick changed my life and gave me more interests in one series.  I thank him for opening a new world for me and all his readers.
B000I9S5VY|5.0|I love this movie sooooo much not just because of Johnny Depp (yumm *_*  but because of the essence and energy of the movie. It's really \\"hep\\" :)there are a couple of deleted scenes in this version that I wish they would have kept in the movie, and some annoying bleeps where the F bombs should be but its still a great movie nontheless.
034552554X|5.0|I felt Vanessa Diffenbaugh's experience as a foster mother really came through in her writing. If you have any experience with the foster system, I think this book will touch you deeply.  I worked for a pediatrician who saw a lot of foster kids and during that time I felt the same emotions I felt while reading this book...at times sad, but at the same time, so hopeful. I have also gained a new appreciation for flowers and their meanings and found myself chuckling at the meaning of some of my and my friends' wedding flowers. Even though Victoria made many poor decisions throughout the book, I found myself still rooting for her until the end.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|We rented this for the kids to watch the day before Halloween.  Besides being a great movie and a lot of fun for the family, the quality of the video was fantastic.  This was our first Amazon rental, which we watched with our Roku device.  I couldn't have been happier with the picture quality and will not hesitate to rent from Amazon again.  And yes, that pumpkin song is still stuck in my head.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I had never seen the series and wanted to buy the first season to check it out and everywhere i went they were charging at least $40 and up for it on DVD. I paid less than half that for the whole season on Amazon - a used set but it works perfectly and i'm on to the second season already! Very nice!!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Oh my God.... I have literally never heard a worst album than this. WTF were Metallica and Lou Reed thinking? Avoid at all costs! The ONLY way this album is worth anything is if you wanna annoy your coworkers and you yourself are deaf. This garbage is ridiculous.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|I consider myself a long time Wilco fan and consider them my favorite band of all time. In most cases, Jeff Tweedy can do no wrong, and most of the time, he does everything just right. I admit, I tend to fall in with the crowd who consider Being There, Summerteeth, and YHF to be Wilco's most interesting, enjoyable, and strongest albums to date. I have watched \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" at least 5 times (you can get on Netflix streaming), and while I do think Jay Bennett comes across as a pseudointellectual who over analyzes even the simplest tasks, it is hard to argue that the guy wasn't talented. JB brought something really special to the early Wilco recordings, and I agree wholeheartedly with those who say that since his depature, and sadly his death, Wilco is a very different band, for better or for worse. With that said, I do not think is is appropriate to compare \\"The Whole Love\\" to the albums that Wilco recorded before 1999. I cannot even really compare it to A Ghost is Born, which I like fine, but I am not crazy about it. I have several friends who think that after the \\"brilliance\\" displayed on A Ghost is Born, Sky Blue Sky was a huge disappointment. I actually like SBS more than A Ghost is Born. Sure, Tweedy mellowed, sold some of the songs to Volkswagon, seems to address his wife and kids throughout the album, but I also think he says some very beautiful things about the role of the artist as an individual, the role of artist as a creator, and the role of artist as a family man, and the delicate way in which to fuse the three together. The instruments on SBS carry the lyrics along nicely and the album is mixed very well. I was actually more disappointed in Wilco The Album. It has some catchy tunes, but overall I think it is probably their most boring album to date. So when The Whole Love was released, I knew I would buy it, but I was kind of preparing myself not to enjoy it. I will admit that initially I didn't, but then after I heard Standing O, I mean after I really listened to that song, and I couldn't get out of my head.  It is such a good rockin' tune that reminds me of some of Wilco's early great rockers like Outtasite Outtamind or Forget the Flowers. After loving that song so much I have found other new favorites on the album and I agree that song for song, The Whole Love is Wilco at their finest. I agree with the reviewers who have commented about certain songs sounding like John Lennon or the Beatles. I think the title song, for instance, could've been written by John and Paul. But make no mistake, it is Wilco, all Wilco, and there is no other band like them.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|Thank you Justin for this beautiful Christmas CD! It truly shows the spirit of the holiday season! All of the songs are beautifully sung! His generosity and thoughtfullness comes through in each song. Whether you're 1 or 100 you will love this album! I so love the traditional songs with the Justin touch! You will absolutely love the new original songs too! Some are tender that showcase Justin's vocal range. Then there are fun upbeat songs that showcase Justin's playfulness! This is my new favorite Christmas CD! Thank you as well to all the Artists who appear on this wonderful album like Mariah, Usher, Boys II Men, Perry... It is an enjoyable labor of Love! This new album will surely be a Holiday classic for years to come!

B002I0J5FG|2.0|I was expecting HD quality meant that they would reskin all the landscapes. Really, this game is about being emmersed in an environment. On the PS3 this thing looked like the old one but worse because the HD quality brings out all of the weaknesses in the old textures. Retread only, if you don't have it on PS2 then OK.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|This is the only new Christmas LP I've been looking forward to this season. It does not disappoint. Zooey has such a lovely voice, it seems perfect for 'quiet' Xmas songs. The only out of place songs are the uptempo ones, like \\"Little Saint Nick\\". I hope it does very well in sales.

0823003035|5.0|I have found this book to be extremely helpful as I try to improve at figure drawing. It gives detailed instructions and good photos of the step by step process. It is a very time consuming process, but one that brings in very good results. I find his quick sketches (ones done in 20 minutes or less) to be even more beautiful than the highly polished, finished pieces that take 30 hours or more to do. Highly recommend!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this on a whim along with my i5 2500k and was not disappointed.   O/C'ed @ 4.3GHZ (variable vcore) it keeps my CPU at 20-25*C and 35-40*C during full load.   Fan features a great design, runs silent, and retails for $17 alone.   PWM, (nearly) universal mounting, and extra clips so that you can add an extra fan if you feel necessary... all for under $30.   The only thing I was expecting was a solid copper base like my old HSF but considering the performance... it probably isn't necessary. ALso the box includes a small tube of thermal paste so no need to buy your own separately (like I did!).
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This is a fun, total escape and enjoyable movie! It is beautiful to look at and the performances are witty and lighthearted. If you are looking for a fun adventure and escape from your everyday world, this is just the right film. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the hero of the film, all muscles and wry smile. Sit back and enjoy a wild adventure into another world.
0545091020|4.0|I bought this Audio book for my boyfriend. I was telling him about the book on a hike...after reading it my self you picture everything as you are in the hunger games. (lame but true. LOL) He seemed interested and has a long commute each day--i read that Audio books are great for the commuters. Its great how the chapters are set up on the CDs, I believe there are 9 disks with this...and its a great price compared to anywhere else! Only thing that I had trouble with, the woman whom they picked to read it. After listening each day he'd laugh at the way she says \\"Peeta\\". Very mono tone and bland. So if you have trouble with that, I'd try to find a clip to listen to before purchasing. But other than that, the story comes out more than her voice.

I couldn't wait for his first album, however I had trouble identifying with some of the selections, being much older than Scotty himself.  However, for a teen, it's likely to be the perfect choice. This album is all about high school and young love.

B000VK99Z6|5.0|I first saw this in the theatre with my wife, expecting a sort of British Naked Gun/Police Squad-type spoof (according to how the TV commercials portrayed it) and was very pleasantly surprised.  Hot Fuzz quickly became, and remains, my all-time favorite movie ever, an amazingly seamless, energetic, hilarious, flat-out wonderful blend of action, murder mystery, horror, slapstick, satire, jokes, and unforgettable characters.<br /><br />It starts with a promising and genuinely funny premise (Overachieving big-city cop gets reassigned to sleepy country town because he's making the big city officers look bad!) and gets surprisingly complicated but never chaotic.  If anything, it gets better and better, with a rushing, but always witty quick-cut pizzazz that reminds me of everyone from Russ Meyer to Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />It turns out the stars and director, unknown to me at the time, cut their teeth many years prior on a BBC TV sitcom called Spaced, a sort of grungier, more eccentric version of the American sitcom Friends, notable for its many quick-cut, lunatic fantasy sequences (a quirk subsequently adopted by How I Met Your Mother...although probably not all that original to anyone who remembers the Monkees!)<br /><br />Back to Hot Fuzz (and about time).  As is typical of Great Movies, Hot Fuzz has all the right ingredients: a tight, witty script by star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright; an abundance of such top-flight British character actors as Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, an amusingly slimy turn by former James Bond Timothy Dalton, and memorable cameos from Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, and Bill Bailey.  Pegg and his co-star Nick Frost resemble a more modern and definitely more believable Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, and the movie is much propelled by their natural charm and chemistry.<br /><br />On the commentary track Pegg and Wright agree that with DVDs filmmakers feel obliged to add as much detail as possible to warrant repeat viewings and indeed Hot Fuzz has so much going on you'll want to watch it again and again, and, I predict that, like me, you'll always be glad you did.<br /><br />Of course a lot of people may remember Pegg & Frost & Co. from their classic zombie spoof Shaun of the Dead but in my humble opinion Hot Fuzz is a superior, more original piece of work, full of great comic timing and witty, endlessly-quotable lines and gags, and, as I intimated before, a genuinely funny story. Add a great soundtrack and startling plot twists all the way through, and this most modern and boisterous of action/buddy movie/comedy/murder mysteries adds up to that most old-fashioned but welcome of things: a truly GREAT movie night!to watch it again and again, and, I predict that, like me, you'll always be glad you did.

B004EPYZQM|4.0|Michael Bay could learn a few tricks from Justin Lin who directs his 3rd franchise hit.  Lin brings back Vin Diesel as Dom who is clearly in charge of the operation once set free from a prison transport bus in the dynamite opening sequence.  Most of the usual crew is back including Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster.  They and a few others end up in Rio.  Once there, needing money, they hook up with a local crime mob to heist a few high end cars.  This sets up another remarkable stunt sequence that is as exciting as those usually reserved for James Bond movies.  Before I get too gushy about the movie, let's get one thing clear.  It is implausible, improbable, and perhaps even impossible.  The acting isn't all that great, the plot is stupid and the science behind some of the stunt work ain't there.  Yet, after being drawn in during the first 20 minutes, you're hooked. You will also see some of the best stunt driving ever.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Park your brain and settle in for the ride.  This is the best of the \\"Furious\\" films...by a long shot.
B004EPZ00W|5.0|Moneyball is a special kind of movie, because it sheds light on how unbalanced Major League clubs were following the advent of free agency, and players going to the teams with the highest bidding. Billy Beane (played  brilliantly by Brad Pitt) is a loyal person who tries in vain to find a way to win with a small payroll. With his 2001 team dismantling before his very eyes, he meets Peter Brand, who he quickly recruits for the A's front office (assistant general manager). Beane becomes a believer in Brand's perception of talent, and tries to sell it to skeptical front office personnel. In the middle of it all is a disagreeable Art Howe, who doesn't want much to do with the radical changes and certain on-field moves; this causes friction between he and Beane, and the stage is set for a disasterous season........or is it? What I liked the most about this movie was the fact that it had just the right amount of humor in it, and gives a feel for what it's like to be a general manager in MLB. Pitt plays  the busy businessman, and makes frequent trips to the clubhouse to try to inspire his players. The most touching part of the movie is when he turns down $12,500,000 to run the Boston Red Sox. Beane's heart lies with the Athletics, and as impressive and appealing as the Red Sox were, he stays in Oakland, because it's unfinished business. Watching this movie made me realize that there's still some loyalty left in the old game.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|For me there was too much of the Romance Novels: Should She, Shouldn't She, Is He, Isn't He. There was also too much reliance on the heroines mysteriously accurate visions of future events: this makes the common attitude of her fellow townspeople, that she is something of a nut case, the only reasonable explanation for them and for us to arrive at. The mystery itself is out of Mary Roberts Reinhardt, Carolyn Wells, and many other writers of what were, then, categorized as \\"Lady in Distress\\" . Nevertheless, the author, is sufficiently skilled to make it all palatable, creating a mostly entertaining diversion. Since  this is to be a series, one can anticipate improvement as the author makes her decisions about just how  deviant she wants her character to be. This one should please many readers of the Romantic Mystery.
0307463745|3.0|Rework is a quick read : There is a lot of white spaces & illustrations and the fonts are big.  I appreciated the content of the book but you have to take it with a grain of salt : there is no \\"success recipe\\". Less is not always enough to succeed.   If you are able to go beyond the preacher tone in which the book is written, it's a fun read. There is even some good and insightful advices in it.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My 2 year old son has loved this book since he got it over a year ago so we were really excited to get him the movie version. It is a little more scary than the book only because the animation and music highlights some of the characteristics of the Gruffalo but my son didn't seem to get freaked out; he asked to watch it again as soon as the credits started to roll. It is extremely well done and the animation is very beautiful. I highly recommend this movie for kids already familiar with or new to the Gruffalo tale.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love comics. Always have, always will. I doubt that anyone could beat me in Batman trivia. Or Green Lantern. Or Swamp Thing. Anything Darkhawk.... Okay, so DH is Marvel. Anyway. What I have always loved in comics is man's ability to overcome enormous tribulations without relying on so called 'super powers'. Knowing this, you can imagine how bad I wanted to see Captain America. Despite the fact that I am a DC fanboy.<br /><br />Marvel's latest addition to what will be the Avenger's film is a knock out of the park. The sense of the Cap before the super-soldier program is amazing. There's this 80-pound version of Chris Evans and he's the best. Loyal and morally strong, with a love of the American ideals. The transformation into a super soldier is amazing; he is shown 'over-using' his new body and all but trips himself up because he actually realize he's running faster on foot than the cars drive around him. His innocent patriotism becomes an unstoppable force, and it makes you believe that one man can indeed make a difference.<br /><br />I have to give a nod to Alan Silvestri's score for the film. It strikes a strong central theme that fits the balance between patriotism and honest strength and it sounds authentic to the mid-40's. Well done, good sir.<br /><br />Cinematography is marvelous. Together with the stages and authentic vehicles and storefronts, we actually feel that we've been engaged with WWII hanging over our heads.<br /><br />The BD is just as awe-inspiring. We have the Holy Grail of sound - a 7.1 Sound track; it's only the 2nd I've ever seen. We get several featurettes, all showing various technical tid-bits and it is not the same point-counting drivel some folk have thrown together on DVD or BD. They manage to provide the tech talk with their own appreciation of the source material. There's a short film featuring Agent Coulson which demands automatic laughter at the most unsuspected details. Worth the $25 of the Blu-Ray 2-disc. It's gonna be a classic, mark my words.<br /><br />I'm watching the film now with the commentary. Already it seems less 'stuffy' than most; a mixture of technical talk with fond memories.  >>>EDIT: the commentary is actually pretty fun stuff, pointing out Easter eggs and hinting towards things to come. Alas, they provided no commentary on the post-credits scene. Not that they needed to; it pretty much speaks for itself.>>><br /><br />But the best part is, we have seen some bit of what Marvel has in store for us. The Avenger's film is going to break a few benchmarks in modern film making. DC may have the Animated features each a tight and solid entry for the DCU, but beyond the Batman franchise, and possibly Green Lantern, DC just doesn't match the steam behind Marvel's power. I'm still holding out for a Flash feature film.<br /><br />I'll probably catch some flames from this review. But I have to be honest and objectionable. Marvel is reminding me of a time in my youth when I didn't know DC Comics existed. And the Avengers were one of my favourite titles way back then. I'm glad to see anything positive come from anything comic-book related. Makes the years of living as a geek somewhat tolerable. Almost.mark my words.<br /><br />I'm watching the film now with the commentary.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|Like everyone else I'm beside myself with this collection (even though I'd heard most of the tracks before). I/we have been waiting for this for an eternity! It's about time! When I found out earlier this year that the original 'Smile' would be released (then pushed back until today), I was counting the days. I had today off and at 10:00 sharp entered the local CD store and walked out with the 2-CD Set five minutes later. I drove for the next two hours while I listened to every note on my car stereo. Then listened again. There were more snippets than I knew existed. I mean, didn't Brian say years ago that he got rid of a lot of the tracks because it was too painful to keep them? I'm glad that was a falsity. Anyway, I loved it infinitely more than the 2004 version, mainly due to the 1966 Beach Boy voices! Listening to the Smile background vocal track and hearing Brian's clear high angelic voice withers the 2004 vocal versions. No offense to Darian, Scott and the boys, who shine on that album. My only qualms with the Smile Sessions (and they really don't matter for my overall enjoyment); are: 1. Most of the tracks are in mono; and 2. My favorite 30 seconds of the album needed to be recorded louder per volume and in my opinion carry on a little longer: The 'Whispering Winds' section of the latter part of 'Holidays'. Other than those trivialities on my part, the album is a classic! Thanks Beach Boys and Capitol! Finally!

B0041KKYEM|4.0|With a story based on Russian folk tales, Pyotr Tchaikovsky composed SWAN LAKE about 1875.  Although it was not well received on its debut, over time the ballet has become a world-wide favorite, and it is particularly noted for the fact that the prima ballerina must play both the virginal White Swan \\"Odette\\" and her alter ego, the wanton and evil Black Swan \\"Odile.\\"  Directed by Darren Aronofsky and with story and script fashioned by writers Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin, BLACK SWAN pivots on this schism--and owes a significant debt to three other notable films: PERSONA, in which two women have a relationship that confuses their personalities; THE RED SHOES, in which a ballerina becomes excessively involved in her role; and REPULSION, in which a sexually disturbed young woman collapses into insanity.  The film also owes a debt to such films as MULHOLLAND DR in the sense that it is difficult to know what is really happening to the ballerina and what is only occurring in her own mind.<br /><br />In a general sense, the story concerns ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), who has spent her career in the corps de ballet and whose great ambition as a dancer is to be absolutely perfect--an ambition that has rendered her flawless in precision but a shade lacking in passion.  When the company's leading ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) is essentially dismissed due to increasing age and an unstable temperment, Nina is announced as the star of a new production of SWAN LAKE.  Her confidence, however, is undermined by competing ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis), her suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey), and her choreographer (Vincent Cassel.) Under the pressure, and repeatedly told that she lacks the passion for the Black Swan, Nina begins to descend into a series of delusions that may be stress, personal fantasy, or flat out schizophrenia.  All of the moments are presented with remarkable power, and they lead to an uncertain but powerful conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is memorable throughout, and Natalie Portman justly walked away with an Oscar for her performance.  At the same time, the film is not without flaws.  The first half of the film feels somewhat slow and overall the movie is icy cold.  Since every one of them deeply competitive and resorts to manipulation in an effort to dominate others, none of the characters are likeable or sympathetic, and the progression of the film seemed a bit spotty to me, skipping from one point to another without always connecting the dots.  Even so, it is a truly intriguing film, wildly Freudian, intensely paranoid, and unusual in every way.

0307352145|5.0|A few years ago, I read and reviewed [[ASIN:1569245134 Party of One: The Loners' Manifesto]], a magnificent book that made the defiant case that introversion was not a condition to be \\"cured,\\" a shell that one needs to \\"come out of,\\" or a warning sign of a budding mass murderer, but rather a not-at-all-uncommon manifestation of personality that should be respected, honored, and understood ... most of all by those of us who are introverts ourselves. Based on the reactions I got to my review -- which I can only assume were but a fraction of the reactions author Anneli Rufus must have received -- it was an argument that really needed to be heard.<br /><br />I think the people who welcomed \\"Party of One\\" will be just as overjoyed by \\"Quiet.\\" Although focused less on the ways society libels and defames introverts, \\"Quiet\\" author Susan Cain makes an equally strong argument for the virtues and strengths of introversion, basing much of her case on the neuroscience that shapes so much of who we are and how we behave. If, as Rufus argues, introverts are as well-adjusted as extroverts, just not adjusted \\"to the same frequency,\\" Cain goes into much greater depth on exactly what frequency it is we are adjusted to and, to stretch the metaphor, what signals our introverted minds and personalities are receiving as a result.<br /><br />It's a fascinating and profoundly encouraging and empowering message, and also more than a little unexpected. For instance, Cain demonstrates that creativity is often better achieved by acting solo than through group brainstorming sessions, that modern \\"open office\\" design hinders instead of promotes productivity, that it's okay to fake extroversion sometimes, but also okay to go out of your way to avoid contact with others when you need a break, and much more. Along the way, we're introduced to a number of interesting case studies, including Greg and Emily, whose marriage is feeling the strain of an ongoing argument about dinner parties; Mike, an introverted Chinese-American student trying to adjust to a higher-education system in which grades depend heavily on class participation; a little girl named Isabel whose mother, blessedly, learns how to support and encourage an introverted child; and Ethan, an older boy whose parents, infuriatingly to me, do not.<br /><br />This fascinating, well-researched, and well-written book covers a great deal more ground too. I hope it's widely read and discussed, not only by introverts, but also by those who know, work with, and/or love an introvert ... which covers pretty much everybody. If, as Cain quotes Gandhi, \\"In a gentle way, you can shake the world,\\" this book ought to give it a good shove.rican student trying to adjust to a higher-education system in which grades depend heavily on class participation; a little girl named Isabel whose mother, blessedly, learns how to support and encourage an introverted child; and Ethan, an older boy whose parents, infuriatingly to me, do not.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|I've loved John Williams' music since I was exposed to it in band in high school in the late 1980s, and more so when his music was used for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics (and is still used by NBC when they broadcast the olympics). Then I got an even better exposure to his music at an orchestra concert a few years ago where the theme of the night was his music, most of which I didn't know he had composed, way back from the 1940s-1970s. I've had my CD set for a few years; love it.  He will be sadly missed as he is getting older; I dread the day of his future passing, hopefully many years from now.
030788743X|5.0|READY PLAYER ONE is a love novel to the 1980s set in the year 2044. The world is on the brink of collapse. Starvation, unemployment, and poverty are everywhere. People have flocked to the cities in search of work and food, but most to no avail. To the masses, the only good thing about the world is the OASIS, a massive unlimited online virtual role-playing world. You can be anything in the OASIS: you can actual act out and \\"live\\" those role playing D&D games, you can be Indiana Jones and \\"live\\" through his adventures yourself, you can \\"live\\" those cheesy choose-your-own adventure books you read as a kid, you can study magic at Hogwarts, etc., etc., etc. You can do all the things you do in the real world, too. For instance, more kids attend school in the OASIS than they do in real school buildings. You can buy things in the OASIS and in the trouble times of 2044, OASIS money is worth more than the real thing. Yet, despite this, the OASIS is still just a massive online virtual game; it isn't real.<br /><br />THE OASIS was created by a somewhat reclusive geek named James Halliday. Halliday was obsessed with the 1980s and in the parts of the OASIS he created, it shows. Halliday became the world's wealthiest person and before he died he created a challenge. He had no family and had abandoned his only friends years before. So, he created a puzzle. The first person who could solve the puzzles, beat the challenges, and finds the keys would win the ultimate prize: a hidden egg that would give the winner possession of all Halliday's possessions both in the real world and the OASIS. Wade Watts is a high school senior who has been searching diligently for Halliday's egg since the man died. He's an orphan who lives with his aunt and cousins in a trailer in some \\"stacks\\" (trailer homes built on top of each other kind of like a skyscraper). Wade's online name is Parzival and he ends up being the first person to solve the first part of Halliday's challenge. That begins a chain reaction of events that turns Wade not only into a wealthy individual but also one of the most hunted men in the world. Not everyone is hunting for the egg in an ethical way and they will stop at nothing to get the prize.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into READY PLAYER ONE because there are so many things that have to be explained at the beginning. However, once a reader becomes familiar with the concept of the OASIS and understands it's rules and how a person in the real world can interact with and in the OASIS, the book becomes much easier to follow. The story is essentially a sci-fi/fantasy quest told in the form of a memoir. The concept of a world such as the OASIS isn't anything new, but the way Cline integrates that concept into a fairly traditional sci-fi/fantasy story is. Not only that, but the book is chock full of 1980s references: tv shows, books, movies, video games, songs, quotes, and famous people from that decade are thoroughly referenced throughout. There were parts of the book that I found nostalgic, but I was also introduced to some music and movies that I had never heard of before. You don't have to have an appreciation of the 1980s to enjoy the novel, but all the 1980s references do provide the book with a solid foundation and will add to your enjoyment if you have an appreciation of the decade.<br /><br />The book is a great read in and of itself, but it holds a particular appeal to geeks and nerds and those who grew up or have an appreciation of the 1980s.nts that turns Wade not only into a wealthy individual but also one of the most hunted men in the world.

B002ZG98G4|3.0|I guess the problem with this romcom is the usual premise that we've seen a million times.  I would also argue that the most fun would have been better byplay between Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford.  Keaton really tries, but Ford's boorish news \\"legend\\" is too one dimensional, not to mention unlikeable.  Becky (Rachel McAdams, good) is a hyperactive morning show producer that occasionally borders on annoying and her new crush, Patrick Wilson, is just female eye candy playing the role usually reserved for women.  The movie isn't a total loss however.  Jeff Goldblum is underused but effective as the programming director.  I really like this guy.  His humor is infectious.  He should be used in more films.  There is a sequence when Becky changes the direction of the show, putting the shows \\"personalities\\" in more reality based stories.  It's a hoot.  For that reason alone, the film's worth a look.
1416511946|5.0|I have heard about this book over the years but never really was interested in reading it. Honestly thought it would be like reading the rambling of the drugged out rock star. Funny thing is I read the book because of seeing him on LA Ink and realizing what a nice guy he really is. I then wandered what the heck this book was all about and was really shocked to find that this was really a good book. Even though he was so strung out most of the time he still had the peace of mind to put it all on paper. I am not sure if he changed any of the diary from the original so we could understand the drugged out rambling but either way this was a great book.<br />More power the the man to put his personal life and writings out there for the whole world the read. This just shows that he was willing to do this to help others and let the rest of us understand some of the craziness named Nikki Sixx
B003UM8T3U|3.0|While I recognize this classic film was to have established a \\"new wave\\" of filmmaking, I had never seen it.  Keeping to their tradition, the Criterion folks do a fine job transferring the black and white film to disc although the 4:3 aspect ratio is a bit unsettling at first.  Also, the film is in mono, aided by Dolby Digital.  I can see how the film is loved by most film connoisseurs but I'm not overly impressed.  First of all Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel seems over his head.  I remember when I was 17 or thereabouts, I tried one of those French cigarettes (Gauloises).  It made Camels seem like candy.  It reminded me of Michel chain smoking what appeared to be a homemade doobie throughout the movie.  I digress.  I didn't like him or Belmondo.  On the other hand I loved Jean Seberg as Patricia, an American student and wannabe journalist.  She falls for Michel in spite of his obvious criminal activities.  She must wrestle with the idea of staying with him or pursuing her career.  For me, the film feels very dated but I can appreciate the stylistic changes Jean-Luc Godard put in motion.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|We just tried Amazon's service for the first time. The ease of acquiring the movies and the multiple viewing and upload options are incredible! The easiness and INSTANT gratification of this won me over in a heartbeat. I hope this service continues to be available. We haven't tried watching on our big screen yet or uploading to my iPhone, but I'm sure the experience will be just as easy and quick as the first.  THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!  P.S. Please offer the NON \\"family-friendly\\" selections from popping up when we first open the application so that our little ones' eyes don't see the scary or inappropriate jacket covers. Thanks again.
0425241505|4.0|This book was really good, but I had a few problems with it. I am not a fan of insta-love between hero and heroine and especially not when they fight over stupid things because they love each other or are confused. That part was frustrating. I wanted to smack both of them for a majority of the book. I wanted Pia to get pregnant (for whatever reason, I kind of called this) but I was not happy with the way it was handled. The hero and heroine had to fight yet again and she couldn't just explain anything. I know a lot of the problems are supposed to stem from Pia being closed off, but I don't think that was communicated very well.<br /><br />SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILER<br /><br />I really loved the cast of characters, besides the fighting. I loved the supporting characters, they really helped the last half of the story. I liked that Pia was a unicorn because I think that it fit her personality well. I liked the way that you could see growth with Dragos' character. I am interested to see where the series goes next, because this book almost read as a stand alone.<br /><br />END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER<br /><br />I also loved the different view on Wyrs and magic. It read like a high fantasy in an urban setting which was one of my favorite parts :)
0894803123|3.0|Good book, lots of recipes.  All of the recipes in this book use a sweet cream base. There are 3 recipes for the base and two of them use raw eggs and the third is only recommended (by the aurthors) if you can't make one of the other two.    So, if you have young children or have a compormised immune system, you may want to try another book that uses recipes with cooked eggs. The Perfect Scoop has some really nice recipes and they cook their eggs.
0142419400|5.0|I have to admit that this was one of my favorite books from this year!  The characters were wonderful. A lot of times in young adult books, authors make teenagers in love out to be this ridiculous \\"thing.\\" It is almost as if they mock it, because teenagers could never understand what love is.. you know. But, I am very happy to say that Stephanie Perkins does not come anywhere near this. The characters felt like real people and were fully developed. They also had relationships that were real and made you interested.  I found that plot to be girl falls in love with boy who has a girlfriend to be nothing new, but I didn't care because I was interested in the characters. Plus, the love developed over time. It's not like Anna saw the boy and fell in love with him on the spot, like so many books lately. There was a friendship that developed that turned into love, almost without Anna noticing. I have a soft spot for these stories for some reason.  The supporting cast of characters were interesting and not trite. Anna's quirks made her who she was and I liked them. They also were not too overdone or focused on too much. I enjoyed the development of the characters and their interactions.  There is only one complaint that I have and it was not enough to mark down any stars. I feel as if Stephanie Perkins pushed the no underage sex thing a little too much. I feel like she wanted teenagers to connect with Anna and then they would want to be a virgin like she is. I understand that desire to set a good role model for young adults, but the way it was done here just felt a little bit preachy, I guess. And it does get better on later in the book, but I felt like she was pushing that agenda a little too hard for the first part. I know things like this are subjective, so that's why she doesn't lose anything for it, but I wanted other people to be aware of that as well.
0525423656|4.0|In a society that dictates every aspect of a person's life - what they eat, where they work, who they should marry, even when they die - Cassia, made her first non-society choice between a boy that society has chosen for her (her best childhood friend) and the boy that society deems an aberration; untouchable, but suddenly desirable to Cassia.<br /><br />Ally Condie's Crossed, written from the point of view of Cassia and Ky, follows soon after Matched. Setting-wise we are introduced to different districts and lands outside of Society's rule. Ally isn't very descriptive in her writing so it's a little hard to imagine the setting unless you're filling in the space on your own. This isn't usually a problem for my imagination, but some readers might be put off by this.<br /><br />The narrative, from Ky's point of view, illuminates aspects of his personality that we didn't necessarily get to see though Cassia's rose-tinted glasses in Matched. It makes him more three dimensional and highlights flaws that were easily overlooked in the first book.<br /><br />Xander hardly makes an appearance, however, more is revealed about his personality and background through the other characters. I enjoyed the layer of complexity this brought to the story.<br /><br />The story was well-paced; I was hoping that Cassia and Ky's paths would intersect early in the narrative and found the timing for this to be just right. Still, I wished there was more Xander, I've always found his character to be more interesting than Ky's - from his introduction in Matched, Xander has always been the one I viewed as the bad-boy/risk-taker due to his citizen status.<br /><br />While Crossed did a good job in setting up the final book of the trilogy, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. I'm curious to see how Ally Condie will tie them all up and am looking forward to the conclusion of Cassia's story.
0525423656|3.0|I didn't really like the first book all that much, but I liked it enough to want to see what happens. I was hoping this book would be better, but sadly, it might have been worse. There was really no story progression and it lacked the love story that we were waiting for. The book has a very abrupt ending and I am not sure that I care enough to buy the next book (especially at $10+).
B000002KO3|5.0|Although all of them are good this one is my favorite. It shows their creativity and direction with sound the best. When I think of Talking Heads I always think of this one and \\"Once in a lifetime\\".
B004184JZO|5.0|Revoltech quality meets Aliens to make the perfect baby. All joints are firm, socket-based that can be pulled off with ease (if necessary). The package itself was beautiful (despite being in Japanese/unreadable) and is perfect for display inside the box. It comes with an awesome display stand with an Alien egg. I can't get over the amount of detail put into this figure. It's translucent on all appendages with incredible care of sculpting every detail right down to the supplemental back spike (that was later removed in future variants of the creature).   I'm a huge Alien fan and collector. I would probably rate this as the BEST Aliens toy I've ever had the privilege to own. I own several others, including some 8\\" NECA figures and the Alien Micromen figures from AVP. The pictures here are straight from the package, but don't be fooled. The toy's size is literally 5\\" tall or so. It comes with 2 different sets hands for different stances. I'd highly recommend this toy to anyone looking for a high-quality product that's relatively inexpensive and perfect for display in or out of the package.
0393061310|5.0|I'd been told by a friend whose advice I value that I needed Guns, Gems and Steel in my library so I purchased a copy.  I haven't read it.  I will.  I can't really give a review of the contents.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|The second half of this movie definitely redeems itself from a beginning that is a bit sluggish and from a story that is a ret-con from it's comic book origins. In the end, the only real dissapointing thing about the movie is the way it introduced James \\"Bucky\\" Barnes, Captain America's sidekick. In my opinion, this should have remained more true to the comics. Nonetheless, this is a Captain America movie. And while Chris Evans didn't come across as Cap-like in the first half of the movie, by the end I found myself warming up to his take on the role. As an action film, this movie works well. The effects and battle scenes are well done. I was particularly impressed with the way Cap uses his shield in this fight scenes. This is even difficult to get right in the comics, but they got it right in this movie. There is a good villain, the Red Skull, and there is a more than satisfactory ending. As I stated in my title, the very end of this movie does a great job to set up for the next Marvel film, The Avengers.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|This 40th anniversary remastered edition of Aqualung is easily the most difference making remaster I've ever heard. The sound just jumps out at you and because of this, there is a freshness to this version that almost makes it sound brand new. Already a classic album, the sound on Aqualung now takes us back to those days when we listened to these on vinyl in all their rich analog glory! Ian Anderson and the rest of the band sound great. There are sounds brought in from the ends of the spectrum that as I said before, making listening to this album a brand new experience. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree did the remastering. His efforts on this and the King Crimson catalog have sort of made him the caretaker of these progressive rock classics. I'm going to go grab myself a beer, sit back and listen to this again and once again relive the music from this by-gone era.<br /><br />One other note: The 2nd disc in this edition is also a must have, but if you already own the last release of Aqualung (the one with bonus tracks), you will want to keep it. There are some differences in the bonus material.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I thought it would be impossible to do \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" better or at least somewhat as good as Mariah Carey's version, but Michael Buble definitely did it! It's very different, very Buble and simply lovely version of the song.  \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is another favorite of mine from this album. Buble's soothing voice is perfect for it.  \\"White Christmas\\" with Shania Twain is playful and flirty.   \\"Cold December Night\\" - couldn't tell if it's completely new or not, haven't heard it before and it sounds very fresh.   Great album!
B0034G4P7G|2.0|I ordered this product thinking that I would receive a two disc collector's edition of the Social Network, but to my surprise when I opened my package today I noticed that I was only sent disc one out of the two.

If I had only been notified that I was purchasing a single disc I would not be that upset but I feel like I was in someway cheated.
0316044695|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. This book made me re-evaluate myself and my life. I think about the stress I have daily and compare it to what these men have gone through. Nothing compares.  I always have a copy of this book at home or in my bag. When I tell someone about this book, they usually tell me they're going to pick it up to read after their current book. At that point, I usually pull the book out of my bag and hand it to them.   I saw a man in the subway wearing a Navy Seal hat and asked him if he had ever read this book, to which he replied \\"No, I don't think I've heard of it.\\" I pulled the book out of my bag, wrote my email address on the first page, and gave him the book.   I got an email a few months later. Here it is:  \\"Matt: I don't know if you remember me, but I was the guy you gave the book Lone Survivor to in hoboken.

1423140591|5.0|Firstly, I recommend this book to parents whose children are somewhat adverse to reading. There is enough adventure, monsters, and mayhem that some children will forget that they are learning through reading and will just enjoy the story.<br />I also recommend this book (and the Percy Jackson series) to anyone who likes Greek/Roman mythology and ever thought about what it would be like to have these ancient characters in modern times.<br /><br />This book is a continuation of The Lost Hero, which is said to be a spin off storyline from the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. This is the second book in this new series so far. The antagonist in this book is so fearsome that the Greek and Roman Camps, who have not known about each others existence for quite some time, have to get together in order to pull a win out of the bag.<br /><br />I am older than the audience intended for this book, and I absolutely love it. I have read all the books of this series, the Percy Jackson series and the Kane Chronicles series written by Riordan. They are well written, with a clearly thought out plot, but they are not so complicated that the intended audience would find them too difficult to read. The books in the Heroes if Olympus series are older than those in the Percy Jackson series. The problems are a little bit more grown up, and so is some of the language. I think it was intended for those kids who have grown up with the books, to stay on their developmental level.<br /><br />I would start with the Percy Jackson series and then come to these books because there is some background that can be gained there. However, I am not sure that it would be hard to pick up and start reading it from the the Lost Hero. All in all this is an awsome book, and is shaping up to be an even better spin-off series.
1466208686|3.0|The Interview process is good.  For data structure such as Hashtable, Array, String, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, recursion, sorting and searching, you learn them during your first year or second year in college if you have a major in Computer Science. The book touches each briefly and doesn't show you in code how each is implemented. Go and research in the internet or take data structure class at school.<br /><br />It has errors. For example, on page 72, O(X + 2X + ... + nx) is reduced to O(xn^2). Instead, it should be O(nx^2).<br /><br />Programming error.  On page 79, Stack pop method is as shown below:<br /><br />Node pop  {<br />  if (top != null) {<br />  Object item = top.data;<br />  top = top.next;<br />  return item;<br />  }<br />  return null;<br /><br />Are the item and Node compatible?<br /><br />After the execution of top = top.next, what happen to the previous top? Memory leak?<br /><br />For Collections Framework, the code declares the concrete implementation class as the return type in the method. Variable declaration follows the same pattern.  For example,<br /><br />public ArrayList&lt;String> merge(String[] words, String[] more) {<br />  ArrayList&lt;String> sentence = new ArrayList&lt;String>();<br />  .<br />  .<br /> }<br /><br />Would it be better to have it as<br /><br />public List&lt;String> merge(String[] words, String[] more) {<br />  List&lt;String>sentence = new ArrayList&lt;String>();<br />  .<br />  .<br />}<br /><br />On page 143, the finalize method provides advice as shown below:<br /><br />  protected void finalize  throws Throwable {<br />  /* Close open files, release resources, etc */<br />  }<br /><br />Will it close my file and database connection in a timely manner?<br /><br />Most of the chapters have 2 to 8 pages per chapter including code and questions.<br /><br />Again, I really like the Interview Process. That, in itself, has 3 stars!

0385523912|5.0|I first found out about this book on the Bob Edwards show and found the discussion with the author very interesting.  I knew that North Korea was quite isolationist, but this book really gave me a much better insight through the books characters.  It's amazing how the Kim dynasty has clamped it's iron fist on it's people for so long, and this book described that quite well.  One thing that I did find a little annoying was that the author sometimes described things more than once in following chapters. Overall though it seems to be researched quite extensively (as shown in the many references at the end of the book).
B0034G4ORC|2.0|Dreadful dumb movie written for 14 year old boys. Deadly dull, even as everything explodes around our heros. There are no ups and downs in this film. After the inexplicable mid-war intro to flashback beginning, and some of the most cliche ridden exposition ever, it's just a constant bang-bang-fest to the point of numbness. And then it slows down(!!!!) for some expected internal confrontation, tragic deaths of parents (the kids are alright... thank god!). Then after a rousing speech compete with serial numbers of the dead, they save the world.  Ho hum...

B005FVA3LK|4.0|20 years....wow. Much has transpired since Achtung Baby first graced our speakers twenty years ago, but what remains is a classic album that has stood the test of time. Now U2 has released the Super Deluxe Edition containing six CD's and four DVD's, there is much to like here.<br /><br />For the CD's we get an interesting mixed bag of goodies and not-so-rarities. Anyone who has been collecting U2 singles/rarities for a while will already own most of the b-sides and remixes contained herein, making the value of this set debatable for many. CD1 is the remastered version of Achtung Baby, it sounds good enough, don't have any complaints regarding the remaster. The same can be said for CD2, which is the remaster of Zooropa, the bookend album on the whole three-year ZOOTV/Zooropa roller-coaster ride.<br /><br />CD3 contains remixes of eleven songs from AB and Zooropa , most which have been released previously, though there are a few gems, such as the Triple Peaks Remix of Can't Help Falling in Love and the Perfecto Mix of Lemon, a personal favorite that was only released (AFAIK) on the rarer Stay single. CD4 is more of the same, eleven remixes of various songs from both albums.<br /><br />CD5 is where we begin to unwrap the audible candy a bit, while all of the B-Sides on this disc have been released, there are about a half-dozen rarities that most have never heard, though a few showed up in more brief form on the twenty+ year old Salome bootleg. Highlights are Down all the Days, using the riff from Numb, and a standout Blow Your House Down.<br /><br />CD6 is the grand prize here, Kindergarten - The \\"Baby\\" Achtung Baby. Here is the entire Achtung Baby album containing alternate \\"rough\\" initial versions of the tracks. This is one hell of a listening experience, and for those of us that have listened to AB too many times to count, it's a joy to hear the entire album from an alternative fresh perspective!<br /><br />The four DVDs included seem to be less of a treasure trove, particularly for those fans that have collected the most common video releases. DVD1 contains \\"From the Sky Down\\" documentary that recently showed on Showtime in the US. DVD2 contains 18 videos from AB/Zooropa. DVD3 contains some interesting shorter docs that most may have not seen, taken during the AB era. DVD4 is the widely available \\"ZOOTV Live from Sydeny\\" which has been available since 1994 I believe, first on VHS then DVD.<br />Also contained is a rather cool hardback book with lots of interesting art and other tidbits, and 16 prints from the AB cover.<br /><br />All in all a very nice package that should make fans happy, however the price would be my one caution on this, but for many that may not be a factor. Personally I feel that this set should have been around the $100 mark at most, but this is coming from a fan that already owns most of the material contained therein. For those of us that remember the era of ZOOTV fondly this set is a treasure that will bring back many great memories, and the rarer tracks and vids within add an enduring value to the overall package. 4.5 out of 5.the most common video releases.

1250004217|3.0|I'm excited to see that the movie for this novel is coming out so I have to review it! I enjoyed this book a lot although words like \\"entralling\\" and even \\"haunting\\" come more to mind. The story is set in War War II Paris and switches back to the present time where a journalist is researching the characters and their experience during a great round-up of Jews sent to concentration camps that was orchestrated by the French police and not Nazis. This round-up went unacknowledged both in France and internationally until recently when President Sarkozy issued a public apology admitting French responsibility for the atrocities that resulted. Once we know what happened to the main characters, the journalist's personal life and problems with it take over a little too much. To be honest, the entire  book made me feel depressed. The tone of it is hopeful but seems to enjoy feasting on the melancholy details of all the characters' lives. However, it's enthralling and a refreshing take on topics we already know: concentration camps, WWII, and the shame experienced by those who didn't do the right thing when they had a chance.

B004EPZ07K|4.0|Green Lantern was more than just another comic book movie.  The more recent of comic book movies, mostly Marvel comic movies, have been fantasy movies with a montage of great effects, adventure, drama, romance, and a hero with human failings that also celebrates what is best about humanity -- our ability to rise to the occasion when we accept the responsibility we have.  In a time of uncertainty, we need heroes, even fantasy heroes, to remind us the darkness creeps in and has power to cause fear only when human beings do not accept the responsibility that is theirs.  The story was a replay of the failed but gifted hero who finally accepts responsibility for what he might do and becomes a cosmic hero.  I greatly enjoyed it!<br />I have not yet had the chance to be disappointed with the digital copy, so no comment there.
0547258305|5.0|I wish there were enough words in the English language to describe how incredible Graceling is. It has everything you could ever need in a book: Murder, mystery, adventure, action, romance...um, shall I go on?<br /><br />Hands down, Graceling is easily one of my favorite books.  Ever.<br /><br />In the novel, Kristin (great name, btw) introduces us to a magical world where only a number of individuals are born with graces (unique gifts/talents). Our heroine Katsa, for example, well...let's just say her grace is giving ass-kicking heroines like Dru (Strange Angels) and Rose Hathaway (Vampire Academy) a run for their money.  Not to mention she's also a strong, well fleshed-out character and I loved seeing that play out throughout the book.<br /><br />While Graceling is quite the fast-paced adventure, Cashore managed to add so much beautiful detail to the story that I couldn't help but pause, every once in a while, to take everything in. I read the book on my Kindle and I felt like I was underlining every other paragraph! I love that!<br /><br />I think that Kristin Cashore's grace is found in her ability to articulate human experiences and emotions in a subtle, yet thought-provoking, way.  Cashore is definitely one of my writing heroes. True Story.<br />Graceling's magic will suck you in and you won't want to let go. I recommend it HIGHLY.  So, stop what you're doing and go buy it.<br /><br />Now.<br /><br />Go!<br /><br />I'll wait... :D<br /><br />SQUEE ALERT: Kristin Cashore recently announced that the sequel to Graceling, Bitterblue, will be released in 2012.<br /><br />MUST CONTAIN MY ENTHUSIASM!!<br /><br />and my caps lock...
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Remember the classic Jeff Goldblum movie The Fly? Remember the scene in which Goldblums' character Seth Brundle realizes what happened to him (his DNA merged with that of a common house fly) and he jokes that he is now \\"Brundlefly\\"?  Lulu is the musical equivalent of Brundlefly. It is the DNA-level merging of Lou Reed and Metallica, a kind of Loutallica or Metreed.   It's important to note that because this is not Metallica. This is not Lou Reed. This is something different, something entirely new.   If Lulu had been released between 1967-1973 (the creative heyday of progressie rock) it would have been lauded as a masterpiece. For this is precisely what Lulu is -- a progressive-rock masterpiece. Not progressive-rock in the sense of sounding like King Crimson or Yes or Gabriel-era Genesis or ELP or Kansas or Rush (although Lulu could be the bastard child of King Crimson because it is infused with Crimson's bold, brash, unapologetic determination to progress, move forward, push boundaries). I mean progressive rock in the strict definition of the term.   Progressive rock only became a genre after the fact. Bands and fans in the middle of it didn't call it that. They just reveled, wallowed, and throughly enjoyed hearing the boldest, most innovative, and often the most bizarre and boundary-less music created to that point in time.   That's Lulu.   Lulu is the kind of music that Lou Reed would have made if he had Metallica as band mates instead of Velvet Underground.  Some of Lulu sounds like classic King Crimson music, circa Starless and Bible Black or Red (for example, the Frippesque guitar drones utilized most prominently on Disc Two).  I haven't a clue why the reviewers failed to see that Lulu isn't Ride the Lightning or Black Album. Of COURSE this doesn't sound like Metallica! If you can't accept that before you listen, then you're not going to appreciate the experience.   To my ears, Metallica has never sounded more natural, more creative, more relaxed. I hear slabsof riffage reminiscent of Black Sabbath (\\"The View\\" and \\"Frustration\\"). I hear a Neil Young rawness of lyric and riff (\\"Brandenburg Gate\\"). I hear the type of crushing onslaught of guitar tones and chord structures often found in today's European power- and death-metal bands (\\"Pumping Blood\\" and \\"Mistress Dread\\"). And I hear the aforementioned King Crimson/Robert Fripp drones that add a plaintiveness to the aural landscape. The album-closing \\"Junior Dad\\" is a great example. I love the extended drones that slowly fade the album to its end.   Lou Reed is not a vocalist. He talk-sings the way Rex Harrison did in My Fair Lady. At times, Reed reminds me of Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople, who also often talk-sings his way through a song. Reed's talent lies not in his singing, but in his brutally raw, often dark and perverse lyrical insights. He has offered up some of the coolest rock songs ever recorded (check out his live album, released 1974, Rock N Roll Animal. The songs \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" are bona fide classics). His work with Velvet Underground is seminal. VU was punk before punk rockers took off their diapers and left their cribs behind.   So a proper understanding and appreciation for Lulu has to start with a study of Lou Reed. Once you know who and what he is, you'll know what to expect from Lulu.   I have many words I could use to describe Lulu, and I'll share some of them with you: Brilliant, unexpected, ballsy, mesmerizing, new, magical, remarkable, haunting, poetic, challenging, ground-breaking, provocative, fresh, and deep.  I have never heard Lou Reed sound more powerful, or Metallica more comfortable in their own skin.   I've listened to Lulu about three or four times through now. Each time, I hear something new that grabs my attention. Often, it's a turn of a phrase, a particularly jarring word juxtaposed against another, or a passage of music that intrigues me. This is the kind of music I love -- music that bears up to repeated listening, that reveals more of itself to me each time. I even love how it was produced, with every instrument crystal clear. Frankly, I don't think Lars' drum kit ever sounded better.  I strongly encourage people to give this another chance. Don't think of Lulu as a Metallica album. Think of it as Johnny Cash meeting Rick Rubin for the first time. Or Seth Brundle meeting the housefly in his teleportation machine.   Lulu is Brundlefly, a new form of music in an otherwise arid landscape of homogeneity.   Thank you, Lou Reed. Thank you, Metallica. Well done!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I loved it. It was great showing his begining to pre-Avengers movie which I cannot wait till it comes out.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This young girl went through so much, and did it all with a positive attitude, which in my book, makes her a positive role model!  There is so much negativity in the world...who needs it?  She overcame with poise and calm and focus.  Amazing!  My daughter absolutely LOVED the movie, as did we, as parents.<br /><br />There were great extras on the disc with interviews with Bethany's family and friends.  Overall a great viewing experience.  I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone looking for quality and family friendly films.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This show is a 3 star movie.  Despite that, my kids were begging for me to buy it.  This was the only version I could get that came with a digital copy, so even though I don't have a 3DTV, it was worth it to me to buy it.  I will gladly pay the extra 5 or 6 bucks for a digital copy.  I am glad this did not come with the worthless Ultraviolet digital copy.  I will support companies and movies that include the digital copies, especially when my kids are dying to see the movie again.  Good Job Disney!
B0046HA24W|5.0|Bought these shoes for my daughter (yes, they are men's shoes, but she said they fit better!) and she says her feet feel fabulous on long runs.  We have both bought Brooks running shoes before, and they last really well.  She's happy with them, and if she's happy, I'm happy.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This movie is a fantastic show, and was a great finish to the Harry Potter series.  However, I cannot, and will not support or purchase any movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy.  I purchased Green Lantern and was surprised that I got a worthless streaming digital copy.  I live in an area where I don't even have 3g coverage, so I cannot stream my movie at all.  Then I got locked out of my copy by Ultraviolet and despite emailing both Ultraviolet and Flikster, I still cannot access my digital copy.  I WILL NOT be purchasing another movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy.  The movie execs are driving my business away.  Now I am looking at buying an Apple TV and just buying digital copies from ITunes.  The minute this is fixed, I will continue my purchasing of Blu-Rays that come with an actual digital copy.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|If you liked \\"pumped up kicks\\" then you will like the ENTIRE album.  Buy it, its well worth it.  There are many other songs that are good enough to be even bigger radio hits than pumped up kicks
B000000Y2R|4.0|I love this set, which I have on LP. But there are so many apparently different versions.  So,could someone please, definitively recommend which CD has all the tracks played that evening and has the best remastered sound?
B0055SWM08|5.0|it's original, fun, challenging, and just well made. pay the buck and support a great game maker. three more words

0823004325|3.0|As an art student I'm always looking for good reading material.  I saw this book \\"The Artist's complete guide to Facial Expression\\" and was attracted to it as 99% were 5 *s reviews. However, there was one really bad review.  I bought the book mostly out of curiosity on the one bad review.  Now I have to admit I agree with whoever wrote that bad review.  This book is pretty bad!  The drawings are horrible.  There is no real definition and most of them look like they have wrinkles and are very, very dark.  I am very distracted because my eyes only see black.  I can not even look at some of them.  I expected clearer, cleaner drawing materials.  The reading part is okay. Now I wish I wouldn't have bought the book.  Thank you.
0439813786|5.0|I felt very emotional reading it for some reason. Probably picturing if Hugo were my boy, how hard that would be. A boy with so much imagination and potential who is all alone in the world.<br /><br />This book expertly (perfectly, wonderfully) blends drawings and text to create such a beautiful and touching story. This book was recommended by my sister for us to read with our four year old. He is getting to the age where he likes to be read to, yet his attention wavers easily. It sounded like it was worth a try.<br /><br />My husband has been reading it to our four year old every night and our three year old daughter joins them (she loves it too). They talk about what's going on in the pictures and then listen intently to my husband as he reads the other parts. I love that they are using different creative parts of their brains and interacting with the book.<br /><br />The story is so wonderful that I read ahead of everyone because I wanted (needed) to know what happened to Hugo Cabret. I think older kids could relate to this story. Not every child has a loving family or an easy life. It's a great book to read as a family.<br /><br />Also, a few nights ago we saw that they are making a movie called Hugo, based on this book. The excitement on the kids' faces was a sight to behold. How great is it to be a part of their first book to movie experience? I can't wait to see it with them as a family and talk about how it was the same and how it differed from the novel.
B005XI94HY|5.0|I am truly in love with this album. I knew it would be great, as I am a big fan of Florence + The Machine, but it exceeded my expectations and then some. This album is amazing. Florence's voice is perfect, as usual. Her sound has matured since Lungs, but that's to be expected, and I think this album overall is much better than Lungs in a lot of ways. The songs seem more lush and epic, and her voice is more amazing on this album, going from soft hushed vocals to really belting it out, then back again, all in one song. There isn't one song on this album that I don't like. I have been listening to it on repeat for the last couple of days and every time I listen to it I find a new depth to it, and I fall that much more in love with it. Highly recommended for anyone who's a fan of Florence, her first album Lungs, or who enjoys good music. This album will not disappoint!
1401233376|4.0|[[ASIN:1401233376 Flashpoint]] collects the complete five issue miniseries.   My reading into the main D.C. universe consists of [[ASIN:1401226930 Blackest Night]] and [[ASIN:1401230016 The Flash: Rebirth]]. I purchased this hardcover because I was a fan of some of the New 52 titles and heard this was a prelude of sorts.   This book starts out with a depowered Barry Allen awaking at work. Everything he knew has changed. Batman isn't Bruce Wayne, the Green Lantern doesn't exist, and Arthur Curry is at war with Princess Diana. Readers of [[ASIN:0785124667 House of M]] will no doubt compare the two. The story drives forward from there, with Barry attempting to discover what happened. We learn that the villain is Hunter Zoom, the Reverse-Flash. This prompts Barry to attempt to recreate the accident that gave him powers to reverse the altered reality around him.  This book has an \\"epic\\" feel to it. As we see Cyborg and Batman debating the wrongs of killing someone in the first issue. Aquaman, who destroyed Western Europe in a flood, is constantly waging war against Princess Diana, who controls the United Kingdom. Global events play a large role in this, but only for a few panels. If this book were a few issues longer, we might have seen these issues explored more.   The art is great. Detail is everywhere. From costumes and faces, to buildings and machines. Dialogue is great, it's never too long or too short.  Overall this was a fun read for me. I didn't know all the characters upon reading this, but it didn't diminish my understanding of the story. Those who want to start reading D.C. comics, this is the perfect place to start.
B00013F38K|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT USED THROUGH AMAZON...WILL BE WATCHING THE EPISODES PERIODICALLY TRHOUGH THE WINTER MONTHS AND AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT....WATCHED ALL THE EPISODES ON TV YEARS AGO WHEN THEY CAME OUT AND LOVED THEM..EXCITING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEM ALL AGAIN.  THANKS
B001HN6922|1.0|I was so surprised at the violence in this movie.  My son (and I) ADORED Cars 1, and are so disappointed in the sequel.  This is not a movie for small children. I had to explain to my 5 year old, that Doc Hudson died, cars were murdered (in one scene you see the reflection of the murder while it is taking place), and cars were continually hurt or shot by other cars.  The graphics are of the Pixar superior standard, it is the violent content that gets my 1 star rating.
B005J29HD0|5.0|The music is amazing, the packaging is beautiful, my discs are flat as a pancake and among the quietest in my collection. Having initially listened to this album digitally, I can confidently say you have not really heard these songs until you've heard them on vinyl. I could not be any happier with this release!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Well worth the looooooong wait. Clearer and better organized than its bootleg stepchildren,this trippy,beautiful ride through the auditory menagerie of Brian Wilson's mind is a saturated musical pleasure.This is music for headphones or a long ride on a crisp fall day.This is a gift that keeps on giving....
B005ZWPR06|5.0|Smile is the Beach Boys long awaited follow up to Pet Sounds.  IT took 44 years and is worth the wait.    The music is amazing; it is a must-own for any rock enthusiast.  As a Beatles, classic rock, and Jazz enthusiast, I would rate it among the greatest rock albums ever made, if not the greatest.    I also own the Brian Wilson version from 2004 and was not disappointed in the least to purchase the Beach Boys version.  To hear the Beach Boys' voices and the 60's vibe is stellar.  The music is nearly identical to the 2004 version; the only differences are a few longer pauses between songs and a few short sections of new music not heard back in 2004.    I expected something brilliant, though unfinished, but there is nothing unfinished at all.  No break downs or unfinished songs.  It really was Brian's masterpiece.
B001CDZ40K|5.0|I love to collect cookbooks and am very happy to add this one to my collection.  It is a good cookbook but not for someone looking for a quick meal.  It is easy to see why Julia Childs was such a great chef.  It is a fun cookbook.  There are a lot of recipes I will try, as well as some I won't.  Overall it is a great cookbook!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Being a huge SMiLE addict for many years, I'm very pleased with this compilation. It's funny how close Brian was to really having this thing finished when you hear it. It's mostly missing some vocals on the tracks, but songs like \\"Holidays\\" and \\"Look\\" are such brilliant compositions, you don't really need any lyrics to enjoy them. The \\"Frankenstein\\" job done by the producers on this album is pretty amazing (like using vocals from demos to finish certain songs). I feel torn between this and the 2004 version. Obviously the angelic voices of the original Beach Boys are far superior than the vocals on the 2004 version, but I think the backing tracks on the 2004 version sound a lot better sonically. Some of the backing tracks on this release are a bit muddy at times, and I still prefer the 20/20 version of \\"Cabin Essence\\" over the one in this collection. Some cool little surprises that I've never heard on any bootlegs before are sprinkled in as well. Overall, this is a must for any Brian Wilson or Beach Boy fan.
0525423656|4.0|Society declared Xander and Cassias an official Match.  However, Cassia who had always obeyed the rules knows she loves Ky and nothing Society says or does will alter that fact.<br /><br />Ky has been removed from her, but Cassia vows to free herself from the work camps she currently is assigned to in order to reunite with her true love.  She assumes Society has banished him to the dangerous Outer Provinces where the undesirable are stationed to die as cannon fodder \\"decoys\\" for the unnamed Enemy to kill.  Cassie maneuvers Society enabling her to be sent to the Outer Provinces in search of Ky though she knows the risks are great and that Xander will demand his Matched mate come to him.<br /><br />This is a terrific middle book though nothing major is tied up and it behooves the audience to read Matched first to understand what has happened to the lead couple.  The story line is action-packed yet told in the diverse first person rotating between pessimistic depressed Ky and optimistic upbeat Cassia.  High school age science fiction readers will appreciate Ally Condie's powerfully vivid romantic triangle within a dictatorial 1984 like Society.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B005LZSJ66|5.0|Following along with kasabian tradition, this is yet another excellent production which houses a unique feel but a familiar beat. It's great for both background music as well as analytical focused listening.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|I watched Scotty from the very begining and just prayered that he would come out on top.  I love his deep and dreamy voice.  His talent and showmanship will grow with time and he but I think he is awesome now.
0525423656|5.0|Ally Condie's sequel to Matched, Crossed brings back our two central character's Ky and Cassia.<br />Separated from each other and sent to distant parts of the Outer Provinces, Ky and Cassia struggle to survive and also keep hope alive in getting back together. Cassia is in a work camp when she takes the ultimate risk jumping into a ship sending Abberations into a new remote Province. Taking this chance Cassia hopes to get closer to Ky and also closer to discovering more about the Rising.<br />Ky on the other hand is trying to survive through all of the battles taking place as the Society keeps depositing Abberations on old farming lands to keep an illusion of current residence.<br /><br />What really captured me in Crossed is how all of the characters paths are crossing and also at the same time dividing from other. Xander only has a few parts in the story but as he is also a vital character and we soon find he also has a significant secret that is being revealed. Ky reveals his past as well as his fears in the future which begin to tear Cassia's ideas apart and Cassia soon finds herself torn between not only the two boys but also what she finds out in her famous past and also in what she wants for her future.<br /><br />What can the characters believe in when at times they cannot believe in each other. Will they have the strength to overcome their fears and be able to fight for their futures.<br />What is the Rising promising? And what is the Society really doing to it's Citizens.<br /><br />Crossed is so much more of a fabulous read than I expected. As the story shifts and expands to more than just a tale of love, we find ourselves swept in to a story of a live divided and a place where war is not only within ourselves and our ideals and prior beliefs but also with each other.<br />There are so many things revealed about the world of the Matched Trilogy in Crossed so with the next book we should be stunned and expecting many surprises.<br />This series continues to astound me and explore many themes that I find exceptionally interesting.I find exceptionally interesting.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|This film is different from any other horror film I have seen. Once you get in the first 15 minutes of it, all hell breaks loose. One of the best foreign films I have witnesses this year.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Rear Lens cap fits perfectly and goes on and off easily.  Plastic seems sturdy.  I have no complaints.  It's a keeper.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I was majorly dissapointed at first, mostly because Mylo doesn't exactly have the artistic stroke we find in Viva.  After a few listens though, I began to accept it for what it is: an easy, feel-good album.  I don't think they were interested in attempting another epic, grandiose, dark and serious project like Viva la Vida.  I didn't like Mylo at first because it wasn't all of these things, but once I realized and accepted it for what it was, I couldn't help sinking in.  The songs are uplifting, easy-going, and not challenging at all.  Normally I prefer music to not be so easy, but I accept that that's just what they had in mind.  Above all, it's just ridiculously catchy.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|It is what it is.  A corporate controlled industry set to make and rape, while greasing the political pockets and spreading 'truthisms' in the meantime.  Thank you Mr. Fox.  From someone who grew up in the NE PA mountains, thank you.  Keep it up.
0670022411|2.0|Anne Rice's \\"The Witching Hour\\"? If you have never read this classic of witchcraft, it is much more atmospheric, interesting and way better written than Harknesses book. If you have not read the Rice in a long time, try it again...
B0007KS7D0|5.0|Muy buen super macro, es algo impresionante poder tomar fotos & con este lente puedes sacar unos macros impresionantes, estoy muy feliz de haberlo comprado.
B005974C94|5.0|I love this.  I can't say enough about it.  I first heard the Layla version on this album on NPR and was just amazed.  I thought, what artist takes one song and tweaks it to three different genres?  If you get the DVD too, you'll soon discover it wasn't Clapton's idea.  I love jazz and this is the best of the best.  This is the most fun I think I've ever seen Eric have.  He is genuinely enjoying himself.  I hope this album does for jazz what Oh Brother Where Art Thou did for bluegrass.  The music is perfect.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Excelente lente macro, al principio pense que no servía pero luego me di cuenta de que es muy estupendo, puedes tomar unas fotos impresionantes!!!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Purchased this after deciding I needed to replace my old VHS tape.  Love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves the big, period piece style of movie with a romantic theme... oh and Ralph Fiennes at his best, for sure.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|It's wonderful to finally hear the sublime beauty of these recordings, and contrary to what has been reported for years, SMILE is apparently not \\"unfinished,\\" as it seems that all of the tracks are compiled here (on disc 1) and it sounds like a complete, finished album to me.     But beyond that, beyond just being complete, what I listened to when I put on CD 1 was the work of a musical genius at his creative peak, backed-up up by the best harmony singers in pop history, and the best studio musicians of the era. It's pure gold.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|This product was actually purchased from Galactics and it has been a while since I got it. So far everything was perfect just like the first time it arrived. Just don't forget to get the latest drivers to ensure the best compatibility and you won't have any issues with it. I would certainly recommend this product to all of you folks that are looking for a reliable network adapter. Yes the price tag on it is a bit bigger than the average network interface card but the reliable performance and hassle free installation that comes with it would definitely be worth the money.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|I used these to hook up my iPhone4 to my home theater (Onkyo receiver + Paradigm studio 100s).  The sound quality was better than expected.  It replaced a cheap ebay bought adapter and both the quality of the cables and the sound quality are much better.  I compared to MP3s played through my PS3 hooked up with optical and I could not tell the difference.    Pros:   -durable, not-made-by-cheapest-Chinese-bidder-n-sold-on-ebay cables  -long enough so you don't have to sit your ipod on your receiver  Cons:  -the USB connector to power it is useless.  If it's plugged into your receiver/back of TV, you have to detach it to use it...which is annoying unless you have a correctly powered USB port on your audio device right next to your audio inputs...which some do but most don't.  Honestly, knowing this I would still buy it.  An Apple cable costs $30 and nearly all others I've found/used are absolute and total junk that I worry about shorting my devices I plug into them.
0439023521|5.0|THe reson that i started to read this book was because of how often i saw it in peoples hands. I got curious and decided to read it. I literly could not stop reading it, it was so good that i read it during school. (and got into trouble for it). I didn't expect it to be so good, i think the characters are very well defined and the author is very descriptive. I began telling my friend about it and as i was telling her some of my other friends drifted over to listen. So now nearly all my friends want to read it. it was entertaining for sure. What i really liked was that the sequels were also pretty good, because sequals tend to suck.It has romance and action. I like romance in books but not to much because then it becomes obsesive and anoying. I also like the whole love triangle thing, very scandolous! Especially in book 2 :D Overall i would definetly recomend it (I <3 peeta!)
0143038583|4.0|I knew almost nothing about the growth of food in America prior to the reading this book. I thought it was interesting and easily accessible book. I found the first few parts very interesting, and a good way to explore different ways to feed the population. However, the last portion on him creating his own meal appeared to be more of a personal diary entry than an argument or discussion on the benefits for the population as a whole. As even he said, he knew that hunting and gathering is not a realistic way to feed the population of the world. Regardless, it is a good read overall.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|After seeing her concert, I had to buy the cd.  Burning certain singles just isn't enough.  She is a true artist and musician!  I can't wait for her to release her next one.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|Could it have been the \\"Same Old, Same Old\\"? Yes.<br />Was it?  NO!!!!!!<br />This is a GREAT, NEW TAKE on a well-worn theme.<br />FINALLY!!!!!<br />Thank you, Amazonians, for recommending that the subtitles be turned on.<br />It really helped with the accents and slang.<br />I really enjoyed this movie!!
B005J29HD0|4.0|So let the debate begin.  Had this been released in early 1967, would it have become the milestone that all Pop albums released afterwards be judged against?  It's still not totally complete-at least compared to Brian's 2004 effort-but definitely enough to get a complete picture on the intention.  Aside from the excellent songwriting and performances, what's really astounding is the production technique.  This project was produced without the aides of today's technology i.e. digital recording and mastering which are now taken for granted. The production is stunning even in mono.  Had the original release date been realized the packaging alone would have been ground breaking-gatefold, inserts, lyrics..all uncommon for albums at that time.  Finally I think Brian Wilson can rest assured that he can close the book on the SMiLE saga once and for all. We are none the wiser.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I think the three O's in the title of this record are secretly massive testicles and/or ovaries.  Why do you ask?  Because the thing I love about Coldplay and this album is that they are not afraid to evolve, take risks, and experiment, and they have done so with great success.  If you are looking a duplicate of the Coldplay you fell in love with in 01/02, this is not that album, but please don't let that blind you from the quality of this one.  I am truly convinced that the best bands gradually evolve over time and that is exactly what Coldplay has done (and done very well).   A couple additional thoughts on the album:  1. One of my favorite things about the 'VLV' album was the flow to the whole thing.  While each song was unique and distinct, there was a flow and narrative-like feeling to the whole album.  This album has that same great quality.  The album is very easy to listen to (if that makes sense).    2. Amazing usage of Rhianna in Princess of China.  If you told me a few years ago that Coldplay would be doing a song with her, I would have been a skeptic.  Bottom line, they absolutely killed it on this song.  It is amazing.  3. The longer I listen to the album, the more i like it.  If you are not to thrilled your first or second listen through, just wait.  Give your expectations a little time to catch up with what you're listening to.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I don't have a long history of comic book fascination but I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in \\"bigness\\" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides \\"The Avengers\\", which looks very promising!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|This is the type of music I can't listen to with my friends. It's like a guilty pleasure for me. I love Coldplay and have since the begining, but two or three dudes listening to it in a car just doesn't work out. That being said, this band is still very creative and progressive. This definately isn't their best album, but it's by far their most interesting.
1908117230|5.0|Great book, great price from The Book Depository.  Highly recommended.  Fantastic recipes and great pictures.  Some of the recipes are kind of odd, but there are a lot of amazing recipes in there.
B005P89F1C|5.0|This DVD has been played repeatedly since it was received!<br /><br />The Christmas tracks are beautiful.  Bieber did a great job with Mariah, Usher, Boys II Men...and the behind the scenes footage of Under the Misletoe video and video Pray on the second CD were great!<br /><br />Catchy songs of old and new.  Sure to be another way to immortalize this young superstar in every Holiday season!

1609611543|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and it only added to my resolve to get wheat OUT of my life.  Our family has had 2 children with autism-type symptoms; and I and other family members by mid-40s have had high cholesterol and high triglycerides and C-reactive protein, and an assortment of other diseases such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), anxiety, arthritis pain, heartburn to the point we had to take medication every day, acne, it goes on and on.  But NO traditional physician has ever told us that we should try avoiding wheat, even for a trial.  Until recently.  I was tested and found gluten intolerant a year ago (although I already knew I was).  The result of going OFF wheat in 2011, at age 59, are:    1.  No more heartburn.  Ever.  No need to take the harmful heartburn medications I couldn't live without before.    2.  Clearer skin.  3.  Elimination of \\"ruddy\\" complexion my doctor called \\"rosacea\\" (and his medication treatment never did work)  3.  My cholesterol has dropped from 249 to 194 with no medication.  In just a few months!  4.  Triglycerides under 100  5.  Low C reactive protein of .8  6.  Less arthritis aches and pains  7.  Reduction of anxiety and no more irritable bowel syndrome  Incidentally, the result of greatly reducing rice and other \\"non-gluten\\" grains over the last 3 months, substituting protein shakes containing greens, avocado, kale; and frequent roasted veggies; plenty of chicken and yes beef:   1. Loss of noticeable belly-fat and much easier weight loss  2. Far less cravings  3. Further clearing of my skin  4. Silkier hair  5. Improved mood  6. Noticeable reduction of arthritis pain  7. Further reduction in total cholesterol to 181 with no medication.  8. Clear thinking and memory improvement  The food and pharma industries have had their \\"profit-motivated\\" way long enough!  Americans, stop buying those foods that do nothing helpful and actually HARM you (including whole wheat) by causing inflammation, poor lipids, and obesity! And see if youcan get off the statins, antacids, anti-anxiety medications, and possibly even your anti-depressants.

B0045TYDNC|5.0|It's a rear lens cap.  You don't realize how important your rear lens cap is until you get a 3rd party lens cap that has one particular way that it goes on the back of your lens.  When you're struggling to change lenses, you just want the cap to get on the back of the lens as fast as possible, without having to line things up.  This lens cap accomplishes that and seems to be a very good lens cap. A definite upgrade over my third party lens cap.
B002PNAY9C|2.0|This book was a disappointment, loads of random stuff but some cool revelations.  The characters become shallow, the philosophical depth is farcical and all the characters take a nosedive.  But the moment when Eragon's sword is being forged is very well-written and thought out. It is a pleasure to read. The action scenes are also nice, but hastily stitched with a weak plot-line. The Sloan scenes was just crap and there for no rhyme or reason.  Overall, not a good book unlike 1 and 2.  BTW, This is from the Omnibus Edition (Books 1&2&3), but the other books are nice so I have written about this book here
B005AUWY2W|2.0|Cars 2 was a major disappointment.  I don't know if the writers for the movie changed from the first one to this one, but the first Cars movie was delightful and well written and targeted for children.  The Cars 2 movie had a story line way too advanced for smaller children and couldn't even hold the interest of our older grandkids.  Our younger grandkids had no real interest after we watched half the movie and the older grandkids were bored to no end and so were we, and we were huge fans of the first Cars movie.  If we decide to \\"preserve\\" a copy of this Cars 2 movie, we'll just wait until it comes on Pay for View and record it, we sure won't be wasting money to buy it.
1451648537|5.0|[[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]A wonderful book for those who can identify with boyhood fascination with radio, electronics and technical things.  I didn't want to put it down.  All the way through I kept wondering how a person who altho a genius and a jerk, with apparently no desire to be lenient or understanding of the people who worked for him could develop what is in my estimation the world's best, most outstanding customer service!<br />I have asked a couple of the people who deliver that service by phone to people like me who have questions and problems to be solved.  They told me that he established very high standards of conduct - things like always asking when you call for your first and last name and usually what phone number you an be reached at in case connection is lost.<br /><br />So I guess he knew what he wanted in the way of customer relations just as he did in the quality and features of the fantastic products he developed.  And he made sure the customer relations were handled the way he specified.<br /><br />For a person who went through the nightmare of trying to get technical help over the phone from someone in India who could hardly be heard or understood, I can only say thank you Steve Jobs!  You have set the standard and I hope your successors have the sense and good judgement to keep it going!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|First off, this IMO is better than any of the other handheld sharpeners out there.  It's 3-in-1. It has what you need to put a respectable, usable edge on your knife.  Razor sharp edges? Only if you have the skill. For the average user this will be what you need to get your favorite knife back up and going.  Buy one, you have NOTHING to lose.
0525423656|4.0|I loved Matched, and I was a little nervous Crossed wouldn't live  up to my high expectations. I'm happy to say it met and exceeded them.<br />Crossed takes the characters we got to know in Matched and gives us even more of their stories. Cassia grows into the strong and decisive person we saw hints of in Matched, Xander proves to be an even more complex character than I first believed even though we don't see much of him in this book, and Ky's backstory is more fleshed out. There are new characters added as well, each with his or her own complicated and intense personal reasons for wanting to fight against the Society.<br />I really admire how Ally Condie shows the deepening of Ky and Cassia's relationship, complete with insecurities, hurts, and doubts. Her portrayal of imperfect and flawed young people who still love each other is a refreshing change from the common YA couples who seem to be together for no reason other than one or both of them thinks the other is hot.<br />The book remains character driven, like Matched, although there is more action in this book. I loved all the little surprises and bits of info Condie wove through the book that answered questions from Matched and also set up more discoveries to come in book three. While I would've liked a little more info and explanation about the Society, the Enemy, and how the Rising operates, I have faith Condie will wrap it all up in the final book.<br />Finally, I would like to say how much I admire the cleanness of this book. No profanity, no drinking or drugs, no sex. It would be appropriate for even younger teens. Themes  of love, duty, sacrifice, loyalty, honor, regret and redemption are explored and handled beautifully. I can't wait to see what happens next.

B005TQACLC|5.0|Britney Spears' Femme Fetale concert was amazing. She had a great mix of songs and some of the songs include Baby One More Time, The Big Fat Base, Til the World Ends, How We Roll, Hold It Against Me, Up and Down, If You Seek Amy, plus several other songs. Her costumes were amazing as ever and so were her special effects. She really kept the crowd entertained throughout the entire concert. I also loved how her concert told a story with the videos that were shown before some of the songs. My ONLY regret about this concert is that it wasn't long enough :)  If you are a fan of Britney Spears then you have to add this blu ray to your collection.

B0041KKYH4|4.0|2011 has been an above-average year for female-driven comedy, with recent films like \\"Bridesmaids\\", and \\"What's Your Number\\", proving to be the good and the bad. Today, we have \\"Bad Teacher\\", a Cameron Diaz film that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.  It follows Elizabeth Halsey, a morally corrupt middle-school English teacher, whose plans to quit her day job, to be a kept woman, were derailed. She's not necessarily a bad person, in my eyes, but she really shouldn't be teaching. She drinks, smokes weed, and puts on movies for her class, on the first day of school. She plays films for her class about good teachers, like \\"Dead Poets Society\\" and \\"Freedom Writers\\", while she pours airplane bottles of vodka into her coffee mug, ignoring her students completely.  All of this is very funny to me, because this part of the movie is pretty well-conceived. Cameron Diaz gave a great performance, and proved herself to have above-average comic timing. She isn't to blame for where \\"Bad Teacher\\" went wrong. It leaves this viewer underwhelmed, at a film that should have been a lot funnier. However, it isn't necessarily a bad movie either. It's just never as funny as it should be.   Written by \\"The Office\\" alums Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, the film slightly resembles a long episode of \\"The Office\\" - something that has a brilliant concept, and the fully capable actors, however, it never really comes together in the end. However, there are a lot of reasons why this movie did work.  One being that it makes pretty good use of the time that it's given. It runs about 90 minutes, on the dot, and it feels full and decently conceived. One big reason is Cameron Diaz, proving herself not to be just a pretty face, but something of a cunning comedienne. She plays one of the most detestable characters that American cinema has recently seen, however, the audience can't help but root for her.   However, when the movie approaches moments of golden politically incorrect humor every so often, it's not what it should have been. A standard has been set for R-rated comedy films in the past few years, by films like \\"Knocked Up\\", \\"The Hangover\\" and \\"Bridesmaids\\", showing that there's a new point-of-no-return for comedy. This involves raunchy humor, yet it proves every so often, that new comedic punchlines and ideas haven't run dry.  However, \\"Bad Teacher\\" shows us nothing we haven't seen before, recycling jokes from other (and better) movies. From a lame school car-wash scene, to a borderline degrading subplot about a boob job, there isn't enough good to outweigh the bad. As I said, it has its moments, but there aren't enough of those moments to make this a great film.  Grade: B-
B00005JKG9|1.0|This movie is so boring.  The first 45 minutes take place in the rain at night.  Great cast but the whole movie is just dumb.  No action at all, dumb story, unrealistic plot.  Can I please have the last 90 minutes of my life back?
B00138H146|5.0|One of the greatest live album ever bar none? Listen to this and you will find that there are not that many concert albums that can touch this in terms of drama and effect. Granted most Velvet Underground snobs hate it because of the \\"rock outs\\" and the the extended guitar play of Wagner and Hunter. You sense in addition that Reed had been spending quite a bit of time with David Bowie and some \\"rock god\\" influences have rubbed off. Yet \\"Rock n Animal\\" demonstrates that Reed was one of the great chameleon's of rock and could turn his hand to just about anything he wanted whether it be the avant garde to heavy metal.<br /><br />Whilst we can all salute and recognise the Velvets groundbreaking heritage and his great work with Nico and Warhol this should not distract from your enjoyment of this monster live album. The band is tighter than a shark with lock jaw, Reed's singing is fantastic and unlike \\"Take no prisoners\\" his endless and frankly irritating monologues are absent. The crowd are also well trained with no whooping or howling out of place. Clearly an audience who love the material and add to the occasion. I dare anyone not to marvel at the brilliance of \\"Sweet Jane\\" as Hunter and Wagner do an extended jazzy intro to be joined half way through by Lou Reed walking on stage to the crunchiest riff of all time and the audience losing the plot. \\"Heroin\\" is stunning and builds to such a crescendo you feel exhausted at the end of it. The best ever version of \\"Rock n Roll\\" is also included for good measure. All in all Reed doing what Reed does best, surprising the audience and moving the goalposts.

0670022411|5.0|I read this book for a book club I just joined and I thought it was wonderful. A little slow in the beginning with all the background, but it gets good quick. I've tested the waters with Twilight and I felt \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" was a much better source of entertainment. I related to the main character Diana being in a relationship that was forbidden and the Matthew in the book is just like my husband, who has the same name. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This set is simply great.  However, I will not talk about the music. I like to share my thought on the rampant Piracy/counterfeit.  A few days  ago, I bought a set that  turn out to be a fake.  When I bought it, the seller assured me that I would be pleased.  I guess he meant surprised and indeed I was.  So, I bought my second set from Amazon, I am not wasting my time with the chap fake copies, since ther is no way to tell who is who.<br /><br />Also, I want to caution people on the new modality.  I was buying the disc individually, and I bought 7 from a seller that stated like new.  Well, it turns out that all of the were also fakes. Since everyone knows about the fake sets, I guess now they are breaking the sets and selling tthe cd's ndividually!  So, pay close attention to your disks, look at the the cardboard printing, at the cd itself, at the matrix.  Examine them carefully.<br /><br />i have noticed an interesting practice on the individual discs being sold. Most sellers are selling imports.  Remember, imports do not compare to the USA or the Japanese CD's.  You will be getting cd's from brazil, argentina and other strange places that are cheaper than the USA/Japanese cd's.  So, be very careful with the 2009 beatles remastered sets or individual discs.<br /><br />Seems that some sellers only care of making a quick buck, their descriptions for the most part are just pat in the back, telling you how great they are, but neglecting to tell you about the item they are selling!  The description is intended to describe the product.  At this point, non of the individual Beatles 2009 Rematers Have an import category,  therefore,  all the cd's sold should be Made in USA. If the description does not state where the cd's were and you get something other than a Made in USA pressing, the only non-import maker.  This is an article that is not as described! Ask the sellers were the cd's are made from.<br /><br />Finally, I had a seller tell me that a scrtched fake cd was like new just because it played in his computer.  Be carefull with gradings, make sure that you are aware of what each grade stands for.  My advise, trust no one, only accept USA CD's and research, research and research.  The info is out there and just take you time, but it will save you headaches down the road.  It would be embarrasing, to say the leat that sometime in the future you find that you bought junk!puter.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Cette édition d'Alien Anthology est magnifique, bien mieux que l'édition avec l'oeuf. On retrouve les versions cinéma et versions longues des 4 volets ainsi que 2 Discs de bonus: Alien Anthology Making et Archives, au totale 6 BDs. Attention dans ce coffret il n'y a pas de zone B!!  Par contre, chaque disc est disposé dans une sorte de demi rangement cartonné, ce qui ne rend pas l'accès facile pour le sortir et à la longue risque de le rayer. Je n'avais jamais vue ce genre support et j'espère ne pas en revoir. Mais, encore une fois cette version est vraiment belle, le coffret est en Foil-Etched carton rigide est comporte de très belles illustrations de chaque épisodes. Dommage qu'en France, nous n'ayons pas eu droit à une telle édition. A posséder pour les fans de la saga.  Amazone devrait éviter les enveloppes à bulles pour l'envoi de ses articles car, le coffret a souffert pendant l'expédition.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Was at the cinema yesterday and had a great experience with this film. Loved it so much - lots of laughter as well as tears - very emotional and lovely and it was entertaining through all two and a half hours. People laughed out loud and you could hear sniffling in the emotional parts. The actors acted so well and the filming was wonderful and the music so underlined the era and the story from the original book was followed as expected, altogether making it a memorable evening with colleagues. I will definitively watch it at least one more time - to get all the details and enjoy the film all over.

0142419400|5.0|I've been in a huge reading slump lately, but I think Anna and the French Kiss has finally gotten me out of it! Whatever I read, I was feeling kind of underwhelmed, but with Anna and the French Kiss, it was finally fun to read again! So, first of all, thanks for that, Stephanie Perkins!   What made me fall in love with this book is Anna. Usually, it's the guy character that makes me love a romance novel, but in Anna and the French Kiss, I really loved Anna. She's not the typical protagonist. Well, in a way she is, but she's really different, too - there's just something special about her. She was so easy to relate to. (Although, that might just be because we're in kind of similar situations right now. No, sadly I'm not in Paris, but I also like a guy who has a girlfriend and says he'll break up with her but, well, doesn't.) I can't even explain why, but I could imagine Anna perfectly, and I felt all of her feelings. Her voice is great - Anna's way of thinking and talking is unique and loads of fun.   That's not to say I didn't love St. Claire - St. Claire is adorable! He's the perfect literary character - dreamy and swoonworthy but not so perfect it's unrealistic. His relationship with Anna is so... wow. The ups and downs are so realistic, and you can't help but root for them to end up together.   The rest of the characters are great, too. I loved Mer and Bridge and Toph and Josh and Rashmi and all of them - they're just so realistic! How realistic everything is is probably my favorite part of this book.   I liked the writing, too. There's a lot of dialogue and almost no description, which I'm not usually a fan of, but for some reason it worked. The dialogue is real, and especially the way Anna talks is so much fun to read about.   There is one thing I didn't like all that much about this book, though. The descriptions of the School of America seemed kind of unrealistic to me. I've been to these kinds of schools (not in Paris, sadly, but in general), and I don't think the descriptions of how small the school is, having only one teacher per subject and all, are realistic. Sure, this school is fictional, but still - it seemed a little like the author hadn't done her research on international schools well enough, which is something that always bugs me.   I don't have much more to say about this book. (Since I haven't been reading, I haven't been reviewing either, and I'm out of pracitce.) But Anna and the French Kiss is adorable, one of the most fun and realistic romances I've ever read. If you haven't read it yet (although you probably have - it seems like I'm the last one to read this), you definitely should, and I'm super-excited for the companion novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door!

Unfortunately, my results were different two weeks later, which calls into question the validity of the survey. They do say this can happen, and these results probably mean that the new strengths identified in the second test were actually in my top 10. OK, I'll go with that.

B004AKCME8|5.0|Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga' Hoole is a film that will satisfy you visually if that is all that you are looking for. The owl is a beautiful bird and this movie animates owls perfectly. If you need more from your movies, The Owls of Ga' Hoole also delivers. One of the themes of this film is the power of the inner self in opposition to the weakness of the external self. Legend of the Guardians shows the potential of the inner self, how far it can carry us. The movie also shows us the seduction and destructive nature of the external self. Following the external self causes some characters to risk everything to obtain a way of being that is unsustainable. Watch Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga' hole to decide which self you find more appealing.
