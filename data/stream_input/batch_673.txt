1416914285|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!  It's my new favorite thing.  It's basically Twilight meets the Matrix.  I was unprepared for how much I liked it.  I read pretty much every young adult book I can get my hands on, I have to, it's part of my job. Well, I started reading City of Bones when I woke up and the next thing I knew, it was dark outside and the book was finished.  I got to the last sentence, turned the page and saw a blank one glaring at me.  I kept flipping it over, hoping to will more words to appear.<br /><br />  Cassandra Clare creates a fantastic world of otherworldly creatures and amazing magical situations.  It is so well written that I forgot I was reading words from a page and saw it more like a movie playing in my head.  Clary and Jace (the two main characters) have great Mulder and Scully-esque witty banter that is perfectly sarcastic.  It's got Vampires, Werewolves, Wizzards, Demons, and some very unlikely heroes, and this is all apparently happening right in front of our un-seeing eyes!!  Throw in some anime and Star Wars refrences and you've got the perfect book.<br /><br />  I have to say that it is not at all limited to a young adult audience, and will be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good ride (perhaps on a flying Vampire motorcycle).  I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just say that I loved it and I can't wait for the next book.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|some people like the original incubus albums, the raw, more thrashy albums . . . i tend to agree with them . . . some people like the newer more clean cut incubus albums . . . i agree with them too . . . see, incubus is growing up, their making money, wich makes it harder to be angry when you know your family is takin care of for life . . . they get to concentrate on their musicianship and their lyrics.  I love fungus among us . . . but my fav album from them is morning view.  Doesn't make me wrong or stupid, just makes me different from the majority i see out there.  I love the clean cut sound with the clean cut vocals more.  Don't give me that crap about it being too much for some people. . . ive been to pantera concerts, metallica concerts (back before they were kidnapped by aliens and replaced by wussy clones).  I think incubus just sounds more confortable writing music for feeling then too see how harsh they could be, if thats what you want, there are litterally hundreds of groups out there doing it.  Rock N' Roll without gimic is what incubus does now . . . name 2 other bands doing that?  This is Incubus now, they have melody, harmony, emotion . . . and most of all talent.  Thats hard for some fans too grasp, the idea that there are more then 3 chords and 4 notes in the music world . . . but hey, incubus is just maturing too fast for their old fans who are stuck in last century's \\"lets see who can be harder\\" contest.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Unlike the first two Chrysalis re-masters (This Was & Standup), which I had a really negative reaction to (because the sound was not as punchy or well-balanced between vocals and guitars as on the original albums)....    This is a great album to own for true Jethro Tull fans, of which I've been one since my high school buddy (a jazz guitarist) introduced me to them, as a counterbalance to Hendrix and Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, Who, and Little Feat - to name but a few of the huge phenomena of the day. Only now I can see Tull as part of the Traffic and Moody Blues wave of truly melodic music, and as I read Ian Anderson's 2001 liner-note comment, it seems clear they wanted to keep their own voice while being immersed in the explosion of both British and American pop at the time.    All their albums offer some memorable songs, from quirky serenades to more classically inspired \\"rounds\\" and some truly wonderful acoustic guitar and flute interludes (not to mention their classic rockers and legendary \\"Aqualung\\"), there's much to choose from.  Benefit has the benefit (sorry) of recording technology having caught up enough so that this recording is light-years better than the first two re-masters, perhaps having more tracks to balance or re-EQ or whatever. Listening to this beautiful remaster of Sossity, for anyone who has heard it hundreds of times or more, is a pleasure almost worth the price of admission alone. The bonus tracks are from a newer recording age as well, a sweet and playful sound with great fidelity.    This is a winner in terms of the content. It's slightly different than the original LP I still have (and A-B'd against) with extra songs worth hearing, some exceptionally beautiful in their acoustic sound and melody, and some very punchy and clean classic Tull rockers too. It's a winner in terms of making it worthwhile buying the CD rather than keeping an old cassette or LP (or in my case reel-to-reel)...  it sounds like Tull and is worth a listen both for old fans and the curious.
1577314808|5.0|This book in many ways have forever changed the way I view myself and the world.  The author presents one essential and powerful idea, and approaches it from different angles throughout the book.  The idea is \\"Accept the present moment and the suffering created by your mind will no longer be\\".  Built on that idea, the author points out the condition of our environment as well as the misery in this world are a reflection of the domination of the mind.  The mind is a powerful tool that we use to solve problems and survive; but if we let it, this \\"tool\\" will try to overtake its host, you and me.  The mind generates judgmental thoughts, which is usually something like \\"something or someone or some event is good/bad.\\"  These thoughts becomes us; it becomes who we are, unless we become aware of those thoughts at the present moment.<br /><br />I initially found this book to be confusing and difficult to read.  In fact, it took me a while to finish it.  The book became easier for me when I realized the contents of the book should not be absorbed intellectually or in an abstract manner.  Rather, the reader needs to take his time to experience and digest the ideas presented.  It is important you take the time, whatever it is, to go through the book.  Don't try to wolf it down.  I have found it helps to consider the ideas presented in the context of your life experience.  You will probably find much of what the author says to be applicable.<br /><br />Lastly, this book gave me something simple that I can use in any situation in my life.  I hope you give it a chance. If you don't find anything useful here, there will likely be some ideas or events out there waiting for you, so don't stop searching.  Inner peace can be had now, by anyone.

0553260111|4.0|I'm not necessarily a big fan of Ludlum's novels and most of them are nothing special, but he sure hit a home run with this one. I read it when it first appeared -- having recently completed Le Carr&eacute;'s \\"Smiley\\" trilogy and concluded that no spy novel could ever match up to that masterpiece -- and became totally absorbed in the world and very short amnesiac life of Jason Bourne (a/k/a Delta, Cain, and several other pseudo-identities) as he tries to figure out just who he is, how he came by his highly specialized skills, what he's expected to do with them -- and just who is trying to kill him. And why. There's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that's necessary here, especially in Bourne's relationship with Canadian Marie St. Jacques, who is very conveniently an economist, and also with the bitter French general who appears to do a one-eighty in an extremely short period of time. But I can live with that. Nor is the movie anything but the palest reflection of the novel. This is also not a book to race through in a weekend, not if you want to appreciate all the tangential complexities of the twisting plots, but it's worth the effort.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|She may have been box office trash when she did this movie but like most \\"horrible\\" movies they have later prooved to be incredibly brillant! The chemistry between Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn is what makes the movie! If you like this one, The Philadelphia Story is definitely a must see!!
0743496728|4.0|Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes is not an easy book for many reasons.  Most people know its subject matter:  a high school boy who has been bullied all his life suddenly snaps and goes into his school, killing ten people and wounding 19 more.  Beyond the deaths, there are many other issues that make this one hard to get through:  the constant bullying, the revenge, the boyfriend abuse, the need to belong, the need to move on, parental regret, and so much more.  Picoult brings all of these things out and makes us squirm, whether from disbelief or self-identification, I'm unsure.<br /><br />From the get-go, this book takes off.  Told in segments of time that shift continuously, it shows how everything in Peter's life led to his moment of violence.  We see the events through several people's eyes, and we ache for them; not just because they are hurt, but because they are so obviously wounded in much more subtle ways.  Picoult takes the question of \\"Why?\\" and attempts to show us how we all could get there; while Peter's actions are inexcusable, they are explainable.  Meanwhile, we see his former friend Josie as her own life crumbles before her and we learn that being popular isn't always what everyone believes it should be.  How these two lives intersect over the course of the book is both believable and tragic.<br /><br />The main reason this book is receiving four stars from me is the ending; it's not that it's unbelievable, but more that it seemed to veer too far off course for what the characters had been capable of before that point.  While I believe changes can take place in life's priorities, I'm not so sure Picoult delivered convincingly what happened to those people she'd spent so much time detailing up that point.  You shouldn't invest so much in bringing characters along slowly and then having them react so differently at the last moment.  It just didn't wash for me.<br /><br />This book is definitely one that makes you think and feel; I have a feeling that it will stay with me for a very long time to come.  Overall I'd highly recommend it as long as those reading it prepare themselves ahead of time for how things play out.  It is definitely gripping reading.g that it will stay with me for a very long time to come.

B00004RF97|5.0|You cannot say enough good things about this movie!! Cary Grant was I think snubbed for the Oscar but Jimmy Stewart well deserved it too!! Dinah (the litttle sister) is hilarious! Katharine Hepburn of course shines and her presence is what makes the movie so fantastic!
B000O178BY|5.0|I'm speechless when it comes to this album. I wasn't expecting much but omg, With Teeth was a piss stain, this album is the real deal.  Don't get me wrong With Teeth was good but I couldn't listen to it from start to finish, it didn't have that weight but Year Zero, I find myself listening back to back.  It starts on a good note and ends on a satisfying one.  It wasn't until the album ended that I thought I gotta play it again and again.   <br /> <br /> <br />All 16 tracks stitch this masterpiece together.
080701429X|5.0|I was originally attracted to this book on the recommendation of syndicated radio talk show host Dennis Prager, who characterized it as \\"one of the best ten books ever written.\\"  I'm not sure that I would agree with this statement, but agree that in the massive history of book publication, in certainly ranks within the first one thousand. <br /> <br />Victor Frankl was a WWII concentration camp survivor and founder of the third Viennese school of psychotherapy, namely \\"logotherapy.\\" (The first, of course being classic Freudian psychoanalysis, and the second the Adlerian variation of this). <br /> <br />The book is divided into two parts.  In the first part, Frankl relates his experiences as a concentration camp inmate, and the internal psychological devices he used and taught to other inmates to cope with it.  Even a non-psychologist would be interested in it, especially those who perceive themselves to be suffering unjustly (such as any jail inmate).  These ideas later coalesced into a separate school of psychotherapy, logotherapy.  The second section of the book is apted referred to by the author as \\"logotherapy in a nutshell.\\" <br /> <br />I would characterize this book as one which you would want to read sometime before you die.  It is concise and relatively short (179 pages in my paperback edition), and is thus a relatively fast read.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart's \\"One Night Only: Live At The Royal Albert Hall\\" is one fabulous and remarkable concert. Imagine a venue that caters to famous and legendary singers, one of them was an icon of a singer Frank Sinatra. This stunning concert is a showcase of Rod Stewart's big hits as ROD THE MOD, and his bestselling Great American Songbook series as ROD THE FAB (the title I coined - short for fabulous interpreter of the Great American Songbook). He describes his GAS: Volume I as \\"an album that calms you down.\\" He added that recording it was a great challenge and he was so thrilled with the outcome. According to him, \\"it's so impossible for him to run out of these songs from the Great American Songbook.\\" He further states that he \\"could probably make six albums of these songs quite easily.\\" He already made four volumes, which are all bestsellers. I only hope that there would be an upcoming Volume V. It's a common knowledge that he truly enjoyed this experience so much and understands how much it means to him and to his fans as well. And he also wants it to always remain something special. The Songbook albums have meant a great deal to him and thinks that singing these songs has made him a better singer one can only hope.<br /><br />I must admit that I only became a fan of Rod the Fab when he recorded the standards from the Great American Songbook, though there were occasional hits he sung that really appeal to me like \\"Reason To Believe,\\" \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\" and \\"You're In My Heart.\\" I've watched one of his earliest television interviews with Katie Couric while promoting his GAS series. Ms. Couric asked him why he \\"doesn't look his age.\\" I guess he was sixty then, and he declared that some of his \\"secrets of looking young are . . . lots of music, wine and soccer.\\"<br /><br />His performances are in every way sparkling and dazzling as the brightest evening star, and so electrifying as lightning! He has the backing of a large orchestra and well-rehearsed musicians to make this concert the greatest gig of the year! He shares some interesting anecdotes, one of which is about his first guitar. His Dad gave him a guitar for no apparent reason and told him: \\"Why don't you take this up, there's money in this.\\" And the rest, of course, is history.<br /><br />While I'm thoroughly delighted with the concert in its entirety, my favorite parts are all his performances on the Great American Songbook. On these presentations, the London-born singer looking so dapper in his pinstriped outfit brings new life to these chestnuts with his excellent showmanship and his fabulous stage presence.<br /><br />My highlights:<br />\\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" - beautiful sax solo by Katja.<br />\\"Blue Moon\\" - the guitar solo is absolutely breathtaking!<br />\\"As Time Goes By\\" - an amazing duet with Chrissie Hynde with exquisite solos on violin by Janet and sax by Katja.<br />\\"For Sentimental Reasons\\" - a lovely performance.<br />\\"Reason To Believe\\" - one of the most notable performances.<br />\\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\" - a duet with Amy Belle who has a very expressive voice.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Rod Stewart is such a total performer and he could command your undivided attention whether you're listening to his CDs or watching his DVDs such as this one.<br /><br />What a fabulous concert!concert the greatest gig of the year!

Seems like The Doors plays into your room, I've got a lot records but the sound in this pack is the best.

Los Doors parecen que están tocando dentro de tu habitación y el DVD no tiene desperdicio.
1400079179|2.0|I read this while onboard a submarine, blissfully unaware of the buzz surrounding it, and as such can offer a view untainted by popular opinions of either persuasion. It's like a taste test where the participant does not know that that carbonated beverages exist. I approached this in a vacuum of opinion, since I'd never heard of it before catching sight of it in the book locker. I looked at it and determined it to be just another cheezy Thriller, virtually indistinguishable from it's equally cheezy Brethern: Robert 'the Milkman' Jordan, R.A. Salvatore, lots of Westerns. You get the idea.<br /><br />At any rate, it looked entertaining enough to warrant it's use as a time killer, and so I picked it up. The story was obviously not meant to be taken seriously. I was amazed that so many believed Dan Brown was attacking Catholicism! This is the comic book plot of a comic book novel; it entertains only so long as the reader can ignore the fact that a grown man in tights looks exceedingly silly. When I finished the book, I mentally gave it 2 stars--entertaining, but emminently forgettable. It deserves neither the accolades nor the attacks it seems to inspire. Would you kill for Oatmeal? Then why shill for a novel equally as bland?
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I haven't read the graphic novel. I expect this lends a great deal to why, for me, this movie was bloody soul-striking.<br /><br />I am a revolutionary, not an anarchist. Given the choice between statism and anarchy, I would take anarchy in a heartbeat. \\"V for Vendetta\\" is the tale of one man's vengeance with the ultimate aim to liberate a nation, and the existential journey of the woman who is forced to take his side. They are V and Evey.<br /><br />Incorrectly marketed as an action movie, this is more a drama and an obvious political commentary on the state of the world. To me, the most important aspect of this story is the journey of Evey, who begins the movie living a life of fear. Her journey begins with a flight out of terror, until she is forced the face her fear, and, eventually, her death.<br /><br />When at last she is given death, the growing parallels throughout the movie combine, until the visions of V's breaking and Evey's breaking unite in fire, in water, in screams and in tears. In this moment, I knew that I loved this movie.<br /><br />Others will follow what is purported as the main story until its end, marked by its own inspirational terror and beauty. The price of blood is blood, and the character V is one of flesh and blood. Knowing this, the end is apparent.<br /><br />To revolutionaries, anarchists and all those who have ever broken entirely only to find something \\"else\\" just behind the facet of life--this movie is waiting. To those seeking an action movie with car chases and bullets firing in every other scene, this movie will disappoint.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I bought this CD for my teenage daughter and didn't see the parental warning because it was covered up by the \\"Special Edition\\" sticker. Thank goodness I listened to it first! I usually end up liking some of the songs on my daughter's CDs because I end up listening to them all the time, but this CD is totally WORTHLESS. Even if you remove the profanity - which is totally pointless to begin with because it adds nothing to the music - the only thing left is a bunch of cheerleader music....and that's not what people have come to expect from Avril Lavigne. My daughter was eagerly anticipating the release of this CD and she is really disappointed. Shame on you Avril for cashing in on your name and releasing TRASH!
B00003CXQY|5.0|I was once an anti-fan of Disney. \\"The Emperor's New Groove,\\" by my reckoning, marks the temporal moment when Disney went wrong. So wrong that it's right. In fact, I am firmly convinced that those giving the green light to projects, as well as those clearing a project for release, were out of their brainwashed Disney Gourde when making and releasing this movie. Thank the Incan gods for that!<br /><br />To repeat the warning: \\"beware the groove!\\" Groo-oo-ooove... Never have I laughed so hard during an animated Disney flick. As I've now introduced this movie to so very man people, I had the opportunity of being there for my blood-sister to turn to me and ask, \\"I don't like this guy. Am I suppose to like this character?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, no you're not. Not at all!\\"<br /><br />For fun and adventure, my brother Tristan developed the \\"Emperor's New Groove Drinking Game.\\" Every time you hear the words \\"Kuzco\\" or \\"llama,\\" everyone watching takes a shot. I had to add this, as Disney accidentally left this information out. Everything else has been included.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I really am enjoying the \\"Folsom Prsion\\" CD by Johnny cash. The live element makes it what it is. Authentically honest. The prison announcenments during the concert are priceless. Knowing that Johnny Cash was not a \\"head in the clouds\\" person but a man who knew his shortcomings makes this cd even more real. He was a man who knew the power of redemption and it shines through on Folsom.
1400049628|4.0|When my friends introduced me to this book, I thought it must be a work of humor written to make light of the world we now live in. Instead, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the few books that have survived the trials of history, written long before the zombies and their vampire overlords left the shadows and engulfed the globe.<br /><br />These pages include extensive information on zombies. The author covers the virus that consumes a human brain, kills the host's consciousness and (shortly after the body passes) re-animates it into a ghoul--they who are the children of Nzambi. It includes ways to survive, areas to avoid and how to defend against the living dead. It even includes ways to HUNT them, giving lengthy details all combined with a sense of humor that can only have preceded \\"The Rise\\".<br /><br />To all those who still live, don't pass up the chance to read this book. It may make all the difference between life... and my machete thru your skull.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Jason Robards stars in this movie about an all-out nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and the United States.   <br /> <br />The movie is set in and around Lawrence, Kansas.  There is an air force base nearby, as well as approximately 150 nuclear missile silos.  All in all, this part of the country has a huge target on it's back.  The Soviets have invaded West Germany, and tactical nuclear weapons have been used by each side.  But these tactical nukes are only the beginning, as each side eventually fires off their ICBMs. <br /> <br />The lives of several families in Kansas are about to change forever.  Robards stars as Dr. Russell Oakes.  As soon as the missiles strike, he begins helping patients suffering from widely varying degrees of injuries.  Although injured himself, he, along with other doctors and nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams), continues to treat patients. <br /> <br />John Cullum stars as Jim Dahlberg.  He and his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) own a farm very close to one of the missile silos.  Their daughter Denise (Lori Lethin) is planning her wedding day.  Suddenly, the peace is shattered as the missile silo near their home opens up and releases its deadly cargo.  Eve is upstairs making the bed as if nothing is happening.  Jim is forced to drag his wife, who's kicking and screaming, to the basement.  Meanwhile, Denise pauses to pick up her wedding dress, which she'll never be able to wear, on her way to the basement.  The Dahlbergs are joined later on by Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg), a University of Kansas student who was on his way home to see his parents when the missiles hit. <br /> <br />John Lithgow stars as Joe Huxley, a professor who attempts to re-establish communications after the attack by placing a small receiver on the roof of a building. <br /> <br />I was eighteen years old when this program was aired on network television. I can still remember being glued to the screen as the missiles were launched at the Soviets while the Soviet missiles destroyed Lawrence, Kansas.  The special effects, including the billowing mushroom clouds, are very good, and the other aspects of the attacks, such as the onset of nuclear winter and the devastating effects of radiation poisoning, are handled very well, too. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie very highly.  The acting is very good, and the story is chilling.  Although the threat of nuclear war has greatly diminished in the years following the release of this movie, viewers can still get a glimpse of what could possibly happen.  Let's hope it never does.
0593055063|5.0|i read this book after reading the Da Vinci code and i was surprised. The plot was great, it had alot of twists and turns. its a really great FAST paced techno thriller that keep u interested. reading this book was like watching a movie ,every chapter was a different scene i the movie. its a great book
B000OWAFPE|1.0|I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup.
B000009O8A|3.0|about a subject that is just as horrific then as it is now. The four morons who raped her got what they deserved.  Then as today, they would never be convicted, a few smooth words from an experienced lawyer, and they'd be out in about 2 hours.  And she knew that and exacted her own justice.  Although, it was far from a pleasant movie, I feel it would be beneficial for all woman to see it and discuss what they would do in her situtation.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|To start, this album is not bad, but its not great.  If your looking for the Pearl Jam that put out Ten & Vs, well, those days are gone.  You have to remember that we are dealing with a band that is 15 years older and has taken their music in a completely different direction. <br /> <br />I agree with others that the bush bashing is getting old-- okay we get it.  Is there anything else to write about eddie?????  I'm no Bush fan, but find something else to pour your heart into.  We get it already. <br /> <br />This is not a must have album- its just another basic rock album with a few okay singles on it.  Nothing that will blow you away from start to finish. <br /> <br />Still, pearl jam still puts out better albums then these new one hit wonders that are getting all the radio play today. <br /> <br />
1594837929|5.0|This is a beautiful and romantic story of a young couple who fall in love after meeting at the beach in North Carolina during the summer one year. John is an Army Sergeant on leave and Savannah is a college girl helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. They notice each other for the first time on the boardwalk. Savannah's purse falls from her shoulder into the water, John dives in and rescues it while the Frat boys stand and watch. She notices then he is a caring and tender man, although not her type with large tattoos and a crew cut. Shortly afterward, they begin an unforgettable summer romance. Unfortunately, John must return to the Balkans where he is stationed. Additional stress is added because John is so far away and then later reenlists for another term. The book is about true love, commitment and caring about another's needs above our own. It is truly inspirational!
B0006L16N8|5.0|There's no denying the U2 influence on \\"X&Y.\\" Chris Martin's soothing voice, mixed with soaring vocals and a huge rock sound, are reminiscent of U2's best work over the years (see [[ASIN:B00006LIRI U2 - The Best of 1990-2000]]). Other U2 elements are present as well: hopeful but questioning lyrics, tight staccato beats, swirling or chiming guitars, a bit of piano, an anchoring bass and serious musicians who truly want to change and heal the world through music, one weary person at a time.<br /><br />Like Bono, Martin's voice has good range, and he can even hit the higher notes with a bit more ease (probably because he's younger than Bono and cigarettes and drink haven't yet ravaged his pipes). Also like Bono, Martin writes beautiful, transcending lyrics that really do inspire.<br /><br />\\"Square One,\\" one of the album's best songs, leads things off: \\"From the top of the first page/To the end of the last page/From the start of your own way/You just want someone listening to what you say,\\" croons Martin. Right off the bat, there's a storybook, conceptual feel to this CD. Despite his rock-star status (or maybe because of it), Martin sounds just as insecure as many of us; check out the fragile tunes \\"What If\\" and \\"Fix You,\\" for instance. \\"X&Y\\" seems to be an album about finding one's way in this tough world, taking risks and fulfilling your potential. Martin's sad lyrics are often redeemed by the hopeful tone of the album, and it's a rare feat to pull off a piece of musical work that contains such great songs AND meaningful lyrics.

0380789035|5.0|I am so glad I read the Author's preferred version!  It was an amazing book.  Let's see: very clever, well written, and interweaves multiple story strands and characters in sometimes surprising, sometimes touching, and sometimes horrifying ways.  Creative, thought-provoking, and makes the numinous touchable.  As a result, I have bought another Neil Gaiman book.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|I took a chance and rented this movie only because I like Ed Harris performances. And Diane Kruger is always in more substantive roles than lightweights like Cameron Diaz or Kirsten Dunst. About Beethoven I knew just enough to know his 5th and 9th. <br /> <br />This was a very enjoyable movie, nothwithstanding some fans' desire for better historical accuracy. I found the pace just a bit uneven, and almost half an hour too long; the \\"climax\\" at the end of the 9th symphony should have brought a summarial ending more quickly, as the last 30 minutes' devotion to Beethoven's last work dragged in my opinion, because as one unfamiliar with his works, I had/have no appreciation for the 'Gross Fugue'; even some of the other reviews agree--its' inclusion brought no benefit, even among those familiar with the history.  <br /> <br />I thought both performances of Harris and Kruger to be very good to excellent; it may be the best role Kruger has had of the three I've seen (Troy, National Treasure) and she wasn't lacking for acting ability. That the film was not focussed on Beethoven enough for some viewers wasn't a problem for me; the title implied to me that the main story line was about someone else, and Beethoven was the \\"backdrop\\". Still, I would agree that the film does focus on an albeit fictional portrayal of a character that even I doubted was a necessary medium for Beethoven's genius. <br /> <br />One review hit on a point that sums up the movie's 'validitiy' very well for me. It intrigued me enough to make me curious; and I ended up here, surfing for more information about the movie, the facts, and the recordings. The 9th is the *only* piece of music I have that I liked enough to have 3 versions of--von Karajan, Maazel, and my favorite, Solti. Mostly I was on a quest to find a better challenge for my stereo system. I dunno squat about the conductor's contribution and interpretation of classical performances, but for me, Solti opened better than the others(not that I'velistened to a lot of versions of the 9th), and I've not heard an equal to Marty Talvela's baritone--\\"he belts it out from his shoes\\" doesn't begin to describe it--and without power, resonance, and depth, the individual vocals and choir in the 9th can kill a perfomance. This movie had me waiting to the credits to see what recording they used, and though it's *early* morning here, I gotta hear Solti after I get off the pc.  <br /> <br />I'd rack that up as a \\"USDA prime\\" for this movie--it spurred the curiousity in me.
B00007LTIA|5.0|What cracks me up upon reading the review of this supposed \\"dud\\", responsible for the \\"demise\\" of progressive rock and the advent of punk, is that for every negative review, there are at least 7 praising it as a masterpiece, and at least 3 holding a fairly favorable position. So, dear readers, make your own conclusions... Not to mention that most of the negative ones are so asinine that they can be dismissed entirely out of hand without risk. \\"Self-indulgent wankery\\"? Pleeeeease! Self indulgent wankery is that of people putting out records which readily betray the fact that their instrumental skill does not go beyond grabbing a firm hold of their instruments so they don't accidentally drop them on the floor. <br /> <br />Granted, this music demands attention to be fully appreciated, but great art always does. If you are looking for instant gratification, do yourself a favor and pass this one by. On the other hand, if what you want is something that you will be still listening to 30 years from now, and are up for the challenge, then by all means take the plunge, and do not be discouraged if it seems an uphill battle at first.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This was a wonderful film. It was well written, well directed, and well acted. But the film goes to Rolf Lassgard. I first saw him in the movie \\"Under the Sun,\\" and I did not recognize him as the same actor. He looked so entirely different. Although I somewhat enjoyed Under the Sun, I was disappointed in the script. However, this was a one-der-ful script. From start to finish, Rolf's character was secretive, loveable, loving, and very funny. I loved the way he laughed, and he had the ability to break my heart. A genuine and award-winning performance by Rolf Lassgard!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This film was almost perfect.  While not completely true to every detail of the book, it captured the emotional essence of it.  What I remember loving the most about the book is Elizabeth's independence and wit, which Keira Knightly puts forth in spades.  In this movie Darcy becomes much more of a passionate man than in previous adaptations where his sexiest feature was his house.  Bingley also turns from a lout into a sweetly awkward and humble young man.  The scenery was great, and the dialogue cut for modern ears (again a good thing) so that every sentence that remained was essential.   <br /> <br />If I didn't love this movie so, I'd dock it one half star for the excruciating, tacked-on ending (why not listen to the British viewership that rejected it).  Another complaint: not enough Miss Bingley!  She was such an interestingly horrendous human being, and played to new, icy lows by Kelly Reilly.  In the book, Elizabeth and Darcy's takedowns of Caroline Bingley are some of the most delicious gotchas ever.  That storyline is great, and fairly central to the Elizabeth-Darcy relationship; it could have been preserved.   <br /> <br />In any case, it's the most spirited adaptation yet, and the one that, I believe, most deserved to be committed to film, because it retold the story most vividly.
B000001EG6|4.0|The 2nd album from Elton John is the one where he first made an impact on the music world. There are two standards on this album 'Your Song' and 'Border Song'. Both are great songs. Sadly Your Song has been overplayed a bit over the years, but listening to the original version of Border Song again recently I was struck by the simple production, and its great gospel feel.<br /><br />'Sixty Years On' and 'Take Me To The Pilot' remain two of the songs that Elton still plays in concert to this day and any fan will know these. A couple of the remaining tracks are perhaps are not up to quite the same standard, but I like them all. The string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster set Elton's early albums apart from his more comercially successful albums and give this album a unique feel.<br /><br />The 3 bonus tracks are well worth having. My favourite of these is 'Rock 'n' Roll Madonna'. A rare straight rock n roll track from Elton with an artificial live feel and Jerry Lee Lewis/Leon Russell influenced Piano solo. The remastered sound is good and the new sleeve notes give quite a lot of useful background information. This is well worth getting.
B000002I6V|4.0|This is a great album that I picked out of my mom's vinyl collection to give a spin.  I had never heard any of Graham Nash's solo stuff, nor have I ever really liked CS&N (or Y for that matter).  So I gave this record a skeptical spin.  After repeated listens, however, I found that I couldn't help but love this album.  Here's a brief rundown of the songs:<br /><br />\\"Military Madness\\" almost kicks your teeth in with melancholy.  It's the \\"hardest\\" \\"rocker\\" on the album, despite the fact that it really is neither.  It is probably the best track on the album.  That being said, the rest of the album is still well worth a listen!<br /><br />\\"Better Days\\" is a middle of the road rock song with a plodding pace that really keeps the album on a darker path.  And yes, Graham hits those high notes (he pounds those high notes) like you wouldn't believe.<br /><br />\\"Wounded Bird\\" is a song that I usually skip over.  It's not bad, but it's not as exciting as the previous songs.  But it's also short, so it doesn't detract a whole lot from the album's flow.<br /><br />\\"I Used To Be A King\\" is a good song, still in the melancholy vein, but with the usual twist of hope that Graham offers.  This song suffers a bit from weak lyrics on the verses, but is made up plenty by the vocal virtuosity that Graham displays.<br /><br />\\"Be Yourself\\" is a song that I used to hate because the choruses (which consist of \\"be yourself\\" sung over and over) sounded so cheesy.  But when you consider that at the time this wasn't as cliched a subject as it is now in popular music, it's easier to swallow.  And the verses are pretty thought-provoking, actually.<br /><br />\\"Simple Man\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  It's a love song with some depth.  What I like most about it is the vocal harmonies on the chorus.  Unfortunately this song is only around two minutes long--I wish it were longer!<br /><br />\\"Man In The Mirror\\" is another standout track on the album.  Great, introspective lyrics, and wonderful melodies.  I would rate this the second best track on the album, right behind \\"Military Madness.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's Only One\\"--a song I usually skip over.  What's strange though is that even though I don't like the song, it gets stuck in my head all the time.  I think this is a great indication of Graham's ability to write super-catchy songs.  So, I don't like it, but apparently my sub-conscious (or whatever) does.<br /><br />\\"Sleep Song\\" is a pretty little acoustic number with more tight vocal harmonies.  Not as good as \\"Simple Man\\", but it serves as a good mood setter for the last songs.<br /><br />\\"Chicago\\" rips you out of the dreamy \\"Sleep Song\\" and shoves a decision in your face: won't you please come to Chicago?  Even for those such as I who have no connection whatsoever to the political climate of the 70s can understand Graham's rallying cry: WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD!  The chorus reprises for \\"We Can Change the World.\\"  A great end to a great album.<br /><br />I would suggest that anyone who likes soft rock, thoughtful lyrics, excellent harmonies, and moving melodies get this album.  It's a wonderful album that I could play over and over again.e lyrics, and wonderful melodies.

0440178002|5.0|I first read this novel not long after it was first published in 1975, and have just finished rereading it for the third or fourth time.<br /><br />By working within the historical framework of the times, James Clavell brings life to feudal Japan in a way that makes many of us thirst for a greater knowledge of north Asian history and culture.  It also made me question more critically the influences of Europe within this region.<br /><br />'Shogun' also provided me with a hero I could admire, some idealistic behaviour I could aspire to and some wonderfully real tensions between different cultures, beliefs and values.<br /><br />I have enjoyed most of James Clavell's novels, but none so much as this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000K7VHPU|5.0|My wife and I were weary of high-tech movies with endless violence, and very hopeful when we began to watch this story. We were not disappointed.<br /><br />Right from the start it engulfs the viewer with masterful settings and cinematography. Each scene is carefully framed, with stunning landscapes and interiors.<br /><br />The suspense moves quickly, starting with Edward Norton's intensity on a bare stage.<br /><br />Then through the love lost and love found and love forever (maybe). The interplay between Illusionist Norton and the policeman (played so well by Paul Giamatti) reminds one of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or maybe one of the better \\"Columbo\\" episodes.<br /><br />Watch this classic in a quiet place, with someone close to you, and maybe a dog or two at your feet.  Enjoy!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this production primarily because it followed the book quite well.   There were a few embellishments such as the addition of the twins discussion.  I have seen other productions of Jane Eyre that covered the period when Jane was a child better; but considering that the book is many faceted,   this production is wonderful.  I think Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson are well matched, and they created just the right amount of tension.   I have watched this many times and never tire of it.  I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />I have one question,  though - why was Rochester fully clothed,  including those high boots - when his room was caught on fire?   Strange.

B00003CXWV|5.0|I have to admit I passed this one by for quite a few months at Blockhead. I was intrigued by the stars, put off by the topic... until I read further into it and discovered this movie was not some drug culture self-glorification eulogy. And then I discovered it was about George Jung, the real life character who introduced Columbian cocaine so devastatingly onto the American drug scene. Rather than repeat the synopsis already presented in the Editorial Reviews, I'll just comment on the things that struck me most poignantly in the film.<br /><br />1) If ever a young man was influenced by his mother's faults, George Jung was he. George had the same personality as his father--hard working, good hearted, and loyal. But the father was condemned to a life of poverty, damned by his refusal to leave a losing plumbing & heating business. \\"Without us, people would freeze to death!\\" The mother, I believe, knew in advance that the father would never be a financial success, and that is exactly why she married him. As long as he was around never earning quite enough to satisfy her, she had a crutch, her eternal 'but-for.' \\"But for that loser, I coulda had a nice house. But for that bum, I coulda had new drapes.\\" This sick, symbiotic relationship did a lot of damage to young George. When he was growing up he did not have access to the pop psychology books that could have alerted him to the debilitating scripts that his parents wrote for themselves. The precise damage done to young George was in convincing him that adequate money could cure any shortcoming life might saddle him with. And that shortcoming leads me to Point 2, George's monster-wife-from-hell, Mirtha, beautifully rendered by Penelope Cruz.<br /><br />2) In marrying Mirtha, George married his mother. George was the modern day equivalent of the Greek tragic hero, Oedipus. The only difference was that where Mom needed a nice brownstone to wow the neighbors, Mirtha needed a nice palace--Versailles will do--to wow the jet-set. When George stumbled, and both the Jung men were genetically programmed to stumble, Mirtha, the monster wife, was there to rub his nose in it right on cue. Did you happen to pick up on the first two times George got busted? He was ratted out by first his mom, then by Mirtha. His mom did it not because she thought he was doing something wrong, but because she had to regain her stature in the community. After all, everyone already knew about George's drug doings, so what better way to shut the neighbors up when George came home for an illicit visit than to dial 9-1-1? However, when Mirtha did it, it was out of pure meanness. She was mad and she had to take it out on George.<br /><br />3) George was basically a good man in spite of his misplaced business focus, and that goodness was also his fatal flaw. George was loyal to a fault, not a good quality in an industry plagued by disloyalty. He'd been ratted out by his mother and his wife, so it stands to reason that the third time George got busted was when his closest, lifelong friends set him up with the feds. Where's the honor among thieves? Perhaps there never was any.<br /><br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Destiny of Fools\\", Aarhus Publishing, 2006stumbled, and both the Jung men were genetically programmed to stumble, Mirtha, the monster wife, was there to rub his nose in it right on cue.

0618680004|5.0|Scientist Dawkins masterfully points to the many flawed arguments of theology. Theology is guilty of perpetuating what the title of Matthias Beier immensely important book calls \\"A Violent God-Image\\" (2006), which is driven by fear and coercion. The only flaw of Dawkins book is that he underestimates the human need for some kind of ultimate hold. Just as thirst is proof for the existence of water so the longing for some ultimate sense of meaning in life could be seen as proof for the existence of the ultimate. True: God cannot be proven scientifically--but neither can love, art or music. There is more to life than science.
B000000OQF|5.0|There's a reason that this album from Guns N' Roses is one of the highest selling ever...it's phenomenal!  I realize that some don't like Guns N' Roses, though I'm not too put off, now that I've thought about it.  There's a good deal about this album that bothers some listeners.  It's too misogynistic, or too aggressive, or they don't like Axl's attitude.  Oh well...for everyone to love it, it would have to be watered down far too much, and I like my Appetite as is.  If your delicate sensibilities can't handle it, then bugger off and listen to some britpop for all I care.  That said, on to the review!<br /><br />Opener \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" has become iconic as the battle cry for hard rock, and for good reason.  It's got a great lyrics and a killer groove supplied by bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler.  But while this song is a piece of rock history, it's hardly the best or heaviest track on the album.<br /><br />Followed up \\"It's So Easy\\" takes on darker themes with lyrics about sexual conquest, though it doesn't approach them in the style of the day, which was very childish with a \\"boys will be boys\\" vibe a la M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e and Poison.  Rather, it plays as a heavier track that, while dealing with similar thematic elements, illustrating Guns' ability to take familiar ideas and deal with them in a completely new way.<br /><br />Fan favorite \\"Nightrain\\" follows, with some of the tightest playing on the album and an absolutely killer guitar solo from Slash.  In addition, Axl's vocals are on form, and work well with the instrumentation.<br /><br />\\"Out Ta Get Me\\" follows, featuring some of the best riffs on the album, before the killer groove of \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" takes over.  At this point you may be thinking \\"all killer...no filler?,\\" and you'd be correct.  This trend continues, as nearly every song has a strong guitar solo, awesome groove, and great vocal work.<br /><br />\\"Paradise City\\" marks the midpoint of the album and, despite being a classic, it's actually not one of my favorites.  Sure, it's great, but I think it could have done without the synth, as it makes it sound a bit dated and takes away from an otherwise killer song.  But despite its instantly recognizable guitar intro and catchy chorus, what people generally forget about this song is that it's actually one of the heavier ones on the album, and you'll notice that no casual fans actually know the words in the verses.<br /><br />The second half, which plays out as a series of songs dedicated to all manner of women (crazy, tender, cherished, troubled, kinky) begins with the subdued tones of a guitar melody of \\"My Michelle,\\" before breaking out into a heavy, groovy melodic riff to back some of the best vocals on the album.  This is an aggressive track...not necessarily in its tempo, which is midpaced, but it just has about as much attitude as a rock n' roll song can have.  One of my personal favorites from the album.<br /><br />\\"Think About You\\" is probably one of the two least known tracks from Appetite for Destruction.  One of two genuinely positive songs (in a row, no less!), it's one of the more upbeat tracks on Appetite.  This leads in to the famous \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" which is the closest thing you'll find on this album to the mid/late 80s trend of including a power ballad on every release.  This is NOT a power ballad.  Compare it to \\"Home Sweet Home\\" (Motley Crue) or \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" (Poison) or any of the others, and you'll see that this is a completely different approach.  It's faster paced than the typical power ballad, doesn't even think about going acoustic, and has one of the best guitar solos you'll ever hear in a rock n' roll song.<br /><br />\\"You're Crazy\\" picks up the pace near the end of the album, adding a bit of the frantic to the mix, before \\"Anything Goes\\" brings a heavy dose of groove back to the album.  This all leads in to one of the true album highlights.  \\"Rocket Queen\\" has one of the best grooves on the album, along with some great lyrics and an overall strong performance.  The song slows and softens with a little over two minutes remaining, into a great finish.<br /><br />There are a lot of things that make a band successful.  Guns N' Roses was a combination of punk, hard rock, and classic rock influences, personified in bands like the New York Dolls, Thin Lizzy, and The Rolling Stones.  An unlikely mix, in that the variety of influences could lead to very inconsistent albums.  Lesser musicians would have failed miserably in attempting to combine these elements, and a lesser band would not have had the right combination of instrumental talent and songwriting skill, on one hand, and attitude and aggression, on the other, to pull it all together in what has become one of the two \\"must have\\" albums in hard rock (along with AC/DC's Back in Black).  Not many bands had the guts to go against the grain, as so many were copying corporate formulas for success near the time of Appetite's release, but Guns seem to know no other way, which makes this one of the most honest albums around.<br /><br />If \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" were never written, this would STILL be one of the best hard rock albums ever released.<br /><br />Buy it for those songs, if you must, but worship it for the power of \\"Nightrain,\\" the animosity of \\"My Michelle,\\" and the groove of \\"Rocket Queen,\\" because a truly great album is so much more than its hits.<br /><br />THIS is such an album.nce.

'Hot Fuzz' is the newest release from the comedy team that brought you 'Shawn of the Dead' one of the most origional plays on the cliche horror movie. This time the world of action packed crime fighting cops is placed in the hand of these comic geniuses. There are so many things in this movie that made it probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen since '300'. One I just love British movies. Two all the hysterical dialogue even during the most tense moments in the movie that just make you snicker even though you know you shouldn't be. Three, the final chapter in the movie that takes almost every cliche moment from your tradition action movie and twists them in so many ways you will wet your pants from laughing so hard. If you haven't been to the movies in a while this will be your final excuse to go before Spider-Man 3 and the other much awaited Summer blockbusters move into theaters
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This is not just a great Catholic movie but a great movie in general. It focuses on the Pope's path to becoming a Pope. It chronicles his life in Poland during World War II and the Soviet Communism following. I saw the movie with my grandmother who was about the Pope's age about 50 kilometers from the site when Poland was attacked during the war and she thought the movie conveyed the times pretty realistically. Actually, that is also what she said she didn't like about the movie because it brought her back to the times she didn't want to go back to. As for me, the younger generation (I am in my early 20s), the movie was emotional, dramatic and involving. It is hard to believe it was someone's real life because it really reads more like fiction. The acting was great as well. Note: I have only watched this movie in Polish so it may be a different experience watching a version dubbed in English or with English subtitles.

B000GTLQXU|4.0|Remaking movies is a big thing in Hollywood right now, it seems like every time I turn around there's another classic movie or TV show that is being remade.  Sometimes these remakes prove to be inferior to their source material (\\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Omen\\" to name a couple), but in some instances they become equals to the originals, or even better than the original.  A very recent addition to the ever-increasing list of remakes would be director Wolfgang Peterson's (\\"Air Force One\\" and \\"Troy\\") attempt at remaking the classic disaster-type film \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" with \\"Poseidon\\" starring Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Richard Dreyfuss. <br /> <br />\\"Poseidon\\" takes place during New Year's Eve on the cruise ship Poseidon (hmm, I wonder where they got the title of the movie from).  While the many passengers on the ship are partying the night away to welcome in the New Year, disaster is quickly approaching.  A giant wave, apparently called a rogue wave, strikes the ship, causing it to flip over and many passengers to die in the disastrous process.  With time running out, and the ship slowly becoming a watery grave for all aboard, a small group of passengers struggle to make their way to the bottom of the ship (which is now the top for those not paying attention), and hope to survive. <br /> <br />Remaking a movie would seem to be somewhat difficult to me, because you have to try to present a story that has already been done before in a similar manner, while giving the audience something new and engaging to witness.  Some directors have been less original with their remakes, opting to merely copy the source movie scene for scene and word for word, merely updating the surroundings a little bit, of course I don't feel these movies do as well, but that's just me.  Now, I never saw the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", so I can't say how much of a copy this version is, but even if this remake is merely a scene for scene recreation of the original, I believe it is one of the rare successes that had been achieved this way. <br /> <br />The success of \\"Poseidon\\" is achieved in part because of the terrific special and practical effects that were employed to make the scenes of the ship being struck by the wave into reality, and for all the disastrous side effects that followed throughout the flipped over ship.  The other part of this movie's success is due to the excellent group of actors that were assembled to fight to survive the sinking cruise ship.  All of the actors did an excellent job with fleshing out these characters over the course of the movie, because there wasn't much time given in the beginning for exposition or development.  I personally felt that the lack of character development prior to the wave striking (which occurs approximately 25 minutes into the movie, providing enough time to basically introduce the characters) was somewhat strange, because you didn't know who to root for, other than by going off whether or not you knew the actor from previous movies and if you liked them or not.  However, once the struggle for survival arc of the movie kicked in, the actors were given more to work with and developed their characters through their interaction with each other allowing them to become more accessible to the audience.   <br /> <br />The decision to focus the movie on the disaster side of the story early on was an odd choice, but one that worked to the film's advantage, by allowing things to get moving quickly and not allow for a lull in the momentum.  Featuring a rather short running time for a disaster movie, at just 98 minutes, a fact that may seem odd for a Wolfgang Peterson film (his movies generally last 2 hours or more), in this instance the shorter running time made for a much tighter feeling movie which served the story well.  \\"Poseidon\\" is a definite must-see among disaster films and one that will keep you on the edge of your seats until the final credits roll. <br /> <br />\\"Poseidon\\" is rated PG-13 for brief language and peril.
B00005JP1A|3.0|I mean horror films are fun to watch in the theater regardless of how it turns out but I still think my friend wasted too much money to have us go out and see this. This was yet another one of those horror movies that literally plague the modern world- one that looks so promising on commercials and yet completely disappoints you when you see the entire thing.    It's not that it was utter garbage. The plot itself keeps your interest but you nonetheless get a bit irritated at how the story unravels. At first this character Swank plays, who is a know- it- all whose job is to go see places of miracles and then find a scientific explantation to them, travels to a small southern town to to check out this supposed river of blood. Suddenly, shocker, they find out it's real blood. By the time the results come back and confirm it is real blood already there have been livestock dying and the children there have a head full of lice among the locusts as well, which were the most interesting scenes in this film- but Swank soon just grows fascinated with the one girl the whole town is blaming this on, supposedly the girl who killed her brother and that was how it started. But of course there is a lot more to it than the town says but I'll leave that little interesting twist for curious readers to find out when they finally see it.     I don't know what exactly ruined this movie. I agree it does sound like a good treat but something really was wrong. Horror films are made by the dozen these days but that doesn't mean horror is easy to succeed in, for a lot of these new films flop because something is seriously lacking as in this one. The best horror films have really an underlying tension that isn't obvious but rather subtle and just scratching at the surface up till the very end. Maybe The Reaping was just trying too hard to be so creepy and so shocking that instead it got sappy and overdrammatic. I think in some parts it was exactly that. I also think Swank is just an overratedactress who can't do well without a strong cast behind her- and she just had an average horror movie cast in the Reaping.     I don't recommend this movie unless you just really are into these type of stories like I am. 3/5
0517548232|4.0|Understanding of basic economics is almost necessary for everyone and this is the one of the best books which explains it in much simpler way. When I started reading this book, I was very curious to know the lesson the author is trying to teach in this book, and it is just not about demand and supply which many other academic economic books trying to teach you. <br /> <br />The author provides good insights into the consequences of the vote-bank policies framed by politicians and bureaucrats in the various governments around the world. The reader can get fair understanding of the effects to the public by the taxation of government, and different policies like trade barriers, minimum wage law, regulatory policies and more importantly effects of inflation and government policies to cause and contain inflation. <br /> <br />Common words like credit, spending, savings, investment are explained adequately to understand their effects on the production and individual. As author himself points out in the last chapter, though not many of these lessons are not followed by politicians around the world even now, this book is must read for them and for public to understand the repercussions of policies introduced by the government and to provide long term solutions to the public welfare.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Tony Scott's \\"Deja Vu\\" surprised me since I had believed I'd seen all of his tricks as a director before. I thought this would be a mind numbingly typical Jerry Bruckheimer big explosion sci-fi thriller ride. While it does fit into that category, it's also surprisingly bright for a Bruckheimber-Scott thriller. I'd always thought of Tony as the less talented brother of Ridley since his films generally don't have a lot of personality but are solid workman-like thrillers. I guess Tony showed me (and all the critics out there as well). You'll note that there are 4 stars above but the system won't allow you to give half stars--this is really a 3 1/2 star film quite clever and enjoyable.<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH PLEASE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLOT.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Denzil Washington plays an ATF agent named Doug Carlin who investigates the bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. When the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton)up on shore that appears to be linked to the bombing he thinks that it's just another case of a body drifting down the Mississippi. What's even more mystifying is that she CALLED him only hours before the explosion and he's never met her before. That is until he realizes the person despite appearences to the contrary was killed and put in the water at least two hours BEFORE the explosion of the ferry. He takes this discovery to an FBI Agent (Val Kilmer)also working the case. The agent asks for Carlin's feedback on surveilance footage of the site and surrounding area from three days before the explosion. What mystifies Carlin is that the video feeds are treated like they are live and they are far too detailed to have come from satellite feeds. A science team working with the FBI has figured out a way to punch a hole through time to see 4 days into the past no more, no less and it must unfold in real time in other words they can't fast forward or rewind what they see unless it has been recorded. Now the team has to gather clues as to the identity of the bomber from this \\"footage\\" from the past. Carlin find himself falling in love with one of the victims who was killed by the terrorist(Jim Caviezel in a creepy extended cameo).<br /><br />***<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />Imagine \\"Time After Time\\" combined with a contemporary thriller and you've got \\"Deja Vu\\" in a nutshell. Now I haven't given away the major plot twists of the movie (the trailer gives away TOO much information I might add)but if you can wrap your mind around \\"Deja Vu\\" you'll enjoy this thought provoking action thriller with as many twists and turns in its maze like storyline as you can imagine. I did find the ending predictable (I figured it out midway through the film but I was thinking about the only possible way the story could resolve itself successfully. That's not to a deficit on the part of the film's script or director that's just how I think. My advice--don't think about the film just watch it and go along with the flow).<br /><br />Tony Scott turns in his usual tour de force of action direction here with nice character development for Washington, Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood (underused in his role I might add--someone give this terrific actor a role he can sink his teeth into again!). \\"Deja Vu\\" is an example of an extremely good mainstream Hollywood thriller. It's not innovative (unlike some of Ridley Scott's films)but it is a fun thrill ride that is definitely worth taking.<br /><br />The DVD features an audio commentary/behind-the-scenes feature with producer Bruckheimer, one of the writers and director Scott discussing the development of the script throughout the film.  The feature will take you into behind-the-scenes stuff just before the scene occurs much like seamless branching that allows you to watch two different versions of a movie or like HD-DVD where you can watch behind-the-scenes stuff while you're watching the movie. You can't do that here unfortunately but it isa pretty cool way to combine a behind-the-scenes featurette with the film itself seamlessly intercutting the two and you really don't have to do anything except turn it on.<br /><br />We also get deleted and extended scenes with comments from director Scott as to why he cut them and most make sense. Sure there was more character development but he also comments--accurately--that these scenes slowed down a time sensitive film like \\"Deja Vu\\". This is the third go round for Scott and Washington and the films they make together have been terrific.cool way to combine a behind-the-scenes featurette with the film itself seamlessly intercutting the two and you really don't have to do anything except turn it on.  <br /> <br />We also get deleted and extended scenes with comments from director Scott as to why he cut them and most make sense.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|This is technically the second review I've ever written (the first was about Madonna). However, Stevie should have been first, since I feel she is the \\"total Package\\" ~ Her output and overall success does not equate to Madonna's, but Stevie is a star, who has written amazing songs. As a live performer, she has no peer. In her hey-day she mesmerized her audience as no other artist could, and I should know I saw her live solo and with Fleetwood Mac no less than 10 times. <br /> <br />Crystal Visions ~ The Very Best of Stevie Nicks is a great CD/DVD. What I like most is the DVD part, offering the video coverage of her in the recording studio with her first solo project, \\"Bella Donna\\". Stevie, unlike Madonna, is an artist who I loved both the person and the artist, and maintained interest in anything she did professionally or privately. She's just that great you can't help but want to know all about her. <br /> <br />There are a couple disappointments, like the absence of \\"Gypsy\\" & \\"Sara\\" (my guess is Fleetwood Mac own the rights and would not let her use them), unless she re-did them as she did with \\"Dreams\\", but too many re-mixes would become dull, and I think Stevie realized this. So she probably had a good excuse (LOL). <br /> <br />The other disappointment is she did not include anything never before released (just live or re-mixed versions of established songs, but nothing totally new for her fans). She made this same mistake on two previous compilations (TimeSpace and Enchanted). All her diehard fans know she has an abundance of material she could have ran into the studio and polished up (such as \\"Belle Fleur\\", one of her greatest \\"unfinished\\" works). <br /> <br />But, still, there are never-before-seen video things on the DVD, and anything from Stevie is something to buy and treasure, so overall I'm still a happy camper! I just wish she'd get her butt back into the studio and release another studio album!
B000MNP2KI|3.0|It's a very good movie, but this disk problem has been a real hassle. You need to contact Sony to request a replacement disk.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|OK, honestly, I've never, ever written a review before, but I was compelled to do so with Confessions On The Dance Floor, and Madonna in general. My later teen years were all about the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Elton John, and the \\"rock legends\\" brewing in the mid-70s. Madonna came a bit later in my early adult years, her early works I found her to be very bubble-gum pop (appealing primarily to 13 year old teenage girls). During her \\"Like A Virgin\\" era I found her cute, with catchy music, and I even bought the album, but I never thought she'd amount to anything beyond the \\"fad of the moment\\". Ha ha, boy was I wrong! <br /> <br />Today I consider Madonna to be among the greatest Legends in rock/or pop. She's right up there with Elvis and the Beatles, and she deserves her place among them. In many ways, her talent surpasses theirs (I probably be shot with that remark, but I truly believe it to be so). <br /> <br />As an artist Madonna has always been totally involved with every aspect of her own career, so the end results give you nearly 100% MADONNA, as opposed to other end results that are 50% artist/50% producer, if you understand my meaning here. Madonna not only wrote the majority of her songs, but she also co-produced them, and was totally involved with the making of each and every one of her songs ~ And with her enormous output during her 25-plus year career, there aren't too many unlikeable songs. <br /> <br />Confessions On A Dance Floor is no exception. It is another Madonna creation that takes us back to Madonna's earlier \\"dance\\" songs. It fits in perfectly with any of her other works. It's a great record. And, unlike most other artists who have aged 20-plus years since their hey-dey, Madonna's voice sounds as lush and beautiful as it ever did ~ She looks just as good, if not better, as well. Madonna definitely has aged well! <br /> <br />Although I was never into Madonna \\"the person\\" so much (as I was with some of the Eagles, and most definitely Stevie Nicks), I was, on the other hand, totally into Madonna's music. She has few peers when it comes to the quality and quantity of her professional output (excepting perhaps Elton John, Paul McCartney or Bob Dylan - But each of these artists had at least 15-20 years head start on her). <br /> <br />Madonna has earned, and most definitely deserves her place as the most successful female artist in history, and I cannot imagine her ever losing that title. <br /> <br />It's nice to see her career is still a work-in-progress. I pray we continue to hear more of Madonna in the coming years. Nothing she has put out yet has been disappointing. She definitely knows how to make great records!
B00000AOUD|5.0|When I first heard a muffled version of this work through an 8-track tape deck in the mid-1970s, I was initially dumbfounded at its raw and delicious cord sense, its uplifting transitions, its oscillating dynamic, its ability to create atmosphere, and its evolving themes--that harken the rondo structures of Mozart's Horn Concerto K.447 third movement or Gershwin's American in Paris, for example.  Being dumbfounded at this work turned into being flabbergasted at the fact that each subsequent listening experience was more fruitful than the previous one.<br /><br />\\"Brick\\" was ground-breaking in its length (taking up both sides of an album), just as Hey Jude, Tommy, and Quadrophenia pushed that same length envelope--in each case, proving that if one produces a high quality product, then one can make it into a longer piece if it maintains quality throughout--the hallmark of a widely accessible and venerable work, worthy of praise and long-lived popularity.  It became a benchmark for me, at that time in the mid-1970s...along with Yes's Close to the Edge, Who's Tommy, Coltrane's My Favorite Things, Beatles' Sgt Pepper, Chopin's Polonaise, Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Bach's Brandenberg Concertos, Joni Mitchell's Court & Spark, Genesis's Selling England by the Pound, Beethoven's 9th, Bruce's Born To Run, Braham's 4th, Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven, Dvorak's 9th Symphony in E minor Opus 95, Steely Dan's Royal Scam, ELP's Trilogy, & Traffic's John Barleycorn Must Die--for having set the absolute industry standard for musical greatness.<br /><br />I learned all of the keyboard parts of the LP in 1979, but my band scoffed at playing it.  Oh well.  To pick a favorite from the litter of Tull albums is quite difficult, but Thick as a Brick is, indeed, my favorite one (apologies to Passion Play, Aqualung, Songs from the Wood, Stormwatch and Stand Up). Thick as a Brick still sounds as fresh and innovative today, circa 2007, as it did in 1973, despite the fact that I have listened to the LP/CD in its entirety several hundred times since.<br /><br />One of the rare perfect musical works, it is even that much better when you consider its inherent concept(s), as well as the fun tongue-in-cheek album cover that accompanies this masterpiece--the cover having taken more time to produce than it took for the band to record the music for the album.  Some day, perhaps, I will stumble upon the opportunity to actually meet Gerald Bostock in person.3, despite the fact that I have listened to the LP/CD in its entirety several hundred times since.   <br /> <br />One of the rare perfect musical works, it is even that much better when you consider its inherent concept(s), as well as the fun tongue-in-cheek album cover that accompanies this masterpiece--the cover having taken more time to produce than it took for the band to record the music for the album.

B0000C8AVI|5.0|\\"Shine your light, Shine your light on me\\"<br /><br />On November 17, 1978, Bob Dylan picked up a silver cross that was tossed on stage by a fan at a concert in San Diego, California, that was nearly marking the end of a year-long tour. He then had a vision of Christ while in a Tuscon, Arizona, hotel room, and - at the final tour date in Miami, Florida - debuted a new song, Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others), which began the merging of Dylan's new personal faith as a born-again Christian with his music to produce his greatest studio effort ever.<br /><br />Released in August 1979, Dylan's trek into Christian teachings and philosophy are heard in the nine songs, that clock in at about 47 minutes, with the album reaching number three on the U.S. and number two on the U.K. album charts.<br /><br />\\"I just can't make it by myself\\"<br /><br />Though most of the instrumental focus is rightfully on the Muscle Shoals Horns and Mark Knopfler (g) & Pick Withers (d) of Dire Straits, the powerful background vocals of Carolyn Dennis, Helena Springs and Regina Havis place exclamation points on the powerful gospel numbers.<br /><br />Gotta Serve Somebody does not skirt the stark consequences when a person willfully elects to pursue the avenues of evil. Precious Angel has an utterly beautiful melody and you will not hear as powerful a sermon from any pulpit as found in Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking. The guitar solos by Knopfler on Slow Train compliments the classic Dylan lyrics and America 2007 is found in When You Gonna Wake Up, as provocative a protest song - written for 1970s America - ever penned by Dylan.<br /><br />\\"I'm a little too blind to see\\"<br /><br />But the song, I Believe in You, which concerns being cast out due to unpopular religious beliefs, seemingly set the stage for a six-month tour - starting on November 1, 1979 - to promote the album. Dylan would not play older compositions - radio ads and other media material informed fans of the tour structure - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs.<br /><br />But what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan's powerful messages of protest/patriotism, fellowship, friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life. That he wanted to share his faith with others made his personal mission to spread the gospel even more wondrous.ture - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs.    <br /> <br />But what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan's powerful messages of protest/patriotism, fellowship, friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|This is an extremely well produced concert DVD both visually and sound-wise.  The band is in very good form though it would be unfair to expect them to be at their highest peak.  They are very well-coordinated musically on the tunes but they have all lost the slightest bit of edge on their playing and singing - not that you would notice it unless you have each note of all of their tunes committed to memory. <br /> <br />Still they are head an shoulders above most of the rest and the DVD is a joy and a must have for fans of the band and younger rock aficionados as well.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Alfred Borden (Bale) and Rufus Angier (Jackman) are friends striving to learn magic -- until a stage trick goes wrong and Angier begins to wreak vengence on Borden. Once Borden gets hurt, he begins to attack Angier. Life continues as they battle to become the best magician while doing their best to destroy their opponent. The movie builds tension steadily until Angier becomes obsessed with finding out the secret to Borden's Transporting Man -- which leads him to Tesla and an invention which should top Borden's trick -- but at a soul rending price.    Along the way, these men are so single-mindedly focused on destroying each other that they destroy their own chances for happiness and love. Their desire to pull off the most memorable trick and to destroy the other is all they have in their lives.    Never the less, the film is a wonderful blend of character study and the world of magic and magicians.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This film has a lot of filler that needs to hit the cutting room floor.  The tale unfolds initially disjointed, but the pieces do fall in place after a long,long time.  This is a good story about a very cold, stoic man who has a love for his country, but constrains himself so much that he looses sight of his family and personal life. There is a lot of crossing and double crossing, which is complicated, but drug out longer than it needs.  Overall, worth a viewing, and a nice change of pace for Angelina Jolee and Matt Damon, but not worth buying.

B000MV9026|3.0|We all complain when a movie is formulaic and takes no risks, such as Shark Tale.  So when a movie like Happy Feet comes along, we must award props for originality and newness.<br /><br />Happy Feet is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood) who loves to tap dance.  He does not have the innate ability of his brother penguins, who use a heartsong to attract a mate.  Ostracized except for his friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), he strays and becomes lost in a foreign penguin colony.  These penguins love to dance and he becomes the leader of five spunky Chicano penguins (Ramon voiced by Robin Williams, who also voices the Macaroni penguin).  His return to his home colony is less than triumphant, and he leaves again for good, on a quest to find out the source of the missing fish.<br /><br />The music soundtrack is delightful.  I love Nicole Kidman as Mumble's mother, Norma Jean.  She is a sexy singer.  The way she meets her husband Memphis (Hugh Jackman), is true love.<br /><br />Now we come to the environmental message.  It is all true that fish stocks are severely depleted and that the ocean environment is suffering.  The controversy is, does such a strong message belong in a children's movie?  That is up to the viewer to decide, but for me, it was a little heavy after all the precious, cuddly gray baby Emperor penguins and lighthearted music.  The way Mumble goes out on his quest is ultra-serious.  His eyes at one point look just like Frodo on his journey to get The Ring of Sauron.<br /><br />The movie even takes digs at religion, which is not cool.  So children will love this movie, but their parents may be disturbed by the underlying social-political messages.
B000O178BY|5.0|I got to admit: it genuinely takes me quite a while to like a Nine Inch Nails record through and through. Problem is some of the songs either don't have enough hooks or they're just kind of...boring. After awhile the record clicks but I was surprised by how many listens Year Zero took before I \\"got\\" it. The concept for the album also is unbelievably fascinating that it almost overshadows the record itself.     Set in 2022, the world has been reduced to a dystopian hellzone with the government running amok with drugs, chemically altered water and strange appearances of a 4-fingered hand from the sky called the \\"Presence\\" (on the album cover). Inspired by the current government state, the world presented is easier to see when you read the Year Zero timeline or watch the trailers such as a frantic phone call, a distressing look into a sniper's world and a creepy video showing the Presence. The only thing that's hard to discern is where the story kicks in and when it's just Trent being Trent. Known for being a little lyrically dark, the album's lyrics sound like typical NIN so you kind of have to make up your own story as the tracks progress.    The album gets started off with Hyperpower!, a loud and huge sounding opener, it's led by a catchy drum beat before it gets progressively busy and noisy. The Beginning of the End is another album highlight with a heavy beat and a catchy melody. A lot of NIN songs tend to be really heavy without having much to remember it but this, along with first single Survivalism, which for some reason, I never liked. Even after several listens I just wasn't a big fan of it. But then again, it's gotten a bigger response from fans so maybe it's just me. What helps the album though is there's plenty to like from early fan favorite Capital G and God Given to the effective closer Zero Sum. But be warned, many of these songs probably won't hook you immediately since the album doesn't really have a readymade hit like Closer, Wish or Hurt. Not thatthe album needs it but tracks sometimes bleed into each other and it's hard to pick out favorites when others sound so similar to it. Paying attention to each track will help not only the flow of the album but also experience the songs as a whole rather than \\"that one song I like I couldn't remember the name of\\".    Is there anything that kind of mires the album, making it something less than it should be? In a way. With NIN records, you're always going to have tracks that have more to do with creating a certain emotion or feel rather than going for the radio hit approach. As such, like I said, songs sometimes bleed into another or the song is just \\"is\\": no real identifiable hooks or melodies and while people would defend each song Trent makes, some songs just don't flow when you listen outside of the record. For example, the catchy God Given is sandwiched between the \\"ok\\" tracks The Warning and Meet Your Master. This makes certain tracks stand out more and allows them to have a much more meaningful listen.    One thing you have to give props to Trent is quite gifted at providing a sonic landscape. Whereas a lot of bands, stick to the conventional guitar/bass/drums approach, Trent basically goes nuts using so much at his disposal that, even though individual tracks might not grab you; on an aural level, there's so much going on that it tends to demand immediate attention to make sense of what's going on. Songs such as The Greater Good are quite intricate in their arrangements that this becomes kind of a headphone record.     Is it as immediate as the Downward Spiral was? Very much so but give the record enough time to sink in which tends to come much more faster than the Fragile was.

B000O178BY|4.0|<br />I was completely disgusted with the prior album \\"with teeth.\\"  I thought it was lacking creativity and any form of intensity that NIN has always brought for me. <br /> <br />Now, I'm proud to say that this is absolutely my favorite album from Reznor...ever!  Every song has bite to it.  For example, just when you think a song climaxed, a screeching futuristic guitar solo from hell chops everything up, there were times when I would just skip back over that part just to hear it again.  Many other bands will soon follow little bits of evolution that are placed throughout this album. <br /> <br />Thus, if you're looking for something FRESH out there, and 1,000 times better than \\"with teeth,\\" pick this one up.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Directed by the incomparable Billy Wilder, this is iconic Gloria Swanson in the comeback-of-all-comeback films (even though as Norma Desmond she protests that she hates that word, it's \\"Return!\\").  From the crumbling Spanish Revival (J. P. Getty-owned) mansion to the leopard-upholstered Isotta-Fraschini (once owned by Peggy Hopkins Joyce, the inspiration for Lorelei Lee in \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blonds\\"),  this is a tour-de-force of behind-the-scenes Hollywood atmosphere, the dark flipside of the other great send up of when Talkies came to Tinsletown, \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\"<br /><br />But first of all, dismiss the myth that this movie was a biopic of Gloria's life.  Not in the least.  True, Gloria had been a huge success in silents (at age 25, the first actress with a million dollar contract) but she made the transition to sound just fine, even singing in early 1930s films like \\"The Trespasser\\" (\\"Love Your Magic Spell is Everywhere\\") and \\"Music in the Air\\" (which Billy Wilder also worked on).  If anything, it was her exotic look, not her voice, that made her seem pass&eacute; in the darkening days of the Depression.<br /><br />To create Miss Desmond, screenwriters Charles Brackett (who also scripted \\"Ninotchka\\"), D. M. Marshman Jr. and Billy Wilder threw in all of the faded film star lore they could, combining the May-December marriage and mostly pickled later life of America's Sweetheart Mary Pickford (who was offered and turned down the part) and the quick fadeout to black of the other Norma (Talmadge).  Throw in the other two Talmadge sisters, Clara Bow, Mable Normand, et al; the stories you hear are true, but a compilation and the names have been changed, sort of.<br /><br />Then, once she agreed to the starring role, as an additional benefit, Gloria graciously allowed all of her personal mementos, from the unreleased and von Strohiem directed \\"Queen Kelly\\" to the plethora of 8 x 10 genuine publicity stills, to give the set verisimilitude.  Her Chaplin-taught imitation of himself, her collaboration with De Mille (right down to his pet name for her \\"Young Fella\\"), the quip about Valentino and the tile floor, and more, were bonuses that make the film more than just another pastiche of a long-gone era.<br /><br />Swanson and Holden do yeoman's work as the ill-fated couple in a nightmarish liaison that can only end badly.  The lush Franz Waxman score augments a script replete with quotable quotes about the perils of a star's decline. There are layers and layers of Hollywood goodies, like the storyline that Holden and Nancy Olson spoof about, concerning a guy and a gal who rent the same flat, one sleeping in the daytime and the other at night, sharing the apartment on a shift basis, never seeing each other; it is a real 1933 film, called \\"Rafter Romance\\" starring Ginger Rogers and Laura Hope Crewes.<br /><br />The staircase finale has become a thing of legend--deftly spoofed by Carol Burnett.  Gloria enjoyed Carol's sketch so much, she made a guest appearance on the Carol Burnett Show, as a result. Even so, the film's ending line is surely one of the five greatest in all Hollywood history, the others being, \\"Casablanca\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Some Like It Hot\\" and \\"Now, Voyager\\".ration with De Mille (right down to his pet name for her \\"Young Fella\\"), the quip about Valentino and the tile floor, and more, were bonuses that make the film more than just another pastiche of a long-gone era.

B000KWZ7VU|5.0|Here is a set that is, and will be for future generations, priceless. If it cost twice as much it would still be worth it, and a great deal.    The complete traversal (in recital) of the Beethoven 32 has been done a number of times since Sir Charles Hallé first accomplished the mammoth task in 1861, but never before has it been caught on film.    Maestro Barenboim is completely up to the task. Having played many of the Sonatas for more than fifty years one is not surprised at his great insights and seriousness, but almost shockingly (when one thinks of how much time he spends with his \\"non-pianistic\\" activities) he is also still up to all the considerable technical and endurance demands.    The recitals are filled to the brim with moments of insight, beauty, profundity, joy, power and greatness that are too numerous to mention. Even the occasional interpretive choice that I find puzzling (the decidedly not \\"Allegro molto e vivace\\" from Sonata no.13 jumps to mind) does nothing to diminish any of the concerts, no one will ever be able to play all 32 in a way that pleases everyone, it would be folly to even attempt to do so. Instead Barenboim does exactly what he should (unsurprisingly); he plays with great knowledge and understanding, leaving nothing to chance. It would be impossible for me to recommend this any more highly to anyone interested in the Piano, Beethoven or Music.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This was a good movie, with a great twist at the END!!! This is definitely one to watch over and over again. I never was a DiCaprio fan, but this role is one of the reasons I now enjoy his work. Jack Nicholson is classic in here, a no nonsense type of wise guy! Matt Damon Plays a character that you would love if you didn't hate him so much! Add this to your collection if you already own classics such as Resevoir Dogs, Lucky Number Slevin, Donnie Brasco, etc...
B000NA28I4|1.0|I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits.
B00005JO1R|3.0|It was lengthy but amusing at times.<br /><br />I guess one must be in the right mood for this type of movie.<br />Character portrayal was just alright.<br /><br />I was a fan of Johnny Cash and a little disappointed.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have seen many amazing things in my life including some awesome documentaries but before now would have never used the word \\"breathtaking\\" to describe it. This entire series of 11 episodes will show you things that you have never seen before or in some cases even imagined that they existed. Some of the things shown here have never been filmed before and may never again.<br /><br />There is footage of endangered wildlife so rare and near extinction in this series that they might quite possibly be extinct before they could be filmed again. You will see life in all stages of its existence from feast to famine, You will see wildlife in numbers you never imagined existed. You will see breathtaking landscapes and scenery from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans.<br /><br />The entire series was shot in High Definition Video. You do not need to have a High Definition TV to see the amazing difference in detail and quality. They have numerous time lapse scenes that are one of a kind.<br /><br />I could write paragraphs about this series but the bottom line is you must watch it, and if you have watched it you will want to own it. This is one of a kind footage you will not see anywhere else. 10 Star Rating!!!
B000002KDS|5.0|Studio album released in 1971, by the original band-a real band with Alice Cooper, Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, Michael Bruce, and Glen Buxton. I think the other band members (apart from Cooper), got the short end of the stick. This album, along with these 'Love it to death', 'Billion dollar babies', and 'Love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums. The band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band. Case in point, listen to 'Dada' from a few years later-dreadful! Just wish he had kept a proper band together, even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians. Rock is about feel, more than technique in my opinion. I can't even listen to 'Dada' or
B000MR9D5E|5.0|When I first seen the preview of Planet Earth coming to Discovery Channel in Mid March 2007, I thought it would almost be the same type of documentary like all other programming like Blue Seas, etc. But I was wrong, I've seen most of the series, and it literally takes your breath away. Every second of the program is so amazing, that its so astonishing and so beautiful to see what God has created here on earth. Every single detail of a creature or living plant, reminds me of God, it is God Who is the All Mighty, the most Merciful, the most Peaceful, the most Powerful, the most Gracious, and the most Beautiful over all the universe. Planet Earth was such a great beautiful program to watch, it really shows us (humans) that we are not roaming this planet a lone, that there are millions of other species living amongst us. The film crew did a magnificent job filming this documentary in 5 years. I've never ever in my life seen images and beauty of Planet Earth before. Planet Earth literally blows your mind away, its so realistic, that you just feel like crying and getting so emotional, because its so beautiful to see these beautiful creatures that we've never seen before live so graciously amongst us. It is God's beautiful creatures. I loved this program so much, that I had ordered it on April 8, 2007. Its seriously worth it to buy the entire series for like $60.00, because they are never going to film something like this again, probably not in our lifetime, maybe in the next generation. Purchase this series, and enjoy the show, its a mind bottling experience, it touches the most sensitive part of your heart and soul. It will leave a permanent visual reminder of what else lives and thrives in this beautiful planet called Earth.
B000002KBA|5.0|This album slays anything the band did before or after. They have been around for decades, but this is their only nasterpiece, in my opinion. Maybe 'Machine head' came a close second. 'Deep Purple in rock' is a landmark album. Worth the price of admission for 'Speed King' and 'Child in time' alone--stunning!!! Buy it for these 2 tracks.

B00006DEF9|5.0|This is known as the greatest musical ever made, and if it isn't the greatest, it's certainly one of the top five.  I love this movie.  The dance numbers are amazingly filmed and choreographed, and it's nice to see Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly actually leave their camera linger and not constantly cut away (via MTV style), so we can see everyone dance (and, man, can they dance).  The film has a very sly, sarcastic humour (especially Gene Kelly's \\"dignity\\" speech at the beginning), but the humour is never overly nasty, like much humour is today.  The film is actually quite realistic in its depiction of Hollywood's transition to sound (which was chaotic in many respects), and it has probably the most positive portrayal of a studio head in film history.  The final Broadway ballet sequence is a movie in itself.  It goes on for 15 minutes or so, and feels like an art film contained in a Hollywood musical.  The only other musical sequence that comes close is the final sequence in An American in Paris.  The ballet sequences in Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes is like it too.  All the performances are really good, especially Donald O'Connor as Kelly's sidekick.  His Make 'Em Laugh song shows off his amazing dancing abilities.  This film is as great as you've heard, and I really love the Hollywood musical era.  Sure as heck beats the musical MTV era by miles....

0062502182|4.0|For me The Alchemist represented a quest for meaning; about interpreting what we think we know and constantly trying to make sense of it. It's a seemingly simple story but delves into questions and possibilities that we may not be able to understand with our earthly minds.  <br /> <br />It's about a young man, Santiago, who, prompted by his dreams, makes a journey to find a treasure he feels will be very important to him. Will his finding be material or otherwise? What is material anyway? Is what he experiences on his journey his treasure? These are the types of things that he will come to ponder and explore with others who appear along his trek. <br /> <br />I was touched in many ways by this story, but one particular part especially stayed with me: to see how, as a shepherd, Santiago took such care and concern for his sheep and felt that he learned from them and was an integral part of the process of the universe in doing so - made me feel his empathy and relish his ability to understand things intuitively. There are many lessons in just this part of the story for me.  <br /> <br />The Alchemist gives you pause; a way to reflect on what you may have considered important in your life. I know it will stay with me, and even now I sense the urge to at some point pick it up again and take a second journey with Santiago. Until then, I feel I'll be looking at things with the story as a part of me, perhaps making my quest more meaningful. <br />
B000JJRIN4|1.0|The whole album sounds the same...no even close to the last album. It does have a good baseline throughout so if you like that sound, you might like the album.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|The Lake House starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is one of the most sensual movies of 2006. This movie still confuses me a bit but the writing, acting, and plot is top-notch in every way.  The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock is explosive, you truly believe they are in love, too bad they never fell for each other behind the scenes. The premise of the film is Kate (Bullock) lives in the year 2006 and Alex (Reeves) lives in the year 2004 and they develop a deep and powerful relationship but they are living two years apart so how can they be destine to be together, well you just have to see this one to find out. And keep your ears open to the beautiful ballad Kate and Alex slowdance to, This Never Happened Before by Sir Paul McCartney, it's magical. Enjoy!
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I read the reviews and got the HD DVD and was not disappointed at all!! Even though this is not John Wayne's best performance, the scenery is really worth seeing in HD.  Watched the whole thing that afternoon when it came in the mail.  I didn't intend to, but was taken by how good it looked especially considering how old the film was.  One word... WOW!  When this High Definition dust settles, we're in for some eye popping films at home.  If you like westerns, give this one some consideration.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This movie is a classic. I put off buying the dvd and stuck with my vhs copy till a special edition was released. I was very glad when I found out about this upcoming special edition dvd. I plan on getting this and That Thing You Do when they come out the same day. Tom Hanks is a genius.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|I recently read an article in Rolling Stone about how great a guitar player John Mayer is. In the magazine he was placed side by side with John Frusciante and Derek Trucks. Being a guitar fan I decided to give him a shot and bought this album.  <br />I just could not get through all the songs. Man is this boring.  <br />Maybe he is a good guitar player but the overly (and I mean OVERLY) mellow tunes just obscured everything else. I won't mention the fact that Rolling Stone made references to Stevie Ray Vaughn, John Mayer is nowhere in SRV's scale. I guess I'll just stick to the original. <br /> <br />Sorry John, maybe next time.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Hello everyone,<br /><br />Avril's first cd was great , it included a lot of acoustic and rock with some awesome choruses! Her second cd is great also including some good guitar and a lot of ballads mostly. This cd is really a radical change i feel, but in the right direction! When you listen to the songs you can feel that its just about having fun , being wierd and unique. The sound is punk/pop/rock which for me i love. The dvd is well done , she comments on a lot of the songs and shows you her creative process. The most important thing about this album is that Avril loves it , she loved making it and it really shows that she thought of her fans. Some people wont agree with me but i wish she would swear more and show more angry emotion on some songs, maybe in the future ! Go avril !!!!!!!!
B000J10ERO|3.0|Brandon Roush and Kevin Spacey lead a very able cast in a less than able movie. The script/plot was horrible and unbelievable. You don't really get to see astronomers FINDING Krypton... and how can they find what isn't there? The world was destroyed.<br /><br />Having Superman leave should have been motivated by something more believable. Maybe some other Kryptonians survived and were thriving in another distant civilization or whatever.<br /><br />The point being that this plot failed from its very inception. Frank Langella made a great \\"Daily Planet\\" Editor and the rest of the cast were very well played. But the movie didn't give you any information about the Christopher Reeve series. My son kept asking me questions that would have been answered had he seen the Christopher Reeve movies first. If you're going to make a movie for a new generation, to try and revive a love for Superman, it's best to return to his roots.<br /><br />You can always send him on a different mission later, but when introducing Superman to a generation that wasn't alive in the 1970's and 80's you need to give them background on how he became Superman to begin with.
B000H305U0|1.0|Come on people, lets get real here! I understand how people want to listen to fun party dance music, but don't you realize you can do that and still listen to something with substance. <br />Justin Timberlake tries real hard to shake his boyband image. He obviously is dying to be looked at as credible. Don't get me wrong, he does have some talent, but it really only has to do with his dance moves, a falsetto voice, and yeah maybe he knows how to play a few chords. <br />I heard this cd because someone else was playing it and I couldn't leave, so I was stuck listening to it. When something like that happens, I try real hard to listen with an open mind. <br />It's more of the same stuff he's always been doing. His producer Timbaland supplies the beats and sounds. In this cd, they fail miserably at using sounds that were created and invented by Prince. <br />In a way it's nice of JT to pay homage to the most amazing talent of our time, but you're not Prince JT...so be original! <br />The sound is there, but the way they use the Prince sound is again flat, unexciting, boring, and undynamic. <br />Instead of hiring Timbaland, he should of hired Prince. Prince has written songs and produced music for 100s of other artists mostly under the disguise of another name.
B000NA28IE|2.0|In order to tell the tale, a movie in the range of three hours would have been required. Instead, you are given about half of that (102 minutes). Instead of a solid bridge from start to finish, you are given stepping stones, some of which are covered in moss. <br />To make matters worse, the actors seem over-rehearsed and uninspired. In some cases, the actors may have been miscast. <br />The bottom line is this: READ THE BOOK. If you want to experience this story, there is no shortcut, you must read the book. I am confident you will find the written story a fine one indeed; worthy of reading.
B000CCD0HQ|4.0|This is where Top buckled down, got their sound straightened out, and focused on delivering one killer blues-rocker after another. Yeah, they had done so before with Rio Grande Mud (another good one), but this was a tighter, better album. Which is why it produced the group's breakthrough hit, the dirty-voiceover-meets-Hip Shake-riff-meets-stellar-guitar-solo La Grange. It didn't break the Top 40, but it came close enough and is today justly a classic rock radio staple. Speaking of which, I assume you've also heard cuts like Waiting for the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago and Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers. Both songs are essential ZZ. Scorching, brilliantly simple blues-rock. Actually, that's what the whole album's like, so if you like those you shouldn't forget about Master of Sparks, Move Me on Down the Line or Precious and Grace. Those seven are good enough to make this ZZ's best album ever. But it's second to Deguello because some of it isn't very impressive - Hot Blue and Righteous could be my least favorite classic-era ZZ Top song, I don't know. But I'm not a fan of it. Ballads never were Top's strong suit in the first place. I'm not exactly blown away by Shiek or Have You Heard Either. But this should belong to anyone who appreciates the little ol' blues band from Texas.
B00005MP58|4.0|We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that are based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life, horse riding and letter writing among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.    And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before the romantic tensions can be resolved and they can snuggle down in Mr. Darcy's little mansion. On a personal level this is about overweening pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, unseemly and irrationally snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) Austen's looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.
B00005ASGG|5.0|John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart come together to lead one of the most dynamic casts of characters ever put into a western movie.<br /><br />Who really shot Liberty Valance?<br /><br />In a story that speaks to true inner strength and humility, the question is answered after the strangest turn of circumstances sees Jimmy Stewart (Ransom Stoddard) rise from humble (almost cowardly) beginnings to become a very well-respected man of the community. It's only later in life that he learns he's made his name on the actions of John Wayne's character...<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but one thing you learn in this movie is that things are not what they first seem. And that makes the movie WAY ahead of its time!<br /><br />I am stoked to see it available on DVD.
B000O178BY|5.0|I haven't really been a big NIN fan, I don't own any of their CD's, and I usually don't listen to \\"industrial\\" music. There were a couple of songs by them that I did enjoy, but not enough to justify a purchase. Then I heard the first single from Year Zero, entitled \\"Survivalism.\\" I couldn't get enough of it. Then I heard \\"Meet Your Master\\" and decided I needed this CD. I checked the NIN website and found that that had a full CD preview uploaded, so I took a listen through, and loved it. I hit Circuit City yesterday and picked up a copy for $10, and I have listened to it at least 4 or 5 times by now. Pick this one up, it's worth it.
1843532727|4.0|This was a good book for my trip to Japan.  It provided excellent commentary on history and sites, which I read before visiting temples and shrines.  I stayed at two of the accomodation selections in Kyoto and found them to be right on target with the write up.  It also is helpful for traveling within the country as it has accurate prices and routes. The maps were a good overview of the area, though they could be better organized with the text.  I can't give it 5 stars because of the map organization and because I only used it for three places in Japan. A good resource!
B000O178BY|5.0|I've never written a review for Amazon, but after hearing \\"Year Zero\\" I felt compelled to do so.  I've listened to hundreds of rock albums from all eras, the 60's to the present day, but \\"Year Zero\\" has become my all-time favorite after just a few listens.  I really thought that \\"The Fragile\\" would ultimately be Trent Reznor's magnum opus, but to me \\"Year Zero\\" is even better.  It is a masterpiece of inventiveness. In fact, I believe that it qualifies as art of a very high order.  Not to detract from Trent Reznor's enormous talent, but this is the sort of art, like all great art, that seems almost to have been channeled from God, or whatever you want to call that \\"something\\"  that's bigger than life itself. Having heard it a few times, you get the sense that this music was inevitable.  Whether it was Trent Reznor or someone else, it HAD to be created.  It seems to resonate with something inside, as if you had heard it before in a dream or some previous life. <br /> <br />\\"Year Zero\\" is a sonic experience. It plays out like an electronica symphony, and should thus be listened to as a whole.  If someone decides to make a Year Zero movie, the soundtrack has already been done.  Just when you think the album couldn't get better or more interesting, it does, right down to the last track.  In contrast to previous Nine Inch Nails albums, such as \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" that dealt with personal angst, \\"Year Zero\\" tackles a much broader theme. It tells the story of an Orwellian future society in which peoples' thoughts and actions are controlled by the government (or something).  A tale of impending doom is told, moving inexorably to the \\"end of days\\" on the last three, poignant tracks.  I imagine a lot of intellectuals would say that the Year Zero story  isn't original and that Reznor's lyrics are sophomoric.  But that would miss the point. Reznor's genius is that he tells the story with sound.  The music itself evokes the emotions one would feel about a world in which we lose our humanity. To me, the story is much more powerful when told in those terms, with apologies to \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984.\\" <br /> <br />The album works on many levels. It challenges one to ask whether the current administration's policies, the war in Iraq, prisoner torture and ignoring rights to privacy, are the first steps toward a Year Zero society.  But it does so while it delivers an exhilirating and unique musical experience.  At turns, \\"Year Zero\\" is hip, sexy, danceable, poignant and beautiful.  This album is more electronica-based than any of Nine Inch Nails' previous albums.  Of course, all their albums have had plenty of electronica, but the style here is quite different.  There are lots of Autechre-like blips and bleeps, but unlike the sterile, mathematical style of Autechre, Reznor's use of that medium is more moving and melodic. No one pieces together static and distortion like Trent Reznor.  The song \\"Vessel\\" is astonishing.  It's the first track where the subject of mind control is presented.  The person singing has been infused from within by some force, and there is an obvious suggestion that the experience feels sexual.  Amazingly, the song itself is so effecting that it lets the LISTENER experience the force.  <br /> <br />A compelling aspect of Reznor's music-making is the way he blends traditional instruments with electronica.  This was the genius of \\"The Fragile,\\" and is still on display, albeit to a lesser extent, on \\"Year Zero.\\"  \\"The Warning\\" has a wicked guitar riff that Jimi Hendrix would have been proud of.  The last few tracks of the album have moving piano interludes on top of ambient electronica, and the eerie \\"Another Version of the Truth\\" uses calypso-style steel drums and a harp to great effect.  <br /> <br />Maybe the thing I appreciate most, though, about this album is that it  <br />ends up feeling hopeful.  Given the subject matter, the musical story could have been rendered even more bleakly than \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was.  On the last track, when Reznor liltingly sings \\"Shame on us. Doomed from the start.  May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts,\\" it's almost as if he's saying \\"Hey, there's still hope!  It doesn't have to end up like it does in Year Zero.\\"  Let's hope it doesn't, or at least that it doesn't until after Trent Reznor makes another album. <br />
1564029654|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter when she was less than 2 years old.  We read it every night for years.   <br /> <br />It is such a delightful book about three young owls, Sarah, Percy and Bill who wake in the night to find their mommy GONE!.  As they wait for her to return, they sat and they though (all owls think alot) about what could happen to her.  All of a sudden, she swooped through the trees to the three owl babies.  Sarah, Percy and Bill were so excited.  Their owl mommy tells them, \\"you knew I'd come back\\".       <br /> <br />I love to give this wonderful book as gifts.  It was so well written by Martin Waddell and the illustrations by Patrick Benson are beautiful.  This is a keeper!

0930289234|5.0|The 1980s were a revolutionary time for the comic book industry.  What began as a way to offer cheap entertainment to kids suddenly became a storytelling medium worth taking seriously, thanks in no small part to the two greatest writers to emerge from that time period: Frank Miller and Alan Moore.  Miller and Moore, now recognized as arguably the greatest comic book writers who ever lived, revitalized a dying form of entertainment and turned it into what it is today: art.  Miller's seminal work is \\"[[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]],\\" released in 1986, the tale of an aging Bruce Wayne and his decision to fight one last battle against crime.  Upon its release it was hailed as a landmark in the medium, and the greatest comic ever written.  At the time, it was.<br /><br />However, that same year, Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen\\" was released upon the world.  Immediately it was hailed as the NEW greatest comic ever written, a milestone, and an immense achievement.  (Moore would go on to write numerous similarly acclaimed works, in particular \\"[[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]].\\")  The praise was not undeserved, and time has only increased the amount of praise for Moore's masterpiece.  Though \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" seemed astoundingly deep upon its release, \\"Watchmen\\" is a far more intricate work.  Moore infuses \\"Watchmen\\" with a sort of undeniably true and painfully pessimistic social commentary, and handles it just as deftly (though not with such flash) as would George Orwell.  (The book often echoes Orwell's \\"[[ASIN:0451524934 1984]].\\")  He also juggles the main storyline with a pulp comic book read by a kid within the story, and at the same time ends each chapter with essays and clippings and such from newspapers, magazines, police reports, etc., adding even more depth to an already very deep work.<br /><br />The storyline is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant, if not THE most brilliant, in comic book history.  \\"Watchmen\\" is set in 1985, in a chaotic world only subtly different from our own.  Richard Nixon is still president, and the United States won the Vietnam War.  The biggest difference is that superheroes are real.  Inspired by the classic comic superheroes which emerged from the Great Depression, a select bunch of people began dressing up in costumes and fighting crime from the 1940s until the 1960s.  A law passed in the 70s, however, forbids superheroes and forced most to unmask.  A select few did not.  One of those who refused to quit is Rorschach, a violent, antisocial antihero.  When one of his fellow superheroes, \\"the Comedian,\\" is found murdered, Rorschach takes to the streets to investigate.  His investigation will eventually cause ex-superheroes to reevaluate their retirement, the public to rise up in anger against their \\"protectors,\\" and the world to be changed forever.  The plot, the scale, and the tension of the book thickens immensely with each passing chapter, until concluding with a horrific and mind-shattering conclusion.<br /><br />First off, to call \\"Watchmen\\" the greatest comic book ever made is an understatement, and unfortunately, even that statement wouldn't give the book the attention it deserves.  It would be far more fitting to call it one of the finest works of popular fiction ever published, period.  \\"Watchmen\\" is a work of incredible talent, depth, artistry, and meaning, a timeless masterpiece that is at once a throwback to the comics of old and a statement on the nature of humanity and the dreadful truths about society.  It's also the most mature and adult comic I've ever read.  It's likely that the audiences reading Siegel & Shuster's \\"Superman\\" comics or Bob Kane's \\"Batman\\" comics in the 1930s and 40s couldn't begin to comprehend \\"Watchmen.\\"  To modern audiences, it's as pertinent a work as ever there was.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" really doesn't feel so much like a comic as it does a book (partially because it's about three times the size of a normal comic), only with illustrations (by Dave Gibbons).  Gibbons' illustrations are magnificent.  Compared to the artwork of other modern comics like Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1593963149 Sin City series]], the artwork of \\"Watchmen\\" feels very much like Golden Era artwork.  The colors are particularly vibrant, even if the color scheme revolves mostly around the more rusty colors.  The drawings themselves are excellent, their charmingly old-fashioned style perfectly offsetting Moore's very contemporary and modern writing.  However, this is an offset that works remarkably well, once again proving the old saying \\"opposites attract.\\"<br /><br />One just can't conceive the brilliance of \\"Watchmen\\" without having read it.  It is unquestionably the finest comic book/graphic novel ever written, and I have no doubt that it will remain so forever.  It's unsurpassable.  The comic book industry remains criminally underappreciated, but if there was ever a work that proves this is a medium to be taken seriously, it's \\"Watchmen.\\"  If you have read comics before, there is no excuse for not having read the book, and if you haven't - well, I simply can't recommend it enough.  Zach Snyder's film adaptation will bring the book into the spotlight again, and that's wonderful, but \\"Watchmen\\" was designed to work solely as a comic, and that is how it should be experienced.  It's a passionate book clearly made by persons who love the medium, and it should be ranked amongst the finest fiction works ever written.
B000O178BY|5.0|I won't bore you with all the info., you probably know. If you're looking at the reviews ,you obviously have the album or contemplating on buying it.First of all,Reznor coninues to amaze and thrill with his muisc. A pure genius!!!!In some ways,this album has the hints of \\"Broken\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\".Many new sounds too. Bottom line is,get it,if you don't already at any source you can. Standout tracks are,\\"The Beginning Is The End\\",\\"Survivalism\\",\\"The Good Soldier\\",\\"Capital G\\",\\"Meet Your Master\\" and \\"The Great Destroyer\\". As we get into this one,Trent is already working on the next one,which he hopes to get out next year. Buy it,you will be Rocked out!!!!!
1559408855|5.0|I don't want to discuss about the movie. but the quality of the DVD was awfull. sound and picture both. picture quality was like that screener bootleg movies. criterion group unfortunately didn't do any restoration in this matter! and there is no special featues either. only movie perhaps direct from the original negavie and an english subtitle. that's all!
B00004RF98|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, and a musical even for those who don't like musicals.  You must watch this feel-good movie at least once in your life.  Ostensibly, the plot is about the transition a film company and some actors must make from silent film to sound movies.  But the real attraction is the many amazing dance and music sequences, especially Donald O'Connor's \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" routine.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Before buying this DVD, I had seen approximately 1.5 episodes a year ago.  This show made such an impression on me that when it came up as a reccomendation, I snached it up.  When the DVD's arrived, I watched the entire season in a couple days.  The show is very unique, having only two lead rolls and few reoccruing characters.  But the characters are so well developed and deep, that they still keep you entertained.  The leads, Sam and Dean Winchester, are polar opposites, but I felt I could relate to both of them, making me watch one episode after another.  The WB has always been know for their Sci-Fi shows, and Supernatural is one of the best ones yet.  The dynamic relationship the brothers have with their father (Which all guys can relate to) is brilliantly juxtaposed againts the shows horror-paranormal plot along with often comic relief.  Overall this has become one of my favorite shows on TV nowadays.  If you like horror or sci-fi, this show is a must have, even so I would give this show a very strong recommendation.  Basically, its awesome!
0553208845|5.0|I first read the book Siddartha when I was in 7th grade and I enjoyed it immensely. I was told by many teachers that it was much too profound for me and that I would not grasp it. I do admit that I didn't make the connection between Siddartha and Buddha, but I wish someone had been there to guide me through it instead of squelching my will to read.<br /><br />I am now in my junior year of High School and it still remains one of my favorite books. I recommend it highly for 7th grade up. It really opened my eyes to a whole section of the Earth I had been neglecting to pay any attention too. I took a spiritual journey vicariously through Siddartha and came out a better, more worldly individual. This is a great book for parents and teachers alike to sit down and have discussions with kids about and allow children to formulate their own opinions. It's a great read as well as an eye-opener and I encourage everyone to check it out.
B00000I8UE|4.0|I love Miles Davis and have barely listened to Cassandra Wilson so this was a risky venture; in the end it was worthwhile. I was curious what an artist could do by changing the original Miles songs into something new, replacing his horn with a voice, adding lyrics and creating a differnt song essentially. Beginning with Miles's excellent \\"Run The VooDoo Down\\" I was drawn in with a positive attitude. The following track, a Cassandra Wilson composition entitled \\"Travelling Miles\\" was very tasty with nice runs on sax by Steve Wilson and echoing Wilson's vocals as a chorus. It is a moody piece, part blues, part jazz, all good. From this point on the disc suddenly tries to capture the many colors of the musical world by adding a slew of instruments that seem to not fit together. Marimbas with slide guitar on one track, on others harmonicas, mandolins, vibraphone, violin and even classical guitar(more on that later). I wish she would have incorporated a trumpet since that was Miles's instrument. Does this musical stew work? Surprisingly, yes, for the most part. The mixture is tasteful and done in such a manner that it is suttle and never overpowering. She lets her voice and the power of Miles songs take control. Outstanding tracks are the aforementioned, \\"Run The VooDoo Down\\" from Miles's \\"Bitches Brew,\\" as well as the \\"VooDoo Reprise,\\" the eloquent phrasing on Cyndi Lauper's\\" Time After Time,\\" the undertoned stylings and  jazzy vocals on \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" complete with mandolin and violin interludes and \\" Sky and Sea\\" that features Pat Metheny on a classical guitar solo and Cassandra's smoky vocals. The disc overall is pretty good , it is a slow and bluesy musical tribute fit for a rainy day or late night reflexions. Recommended for jazz aficionados or some one that wants to hear what has been done with the music of Miles Davis.
1896597890|4.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down.  Hats off to Guy Delisle who cronicled his experiences so vividly in this anami-style diary.  My only regret was that it was too short and ended rather abruptly. <br /> <br />The strength of this book lies not with Mr Delisle's wry sence of humor, which is refreshingly funny, but in the depiction of Kim Jong Il and all his bizzarness, which, unfortunately, a whole country must suffer through.
B00006878K|3.0|This may be the album that made the man but it's not his best work.  The clips above are by far the best part of the album.  Less than simple blues leads, wrong notes played in several places with attempts to cover it by horns are noticible.  The horn section on a couple of the songs is down right disturbing.
075640407X|5.0|The story is engaging, the world is interesting, and the flow is just right.  I even hate all flashback-type stories, and I think this one rocks. <br /> <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Truly one of the greatest records of all time gets the 5-star treatment in this reissue.  If you don't already know that the album is one of the top 5 studio records ever released, you haven't listened.  Fantastic from start to finish.  No need to review song by song - it is simply the best collection from one of the very best performers in rock and roll history.<br /><br />The anniversary package is very nice.  First of all, the record itself gets an excellent remastering.  It sounds great.  The concert bonus DVD catches Bruce and the always excellent E-Street Band hitting foreign shores in England as the record hype-machine was shifting into high gear with the release of Born to Run.  The show captured on the DVD is an excellent look at the band in this era.  The concert is a good one and features a nice cross section of Bruce music to that date.  The final disc - a documentary look back at the making of the Born to Run album - is very interesting and a joy for Bruce fans.<br /><br />The anniversary set is well worth the price.  These type of releases are not always done well.  But this time they got it right and did a truly great album the justice it deserves.
0440234743|3.0|This was a summer reading choice for incoming juniors in high school. My 16 year old did not choose it but I decided to read it since it was on the list. I am really surprised that it was on a high school reading list. I knew Grisham's books from the past and found them generally escapist and entertaining, but gave them up after reading four or five.  <br /> <br />I love long books, but for some reason I found this one too long. I finished it because I wanted to know the ending. Congrats since I did not predict it! Overall, though, it was not a satisfying read for all the time I put in. <br /> <br />One of the main characters is a missionary, so I expected some religious overtones, but the writing came off as contrived and forced in that respect. Just ok. <br />
0142000655|5.0|I had the realization earlier in the year that I missed out on reading a lot of great books while at school.  I can't remember the exact reason why I picked up this book but had read that it was John Steinbeck's greatest personal accomplishment.  I also saw that it was part of the Oprah's Book Club.  [...] all of her books but was curious on why she picked it.  I had tried to read Grapes of Wrath several years before but never got through it.  I just finished the book this morning and can see why it has such an impact on American Literature.       The story begins with the description of the surrounding areas of the Salinas Valley in California and then moves east to start the saga of a young family in Connecticut.  It follows the story of a father motivated by the military and the rearing of his two sons. The Sons grow to learn that there father was not what they expected and they have different ideas on how to live their lives.  Mixed with the stories of the brothers are the tales of the Wright family.  We watch the brothers grow up, move apart and one becomes a father to two more boys and the problems that faced the preceding family are recycled and repeated.      As you can tell from the title biblical themes run through the story.  Steinbeck takes the story of Cain and Abel and applies it to an American family plagued by sacrifices and the struggles between good and evil.  The thought that history and human nature does not predestine us as good or bad seems to be the prevailing thought in this book.  There is choice inside of us that we can use to make decisions.
B000O178BY|5.0|After the more mainstream and radio friendly With Teeth from 2005, it seemed like Trent Reznor was going through what seemed to be a mid-life crises. But now it seems that it was just him trying to figure out if he could still make music. That fact being proven, Trent now decided to take his work a little more seriously. The culmination of this (and numerous recording sessions during breaks in between shows during the 2005-06 With Teeth tour) is Year Zero.<br /><br />Year Zero (YZ) features 16 tracks, making it the second longest Nine INch Nails (NIN) album next to 1999's \\"The Fragile\\". The sound of YZ is much more in line with NIN's industrial roots, but even more so, it draws on the sounds of electro clash, drum and bass and minimalist techno. In other places it features classical piano. Yet in the end, YZ has the unmistakable sound of Trent Reznor's work.<br /><br />YZ is also a concept album, with an interesting science fiction/political storyline going on throughout it. There is also an \\"Alternative Reality Game\\" going on to promote the album, which in itself helps bolster the otherwise boring and hackneyed \\"packaging\\" that the album would normally have had if it were any other CD. To engage in this so called ARG, one should seek out the official Nine Inch Nails website or \\"The NIN WIKI\\".<br /><br />The choice picks from this album would be the following:<br /><br />-The \\"My Sharona\\" drum pattern using \\"The Beginning of the End\\", which might have a cliche title (and drum beat), but its sound is as refreshing and invigorating as a blast of adrenaline mixed with licking an electric socket when it seems like the fight has just turned against you.<br /><br />-The haunting and beautiful \\"The Good Soldier\\", which has some very thought provoking lyrics and rhyming built into it. The best part comes at the end when it transforms from a stripped down bass driven industrial track to a \\"Fragile\\"-esque piano laden track with a mixture of electronic goodness.<br /><br />-Sleeze and power tripping (something NIN is known best for) sets in on the track \\"Vessel\\". This track in particular features a mess of thundering choruses and a break down section of chaotic and erratic industrial and minimalist techno noises. Some electro house is thrown in as well for good measure. If anything, this is definitely one of the tracks that Reznor said: \\"You could f*** to..\\"<br /><br />-The political (and ALMOST) ambiguous \\"Capital G\\", which features some clever humor and loud, grinding guitar moments. Rather than trying to describe this track, it should just be heard! You will most likely hear it since it has been chosen [Edit: as of the time this review was written] to be the second single off of the album.<br /><br />-And the thundering, overpowering \\"Meet Your Master\\", which rings in memories of NIN's \\"Broken\\", along with some more beautiful, loud electronic chaos. This track has it all: A strong chorus, Trent's signature creepy thoughts, catchy hooks and a layering of distortion guitars and noisy synthesizers.<br /><br />In actuality, this album really does not have any dull moments. There is enough change up and diversity that keeps the album from ever growing stale. The only concern I have is that with such a climatic and \\"apocalyptic\\" end track on the album, how will there be a sequil to this concept album*? Perhaps we'll find out more as the storyline for Year Zero progresses...<br /><br />As you can judge from the star rating, this reviewer was ONE happy customer with the purchase of YZ. It is a delight to see that NIN is still capable of making fresh music that is both good and thought provoking. I HIGHLY recommend picking up YZ, as well as also at least giving the accompanying ARG that the album has going on with it.br /> <br />-Sleeze and power tripping (something NIN is known best for) sets in on the track \\"Vessel\\".

B000JJSJR8|3.0|At 178 minutes long, I was expecting to be bored throughout this film, despite everyone raves about this film, along with Goodfellas. And although I did get a bit restless during it, I did find myself sucked into the film and actually trying to work out what was going to come next.<br /><br />It starts off with a shocking scene, and then is told in retrospective (or so you think), from ten years previously. I certainly sat up straight up when the film started, as this is the scene you're not expecting. Although when it's repeated towards the end, it does tend to go OTT, by showing it from every angle, and showing the viewer what exactly happened.<br /><br />Visually, the film is very bright, with the neon lights of the casino, and Robert De Niro's colour blinding suits (who puts pink & orange together?!) Honestly when he first walked onto the screen, I thought his wardrobe was made up by a colour-blind person, as most of his suits were OTT bright, or clashed severely. The brightness of the casino is so well done in HD, you almost start to feel like you're there, it's so real, and captures the bright lights of Vegas perfectly.<br /><br />I thought Sharon Stone's role was the best out of the entire film, as her character goes through such a journey during the film, and the physical changes in her character are shocking. Her character of Ginger is an ex-hooker, who marries Robert De Niro's character, despite not loving him in the slightest. I think she was seeing dollar signs before her eyes. She becomes a mother, and also turns to drink, which ultimately, leads to a shocking end.<br /><br />This film is definitely not for the fainthearted. There's a closeup scene of someone snorting cocaine, and Sharon's character, Ginger, snorts some in front of her daughter. The F word is said a grand total of 422 times, a bit unnecessary, including in the narration, which makes it a total of 2.4 times per MINUTE on average. The chain smoking is quite harsh as well, as Robert De Niro constantly had a cigarette in his hand in nearly every single scene. (I pity any non-smoking crew on set.) It was necessary to portray what it was like in those days, when smoking was considered classy, and not frowned upon as it is today. I expected there to be some continuity problems that accompanies a chain-smoking character but Robert always held his cigarettes the same distance from the lit end so that their lengths never appear to change.<br /><br />This film impressed me, and I can imagine it looks so much better in HD, so it would definitely be better than the old regular DVD. But everyone lumping it along with Goodfellas doesn't bode well, cos everyone HAS to like Goodfellas it seems. It's definitely one to watch on HD, and with a TV that's more like a cinema screen would be good too!t De Niro constantly had a cigarette in his hand in nearly every single scene.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|I'm a fan of all rock, everything from alternative, to hard rock to just a little bit of pop rock, and From what i've heard so far, this album will either be a bust, or be popular, cause Mike Sings more than raps, which was a big part in their old great stuff.  <br />     Minutes to Midnight will not be popular with true Linkin Park fans who loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora, so Linkin Park will lose a portion of their fans, so they will have to depend on a new fan base.  <br />     I'll give this album a shot, but if I don't like it, they will lose this fan.
0743496728|3.0|I've read every single Jodi Picoult book, and as of late have been kind of disappointed. She is tackling strong subjects, but they seem to lack something her earlier writings have. Her others were well woven stories, while this is just trying to show you the subject of a school shooting from all perspectives. I felt this to be an extremely interesting subject, so I ran out and bought the hardcover the day it was released.<br /><br />While well written and controversial, this book depressed me. Reading it was intense, and did bring up a good deal of questions. It made you sympathize with Peter(the shooter), which in the light of recent events, you'd think would be difficult to do.<br /><br />I found myself really feeling awful about human nature and how people treat each other. I would recommend this book purely for the subject matter, but not necessarily for the story. I wish she would go back to story telling instead of these 'he said, she said' type of books. I almost have the feeling that she knows just the topic by itself with put her on the top ten list. I wish I could put my finger on what it was really lacking. hopefully I will come up with it and revise my review.
0060887966|5.0|The Alchemist is one of those rare books that both entertains and teaches. Richly textured with subtle meaning on so many levels, Coelho's work must be read multiple times for the reader to fully grasp all that the author has to impart.  Coelho combines allegory, Christian symbolism, and stunning imagery in this coming of age tale.  Through the adventures of the protagonist, Santiago, the author reminds us of the importance of listening to our hearts, staying true to our ideals, and forging ahead through adversity in fulfilling our destiny.<br /><br />Both enchanting fable and life instruction guide, The Alchemist transports the reader back to a far simpler age and details the wanderings of a young shepherd boy in following his dream, or \\"Personal Legend.\\"  As Coelho's work so compellingly points out, many of us fail to heed the \\"omens\\" along life's path and as a result are unable to benefit from the \\"Soul of the World\\" in seeking our personal calling. One's journey includes tragedy and triumph and, as we see through the eyes of Santiago, only by embracing the lessons learned from these life experiences is one ultimately able to achieve his dream.<br /><br />Upon reading the Alchemist, we are left to wonder whether we have missed the signposts in our own journey or sacrificed our dreams at the altar of familial or societal expectations. Coelho's depiction of Santiago's journey reveals the infinite possibility in each and every one of us.  Perhaps most important, Coelho reminds us of the boundless rewards lying at the end of our path should we listen to that little voice in all of us and persevere in our journey.<br /><br />The Alchemist is an extraordinary piece of storytelling and belongs in every enlightened reader's library. It is a must read for those experiencing a life-changing event or pursuing a new direction in their lives.<br /><br />Coelho's message is one for the ages.  Enjoy!
B000NA28I4|1.0|great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|If there was one film I'd bring to a desert island, this film is it. I first watched it when I was 16 years old, and I've been dying to see this film fully restored on DVD. I'm sorry, but the 2006 BBC TV Series cannot hold a candle to this film. There's no sense of irony or grittiness here. Just unalloyed, unabashed, enthusiastic fun. Younger modern audiences used to the postmodern cynicism of the BBC TV Series or the terrible Kevin Costner attempt might have difficulty with the tone. But once you can set aside your doubts, this film is an absolutely joy to watch from start to finish. <br /> <br />Errol Flynn is, for me, the ultimate Robin Hood. Regardless of how many actors have gone before or after him, he stands tall as the greatest actor to ever play this role. He's matched by Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisbourne. Both play off each other extremely well. And Oliva DeHavilland is still the screen goddess that modern actresses can only aspire to be. <br /> <br />The script is just terrific. Unlike modern action films, the action pieces flow naturally from the plotline, rather than the other way around. And even by today's standards, the swordfights are absolutely jaw-dropping. No CGI. No wirework. And the archery in this film is just incredible. <br /> <br />No doubt about it. This film is a classic - it has stood the test of time, and will probably still be a much loved film 50 years from now. Every lover of great films should have this on his shelf.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is beautiful series to watch. I just have a problem with the editorial comments about global warming, the facts are pretty clear that global warming is happening to all the planets in our solar system and not a \\"human\\" made condition. It's a natural phenom, we are coming out of an ice age after all. I would suggest the editor inform himself/herself a little more on the subject. Many scientific studies available.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this series is a must for nature lovers or lovers of our planet and all it's wonderous creatures.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What a great work of love, of craftsmanship.This is spellbinding, in the  truest sense of the word. Once you have started viewing this fascinating work of art, time, all sense of time, is frozen.It is a transcendent experience,  as you are drawn into the looking glass in front of you for a peek at our world. what a marvel, how so much fits conceptually into the little screen in front of you. it is as breath taking on a small screen as it is on a large screen .it is all just a peephole allowing you to gaze upon our earth. Every shot is beautifully framed. Reverence abounds,and craftsmanship guides you as one marvel after another is revealed .This is an 11 part series each featuring a different aspect of planet earth .\\"from pole to pole\\" \\"caves\\" \\"desert\\" \\"forests\\"\\"jungles\\" great plains\\"\\"shallow seas\\" \\"ocean deep\\"\\"ice worlds\\"\\"seasonal forests\\"\\"fresh water\\".This is not just point and shoot pretty pictures. It shows the beauty for sure, but also the synchronicity.  Those fine lines of interdependency as well as the many obvious interconnections and interdependencies.We all should know what a powerful medium film is, and at it's very best I feel it can stand with the bestof the \\"arts\\" in Music as well as paint and sculpture .I do think this work has proved that point .I was as elevated watching this film as I have been listening to a Beethoven symphony, or a Bach fugue, or viewing the paintings of the masters. <br />I cannot even begin to guess how they captured so much on high resolution film. The time exposures, the vistas , the rituals , and some of natures best kept secrets, , the many forms of unusual life occurring in every corner, nook and cranny, of this beautiful planet so full of life .I cannot wait to view this with my grandchildren, nieces, and nephews,I am sure  it will create memories for them, I am sure of this .There is so much wonderful and wondrous information presented here in this set. knowledge, and the most glorious visuals, capturing our amazing planet earth .This is a most enjoyable experience. share it ,create around it, teachers, families, friends this should be an event not just a film .My wife and I are seriously thinking that we will for one night a week throughout the summer show this on our front lawn. prepare a few simple snacks have the grandchildren and family over and open this up to the neighborhood some lawn chairs, popcorn, blankets, and you have a wonderful summer event .I am sure the children as well as the adults will look forward each week .Yes it is that good.Even if you have never really enjoyed a nature documentary this may well be the exception .If only for the stunning visuals .But I find that the new, odd, often exciting and amazing facts that seem to fill every minute of this great work thrilling .Again I wish to state that the vision of those who put this masterpiece together must be on par with the works of the masters of ages past. this is an achievement in film that boggles the mind in scope and succeeds !It would seem that in our age we also have those who future generations will likely look upon as Masters of their crafts as well. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Come on people, this is a fabulous documentary no matter who's narrating.  I personally liked Sigourney Weaver's narration very much.  While I like David Attenborough's narration as well his voice becomes distracting over time and in a way takes away from the amazing footage.  Like one reviewer already mentioned, Sigourney's narration was clear, calming, articulate and naturalist or not, you can tell she has reverence for the subjects she talks about.  The bottom line is that this is not a documentary on narration and if you're paying more attention to the narrator than the actual subject then you're missing the entire point all together.
1400064287|4.0|This is an interesting and practical book on how to make your ideas catch on... how to take a dull concept laden with boring statistics, and turn it into something that people will remember, and tell their friends.<br /><br />Its not academic, rather its a down to earth how-to manual. Its a good companion to The Tipping Point, which popularized the concept of stickiness... which is the tendency for a person to remember and pass on an idea. They analyzed marketing campaigns, public service messages, and urban legends to determine what sticky ideas have in common. They came up with this basic framework:<br /><br />  * Simplicity: the idea must be stripped to its core, and the most important concepts should jump out.<br /><br />  * Unexpectedness: the idea must destroy preconceived notions about something. This forces people to stop, think, and remember.<br /><br />  * Concreteness: avoid statistics, use real-world analogies to help people understand complex ideas.<br /><br />  * Credibility: if people don't trust you, they'll ignore you. In some cases, they will be openly hostile, which means they'll actively try to dispute your message!<br /><br />  * Emotional: information makes people think, but emotion makes them act. Appeal to emotional needs, sometimes even way up on Maslow's hierarchy.<br /><br />  * Stores: telling a story tricks people into paying closer attention, and feeling more connected. Remember the Jared Subway commercials?<br /><br />The book gives some great examples, and even has some brief homework assignments so you can test how to make a message more sticky. This book isn't just for marketing types... I'd recommend it to anybody who communicates with the public at all.
B00006BSGZ|5.0|EMI released a real treasure with this DVD. You can read a lot about it, but go straight to Tosca's Act II track and you will feel the same excitement, I wonder, Ludwig Borchardt when unearthed Nefertiti's bust in 1912.<br /><br />A priceless moment among the most famous performances in opera history, here preserved complete. If I were an opera singer or student, this DVD will be among my essentials: just look at Callas and Gobbi's faces, gestures (the slight and perverted touch of the feather in Callas hand, by Gobbi) and movements (both circling around Scarpia's table, like predator and victim). That's what opera is meant to be!
1576462676|2.0|i honestly dont understand why people love this book so much.. it may have a cute romance and a good plot but Austen took about five times as long to get her point across as she should have. i considered it work to read this book as it was required for school and didn't enjoy more than about 50 pages!
1400064287|5.0|I develop leaders at a University and I'm always looking for the best books dealing with how to be an effective leader.  This book was so good that I'm going to use it as the main textbook for a class I'm teaching in the fall.   <br /> <br />If what we say as leaders is forgotten, then we just wasted everybody's time; therefore, it's of great importance that we ensure our message will stick in the minds of the people we hope to lead.  Malcolm Gladwell talk about this in The Tipping Point, but it was probably the weakest chapter of his book.  Thankfully Made to Stick was able to expand on the Stickiness Factor and did a much better job of illustrating it than Gladwell did. <br /> <br />I strongly disagree with the reviews stating how hard this book was to finish.  I didn't find it draggin on, in fact, I had a hard time putting the book down.  It was very easy to read and had many references to studies much like The Tipping Point, Blink, or Freakonomics.  What made this book better than those is that this book had idea clinics where you could actually practice what they were talking about.  These clinics made this book much more applicabale then the others that I mentioned earlier.   <br /> <br />If you're want to make sure that what you say doesn't go in one ear and out the other, this is the best book you can find.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The word prestige is most commonly understood as; esteem or importance of an individual who is highly regarded by others. The word is taken from the Latin word præstigum; trick or illusion.<br /><br />People who saw Memento will enjoy Christopher Nolan's \\"The Prestige.\\" He brings to the audience a new and unfamiliar meaning to this word, as he illustrates this through his mastery of storytelling.<br /><br />Story:<br />It is the story of two rival magicians in London near the end of the 1800's. When a magic performance turns tragic both men will go to the extreme of undermining each other to become the best magician. When Alfred Borden invents the trick \\"The Transporter Man,\\" Rupert Angier, becomes obsessed with learning his secret to his Illusion. When Angier meets the scientist Nikola Tesla, he will fine the answer through the device that Tesla makes for him. Will his obsession for Borden come to an end?<br /><br />Review:<br />Every magic trick consists of three acts; the first act is called the pledge, the second act is called the turn and third act is called the prestige. This is where the audience is presented with something shocking and new in which the audience has never seen before.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is an exceptional director, who gives the audience his fourth movie entitled \\"The Prestige.\\" Nolan's style of directing and writing is much like the movie \\"The Illusionist\\" who keeps the audience guessing until the end. His direction is fast paced, but is explained through the series of events that are unfolded throughout the plot. But instead of focusing on magic he wants the audience to concentrate on the obsession that both Magicians (Jackmen and Bale) have for each other.<br /><br />This is done quite effectively through the acting of Bale and Jackman. They completely become immersed in their passion that they have for their magic. Jackman illustrates his obsession through his showmanship and Bale through mastering his skills of magic. The supporting cast led by the veteran screen actor Michael Caine (Cutter the creator of the illusions), Scarlett Johansson (Olivia Wenscombe assistant to Angier) and even David Bowie (Tesla who plays an inventor similar to Thomas Edison) do a very good job at supporting the obsession between the two magicians.<br /><br />The editing was flawless to the point where the flashbacks give the presence of time standing still. There is no choppiness, no hesitation as each scene is played out through the movie.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />This is very good film that deals with magic and showmanship but finds an underlining theme to the movie such as obsession. If your fan of Christopher Nolan and like solving puzzle based movies then you will definitely appreciate \\"The Prestige\\" in which I highly recommend.chael Caine (Cutter the creator of the illusions), Scarlett Johansson (Olivia Wenscombe assistant to Angier) and even David Bowie (Tesla who plays an inventor similar to Thomas Edison) do a very good job at supporting the obsession between the two magicians.

B000AP04NI|5.0|I was so disappointed on receipt of the Oklahoma DVD that it would not work outside of the USA. I am sure it is well the cost.
1582701709|3.0|I'll be honest here.  I do not believe that this book holds some deeply buried unknown piece of information that only an elite group of people over centuries have had access to.  However, I do believe that the book has value and could even be life changing for a small population of people.   <br /> <br />The book can be inspiring and energizing because it reminds us all of things we forget in the daily mess of trying to live life:   <br />1. Being negative rather than positive offers negative results.   <br />2. If you don't believe in yourself what's the point, no one else will.   <br />3.  You reap what you sow.  <br />4.  Be greatful, it matters  <br /> <br />Your response to this book will depend on two things.   <br />1.  Do you need to take this book literally to benefit from it?  If not, if you can look at it as a metaphor for living life, it will be a nice emotional pick me up.   <br />2. If you read it literally and you have never been introduced to quantum physics and the law of attraction, you just may have an earth shaking, life altering experience, that's a big maybe.  If the law of attraction and such is not new to you and you do not believe in the law of attraction and you want to read everything in the book as fact- you will be disappointed and should not by the book because all you will get out of it is another \\"think positive and keep trying lesson\\".   <br /> <br />Myself- I liked the book and it gave me some positive energy when I needed, but no eye-opening secret was revealed.   <br /> <br />The book is short and easy to read and inexpensive so if you need an emotional pick me up, pick up the book.  If not, don't.

B000059MEK|5.0|My friend left 'Discovery' in my car a few months ago and I still haven't returned it.  I was a fan of Daft Punk's singles but never heard a full album by them until now.  I had NO idea how talented this duo is.  This cd gets better and better with each listen.  Every song is solid gold, these are some serious beats!  Whatever mood you're in, you'll find a song that fits it.  I couldn't tell you my favorite track on this album because it changes everytime.  Pick this cd up today, it's truly a work of art and music at it's finest.
B000001FS3|5.0|Yes, I'm back. You must excuse the lapse. I have been busy setting up shelters (a Seer's work), for the chronically wayward or the chronologically confused. It really doesn't matter. It helps people. It's a good cause. Donations are gladly accepted, (and forms for tax write-offs are at the door). Yes, I know it's selfless work. And I have taken a Seer's oath for the good of humanity and I can't back out. Rats. I can't make exceptions but so what? Pure intent is hard to come by these days. They never warned me-whoever \\"they\\" are.<br /><br />That being said, I have come here to review an exceptional, exceptional work by U2.  These guys never cease to amaze me, and little did I know when they first arrived into my conciousness. I thought at the beginning \\"how nice, another typical 80's band\\", for I really wasn't impressed by them.  The Edge's guitar grated on me and I couldn't adjust to the sound.  But, glad to say, U2 were not to be deprived of their just place in the hierarchy of rock. They have built a tabernacle of considerable and reflective music over time.  And, I must say, the quality and workmanship and thought and care that go into their profferings are nothing less than astounding. They care deeply about the music they make and present it to us in a way that many do not. It is this diligency towards excellence that comes to the forefront each and every time.<br /><br />Admittedly, I do not know alot about their history or how they came into being. I don't think that it matters in the least with music this good. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jnr. have created their own unique sound, their own unique journey towards salvation and universal concerns. With \\"The Joshua Tree\\", they reveal their search, achingly, to God and to all heavenly powers. They reveal their weaknesses, their human frailties, and take us on a voyage of discovery and enlightenment. They take us on a journey of strength. And these are just a few of the things that set them apart from most.<br /><br />To begin with, the Edge's guitar work is outerworldy, and I cannot attempt to explain it to anybody. It can be subtle and sweet and then turn into virile, powerful excursions somewhere that defy description. Whatever he uses (is it a synthesizer?) to make it sound this way-he has definitely created his own unique sound that nobody can copy.  You can hear pure emotion in his playing- and this is just one component to U2.<br /><br />Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen provide the considerable skeletal backbone which gives their sound such heft. They provide the balance to the sound. There is no grandstanding here-but essential stability that compliment The Edge in every single way. Professional and clear, they weave the tapestry, the contour that great edifices are built upon.<br /><br />And what of Bono? Perhaps the glue that ties it all together. He is probably the most known member of this band, and alot of the reason may lie in his poetry and delivery. He sings from his soul- and he puts the full range of human emotion into his delivery. He doesn't hold back and it shows in songs like \\"With Or Without You\\" or \\"\\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" with the urgency and compassion of the line \\"I'm still waiting-I'm hanging on- You're all that's left to hang on to\\". These vocals are so impassioned that they send shivers out. Yes, he's that good.<br /><br />But what of the songs here and their meaning? It seems that Mr. Bono has thoughts of sheer martydom running throughout many of these tunes. Plus, many of the poetic inferences harken back to Christianity or spiritual uplifting in some way. He wants to break free and evolve to a place where \\"The Streets Have No Name\\". Could this be heaven? Or, a place where things are not categorized?  And after speaking with Angels and holding the hand of the devil- he is in-between and \\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\". The eternal search of salvation and redemption. \\"With or Without You\\" is just pure genius.  Allusions to Christ with \\"See the STONE set in your eyes, see the THORN twist in your side\\". But, not only that, but, \\"On a bed of NAILS, she makes me wait\\". And, furthermore, \\"my hands are tied-my body bruised\\". It seems that the relationship in this song has made Bono a martyr of sorts. And, in a strange way, Christ can't live with or without you either. So entirely remarkable. So many biblical terminology throughout- the drout conveyed with the lines \\"the rivers run, but soon run dry\\" in \\"In God's Country\\". \\"Thunder, thunder in the mountain, there's a rain cloud in the desert sky\\" in \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\". There are many more examples. The need for human relief, and elevation, whether it be from a bruised relationship or inner spiritual need, is foremost and deeply embedded within the poetry. Many discoveries await here. Many gems to mine. All yours for the asking.<br /><br />In closing- a superb achievement for a group relatively new into their career. The landscapes are a wonder and the music on a higher and grandiose level that satisfys so fully in the pop/rock genre. I cannot say enough.<br /><br />And now, I think I finally have gotten the courage to ask Bono for a donation to my shelters. That is, if I can even get his public relations agent on the phone. But regardless, I can always play this c.d. for my clients. Get it. It's a classic.<br /><br />Refreshingly subtle and amazingly devout--your own, MetamorphoONE set in your eyes, see the THORN twist in your side\\".

I HAVE OVER 3400 CDS AND AVRIL'S FIRST TWO CDS ARE IN THE TOP 200 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. THIS ALBUM WILL BE KNOWN AS ONE OF THE WORST. WORSE THAN ANY BRITNEY ALBUM. GET ASHLEE SIMPSON INSTEAD,HER CDS ROCK AT LEAST. WE PLAYED THIS 4 TIMES AND COULD NOT FIND ANY GOOD SONGS. EVERY SONG ON HER FIRST TWO CDS WAS EITHER GOOD OR GREAT. WHAT WENT WRONG?? THIS IS DISPOSABLE THROWAY BUBBLEGUM POP AT IT'S WORST. WE WISH AVRIL HAD DONE A COUNTRY OR CHRISTIAN CD EVEN, THAN THIS PAP.LET US HOPE AVRIL MAKES A ROCK, PUNK, METAL ALBUM NEXT AND TAKES SOME FEEDBACK AND ADVICE FROM FANS, AND MUSICIANS.WE HOPE AVRIL GETS DIFFERENT BETTER PRODUCERS AND BETTER MUSICIANS AND A LITTLE CONSTRUCTIVE HELP WRITING SONGS. AVRIL WE LOVE YOU STILL. WE ARE FANS AND WILL STILL BUY YOUR NEXT CD, BUT ONE MORE LIKE THIS COULD PUT YOU ON BROADWAY WITH DEBBIE GIBSON. STILL GREAT FANS YET.  JOHN FREES, GALVESTON, TEXAS
B00005RHGK|3.0|This is a fun time at the movies... especially the first part of the film.<br /><br />But after a wonderful beginning, it does fizzle. The plot gets nonsensical and they show WAY too much of the monster. Should have taken a page from the first 'Alien' or from 'Jaws'.<br /><br />It's no slasher flick, so pass if that's you're style. This is a nod to those simple but suspenseful horror films of the 70's (Duel comes to mind, as does Race With the Devil). And this movie includes a big amount of Alfred Hitchcock suspense, with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in.<br /><br />There are plot holes, yes... but there's no perfect scary film, really. And there are a couple of those cheap \\"jump\\" moments (you know, when there's a loud sting of music as a character pops into view out of nowhere; it's been done to absolute death in so many horror films, it's the biggest dead horse in Hollywood, and I wish directors and writers would stop that once and for all).<br /><br />And yet I've got to give this movie credit for a few terrific things, including but not limited to: the realistic presentation of the siblings on a road trip in Florida, the discovery of something very creepy, and what the brother finds underground. These things alone were really done nicely. I wish I had seen this in the movie theater instead of on dvd.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Dont get me wrong. I love All Eyez On Me. It was one of the best albums of 96 but it was missing the political side of Pac. The conscious side. On this album you get Pac's anger at other rappers but you also get some insight like White Man's World, Blasphemy and Krazy. Its unfortunate to hear the diss tracks like Bomb First and Against All Odds get more mention over White Man's World and Krazy but I understand where most people's heads are at. Standout tracks: BOMB FIRST, HAIL MARY, TOSS IT UP, TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA, BLASPHEMY, LIFE AS AN OUTLAW, KRAZY, WHITE MAN,S WORLD, ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND and AGAINST ALL ODDS. Filler: I never felt Just Like Daddy. Bottom Line: In 96, Pac droppped to classics, All Eyez On Me and The Don Killuminati. Pac's rhymes were great, the production was different but good. All in all it was a great album.
1400032717|5.0|This is a great book similar to Flowers for algernon. It's about an autistic boy who writes a book based on his life and a neighbor's book that he found dead. The way that he sees things in his mind is so different from the rest of us it's truly amazing and interesting. Fast read. He views colors differently from us, he does not have any emotion and does not understand humor or laughter and he operates like a computer. you just have to love this boy! this book is very very funny as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are so many reviews as to the positive qualities of the show that there isn't much I can add so I will go a different route. Why was such a good show canceled?! Some of the more hardcore fans already know but for those of you who don't ...  The executives at Fox never \\"got\\" the show. They just did not understand what the appeal would be. The only reason they agreed to it at all was because of the man behind it, Joss whedon. Joss had been the man behind some very successful (profitable) shows, like Angel and Buffy. Fox made some major errors in regards to the production of the show that turned out to be fatal. Joss created a two part, two hour episode that was to be the first episode aired and would lay the groundwork for the series, introduce characters, touch on their backgrounds etc.. . Fox decided that two hours of developing characters would not appeal to viewers and instead wanted a one hour episode with a lot of action instead. The series was broadcast out of sequence and the two hour episode was actually aired last. The Fox  execs essentially kept trying to dumb down the show to appeal to the lowest common denominator and hopefully the most people. They did not believe that enough viewers were smart enough and had enough of an attention span to sit through adult dialog. Then Fox canceled it mid-season. It didn't even get one full season. They essentially sabotaged the season and then because the ratings weren't good right away they pulled it. A remarkable number of devoted fans of today had never even known that the show even existed back when it was originally aired. There is much more to it than that but that is the gist of it.

0385495323|5.0|This was a very easy reading book-- in spite of the level of sophistication of some of the ideas. It is also very good how the author reviews just enough math for what you will need to know in order to understand some of the ideas in codebreaking.<br /><br />There are also lots of nuggets of knowledge for people who like trivia-- such as the contribution of the Navajo to the war effort by the use of their language, or the Poles to codebreaking technology because of their being in between two hostile neighbors. It is also often not understood the level of aggression of the Germans during WWII and how much thought went into the military strategies of the various nations.<br /><br />The prose is clear and concise. This is defnitely worth a second read.<br /><br />As a final testatment to how absorbing this book was: I read most of it on a train traveling through China while seated in a car that held about 150 other people (in spite of being designed for 105), and that was so crowded that it was not possible to move down the aisles. This book kept me busy for almost the whole train ride.

I had not skipped to the end as I often do, so I was slightly suprised with the developments in part III. I love the way Sparks had the reader draw their own conclusions concerning John in the end. As with other N. Sparks books, this one does not disappoint!
1582701709|3.0|<br />This book is mainly a compendium of teachings given by various people (authors, doctors, teachers) who attribute their success to the \\"Law of Attraction\\" and these are edited together in an overall theme that in simple words states:  What you think about and feel is ultimately created in your life around you. <br /> <br />Ultimately, books like this will be critiqued as if they are the end-all-be-all answer to our question of life, especially when they gain a lot of popularity.  It is easy to look at them that way, and I definitely see the danger and contradictions another reviewer has effectively argued.  That argument is valid, and what I would like to add is it should be noted that any theory or opinion like this, since it cannot really be proved or disproved, should be seen as a \\"shadow\\" of a much larger answer to our existence.  Even the major religions must be both wrong and right on some things, but are shadows of a much larger truth. <br /> <br />I thought this book was ok. - I didn't love it, because of some inconsistencies and contradictions on the beliefs of the presenters themselves, and it was repetitive, but the overall theme is what should be focused on, while picking and choosing some of the details if you wish.  At the very least it is uplifting and hopeful.  I prefer and have watched the DVD version of this book many times just because it feels good to watch.  I bet you will feel the same way despite any belief you may have for or against it. <br /> <br />But, I propose you read this book for what it is - an OPINION or THEORY on how our life may fit in amongst the larger Universe of things.  Believe every word, disagree with every word, or take little bits and pieces for your own use, but at the very least please don't allow any teaching like this to be just believed or disagreed without experimenting for yourself if it works or not.  Just believing blindly amongst popularity creates nothing more that a fad, and if the information is good information, it will be eventually relegated to the \\"back of the closet\\" like fads eventually do, not getting the purpose it deserves.  Likewise, if the information is bad information and it is blindly followed, then it succeeded in gaining a potentially harmful life it should not have had.  Please make decisions on your own results.  I did.  I believe much of what is described in this book because I have found it works for me.  You should also. <br /> <br />Of course, we or the authors cannot know if everything this book tries to teach is true or not, but we can judge it according to what humans have observed since even ancient times.  In keeping with this, it has been observed that virtually every successful (economical, physical, social, emotional, spiritual etc.) person in our recorded history has not discounted the quality of what they think about.  Whether it be through positive thoughts only or prayer to gods or God, many can agree that observation has shown they work one way or another, although not all the time, and certainly not magically, but with some type of powerful emotion mixed with action.  And most societies, modern or ancient, believe one way or another in results based on the quality of their thoughts (prayer is a thought, right?).  In my mind, the theory of the Law of Attraction can be argued to be the same thing as prayer, just named differently and described the way it should be but has been watered down over many years - Positive thoughts mixed with powerful emotion, then action bringing the intended result.   <br /> <br />I believe the teachings in this book are basically a new spin on what religions have been teaching for centuries - to pray - although in an updated form without the religion surrounding it.  After all, when you pray, such as for a loved one to get better from a sickness, do you just say the words or do you picture that person in your mind clearly, feeling better?  Which would be more effective?  And does God, god, Allah, theUniverse care if I say an \\"Our Father\\" or if I just put positive images in my mind that could help others?  When I go to sleep at night, I picture my 2 year old son healthy, my wife smiling, and my job still there to support my family.  I'll never give up positive thinking mixed with strong emotion and action.  That's MY prayer, and the Secret, (Law of Attraction, prayer, positive thinking, whatever you call it) - whether you believe in it or not, it exists in one form or another, one name or another, one way or another. <br />
B000MZHW40|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I had steered clear of this film in theaters because - Oscar-nomination notwithstanding - I dreaded the notion of potentially spending 143 minutes with Leonardo DiCaprio doing a bad South African accent in Dolby Mondo Super StereoSurround.  I mean, I have already in my lifetime endured Kevin Costner's Robin Hood and Brad Pitt's Troy on the big screen (who could forget Brad screaming \\"Take it - it's YAWWWWS!\\" in his British-by-way-of-Brooklyn accent?  And don't even ask me to describe Costner's...).  So, even though others assured me that Leo nailed the accent, I hope you can understand why I wouldn't want to risk another American Movie Star Mangling of an overseas accent in a heightened sensory environment.<br /><br />But now that I've viewed this film in the safety of my own home with my crappy TV speakers (and my pause button at the ready), I must say that not only did DiCaprio nail the accent, but he concurrently crafted his best character and performance to date in Daniel Archer, the jaded, seen-it-all diamond smuggler who - just as the main character Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) hides and buries a valuable diamond - has hidden and buried his humanity deep within himself.  And though he sets off to find Solomon's diamond, we also see whether he can unearth his humanity along the way.  Leo adds an amazing muscular menace and aged world-weariness that I honestly didn't think he was capable of (and this is from someone who already appreciated him as an actor) (if not a dialectician).<br /><br />The performance by Djimon Hounsou as stoic fisherman Solomon Vandy is almost equally stellar.  We invest in the quest completely as the wise and quiet Solomon (whose wife calls him \\"Solo\\") sets off alone and separated from his family, trying to find his son, who is (to him) infinitely more valuable than the diamond he has buried.  Jennifer Connelly (who, unbeknownst to the director, had already done a lot of work with UNICEF when she was cast) also adds depth in what could have been a throwaway and/or cliched role as the brash American photojournalist Maddy Bowen.<br /><br />Finally, enough cannot be said about director Ed Zwick, who has already spent a good deal of his career perfecting the balance of the action movie and the more contemplative, message-driven drama (Glory, Courage Under Fire, The Last Samurai to name a few).  With \\"Blood Diamond,\\" he most successfully negotiates the territory between conventional action movie entertainment and more political, emotional, and darker material.<br /><br />For the action scenes, the constant camera movement creates not only a documentary feel to the incessant and chaotic scenes of combat, but a sense of urgency to the events (eventually) found in the frame.  The violence is almost too real, and the acts perpetrated (in many cases by children) are almost too disturbing - such a gorgeous land frames such unspeakably evil acts, which ultimately adds greater weight to the messages of the film.<br /><br />As to the message, I've heard complaints that this movie tries to bludgeon you with its politics, but I found it to actually be quite subtle, the speechifying kept to a minimum and, when employed, use to enhance and advance the arc/understanding of the character as much as the overarching ideology.<br /><br />And, for me, the \\"would you put a diamond on your finger if you knew it cost someone their hand\\" motif - while tremendously important - is just one theme among many in this nuanced and layered work.  The film also manages to effortlessly examine other issues, such as: what is truly more valuable, material possessions or human empathy?  Where is the line between journalism and exploitation, and when is it appropriate (if ever) to cross that line?  Finally, can speaking up help change the world, and furthermore can a nation's problems be helped through the advocacy of foreign visitors, who may actually know little about the culture they are trying to change?<br /><br />While Zwick and his cast may or may not be changing the world with this (mostly) American movie about an African problem, at the very least he has made an exceptionally moving film - whether you're in the mood to be educated or entertained.? <br /> <br />While Zwick and his cast may or may not be changing the world with this (mostly) American movie about an African problem, at the very least he has made an exceptionally moving film - whether you're in the mood to be educated or entertained.
B000268QB2|4.0|I like this album.  It seems to be the latest in a series of heartfelt, melodic, classic British power pop productions, the others of course being Coldplay, Travis, Snow Patrol...  While I don't think Keane are quite as charming as Travis, their songs are about human situations you will recognize from your own life, and the falsetto truly soars above staccato chords that shift keys nimbly.  As I listened, some of the best songs - like \\"Bend and Break\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing\\" (sure to be most listener's favorite, as it is just about irresistible) were the most familiar-sounding.  And, no, it wasn't because they sound like Coldplay.  Finally, it occurred to me: The Raspberries.  Songs like \\"Go All the Way\\" have those minor key choruses, flat notes, and soaring choruses - they are melodically close to Keane.  This isn't really a criticism.  Most good bands nowadays remind listeners of someone from the '60s.  My only gripe is that this album can seem a little musically repetitive.  There are one or two slower songs, but varying the arrangements and the keyboard style and the song structures would have made it just a bit stronger.  But this is a minor thing.  Buy this excellent album.
B00005J6UP|3.0|Firstly, I didn't see this movie until I was an adult, so I may have liked it more if I had been 12, but anyway... <br /> <br />The movie is a great concept. The actors do a reasonable job. It paces o.k. The sets were good to very good.  <br /> <br />The problems that make it average? Richard Donner's direction was average (it all seemed too cropped), the cinematography was poor, especially given the potential of the sets, the editing abysmal, and the sound/dialog was crap. If you're going to tell the story via action and dialog versus paced exposition, you might want the dialog to be front and center in the sound mix. When half the dialog is garbled, and no exposition, you're lost pretty quick, and the events that follow make little or no sense. <br /> <br />In all the production was second rate considering the involvement of Donner and Spielberg. Basically what could have been a movie on the scale of a Back to the Future sunk to B-movie level. It was only saved by the story itself, and reasonably good acting. As it stands, I like the idea much more than the execution.
0393317552|5.0|It seems trite to say it, but this book should be required reading for human beings. Diamond is engaging; he's authoritative but able to speak to the non-expert. And the perspective he offers is priceless. I consider this one of the most important books I've ever read.
0880381736|3.0|When friends, companions and warriors return to the predetermined meeting point after several years all is not well in the land. Half-elf Tanis, Tas the jolly Kender, Sturm the chivalrous knight, Flint the dwarf and the twins Caramon and Raistlin are back home, yet they have come by neither answers nor been met with peace.<br /><br />The land of Krynn is overrun by mysterious creatures called Draconians who serve dark masters and worship darker gods. Where this malevolence comes from is not yet clear. Armed with magic and abetted by the appearance of dragons no race is safe from the menace.<br /><br />Dragons Of Autumn Twilight is fast-paced, colourful and seeks to establish the characters involved. The early work of frequent co-authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman is rough around the edges and endures several coincidences too cosy with the story such as imprisonment behind bars of bamboo, dragons who fail to kill or wicker dragons which fool the troops, but not our heroes. The story also bears the occasional close resemblance to the famed Lord Of The Rings saga given its races, quest, travels and even a fortress full of evil troops surging out in the reverse direction of our protagonists. There is even a nod to the authors' future books, The Death Gate Cycle Of Reincarnation series, when an absent-minded yet powerful aging mage becomes the companions' road-fellow.<br /><br />The Chronicles, Volume 1 is fun, swift and packed with the fundamentals of the genre, yet could also be considered imperfect and obvious.
B0002B15WE|4.0|John MaClane (Bruce Willis) a cop from New York is meeting his estranged wife at her office christmas party in a high rise in LA. At the same time a group of terrorists/robbers is plotting to steal the bank bonds that are sitting in the company safe - and so McClane is plunged into a cat and mouse game, which will test all his resourcefulness...<br /><br />Even after all these years this is still a great action film. It is brilliantly directed by John McTiernan who utilises all the nooks and crannies of the building to create a real sense of cat and mouse. There is also plenty of warmth and humour in the story to help relieve the unrelenting tension.<br /><br />Like all good films Die Hard contains characters that we really care about. Like all good action films this is combined with spectacular action. The only thing that counts against it is that it goes on a bit long. Otherwise it is a near-perfect action film.

Then I saw the CD on sale at WalMart and went home and pulled it up on my musicmatch account and within 20 seconds my mouth was hanging open. WOW. It's like the Deftones married Mars Volta but a hundred times better. I bought A Beautiful Lie and it's good, but not as good as this one.

The book is a must buy for novice and pros alike.

0441009425|5.0|Over the last few years, I returned to my sci-fi interests and have been searching for a book worth my time.  Revelation Space fulfilled my search and is one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read.   <br /> <br />The author weaves science fact into the story and does an outstanding job of extrapolating our current technologies into a world full of possibilities.  I was especially keen to see his use of characters which were blends of machines and humans, as this was a very believable next step for our current society.   <br /> <br />The story revolves around several independent stories at the start.  Each story is told in just the right size segments, which leaves the reader wanting more without shortchanging him/her.  Often in the sci-fi or fantasy genre, one or more of the independent stories seems like filler and tends to bore me, but each of these were interesting, and I was always excited to jump back into a particular character's situation. <br /> <br />Extremely well written, intelligent, and futuristically plausible - I will be reading all of Alastair Reynolds books.  If you are searching for sci-fi worth your hard-earned money, I don't think you could find anything better.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is a great album.  Simply put.  The released singles aren't even the best songs on the album.  Also, Stephen Marley is an incredible producer.  This isn't a rambling of worthless lyrics you get on most dancehall albums.  Damian is an incredible lyricist.  One song did it for me, \\"There For You.\\"  That song alone is worth buying the whole album.  Get Halfway Tree too.  Another wonderful album by Jr.  And Stephen's new album is genius as well.
B000929AJQ|4.0|This album was a comeback of sorts.  After the amazing, yet poor selling The Fragile, Trent needed a hit.  Much like the Velvet Underground did with Loaded, he churned out a lean mean album, chock full of hits.  Unfortunately, by doing so, he lost the depth and intelligence of previous albums.  While I've listened to this a ton, it's usually more for the singles than for the entire album.  As such, your opinion of the album depends on the type of music goer you may be.  While some perfer the entire album effect, others are in it solely for the singes.  This album is for those who like catchy songs, surrounded by industrial music.
B000LPS47U|4.0|If you're looking for a schlocky horror movie with lots of excess gore, some gratuitous nudity, a mad scientist, and a reanimated body carrying its head around with it, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Re-Animator is one of those films you hear about as a horror fan, and after watching it it's very clear why. Reanimator is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek horror. Without ever cracking a joke, the film exudes campiness and a bit of sadistic humor.<br /><br />When Herbert West arrives at medical school and answers medical student Dan Cain's request for a roommate, the fast paced story takes a big leap. All the characters are a bit out there. Dr. Hill, the evil professor with a \\"thing\\" for the uptight Dean's daughter, who Cain happens to be engaged to, sets out to steal the research that West has worked on. The research that has resulted in the glowing green substance that brings dead tissue back to life.<br /><br />Re-Animator stays exciting the entire time, and the story never lets up. And the final climactic showdown between the med students (West and Cain) and the re-animated and headless Dr. Hill is the stuff of horror legend. Don't miss it.
B00030590I|5.0|This movie moved me in a way that I wasn't prepared for.  I have never been a big fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or those movies. However, this movie took it to a level almost beyond comprehension.  Almost every shot in the movie was beautiful enough to be a painting.  The grace of action, mixed with the tranquility of story was wonderful.  The use of multiple versions of the same story was a nice homage to Rashoman, but done in a entirely different way, keeping the feeling unique.  The story encompassed the passion of love, anger, and hatred, and the way by which they tug at a persons heart and soul.  When I put this movie in the DVD player, I was expecting a simple Jet Li action movie, but what I got was something that will last with me forever.  One of the best of its kind ever made.

Eisenheim realizes that not only Sophie could be grave danger, but he must stop a mad man from reaching power. So, Eisenheim faces his greatest challenge ever. To come up with an illusion, that can save Sophie and stop the prince at the same time.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I bought the special edition of this CD.  I loved the songs.  I've never been an Avril fan but this album had an angry, scream 'I hate you' at the top of your lungs vibe to it so I did really love this album.  I love angry music.  She also experiments with different styles she's never tired before such as dance and a little rap.  I also loved songs such as I Don't Have To Try which show her as wearing the pants.  The whole album is angry.  The problem?  well for one thing the DVD that came with the special edition showed that she didn't feel a single thing she wrote but rather just wrote whatever she came up with while she was drunk.  She almost seemed to not care about this album at all.  She acts like this is just some dumb homework assignment that she doesn't want to do so she is going to make it into a huge joke.  I can't respect that. Especially when the tone is so strong.  The music is not bad though.  I hated Let Go and Under My Skin was so-so.  I feel like this is her best work.<br /><br />The best tracks are:  I Don't Have To Try, I Can Do Better, The Best Damn Thing, Runaway, and Everything Back But You.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|This movie was a huge disappointment and waste of money.

0375758992|1.0|I stopped reading this book about half-way.  After the author jokingly and flippantly referred to the death of her infant sister (who drowned in a small pond while the author failed to watch the toddler), I had had enough.  How did it change the family?  It made the drunk mother, well, more of a drunk.  How interesting.  There are so many memoirs about drunken, irresponsible families/parents, I guess I'm just losing interest.  And while some are praising her for her \\"candor,\\" I grew weary of all the racism in this book.  Am I supposed to laugh when a little white girl orders around the black house help because she's \\"cheeky?\\"  How about labeling her the selfish, nasty little kid she was.  In fact, the author gladly takes part in the degredation, segregation and insulting of the Africans she is around.  Maybe it got better in the second half, but I really didn't care to know.  I guess reading about white trash Brits who cannot survive in their native country and go reap havoc in Africa just doesn't appeal to me.  The bits of African history, evolution of civil wars (and tenuous resolutions to same) and the flora and fauna of Africa are fascinating.  I also found many of the African people strong and interesting to read about.  I wish she would have stuck to that as opposed to the endless tidbits of her uninteresting and pathetic family life.  Yawn.  I think someone else summed it up best, great locale doesn't make a great life.
B00003CWPL|4.0|This movie is trippy dude.  Is this a dream, hallucination, acid trip, bad joke? I don't know.  It's a junkie's surrealistic Halloween party prank I think.

I've got quite a ways to go before I can conjour up some identifiable or explainable reasons behind this film other than pure artistic expression.  I'm hoping to find some cryptic meaning in future viewings of this wacked out picture.  It'll be fun trying, unless I go crazy in the process.
B000MS1XXI|1.0|i was amazed that you could take such an innovative TV show from the 80's and make it into such a boring movie. Action was slow and predictable. Casting was horrible.

B000I2J76I|4.0|The topical plot of Lethal Weapon 2 may seem a little dated now, but Soud Av-ree-gan villains are always despicable and who doesn't love to them get blown away.<br /><br />In this second installment in the LW series, Riggs and Murtaugh babysit FBI witness Leo Getz (a wimpy, eager to be friends Joe Pesci), much to their displeasure. Stuck with nothing much to do, they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want. Riggs also takes a fancy to their secretary Rika (Patsy Kensit), but obviously their romance isn't going to last. She might as well have a death-clock counting down on her forehead.<br /><br />Richard Donner seems more involved in making LW2 a better film than the original. This time he shoots in Panavision (why he didn't do this first time around I don't know), allows more time for character development and tries hard to make a political message out of the South African Apartheid situation. Even in his previous film Scrooged, which came out a year earlier, he had anti-apartheid messages. And, if you're really sad like me, you'll notice that Riggs and Rika bang their heads together when they first meet in the exact same way that Frank Cross and Claire Phillips do in Scrooged. And his then pro-NRA posters are still hanging around in the background. Donner later reversed his opinion on this organisation.<br /><br />I always felt that the original Lethal Weapon was far too plain and straight-forward. It lacked spark in every way, but LW2 introduces more characters, has more sophisticated action and a better plot. Michael Kamen however pretty much cuts and pastes his score from the first and even rips-off his own Die Hard score in a couple of cues. This got worse in LW3.<br /><br />The ending could have killed the series off had Riggs died, which is what Shane Black originally intended. We would have been spared the awful LW3 had this been so. But instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times. A nice touch having Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" playing over his potential last moments alive though.<br /><br />After this the series became too comical and diluted. They SHOULD have killed him.<br /><br />The HD-DVD shines with a beautiful 2.4:1 1080p image and has pretty damn good Dolby Digital+ sound. Extras are minimal I'm afraid. But still well worth the money.instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times.

B000026258|4.0|As a fan of modern-classical music I've often considered the minimalism of Steve Reich to be a disappointing path. I'd much rather listen to the complexity-in-cosmic-unity of Per Norgard, the frenetic textures of Magnus Lindberg or Pierre Boulez, or the zahlenmystik in the unabashedly Orthodox music of Sofia Gubaidulina. Yet, I'm also an occasional listener of progressive house music, and viewed from this perspective MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS is a interesting work indeed.<br /><br />The hour-long work was written in 1976, and was the final statement in a musical line Reich had been following for nearly a decade. This is music as a process, where 11 chords are introduced at the beginning, and then each is slowly explored in turn over the piece. Yet, this is far from dry or boring, though it could certainly be called repetitive. For me, the piece is remarkable for sounding like the intelligent dance music which reached maturity two decades later. The steady tempo of the word makes it danceable. The eerie vocal writing and peculiar instrumental effects look forward to the exploitation of electronics. And each of the eleven sections is about as long as, and fades out similarly to a track in a house set.<br /><br />There's little chance that most house producers have heard this work, but the idea of inducing an enchanting hypnotic effect through repetition and a hi-end and bass double hit could understandably have come to different people independently. Nonetheless, if you're a fan of late 90s/early 2000s progressive house, the sort pitched by Anthony Pappa, John Digweed, and Danny Howells at the time, I'd recommend MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS for the mere pleasure of hearing these effects coming live from an acoustic ensemble.<br /><br />For that other crowd, fans of new music, a better introduction to Steve Reich might be the [[ASIN:B000066I9C Variations]] disc in Deutsche Grammophon's \\"Echo 20/21\\" series, which contains three works and gives a larger view of his early pieces (I found the DG \\"Echo 20/21\\" disc [[ASIN:B0000D7Z63 Drumming]] disc disappointing, however). Still, MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS is an entertaining work, and might be worth a listen./21\\" disc [[ASIN:B0000D7Z63 Drumming]] disc disappointing, however).

B000LPS47U|3.0|Re-Animator is so ludicris that it's kind of like watching an accident and you can't look away and you are not helping either.  The theme is campy, the story is pure dribble but the actress is gourgous the special effects are gross and let's face it this movie was not made looking for an academy award.  Tell me this, when was the last time you saw a guy holding his own detached head and talking to himself and assulting the love intrest of the story.  Oh and by the way the 1.5 stars was for the actress.  I waited a long time to get this on DVD and jumped at the chance to add it to my collection.  I know I'm not saying much about the character development or the nature of the plot, but you have to have those things in order to develop them.  No, this is just the perfect crazy late night 3:00 AM movie that Elvira would show and wise-crack throughout the entire viewing.  Not being anywhere close to 18 years of age anymore I still enjoy the nutty & the absurd from time to time.  Oh there is one hilarous scene where a reanimated black cat takes his anger and frustration out on the \\"mad doctor\\" that has reanimated it and after killing the poor kitty for the second time reanimates the poor thing again.  This movie is not for everyone, it's a minor twist on the \\"living dead\\" theme with Tony Todd, but I enjoy the utter lack of good taste and imagination from time to time.
0385474547|4.0|This is one of the better books on African people, customs and rites I've read in a while.  I did not enjoy the way women were treated, but it seems an honest portrayal.  It is sad how the \\"missionaries\\" changed most of what Okonkwo believed in and worked all his life for.  The plot, with the seven year exile, was a great element to show change to the village, physically, emotionally and spiritually.  I thought the end was not really in line with Okonkwo' character of being a great warrier ... but I suppose dying the way he did was to show how far things had gone, that even a great warrior had given up.  Well written, interesting and a quick read.

I'm glad I did not.  This really is a remarkable story of survival.  Every page you read you are floored that this man lived to tell this story.  More, he is one of the thousands of children this has happened to.  If this book doesn't make you thankful for the freedoms you have, nothing will.  When you think of the fact that he woke up one day, walked to a dance contest and subsequently lost everything dear to him ... He's a remarkable person and it's a story well worth reading; and hopefully, it will prompt world change for the kids affected by war and forced to become government soldiers when their lives have been destroyed and they have nowhere else to turn.

I'm sad that it's ending!  <br /> <br />I only have one question, and it may be a stupid one: Why are the dvds narrated by Attenborough, while the show here in the States was narrarated by Sigourney Weaver. Sigourney does an EXCELLENT job, for those of you who might not have seen this most recent version. I'm just wondering what the difference might be between the two, or if there are any other differences.
1582701709|4.0|This is a book about achieving your dreams. In order to really make this book work you have to believe in the power of thought. You imagine it, you plan it and it happens. If you have the right mind set it will happen it's the \\"law of attraction\\" It's the thought process of recognizing you own personal empowerment and what you needs to examine with in yourself to realize your full potential wether it be personal or financial gain. On the other hand if you believe disaster will happen it will because you brought it on with negative thought. This is called in the book living by deliberate creation.<br /><br />The Law of Attraction is  associated with New Thought theories. It states that one should never dwell on the negative, as the \\"metaphysical principle of life is embodied in a \\"law of attraction\\" that states \\"you get what you think about; your thoughts determine your destiny. It is also said that emotions are the factor that increase or decrease the speed of attraction relative to how much you feel about the subject you are attempting to attract.<br /><br />The book is filled with short thoughts written by doctors, lawyers and the like, all fairly charismatic people I'm sure.  Because it is this way at times it can be difficult to read. I had to read one passage think about it and go on to the next because the thought process of different writers on the same subject isn't always a clear match with the writer before or after. This isn't a knock on the book for me I had to stop after every paragraph to examine what was written.<br /><br />In someways it reminds me of a book written back in the fifties by Norman Vincent Peale called The power of positive thinking but with out the religious undertones of Peales book.<br /><br />You really have to buy in to the thought that if you can believe something you can make it happen. While this book is an interesting read and there are some stimulating quotes I dont think that the ideas presented in this book are practicle for me, but still an interesting read.read.
B00005JPMX|5.0|Animation in the US has long been considered kid's fare.  This standard applies even more to computer animation.  Back in the glory days of Disney and Bluth studios, animated movies were something that adults didn't mind viewing with their kids.  Now, computer animated films are something to keep the tykes glued to the screen while parents take a break. <br /> <br />Of course, this viewpoint is naive, and other countries such as Japan have long proven that animation is both an art form and a compelling medium for mature entertainment.  The same proves true for computer animation.  While the first Final Fantasy film (the only one to come to US theaters) was lacking in plot, both Final Fantasy films have stunning near-photorealistic visuals that scream \\"art\\". <br /> <br />Previously, the only hint of adult-targeted animated film in the US has been the much underrated [[ASIN:B00003CXDS Titan A.E. (Special Edition)]].  The film wasn't widely seen, though, and here we come to the present. <br /> <br />TMNT enters the scene with all of the pieces in place.  A star-studded voice cast (Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Chris Evans, Zhang Ziyi, and Laurence Fishburne to name a few), high quality animation, a largely well-written and humorous script, and some nice choreography make the film easy to recommend to anyone with the slightest fondness for the classic sewer dwellers. <br /> <br />The story, itself, may come across as outlandish but only to those that are unfamiliar with the comics.  The comics see the turtles crossing into other dimensions and battling a host of foes in addition to the iconic \\"Shredder\\".  Once you get past the fact that this isn't going to be the same \\"defeat shredder\\" set-up you've seen before, you may realize that the story is quite compelling.  Thematically, things are kept in line with the past movies, but because of the freedom computer animation provides, these themes are approached with greater dramatic strength.  I was only disappointed at how quickly things were resolved...the initial set-up promises a curse that (in my eyes) could have taken several movies to resolve.  I suppose the filmmakers can be forgiven for their awareness that half of their audience will be youngsters that don't DO two hour movies.  Still, the one flaw in the film remains that the conclusion comes too abruptly, and even the final fight seems rushed (slight spoiler: an enemy the four turtles couldn't handle earlier on is defeated in a one-on-one sequence in the finale...?) <br /> <br />Ultimately, TMNT is a good deal smarter than I expected it to be.  The mainstream nature of the film promises that a number of adults will get to see it and enjoy it- even if that only happens once it reaches dvd.  I can only hope that we will see more of the turtles in this form- and that the movie manages to change a few adult minds on the nature of computer animation.

B00001OH7P|5.0|Wow, rock n roll can be raw, catchy, dramatic, and quite sophisticated. So what is the need for new bands? Whenever people talk about Bowie they tend to speak in terms of him paving the way for a lot of today's music. Although that is true I don't think any new rock band has come close to this album. It's too painful for some people to look at the 1970's for what it truly was: the golden age of Rock N Roll, an age that younger people like myself missed out on and only live through their C.D. collection. It is much more comforting to call the 1970's the springboard for modern rock and ignore the fact that modern rock is passionless, corporate, crap.  <br /> This album is basically the essence of rock n roll. The songs are short, catchy, and upbeat. These are all qualities that most so called \\"modern rock\\" bands avoid like the plague although it is what rock music has always truly been about. Ziggy Stardust is from an era when quality was just plain expected in an album. You couldn't release an album with 10 crapped out songs and 1 decent single like today's bands (by the way music downloading and IPODs are not helping this problem).  <br /> If you love great rock music (real rock music) please do yourself a favor and buy Ziggy Stardust and give your Track Skip button a long deserved rest.  <br />
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls (1978) is a very good album on the strength of the funky Miss You, the rocking When the Whip Comes Down, Keith Richards' Before They Make Me Run, punk influenced Shattered, tougue-in-cheek country Far Away Eyes, the semi-soul ballad Beast of Burden, the respectable Respectable, and the tell-it-like-it-is attitude of Some Girls. All Rolling Stones classics, every one of them as good as any other Rolling Stones classic. Just My Imagination and Lies are just so bad they almost ruin the whole thing, and sort of block the flow of this otherwise great album. Whose idea was it cover this Temptations classic, anyway? This sounds like the band was warming up or doing a sound check, recorded it, and put it on the album. Lies is it's twin. If they had replaced those two with songs that matched the quality of the others, this could have been the best album the Rolling Stones ever recorded. As it is, I rate it a solid 4.5 stars, and recommend it, because it has some of The Stones' best songs.
B000002J1O|5.0|Anyone who thinks Invisible Touch was the zenith of Genesis' career is either unfamiliar with the Peter Gabriel era of the band or just plain cracked. This album is so ridiculously underrated that is makes me physically ill. Okay maybe that was a tad dramatic but drama is a given when it comes to Genesis. The only weak track on this album is the one sung by Phil Collins. It seems really out of place. Anyway, this is probably as ambitious and experimental as progressive rock can get and still be accessible. If you are unfamiliar with progressive rock Selling England is a good place to start.
0399230033|3.0|I keep seeing this book and reading how great it is but have never bought it.  I checked it out of the library and thought it was just okay.  There is actually limited reading in the book and parents will have to explain a lot to younger children.  Not for under 2 unless you just use it for talking about animal names.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|This is a real review, I work in Radio, and have gotten an advance copy.  This album is very much like Geddy's \\"My Favorite headache\\" combined with \\"Vapor Trails\\". <br /> <br />For some of you, that sounds like a good combo.  It's not.  The album wanders all over the place, never picking up steam.  The lyrics are very, very negative (\\"I don't have faith in faith\\").   <br /> <br />The first single, Far Cry is a terrific song to start the album with.  Enjoy the song, because that type of energy doesn't re-appear at all here.  If you enjoy instrumentals, this album may be for you.  It features 3 (THREE!), and one of them is just Alex Lifeson (solo). <br /> <br />I am a long time Rush fan, and was hoping this album was a return to form.  It's not.  The songs are disjointed, plodding, and soft.  Please don't read this review and assume I only like the old albums.  Some of my favorites are Test for Echo, Presto, and Counterparts. <br /> <br /> <br />Not my idea of Rush.  Better luck next time, guys.
0743496728|3.0|If you like this type of thing (thrillers, high school shootings) I much prefer Picoult's The Pact: A Love Story [[ASIN:0061150142 The Pact: A Love Story]] Here, Picoult examines teenage suicide, with mixed results, in her fifth novel. Chris Harte and Em Gold's parents have been next-door neighbors and best friends for 18 years. When Chris and Em fall in love, everyone is thrilled. Everyone, it turns out, except for Em, who finds that sex with Chris feels almost incestuous. Her emotional turmoil, compounded by pregnancy, which she keeps secret, leads to depression, despair and a desire for suicide, and she insists that Chris prove his love by pulling the trigger. The gun is fired in the first paragraph, and so the book opens with a jolt of adrenaline. I feel that you get to know the characters much better in \\"The Pact\\" than this book.
B00007LTIA|5.0|From the number of reviews here, it's obviously a sort of \\"rite of passage\\" for many prog reviewers to put in their two cents on this album, and it's high time for me to add mine too.  For some 30-odd years now, I've  revered TFTO as one of my TOP FIVE albums of all time, and I'll try to explain my reasoning for that here.<br /><br />First, if you never bought into the basic concept and scope of the album, you probably never had the patience to sit through this very demanding (and some say excessive) music long enough to experience its true beauty, and surely nothing I say here will convince you to try it again.  Yet I'm still astounded that some self-proclaimed prog heads never realized that this was probably THE MOST progressive album of its time (keep in mind, this was 1973!)  -  for just how long did you expect this talented quintet to remain content to simply rehash their established (though successful) musical style on new studio releases?<br /><br />Second, you have to understand that Yes got their positive vibe and harmonies from 60's flower power, hippie, folk-rock (listen to their debut album, a mere four years earlier)  -  but they electrified it, and played it in an angular fashion using odd time signatures, following the influence of 20th century classical music on their compositional style.  That influence manifested itself in the way they wrote longer suites of music (numbered almost as if they were short concertos or symphonies).  Think \\"Starship Trooper\\", \\"And You And I\\", and of course \\"Close To The Edge\\".  Was it really that much of a stretch for us to see them attempt to expand this form to the max on the very symphonic \\"Tales\\"?<br /><br />This is a magical, beautiful, sophisticated album performed as only the virtuosos of Yes could play.  O.K., there are admittedly moments of excess (e.g. parts of \\"The Ancient\\"); and the fact that each \\"song\\" or movement occupies a full vinyl album side smacks somewhat of artificial structuring.  But there is just so much excellent songwriting here too, and I challenge any veteran listener of this album to deny remembering some great lyrics or melodic hooks.  (I can probably hum the whole album for you from start to finish, including the great solos!)  And one certainly can't refute the mysticism and abstract optimism of the lyrics, which typically include a lot of word-painting and poetry as well.  The lyrics are augmented by some of the best three-part vocal harmonies the band has ever done.  (Listen to \\"Ritual\\".)<br /><br />Excellent debut for Alan White on drums (which really sound great on this remastered version).  Incredible guitar layering and solos by my favorite guitarist.  (\\"Go get 'em, Steven!\\")  Lots of piano and lush synth and mellotron washes from Wakeman add a dreamy coloring to much of the music.  Squire's bass may be toned down a bit in the mix, but he's endlessly inventive on this album, and his solos comprise some of the album highlights for me personally.<br /><br />When all is said and done, it doesn't really matter if you feel as I do about this album  -  it was undeniably controversial, even within the band!  So it's no surprise that this album just won't succeed with some listeners (though I do object to those reviewers who join in on the lynching simply because it feels good to find fault with these seemingly \\"arrogant and pretentious\\" innovators of music).  Even I am not above admitting that there were some subsequent Yes albums that really missed the mark for me too.  (Open Your Eyes indeed!)<br /><br />This was an ambitious undertaking by Anderson and Howe, and perhaps too spiritual, deep and cerebral for the halfhearted prog fan.  (There is no humor to be found here.)  But for the ardent fan of thoughtful, serious, meaningful, uplifting and emotional progressive rock played with unparalleled virtuosity, TFTO was a virtual masterpiece in its genre, and the uniquely inspirational magnum opus from a truly progressive band that was in its prime andseeking perfection.<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 9/10;  Performance = 9.5/10;  Production = 9.5/10;  CD length = 10/10.<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.3  (\\"5 stars\\")ing music that is played and recorded well.

B00004YKUY|5.0|Love this album. It is a return to the Journey sound at the height of their fame in the Escape/Frontiers days. Steve Augeri sounds very much like Perry - enough so that Perry isn't missed at all. Augeri delivers the vocals with as much passion. Unlike Trial by Fire, all the songs are solid and are well-crafted. <br />Higher Place - a great melody. <br />All the Way - another great tune that has a great chorus. <br />Signs of Life - the hits don't stop here. <br />All the Things - Solid songwriting, guitar riffs reminiscent of Who's Crying Now. <br />Loved by you - Nice slow song yet not sappy. Very listenable. <br />Livin' to do - wonderful bluesy tune. <br />World gone wild - catchy upbeat song. <br />I got a reason - yet another great song. <br />With your love - a sweet slow love song. <br />Lifetime of Dreams - lovely melancholy song. <br />live and breath - a soft rock song. <br />nothin' comes close - a rocking song to pick up the pace. <br />to be alive again - another upbeat tune.  <br />Kiss me softly - back to slow soft rock - nice to hear the vocal start off in a low range instead of constantly reaching for the high notes. I've often wished to hear Perry sing a bit reserved for one or two songs but he always sang at a high intensity for every song. Loved the slow guitar notes. Wish Journey would experiment with more Spanish guitar sounds like this song. <br />We will meet again - The album closes with a strong song and great songwriting. <br />Too bad the record company didn't promote this album because it would have been a great hit. Journey has always been true artists in my mind - writing, composing their own original music instead of relying on produced covers of other people's songs. This album won't disappoint Journey/Perry fans. Even I was huge fan of Perry back in the day but this album proves that even the lead vocalist is replaceable. Too bad they waited so long to come up with this stellar lineup of bandmembers.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Excellent kick-off season for the best Star Trek Series! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the first episode, and how Commander Sisko has to explain linear time to non-linear beings, who end up being, in the later seasons, his mother. Kira needs to learn how to persuade Cardassians to leave, though. They got mad her because  they thought she had destroyed one of their ships. Instead of convincing them that they were right, and saying that she would do the same to them, too, she tried to convince them that there was a wormhole right where they had spent the past 50 years, which was the truth.<br />~Trekkie~

B000MXPE7O|5.0|This movie is definately a thinking person's movie.  The action is in the thoughts it provokes and trying to figure out whose side the characters are really on.  If you like this sort of movie, I highly recommend this.  If you want action or a movie that simply entertains you, pass on it.
0385338694|3.0|this book is ok with some great moments. towards the end, there's a great scene with the heroine serving dinner with a coworker from her law firm.<br /><br />its a fun read, though, and i recommend it to someone with some time to kill, maybe on a plane (where i read it).
B000NA28I4|4.0|Okay, grumpy naysayers, I know you read the book first, and no sin seems greater than a movie not following the book, but taken on its own, this movie worked.  I scoured these reviews to see if I could show it to my 3 and 4 year old, and finally found my answer--a reviewer with 10 (!) kids, recommended it for children, and sure enough, my two loved it.  I had to do some narrating, but it was fun to see a timeless story made fresh in their eyes.  I would so much rather watch this with my kids than something lurid and garish like Jim Carey's Grinch.  There were some scary visuals, definately, so sensitive kids may be frightened, and I made sure not to show it right before bed, but my kids were asking to see it again the next day.
B00006AW2G|1.0|We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way. <br /> <br />However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM). <br /> <br />I don't know who to blame for my \\"mistake\\" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO? <br /> <br />I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding \\"DSD-\\" or \\"SACD-\\" labeled items. <br /> <br />I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I bought this movie because of the \\"Name\\" Stars - They could have filmed their parts in 2 days and all Cate Blanchett had to do was lye still - no acting required. Brad Pitt's  yelling obscenities at the police and turning his back and running away was the only acting necessary. This movie is decidedly against men  - moreover it has no substantiating connectivity. For example - segments end in one type of terrain and startup again in another very hospitable type of terrain solely to play on one's political 'mind' and to further the 'idea' all men are rotten.
B000059TPN|5.0|It is the age old question.  The first time I ever saw this on a friend's DVD shelf, I though that it must be some old 1930s noir movie titled \\"The Rock\\", but no, it was Michael Bay's action movie. <br /> <br />And I love me some Criterion collection, though I have to wonder why they put out The Rock and yet have long neglected Orson Welles' films. <br /> <br />In any case, the reason this movie deserves Criterion status is that it's probably one of the best action movies ever made.  If you are looking for slam-bang, hammy acting, bullets everywhere, bad puns, buddy-cop drama, pseudo-governmental double-crossing, well, this is about as good as it gets.  Whether or not it's you cup of tea is a different issue.  But you just have to read Ebert's review to see why this movie is so damn good. <br /> <br />So buy it, put on your best surround, get an HDTV and watch the flashy explosions.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I have absolutely no problem viewing this gem on my XBOX 360 HD DVD player. Do not miss this one. It is perfect. 6 Stars out of 5.
B00005JPCF|1.0|What a disaster. Stay away from this film. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is the first (and so far only) children's movie that my four-year-old has not liked. In fact, he hated it.     The story is rambling and confused. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. For example, those all-important \\"happy feet\\" of the main character? They just kind of jerk and slide around a bit, not even in time to the music. That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be animation? I've seen better stuff in 1960's-era Warner Bros. cartoons.     The jokes aren't funny, and much of the \\"humor\\" is based on offensive stereotyping (\\"oh those funny, lazy Mexicans!\\") and/or age-inappropriate sexual innuendo. There's not a single original song, and the remakes of classic songs are frankly terrible.    Perhaps most annoying for adult viewers is the heavy-handed, cliched, and just plain stupid political message the film attempts to deliver. The ending is especially unbearable, with its absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. Whatever your politics, the message of the film just doesn't make any sense. Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided, incoherent, oversimplified message offended me greatly.    BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE.  Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, the sexual jokes are age-inappropriate. There are also some terrifying portrayals of some \\"bad\\" sea animals (killer whales, and a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion that for some reason is made to roar like a dinosaur and has giant teeth set in a hideously deformed mouth), scenes that are far too scary for young children. (And what's the message supposed to be, anyway? Orcas = bad, penguins = good?It's okay to kill whales and sea lions, but we should protect penguins? because they TAP DANCE???)     Topping it off, the film has an absolutely weird and jarring ending: it suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, \\"This is not a movie for me.\\"  I couldn't agree more.    Probably the most unoriginal, stupid piece of filmmaking I've seen in 10 years. Maybe ever. By far the worst \\"kids' movie\\" I can think of.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|Avril Lavigne burst onto the scene in a big way in 2002. Her single Complicated was a smash hit, and one of the biggest songs of that year. Her unique style also helped her stand out from the crowd. She strayed from the pop on her debut album and went the serious route for her sophomore release. With a three year gap in-between releases, what direction would Avril's music go in this time?<br /><br />Shifting tones once again, Avril has abandoned the serious tone of her previous album, and has returned to the more lightweight pop of her debut, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your own point of view. She definitely sounds like she's having fun, as she shows by cursing up a storm throughout the album. Of course, this means the songs aren't anywhere near as deep (relatively speaking) as her previous album, but if that's not what you're into, then you should enjoy listening to this album, as she has returned to being the brat that doesn't have to listen to anyone that she was on her first album. Some of the highlights on the album are Girlfriend, I Can do Better, and the title track.<br /><br />Overall, your own enjoyment of this album will depend on which Avril you prefer. If you liked her previous album, then the tone of this one will probably disappoint you. However, if you liked her debut album, then this one will be a welcome return to form to the Avril you've grown to love.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Stellar performances throughout, this movie really makes you wonder...possibly my favorite movie!
B00005JPPI|3.0|As the story opens, wealthy Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) discovers his wife is having an affair and promptly shoots her.  Enter the police, led by a detective who just happens to be Mrs. Crawford's lover.  Crawford  confesses to the shooting and it looks like an open and shut case, or so thinks ambitious, young Deputy District Attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling).  He agrees to take the case assuming it will be 1-2-3-guilty, but Crawford pleads not guilty, wants to defend himself, and, oh yes, where's the gun?<br /><br />This movie is beautifully photographed in film noir shadows and dim lighting and looks great.  The problem is the script that calls for such unremittingly monotonous and deadpan performances that when it's over, it's just an overwhelming downer.  I didn't care about any of the characters and was disappointed that the wonderful Anthony Hopkins had so little screen time.  It's all about Ryan Gosling's cocky, social-climbing character.  Both Gosling and Hopkins go through the whole movie with poker-faces and the I'm-so-much-smarter-than-you act wears thin early on.  In place of intense emotions, we get a subdued face-off between two smug equal adversaries (neither of whom is likeable) and even a brief office romance is played down and devoid of warmth.  It's an OK movie that held my interest, but left me wishing there were more emotional sparks on the screen.
B000OCXF0Q|1.0|I bought this CD for my teenage daughter and didn't see the parental warning because it was covered up by the \\"Special Edition\\" sticker. Thank goodness I listened to it first! I usually end up liking some of the songs on my daughter's CDs because I end up listening to them all the time, but this CD is totally WORTHLESS. Even if you remove the profanity - which is totally pointless to begin with because it adds nothing to the music - the only thing left is a bunch of cheerleader music....and that's not what people have come to expect from Avril Lavigne. My daughter was eagerly anticipating the release of this CD and she is really disappointed. Shame on you Avril for cashing in on your name and releasing TRASH! <br />

1904233023|5.0|Ender's Game is quite possibly the quintessential Sci-Fi novel. It's one of the best around with some truly unique settings and characters. For any fan of science fiction, this is a must read, and was one of the inspirations for my own novel [[ASIN:1590923286 The Elder Worlds: Book One]].<br /><br />I first read Ender's Game in high school, around the time I tackled my first novel, which went through many revisions since those days. Ender's Game was one of those books that was hard to put down, and played out almost like a movie. The writing style of Card makes it easy to visualize the characters while still allowing for individual interpretations.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The production value of the series is astronomical. The amount of time and effort spent filming it is almost immeasurable. The best part is, you can see each and every bit of this quality when you watch it. They don't waste a single second of footage or a single inch of screen-space. It's the most comprehensive, enjoyable, and breathtaking documentary that I have ever seen of any type, much less among those that focus on nature. It completely changes what one expects from a nature documentary. I can honestly say I've never felt more connected to this tiny but impressive rock that we call home. It really opens your eyes and moves you somewhere deep down in your soul.<br /><br />The fantastic shots from space. The high-speed camera (slow motion, with amazing clarity and detail) shots of dozens of interesting scenes of all types. Wide-angle shots of hundreds of thousands of birds and insects leaping into the air at the same time. Close-in shots of the smallest of animals in the forests of South America. When you watch, for the first time ever filmed or even seen by man, a snow leopard bounding down the side of mountain chasing a goat in HD, you'll know why the cameraman who captured it had tears in his eyes.<br /><br />If you have ever had a moment watching a nature documentary (or really any documentary) where you thought, \\"whoa, that was kinda cool,\\" get this series. It doesn't matter which of the two HD formats you have or which of the two you want (if you have the equipment to display HD material). Get Planet Earth. Sit down. Press Play.

Though I will say that if you've been looking for a reason to upgrade to HD, this is it.
B000J103PC|4.0|The Devil Wears Pravda is a pretty good movie though the terms \\"cliched\\" and \\"predictable\\" are pretty apt.  The acting is quite good and Meryl Streep is absolutely perfect for her role as the consumed business woman whose ambitious dream has become nightmare for herself as well all who fall under her rule.<br /><br />There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie, mostly by Stanley Tucci's character.  His ascerbic wit and resigned nobility under fire is, perhaps, the best character study in the whole work.  Without revealing too much for those who may not have seen it, his short speech when he receives the worst disappointment of his life, is absolutely superb, both in delivery and content.  It sums up the whole relationship that a person has to have in order to work with, live with and be consumed by, a high achieving, powerful creature such as Miranda Priestly (Streep).  For all those who contemplate the world of power and recognition, whatever the industry, note well  from Tucci what such life entails.<br /><br />There were a couple of things in the movie which causes one to chuckle about things that the director probably didn't intend.<br /><br />First - there is the hilarious idea that Hathaway, dressed in school girl kitsch, is somehow supposed to be seen as plain.  The woman walks into the office for her intial job interview and is promptly laughed to scorn by women wearing very expensive clothes that seem inspired by a Salvation Army window display.  Hathaway glows no matter what she is wearing and it was truly hilarious watching the director attempt to convey her as somehow less glamorous than those laughing at her.  It was necessary to the plot but in order to tell a story about an ugly duckling turning into a swan, you have to start with an ugly duckling.<br /><br />Second - there is the scene where Streep proceeds to flay Hathaway alive for snickering when a fashion decision between two nearly identical belts is being made.  Streep proceeds to enlighten Hathaway about the true vocation of Designer clothing.  She talks of art, of how the decisions that are made trickle down into the lives of the masses, how the world is somehow made a more beautiful place, how children are nurtured, how truth is advanced, how love is fostered (OK, so I'm embellishing a bit), etc. etc.  In another generation of movies, it was the kind of scene where heavenly music would start playing in the back ground.  Her purpose was to raise Hathaway's conscience by revealing that the fashion industry is NOT all about elitism, about faddish manufacturing of taste, about culturaly snobbishness, about insider cutural incest.  Yeah, right.  See, point one above.<br /><br />Third - there is the scene where the earnest and concerned father travels to see his daughter because he is worried about how this new job is consuming his daughter.  She is never home.  She is running around too much chasing after the whims of her boss.  She is not taking time for herself.  Etc. etc. etc.  In a gesture of love and compassion he gives her some money because he is afraid she is not making the rent.  In all of this, there is not one single concern raised over the fact that the woman is living with her boyfriend in the apartment whose rent needs paying.  Post-modern ethics do not triumph in this movie, they are never questioned.  When Hathaway awakens after a one-night fling it is passed over and forgotten, a mere burp in the digestion of bigger portions.  Sex is incidental, being true to one's self, to one's friends, to the inner nobility which one must be concerned to preserve and nuture and promote, is the message of the movie.<br /><br /> \\"To thine own self be true\\" , Polonius advises Laertes, but Shakespeare had an idea that being true had some meaning other than personal inclination, else Hamlet would not have been plagued by his conscience.  In this movie, the message about being true to one's own self, is far less morally instructive.  Miranda Priestly (Streep) perhaps gives us better insight into its true nature.  She is \\"true to herself\\" to a fault, sacrificing time with her charming twin children (a bit of an anomaly here), ruining her marriages, and sitting, alone, without makeup, wearing a common bathrobe, in an expensive hotel room in Paris.  Yet as she reviews the cost, rehearsing it as a means of revealing the essential humanity that lies beneath her hard-bitten exterior, she arrives at the inevitable conclusion.  It is worth it.  This is her life.  What ever price she has to pay or whatever price she requires other to pay, so that she may be Miranda Priestly, it is worth it.<br /><br />With no external standards to guide us, the inevitable progression of human pride will direct our steps, large or small, down this path.  The Devil Wears Pravada is a fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood  walks in the dark forest of the Fashion Industry and is saved from the wolf that seeks to gobble her up.  But  one has to wonder, based on how the movie ends, if the salvation she receives, is just at the hand of another wolf in different clothing.iranda Priestly (Streep) perhaps gives us better insight into its true nature.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Albuquerque homemaker Sheryl (Toni Collette) has a few problems, causing her some stress, leading to nicotine addiction. (\\"I am NOT smoking!\\")<br /><br />First, there is Richard (Greg Kinnear) her husband, who is an annoying and uninspired motivation speaker who thinks he's going to get rich hustling his nine-step pyramid to success.  Loser!<br /><br />Then there is her brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has bandages on his wrists after trying to kill himself because his homosexual lover (one of his grad students) dumped him, the number one American authority on Marcel Proust, for his academic rival, the number two authority.  Pathetic!<br /><br />Next there is Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a randy nursing home reject who snorts heroin, has a potty mouth and complains a lot.  (Maybe he'll overdose!)<br /><br />Then there is her teenaged son Dwayne (Paul Dano) an antisocial loner who reads Nietzsche, hates everyone, and is on a vow of silence until he gets into flight training in the Air Force.  (Our children always disappoint us.  Sometimes we forgive them.)<br /><br />And finally there is Miss Sunshine herself, her daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) a little overweight, a little nerdy, not exactly a looker, who has entered the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for little girls and is honing her dance routine following the pornographic advice of Grandpa.  Oh, boy!<br /><br />Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land.  For reasons too complex to relate, the whole family piles into the Volkswagen bus and heads for Redondo Beach, California where the beauty pageant is being held.  Along the madcap way, the bus's clutch goes out, Grandpa suffers, shall we say, a major setback, Richard learns that the family finances are not going to work out, Frank gets the heartbreak rubbed in his face, and Dwayne finds out that his dream is not going to come true.  But can Olive win the pageant?<br /><br />The pageant itself is pretty funny with the girls in their plastic hairdos and their Tammy Faye makeup and their fake smiles pitted against the decidedly unglamourous but ever hopeful Olive Hoover.  Who will win?<br /><br />Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations.  But see this for the writer.  Michael Arndt's warm, funny and highly original script has me (and half the screenwriters in Hollywood and New York) green with envy.is dream is not going to come true.

B00005JPCF|5.0|I read over some of the other people's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it.  My kids ages 6 & 2 loved this movie from start to finish.  The music, the characters, and the story were great for the entire family.  I definitely recommend this movie for your family's movie collection.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Porcupine Tree are simply a amazing band. They have a unique sound and are a band that continues to evolve and produce new refreshing music that is still 100% Porcupine Tree. In this regard \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" does not disapoint. I've been listening to this album for almost a week now and I have to say it ranks up there with some of the best music they have made. The last two PT albums, In Absentia and Deadwing were monumental albums for and they adopted a harder riff based sound than they had previously. Excellent albums as everyone knows. FOABP certainly continues this trend, but at the same time some of the songs almost remind me of the Lightbulb Sun/Stupid Dream era. My Ashes & Sentimental are examples of this. Any PT fan knows that those two albums are fantastic. The new album is a perfect combination of all the different sounds that make PT great. This album really sums up what makes PT great and reminds me of all the great music that they have made over the years. Whatever PT era fan you are, there is something you can appreciate on this album.<br /><br />This album certainly ranks up there with their best work. Is it Porcupine Tree's best album? I don't know, but a argument could be made for that, and I'm sure that many PT fans will view this album as their best work yet. Bottom line is that if your a PT fan, you'll love this album. If your new to Porcupine Tree, this is as good of place to start as any. Porcupine Tree is a special band, they truly are. Fear of a Blank Planet is shining example to how great they are. Everything about this album, from the lyrics, to the song structure to the mellodies is almost perfect. It never gets stale, never feels like old or played out. One thing that Porcupine Tree does amazingly well is make complete albums. The flow and continuity of all their albums is great, and Fear of a Blank Planet is no different.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think music gets much better than this. I had high expectations for this album and it exceeded them. The title track, Fear of a Blank Planet is on par with some of the best songs they have ever done. Its very addicting and its hard, which is good. The song which most people will probably be talking about though, is the 17 minute epic \\"Anesthetize.\\" Every PT song that I've heard ranking in over 10 minutes is truly incredible. This song is no different. It ranks up there with \\"Russia on Ice\\" and \\"Arriving Somewhere.\\" Fantastic song that just blows by when your listening too it.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I think this album is here to stay. I've already listened to it quite a bit and its still sounding amazing. Add this album to your collection, its one of 2007's best albums. I look forward to what else Porcupine Tree will be bringing us in the coming years.em. The title track, Fear of a Blank Planet is on par with some of the best songs they have ever done.

B000FS9FC6|4.0|Insulting to a viewer's intelligence, I mean.   <br /> <br />At a few times throughout this movie, I just had to roll my eyes and wonder if it was really necessary to hit us over the head with the metaphorical sledgehammer.  Yes, I see the references to 1984, Hitler, and all the rest.  Yes, I see the cracks at Bush,etc, etc, etc.  However, despite the occasional (somewhat self-satisfied) sigh, I did enjoy the Shakespeare quotes, the camera work, and the film itself.   <br /> <br />What did rankle a bit, though is that at the end, I was not cheering for V as much as I felt the film should have made me.  Despite their attempts to use what happened to him to forgive everything and anything, I agree with Evey that they created a monster.  Or, maybe, I just didn't want anything as gorgeous as the Parliament building in London to be blown up.  I hear that the original graphic novel kept the ambiguity of the characters.  That would have been good.  As is, I can't help but sympathize with V, though I can't condone his actions, either.
B00005JPP6|4.0|Having never seen 2004's [[ASIN:B000B2YR8I Shaun of the Dead]], I didn't know what to expect from director/co-screenwriter Edgar Wright's latest movie, which plays out like an Ealing Studios only-in-Britain comedy amplified on Tarantino-level steroids. The 2007 action farce achieves the impressive feat of being silly and smart, quite often at the same time, as Wright and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pegg show themselves to be cineastes with a sharp eye and nimble ear for satire. There are lots of derivative plot turns to track in this fish-out-of-water story, which shifts into a blazing, gun-toting thriller as a tribute to testosterone-driven, Jerry Bruckheimer-genre buddy movies like [[ASIN:B00005A3KS Point Break]] and [[ASIN:B0002J4X34 Bad Boys II]]. Even the intentionally exploitative title fits the tone of this eminently enjoyable popcorn flick perfectly.<br /><br />With laser-sharp precision, Pegg stars as a straight-arrow aptly named Nicholas Angel, inarguably the best police officer in London. However, he is so good that he makes the rest of the force look ineffectual, which leads to his unceremonious transfer to a sleepy hamlet named Sandford. There he carries his duties quite seriously, which naturally puts him at odds with the casual townsfolk. But then a suspicious car accident occurs, and the plot escalates into a wild ride of contrived but often hilarious developments leading to an ambitious, cartoon-like series of exciting finales. Angel naturally needs a partner to succeed, and Nick Frost (looking a lot like Mark Addy from [[ASIN:6305622914 The Full Monty]]) winningly plays schlubby Danny, a wannabe action hero who happens to be the devoted son of Frank Butterman, the village police chief. Together they uncover a plot that upends the entire community.<br /><br />There are lots of familiar faces in funny supporting turns - Timothy Dalton at his smarmy best (and looking well poised to inherit Christopher Plummer's villain roles) as the suspicious supermarket owner; Jim Broadbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask. The one-liners are funny enough, but what really resonate are the subtle, often throwaway shots that make fun of American movie conventions. Even though the film runs for over two hours, Wright and Pegg have paced the story with a dexterous mix of thrills, intelligence and laughs. Much of this successful hat trick is due to Chris Dickens' propulsive editing and a nifty combination of over-the-top stunts and visual effects. This film is quite an unexpected kick.adbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The winner of the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH makes an extremely concise and persuasive case regarding one of the great issues in the history of the human race.  That issue is global warming, and the largely uncontested fact that the billions of people on this planet are doing serious damage to their home by causing it.    Filmed by noted TV director Davis Guggenheim, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH spotlights the crusade taken on by former Vice-President Al Gore to make the issue of global warming THE paramount issue of our time.  And given all that we've seen firsthand around the world (droughts in Africa; the melting of glaciers; the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina; and dozens of U.S. cities breaking all-time heat records during the summer of 2005), there is very little doubt that unchecked human activity is the culprit.  Gore himself reflects on how his time in public office and his many decades of studying this problem forced him into action, and how so many of his colleagues in Washington, most of them beholden to Big Oil, were so blithely brushing off global warming as \\"the biggest hoax ever perpetrated.\\"  But the facts he shows us in his PowerPoint presentations, plus first-hand evidence in those parts of the world hardest hit by the dramatic climate changes that global warming has wrought so far are extremely difficult to ignore.    Often thought of as stiff while a politician, Gore is now something of a modern-day sage (except, of course, to those on the political and corporate far-right, who still view him as a threat),  With Mr, Guggenheim's help, he makes the case for solving global warming very clear in AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.  The means to combat this problem are in our hands right now--it only requires the will to make them happen.  And all the complaints that automakers and big corporations make about how such changes will negatively impact the economy are soundly debunked here.    In a time where there have been numerous documentary films that have made a huge commercial, cinematic, and emotional impact, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH makes its case particularly clear: We humans need to change the way we live, so that fifty or a hundred years from now, we're not faced with a global crisis that may never be solved.  And on that level, it's a masterpiece of its kind.
B000O178BY|5.0|I am a huge NIN fan. I love everything they have done, from \\"The Downward Spiral\\" to \\"Year Zero\\" (Pretty Hate Machine sounds a bit too much like a crack head did it, even though it's great) Year Zero is as Trent Reznor says \\"A sound collection\\" I personally am intrigued by the sounds Trent Reznor creates. Yes, there are lyrics, but there is alot of sounds too. I actually like that there is no slow song on this album like on his others. Don't get me wrong I love his slower songs, but they just get tired after awile. The concept of this album is very interesting. It is set in a world that is killing itself do to all the hate in it (sound familiar) All in all, this is a disc for all the old fans like myself, unlike With Teeth which was a very mainstream try by Trent Reznor.
B00004YX39|5.0|Donald Fagen and Walter Becker can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned. This final album before Steely Dan's storied 20-year hiatus is just as ultra-smooooooooth as it gets, capturing that early-80s cocaine-infused vibe pretty flawlessly. And even after they got back to work, releasing \\"Two Against Nature\\" and \\"Everything Must Go\\" in rapid succession, they were still head and shoulders above 95% of the pop trash that passes for music these days. How unfortunate that radio programmers won't give them the time of day anymore.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Actually, I'd give this CD four and a half stars.  The only thing that prevents a five-star review is that any greatest hits of someone as important as Neil Young needs  to have 2 CDs to cover all the material the man has produced over the years.  Sound quality excellent, and the versions are full-length, as much as ten minutes in the case of 'Cowgirl in the Sand'.  Neil Young was one of the seminal singer/songwriters of the sixties and early seventies, and his works capture the era of protest and baby-boomers coming of age.  The song selection is good for a single CD.  As someone who has most of Young's work on vinyl, I realize that this retrospective is only about half what deserves to be included, but it is a good start, and highly recommended.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|I've been waiting for this release, as I really liked her first two releases - but am glad I borrowed it first.  I tried to give it a chance but didn't really care for most of the songs - a major change from her first two cd's - too commercial - should sell well with the pre-teen market - those who's parents don't screen the lyrics first
B00000APLB|4.0|This live recording has some great music on it.  Especially enjoyable is the small-house set of old blues numbers.  However, all the songs are well-done, with great finesse and energy, and this is a very satisfying Rolling Stones live album.  Four and a half stars.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album was a warning shot over the bow that Layne was killing himself with heroin. The entire album is heroin influenced (some good, some bad). When Alice was \\"on,\\" they were on (on their game, spot-on, on to something...) like nobody's business. this highly underappreciated band was the third part of the Seattle triumvirate [Gods I hope I spelled that right]. With Nirvana at the head, and the boys of Pearl Jam on the right, this was the left (sinister) hand of Satan - er... heroin, I mean Seattle (sowwy). Alice in Chains came to life in the first half of their debut album, but really hit a stride here, only to finally define their art in Jar of Flies.<br /><br />The classics on this album (and you know what they are if you have heard this album or read ANY reviews of it) define who Alice were and how they affected the world around us in less overt, but no less lasting ways than their more flashy counterparts. This is not \\"happy music\\" but then when is life \\"happy\\" really?
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|I have been using the HP12C for about 20 of the 25 years it has been around.  I love the calculator, and this is why I have used it for so long.  I would recommend a purchase of an HP 12C to everyone.  I also recommend purchasing the HP 12C instead of this anniversary edition.  I only have a couple reasons for this. <br />1) The keys of the anniversary edition do not respond as well as on the regular HP 12C.  For example, when I turn on the anniversary edition, I have to check to make sure it actually turns on. <br />2) The quality of the anniversary edition is just not on par with the regular HP 12C.  For example, the screen on the anniversay edition is already getting scratched up.  I have a twenty year old and a five year old HP 12C, and neither of them has any scratches on the screen.  Also the keys are just not as solid and they don't have the nice tactile feel of the regular HP 12C.  The anniversary edition just feels cheap. <br /> <br />So I would recommend skipping the anniversary edition for the regular HP 12C.
B000KRN67C|5.0|With a name like Rotting Christ I had generally supposed that this band do little more than black metal noise. I have consequently just taken a big slap in the face by some of the best crafted, atmospheric and tuneful metal I've heard in a longtime. From the demonic (yet very listenable) vocals, the technical, busy and melodic guitars, to the delicate neo classical orchestration and choir work (including arabic sounding warbling and ancient Greek chanting), we have all the right ingredients to travel to another place and to a distant era. Beautiful, chilling, dark music to conjur up images of being chased around monastries by evil monks with only Sean Connery and and a handful of candles to save you. Needless to say, the Rotting Christ back catalogue is currently having a good seeing to by someone who has shamefully overlooked them and their monstrous talent for the last fifteen years.  <br /> <br />
0374105235|5.0|Seriously this book is excellent. Don't expect intelligent language or rich vocabulary-- but do expect an excellent story by a boy who lived the civil war in Sierra Leone. The war that stole the innocence of thousands of children and made them souless. The war that destroyed millions of lives. The war that is unfair. Like every war...
B00000DQSZ|3.0|3 1/2 <br /> <br />It's good, quite good for Kraftwerk's body of werk, of course appreciated infinitely more in it's proper context, though I always felt these rightful legends were more producers then artists. These grandfathers of electronic music indeed pioneered the euro-techno-minimalist template to an astounding degree, though they seemed, as is with many innovative musical groups, to often eclipse substance with style. What some consider their finest disc, certainly may be a solid piece of the coldly melodic kraftmenship fans have come to expect, but usually remains pretentiously detached for an unfamiliar crowd. Most of a short run time is spent on the purposely restrictive but calculatedly executed beats, melodies and vocals in an enticing enough way that makes the album a worthy visit now and again, but hardly merits frenzied devotion.
B000MKD9P6|2.0|A shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values... A waste of time.
B000002ADT|5.0|not much can be said about kind of blue that hasn't been said before - especially in all these reviews.  it is, without question, the quinesentail jazz album.  with legendary  players bill evans, paul chambers, and jimmy cobb laying down the foundation for the incomparable horns of davis, john coltrane, and cannonball adderly  its not surprising this is a masterpiece.  but there's lots of great groupings on lots of great albums in jazz, and this is by no means the first.  it is, however, one of the most seamless and tight groupings of exceptionally skilled musicians as you'll ever find.  i purchased this album at least 10 years ago and i've listened to it countless times, quite literally, and its not rare that it sends shivers up my spine to this day.  every song deserves accolades, but 'all blues' and 'freddie freeloader' are my personal favorites.  'all blues' is one of my all time favorite pieces of music, jazz or otherwise.   <br />  <br />if you like kind of blue i'd recomend: <br />somethin' else - cannonball adderly - similar grouping to kind of blue - no coltrane, and miles taking a lesser role, but very similar feel.  not perfection, but unquestionably an excellent album.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie when it hit the theaters did not begin to receive the attention it deserves. Fine acting, exceptional cinematography, great plot with a genuine surprise ending that will leave you saying to your self \\"...cool.\\" I loved this movie. It had an honest creepy side that would bring goosebumps, a story of passion and long lost love, imperial intrigue all set in Victorian era Austria/Prussia. This is the total adventure and should not be passed up. I had heard from others seeking to compare this movie to The Prestige - don't. The Prestige was an okay movie - similar in period setting, but transparent in plot. It was all too easy to figure out how it would end long before it did. The Illusionist has so much more to offer, and in my opinion is a much, much better movie when compared.<br /><br />If you enjoy fine acting (Paul Giamatti, Edward Norton and more), superb plot, surprise endings (that make sense and a true revelation!), then add a touch supernatural creepy-ness, and Victorian era settings all masterfully produced and directed, this film is true feast.<br /><br />A truley COOL film.
B0001XALTG|4.0|Mainly, this is the story of Renton, a heroin addict, and his friends Tommy, Spud, Sick Boy, and Begbie.  Renton tries more than once to rid himself of the white horse on his back, but finds that being sucked back in is easier than fighting the horse.<br /><br />This is a movie about people and personalities, not one particular event, though several of these everyday occurrences will stand out in your mind forever - Like the world's filthiest toilet that Renton is forced to use, and his toilet daydream that follows it.  There's an unforgettable scat scene with morning sheets that will be sure to turn your stomach.<br /><br />Warning:  There is a dead baby scene in this movie that will turn most stomachs and perhaps make you hate every heroin addict that ever lived.  Though nothing is ever said about it, the insinuation is that the baby died from neglect.  Before even reporting it, the mother needs a \\"hit\\" to calm her down.<br /><br />Set to a great soundtrack and filled with witty dialogue (although absolutely filled with flagrant curses) and narrative, 'Trainspotting' highlights not just the differences between \\"Us And Them\\" but the differences between the addicts themselves.  The most violent of the addicts, Begbie, never touches heroin and considers it to be filth while swilling alcohol and stabbing people.  Spud is simply confused all the time, while Tommy manages to steer clear of the horse until his girlfriend dumps him.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the addiction movie, then this is a must-see.  If you can't handle horrific scenes, such as the dead baby scene, then perhaps pass on this.  Because of its languid, what-happens-everyday approach is far from an active script, a rental first might be the best approach to viewing this movie before buying.  Enjoy!
B00005JPLU|4.0|'300' is a bloody epic that combines the best of the old and new.  Sporting sweeping cinematography that is partly colorized and partly bleached, the film has the effect of being a glorified version of an older film.  Featuring relentless battle scenes that resemble a slow motion version of a graphic video game, '300' leaves nothing to the battle imagination.  Sensuality from barebreasted women to men is sweeping red capes and loinclothes is up front to mix with the bloodbath of killer war scenes that artfully show hand-to-hand and full-scope visions of battles.    The story as many have heard is about the Spartan battle against the Persians in Thermopylae.  Presented as a defensive measure against demi-God, King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), ancient warfare presents another deterrent in favor of peace before the advent of Alfred Noble's attempt to make war obsolete by inventing dynamite.  Indeed, some of the best moments are when the war heroes or the narrator waxes poetic, and we get a badly needed break from the bloodbath.  Sometimes the story is narrated; at others it is pronounced with great stature by King hero, Leonidas (Shakespearean actor Gerard Butler).  Either way, whenever the story overrides it wins.  The political developments help to deepen the story and keep us from a continual overdrive.  His Queen wife, Gorgo (Lena Headey), frames the man and his mission and complements the movie as well.  Furthermore, the elements of ancient religion give the movie as much dimension as the nearly 3-D blood spurs that emanate at 'Matrix'-like angles.    Thoroughly innovative, but at times overdone, '300' is a force to be reckoned with.

Resist; lets take control of our lives and live for pleasure not pain. You dont need to suppress yourself with medication, there is nothing wrong with you. There is something wrong with the world.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|This is a great series, but be aware, this does not work on xbox 360 hd dvd drive. It would be nice if there was a warning about this listed somewhere on the site. It will only work on a standard hd dvd player. Nice, now I have to return this for the standard dvd version. What a shame, i really wanted to see it in high def.   * Update:  I have heard from other reviewers on this site that the hd dvd's do work on xbox 360 after an update from xbox live. This is a good thing for some, just not for me. I don't have xbox live because i never really felt the need for it. I just wanted to play games with friends the old school way, and watch high def movies. Maybe now i'll have no other choice but to get it then. 5 stars for the series, 2 stars for my xbox hd dvd player.
B000002I27|5.0|The Doors-Strange Days *****<br /><br />Darker then the bands purple hued debut album could not be more true. Strange Days is simply one of the darkest and greatest albums in all of rock n' roll history. The band came close with their debut but Strange Days is where The Doors sealed the deal as the greatest band in all of the psycadelic genre of rock n' roll. All bets were off when this was released no more then six months after their emphamous debut. Anything experimental was a must on this record. Paul Rothchilds amazing production is at its stunning best here. Strange Days sounds more like it was recorded in 1997 rather then in 1967. The sound is big and phenomonal musician ship sure helped out. Robby Krieger played some of the best guitar of his career, while John Densmore became more experimental on this album then the first, and Ray Manzerek laid down some outstanding keyboard playing here, proving he is in fact the king of the keyboards. Jim \\"The Lizard King\\" Morrison showcases some of his most powerful vocals here, and his lyrics are as we all know are amazing, a true poet in a rock gods body.<br /><br />The album opens with the errie title track 'Strange Days' which is not only the perfect way to start the album, but also one of the bands very best songs. The dark keyboards set the stage for the rest of the album. 'You're Lost Little Girl' is very out there and a hard track to describe much less define, one that honestly has to be heard to appreciate. 'Love Me Two Times' as we all know is one of the greatest songs of all time. The guitar is phenomenal, and Morrisons vocals are top notch here. 'Unhappy Girl' is an amazing song. It some how manages to mesh the bright happy go lucky Beachboys/early Beatles/Supremes sound of the 1960's with a darker twist to make one of the bands most creative creations. 'Horse Latitudes' is mearly just a Morrison poem set to music. Mainly just spoken word, but makes for a very interesting track none the less. 'Moonlight Drive,' the very song Jim Morrison sung for Manzerek in hopes if getting him to start a band with himself. Some impressive slide guitar work from Krieger makes for one classic song. 'People Are Strange' is yet another rock n' roll classic. The movie \\"The Lost Boys\\" used the song as their theme. One of the most errie songs in all of rock n' roll and also one of the best. 'My Eyes Have Seen You' may be a bit repetitive but it is one of the very best songs the band ever did. The guitar is out of this world and Morrisons vocals are the best here that they are on the entire album. Fantastic song. 'I Cant See Your Face In My Mind' is the weakest song on the album, and really the only weak song on the album. It is just missing something. But still really not a bad song, just not memorable. 'When The Musics Over' is quite simply one of the very best songs ever written and recorded in all of music...ever! 'When The Musics Over' is to Strange Days what 'The End' was to the bands selftitled debut The Doors. Robby Krieger plays the best guitar of his career on this song, and the solo alone is worth every penny of the album cost. The lyrics are maybe Morrisons best. The whole band plays together as if they are on one eleven minute acid trip, which makes for an amazingly interestingly never boring yet very long song. The Doors couldnt have recorded a better song to end the album with. The song may be teh very best song to ever end a rock n' roll album.<br /><br />The Doors was an amazing album, and L.A. Woman was better then that, but Strange Days is easily the singlegreatest thing The Doors ever recorded. Even if they had stayed together and Morrison had not went to the otherside, they might have come close but would have never topped this. Esentially one of the greatest albums in all of musical history, Stranges Days by The Doors is one of those albums that changed the world and is esential to every music collection along with Srg. Pepper, Kind Of Blue, Dark Side Of The Moon, Highway61 Revisited, and Nevermind.Moon, Highway 61 Revisited, and Nevermind.
0761129235|5.0|Hundreds of self-help books proclaim the wisdom of \\"thinking big.\\" Here is an author who serves up just the opposite with his great book extolling the virtues of thinking small.<br /><br />I loved this book and strongly recommend it because I believe it makes a point so often missed in success books.  Big dreams and big ideas are indeed important.  But, they must be broken down into a series of steps that can be accomplished to make progress.<br /><br />Millions would love to lose, say, 30 pounds (or whatever). The reason so many fail to do so is that they look for the big thing rather than appreciating that losing weight is a function of a series of small actions.<br /><br />Dr. Maurer makes the case, and makes it well, for creating a life of continuous improvement. A life of a series of small gains which collectively create the big gains.  Maurer helps us understand why our brains respond better to small challenges than big challenges that can create subconscious flight.<br /><br />For a book focused on the small steps, the book walks the talk.  It is a quick read. I appreciate that the author succinctly makes his points, illustrates with an example, and then promptly moves on to the next point. Those who weigh books to determine value will undoubtedly be disappointed. Those looking for insights to help shape a personal philosophy for success will find this a great book.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|This review is about the Rhino re-mix version. The sound quality is excellent. This is probably as close to the master tapes as we will ever come. The re-mixes are fine, and if you are expecting these mixes to be just like the old ones we've all heard 1000s of times before on Classic Rock radio, you need to set that aside and just listen. The mixes are a slightly different perspective on the music that gives the songs new life. LA Woman and Riders On The Storm were relegated to the last (inner) tracks of the LP and therefore had a lot of compression and distortion. On this CD you really hear them for the first time. <br />   <br />The Warner DVD Audio of this album is pretty bad, so buy this and enjoy clear 2 channel sound instead of 5 channel sloppiness.

B000000993|5.0|Even though I can speak from personal experience that fans of Tool can get uber-defensive to the point where it's kind of creepy, for the most part they at least have reason to have much praise. In many ways similar to Rush, each band member offers an element worthy of being in the band without having dispensable members. Before they hit a bigger plateau with their next release \\"Aenima\\", Undertow was the best Tool record and for some it still is. While for me, it's arguably Lateralus, it's still hard to throw anything negative towards Undertow, their first full-length (with the EP Opiate coming out first). <br /> <br />Intolerance: One of my favorite songs from the album. From its heavy opening riff to the smooth tempo changes to it's catchy \\"lie cheat and steal\\" hook that is so fun to belt out, it's one of the better Tool songs around. 9/10 <br /> <br />Prison Sex: If there's one word to describe this one, it's kind of \\"fun\\". It just has a great groove that you can almost dance to (some atypical dance of course). Controversial lyrics and video, it's another one of the more popular songs and worth a listen. 9/10 <br /> <br />Sober: If it wasn't for Schism, this would probably be the de facto signature Tool song although probably people consider it to be. Structure-wise it's pretty simple which is strange with Maynard's vocals getting progressively more emotive in the chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />Bottom: Man they're on a roll. Another homerun with heavy riffs and a great vocals and end scream by Maynard. My only complaint is the really quiet section. Spoken by Henry Rollins, While it does set up the climax, it takes a bit too long to get to. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Crawl Away: To be honest, I'm not completely fond of this one. The riffs are there, vocals and musicianship but there's just something that doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's having 4 great songs in a row and while it's a listenable track, it wasn't as immediate as others. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Swamp Song: One of themore underrated songs on the album. One thing that's quite surprising about it is how hooky it is. A guitar riff you can hum all day to a sing-along section (if you want) when Maynard sings \\"I hope it sucks, I hope it sucks you, ****er, I hope it sucks you down\\". 9/10 <br /> <br />Undertow: Right from the start, it's very upbeat and chockful of riffs with many tempo changes that just feels right (it's rare to find most bands who are that comfortable with jumping all over the place). Even though it's not that big a favorite, it's still an album highlight. 8/10 <br /> <br />Four Degrees: A sitar riff opens the song with a main catchy riff you'll hear throughout the song. Like many Tool songs, there's usually an element that brings you into the songs and makes it worth remembering, unlike most bands who play for 10 minutes and you can't remember a thing. 8/10 <br /> <br />Flood: To be honest, I'm not a big fan of this. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, it just doesn't hook me the way it should. It's not like I need poppy melodies or radio-friendly lengths but I at least need something to make the song memorable and this one took awhile. Probably a grower. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />I'll forego trying to review Disgustipated since it's just so...weird. But besides that, this is a very consistent record and while it doesn't have the acclaim and success Aenima or Lateralus had, it's still a very worthy addition to the band's catalogue.
B000002AP1|5.0|Iggy And The Stooges-Raw Power *****<br /><br />If you were to make a list of the one hundred greatest albums of all time Raw Power by Iggy And The Stooges would easily be in teh top ten, maybe even in the top five. No other album in the history of rock n' roll has captured a moment in time so perfectly, and brutaly. 1973, music was changing, things were not so happy an more, the 1960's were long gone, and rebellion was begining to rear its head once again as it did in 1953. A new nature was coming, a new style, a new attitude. Punk took the thoughts of the 1960's and gave them actions. Iggy And The Stooges put that on display for the entire world to see with Raw Power.<br /><br />'Search And Destroy,' one of the single greatest moments in music history opens this historic album. With guitar from another planet and a swagger to match Ron Asheton and Iggy Pop created one of the most anialating songs in history. 'Search And Destroy' has been cited by many punk legends as the moment they changed the way they thought about music. 'Gimme Danger' which is another killer song. Some Iggy Pops best vocals can be heard here. Part acoustic, part electric 'Gimme Danger' is one of the best songs Iggy ever lent his name to. Its so dark and dangerous, no pun intended. This is one of those rare songs that is just so good it cant be described in words because it must be heard to fully appreciate. 'Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell' which was originaly called 'Hard To Beat' is another yet killer song. Only Iggy would have the nerve to rename a song thirty some years after it was first released to the world. One of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard is in this song. Superb. Fast, loud, unapologetic, and ferocious. All the makings of a excellent song. 'Penetration' has the coolest piano work ever. Simply Amazing. A very sexy song, which Im sure was what Iggy was going for. The lyrics are the most unattractive thing ever but the bands overall performance makes the song very sexy. Very slow, and slimy. This song is reminicent of 'Loose' from the Fun House album. Once again guitar, guitar, guitar. Asheton is one of the most underrated and overlooked guitar players in history. The title track 'Raw Power' may be the best song on the album, maybe thats why they decided to name the album after it. Great lyrics, and very catchy. Once again the piano is great. Not very complicated or fancy or anything but it fits the song perfectly. The Stooges are known for using instruments in songs that you wouldnt normaly expect to hear them in. But when they do it works somehow. 'I Need Somebody' is a personal favorite. Nice and slow blues number with mostly acoustic guitars. Very cool, very Velvet Underground/Lou Reed esq. Easily one of the top three songs the band ever recorded. Okay, 'Shake Appeal' is without a doubt the best song the band ever made in my opinion. Phenominal. Amazing guitar riff, lyrics, delivery, the entire package is great. This song best describes The Stooges and what they stood for. If you were to only hear one Iggy Pop And The Stooges song in your life, 'Shake Appeal' would be the one to hear. Fantastic is all you can say about it. 'Death Trip' is a lot like the title track 'Raw Power.' It is a great way to end the album because it is a great song but nothing about really sets it apart from the rest of the album other then the extended guitar solo and that it is the last song on the album.<br /><br />If you were to own one punk album in your life or even just hear one, I must say this is the one to hear or own. It is the best, and the one that inspired almost every punk band ever. Don't let the shoddy production shy you away, the music overcomes that, and now the remastered version despite what purists may say it does sound better and really inhances the albums overall quality. Raw Power is one of those rare moments in rock n' roll history that shouldn't be missed or past up by anyone. This was the last Stooges album for almost thirty years and boy did they go out with a bang. Brilliant!ost thirty years and boy did they go out with a bang. Brilliant!
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I've been familiar with the Heads for decades, but only recently became a fan, thanks mainly to my nephew, who has the same curiosity toward rock music I do.  I find now that I have cut my nose off to spite my face ignoring this piece so long.<br /><br />  David Byrne's nerd-psychotic personna drives the band, but what a band.  Tina Weymouth is one of rock's greatest bassists ever, easily in the ranks of Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins or other great funk style players, and that's pretty heady company.<br /><br />  The grooves are the greatest thing about \\"Remain In Light\\", especially \\"The Great Curve\\" that features Adrian Belew on skronk guitar.  The band shows its ability at great atmospherics with the one-two offering of \\"Lightning Wind\\" and \\"Overlord\\", which is a great hypnotic drone piece that reminds one of \\"Us And Them\\" from Pink Floyd or Zeppelin's \\"In The Light\\", yet not sounding derivative of either tune.<br /><br />  This is the Talking Heads' masterwork and belongs in your collection now.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Should have been the Oscar winner for best picture -- it was by far the best and most involving movie I saw last year. Helen Mirren took best actress gold for her astonishing portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, caught between worlds in the days following the death of Diana.<br /><br />The DVD comes with two commentaries: an upbeat one on the production from director Stephen Frears and screeenwriter Peter Morgan, and another from Robert Lacey, an expert on the royal family. Lacey serves admirably as a translator for the folks in Region 1, who almost certainly missed many references whilst viewing the film in theaters. It's a highly recommended talk for admirers of the film who want an enriched  viewing experience the second or third time around.<br /><br />The other extras are efficient but routine making-ofs. Mirren says she became comfortable in the role by thinking of herself as painting a portrait, a process in which the artist's role is to bring some of herself to the finished subjective work.<br /><br />Video and audio on the standard DVD release are as you'd expect, sturdy and well-bred.

B000JUBHNU|5.0|Slayer-Christ Illusion *****<br /><br />Finally!! The return of the great and powerful Dave Lombardo on the all mighty metal thrown of drums. The question has long been asked who is better Dave Lombardo, or Lars Ulrich or Metallica, well Lars is a killer drummer but the man doesnt hold a candle to Lombardo, the man is the reason metal drums are played the way they are! This album also marks the return of the original line-up of the most evil and powerful metal band in the world. Christ Illusion is the bands best album and most concistant album in at least 12 years. Tom Araya plays that patent rumbling bass. Jeff Hanamen and Kerry King play some of the best guitar of their career.<br /><br />Christ Illusion seems to have an underlining theme of relegious warfare. Songs like 'Skeleton Christ' 'Flesh Storm' 'Cult' and 'Jihad' are all clear indicators that the band is severly opposed to all regious motivated war, and really just religion in general because more people have been killed by religious warfare then by anyother thing ever, and that number keeps growing each and every day. 'Eyes Of The Insane' is one of the very best songs Slayer ever recorded. Arayas vocals are over the top and Lombardos drumming is nothing short of incredible. Easily going to be a future classic as well as a live favorite for Slayer fans. 'Jihad' may be the best song on the album, either that or 'Cult.' 'Jihad' more then any other song sums up the over all feel of the album. \\"This is Gods War\\" is the chorus to the song, with a chorus like that the song could not have a better title. Also Kings lead guitar riff is one of the coolest and best guitar riffs ever created. 'Black Serenade' just sounds evil doesnt it. The whole song is just scary, satan probably has this on high rotation as we speak. 'Cult' may or may not be the best song on the album, its tied with 'Jihad.' EIther way Slayer hit the nail on the head with this song. A very catchy chorus, one that got a friend of mine who hates Slayer to sing along with it. The guitar solo is one of legend. Greatly arranged and fits in the song perfectly. Lombardo is the only drummer who would have been able to play something that brutal as a back beat. The album ends with 'Supremist.' A song that ends the album as brutally as it began. IT may be the darkest and heaviest song on the album, which in Slayers case is a great way to end the album.<br /><br />Christ Illusion may not be the very best album Slayer ever made but many Slayer fans are holding the album as one of their all time best. Just behind South Of Heaven, and Reign In Blood is where Christ Illusion should be placed as far as Slayers best albums are concernd. Those who are REAL metal fans I am confedent that you already own this. For Slayer fans, and drummers of all styles, Dave Lombardo is back thats all you need to know. It is great to hear a return to real metal for a change, so for all who dare I recomend this to you.o hates Slayer to sing along with it. The guitar solo is one of legend.

B000002V0Q|3.0|Megadeth-Countdown To Extinction ***<br /><br />This is not your older brothers Megadeth. No this is the rebirth of the band. For Countdown To Extinction the band went for more of a hard rock mainstreem sound rather then their previous thrash metal sound of their earlier records. Dave Mustain and Marti Freidmen play some of the greatest guitra of their careers here though that is for sure. Mustain would hate me for saying this but this album is to Megadeth what the self titled black album is to Metallica.<br /><br />The album opens with a killer track called 'Skin O My Teeth' which features a face melting guitar solo. An excelent way to start off the album, it really sets the pace for the rest of the record. 'Symphony Of Destruction' is one of the bands biggest and best known songs. The song is incredible featuring one of the freatest guitar solos in all of rock history, just fantastic. 'Architecture Of Aggression' is another great song. Very simular to 'Skin O My Teeth though. 'Foreclosure Of A Dream' is actually one of Megadeths all time best songs. Great time changes, a nice acoustic inro, interesting lyrics, the songs a sure win. 'Sweating Bullets' is an interesting song. It is also one of the bands best known songs. The pschitzofrinic lyrics are scary as hell, which makes for a killer song. 'This Was My Life' while is a great song but because it come after such a classic as 'Sweating Bullets' it suffers a little, it leaves you wanting more. 'Countdown To Extinction' the title track, is good but could be a whole lot better. The main guitar riff makes the song sound like a really bad and really slow power-metal song, like a demo to a Yngwie Malmsteen song. The album would have been better off with out it. 'High Speed Dirt' is another throw away, there is nothing high speed about this song. 'Psychotron' is only saved by the guitar and other wise it is actually pretty boring. 'Captive Honour' is also quite boring and features some spoken word clips and that also takes away from the song. You can feel that the song could be really good but it is missing something. 'Ashes In Your Mouth' is a great song, and probably the best song to close the album. If there were more songs like it on the album then the album would be a whole lot better. This is a great song that leaves you wanting more when it is finished and not it a bad way.<br /><br />It seems that the band lost focus about half way through the album. The first half of the album is excellent, but the second half is just boring really. This is concidered one of the bands better albums and I dont see why.

B0000C5RQF|5.0|There are many strengths of this production but admittedly one or two weaklinks.<br /><br />It is convincing as a fairytale, but please do not try to read more into it than a fairytale.<br /><br />Seen as a fairytale, the characters are mostly well-portrayed, and well-sung.<br /><br />The direction of Sir Colin Davies was masterful, and most of the protagonists gave outstanding performances. Keenlyside, Damrau and Roeschmann led the starry performance, followed closely by the Two armoured men, the Three Ladies, and even the Three Boys were well portrayed. The Speaker of the Temple was a convincing figure and superbly acted out by Thomas Allen. One or two weaker links though, from Hartmann's Tamino and Selig's Sarastro.<br /><br />Hartmann in particular was too stolid and vocally lack-lustre as Tamino. He fared better in the latter acts, but in Act I he was simply eclipsed by the Three Ladies. Selig lacked the low notes, which was a great shame, since his acting was impeccable.<br /><br />Tons of admiration to Diana Damrau's Queen of the Night.  Although the first great aria wasn't the best, the next one was a real thriller. And her acting was simply wonderful - the entire body language, plus the costume and makeup. Only one small imperfection - had the Three Ladies been dressed in a slightly different manner than their Queen, the visual effect would have been even better.<br /><br />The duets between Pamina and Papageno were immaculately given by Roeschmann and Keenlyside, the other two strong links in this production.<br /><br />I would say that Keenlyside is the current best Papageno around operatic world.<br /><br />This production is a joy to watch, and a treat to the ears.

0345494768|5.0|On May 25, 1977, fledgling director George Lucas released his \\"kids' movie,\\" a white hat/black hat Flash Gordon-esque space adventure featuring archetypal heroes and an ominous masked villain like no other. That kiddy flick remarkably has endured 30 years, spawned five successful sequels, launched a multibillion-dollar empire, and for legions of fiercely devoted followers worldwide is a religion. Love it or not, Star Wars arguably is the biggest pop-culture phenomenon since The Beatles. To honor its 30th anniversary, Rinzler provides an exhaustive record of Lucas's struggle to create Star Wars, its continuously evolving characters/plots, Hollywood's initial rejections, its everything-that-could-go-wrong-did production, and its ultimate unimaginable triumph. On another level, this is a feel-good story of a determined guy who pursued his dream and was rewarded with a kingdom. The film's history unfurls through interviews with Lucas, cast, and crew members offering both positive and negative remembrances, plus script remnants revealing the story's multiple incarnations. And that's just the appetizer! Half the feast--with heaps of dessert--are the never-before-seen production pix and concept art offering serious behind-the-scenes peeks fanboys live for (keep `em coming!). Portions of this info have appeared previously, but never in such fine detail (yo, Del Rey: identical volumes for The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi please!). Rinzler's Making of will be an instant fan fave and a shining star in that galaxy far, far away. Outstanding, especially at this price.
B000002TPS|3.0|Megadeth-Youthanasia  ***<br /><br />To cut straight to the chase this is not the best Megadeth album. Not by a long shot. I heard nothing but good things about this album so bought it and was so let down that it isnt even funny. Mustain and Friedmen are once again as always excellent. The two of them had they stayed friends and been able to stand each other would be rivaling James and Kirk by now.<br /><br />'Reckonin Day' is a great song. The best way to start of the album really. A nice way to get the ball a rollin. 'Train Of Cosequences' is the best song on the album, and it is really just down hill after this. The song is actually one of the best songs Mustain ever wrote. The guitar is great and the lyrics are signature Mustain. Some of the songs like 'Addicted To Chaos' 'A Tout Le Monde' and 'The Killing Road' are all excellent songs. The latter containts an excellent guitar solo. The title track 'Youthanasia' is a diamond in the ruff really because it is surrounded by awful songs. 'Elysian Fields' is just flat out bad. 'Family Tree' is boring and offers nothing and every time I try to listen to this album all the way through I skip this song. 'Blood Of Heros' has its moments where it is a great song and then others it is just annoying, and Mustains voice is strained on it, it seems. 'Victory' is not victory for the band, the song just flat out sucks, sorry die-hards but lets face facts it sucks. The other songs werent even worth mentioning.<br /><br />This is one of the worst Megadeth albums by far. It only offers a hand full of good songs, and even those are sub-par to say the least. There is only really one excellent song anyways. Youthanasia is out of all the Megadeth albums I own, the worst. It is not worth owning, buy the best of for 'Train Of Consequences' because it is the only song really worth owning.
B000F48CD8|3.0|Would this have been hyped to death and sold so much if it didn't feature Jack White? I have my doubts. It's a decent album that occasionally hits big.  But there's not enough strength here to justify the hype. Which is where Jack White plays in - most rock critics consider him the John Lennon of his generation (which he is NOT - there will never be anyone anywhere NEAR John Lennon), so they love everything Jack puts out. Even if it's as mediocre as this is.<br /><br />Getting on with the show, there are quite a few songs here that justify the rave reviews - Steady As She Goes is at least as good as the White Stripes' best; Hands, Broken Boy Soldier and Intimate Security all have a cool garage-rock vibe, and Level adds a flute part to the madness.<br /><br />But I see Jack White as a distinctively second-rank figure (which means he's head-and-shoulders above most of today's rockers, and about at the level of Creedence Clearwater Revival or The Police), and this is a distinctively second (or maybe even third)-rank album. Together, Yellow Sun and Call it a Day all suffer from what I call \\"embarrassing lyrics syndrome\\". And does anybody need the tape loop experiment Blue Veins? I doubt it. Ah well. This can be awesome at times, but know what you're getting into - an average, slightly overrated album.
B000O75F7C|5.0|You bet this one gets 5 stars -- my goodness! <br /> <br />What nice growth from these guys since Deadwing.  This album has a sound more mature than any of the previous albums -- this is an album put out by a group of guys who took a lot of time with it, and who obviously cared about the music, production and sound that went into it.  It's hard to pin down what exactly the growth is, but it sure sounds like the orchestration has taken a front seat in this album.  There are fewer outright riffs, whether guitar or keyboard riffs, but what riffs they have come up with fit together with all the other parts very nicely.  As cliche as it sounds, they seem to be doing a lot more with less.  Most of the usual Porcupine Tree trademarks can all be found here: time changes that play smoother than other bands play in standard time, outstanding analog synth sounds, monstrously tight and big drumming.  The only thing missing is Steven Wilson's slide guitar parts that he first ripped off from 'Comfortably Numb.' <br /> <br />The sound and lyrics are unquestionably dark and melancholy, switching with ease between heaviness and brutality, distance and serenity -- less industrial sounding than In Absentia, lusher and denser than Deadwing, less hooky than Lightbulb Sun.  I don't know that I'd call it the best Porcupine Tree album, but, like all Porcupine Tree albums, each one seems different and has its own strengths, and this one is no different.  I will say this for it, though, no track is boring or sounds like something you've heard before. <br /> <br />Steven Wilson sings with his usual reserved and emotionless delivery on all these tracks, although it was great to hear his delivery for the line 'Your mouth should be boarded up,' where it finally sounded like he let loose a little bit and put some genuine feeling into it, as if he really meant it that time.  His voice and usual delivery certainly fit well with this band, but it was good to hear him let go a little bit. <br /> <br/>Two guest performances of note: Alex Lifeson, from Rush, contributes a guitar solo, which sounded to me like he mailed in the performance from overseas.  It sounded like a bunch of noodling with some whammy bar thrown in when he couldn't figure out what to play next.  He manages to follow the chord changes, but in a brute force and inelegant manner, as though his timing was off and he couldn't get his lines to flow together terribly well.  Robert Fripp contributes what are termed 'soundscapes' to 'Way Out of Here.'  It's hard to hear just exactly where the band stops and his performance starts, but since the track as a whole has a great sound, I'm inclined to give him some props for his performance. <br /> <br />Finally, as a criticism of the lyrics, Steven Wilson's criticism of the X-Box generation, it sounds like he lays into the kids an awful lot.  Seems like a pretty heavy burden to dump on children, doesn't it?  Who's truly at fault? <br /> <br />So, for those who might be nervous that the Porcupine Tree stream of outstanding albums might be in danger of flagging, put those fears aside.     This one's just as good as all the others.

B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones *****<br /><br />Hey Ho Lets Go...and so it began that start of something so amazing nothing will ever come close again. The Ramones single handedly created one of the greatest albums ever, along with one of the greatest musical movements in the history of rock n' roll. The bands debut has gone down in history as one of the most criticly aclaimed albums of all time. It is teh album that gave the New York punk movement the notoriaty it desereved.<br /><br />Joeys slurred lyrics and vocal delivery are classic and signature only to him. He sings with his Brooklyn accent. Dee Dee las down some killer bass lines, Tommy plays the original punk drum beat, and Johnny plays the prototypical punk guitar. While many of the songs do sound the same they are all excellent. The three chord format works just as good for The Ramones as it does for AC/DC. The thing about The Ramones that blows my mind is how they managed not to become the biggest band of all time. Their songs were a hell of a lot catchier then even The Beatles' and The Beachboys together. They dont sound bad or play bad so how they managed to stay under the radar for so long and never really truly make it big until after they broke up is beyond me.<br /><br />The album is fantastic from the first guitar chug of the imortal 'Blitzkrieg Bop' to the ringing of the amps at the end of 'Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World.' Every song is catchy and easy to relate to for any teenager. 'Blitzkrieg Bop' 'Beat On The Brat' and 'Judy Is A Punk' all went on to become Ramones and punk music classics. Songs like 'Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue' went on to have countless polls, magazines, and lists named after it. 'Havana Affair' inspired many a band to get together and while it may not have done that for the Red Hot Chili Peppers the band did cover the song as a tribute to the late Joey Ramone, and I might add they did an amazing cover of the song.<br /><br />The Ramones will not only go down in history as one of punks great bands but as one of all musics greatest bands ever, and this is one of if not the greatest debut albums ever, sure to be on any list of the 100 greatest albums of all time. 100 albums may not seem like that big of a deal to some but when you think of all the albums ever made in rock n' roll history that is a monsterous acheivement. This is recomended to everyone from Billy Joel and Beachboy fans to fans of hardcore punk like Bad Brains, and The Casualties.s one of punks great bands but as one of all musics greatest bands ever, and this is one of if not the greatest debut albums ever, sure to be on any list of the 100 greatest albums of all time. 100 albums may not seem like that big of a deal to some but when you think of all the albums ever made in rock n' roll history that is a monsterous acheivement.

B000NHQLPS|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese has made a good living reminding us that the human body is a fragile thing. A small, inanimate object such as a blade or a slug of lead can shatter the delicate human envelope and spill out its life-sustaining contents onto dirty city sidewalks. One moment you're here, the next you're a heap of flesh lying in a widening crimson pool. Violent and sudden death is no respecter of persons -- a 9mm slug takes down the good and the bad with equal ferocity.   <br /> <br />Scorsese's Academy Award winning film, The Departed, is his latest reminder of these facts. This is a dark story set in the seamy South Boston city innards where a decent gesture or simple honest ideal is nowhere to be found, not with the crooks, not with the police. Suspicion and duplicity reign. Trust no one. Likeable or familiar and neighborly characters do not exist. This is a story about begetting - bad begets bad, there is no escaping it. And yet an inexorable reckoning waits just around the corner, probably in the form of a gunshot to the head. Even good intentions, if initiated with evil machinations, will eventually return in the form of a silencer. Simple goodness is an unattainable ideal, unrealistic even. Foul language and even fouler attitudes on both sides of the moral line suggest that the line has become so blurred that cop and crook seem interchangeable, with a further implication that this is the real world.  <br /> <br />Mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) nurtures and plants a mole, an informer (Matt Damon), into the Boston City Police detective squad. For their part the police, headed up by Captains Queenan and Ellerby and Sergeant Dignam, (Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Whalberg), are fiercely determined to bust Costello and his organization. They imbed Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) as an undercover agent in Costello's mob. The two moles are unaware of the existence of the other, and each is dogged in carrying out his assignment. And so followsround after round of second-guessing, suspense, blackmail, intrigue and brutality. <br /> <br />As Costello, Nicholson turns in a perfect performance of the consummate, sleazy and depraved animal, a human predator ready to swallow anyone he can use to sustain his life and his lordship.  As with many of this actor's roles, there is a deliciously seductive facet to his shady characters --- the toothy smile, the soft-spoken casual manner, the serpent holding forth the irresistible apple. Any small truths uttered from his mouth are designed to slowly trap you in an imperceptible yet closing dark web of lies. As mob boss there is nothing of the grand and prim Don Corleone here. Nicholson's Costello is shabby, unshaven, polluted, yet sharp - nobody's fool.  <br /> <br />Character portrayals led by the ensemble of Damon, Whalberg, Baldwin and Sheen, reel with tremendous power and conviction along with some nuance, but are more or less standard fare, especially in a Scorsese film. There is one exception, however. DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, in part due to William Monahan's excellent Oscar-winning script that allows this character a broader unveiling, delves deep into the subtleties, tensions and grinding internal conflicts of a real three-dimensional character. All the other roles, either in solo or ensemble, though riveting, seem to exist as the canvas for DiCaprio's portrait to unfold.  <br /> <br />If there is a hero in this film it is Billy Costigan. His is the character of deep internal struggle. He needs a mentor, a loyal friend, someone to help him come to terms with his shady Boston \\"southy\\" family background, his personal longings, and the soul-crushing and astonishingly cynical police team who cruelly berate him and then put  him to work. Costigan's painful oscillation between brutality, rage, vulnerability and tenderness is an unheeded plea for someone to help him come to grips with his dark, vicious existence and his higher instincts of compassion and light. In his affair with a police psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farminga) we see a vulnerable and pathetic young man, one searching for gentleness and meaning in a wretched world. This relationship works for Billy to a point, but mostly it works for us as we witness more of Costigan's unfolding, multifaceted character. In the end what he wants so terribly much is a personal identity, he wants his life, he wants to start over.  <br /> <br />DiCaprio's brilliant portrayal captures it all, and with an absolute honesty that is so rare these days. The trap for the average actor is to play the role with a flat linear rage, followed by sentimentality, then with maudlin self indulgence and self consciousness. The demands of this role are vast - from rage that is invested with a hint of fear and confusion, to a churning visceral boil kept scarcely under control, to the softness of a lost little boy who just found his mother. Where Nicholson's fine performance unveils two lines converging on a point, DiCaprio's drips with fullness of perspective - Oscar-worthy to be sure, but overlooked in 2006 by the Academy. The actor did, however, walk away with the Austin Film Critics 2006 for Best Actor and was nominated by the British Academy Awards and The Chicago Film Critics Circle. <br /> <br />Scorsese's mastery of this type of material is legendary. Desolate characters and circumstances are mirrored and supported by the natural backdrop of south Boston. Lighting, settings (even the police station seems dark and scary), shooting angles and camera motion all conspire to stir up a constant sense of uneasiness along with an ever present and palpable purpose of dark destiny. A bright, humorous and ironic shot placed in juxtaposition to the overpowering force of the film would have made for a nice touch of relief.  <br /> <br />The Departed will go down in cinematic history as a powerful and important film. DiCaprio's presence as an actor will continue to rise to new heights. With this filmhe cements his cross over from mere stardom to accomplished actor. <br />
B000HA4WTS|4.0|Let me first say that, yes, I am a fan of this franchise.  It's not the Godfather franchise.  It's not the Lord of the Rings franchise.  It's a simple, repetitive plot wrapped in a bunch of cool cars.  But seriously, that's what I want to see sometimes.  The dialogue is sketchy.  The action is unrealistic.  The plot is silly.  However all of these things keep you from having to think too much, which is the intent of this series: just watch the flashy colors and enjoy yourself for a little while.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of Beatle's songs. I was fortunate in my younger days to own (I think) ALL of the original albums, but nowI have themon CD and I would recommend this CD collection to anyine who likes good music.
B000000WA4|4.0|The Smashing Pumpkins-Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness ****<br /><br />The Smashing Pumpkins are one of if not the greatest band of the 1990s, and will some day be concidered on eof the greatest bands of all time. Many people concider Mallon Collie And The Infinite Sadness to be the bands best album and one of the greatest albums ever. Well thats because it is. The band was at its best here. Siamese Dream is a much better album as a whole, but this because it has so many songs has more room for error. Many feel the album would have been better as a single disc, we'll see.<br /><br />Corgan who we all came to find would go back and rerecord over everyone elses stuff once they left the studio so he really is the only one that you here. He is at his best musicaly, idealy, and lyricly.<br /><br />Disc One: Dawn To Dusk<br /><br />'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' the title track which opens the album does it perfectly. 'Tonight, Tonight' 'Zero' and the massive success of 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings' were all big hit singles still get played quite a bit on the radio. 'Zero' which is maybe the best thing the band ever recorded is so in your face that it is not even funny. The lyrics are just scary, and deppresing at the same time. The guitar is some of Corgans best, a classic thats for sure. 'Tonight, Tonight' apart from having one of the all time greatest music videos to accompany it is one of the bands better songs. With mostly acoustic guitar and lots of string arrangements this song is a sure win. 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings' is The Smashing Pumpkins all time biggest hit and one of the most over played songs of all time, but it is still one of the best songs ever and the lyrics are pure poetry. Corgan has some issues as you can tell from listening to this song. 'Cupid De Locke' and 'Take Me Down' are both very similar songs.They are both slower and quiter then most of the rest of the first side and are very beautiful songs. 'Here Is No Why' is a harder rocker and a great asset to the album. 'Galapogos' 'Muzzle' and 'Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans' are all songs that the album could have done with out.<br /><br />All in all the first half of the album is pretty good. Only a few songs that could be thrown out, and the rest is amazing.<br /><br />Disc Two: Twilight To Starlight<br /><br />'Where Boys Fear To Tread' opens the second have greatly. 'Bodies' keeps the album going nicley and segues right into 'Thiry-Three' which is also one of the best songs on the album. '1979' is the only really big song on the album and it was massive when released as a single. The song that introduced most to The Smashing Pumpkins. Easily one of the best songs Corgan ever wrote, very electronic and goth, but very good with great drumming and nice guitar effects add a nice feel to the song that sets it apart from the rest of the album. 'X.Y.U.' is just insane, a very interesting song that is slightly out of place on the album but is still a great song. 'Lilly (My One And Only)' maybe the best song on the second disc. Its hard to explain, the piano and the song are so peppy and cheer full but the lyrics are sort of sad. A perfect song, and a truly original one at that. 'In The Arms Of Sleep' 'Thru The Eyes Of Ruby' and 'By Starlight' could have all benifited the album had they not been recorded. They are really just filler and the album would be a lot better with out them.<br /><br />Once again disc two is really good except for a few songs that are nothing more then filler, but over all another great side to the album.<br /><br />All in all could Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness been left a single album no! While yes there are still a number of songs that could have been left off there would still be way to many songs for a single disc, this album had to be big and huge and over the top. Could it have benifited from less songs, yes it could have. Is this the bands best album, no not by a long shot, is it one of the better albums inrock history, yes it is. Should you own it, is that even a question you are really debating at this point, click the order button.ne of the better albums in rock history, yes it is.

B000JCSBU0|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could give this movie any less than four stars.  So what if it doesn't give a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.  The emotion a movie evokes should not be the most important criteria by which the film is judged.  The degree to which the emotion is evoked should be the primary gauge.  Oh boy does Requiem for a Dream succeed in doing so.  Never have I had my mood so extremely affected by a piece of art.  Such intense emotional reactions are ordinarily reserved for real life personal tragedies.  Sure I would've of basked in the euphoria of a happy ending, but in turn I'd have been deprived of a purely visceral experience that only a once-in-a-lifetime movie can deliver...this happens to be that one in my lifetime.
0142004235|5.0|I usually do not read the comments of fellow reviewers at this site (or, in some cases, at least not until after I have written my own). I was, however,interested in finding out whether Steinbeck and his tale still held interest for today's readers. The answer seems to be yes. Moreover, I was also interested in what other people had to say about the symbolic nature of the clash between brothers and its relationship to the old oft-told biblical tales going back to the `first family'.     Damn, life has definitely been tougher since the `fall' from the garden. The morale to be derived from Steinbeck's novel is, apparently, that while the `fall of man' under the spell of earthly temptations had its downside humankind is better for the struggle. A strong argument can moreover be made that without that struggle by fallen humankind no serious progress would have been made.  That struggle here  is epitomized by the characters, tensions and actions of the two brothers (in both generations father Adam's and son  Aron's) which makes me believe that  that Steinbeck may see this process an eternal struggle and that we are endlessly doomed to roll that rock up the hill just to have it come crashing back down on us.    Those who have only seen the 1950's movie version of this novel starring, among others, James Dean and a young Julie Harris have missed some great writing about the effects of the struggle to rebuilt and attempts at redemption in the wake of the fall of Adam Trask and his struggle to change his ways. And through him, his sons. The movie (that I had seen long before reading the book) skips over the compelling first section which deals with the seemingly pre-ordained destruction of Adam, by his `wife', and his own character, among others. Moreover, in the movie the demonic role of the `wife' Kathy is glossed over (probably due to the less tolerate and more squeamish mores about `fallen women' in the 1950's). She is not a `nice' person. However, in the book she is positvely evil. Read the book and see why we, even the best of us, are all living just East of Eden.
0446693804|1.0|Landon looks back on his life, and how it changed when he was seventeen.  He is a senior in high school that year, in his small town in North Carolina.  His father, a politician who is never home much, is worried about Landon getting into college with his grades and lack of activities, so he pressures Landon into running for class president.  Although Landon isn't very excited about the idea, he does it and wins.  That means he has to find a date for a dance on very short notice, since all class officers have to attend and Landon doesn't want to go by himself.  He hadn't planned on going, and he knows most of the girls he knows already have dates.  In desperation, he asks Jamie Sullivan, daughter of a local preacher whose wife died when Jamie was born. <br /> <br />Jamie is very odd and doesn't really have any friends at all.  She is nice and sweet to everyone, and always carries around a Bible wherever she goes.  She is very into religion, she volunteers at an orphanage, and all of the other high school kids think she is very strange and stay away from her.  When Landon asks her to go to the dance, she agrees.  The dance is a disaster from Landon's point of view, but Jamie says she had a wonderful time and is happy Landon asked her. <br /> <br />Later that year, Landon, one of the only two boys in the senior drama class, is chosen to be the male lead in the annual Christmas play written by Jamie's father.  The female lead is played by Jamie.  As they attend rehearsals, Jamie seems to like Landon more and more.  She asks him to walk her home and she is always happy to see him.  Landon isn't sure how he feels, especially when all of his friends are making fun of him for going out with Jamie.  Then, on the night of the play, everything changes. <br /> <br />This story was just far too perfect.  The characters fell right into line, Landon fell in love with Jamie for some unknown reason, just in time for heartbreaking tragedy.  The book was cliche and a bit insulting, as the author seemed to believe he didn't have to do anything to explain why Landon would ever have fallen for Jamie.  Honestly, she was so perfect and sweet and overbearingly religious, I'm not surprised nobody in her high school class liked her.
B0000C8AVI|4.0|Slow Train Coming-Bob Dylan ****<br /><br />Who saw it coming certainly not me. Bob Dylan a born and raised Jewish man who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity. In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since. In the process of embracing Jesus Christ as his lord and saviour he managed to write an entire album about it and a hit one at that. Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years and it would also give him his last hit single of his career. Who knew that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success, only Dylan could make it happen.<br /><br />After Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord, but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared. Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy, voulnerable, or inspired again in his career<br /><br />With the exception of 'When You Gonna Wake Up' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive. The song 'When You Gonna Wake Up' was a sign of things to come in a negative way, becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan. Really it was nothing but albums of judgement. But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler (Ray Charles, Motown), I dont think the man would have stood for finger pointing. 'Gotta Serve Somebody' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970's as well as his last hit single of his career.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|No dazzling special effects or advanced story plot here.  Just a good look into the training/competing aspects of body building. <br /> <br />Its cool to see Arnold before he was a huge movie star and see some of the old-time body builders with him.  To me, he was not the star of the show.  I really liked Lou Ferrigno is this documentary.  It was good to see a few \\"nice guys\\" in the sport and to see the real bond between him and his father. <br /> <br />Its funny though.  All the bad reviews refer to Arnold as \\"Governor\\".  Seems like some people let their political views cloud all parts of their life(including how they view films that were made 30 yrs ago!).  Get a life, you extremist hacks.
B0009353IW|5.0|Out of it in Japan, actually.  I only learned about this excellent album while reading a review of Mr. Cooder's My Name is Buddy and I'm not even sure why I was reading that, never having been much of a fan.  Mistake.  Every song on this album is a winner; the beautiful Soy Luz y Sombra even got me choked up in the middle of traffic out on the ugly-as-sin 'hatchi go sen' (that would be Hwy 8).  Each song has a quite distinct emotional and musical life while the 'concept' is artistically embellished and embroidered.  Mr. Cooder orquestrates a very 'simpatico' ensemble.  In addition the music not only entertains but educates as well - a look at midcentury LA before the Dodgers - and improves your spanish (o tu ingles!) as it comes with a nicely done booklet of lyrics and translations, 52 pages worth!  One can imagine the good times and love that went into this production;  the music certainly reflects that.  A keeper.  Impressive.  Thank you.

It's a very funny book with several laugh out loud moments.  There is a touch of romance, but that isn't the focus of the book, its about Rebecca finding a passion in her life other than shopping.  It doesn't have the touch of trash that many chick-lit types have.<br /><br />I espeicially loved her realationship with her room mate.<br /><br />Totally awesome for a summer beach read or the like.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer-Christ Illusion *****<br /><br />Finally!! The return of the great and powerful Dave Lombardo on the all mighty metal thrown of drums. The question has long been asked who is better Dave Lombardo, or Lars Ulrich or Metallica, well Lars is a killer drummer but the man doesnt hold a candle to Lombardo, the man is the reason metal drums are played the way they are! This album also marks the return of the original line-up of the most evil and powerful metal band in the world. Christ Illusion is the bands best album and most concistant album in at least 12 years. Tom Araya plays that patent rumbling bass. Jeff Hanamen and Kerry King play some of the best guitar of their career.<br /><br />Christ Illusion seems to have an underlining theme of relegious warfare. Songs like 'Skeleton Christ' 'Flesh Storm' 'Cult' and 'Jihad' are all clear indicators that the band is severly opposed to all regious motivated war, and really just religion in general because more people have been killed by religious warfare then by anyother thing ever, and that number keeps growing each and every day. 'Eyes Of The Insane' is one of the very best songs Slayer ever recorded. Arayas vocals are over the top and Lombardos drumming is nothing short of incredible. Easily going to be a future classic as well as a live favorite for Slayer fans. 'Jihad' may be the best song on the album, either that or 'Cult.' 'Jihad' more then any other song sums up the over all feel of the album. \\"This is Gods War\\" is the chorus to the song, with a chorus like that the song could not have a better title. Also Kings lead guitar riff is one of the coolest and best guitar riffs ever created. 'Black Serenade' just sounds evil doesnt it. The whole song is just scary, satan probably has this on high rotation as we speak. 'Cult' may or may not be the best song on the album, its tied with 'Jihad.' EIther way Slayer hit the nail on the head with this song. A very catchy chorus, one that got a friend of mine who hates Slayer to sing along with it. The guitar solo is one of legend. Greatly arranged and fits in the song perfectly. Lombardo is the only drummer who would have been able to play something that brutal as a back beat. The album ends with 'Supremist.' A song that ends the album as brutally as it began. IT may be the darkest and heaviest song on the album, which in Slayers case is a great way to end the album.<br /><br />Christ Illusion may not be the very best album Slayer ever made but many Slayer fans are holding the album as one of their all time best. Just behind South Of Heaven, and Reign In Blood is where Christ Illusion should be placed as far as Slayers best albums are concernd. Those who are REAL metal fans I am confedent that you already own this. For Slayer fans, and drummers of all styles, Dave Lombardo is back thats all you need to know. It is great to hear a return to real metal for a change, so for all who dare I recomend this to you.o hates Slayer to sing along with it. The guitar solo is one of legend.

B00005JMCN|5.0|I just love this movie - and I have watched it many a times. Not only because it deals with horses, which I love, but more with the theme it is dealing with. <br />  <br />You will no doubt find out what the story is, or you would have seen it already (it was released around 2003 or 2004?), but there is a line which came up in the movie a couple of times, and I like it a lot. It goes something like: <br />  <br />\\"Just because someone's got banged a little, we are not gonna throw a whole life away\\". <br />  <br />It's vitally important we give ourselves or someone else a second chance. It is just equally important that we grab that second chance ourselves, whenever it comes, before it fades away.  <br />  <br />There are many second chances out there to grab, it is just a matter if we would have the heart to grab them or not. Not everyone strikes out winning the first time, but to keep fighting without losing hearts is vital.  <br />  <br />Both the Horse (Seabiscuit) and the Jockey (Red) made a comeback when everybody thought they were out for good; one (the Jockey) broke his leg in a riding accident, the other (the Horse, Seabiscuit) sprained its ligament in a race. All the doctors and vets told them they would not ride nor race again in their lives, one even suggested to put the horse down, but the Owner gave them both a second chance, they took the time to recover enough to make a comeback. And they did it, together. <br />  <br />It may sound an ordinary story, a plain sporting movie to try to inspire and draw a few tears in the audience, well, not for me. This actually happened in real life. And it happens on a daily basis to a lot of people. It matters if one has the heart to fight back. <br />  <br />Another part I like the movie Seabiscuit a lot is that: <br />  <br />The Horse Seabiscuit was a castaway whom nobody thought could achieve anything in racng - he was only 15 hands tall, not big enough for a racerhorse. The champion War Admiral he faced was a full 19 hands, and a thoroughbred. <br />  <br />\\"He may be little, but he is fierce\\" - and his hearts and racing spirits made up for it. <br />  <br />The Jockey was a losing jockey, a nobody who lost his family in the Great Depression, had to beg to ride for racings, but he had the fighting spirits to give it a go, never giving up. <br />  <br />The Trainer was an old man who knows his horses, but nobody thought well of hiring him because his ways were peculiar, even eccentric <br />  <br />The Owner was a divorced person who made out on his own, made his fortunes all by himself, but felt guilty for the death of his son. And he had had the hearts to give both the Jockey and the Trainer, and even Seabiscuit himself, a second chance(s). <br />  <br />When Seabiscuit won the races, people said the 3 of them, the Owner, Trainer and Jockey had fixed a broken horse. In a way, they all fixed each other. <br />  <br />It was a good story. It teaches me a lot. We could all learn something from it. <br />
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against The Machine-The Battle For Los Angeles *****<br /><br />Many a Rage fan as well as critic well tell you that The Battle Of Los Angeles is the very best album that Rage ever made. Is this the case, is this really better then the self titled debut Rage Against The Mahine, probably. But you will have to be the judge of that one. One thing is for sure if this isnt the bands all time best effort it is a vert close second. The bands cover album Renagades was good, but this is better, Evil Empire was a killer album but once again this takes the cake of that one as well. The bands only equal comparason is the debut.<br /><br />The Battle Of Los Angeles is a solid album through and through, not a bad track to be heard. Being released in late 1999, early 2000, at the dawn of a new millenium when the band was reaching its breaking point and on the eve of spliting they managed to hold it together and create one of the best rock albums of the last 25 years. Zack De La Rochas lyrics were the most focust and coherent they had ever been, and his vocal delivery is insane. Tim C, and Brad Wilk who may make up the greatest rhythm section in all of rock n' roll hold the album together as a whole. Then there is Tom who once again raised the bar as far as what is possible with the guitar. Tom Morello is easily one of the greatest guitarist ever to pick up the six string. Not only with his effects pedels but without them as well.<br /><br />Songs like the major hit singles 'Testify' 'Guerrilla Radio' and the phenomenol 'Sleep Now In The Fire' helped to propel the album to the number one spot and sell millions of copies. Those three songs have gone on to become radio staples still seven yers after the album was released. 'Calm Like A Bomb' 'Mic Check' and 'Born As Ghosts' are similure and slower songs that really are nice for a change of pace. 'Born Of A Broken Man' is one of the better songs the band ever recorded. You can really here the punk influence on this song. The album closes with 'War Within A Breath' which is the prefect song to close the album.<br /><br />Once you end the album all the messages in the songs come together into one and you can really here the cry for the great state of California that they love and how it has gone so far down hill. And in the end The Battle Of Los Angeles is an amazing album by on eof the greatest rock bands of all time.song.

0399230033|2.0|We got this book for my son's 1st birthday.  I *thought* a certain friend I will call A gave it to us.      I didn't like this book when my son was one, but blamed it on his not-so-strong interest in books at the time.  As time passed, and he grew to LOVE being read to, I still didn't like this book because there are VERY few words to it.  It's mostly pictures and you have to talk about the pictures and I just don't care for that.  Part of reading to your child is having them learn to follow along and recognize words, and that just doesn't happen with this book.    Anyway time passed and \\"A\\" and I were at the bookstore together and she happened to see this book on the shelf and said, \\"I hate this book!\\"  I was like, \\"Why on earth did you give it to me then?\\"    Turns out she didn't.  I still don't know who did.      I would never buy this book for anyone.  It annoys me.  I want words!    The pictures are kind of cute but this book is a dud in my opinion.  I can't give it just ONE star though because my son does ask for it occasionally, so if he likes it a little, I have to give it a little credit.  But all in that, that inch of shelf space it takes up could be put to better use.

0618680004|5.0|This book summarises well the arguments for not believing in any of the various 'Gods' that different civilisations have developed in primitive times. <br /> <br />It is probably the most important book written in the past decade. <br /> <br />I am not a primitive man (I hope) and so I will like any sensible reasonably well educated person use the benefits of science and learning to base my life. <br /> <br />I daresay if I were a person born 5000 yrs ago and so a hunter, farmer or mother subject to nature, knowing so little about the world, I daresay I too would have beleieved in these various Gods. <br /> <br />Being born today I have to accept education and science we have learnt these past 5000 yrs.
B00005Y228|5.0|On the strength of her radio hit \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" Kylie Minogue had a hit album with this 2002 release. Fever is an addictive spin as Kylie offers a great collection of dance tunes filled with modern, techno beats laced with a disco groove. Her vocals drizzle with a sensuality heard before by the likes of Madonna and Debbie Harry. And the songs themselves are the perfect backdrop for your next house party, an evening of passionate romance, or working out.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|(\\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" by Arctic Monkeys)<br /><br />I suppose that Ray Davies and Paul Weller both still think they \\"invented\\" the most criticallly acclaimed, and therefore overhyped British band of the last decade (I mean, didn't they?).  It's also a little late in the game to keep blathering on about the post-punk revival.  Yes, Arctic Monkeys have fallen victim to all of the above, so when it came time for them to prove their worth, many predicted a smug, self-satisfied \\"I told you so,\\" followed immediately by a career nose dive that would make Oasis look like, um, the Beatles.  It's pleasant news that instead the lads have come back with a new album that, while superficially not much different from their debut, is in many ways better.<br /><br />Starting off with the propulsive, exhilirating \\"Brainstorm,\\" [[ASIN:B000NQR7NO Favourite Worst Nightmare]] shows a band determined not to take themselves too seriously, but at the same time prove the mean it, man.  While it's tempting to dismiss them as a bunch of too-young-for-their-own-good flash in the pan, theise monkeys have definitely evolved.  The twin guiar interplay of Alex Turner and Jamie Cook is shiite hot, new bassist Nick O'Malley keeps their wildly changing songs solid, and drummer Matt Helders deserves some sort of special award--his style is both fluid and precise, not to mention flexible; the softer songs here are every bit as exciting as the rockers.  While the album as a whole finds them moving more sharply away from punk, that doesn't mean they sound stodgy.  If a band like the Rolling Stones had allowed punk to reinvigorate their sound, they might have sounded a little like the Monkeys do now.<br /><br />Turner's Lyrics are better than ever--filled with internal rhymes and asides, he makes excess verbiage sound natural (that's one of the reasons music writers lionize the band--they kind of see Turner as a kindred spirit).  The finely wrought tales of nightlife from their debut have given way to detailed character studis and even satire.  \\"Brainstorm\\" is about a vain man named Brian: \\"And I wonder/Are you putting us under/'Cos we can't take our eyes off his t-shirt/And ties combination.\\" \\"Old Yellow Bricks,\\" with its sharp melody and new-wavy keyboards (my personal \\"favourite nightmare\\" on the album), mixes metaphors about \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and Harry Houdini to describe a transition to adulthood: \\"Houdini look, you don't know what you're running away from/He wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up/Blinded by nostalgia...\\" concluding \\"but Dorothy was right though.\\"  Other songs, like the wittily titled \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" continue on this theme.  With this album, Arctic Monkeys realize it's time to grow up, but still find playing to be too much fun.  Listening is just about as good.udis and even satire.  \\"Brainstorm\\" is about a vain man named Brian: \\"And I wonder/Are you putting us under/'Cos we can't take our eyes off his t-shirt/And ties combination.\\" \\"Old Yellow Bricks,\\" with its sharp melody and new-wavy keyboards (my personal \\"favourite nightmare\\" on the album), mixes metaphors about \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and Harry Houdini to describe a transition to adulthood: \\"Houdini look, you don't know what you're running away from/He wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up/Blinded by nostalgia...\\" concluding \\"but Dorothy was right though.\\"  Other songs, like the wittily titled \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" continue on this theme.

B000NVL9FQ|5.0|From the booming bass that kicks off \\"The Barbarian\\" through the final Moog synth squiggle of the \\"Lucky Man\\" outro,\\"Emerson Lake & Palmer\\" is the powerful opening salvo of ELP's mixture of classical,jazz and hard rock-best known to the world as \\"progressive rock\\"-that presented such obscure classical pieces as Bela Bartok's 'Allegro Barbaro'(\\"The Barbarian\\") and Janacek's 'Sinfonietta'(\\"Knife-Edge\\")in fresh contexts.Other highlights-on an album featuring nothing BUT highlights- include Greg Lake's 12 minute-plus epic \\"Take A Pebble\\" and Carl Palmer's fusion-esqe drum piece \\"Tank\\".This record has been remastered on CD a few times,first on the dismal-sounding Atlantic one from the 80's,and again on the Victory and Rhino in the 90's which,while an improvement from the first one,were pretty below the standards of most remasters from that period.This Shout! remaster(done by Andy Pearce at Masterpiece London)is right in the class of the Yes Rhino remasters and the Genesis CD/SACD/DVD hybrid's,with Lake's bass guitar sounding big and beefy,Palmer's drum work crisp,and Keith Emerson's keyboards as clear as pure mountain water.Despite the lack of bonus tracks,ELP and prog-rock fans should not hesitaite in picking up-or upgrading with-this reasonably-priced remastered jewel.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I love Avril. I love that she writes and produces all her own songs, started off songwriting and released her 1st album at such an early age. \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" Is just as good as the 1st album \\"Let GO\\" but perhaps better. She has grown, she enjoyed the success of \\"Let GO\\" and then released \\"Under My Skin\\" This album was terrific, but didn't sell as good, people thought, she was trying to be somone out of her skin when in reality this is who she is. And it suits her just fine. So she went back to writing and singing songs like when she 1st hit the scene. You have to appreciate Avril, she has some serious balads. \\"Keep Holding On\\" is just as Beautiful as the song she wrote that Kelly Clarkson sang \\"BreakAway\\"...<br />Go ahead and get this album and sit down pull out the lyrics and read along to her new songs, and you will crack up and bang your head to her catchy tunes.<br />I did...<br />I also enojyed the Bonus DVD. She might be married, but she is live and vivacious!  ROCK ON AVRIL!!!
B000O178BY|3.0|Trent reznor and nine inch nails have been running on fumes for the better part of a decade. He was a groundbreaking artist with his industrial sound. WAS is the operative word. Don't kid yourself and think something like Head Like a Hole is going to jump out at you on this tired new release. To his credit the CD sounds great. He gets four stars for his clever marketing campaign. His future outlook is one of nihilism and corruption. I can't argue with that. Here's what is missing: Musical innovation! Tunes have never been his strong suit. There are other artists/songwriters that put him to shame in this genre (Jon Crosby of VAST is a better musician, singer and tunesmith). Production innovation and thought provoking concepts are what made Reznor important. The concepts on this album range from corrupt politicans (Capitol G) to religon (God Given) and then on to enviromental concerns (Survivalism). The brooding Me, I'm Not reminds the listener of Closer and that's the problem. It's 2007, and while this cd is better than most of the year's releases, it's not a step forward for Reznor. I expect more from Mr. Reznor. Sorry folks, I call em like I see (or hear) em...
B00005JPP6|5.0|If you loved Shawn of the Dead, I have no doubt that you will love this film as well. It was a fascinating film, a little creepy, and more than hilarious. It was total fun!  <br /> <br />Beware that like Shawn of the Dead there was a lot of violence involved and one kindof graphic decapitation scene, no worse than a Highlander film in that respect and like Highlander totally fun. This film is not exactly child friendly but if the child is old enough take them and make it a family event. They will have fun. I know I did.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and one of the best I have seen lately. Initially I was attracted by the Jackman-Bale combination but the movie was stunning even when those two were not on the screen. <br />It is one the most frightening stories in a non-bloody fashion as after all, there is remarcably little blood on the scene. But the realization of what limits a human being can go to - and over- in search of satisfaction of its desire for fame, its curiosity and perverse courage - is chilling. <br />David Bowie is perfect as Tesla who plays his demonic role to perfection. He is in himself a force of nature and - like all Lucifer gifts - his gift to Angier gives much more than was asked for - and also demands an exorbitant price. <br />When you realize what Angier is doing with his last brilliant trick and what he is ready to live through for his moment of \\"prestige\\", it leaves you chilled to the bone. <br />Absolutely brilliant and highly recommended if you prefer a slow building of tension and elegant horrors of the mind and character rather than MTV-style action scenes.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|`Copying Beethoven' released in '06 is a thought provoking and somewhat contemplative exploration into the soul of one of the greatest composers of all time, Ludwig van Beethoven. While director Aqnieszka Holland fails in matching the emotional impact and visual grandeur of `Amadeus' or capturing the poetic nuances and exquisite melancholy of `Modigliani' it does succeed in providing the viewer with an insightful look into the sometimes tender, more often times volatile relationship between the musical genius and his copyist and muse Anna Holtz.<br /><br />Ed Harris and Diane Kruger are magical together in the starring roles of Ludwig and Anna and it's a good thing they are because they literally are the movie. Fortunately their on-screen chemistry is successful and observing their relationship as it grows deeper and more profound is a joy to behold.<br /><br />`Copying Beethoven' is a story of genius, isolation, longing and relationship with a subtle thread of spirituality intertwined throughout examining the nature of God and the ultimate meaning of life. Recommended viewing.
0743201140|4.0|This book is a great follow on to Marcus Buckingham's 'First Break All the Rules'.  With the father of Strengths Psychology Donald Clifton, these authors help you uncover your raw talents and help you understand how to apply them in your every day work as well as how to compensate for weaknesses.  The section on how to manage your team's strengths is most valuable.  However to benefit from this section you must purchase a Strengthsfinder book for every team member.  Is this an underhanded way to sell books?  I think offering a fee service for the on-line test might be more reasonable.  The book would still be valuable for team members, it's just unclear if they would choose to read it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I have bought several of these DVD Seasons for young people in my family.  Veronica Mars is a very worthy show to get any young person involved in.  The shows deal with issues ranging from everyday high school problems to serious crimes.  The themes are real problems that kids deal with and don't talk about.  All issues are handled tastefully and never crude or over the top.  This is an excellent show for any young person lacking confidence, struggling or just being a normal kid.  The female roles in the show are exemplary: strong, confident and real. I recommend it for everyone.
0780021967|5.0|While vacationing in London, Canadian Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) attends a theatre and watches the amazing memory man recollect extraordinary facts and pass on information on a wide and eclectic range of subjects.  The performance is chaotically interrupted.  Hannay makes the acquaintance of a beautiful woman named Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim).  Smith accompanies Hannay to his current residence and reveals to him that she is a secret agent that is trying to escape from a band of foreign agents that want her dead.  She tells Smith about a secret organization known as The 39 Steps, that she is traveling to Scotland, and to be on guard for a man who is missing half of one of his fingers.  That night, Annabella is murdered.  Hannay fears for his life and sets out on a journey to prove his innocence by discovering the secret of the 39 Steps and breaking up the spy ring.  A random series of encounters brings Hannay in contact with a beautiful, young woman named Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) who finds herself first unwittingly and then unwilling joining Hannay on his quest.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest film directors of all time.  His influence upon the medium is even greater than that of Orson Welles.  Hitchcock started making films in the 1920s and a person can learn a great deal about the medium of film and how to tell a story by just studying his early pictures.<br /><br />THE 39 STEPS isn't the best of Hitchcock's films, but it is a great example of how good a director he was.  While watching the movie I was reminded of the pacing from an Agatha Christie story (though in fact, the movie is based on the novel by Scottish author John Buchan).  The film is set in the era of Pre-WWI U.K., but other than the obvious changes in props and backgrounds could just as easily take place in the early 21st Century.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE 39 STEPS.  The film is kind of an action-spy-thriller piece, but it's full of delightful humor (such as when Hannay and Pamela are handcuffed together).  The movie is noted as being the film that got Robert Donat recognized as a serious actor by the Hollywood establishment.  It's also known as a great example of Hitchcock's penchant for realism:  Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll actually were handcuffed together for several hours because Hitchcock claimed to have lost the key (in actuality he had given it to a security guard for \\"safekeeping\\").<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys watching good spy films and for anyone who is a fan of Hitchcock.  Also, if you're picking up this film to own, buy the Criterion Collection version.  Other versions are much less expensive but Criterion has the best version of the movie available on DVD.dcuffed together).

0553062182|5.0|The author says \\"there are more non-HSP's than HSP's, possibly because non-HSP's are more likely to get themselves killed, so therefore we need more non-HSP's\\". (HSP's are a lot more careful and cautious.)<br /><br />HSP = Highly Sensitive Person<br /><br />The author explains how both non-HSP's and HSP's are important to society. Society needs both. Both non-HSP's and HSP's have their specific talents and roles and functions. The world needs both in order to properly function. It also explains that neither is better than the other - they both have advantages and disadvantages. Just whichever one God chooses for you to be is what you will be.<br /><br />Yes, the book does explain the technical scientific facts, but that is for only if you are interested. If you are not interested in the scientific reasoning, it also explains everything in practical language.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite part of the book: It says that it has been medically proven that HSP's actually have more \\"feelers\\" on their brain (I don't remember the scientific term), and that is why they are so sensitive. A lot of people think HSP's are wrong or terrible for being so sensitive - but they have a medical reason for being that way.<br /><br />Some examples of my sensitivity are: 1) When I walk into a restaurant, I can smell strong aromas (whether they are good or bad), but nobody else can smell a thing. 2) When someone does certain things (such as pick their teeth, blow their nose, etc), I lose my appetite and can't eat for a while, but everybody else can eat as if nothing ever happened. 3) Music brings out deep sentimental feelings for me, more so than for the average person. 4) When I walk into someone's house who has an animal, I can smell an odor, and I lose my appetite, but nobody else smells anything, and they can still eat. 5) When someone has surgery, or takes a trip, or does anything that can cause an accident, I am deeply concerned about their safety and well-being, while the average person thinks nothing, or very little, of it. 6) I cannot go into the pet store at the mall, nor the clothing store that is next to the pet store, because the odor from the pet store gags me. On the other hand, I can pick up natural smells and enjoy them and appreciate them a lot more than the average person - two of my favorites are magnolia and honeysuckle.<br /><br />One major disadvantage for me is that I take a long time to get over things (for example: loss or death). My non-HSP friends get over loss and death and other things very quickly (and sometimes it never bothers them at all).<br /><br />This book is totally awesome - it tells us that we are normal.

B00005O5CM|4.0|Despite it's superficial gloss it really is a wonderful movie. The casting is great, especially Selma Blair's drop-jaw performance as her rival who later becomes her friend; the way the title character who invests all her dreams in a man goes out to become studied to win him and then decides that she's better off without him anyway. The way innocence sometimes is able to accomplish things in a laconic manner that the pretentious are not able to. All these things speak of universal truths down through the centuries dressed in pink shades of fluff that make it palatable for everyone. <br /> <br />I was impressed by not merely the fast pacing of the movie, but its ability to avoid dwelling on a cuteness that it's unashamed to promulgate and which it does packing socially astute observations; such as the scene with the shy lawyer being rebuffed by two enamoratas who are suddenly swayed by the fact that after all another woman gives him amorous currency.   <br /> <br /> The classroom scenes are fun too. All in all a well-made, fun film with a good message of empowerment for young women, and for everyone else for that matter.  <br /> <br />Frank
B000AJIF4E|3.0|The sound quality on these headphones is excellent for the price.  I use them at work to listen to music to drown out background noise and help me concentrate.  They remain comfortable for longer periods of time than other headphones I have owned.<br /><br />My problem with this product (the reason why I give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5) is that whenever I shift slightly in my seat, or sit up, it shocks the hell out of my ears!  I have never had any other headphones do this to me.  It really is very painful, to the point where I cringe every time I move while wearing them.  I'm sure this is maybe more the seat's fault than the headphones themselves.  But I eventually went back to my less comfortable headphones for listing to music at work, and have these hooked up to my digital piano at home (which sounds awesome).

Eric is backed by a good band here that includes the great Steve Gadd on drums and Muddy Waters former harmonica player Jerry Portnoy who adds some authentic blues flavor to several of the songs.     This DVD, which features excellent sound and picture quality, will please those who appreciate the blues side of Clapton. He avoids most of his commercial pop/rock material in this performance to focus on a nice selection of classic blues with a couple of Cream songs and solo hits thrown in. At least half the songs performed are blues standards, including several from his great 1994 album From the Cradle.     Eric belts out a powerful version of the Elmore James classic \\"It hurts me too\\" that spotlights his ability on the slide guitar. \\"Five long years\\" is another highlight of the show where he and the band let loose with some hot blues solos, and Clapton also includes a two-song tribute to legendary bluesman Freddie King with \\"I'm Tore Down\\" and the great slow blues \\"Have you ever loved a woman\\". While Eric Clapton is a legend in the world of rock music, this concert is further proof that the blues is where he really shines the most.     Anyone who enjoys Eric's guitar playing in this concert needs to check out another great DVD called \\"Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session\\". This is a superb 1985 special that features Clapton rocking out like never before with Carl Perkins, George Harrison, and others. See my review for that DVD which I recommend even more than this one!
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Little Mermaid is my personal favorite when it comes to Disney movies. I love having it on DVD and the bonus features are extensive. I would normally rate this 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed with the cover art. I'm a fan of hand-drawn animation. The cover is very obviously a computer generated version of characters. I wish the cover art matched the animation of the movie. Ariel just doesn't look right. Yes, I agree, this isn't a big deal...but it bugs me a little. However, I still am happy I purchased it!
0743298020|5.0|Even if you haven't read Jane Eyre, you'll still be able to follow the twisting plot of this book.  But if you have read Jane Eyre, and especially if you love Jane Eyre, then you'll appreciate the homage this book is to the gothic gem.  A governess, a tragic fire, the moors, a lunatic secretly housed in a scary old house - many elements of Bronte's classic picked up, rearranged, and deposited back into this spellbinding book.<br /><br />The premise of the story is this:  internationally revered (yet notoriously reclusive) author Vida Winter has contacted quiet bookseller and amateur biographer Margaret Lea to write the scoop of the century - a \\"truthful\\" telling of Ms. Winter's life story.  Margaret has her own reasons for wanting to refuse - namely, that she herself is pretty reclusive - but upon reading one of Ms. Winter's books for the first time in her life, Margaret is entranced by the woman's power over words.  What kind of life could feed such talent?  And why hasn't Ms. Winter shared the truth of it before?<br /><br />Margaret accepts the invitation and joins Ms. Winter at her grand, dark estate on the moors.  At this point in the novel, with the dictation of Winter's story to Margaret, Setterfield begins to weave together the landscapes of the past and the present - the stichings of Ms. Winter's life and Margaret's own knowledge of love, loss, and the concept of \\"truth.\\"  I appreciated the smooth transitions between the two worlds - many authors have been less successful with this approach.  But there was nothing jarring or contrived about how the perspectives and stories switched back and forth; it was seemless and offered much in terms of a deeper revelation into the story.<br /><br />Three plot devices did distract me a bit from the beauty of the writing and the quality of the story.  First and second:  ghost and twin.  Both of these themes are intrinsic to the understanding of this book, but I did feel that Setterfield laid it on a bit thick (just my opinion).  A little less could have gone a lot further with me.  And third:  the unsettling relationship between a brother in the sister was, well, unsettling.  I made my peace with that by recognizing there was nothing descriptive or graphic whatsoever in describing their relationship - it was all inference and innuendo.  Still, not my favorite part of the story.<br /><br />This book is drama and mystery and suspense.  Darkness and whispers.  Labyrinthine garden and hallways.  It is also, ultimately, about family and yearning for love.  And, I think, about second chances.  The writing is beautiful and offers a lovely ode to booklovers of all shapes and sizes.  Setterfield's Margaret asks rhetorically, \\"Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you?  You leave the previous book with ideas and themes - characters even - caught in the fibers of your clothes, and when you open the new book, they are still with you.\\"  I would answer to Margaret, yes, I know exactly how that feels.  This time thanks to your creator.my opinion).  A little less could have gone a lot further with me.  And third:  the unsettling relationship between a brother in the sister was, well, unsettling.

0156012197|5.0|It was children's book week last week at the public library, and they had a huge display of staff favorites.  So when I entered the door, The Little Prince was waiting right there for me.  I must confess, I have never read this book in its entirety.  Such a classic, and I have only known about the sound bytes - one of the most famous being the quote, \\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\"  Who knew it is a fox that actually says that in the book?<br /><br />The story opens with a pilot stranded in the desert.  A pilot, who when he was younger, was dissuaded from pursuing his real passion:  drawing.  As a consequence, he only knows how to draw a boa from the inside and a boa from the outside.  But back to his being stranded in the desert.  While trying to fix his plane, he meets the Little Prince.  This Prince is from a planet that is quite small, with just one flower and three volcanoes (one being inactive, but you never know).  On his planet, he can see the sun set anytime he wants to, just by shifting the position of his chair.  The Prince sets out to explore the other planets around him, and in retelling his tale, we get to meet all the interesting people he has met.  The Prince's final conclusion after all his interviews with strangers on new planets:  \\"Grown-ups are so strange.\\"  They don't understand anything \\"important,\\" he determines - all they care about is numbers (and other such nonsense).<br /><br />It is on the last planet he visits - Earth - that the Little Prince meets the fox.  This is my favorite part of the story.  It is when the Prince learns about being \\"tamed,\\" or really, I suppose, being loved (and loving in return).  The whole section with the fox was really beautiful, and is the source of the famous quote above.  The fox tells the Prince about what is essential, and explains \\"One sees clearly only with heart.\\"  He also explains that it is the time we spend on others that makes them valuable to us, that grows the love between us.  It's wonderful.<br /><br />The end of the story is bittersweet.  The major theme I took from this section is how precious memories can be, and how the world is made more alive by the people and the love we associate with everything on earth.  It's not a new idea, but just beautifully put.  There are songs that remind me of others and make me smile.  Smells, sights, everything.<br /><br />The staff member who chose this book for the display wrote as her reasoning for the choice:  \\"It reminds me to look at things as if I'd never looked at them before.\\"  I echo that sentiment.  And I believe it's a lesson we could all bear to learn.It's wonderful. <br /> <br />The end of the story is bittersweet.

B000001EGE|4.0|I have the greatest admiration and affection for Elton John. He has tackled and conquered most styles of music with great success.  HONKY CHATEAU is his fifth album, released in May 1972.  I hope to review all his seventies albums and this is the first I drew \\"out of the hat\\".    After his two previous albums which were artistic, but not commercial triumphs, Elton went for the larger audience with HONKY CHATEAU and created a more pop orientated album, without sacrficing his artistic ideals.  He started to shake off the obsession with the American Wild West and sang about more modern subjects.  Americana is atill in evidence especially on HONKY CAT, SLAVE, MONA LISAS AND MAD HATTEERS and ROCKET MAN but it is more varied. Nothing wrong with that as I  was getting tired of hearing about people labelled as \\"guns\\" in his previous albums.  The seeds of what can be described as Elton's band, Nigel Olsson, Davey Johnstone and Dee Murray originated here and they were the core of musicians during Elton's golden period in the early and mid 70's. Even Ray Cooper plays on some tracks.    The cover is one of the most misleading I have seen.  Who is that bearded, serious guy?  Surely a better cover could have been deivsed.  Anyway to the album itself. I would like to give it 4.5 stars but am not allowed by the rating system. Song titles are followed by the song time.    It kicks off with HONKY CAT (5.13). I haven't heard Elton having this much fun since he sang THE CAGE on his self-titled album which was three albums previous. This is a great song with great Taupin lyrics. Definitely one of my favourites.      Next is MELLOW (5.32).  This one I can skip although most reviewrs consider it a highlight. I like the verse but not the chorus and it goes on too long. On of my peeves with artists is songs that go on longer than they should.  This is one of them. Too many chorus repeats.    Song 3 is I THINK I\\"M GOING TO KILL MYSELF (3.34). This is very light-hearted and not to be taken seriously.  Just listen to the arrangement! Honky-tonk piano, tap dancing and spoons. Sounds like a big spoof.     SUSIE (DRAMAS) (3.24). Another favourite and it is the first gutsy song on the album. The Dramas part escapes me and is not necessary. BLACK-EYED SUSIE would have been a better song title.     Then comes ROCKET MAN (4.41). One of Elton's biggest hits. Great tune, great vocal, great arrangement but some of the lyrics are lazy especially in Verses 3 and 4. \\"Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids. In fact it's cold as hell\\" are two wonderful lines but what follows \\"and there's no-one there to raise them if you did\\" doesn't make much sense\\". The next verse about \\"it's just my job five days a week, a rocket man\\" etc is also a letdown.    The next two songs: SALVATION (3.58) and SLAVE (4.20) are the two most dismissed songs by other reviewers. SALVATION is quit a nice song with a gospel feel to it but I think SLAVE is a highlight.  It has a very laid back whimsical feel to it although the lyrics are on the angry side and it is rare on an Elton song that the keyboards take a back seat. Great acoustic guitar, country guitar and banjo all played by Davey Johnstone!     AMY (4.03) is probably the weirdest song on the album and one of Elton's most unique songs in that there is no tune!.  You cannot sing or whistle it but that is why I like it.  Very odd lyrics but I love the line \\"Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams\\".  Aslo listen to the bizarre electric violin played by Jean-Luc Ponty!    MONA LISAS AND MAD HATTERS (5.00) gets the most praise and it does hit the nail on the head about New York City. My only problem is that it cries out for a third verse and not an amalgamation of Verses 1 + 2. I feel the song is over half-way through and it has nothing to say for the last two minutes. Sorry for going against the grain of thinking. But it is my one main gripe about Elton John in that some songs could be shorter. TINY DANCER, MY FATHER\\"S GUN, BENNIE AND THE JETS and SOMEONE SAVED MY LIFE TONIGHT are other examples.    Last song is HERCULES (5.20) which is a lot of fun and ends the album on a fun singalong note!  Obscure lyrics again from Bernie. I can just about glean from the words that it is about a girl in love with a muscle boy but the words incorporate much more that I cannot fathom.     There is also a bonus track, a fast rocking version of SLAVE(2.51) which is worth listening to but the album version is much better.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|According to the dictionary \\"babel\\" is a confusion of sounds or voices. If everyone is talking then nobody is listening. If nobody listens, then there is no communication. So, in BABEL the movie, we have a set of three tenuously linked stories about communication or the lack thereof. One character is even a Japanese deaf mute teenage girl. (How is that for artistic symbolism?) Two other characters are an American husband (Brad Pitt) and wife (Kate Blanchard) who are on a trip in Morocco and not talking to each other. A Moroccan peasant father cannot seem to communicate with his sons and daughter. In the United States, the American couple's Hispanic nanny can't seem to communicate with her impulsive young relative. Another theme is the evil of guns, in this case a hunting rifle and the consequences its criminally improper use creates. A second gun incident is tragically involved in the story of the deaf mute. So we get the feeling this film has anti-gun propaganda aspects to it which is not surprising from Hollywood liberal film makers. That said, BABEL is an entertaining if starkly realistic and gritty film with fine acting turns by all involved. Rinko Kikuchi is excellent as the Japanese girl and stole the film in my opinion. I don't know if BABEL is brilliantly conceived or even superbly directed; the division into three barely connected stories feels disjointed. CRASH did a better job with that approach to story telling. But BABEL is worth seeing and listening to.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I was introduced to this album by my brother and was not sure if I would like it as I grew up in the seventies and was therefore somewhat out of touch with today's artists. But from the opening notes of HONEY, I was hooked.  Moby put together a wonderful collection of songs for this album, most of which are instantly memorable, covering rock, pop, ambient music, gospel and ballads. Eighteen songs is a lot for one album and maybe four could have been left off: DOWN SLOW and 7 are very short, almost snippets.  The spoken tracks: IF THINGS WERE PERFECT and THE SKY IS BROKEN are irritating and I tend to skip them. My other criticism is that the best tracks are contained in the first half of the album and it tends to run out of steam after RUN ON.  So maybe a differnet playing order would have held my interest better. But that is only a minor complaint as there are so many wonderful tracks.    PORCELAIN may be overplayed as I see it listed on most chillout albums, including PURE MOODS 3 but there is no denying it is a great song.      SOUTHSIDE is the other big hit but it does not really need Gwen Stefani's guest vocal (although I do think she is a great artist).     Ater reading most of the other reviews, WHY DOES MY HEART FEEL SO BAD? seems to be the favourite song on the album and deservedly so. Very emotional vocal and a great gospel-style arrangement.      MACHETE and BODYROCK are the two most hard-edged songs on the album. BODYROCK has gotten a lot of airplay and is full of memorable hooks with its \\"Rock ya'll, no stop ya'll\\" lyric. MACHETE is a full-throttle, no holding back track. As far away from PORCELAIN as you could possibly get!!    RUN ON is another gospel style song that shows Moby's religious side; nicely understated with grerat backing vocal.     The third gospel type song is NATURAL BLUES. This has to be one of Moby's most confessional songs, questioning his faith and his \\"troubles with God\\". Along with WHY DOES MY HEART FEEL SO BAD, this has got to bethe standout track on the album.  His voice is full of naked, vulnerable anguish.    RUSHING is another favourite. It starts off as a lovely simple tune and then bursts out with gorgeous piano arpeggios that show Moby's talent as a gifted pianist. There is a magical moment all the other instrumentation suddenly stops and the piano is left \\"hanging\\".      EVERLOVING and GUITAR FLUTE & STRING are very effective mood pieces. Done in an acoustic arrangement, there is absolutetly no techno or studio wizardry involved.  They are beautiful, raw and very soulful.      How can you not love HONEY! Very simple, almost ameteurish at the start but it is three and a half minutes of pure infectious pop.    Other tracks like MY WEAKNESS (interesting, but sort of ho-hum), FIND MY BABY (repetitive like HONEY and WHY DOES MY HERAT... but this track does need more variation) and INSIDE (too long and the album's longest track) are O.K. but nothing special.    By the way skip the liner notes. Moby pours forth about his beliefs on various topics and I for one don't really care. I am interested in some of the issues he talks about but it does come accross as a little bit preachy.  Just create more great music.  Below are track listing and times.  Some have an A+ rating to show my favourites.    Track listing:  1.   Honey  3.27                         (A+)                         2.   Find my baby  3.58                   3.

B00080ZG10|5.0|\\"The Aviator\\" carries more similarities with earlier Martin Scorsese's masterpiece -- \\"The Raging Bull\\" -- than might be obvious at first viewing. Both the aviator and film producer Howard Hughes (Leonardo di Caprio) and the boxing pro champ Jake LaMotta (Robert de Niro in the 1980 movie) achieved much in their lives, but were prevented to reach even higher heights -- partly due to their own mistakes, partly due to circumstances that were against them. But the most striking similarity between the two films lies in the way Scorsese masterfully injected them with understated compassion with the characters -- Interestingly, even the names of the two Scorsese's favorite actors are similarly Italian. <br /> <br />There are some differences, too. While Jake LaMotta's demons are an integral part of the film and its events, Howard Hughes' mental illness does not really carry the film forward and is the main reason why \\"The Aviator\\" feels a little too long. But not too long, rest assured. You can devour it, time flies with it -- so irresistibly watchable this is. Also due to the stellar cast headed by di Caprio. And the word to Cate Blanchett -- when Katharine Hepburn, so far the only actress (or actor, for that matter) who owns 4 acting Oscars, passed away at 96 in 2003, it could not occur to many that in just a year there will be such a great incarnation of HERSELF on film. <br /> <br />Blanchett earned the Oscar of her own for this role and the film got four more statues, but the most prestigious ones went to Clint Eastwood's sombre and more intimate \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Indeed, \\"The Aviator\\" has not as high emotional resonance as some other big prize winners and as such does not stay with you for days after you see it, but solely for its sheer, classy filmmaking craft it easily ranks among the best works of the century so far.

B000001ESP|5.0|man, 262 reviews for this CD?!? I don't remember if I reviewed it before but so what. If Rush never recorded another CD after this their place as one of the all time great progressive rock bands is already secure. I have had the absolute pleasure of seeing Rush perform 5 times and they remain one of the best live bands I have ever seen.<br />The production on this CD superb as is the playing. Neil Peart has influenced countless drummers, including myself, and his playing on this is tight, crisp, and clean. The track TOM SAWYER is a classic and Neil really shines on that track. Sometimes it's hard to believe it's only 3 guys in the band but each one is a superb musician. This is one of Rush's must-have discs. Their RUSH IN RIO dvd is also highly recommended. Add these two babies to your prog rock collection. Ignore at your own risk!<br /><br />[...]
B00005JPAO|5.0|There is one main reason to see this film: HELEN MIRREN! She's fabulous! I missed it in the theaters but it plays beautifully on a home screen - even my 27 inch one. The wide screen is not as wide as many others and so the picture shows up well.<br /><br />Especially for baby boomers who remember watching the young Elizabeth being crowed Queen on a small black and white TV set in the early 1950s, this film shows us the mature and intelligent and yet cold looking monarch that she is. As we learn in the short 17-minute \\"making of\\" documentary, it was not Direct Frears concern that the actors playing Tony Blair and Prince Charles actually look or sound like the real characters. At first you miss Charles large ears but pretty soon you hear what is a good characterization of his voice.<br /><br />On the surface this is a story of the tragic death of Princess Diana but, below that surface is the story of what it is like to be raised in a Palace and be cut off from the modern world.<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks as well. One is by Direct Stephen Frears and talks about the making of the film. The other is by a British Historian who discusses the making of a Monarchy and Royal customs.<br /><br />Most of all, however you will remember the great performance of Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br /><br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

Boola Moon is something you'll recognize as something from the depths of our collective subconscious; or that part of our brain where our dreams (or nightmares) are born.

0895260131|5.0|I initially purchased this book as an additional to get free shipping from one of the online book stores I use. Little did I know I was getting one of the best books I've read on Islam. <br /> <br />Robert Spencer has produced a well documented, well researched book, despite the title. He pulls information from a variety of sources including the source book of all Islam, the Qur'an. <br /> <br />The Politically Incorrect Guide(tm) to Islam (and the Crusades) is divided into three major sections; Islam, The Crusades, Today's Jihad. <br /> <br />In the first section, Islam, Spencer starts with the beginnings of Islam with a close look at Muhammad, drawing on the the information found in the Qur'an and in the official Islamic histories of Muhammad. He then proceeds to look at the Qur'an and what it teaches concerning war, jihad and the position of non-Muslims. Spencer also looks at Islamic (Sharia) law and what it promotes for non-Muslims (dhimma), women, and morals. He concludes section one with an analysis of myths about Islam being promoted by the politically correct factions in the western world. <br /> <br />The middle section, The Crusades, takes an unblinking look at the reasons behind the Crusades, the wrongs committed, and the whitewashing of the history of the Crusades by modern historians and film makers. <br /> <br />The last part of the book, Today's Jihad, shows that the jihad which was started more than 1400 years ago continues today. Spencer points out how that Islam is becoming an untouchable religion in Western law. To criticize Islam is to promote hatred. To quote the Qur'an as proof of the Islamic edict to pursue war against \\"unbelievers\\", or as proof of its approval of the oppression of women will just get you tossed into prison as in the case of Daniel Scot in Australia in 2004 (which is mentioned in chapter 17). <br /> <br />Spencer also shows how the leaders of Islam are actively pursuing the installation of Sharia law in all countries where Muslims are present, including the United States, Britain, Canada and all other Western nations. <br /> <br />It is worthy of note that Robert Spencer is listed as living \\"in a secure, undisclosed location\\". <br /> <br />If there is a book you are going to read on Islam, I highly recommend this one.

Instead of creating compelling characters, great dialogue, and a moving plotline, Sagan's Contact is filled with government and science community hearings that go on forever and ever.<br /><br />Almost every character and every plot and character point in the book is different from the movie--but the movie is infinitely better.<br /><br />For one, you cannot follow who is who nor are able to understand enough about any characters (sometimes even Ellie) to even connect name to information about them.  Ellie, for example, never developes a relationship of any depth with Palmor Joss.  In fact, Joss is a very minor character in Sagan's version, a lesser religious figure opposed to the machine.  Instead, she's in love with Der Herr (whoever that really is?) and has a live-in relationship with him.<br /><br />The machine has five people who go, not just Ellie.<br /><br />Even Hadden is different and far less important than he is in the movie.<br /><br />This would be okay if Sagan's work was well written and sound as a piece of fiction.  But it's not.  it's confusing, hard to follow, and just not very well constructed.  The characters are flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />I found reading this book a chore.<br /><br />I gave it away to a used book store as soon as I finished reading it!
B000O75F7C|3.0|I am so, so disappointed with this release. I find myself wondering what Wilson et al were doing that led to this-- considering the sheer brilliance of the band evident in every other album. What went wrong?<br /><br />It's not a particular song that's grating, or the length of \\"Anesthesize\\", or any one particular element taken to unbearable extremes. It's simply that the entire album is deeply (and tragically) flawed. I wish I could understand how it came to this. I have always LOVED Porcupine Tree's work, and essentially believed they could do no wrong. Now, with Fear of a Blank Planet, I have to reassess that belief.<br /><br />I heard Porcupine Tree live a few months ago, and during the concert they demoed a few songs off of this album. They seemed alright--darker and certainly more minor-key than I was used to, with some odd harmonies, but I definitely didn't immediately find them exciting. As it turns out, the album is worse (to me) than I expected.<br /><br />\\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" opens with a decent, if repetitive, melody-- Wilson's vocals follow the same as the opening guitar, and very few things change over the 8 minutes of the piece. I admit it's relatively catchy, and for that reason I give it a better score than it probably deserves. It has energy, and movement, but somehow is completely passionless. In what seems to be the recurring problem with this album, this song most succinctly demonstrates the weakest link in the band--this is some truly BLAND, emotionless drumming. 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />\\"My Ashes\\" is a slow, ballad-type piece, akin perhaps to Heart Attack in a Layby or Gravity Eyelids, though it loses the amazing hard-rock edge of the latter or the emotionality of the former. The song just makes me sleepy, and due to its being so incredibly formulaic it seems to go absolutely nowhere. Where is the impact of this piece? You can't do a ballad if it isn't going to carry some kind of charge! I feel like the same lyrics are simply sung over andover again, and they aren't even very good. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />\\"Anesthetize\\" is the song most people are talking about (some even claiming it's PT's best song to date). I honestly can't understand the excitement. The intro is certainly fair, and decently composed, but excessively long (the first exciting drum part, where it gets more distorted and edgy, doesn't come in for 3 minutes). It definitely feels like the song is going somewhere, which is great (a rather nice guitar solo, though placed at a strange time in the overall unfolding of the track, adds a lot).  Suddenly, this weird techno beat materializes underneath a God-awful, horrendously repetitive guitar line (three notes over and over for about 2 minutes). When the band feels like it's had enough, they suddenly launch into a different riff--repeated over and over and over and over and over. None of this feels connected or organic in any way; nor is it \\"progressive rock\\". It's flat, repetitive, and entirely unneccessary. Wilson's vocals come back in--at the 7:20 mark(!!)-- and do little to redeem the track. \\"The dust in my soul makes me feel awake in my legs\\"? \\"I'm watching TV but I find it hard to stay conscious / I'm totally bored\\"... you know, there was a time when PT seemed like real social commentary, but every time Wilson sings about the evils of the modern world it loses its potency. The chorus, however, is actually quite good, and recalls such victorious moments as that of \\"Halo\\", \\"Trains\\" and \\"The Sound of Muzak\\". It's too bad that the first time we hear it is at the NINE MINUTE MARK. The guitar work, at this point, picks up a lot and becomes much more like the band we've come to love-- juicy, organic, exciting-- but soon devolves into soulless grinding (and another few repetitions of the chorus for good measure). Chug chug chugga chugga chug... Eventually, and for no readily apparent reason, the song slows way, way down and becomes lethargic and boring, saved only by a nice guitar solo at thevery end. One wonders why these weren't two separate pieces, or what they possibly had to do with each other... (3.5 out of 5)<br /><br />\\"Sentimental\\" is probably my favorite of the album. Haunting, beautifully composed, and intensely memorable. Wilson's vocals seem actually heartfelt, and overall the piece is just good songwriting. The chorus is exceptionally atmospheric and moving, recalling the very best of \\"In Absentia\\"-- my favorite PT album so far. It also never loses its momentum, moving naturally and seamlessly through an ACTUAL progression (\\"prog rock\\", anyone?) Feels like a companion to \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\".  There's even a hint of \\"Trains\\" played in a minor key... absolutely gorgeous. 4-4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />\\"Way Out of Here\\" is another solid song. I really dislike the techno sound PT is playing with (and this is weird coming from someone who digs electronic music) because it feels too artificial, but the piece is carried forward on its own momentum. I do feel like his using the word \\"iPod\\" in the song is just unnatural--not that I have anything against 'em (I had the first, Mac-only model), but it just seems strange to me to use product names in music. The song is very emotional, and recalls a lot of power-metal ballads-- none so much as The Cure, actually. Quite cool. And though the chorus is really nothing special, the guitar work is great. Unfortunately, for no reason (can you sense a pattern here?) it launches back into soulless \\"chugga chugga chug\\". I'm all for loud, aggressive sound in rock music, but this is simply uninteresting. Coming from a band as skilled as Porcupine Tree, I'm incredibly disappointed in this lack of creativity. (4 out of 5)<br /><br />\\"Sleep Together\\" is just terrible. Terrible. First off is that awful synth (did someone just load up a generic Reaktor preset?), which apparently is destined to lead the entire first minute of the piece. Throughout the first 1:40, Steve Wilson seems completely bored by his own voice, until finally he launches into what (I guess) is the \\"epic\\" part. \\"Let's sleep together / right now.\\" (moment of silence, please)... Surely we can do better than this? What a bad way to end an album... (2 out of 5).<br /><br />So, here's my deal. I love everything PT has ever done, because they showcase originality, concept, talent, wordplay, dynamics, and friggin' INCREDIBLE melodies in every album (and they sure have a lot). Here, they seem to have lost most of all those elements-- though hopefully they'll recover. The cover is absolutely beautiful, and probably my favorite (though I like In Absentia); I just wish the music measured up.<br /><br />I'm sure many people will love this album, but I am so scared that \\"Deadwing\\" was the end of the band I fell in love with...

B000MG1ZFQ|3.0|I don't quite know what to think about this remix/remaster.  On one hand, there is greater clarity and detail, the recording breathes, and the instruments are well defined in their own space.  On the other hand, it lacks fullness and warmth due to being lower-midrange deficient, and it is slightly bass-shy.  How many times are they going to sell this to me before they finally get it right?<br /><br />The remix is another issue: I have nothing against remixing classic titles when they try to duplicate the original mix in an effort to improve the overall sound quality.  I also don't have a problem when they remix to deliberately alter the music, but I'm not sure if they don't belong in a box set or as bonus tracks.  In this case, the only significant alteration occurs on the title track, and I don't care for it. Unfortunately it's not presented as a bonus track, but as a part of the original album.<br /><br />This smells like another attempt to simply sell us the same title again. All I want is an identical remix, remastered to sound as good as possible - but if they did that, I wouldn't have to buy it again!<br /><br />Edit 9-26-10: Audio Fidelity recently released an audiophile version of this, and it sounds quite good. There have been problems with their releases, and this one is no exception, but overall, it is definitely the one to buy.
1594200823|4.0|This is a very good book with excellent and enlightening information; the only drawback in my opinion is that at times it is written too far above the average reader's level of understanding as far as food and science is concerned. I am a culinary student and am very interested in this type of literature and information, and I bypassed some parts because I was not able to get through them due to the very specific scientifics. Overall, I definitely recommend it.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|You encounter a large puddle on the street one day.  What to do?  99 times out of 100, you step gingerly aside.<br /><br />So it is with most romantic comedies, stepping gingerly aside from the risk of cliche.  But this movie grins, steps back, and takes a running leap crashing down onto every single cliche known to modern romantic comedic entertainment.  Its like sitting in the front row at Sea World.  Initially, getting splashed and completely soaked (with foul tank water or cliches) doesn't feel so hot, but after a while you get into the show and everything is OK. So regarding the cliche smorgasbord, \\"The Holiday\\" is basically saying to us, \\"So what? Get over it.\\"<br /><br />Aside from its self confidence, the film has a several other redeeming characteristics. One of the cliches it does manage to avoid is the contrived conflict scene.  When the characters discover potentially disarming new things about their romantic interest, its a cause for a smile, not an angry rant.  The scene in the kids' tent was very sweet, real and well done.  The 3-way telephone scene.  Funny!  Showing the Jack Black character as a good person, who enjoys the company of the old gentlemen.  Well done.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz lost weight for this film, and showed up with her \\"A\\" game.  Otherwise, the casting didn't seem right.  Kate Winslet, seemed to have difficulty with some of the scenes attempting humor, such as the Jack Black scene in the video store.  Is she laughing or crying?  It was awkward. Jack Black as a romantic interest?  Ouch.  He is funny of coures, and you get the feeling he was the funniest when he forgot the script!  Did Kate have a clause in her contract to avoid physical contract with Jack (did they ever kiss)?  If she did, could you blame her? And Jude law, as the clean cut widower?  That casting seemed somewhat at odds with his real-life run-ins with fidelity.  Oh well.  Thats Hollywood!<br /><br />I would have given four stars, but that ending, with everyone jumping around the room being soooo happy, was like the grand finale at the end of the 4th of July fireworks - a huge, immense, massive, final cliche crescendo.<br /><br />In a way, it was the perfect ending for \\"The Holiday.\\"happy, was like the grand finale at the end of the 4th of July fireworks - a huge, immense, massive, final cliche crescendo.      In a way, it was the perfect ending for \\"The Holiday.\\"
0634060384|5.0|My jazz piano instructor recommended this book for me and I have found it very useful. Some complain that some of the pieces in it sound bad because some of them are rearranged. Well, I have not had any problems with that but some songs have been written with different chords from what they originally were. A prime example is the piece titled \\"Chelsea Bridege\\".  <br /> <br />Well this book contains so many pieces that you can use for a long time.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I didn't know if I could stomach another Star Trek series. I love the original of course, and TNG has its moments amidst its profound 90's Political correctness and horrific costumes, Picard is my third favorite captain. Deep Space nine failed to grab me, although I love those ferengi. Voyager is just embarrassing, Capt Janeway and the enormous bun, Tupac the black Vulcan, female klingon crewmember, 7 of Double D, it made me sick to my stomach. So when Enterprise came onto the scene, I rolled my eyes and expected another crew of insipid whiners and dull storylines, but I was wrong.<br /><br />Casting Scott Bakula was risky, seeing how he is associated with quantum leap, but it so works. The rest of the crew, Phlox, Tripp, Malcom, T'pol, Oshi, Mayweather all come together in such a symbiotic way, quite reminiscent of the original series and its crew, in fact I dare say, they are better together as a whole. I had my misgivings about the new theme music but its cheesiness grew on me like Barry Manilow singing Mandy. There is not one throw away episode, and there is so much life and love and just \\"good old\\" star trekiness in the whole first season. Some might Poo-poo on the small things like \\"klingons didn't look like that\\" and sneer at the logic of the writers, but they have to remember that IF the original series could have made the klingons look like what Roddenberry wanted them to , they would have, so why not honor his original idea? Don't turn your back on this wonderful series just because you are jaded, and have been to way too many conventions, live a little outside the Marriott. As for the Price? I think its worth it.
0743454537|5.0|This was my first try with a new author. I've never heard of her before though she is acknowledged as \\"the New York Times bestselling author\\" on the book itself. I will probably read another by her again but I think it might be a little bit before I try it. If all of her books are as emotionally charged as this one I'm going to need some recovery time. I will say that it was a page turner for me though; I read it in two nights at work. <br /> <br />The premise of this novel is that thirteen year old Anna has a sixteen year old sister, Kate, and Kate suffers from a rare form of leukemia. Anna can rattle off medical terms and procedures faster than most medical experts; not surprising since she's been the donor for Kate's numerous life-sustaining treatments since Anna was born. In fact, Anna was conceived as a perfect donor match for Kate--her first donation was the placenta, rich in stem cells. Now, Kate is in late stage renal failure and Anna is taking her parents to court for the right to make decisions about her own medical treatments. <br /> <br />I loved the turns this book takes at the end though I would have preferred a different ending. I never saw either of the main twists at the end coming though one of them I should have. The last one hit me out of left field though once I started reading it I knew what was coming. <br /> <br />Picoult does a good job using alternate viewpoints to portray each member of the family, the lawyer Anna retains and the guardian ad litem appointed to her, as richly drawn characters. I was impressed by Picoult's ability to manage lots of minute details in what was already a fairly complex story. Each of these characters that tell their story gives some insight into what is going on in this family's world or into the motivations of the characters. At times, the alternate viewpoints pick up right where the previous left off, showing us the scene from another's point of view; at other times the action moves some other place, showingus that the world continues on for others even as Kate and Anna's world is spiraling around them. This management of detail adds to the story for me, by giving us glimpses into why the son acts out, into the lawyer's past, into how the decisions were made for Kate and subsequently for Anna. Not all of the story centers around the child who is sick and the child who is well but might as easily be sick given how often she sees the inside of a hospital yet even the parts that don't contain bits of information about them add to the story in complex ways. <br /> <br />And that is perhaps the true gift of this book, that it intertwines the complex with the simple, the past with the present, the moral with the just. Reading I could understand why the decisions that were made were made but I could also see how one child seemed to be invisible to her parents because of the sicker child. <br /> <br />All in all I give this book a good rating but I warn you, it's a tear jerker. I also don't recommend reading it in public, least of all at work where people can see you crying your eyes out.
0765317389|5.0|If you did not read this book by the time you graduated high-school, you owe it to your self to read it.  I have read it many times and the story is never tiresome.  This is a wonderful 'coming of age' story with roots in Lord of the Files.  I loved the idea that childern are the focal characters, but not just any ordanary childern.  Great ending as well.  No matter how many times I read it, I can never seem to put it down.  I only gave it five stars, because there wern't more to give.
B000O75F7C|5.0|There's just not much more I can say about this band that I haven't already said.  Steven Wilson's music can bring you to tears one minute, and banging your head the next minute.  Porcupine Tree has everything I love about music in general, and this album is no exception. <br /> <br />Fear of a Blank Planet speaks to me more than any other PT album has in the past, because its subject matter consists of all the things that terrify me about raising a child in the \\"digital age\\" of over-medication, over-stimulation, and being raised in a latch key environment.   <br /> <br />In the last couple of years with the release of Deadwing, In Absentia, and this disc, I have put Porcupine Tree on a very high pedestal.  My addiction started with Stupid Dream and it has only grown since then.

B000LPS47U|5.0|Excellent gross effects. Over the top story and acting. Anyone who even remotely likes zombie/slasher films has to see this. There is at least one moment that is as cinematically significant as the final scene of Pink Flamingos. The Lovecraft purists will have a problem with the deviations from the original book. But the film is so good and so much fun that you have to give it a shot. And the Anchor Bay release has good features. Thanks to them for giving us back this classic.
1582701709|1.0|Ok, positive thinking is one thing, but this book is completely off the charts.  The author and her \\"experts\\" make some seriously strong statements in this money-making machine.  She said that we cause our illnesses ourselves, by how we think. She specifically said that you can control the physical world with your thoughts. This is exactly what she says, over and over! For instance, she said that she corrected her eyesight with her thoughts. Yep.  That's what she said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This \\"secret\\" claims to be the answer to EVERYTHING. I am irritated that this woman and others are going around telling people that they can have anything, ANYTHING, they want. I am even more irritated that this woman is getting rich off of people's desperations.  <br /> <br />I mean, come on, it says \\"Everything that is coming into your life, you are attracting into your life...It is this law that determines the complete order in the universe, every moment of your life, and every single thing you experience in your life. This all-powerful law is doing that through your thoughts.\\" It says that the law of attraction is \\"the greatest and most infallible law upon which the entire system of creation depends.\\"  <br /> <br />Those are pretty strong statements, and the whole book is like that. And people BELIEVE IT. The genocides in Africa, those people brought that on themselves with their victim mentality (that's what Rhonda said in an interview). Little children who get molested - what about them?  What about people who are born with disabilities?  Did they bring that on themselves?  Did their mother cause their disabilities?  Did Michael J Fox bring his Parkinson's Disease upon himself?  So all those Africans that we enslaved a couple hundred years ago, they brought that on themselves? Talk about blame the victim.   <br /> <br />The book completely overlooks these tragedies and oversimplifies situations. Go ahead and think positively, of course. But this book and the \\"gurus\\" aren't saying that at all.  They LITERALLY say that you can open up a \\"catalog\\" and \\"order\\" what you want from the \\"Universe\\".  They say it's that easy.  So, my son who has cerebral palsy, I can open up the catalog and ask for him to be normal?  He can't open up the catalog himself, you know, because of the whole cerebral palsy and mental retardation thing. <br /> <br />In short, the author of this book and her \\"experts\\" should be ashamed of themselves.  They are getting rich off of lying to people.  If you want to read a good book about how thinking positively can help you change your life for the better, then I suggest Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking.  I'm sure that there are more books that are good that I don't know about - it's just one that I remember reading that made sense to me.  You could probably get it at the library for free - even better!
1400049628|5.0|I loved this book! It was very fun to read-- it was actually a little bit creepy because Max seemed so into it, but hey, i mean if this zombie thing does go down....wouldn't you want to be prepared to the T? I literally had to read it when someone was home!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Although there are numerous books, novels, documentaries and films about the Holocaust, all shocking and deeply sad, one would have to rank Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, Schindler's List, somewhere at the top for its alarming realism, meaningful pathos and informative message, designed to ensure that the brutal crimes of the Holocaust during WW2, will never be forgotten.<br /><br />Shot entirely in black and white, the decision to do so by the director, Spielberg says, he had never seen a photo or primary documentary of the Holocaust in color, thus shooting the project in mono tones seemed the logical action to take. This proved to be problematic for the cinematographer and set designer, because certain colors appear wrong under mono photography, and of course the lighting is set-up much differently to achieve particular effects. As one producer stated in an interview, \\"It was like we were shooting two movies.\\" One would have to admit that the film felt to the viewer to be a primary historical source (a dramatic 1940's documentary) as a result of the black and white tones, but also the performances from the entire cast.<br /><br />Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler is a performance worthy of all the awards he received at the time. His Czechoslovakian accent is subtle and accurate, his every line spoken with deep meaning and his performance during one of the last scenes, leaving the factory with his wife, the Jewish worker's awarding him with a letter of honor and a gold ring, (made from the filling of one of the worker's) is absolutely superb and terribly moving. Oscar Schindler is a true hero during WW2, spending his fortune in order to save as many Jewish prisoner's as humanly possible from the Nazi SS.<br /><br />It should be noted that the violence and abject cruelty of the Holocaust for younger audiences at least, when hearing about the event, can become desensitized, flippantly dismissed as just \\"something\\" that happened in the past. What makes this movie so important is the violence depicted is in no way gratuitous, this sadistic criminal acts actually occurred, driving home the point that we should never forget what happened, and do everything possible to prevent the same crimes repeating. Unfortunately, genocide seems to occur across the planet in various forms to this day, (Rwanda, Bosnia, etc.) all terrible, all crimes against humanity.<br /><br />If you are a parent, teacher or citizen, this is the film to show that depicts the true horrors of the Holocaust, giving it tremendous meaning and has enough impact to ensure it remains in the mind, hoping that in the future this awful event is never repeated.movie so important is the violence depicted is in no way gratuitous, this sadistic criminal acts actually occurred, driving home the point that we should never forget what happened, and do everything possible to prevent the same crimes repeating.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|So much has been written about this film, I have little to add. All I can say is that this film 'broke all the rules' and I was aghast and ashamed that the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences didn't have the balls to give it the best picture award that it so richly deserved. Because of that, I have given up watching the Academy Awards as it is obvious now (well, it was really obvious before, but I was ever-hopeful) that it is a total political game and not at all about which film is the best, which performance is the best, or who deserves to win. I own the film and watch it often. As heartbreaking as it is, and even though it always makes me cry, it has such a deep haunting feeling about it that draws me to it over and over again. Thank you to Ang Lee and all the actors for bringing this film to us - all of us who have watched it and learned from it are the richer for the experience.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel absolutely earned his Oscar with this performance.  I have never hated such a character before in my life.  A good script, yes, perhaps a few too many coincidences; especially about the girl Hawk saves being related to the men Denzel recruits to get rid of Hawk.  The one thing and perhaps the only thing you remember about this is Denzel.  highly, highly recommended.
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|I never really paid that much attention to My Chemical Romance other than their singles simply because I really didn't see anything that distanced them from any other punk-pop band out there. I did get my hands on their latest offering The Black Parade though, and, well, it looks like Gerard Way and company might be trying a little too hard to change their style.<br /><br />First off, the way the album is structured is a little odd. I mean, the very first track is called \\"The End\\"; wouldn't it make more sense for that to be the LAST track? And shouldn't \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" be the opening track on an album called The Black Parade? Speaking of that, \\"black\\" sometimes refers to a dark state of mind, and that's pretty evident on this album, in that many of the songs seem to be about horrible days and/or death, like \\"Dead\\" and \\"Mama\\". And although I liked \\"Cancer\\" when I heard them perform it on Saturday Night Live, when I really listened to the lyrics, I was like, \\"Sheesh.\\"<br /><br />Some of the other songs are a little odd too. \\"Teenagers\\" doesn't go anywhere, and as for the hidden track, \\"Blood\\", well, I just don't get it. And this album is another one of those cases where it seems like the EXPLICIT CONTENT sticker is there because the guys are swearing just for the sake of swearing.<br /><br />There are still some good songs, though. \\"I Don't Love You\\", \\"Disenchanted\\" and \\"This Is How I Disappear\\", are pretty decent, as well as the aforementioned \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\". But this is their darkest offering yet, which means that fans of their first two albums might not even be able to get into it. Maybe they wanted to drift out of the emo scope because all the members are hitting 30, but I still hope they lighten things up for their next record.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

0385336691|3.0|This book, or at least some details in it, was somewhat disappointment for me. Somehow Reacher does very unprofessional things in the beginning of the book (following text may contain some spolers, sorry for that). <br />While watchout for the door, Reacher does not check beforehand whether there is backdoor or not for that building. Somehow that would be very very basic thing to do.  <br />Also, the car with the money is left totally without surveillance. Further, there is no attempt to videotape or photograph the events near the car, how difficult would it be to to place some miniature device recording? Or for Reacher himself (or for some \\"extra\\") to use the camera? Especially when the husband of kidnapped woman has probably tens of millions of dollars one could suspect there are plethora of means that could be used. Anyhow, no aerial (helicopter etc.) nor electronic means are used to follow the money car. Why is that? <br /> <br />So, considering all the facts above, it seems that somehow in the plot persons had to be extremely stupid not to solve problem too early. Very confusing, earlier Reacher has been smart guy, prob he has now lost his edge?? <br /> <br />Otherwise book is nice to read, but this lack of professionalism leaves little bit strange feeling of the book.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|A note of warning - even if you have an HD-TV you'll also need either a Blu-Ray player or the Playstation 3 to play this high-definition disc.  A normal DVD player will not work.  The quality will be much better than a DVD though! <br /> <br />Enjoy this fine series.
0743496728|1.0|I thought this book was TERRIBLE, not only the subject matter but it was BORING nothing original. I really threw it in the trash I was going to give it away but with the way the world is now I thought best to get rid of it for good.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|A note of warning - even if you have an HD-TV, you'll need a special HD-DVD player to play this disc.  If you have a normal DVD player it will not work. <br /> <br />If you have a Playstation 3, you want to buy the Blu-Ray version of this disc, as the PS3 does not play HD-DVD discs, only DVD's and Blu-Ray discs.  Blu-Ray discs hold the same HD video that the HD-DVD version has.
B000096BLG|5.0|Maybe someone in Pennsylvania is selling bootleg copies. I own the original vinyl as well as the CD and the sound quality on both is excellent. The combination of Michael's great songs with the musicianship of Crossfire (a band which wowed everyone at Montreux)is simply outstanding. If you would like a short version of a \\"Best of Michael Franks\\" performed by outstanding musicians, this album is a must have.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I have been a huge Dream Theater fan since the mid-90's, and it was my love for them that led me to discover Porcupine Tree in 2004.   <br />With one listen to \\"In Absentia\\", I couldn't believe what I'd been missing.  Simply put, Porcupine Tree played with all the passion, poignancy, texture, beauty, and heaviness that I love about music.  While Dream Theater will always be my favorite for their sheer virtuosity, Porcupine Tree trumps them when it comes to writing the perfect song.   <br /> <br />\\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" gives us 6 more perfect songs.  The opening title track is a monster, \\"My Ashes\\" is a beautiful follow-up, and \\"Anesthetize\\" is the climactic epic containing everything great about this band.  You know you're terrific songwriters when you can compose an 18-minute song that never grows stale.   <br /> <br />\\"Sentimental\\" is another beautiful and sad piece, and then \\"Way Out of Here\\" and \\"Sleep Together\\" bring things to an eerie and heavy close.  The theme of a blank, indifferent youth culture is well-executed throughout, with many of the lyrics open to interpretation as to what exactly our protagonist is experiencing at the moment.  <br /> <br />While I'm looking forward to a few more releases this year (Rush, Dream Theater), \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" will undoubtedly fall into my Top 5 of 2007.   <br />
B000002LK1|3.0|I was never as impressed with this CD as other music from Depeche Mode. <br />If you are a die hard Depeche fan, you will enjoy!  I still love all the early stuff.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|...is really amazing, so deep and great. The movie would never be so good without this great music.
B00005JPAO|5.0|As one who has seen pictures of Elizabeth in early black and white newsreels in the local movie houses during WWII, I've been aware of her existence it seems like forever.  Sort of like water to a goldfish, she's always been \\"there\\" but I never thought much about her.  Until Diana's death and then my focus was on Diana.  Now this film has switched my focus to the Queen.  Hmmm.   <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Mirren's performance was superb and certainly Oscar worthy.   She's a classy lady and the class shows up here.  The one thing that worries me, though, is that she may have infused the character of Elizabeth with some of her own generous humanity, thus making her more friendly than she really is. I found myself much more sympathetic to her at the end of the film than I was in the beginning.  Even the doltish Prince Phillip seemed sort of harmlessly quaint and even humorous. Were these people really that nice?  Who knows?  <br /> <br />I have found this to be a problem in many films---I loved John Lone as the Last Emperor of China but was the real emperor really that sweet?  Doubt it. Also, Sir Thomas More....After watching Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons, anyone would immediately vote for More's sainthood.  Yet, we read that the real Thomas had a dark side that the film doesn't show.   <br /> <br />Like Marlon Brando's performance of the Godfather did a lot to glamorize  guys who probably were really an ugly bunch of thugs.   <br /> <br />So....I think it's important to see these \\"historical\\" movies, enjoy them, but keep an open mind about the veracity of the characterizations.  Film actors are by nature, attractive people, and it's a mistake to attribute their innate likableness to the people they portray.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Most Paul Simon fans are probably my parent's age, but I luckily happened upon his solo music in my early 20's and just fell in love!  I fall even deeper every time I listen to this particular masterpiece of an album.  Because of its African sound, I highly recommend listening to this on a beautiful sunny day.  And please don't forget to listen to the lyrics (this goes for all his albums).  Listening to \\"Homeless\\" yesterday in the long-awaited New York sunshine moved me to tears.  \\"Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes\\" is always a magical experience too.  I don't know where it'll take you, but it takes me to a very happy place:)   <br /> <br />Paul Simon's music is like nothing else out there. And this album is the epitome of his genius.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Truly a beautiful picture; scriptwise as well as scenery. If Anne Francis was any more gorgeous, we would all go blind. STILL cannot understand why she did not have THEE career over this 50 year span. Total waste of talent. Her agent should hide in shame. If you also see her work in Twilight Zone (the brunette in the one staged in the country and I believe she was a witch, and the second episode when she was a mannequin in the department store...BOTH MASTERPIECES. God Bless you Miss Francis: a 45 year old\\"new fan\\"....
0143038419|4.0|Yes, the style is easy and light, but I found it funny and interesting. The writing is actually quite good.  For me, it turned into a real page-turner. Perhaps she is a bit self-absorbed, but this is after all the story of a personal quest, and, anyway, aren't we all (to varying degrees).    I came away with a deep and important message deceptively hidden by this breezy tone. Whether or not it was intended by the author I cannot know. I see this as a sort of coming of age story, of a person tormented by life's pressures and expectations that come to roost in a nonfunctional marriage. This story carries a message that life is about crises, our reactions to them, and their eventual healing, usually long in coming. The resolution to each of these leaves us, while neither saints nor pillars of knowledge, with just a little more maturity, wisdom, and peace of mind. Life is a cycle of cycles, and I enjoyed Liz's cycle.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|<br />To be perfectly honest, after the first hour I thought I had the whole movie figured out... and then it twisted in the opposite direction and I was totally shocked!  <br />Katie Holmes plays Samantha MacKenzie, the President's Daughter who is trying to fit in and have a normal college experience. Only there are some things in her way, such as security guards following her everywhere, press close on her tail, and she just can't get rid of her White House mannerisms that kinda make everyone around her flinch and go \\"what was that?\\" Amerie plays her roommate Mia who is used to lots of attention and has trouble letting it go. Seemingly perfect timing, Sam meets her perfect guy (Marc Blucas playing James)... a little too perfect at first, as they are both brainiacs, kind, funny and well, he's crazy about her. It seems everything is going to work out perfectly! I was almost disappointed when the movie twisted in a completely different direction! <br /> <br />While I was at first shocked, I quickly got over it and was pleasantly surprised and proud that the script succeeded in being unpredictable (because most movies are predictable). Then I became disappointed. It seemed the film was going steady in a good direction, and I felt kind of let down, like they could have done more, like the story could have developed into something truly charming and touching, however it seems they decided to veer away from the romance of the film and focus more on the main character's adolescance and learning about herself. It seemed to me like the movie was strolling along and then suddenly dropped off a cliff, however safely landing. <br />It was not unpleasant. Despite the twist, they managed to give it a cute (although almost cliff hanger) ending, and a beautiful final scene. I must admit I was slightly disappointed with the outcome between Sam and James, but I guess I can't always be satisfied! <br /> <br />A very entertaining film however some letdowns and [I feel] almost unnecessary twists. Nevertheless, I have no doubt you will enjoy it as I did. The script is witty and aimed more at preteens and teens then adults, as it is completely clean, and some of the jokes just won't reach adults as they are just not very funny, however I think I might have laughed at them when I was younger so it's not totally hopeless. <br /> <br />The acting makes up for most of these faults however, as Katie Holmes was charming and fun to watch, as was Marc Blucas who isn't exactly ugly either!
0307165485|5.0|I had three copies of this book as a little girl, and my own child has loved through two copies in three years.  It is my standard baby gift and opens up a child's world to nature, art, color, animals, and other cultures (so that's why I love all things france!  It's all pierre the paris detective's fault!).  A wonderful childhood classic.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I had no problems whatsoever playing this on a Toshiba XA2. <br /> <br />The movie itself is pretty good.  Flows really well, except that I had to stop and turn captions on a few times as I just couldn't make out the dialogue.  Brits would have no problem, though :) Some great moments and intriguing directorial techniques.
1591840562|2.0|The book's title is apparently a homage to Donald Trump's \\"The Art of the Deal\\", and there are alot of similarities.  Both Trump and Kawasaki have attempted with some success to create personality cults based on exaggerated accounts of their real world business success, and then to make money selling their banal wisdom to legions of wannabes.  Both have profited from sleazy seminar businesses.  In reality, Kawasaki has only had very limited success as a startup founder, and even less as a venture capitalist.  Do a Google search under \\"Dude Yamaha\\" for an excellent first hand account of Kawasaki in  action.  Thanks, but if I want advice on starting a startup, I'll get it from someone who actually has a track record.
B000NVTHR8|5.0|I checked it out on their Myspace page and it sounds very good!!

B0000214F0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever made.  It's a shame, because the story of Caligula is actually really interesting, and for the first 20 minutes, this film is actually decent.  This is the part where we see the real actors, like John Gielguld and Peter O'Toole.  They end up getting killed off rather early, and the rest of the film is just one lewd act after lewd act.  Lots of gore, hardcore sex, more gore, etc., etc..  Aside from the aformentioned opening 20 minutes, the rest of the film is badly acted (except for McDowell, who is good at Caligula), badly shot (the camera movements are jerky, and it is poorly lit and framed), and the dialogue is very poor.  This was based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, but it's rather obvious that Bob Guccione spruced up the hardcore sex angle, and made himself a spokesperson for the first amendment with this film.  While the film should be available and should never be censored (bad taste and crappy filmmaking is not a reason to disregard the first amendment), it doesn't make it art just because the film \\"polarises\\" people and that it's controversial.  It's a real ordeal to sit through, and it's not erotic at all (porn rarely is).  It's a rather depressing experience, mainly because it's just really bad filmmaking.  I wonder what kind of film would have turned out if they had followed Gore Vidal's screenplay more closely.  If you want to check out something really good about Caligula, rent the British miniseries I, Claudius, which really goes into Caligula's madness and his rule.
B000MXPE74|5.0|Picked this up mostly because I wanted to get free shipping from Amazon and this was cheap and recommended for me. Had never heard of the band. Put on the CD and promptly realized why it had been picked out for me. AMAZING. Nearly every song is terrific, my personal favorites at the moment being \\"Henrietta\\" and \\"For The Girl.\\" Every song has so much energy it's hard to sit still while listening, and the hooks are the catchiest I've heard in a long time. Amazing debut, god knows why it took so long to release it in the US!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I saw this in the theater, and I thought it was brilliant.  I got it right away.  I didn't like the last third of the film (the \\"twist\\" didn't really work for me), but the first 2/3rds of the film is amongst the best filmmaking I saw during the 90's (not a great decade for films).  Most critics were shocked by this film, saying it was inciting violence.  Roger Ebert, who has given thumbs up to such crap as Speed 2, Die Hard 3, and Con Air, and almost gave thumbs up to Gigli, disliked this film intensely, calling this a \\"fascist\\" film, which it totally isn't.  This is a film about the hollow lives of men during the \\"booming\\" 1990's, except this film really looks at them with a sharp wit and real, hilarious satire.  This is great satire, dripping with sarcasm and real irony, not the Gen X \\"irony\\" that permeated the decade.  The film also came out in 1999, the best year for films in that decade.  Pitt and Norton are superb in their roles, and Fincher's direction is very self assured.  Fincher is one of the more interesting and talented directors working today.  While he's not perfect (Panic Room and The Game were disappointing), Seven and Fight Club are masterpieces.  Harry Knowles was one of the few film critics to really get this film, saying \\"it forces you to have dangerous thoughts, confront them as you would any problem before you and expects you as a reasonable human being to come out with the right answers\\".  The film is not a simplistic, nihilisitic, punk type of film that says \\"go out and destroy stuff\\".  There is real brains behind this film (and its source material, the brilliant novel by Chuck Palahniuk), and there is depth here that was missing in the 1990's.  In many ways, the film exposes the slacker, BS Gen X aesthetic and shows how hollow that lifestyle is.  While it isn't perfect, the film's negatives are small compared to the huge positives it has.  Fight Club is a film awaiting true rediscovery...
1582701709|1.0|Ahhhhh, to get flithy rich on the hopes and shattered dreams of the folks that forked over hard-earned money for this sloppy nonsense of a book.

0618680004|5.0|There seems to be no middle ground with readers of The God Delusion, they either love it or hate it.  That seems to reflect the preconceptions one brings to the volume, the religious feel attacked and the atheists feel vindicated.  The religious scramble to find some way to counter the arguments, the often hostile beratement Dawkins delivers, while the atheists dance on the grave of dying religiosity.<br /><br />My one real beef with the book is that although packed with enough argumentative logic to make it a seminal discourse on the refutation of deity (the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim deity almost exclusively), Dawkins relishes the ad hominem and childish attacks too much.  That undermines his own work in places, and while the humor is biting and I found myself openly laughing I also see how offensive it could be to people of faith.<br /><br />While I'm not going to contribute an overview because that's been covered so many times, in so many ways - in fact the words dedicated to synopsis by the various reviewers most likely exceed the actual words in the substantial volume itself - I will give an impression, my impression.  My impression is that this is a book that I will refer to many times in the future.  This is a book that I will keep on my shelf with the other reference tomes, and one which will become more valuable than the Bible itself.<br /><br />Religion and the belief in God isn't going away, despite the arguments against deity.  But I do think we need to arm ourselves against unwanted religious intrusion into our public and national lives.  Dawkins, for all his gloating, does give a substantial refutation of the idea that morality is religious in nature.  That alone is worth the cover price.  It's brilliant to be able to cite logical case by case for the ideas of humanism as a source of moral behavior and good conduct.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great read, a valuable resource.  I'll recommend it to all my friends, and send it as presents at Christmas (nothing could be more appropriate).<br /><br /> - CV Ricks presents at Christmas (nothing could be more appropriate). <br /> <br /> - CV Rick
0060555661|5.0|I'm sure my grandfather read the original edition of this book, because he gave me the same advice as Benjamin Graham. Most of this seems obvious once you have read it, but in a world that lives off of hype and insanity, any serious investor would benefit greatly from the advice in this book. <br /> <br />If you only buy one book on investing, make it this one.
B00005QB42|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful voice - highly recommended and not only for the Guyatri Mantra.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|... at how Scorcese essentially makes a \\"Boston Irish\\" version of Goodfellas. If you or your parents are from Beantown (or all your cousins, in our case) you will be amazed at how the actors capture the accents and feel of Boston.<br /><br />And if you like films about the Mob with dense plotting and double (maybe triple?) crosses, \\"The Departed\\" will definitely provide nearly three hours of lively entertainment. Sure there are a fair number of improbable plot twists but that is to be expected with a Hong Kong action flick remake.<br /><br />Watch this one on a Saturday night when you have time to enjoy it and hold on for the ride.

1400063515|5.0|It's a rare book that makes you look at the world differently. The Black Swan enhances our awareness of our skewed way of viewing reality and the damage that can cause. Taleb focuses on one kind of bias: our penchant to forget the improbable. Rare events with big impact, here represented by the black swan, are easy to ignore until they happen. Because they don't show up for long periods, the risk is invisible--out of sight, out of mind.     As he demonstrated with his earlier Fooled by Randomness, Taleb has an exceptional ability to ground abstract ideas in concrete examples, some from his own experience as quant, derivatives trader and hedge fund manager, but also from other aspects of life. The civil war that descended upon his family in Lebanon, a place where ethnic groups lived together in amity for a century, makes a vivid illustration. His well-to-do and politically connected relatives were sure that that the conflict would end in a matter of days; instead it lasted 17 years.      While the book is mostly a demonstration of our cognitive failings, it also contains a quirky but useful how-to manual for dealing with an unpredictable world where huge consequences can follow from tiny differences. Chapter 13, with a title that starts \\"Appelles the Painter\\", explains what to do when you don't know what will come.    Entertaining as they are, chapter headings like \\"How to Look for Bird Poop\\" don't help the reader navigate what is an unconventional, nonlinear format. While it bristles with intriguing ideas, the book as a whole is not easy to grasp, as those familiar with Mr. Taleb's style from Fooled by Randomness will know. Each piece is powerfully engaging, but the entire argument is more elusive. But being forced to figure it out is no bad thing and along the way one laughs at the absurdities of fate and humanity.
B000002LJA|5.0|I remember seeing all the videos and hearing all the songs on cassette of Quincy Jones' Back on the Block album. I bought the cassette when it came out and eventually purchased the CD, which I still proudly own. Quincy Jones' return marked the return of Barry White (my idol, my mentor, God rest his soul; for I, too, wailed at his passing) in the well-loved \\"Secret Garden\\" hit along with Al B. Sure, James Ingram, and El DeBarge. It also marked the debut of Tevin Campbell in \\"Tomorrow\\". With Quincy Jones' spin on \\"Birdland\\", \\"The Brazilian Wedding Song\\", \\"I'll Be Good To You\\" and others, the word \\"classic\\" is an understatement to appropriately describe this CD; it's definitely a must-have.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is by far the greatest documenrty ever created,it just completely took me by surprise,I definitly like David Attenborough's narration better than Sigourney Weaver's,sorry Sigourney I love ya but Attenborough's voice just fits much better.The greatest thing I've ever seen in nature and probly ever will see!This is a once in a lifetime series,it could change the way you see your own planet.A must,must have!!

B000002AGM|5.0|Take a step back in time, fifty years to be exact and hear what was going on in the evolution  of Miles Davis 's musical life. I'm not a fan of big band jazz but I love Miles and this is the exception to the rule. That coupled with the arrangements of Gil Evans makes for one of the most interesting albums Miles recorded. I can't overemphasize the beautiful job done by Gil Evans in the arrangements. The orchestra is sublime; it is flawless. One of the more interesting aspects of this disc is the hint of things to come in the collaboration between Miles and Evans. \\"The Maids of Cadiz\\" is a warm bluesy number that is a precursor to the classic album \\"Sketches of Spain,\\" as is the Spanish inspired \\"New Rhumba\\" and \\"Blues for Pablo.\\" It is worth noting that \\"Blues For Pablo\\" was recorded in chunks during rehersal and pieced togehther from seven different segments but no  one would be the wiser without the fine liner notes. This is a masterpiece recording that sounds spectacular on a good stereo system or with high quality headphones. The music is mellow, laid back and unlike some of the more adventurous recordings of Miles Davis. The fact that he is playing flugelhorn helps in Miles dispensing a kinder mellower sound, softer than his bop days and more refined than his fusion period. The music on \\"Miles Ahead\\" is different and best appreciated as one continium as a suite. Sit back , close your eyes and let the music take you away, back fifty years when life was simpler and Miles was cool. Recommended for jazz fans . This is the third version recorded of this LP, the alternate takes and remastering make it the best available. This is a classic.
0345494768|5.0|I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was a kid, and have collected a tremendous amount of \\"making of\\" material in various forms over the years, so I figured I'd heard it all and seen it all. I've read this volume cover to cover now, and what I have seen and read opens a whole new chapter in my understanding of this milestone film. There are literally hundreds of photos in this book I have never seen, and the process of making the film (all the way from original concept to opening day) is documented with a level of detail far beyond any account that exists. This is not light reading or a \\"bubble-gum\\" movie souvenir book, but an extremely detailed account of the struggles, disasters, and eventual successes of a film that changed cinema forever. The research and production of this tome was obviously a massive project, but the results are truly impressive. Rinzler's book will surely be the definitive work on this important subject.
B00001P4RI|4.0|This album makes my limbs go limp which Dead Can Dance won't do. It's got a slower, lonelier sound than Dead Can Dance. It's earthy and dream-like as on an overcast day with patches of sun and a bit of starry nighttime latter on. As a solo record (and I am holding out that Dead Can Dance isn't really broken up)it shows Perry as the more down-to-earth member. Gerrard's made-up-language lyrics that often ascend to the heavens while very very cool, sometimes I wish she would use real non-western languages here and there..perhaps she does.<br /><br />Nevertheless, here we have a great understated yet slick production with some great FX experimentation. It is a bit psychedelic, as a \\"mushroom trip through the moors\\" as another reviewer here says although with topics such as child abuse on \\"Archangel\\" and aging such as on \\"Saturday's Child\\" I wouldn't call it \\"trite\\" unless this reviewer himself has accomplished some great work of art that we need to know about.<br /><br />Otherwise, more down headed and resigned sounding than Dead Can Dance. I found \\"The Captive Heart\\" to be a very romantic number that made me think of my lady although I'm not sure if this CD stands up to as many repeat listens as DCD does. I hope it does. I am very curious to hear what Mr. Perry does next as waiting for Gerrard to come back to studio recording with Dead Can Dance may take too long. He is a great talent and very unusual in this day and age where the vocalist actually sings and has lyrics that are even worth reading on the liner notes.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I love her voice and her music.  This is a sensational blast from the past.  Her voice is uniquely her own in sound.
B00004W3L3|5.0|MISPLACED CHILDHOOD is Marillion's best album ever. Essentially, the lyrics chronicle the childhood and adolescent experiences of lead singer Fish, as well as the consequences they had for his later life, but in reality, it could be about anyone. The lyrics on this album are, for me, a reminder of how my years at a special school left both positive and negative impacts on me, and how it was only after developing a major crush on a pretty actress that I was finally able to put paid to any intention of going back for food-related reunions. This is an album that you need to listen to over and over in order to grasp all of its meanings.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If you are  Neil Young fan you will LOVE this release.  You can literally feel the energy of his prime in these recordings.  Awesome!

B000O178BY|2.0|Come on people...<br /><br />If you think thsat this album or With Teeth, are musical masterpieces in the industrial genre, then you have a lot to think about...<br /><br />With Teeth? Dave Grohl? no... just no... bad... all bad...<br /><br />Year Zero? even though it is more familiar like The Fragile it is more of a mixture between The Fragile and With Teeth.  There is something missing lately in the NIN formula.  Let's not forget this guy bounced off the recognition of Skinny Puppy and other industrial underground acts (who are all still going strong by the way.) and also, he is partly responsible for the man who can't decide what music he wants to do Marilyn Manson...<br /><br />Truth is, Mr. reznor got screwed out of Nothing Records and he wants a little more money so he will pound out mediocre albums to the people who are still clinging to the days of The Fragile and Downward Spiral.<br /><br />As for a review?<br /><br />Take the lighter nails moments of The Fragile mixed with the darker parts of Tori Amos, along with some bad, and you will get Year Zero.  Say goodbye to Mr. Reznor, and Mr. Manson, and probably the likes of KMFDM as well, because as far as industrial music goes, these guys waved goodbye a long time ago.
B000O75F7C|3.0|Maybe I need to hear the record a few more times.... but after my first couple of listens, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is not really doing it for me.    One exception:  \\"Let's Sleep Together\\" is far and away my favorite song on the album, and is the only one I'll add as a favorite in iTunes.  I love the arrangement of the strings and the way they build to a climactic finish.    It's not a bad record by any means, but it's no \\"in Absentia\\" either.    (REVIEW UPDATE:  Four Days Later)    The album has indeed grown on me.  I have the DTS surround special edition and cranked the thing up on my home theater.  I studied the lyrics as well... very bleak indeed.    I would now rate as four stars.  I really like \\"My Ashes\\" and \\"FOABP\\" as well... \\"Anesthetize\\" is good, but not outstanding... it's just too darn long, but I do enjoy its complexity.    (REVIEW UPDATE:  October, 2007)    I'm an idiot, this is a five-star record.  \\"Anesthetize\\" is now in my Top-5 PT songs.  I've had the pleasure of hearing the band perform live twice since this album was released, and \\"Sleep Together\\" is one of their two best live songs (after \\"Halo\\").
B00005JO20|1.0|This movie is completely empty and boring, but because Naomi Watts is in it so I bought the DVD.  She's so gorgeous.  Too bad the 3 hours is a complete waste of time.  Teh special effects -- which make up 95% of the movie -- are laughable.  You can almost see the wires and rendering frames.  Complete trash -- save for Naomi.
B000N6TX22|1.0|This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months). <br />There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one.

0684843749|5.0|This is the best book you'll ever buy on bodybuilding, not to be confused with power lifting, and casual weight training. You will learn all the basics no matter what you're desire but this is geared toward hardcore, dedicated bodybuilding, like Arnold. He is the King of bodybuilding and he'll let you in on, diet requirments, motivation, positive attitude, and all the workouts you'll need. But, be warned he expects 6 day a week training cycles. If you want less you'll have to tweak his programs yourself.
B000O75F7C|4.0|I'm a relatively new Tree fan. The first time I discovered them was about three months after Deadwing was released. But in that time, they've become my favorite band. The way they weave lush textures and dreamlike soundscapes around incredibly catchy melodies is an experience that one would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. And that's what Tree music is: an experience. Perhaps their earlier album-oriented records more than their recent song-driven albums, but FOABP is clearly a trip back to their roots. Think as if they had taken the metal out of the last two albums and stuck it into Signify, and you've got a vague idea as to what FOABP has. But like any other PT album, this one's tough to classify. <br /> <br />This album, however, is not resonating with me like previous albums. It's definitely a very good album, and it's definitely more consistent and better than Deadwing, though it just seems to lack the highlights that DW had (\\"Anesthetize\\" is no \\"Arriving Somewhere\\", but then again, nothing is). DW is one of my least-favorite Tree albums, but it did have its moments. FOABP is consistently good throughout, but it never really touches greatness like their masterpieces have. <br /> <br />At times, it just feels like PT is trying too hard to outdo itself. I love the 12-minute epic, \\"Arriving Somewhere\\", but \\"Anesthetize\\", while a very strong track, feels a little too proggy and just goes on for too long. The first two parts are awesome, but the third section (the song can easily be broken up into three parts) just feels tacked on to extend it, and it's honestly a little boring. I hope PT doesn't go into Dream Theater territory of trying to put a 20-minute song on every album just because so many people think that any song over 10 minutes is a good song by default. <br /> <br />The musicianship is great, even though virtuosity is the last thing I look for in a PT album. Gavin Harrison is quickly showing that he's one of the greatest and easily the most underrated drummer in the business. Richard Barbieri comes to the forefront on this keyboard-driven album, adding the texture and atmosphere that anyone would expect from a PT album. Listening to this album without headphones would be doing a great disservice to it. <br /> <br />But this album IS consistently very good. The title track sounds a bit like Deadwing's title track, but better. It's heavier; the guitar and drums in the intro catch you immediately; the textures during the chorus cascade in a wall of sound that is precedent for the rest of the album. \\"My Ashes\\" is a little straightforward and feels like a slightly more lush Blackfield song, but it's an emotional highlight. \\"Sentimental\\" follows in this vein with a catchy chorus and more keyboard textures. \\"Way Out of Here\\" may be the weakest song on the album, but it's still a good song with ethereal textures, although it goes on for a little too long. <br /> <br />\\"Sleep Together\\" is the highlight of the album. When the keyboards warble in, the listener immediately feels as if he has been thrown into a nightmare. Given the song's meaning about suicide and escape from this world that the album has been presenting, it's easily the most sinister song PT has ever released, and in stark contrast to the lulling and gentle album closers PT has been known for. The strings are brought to the forefront and provide what is likely the strongest texture of the album. <br /> <br />Still, the album is nowhere near perfect. The lyrics need work. The concept of a youth corrupted by Xbox, prescription drugs, MTV, pornography, and the Internet is presented in the title track, but nothing new is really presented until \\"Sleep Together\\", when the idea of suicide is brought out. The prescription drugs idea is overused in every song. PT was never really known for their lyrics, but for an album that's only 50 minutes long, you would imagine they'd know how to mix it up a little better. And that's another weakness: the album is a little too short, especially when you consider there are only six songs. Yes, the songs are generally pretty long, but by the time \\"Sleep Together\\" comes to its powerful conclusion, you're left wanting more. <br /> <br />The greatest issue I have is that FOABP just doesn't deliver on every front. None of the songs have any subtlety to them. The wall of sound is good to an extent, but at times, less might just be more. The album just feels too heavy all around, even on the lighter songs. The strength of In Absentia, their second-strongest album in my opinion, was that it seemed to incorporate everything they've ever done. It may have been less consistent, but it touched on every base and took you on an emotional rollercoaster. Stupid Dream, my favorite PT album, had the greatest power to manipulate the mind and created the perfect bridge between their purely psychedelic albums and their rock-oriented albums. FOABP, on the other hand, just seems to hit you like a wrecking ball over and over again. The death metal section at the end of the second section of \\"Anesthetize\\" personifies this perfectly. That's okay when that's what you're looking for, but that's not what I've come to expect from the Tree. I didn't come to listen to Opeth. <br /> <br />Don't let this keep you from buying the album, though. It's a great album and still miles ahead of 95% of the crap that's out there. But in the high standards that I hold for my favorite band, I just feel a little let down. Just a little. <br /> <br />Fear of a Blank Planet - 9/10 <br />My Ashes - 8.5/10 <br />Anesthetize - 9.5/10 <br />Sentimental - 8/10 <br />Way out of Here - 7.5/10 <br />Sleep Together - 10/10
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a damn shame this show didn't go past 1 season.  I felt the same what about the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" from the late '70's. <br /> <br />BTW, that's probably where I was ... shying away from a t.v. series I'd totally geek out on.  ;-) <br /> <br />As for the people who cancelled it ... well, that's Fox for you.  If the show doesn't glorify the shallow and stupid Fox won't run it. <br /> <br />(Yeah, I still like \\"The Simpsons\\".)
B000O75F7C|5.0|THE BAND: Steven Wilson (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Richard Barbieri (keyboards, synthesizers), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 6 tracks clocking in at approximately 50 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, odd/sad/haunting photos of somebody's kids, and thank you's. Guest artists included Alex Lifeson (Rush) - guitar solo on \\"Anesthetize\\", and Robert Fripp (King Crimson) on \\"Way Out Of Here\\". Strings performed by the London Session Orchestra. There is a limited edition 2-disc set available as well - the 2nd disc contains the same music recorded in 5.1 DTS sound (playable only in a DVD player) as well as a 40-page booklet. Label - Atlantic Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Continued brilliance from The Tree. While \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" didn't hit me on first spin like \\"In Absentia\\" (2002) did, it's still ultra fine music from PT mastermind Steven Wilson. Nothing new as far as lyrics go - still dealing with loneliness, rejection, a dark childhood, and a bleak future outlook. I feel \\"Fear\\" takes a step closer to the band's past - reverting back to \\"Signify\\" (1996) and perhaps \\"Stupid Dream\\" (1999) - giving you much more mood and atmosphere, and less rock & pop. Where \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" (2005) had more tracks geared toward the 4 minute \\"rock\\" song, \\"Fear\\" gives you 6 lengthy tracks (4 of the 6 songs are 7 minutes or longer... with \\"Anesthetize\\" just under 18 minutes all by itself). \\"Fear\\" starts off with the title track... I feel this song is oddly similar to \\"Deadwing's\\" title track. Though my least favorite track on the album, it's still a good rock song with a husky jam in the middle (though nothing groundbreaking). Track 2 is where the album takes flight for me. \\"My Ashes\\" starts slow with keyboards/piano and acoustic guitar... with orchestra and the rest of the band joining in later. Simply a beautiful composition. On first listen, \\"My Ashes\\" hit me hard... in the same vein as \\"Even Less\\" - one of my all-time favorite PT songs. \\"Anesthetize\\" is the marathon song - lengthy in all respects. As much as Lifeson's guitar solo stands out (his best work in 2007 is here, not on Rush's \\"Snakes & Arrows\\"), it's Harrison's drumming that intrigues me. In fact, Harrison's drumming throughout the album simply sparkles. \\"Anesthetize\\" features ups and downs and a wide range of emotions with some great guitar work from Wilson.. and this song is on par with PT's other lengthy hard driving jam tune, \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" from \\"Deadwing\\". Through tracks 2 and 3, there are several moments where the keyboards/synth reminds me of Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones' work on \\"No Quarter\\"... dark, eerie, perfect. \\"Sentimental\\" starts and closes as a pretty piano ballad with the band joining nicely in the middle... another wonderful song. \\"Way Out Of Here\\" is the moodiest track - thanks to Robert Fripp... a soft beginning and an extremely heavy ending. The closer \\"Sleep Together\\" starts out with a very industrial feel to it. But then it kicks in and synth/orchrestra takes over... giving it a holier than tho tone. \\"Fear Of A Dark Planet\\" has a slightly different flavor to it then their last 2 albums... maybe the new record label (Atlantic) had something to do with that (probably not - though Lava Records, Snapper and Madfish labels may be a thing of the past for PT); or maybe it's been Wilson's recent collaberative work with Aviv Geffen and their \\"Blackfield\\" albums which seem to be a bit mellower and more keyboard driven. Give this album time - it will get better with repeated spins. Either way, Porcupine Tree has the brains, the production tools, and the chops to release some great albums for years to come. Another excellent release (5 stars).me hard... in the same vein as \\"Even Less\\" - one of my all-time favorite PT songs. \\"Anesthetize\\" is the marathon song - lengthy in all respects.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This could become a Grammy-winner like Avril LaVigne's 2002 debut LET GO. This could become the \\"BEST DAMN THING\\" of her career. This album was preceded by UNDER MY SKIN,released in 2004. LaVigne once again,rocks with her loud soprano and her electric guitar(s). She still makes the guys go wild and continues to appear in publications like Bop,16 and Teen Beat at age 21. Fans will double their pleasure with the CD and DVD,the latter featuring videos of songs from this album and the predecessors.
037582913X|5.0|I can talk about this book from a child's perspective as well as an adult. I so clearly remember reading, reading, and re-reading this book as a kid in the 80s, finding myself fascinated over and over again with the interactive nature of the plot. What an intriguing concept for a child - to feel that they are controlling the progression of the story, and to share in Grover's anxiety and excitement about what - WHAT - lies at the end of the pages. How funny to watch Grover try to literally tie the pages up with rope, to lock them down, to even build a brick wall, all to keep you from getting closer to the \\"monster\\" at the end. I read a lot as a child, and this was one of my first favorites.  <br /> <br />Now, as an expecting mom, I started creating a wish list of books that I want to make sure to share with my own children. This was one of the first to come to mind. I can't wait to share the thrills of this story with them. And now as an adult, I appreciate the little lessons I learned by reading this book as a child - that things aren't always what they seem, and that your fears are much scarier in your imagination than in reality. What a delightful story.
B000DWMN2S|2.0|judge from the title of this movie, you could already predict that this movie would be a pretentious one. from my point of view, what we got here is another never-engind jews holocaust nightmare revisited and replayed, but this time, they might have realized that changed the happenstance venue from germany or poland was necessary, since they've been told again and again thousands times, so the remote controlled jewish production force behind the hollywood movie industry decided to move it to ukrain, another nazi atrocity done to the old mother russia. it's fine with me, but this movie was scripted with a very weird enough and overly pretentious screenplay.<br />why you have to make the nerd wear a magnifying glasses? in order to make him give you a feel that things would become larger, more illuminated, more transparent or, what? this screenplay was so unnaturally put together. but the guy(s) who wrote the screenplay might also know that if without putting some clown+jerk-like characters in it to ridicule itself as a semi comedy, or what should i say...a crossover between drama/tragedy/autobiography/documentary/comedy, this boring movie won't have any box office potential. so weird ukrainian characters were casted into this bored-to-death deadbeat to keep it going.<br />another amazing object in this movie was that old russian car. it could keep driving and driving without refilling the gas tank. and when it ran out of gas, the old guy could suddenly come up with just a small full can of gas and then that small car never needed to stop at gas station anymore (i didn't see any gas station in the ukrainian countryside).<br />well, other than that amazing small car, i didn't get any impression of this boring movie.
B00005JPP6|5.0|The creators of Hot Fuzz managed to pull off a brilliant parody of the action cop/buddy movie coupled with the murder in the perfect English village genre, while at the same time creating one of the best action cop/buddy movies set in a perfect English village. This takes understanding of the genres, respect for the themes, and actors that can pull off the roles without smirking at the camera. <br /> <br />This movie requires that you pay attention as clues are dropped right and left (just like in the English Village Murder genre). There is also the perfect build up for the mismatched police partners (think Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys II, Point Blank etc) so that even though you know how the pair will end up behaving you enjoy watching it happen.  <br /> <br />When the movie takes its last turn into a full blown action flick, you will be ready for the laughter.  <br /> <br />There is some blood and gore as mentioned by another reviewer, but far less  than in the current slasher films. There is plenty of warning so you have time to choose not to watch those scenes. And even the deaths are a parody of slasher films. <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Excellent movie, but not your typical Bond. It has more the intensity and violence of Mission Impossible 3 than  Dr. No, and the babe coming out of the surf is not Ursula Andress, but Daniel Craig. It gives up some of the charm of the earlier Bond films for a bit more gritty reality. The bad guy is really a bad guy, not just someone with quirky habits and a deadly laser beam, the good guy is not invincible, and things don't always turn out as you would like. Not your typical Bond, but definately 5 stars.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I rarely write negative reviews on here but this film was like a train wreck. 'Babel' is yet another incarnation of the whole tried and true \\"east meets west,\\" \\"we're all really the same,\\" international thriller imbued with social commentary genre. Now I don't really have a problem with this per se, but it seems like these days people are so desperate for this type of film that they accept almost anything that is put out there. From the previews, 'Babel' reminded me a lot of 'Syriana\\" which I thouroughly enjoyed. But ultimately, although I think 'Babel' had a lot of potential, it's convoluted story line and weak dialogue ruined it for me.<br /><br />There were several scenes that I found to be absolutely pointless and the film could have easily cut thirty minutes out of it's lengthy 140 minutes without a negative effect. It probably would have actually improved the flow of the film. I did find the stories of the deaf Japanese girl and the two little Morroccan kids to be very touching but even in some parts of that I found myself asking out loud, \\"what the hell is going on?\\" There were way too many instances of the viewer left waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never drops. And the part with the Mexican nanny who brings the kids to Mexico just plain irritated me. Now I'm sure some people will say that this is just nuance and I just didn't \\"get it.\\" Yes, I get the part that the stories were all connected, yada, yada, yada, but I just felt like I was left hanging on too many aspects. For instance, why did the Japanese girl tell the cop that her mother jumped from the balcony? What did her note to the cop say? What happened to the two kids? Just little things like this where the viewer is left in the dark irritated me.<br /><br />That being said, the film was not a total loss. Besides for a few momentary \\"flashes of brilliance,\\" the acting was good and the cinematography was also exceptional. But ultimately the story was just way too disjointed and unfulfilling and at the end I was left feeling empty and frustrated.ng and at the end I was left feeling empty and frustrated.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|From the day I first saw the trailer for this movie I knew it was not going to be like any other Bond movie. Just the trailer grabbed me with the hints at a masterful plot, a darker, fresher and more creative Bond who didn't rely on all his fancy (and coincidental) gadgets. I watched this movie coming over on a flight back from England, and I was blown away. Daniel Craig portrays a very somber, dedicated \\"00\\", whose trademark is not his witty comebacks or his cool gadgets, or even his gun, but his ingenuity, his skill and his sheer fury, which he only lets loose when the situation calls for it. Its like watching a tornado from afar. You are amazed, but terribly afraid to come any closer.<br /><br />The ending (which I will not reveal) was a little...out of place for me, specifically one line, right after he says \\"The Job's done.\\" There, that didn't reveal anything for those who haven't seen it, but people who have know what I'm talking about. I found it a little...out of place and disconcerting. I understand why it's there, but I wish it had been done a bit differently.<br /><br />Other than that, I found this movie pretty much flawless. It really brings Bond back to his roots in Ian Flemming's world. The terrific action is coupled with a magnificent plot that keeps twisting and turning, and is very realistic, and quite unlike any other Bond plot. I enjoy the classic Sean Connery films, but when you watch this, you realize that its an entirely new ball park. In many ways, the old style of Bond films is completely different from Casino Royale, because it breaks so many of the traditions of a Bond film.<br /><br />And that is partially why its such a good film, because you've come to expect something out of a Bond film, and this is something so new and totally different, it just blows you away.<br /><br />Five Stars!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I've been a huge enya fan since my college days. I listened to Shepherd Moons and I would play my harp to \\"Caribbean Blue\\" in my farternity house basement. Enya always seemed bubbly and happy and optimistic. Well, those days are over. This is a very angry Enya album. It's almost like the Sith Lord brought her over to the dark side and let her anger flow. There are several tracks on this where she just seems fed up with the establishment and she holds nothing back in unleashing her fury. This is not an album for someone that is soft. Enya takes the ball into the paint, lays down a drop step and slams this ball home on Shaq's head. She doesn't apologize for it either. This is much like a Nine Inch Nails CD, only darker. There are themes on this that made me a little uncomfortable to make pop tarts for a snack. I felt like this album reached out of the stereo and yelled at me for an hour. I'm not going to lie, I enjoy the Cd because everything isn't bright and sunny all of the time. If it was, we'd all just drive Honda's and drink tea all summer. <br /> <br />This type of transformation is not unheard of in the realm of new age music. Burns is quite simply the world's greatest keyboard player. When he took a hiatus from Asschowder a few months ago, he unleashed some hard core keyboard music dealing with sandwiches and Nascar that quite frakly, the world wasn't ready to hear. He just got out the keyboard and explored the space. He sent the pain below and showed the world a side of Burns that hadn't been seen since his triple double versus Rhombus in 1991. Burns gets women, has money and is the best keyboard player in the world. Yes, that should make you happy, but Burns is often misunderstood and his release \\"Keyboard Mosh Pit\\" sent a message that Burns isn't always smurfy. Enya sent that same message home on this platter.
B000A2W1X2|4.0|This is a very romantic movie. The uniting of Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane is magic. They are beautiful together. In the movie, Stephen Dillane's character wants to have an heir but his wife, who has been in a coma for years, decides to pay Sophie's character a fee to have his child. Their agreement is that he will take the child back to his home in England, and she will not ever see the child again. However, she eventually does, and it goes on from there. To me, this is a sweet and poignant film. And one of the best features of this movie is the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat. I had to buy it, when I bought the movie. <br /> <br />For romantics, this is a one-der-ful film. I would also recommend, with Stephen Dillane, \\"DeJaVu.\\"
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Philip J. Stevens wrote a pre-release review below titled \\"Not a Good Rush Album\\". He gave it one star, suggesting that Snakes & Arrows is a poor record. I'm not sure what the reference point was... bad in the absolute sense, or relative to Rush's most acclaimed recordings of yore? It's hard to tell.    Nevertheless, he lays down several adjectives regarding the new material that I am inclined to agree with for now, in particular: \\"plodding\\" (a related description - \\"lumbering\\" - was used to described Grace Under Pressure 23 years ago). He likens it to a hypothetical marriage between My Favorite Headache (Geddy Lee's 2000 solo release) and Vapor Trails, the last Rush studio album featuring new material. Much of my postnatal response to the new material, and to his comments, reeks of ambivalence. I think the material itself speaks to this, which will likely be borne out among the major reviews that come out over the next few weeks.    Part of me is inclined to give Snakes & Arrows a sub-par evaluation. The songs are indeed somewhat disjointed. Much of the album's nuance and vibe remains well below the speed limit per se. The mood tends to be brooding and introspective, which is fine in and of itself, and the vibe is distinctly mid-tempo. Now in their mid-50s, the members of Rush appear to have forsaken odd time signatures as well as striking tempo changes within a song. The \\"rush\\" so inherent in the old classic tunes (2112, Closer To The Heart, Hemispheres, Free Will, Spirit Of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Limelight, New World Man, The Big Money, Show Don't Tell, Cut To The Chase, etc.) is largely gone. Several current tracks do feature a quick tempo, but those segments for the most part feel more like somewhat uninspired jams... not nearly as imaginative as before. One notices an increasing reliance upon vocal overdubbing, which became quite prominent from Test For Echo on (1996).    Perhaps most obviously, no previous Rush album comes even close to featuring acoustic guitaras prominently  as on Snakes & Arrows. After just 2-3 listens, the acoustic presence begins to feel rather obligatory. Fans were already aware that Lifeson wrote all of his parts using acoustic guitar, an element he is quoted recently as being proud of (facilitated apparently by a recent discussion with David Gilmore last year). Very few followers assumed that the result would culminate in the presence of acoustic guitar on literally every track. At least half of these tunes feature some sort of unaccompanied acoustic bridge early on. This really tends to \\"slow down\\" many of the songs. All of this accounts for the sense of \\"plodding\\". I can't truly disagree.    On the other hand, let me suggest a number of highlights to this record. For starters, what's wrong with Rush branching out along every line mentioned above? Should we expect the same Rush, over and over again? What about growth and maturity? I'm not sure how realistic it is to expect a group of relatively elder statesmen to release records that sound like they were made by musicians in their 20s. One could state just as accurately that Rush has made yet another intriguing turn in its musical career: emphasis now on truly heartfelt lyrical philosophy, true \\"meaning\\" in each song, eclectic fusion of multiple styles not only in the context of Rush, but in general. In a sense, the record approximates a fusion of everything Rush has done in the past as well as the present, and then some. Hold Your Fire (1987), included a sleeve featuring elements of the album art from every previous Rush release. Snakes & Arrows manifests a similar tendency in the musical context, with no slight showing of their previous studio hommage to early influences (Feedback, 2004). A decidedly retro feel permeates much of Snakes & Arrows. There's nothing wrong with this and in fact, the most critically acclaimed bands in the world often receive accolades as a result.    Ever since drummer Neil Peart joined Rush just three weeks before their first U.S. tour (opening for Uriah Heap at the Civic Center in Pittsburgh, August 1974), the lyrics have taken on a decidely philosophical focus in tune with utilitarianism and an overall objectivist world view. Historically, Rush's work has been panned rather uniformly given the perception that the grandiosity of the lyrics surpasses what would normally be expected from three high school dropouts, hence the common label of \\"pretentious\\" (one reason for it, anyway). Perhaps this perception will change fundamentally with Snakes & Arrows. College degrees aren't necessarily prerequisite to insightful and artistic prose predicated upon lifelong experience, a fact that Peart's lyrics now support in spades. There isn't anything pretentious, wanna-be, or over the top about them whatsoever. Instead they come off as wise and sincere observation about the world we currently live in.    Moreover, one could argue that Geddy Lee's vocal ability - a lingering sore spot for some - has increased substantially on this album. He sounds very mature (not old) on Snakes & Arrows, increasingly proficient in his ability to phrase Peart's lyrics over any given Rush song. This new capacity is prevalent especially on \\"Working Them Angels\\", \\"Spindrift\\", \\"Far Cry\\", \\"Bravest Face\\", \\"Larger Bowl\\", and \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\".    The artistic and technical proficiency of each band member is quite apparent on Snakes & Arrows. All three members shine throughout. Alex Lifeson is all over the place in terms of style and he is an expert regardless of the genre. In fact, this could wind up representing his most accomplished work ever in terms of not only depth, but territorial breadth as well. Geddy Lee's bass masters the balance between supportive accompaniment and ingenius (as well as extremely dexterous) lead playing at a level rivaling, if not exceeding, his previous recorded performances. Neil Peart provides a typically excellent percussive contribution, although I don't hear much new from hisrepertoire. Yet he manages to not overplay, his meter is superb as usual, and the accents are placed very tastefully (e.g., he knows how to work around the vocal better than ever).    Last but not least, the recording of Snakes & Arrows is quite exceptional - far better than Vapor Trails, to say the least. Nick Raskulinecz (producer) and Rich Stychi (engineer) deserve kudos in terms of the sound of this new record. The separation and dynamics are downright impeccable. All three instruments sound absolutely gorgeous in the mix. I would rank this recording as second behind Moving Pictures, and just in front of Roll The Bones, Power Windows, Presto, and Permanent Waves (the latter in the context of its time). 2112, A Farewell To Kings, and Hemispheres sounded great as well, but the 70s era is so different that direct comparisons are probably unrealistic. Snakes & Arrows could well be their best recording ever. Lastly, the overall packaging (art, photography, layout, etc.) of the new release is quite exceptional. Although not nearly as important as the music, the overall quality of the product looks per se is a true delight for the senses.    In conclusion, Snakes & Arrows will likely attract an unusually mixed bag of reviews, including among diehard Rush fans. I anticipate it as being one of Rush's more \\"controversial\\" releases. Overall at this early juncture, I'm inclined to give it an even three stars - a rating that could change easily after a few more listens.    (Note: this review was posted originally on April 25th, 2007. As of May 2nd, I would give Snakes & Arrows four stars.)
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I was driving in Massachusetts and heard this cd on national public radio. A touch of Krissy Hines, sounds of Emmy Lou Harris, a great voice with a large vocal range. I've been listening non-stop to this CD, not a bad song to be found.  Although I was drawn to the CD when I heard the song Downpour, I think my favorite song is The Story, and also a catching rhythm with Have You Ever. The songwriting by Brandi and her twin guitarist is great.  I look forward to hearing many more songs from them. This music will last many generations. I have to go back now and listen to her first CD. Definitely worth the buy.

0679879269|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers that the whole battle with the Kingdom of Heaven wrapped up entirely too quickly and simply. And then you have a huge question of what's going on between the warring factions now that the leaders have destroyed each other. I agree also that it's not 100% clear what the temptation was and which way she went with it. But that's part of the reason it sticks with you. It's true there's no closure with the parents, but sometimes in life there's no closure and you just have to deal with it. It's also not 100% clear, or even implied that the kids had sex. I'm frankly surprised people assume they did. Were you ever 12-years-old in the woods? I was. And we just kissed alot. But it was alltheworld to us. <br /> <br />The rest is pretty satisfactory. I cried like a baby, I still get weepy when I think about it. I'm halfway through reading it to the kids and I know I'm going to cry again.
B000003TSP|3.0|I had seen two music videos for this CD and thought it was going to be great. After listening to all the tracks, I only liked maybe three. I am a heavy trip-hop and acid jazz fan, but this was just psychidelic junk.  It was like a whiny, down-beat version of aphex twin. I guess, if thats your thing... buy it NOW!
B000O178BY|5.0|So as a NIN fan I'm not what you would call normal, since I am not a big fan of their first two albums. Pretty Hate Machine didn't have enough \\"oomph\\" for me and The Downward Spiral got too experimental for my tastes.  <br /> <br />Then The Fragile hit. THAT is when I became a hardcore fan. It's one of the best albums I have ever heard. With Teeth is an album I can understand why people wouldn't like, and I understand the criticisms, but that album came at the right time for me so I really enjoy it. <br /> <br />Year Zero hits. I've had this CD repeating in my MP3 player for a week...and I honestly can't think of a single bad thing to say about it. It's got a lot of spontaneous experimental sounds, which work, none of them become overbearing or annoying. There's no track to me that sounds like filler or unnecessary. <br /> <br />Basically in short I am saying that I agree 100% with all the positive reviews of this album. Give it a try. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks: My Violent Heard, The Great Destroyer, God Given <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|3.0|To say I was underwhelmed by \\"Capote\\" is like saying two buildings were destroyed in New York on 9/11. After reading about this film for months and seeing Philip Seymour walk away with the statuette at the Oscars, I had high hopes for a drama built around real events. Turns out the dramatic part occurred, but without satisfaction for the high hopes.<br /><br />Among other things, this film is essentially a 110-minute whisper over one of the most startling real life events in the last half of the 20th century. Not only did the Nebraska murders teach the Midwest to lock their doors at night, it ushered in a new form of literature with the nonfiction novel. This had previously been introduced via Norman Mailer's work centering on World War II and Capote finished it off in the same way Alexander Graham Bell perfected the telephone that was invented by someone else.<br /><br />The history portrayed in the film was useful insofar as I had no idea Capote was also author of both \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" in novel and film treatment forms. I was also surprised to learn, through my own research while watching the movie, that Capote did not author another tome of much popular value outside it and \\"In Cold Blood\\".<br /><br />While Hoffman probably earned his award for this film, I recall the real Truman Capote and Hoffman ain't it. He is more a caricature of the real man, who was perhaps the ugliest man that ever lived in the United States. Hoffman not only presented a Richard Gere caricature of Capote, with his beautiful facial lines set against the real life Capote's egg-shaped head, his elegance and eloquence were more a match for a character at Tiffany's than for the real flesh and blood man.<br /><br />No matter, I suppose, for now this is a done deal and most people accepted it as the best characterization to date. Still, that characterization is rarely enough to carry the heavy weight of this film, which is bolstered by fine support from the likes of Chris Cooper. The wieight I refer to is the feature moving at a glacial pace in darkened scenes that mimic film noir.<br /><br />While perhaps captivating on the big screen in the mall, the molasses in February pace caused me jitters and unease watching at home. In addtion, the overriding darkness is metaphor to the ugliness of the story, no doubt, but still works against the film as entertainment. While leaving no doubt this is important stuff, it nonetheless comes off as more an exercise in doggedness than anything equivalent to fun.<br /><br />In prior films of the nature, including Cliff Robertson's Oscar-winning characterization as \\"Charly\\" and Al Pacino's prize as the blind tough guy in \\"Scent of A Woman\\" -- terrific portrayals inside similarly mediocre films -- the producers added life to the bland stories and critics didn't offer undeserved awards to the slow-moving beast of a movie.

B00005JNX0|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  The 'grown-up' humor is hilarious but well hidden from the youngsters.

0345298349|3.0|A friend highly recommended this book to me, which is perhaps why I was a little disappointed, as I had very high hopes when picking up this book.  While I did end up enjoying the story when I put the book down, it was not a favorite of mine, nor did it compel me to pick up any more of Smith's books.<br /><br />The reading was slow going for me for at least half of the book.  While, I normally throughly enjoy investigative, suspenseful type stories, this one didn't grab onto me quickly.  However, about halfway through it seemed to pick up, or perhaps I became accustom to the writing style or Arkady character.  Simply put, the plot kept me reading, because I did begin to care enough to see what would happen at the end.  I was glad that I did, I did start to enjoy the characters and story a bit more, and I was happy with the ending.  In addition, the book does not lack mystery and suspense.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad read, but not an author that I'd pick up again.  Just not my type, I don't think.

0913866156|5.0|Crowley broke ties with his former compatriots at the Golden Dawn and set out to turn the world on its collective ear. Along the way he created this breathtaking deck, with the gracious assistance of Lady Frieda Harris. This is an occult masterpiece of mythic proportions. It is his greatest work, and one of his few not riddled with lies and deceptions. It has been the tool of many a gifted reader and scores of magicians, prognosticators, charlatans, and even a few nefarious scoundrels of magic. It is alpha and omega - for it is both an extension of, and the counterpart to Waite's tarot.<br /><br />The feel is dark elegance, with heavy usage of blues and gold/yellows, with grays and greens finding their way into the backgrounds. It is not that there is ANY lack of other colors contained herein. The notation is a hint at Crowley's disposition affecting the implied symbolism of such usage in that it guided the direction of creation of this deck. this deck reeks energy, even before you pick it up - but it has a life of its own and you must fit the deck, or it will not 'behave.' Until you experience the bond (or aggravated agitation) possible with this deck, you simply have to guess at how dominant a force this can (and will) be in your readings and ritual use.<br /><br />This deck was specifically designed for ritual more than simple divination. Each card is a magical statement of human will over nature's wild (untamed) energies. In this way it clashed head on with Waite's vision of the magician in harmony. Just as there are many paths to your destination (whatever that may be) this deck is one of many. It either fits you, or it does not. But s to divinatory quality, none EXISTING [as of this writing] surpass this most excellent tool. I would not suggest this to anyone as a starter deck, as there is far too much occult (hidden) symbolism to learn of The Tarot that the novice cannot grasp from viewing these cards.<br /><br />Note: This card draws far more heavily on astrological influences than others (Waite for instance) but it is not at all an astrological construct. A great ritual tool that is also a quality divination device if you have a solid foundation of knowledge in the Tarot AND Astrology (and other sciences here unmentioned, should you be so inclined).

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is a fun family movie.  It's great on rainy days or in the car on the road.  Everyone loves this movie.
B0009P42V4|5.0|This movie blows away all its contenders! There are so many twists and turns and so many side adventures that I hardly see how anyone wouldn't love this movie! I usually do not like Muppet movies, but this particular movie makes you forget that you are watching puppets and it takes you away. David Bowie is good in this movie, but maybe they could have shaved a few of his songs off of the script, as well as a few of the other songs, but even with the slight overreliance on music, it was an awesome flick. Jennifer Conelly is a total honey too! lol
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I will never get tired of watching this movie!  There are loads of great one-liners too.  I definitely like this version the best.
B000E0W24S|5.0|I have to admit to not being one of Tchaikovsky's greatest fans.  It is one of those deadspots in one's love of music that I've no doubt is my loss.  A master melodist, certainly.  But I find him too repetitious; all that interminable sequencing seems more of a nervous habit than a genuine means of musical expression; and, yes, he does wear his highly Romantic heart on a sleeve that seems a little threadbare on real musical content for a symphonist.  So a recording has to go some to capture my attention, never mind my affection.<br /><br />These recordings certainly go some.  And then some more.  You'd be hard-pushed to find performances of anything that maintain such a white-hot level of intensity throughout three fairly long symphonies.<br /><br />When Mravinsky brought the Leningrad Philharmonic to the West in 1956, both conductor and orchestra were a pretty unknown quantity.  It was the height of the Cold War and, while a reputation preceded them, no-one was quite sure what to expect.  Mravinsky and his assistant, Kurt Sanderling, shared the conducting of these last three Tchaikovsky symphonies and recorded them in mono then.  Many people prefer those recordings  to these stereo remakes of 4 years later.  Personally, I prefer the later versions.  It's good sound for its period, if slightly edgy in a way that suits the Leningrad sound well.  It's in stereo.  And you get Mravinsky in all three symphonies.<br /><br />He is a master of this Russian repertoire - making it sound and feel very Russian indeed.  He is certainly not afraid of bending and shaping things to his individual view of the works.  There is usually a fairly heavy foot on the brake before lyrical second subjects.  There is an impetuosity about faster movements that often requires modifications of tempo later.  Rubato is frequent, often indulgent, but never wilful - it's always used to clarify texture, to give a melody its full weight or to emphasise structure (where there is structure rather than just a succession of events!).  The brass fanfares of the very opening of the Fourth Symphony will have you on the edge of your seat and you will likely stay there for the rest of the 2-disc set.  The pizzicato Scherzo has real style and panache.  And the Finale sets off at an absolutely electrifying zip - a zip which it maintains right through to the end.  And so it goes on through all these symphonies.  The Pathetique in particular comes across as a real symphony rather than a wallow in Russian morbidity.  There is huge power in the march.  And the Finale plumbs true depths.  Make no mistake: these are very special performances.<br /><br />Mravinsky had the reputation of being a dictator in front of an orchestra.  Certainly the sound that he produced from his Leningraders was very distinctive.  Compared to the homogeneity of sound that we get from today's international, jet-setting orchestras where they all sound like clones of each other, it is sad to see the passing of these `national' schools of orchestral timbre.  The Leningrad Philharmonic in those days boasted strong, virile yet warm string playing, an edgy tone to the woodwind that is excellent for penetrating dense orchestra textures (perhaps their instruments weren't top-notch and the lack of top-quality reeds in the Soviet Union may have had something to do with it, too), a certain stridency in the trumpet section and that totally unique Slav sound in the horns - lots of vibrato, slightly wobbly eve, but based, they said, on the human voice.  They all play like demons for their long-term conductor.  These are thrilling, moving, cogent, committed ensemble performances, all three.  And, while I don't yet count myself a complete convert to the Tchaikovsky cause, I'm certainly ready to proselytise on behalf of such exceptional music-making.than just a succession of events!).

B000696PWC|5.0|Sometimes I hate being an American!  This is my thought when I think about how enjoyable this 2 disc collection of Kylie Minogue's greatest hits really is!  Besides her LOCOMOTION and the FEVER ALBUM, America really heard little of Australia's princess in recent years! And what a shame that is!  I've always known her to be a gay icon but I took that status with a grain of salt since there is nothing gay men love then a hot pop diva, but ohhh I underestimated Kylie! <br />I bought the CD on my last trip to the UK and I have to say I was only familar with BETTER THE DEVIL YOU KNOW, which is still a favorite of mine with the most amazing dance beats, LOCOMOTION, I JUST CANT GET YOU OUTTA MY HEAD, I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, and COME INTO MY WORLD.  This CD has so much more to offer and it didn't take me long to discover the other gems on this CD! <br />SHOCKED, what can you say about a song that makes you incredibly happy and makes you dance like a maniac while driving to work everyday!  One of the best songs on the first disc.  Another favorite of the first disc is HAND ON YOUR HEART!  The melody on this song is soo catchy you'll be humming it through even the most stressful situations!  Other highlights of the first disc include, ESPECIALLY FOR YOU, JE NE SAIS PAS POURQUOI, and NEVER TOO LATE! <br /> <br />The second disc opens with a song that I was familar with but did not realize it was Miss Minogue!  I BELIEVE IN YOU may even be the strongest song on either one of the discs!  It is so unlike any other dance song I've danced/listened to and is infectious!  It will have you dancing in the most random of places!!  Of course you get the hits from the FEVER ALBUM such as CANT GET YOU OUTTA MY HEAD, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, COME INTO MY WORLD, AND IN YOUR EYES!  These songs really show how she's grown musically since 1987! <br /> <br />Other highlights on the 2nd disc are as follows RED BLOODED WOMAN, SPINNING AROUND (another song I'd heard before but neverconnected to Kylie and a great dance tune!!), PLEASE STAY, and BREATHE.  I even came to enjoy WHERE THE WILD ROSES GROW, not b/c its a bad song just b/c it is such a haunting song.  Kylie's vocals on the song even bring her into character as Eliza Day! <br /> <br />Finally, this CD is a must for any DIVA fan or fan of really ecclectic music!  Kylie lacks the \\"in your face\\"-ness of Madonna and has Cher's staying power!  She's magical!  Well worth the extra money for the \\"import\\" price!

0345494768|5.0|Overview<br /><br />This is a fantastic work, which spans the origins and creation of the film and includes insights into nearly every aspect of the filmmaking process. A true archive of both information and visuals, it is, in my opinion, a book that should be in the collection of every fan of the film. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />This review is broken down by the following group areas - Written Content, Visual Collateral, Presentation/Quality, and Overall Value - focuses on the perspective of the original prop hobbyist, in that sometimes we are looking for photos pertaining to real, original props and editorial content is of less interest; other times, in performing research, we may be seeking information more so than photos, etc.<br /><br />Written Content (10/10)<br /><br />This is, quite frankly, the most impressive and comprehensive Star Wars resource I have ever laid hands on. Whereas the legendary Star Wars Chronicles set the mark some time ago, in my opinion, in terms of visual collateral and photos, it had little by way of actual written content - just remarks about the stunning photography and images.<br /><br />This book matches the visual collateral in quality (though not sheer quantity) but far exceeds in the realm of pure information, narrative, background, insights, opinions, and more. You truly can't appreciate it until you begin flipping through this book - it's just astounding.<br /><br />If anything, the reader gains an appreciation for how impossible it seems to be that the final product is what it is, in that it was such a collaborative process that underwent constant change and alteration, and it had so much stacked against it throughout the creation of the film.<br /><br />As someone particularly interesting in story, character, and writing, I was especially captivated in following the development of the story and script itself, and its many and drastic changes.<br /><br />But I would say that there is definitely something for everyone in this work. There is focus given to special effects, models, creatures/masks, acting, production, post production - it's all here, in a format that encourages a bit of \\"flipping around\\".<br /><br />Visual Collateral (9/10)<br /><br />Of course, some of the photos have been seen before, in various publications and elsewhere. But there is so, so much I'd never personally seen. An incredible amount of \\"eye candy\\". Description just can't do it justice.<br /><br />Particularly interesting to me were some of the prototype props, such as the photos of the unpainted prototype R2D2 and the early lightsaber prototypes (think \\"flashlight\\").<br /><br />There is a substantial amount of behind the scenes material as well as sketches and artist renditions, photos of models, sets, workshops, actors, etc.<br /><br />As far as photos of actual props go, there are some excellent reference photos with great detail, which may be of some help to those lucky enough to have original pieces from A New Hope.<br /><br />Between this book and Star Wars Chronicles, I think any fan would be happy with the amount of material covered in both books.<br /><br />Presentation/Quality (9/10)<br /><br />It's a nice-looking, squareish hardcover book with a reflective yet not \\"fingerprint magnet\\" jacket. I usually take the jacket off right away (I find them annoying) and the actual book is all black textured material with a gold signature across the front (I assume George Lucas).<br /><br />The interior pages are of a high quality, and I get the impression it will hold up to handling quite well. Again, not of the \\"fingerprint magnet\\" variety (my biggest pet peeve with books - designed so as to discourage handling!).<br /><br />The content of the book is laid out in good order and there is at least one photo on every page in the book; though the \\"all photo(s)\\" pages are few and far between, which is a distinct departure from the Chronicles style. This is just as much about information as it is the visuals, and the visuals truly compliment the editorial content.<br /><br />Given the overall length of the book, things are broken up well enough to where you can read section by section or skip around based on interest.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the index. It is fairly comprehensive in listing actors and production members, as well as main characters, but is limited to mostly that (i.e. you can't look up \\"lightsaber\\" and find the references in the book). Not the biggest deal, but given how much content there is, going back and trying to find something after the fact is a huge challenge. An expanded index would have been a bonus, in that there is so much content to work through. One would truly have to read through the entire work once just to have an idea of how much is covered throughout the book.<br /><br />In summary, it is a beautiful \\"coffee book-style\\" piece that is difficult to put down once you start flipping through it.<br /><br />Overall Value (9/10)<br /><br />The retail price is $75, which seems like a lot for a book. However, Star Wars Chronicles was $150 in initial release, and was fewer pages (320 vs 372) though it was 100% full color with pull outs and a slip case.<br /><br />Given that it can be had via Amazon.com for $[...] and deeply discounted at other retailers as well, I think it is well worth the price of acquisition. It is a wealth of information, in a high quality book, with all full color photos throughout.<br /><br />Conclusion and Overall Rating (10/10)<br /><br />I would characterize this book as a \\"must have\\" for any Star Wars fan. It is a fantastic book with an incredible about of both written and visual content, much of which is unique to this release. Along with Star Wars Chronicles, I would say these are the two books any serious Star Wars fans should have in their library. Highly recommended. I can count the books in my collection that I would rate a \\"10\\" overall on one hand, and I have a pretty extensive library.

B00013RC66|4.0|BLACK WIDOW is a sexy and stylish thriller, mainly notable for the always-reliable Debra Winger playing a gutsy female investigator.<br /><br />When several rich older men all die in sudden, bizarre circumstances, government investigator Alexandra Bates (Debra Winger) becomes convinced a common link will lead to one individual.  Alex's theory later leads her across the path of Theresa (Catherine Russell), a woman with untold fortunes and several husbands.  Determined that she is the 'Black Widow', Alex befriends her in Hawaii, and later becomes part of a sordid love triangle with the next intended victim of Catherine's plot.  BLACK WIDOW is filled with enough chills and thrills to hook any audience.<br /><br />Debra Winger, in one of the rare times she doesn't play the dying tragedienne, delivers an excellent performance as Alex, a woman trying to exist within the male-dominated world of government intelligence.  She is the only one who truly holds this movie together.  Catherine Russell brings a chilling, glacial quality to the role of Theresa/Rennie, the black widow of the title.  The cast also features Diane Ladd, Sami Frey, Nicol Williamson, Dennis Hopper, James Hong, and Mary Woronov.
B00000255F|5.0|Not a huge Bruce fan.  Moreso because i was born in 1986 and the only songs i ever really heard of him was all of his new stuff, and some of the overplayed songs that came off his \\"landmark\\" recording Born In The USA.  To me, he hit his stride early with this amazing album.  With a song like THUNDER ROAD, how can it not be amazing, the title in itself blows you away. The title track is amazing, as is more or less every other track here.  Honestly if you are questioning if getting into Bruce is worth your time, don't bank on Born in the USA to change your mind. Look back at Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town.  These are the albums that will move you, and my guess is that the songs on USA already make you sick and if they don't listen to classic rock radio for a day or two and then they will.  Just my opinion

Both using time travel, this film is much more plausible. 'Deja Vu' has a head that leads the heart with the latter picture working in reverse.  The screenplay and technology pave the way to past and present that suspends our disbelief with greater ease in this outing.  The dialogue and development are much more solid with a romantic bond between the hero and his leading lady.  The chase scenes and investigative scenes complement one another without a wasted moment.  'Deja Vu' draws from mind bending innovations--like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'--even if it is more mainstream, but remains a better exercise for both heart and mind.
0307120007|2.0|Got this book for my son when he was about 11 months old.  He was mildly interested the first couple of times but, has shown little to no interest since.  I should have had him check out a copy in a book store first.  The artwork seems a bit dated and the colors lacks any vibrancy (is that a word?).

1400079179|5.0|It rather amazes me how much controversy this one book has raised amongst both Catholic and Evangelical Fundamentalist Christians around the world. Dan Brown is not a preacher, a pastor, evangelist, or even a Sunday school teacher. Yet his words have conjured up such a retaliatory position from the church that it really makes you wonder if he's on to something.  The book is a wonderful read.  Brown is an exceptionally great writer and storyteller. He skillfully mixes fact and fiction together with artistry and colorful skillfulness. How he presents the controversial issues provokes meaningful thought and much discussion.  I believe that Brown may be on to something here; the church at large obviously believes that also, which is why they seek to censor his voice.  Although Brown does not claim to hold any clerical office in the church, from his writing he may be functioning as a modern day prophet and not even know it. Masterful writing!
0743289684|5.0|Societies must be judged on the human rights it guarantees to its citizens. The subjugation of even one person by law - or conveniently skirting laws that have been written - to any form of slavery is the acceptance of institutionalized hatred.<br /><br />This is a chilling autobiography by Ayaan Hirsi Ali which concerns the sickening human rights violations of women and the systematic trampling of basic freedoms through the Qur'an. She pounds away at the enslavement of women and the intolerance to other religions/cultures.<br /><br />In history, appeasement has proven to be a failure time and time again. Without each person having the individual freedom of the mind, body and soul, there will need to be heroes like Hirsi Ali to remind the world where the political priorities must re-focused each day.
B00005JPD0|5.0|People complaining about plot holes in this movie need to think to the obvious (present) impossibility to even accurately portray time travel. To every answer there is to a time travel question there is a contradictory one.  This film did the best in portraying a situation of time travel. While there are contradictions to every result of the movie, every other movie about time travel doesn't recover as well (I'm thinking of you Timeline).  <br /> <br />The acting is great (Adam Goldberg does great as Denny). The visual effects and qualities are great. And there are enough questions lingering (up until the end) to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this movie.

1582701709|4.0|Clearly stated, the Secret is a wonderful book unlocking the truthful treasures of ancient mysticism. All of the mystics of antiquity including Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammad, all employed this most cherished tool, the law of attraction.  It is the only thing that really makes manifest anything that is or will ever become in this earth realm. As to the critics of this work, losers will be losers. This work is not for losers or for people that do not use their minds to think both critically and spiritually.  The poverty minded individual will immediately condemn this work and say such things as, \\"all they want is your money\\", when in all reality most authors do not make enough money to even make ends meet. The true writer writes for the love of writing and communicating their thoughts to the masses. In all reality, books such as this one, challenge people to begin to recondition their minds and think more proactively about the things that they desire to have and become, not about the things, which they lack.  That process brings good into one's life.  This is a great introduction.  A far more detailed book that unfolds the truths in the Secret is in Bishop E. Bernard Jordan's, The Laws of Thinking--a perfect companion to the secret. If you love the secret you are probably and winner. If it does not resonate with you, then you are probably losing in every area of your life. Wake up and win!
B00005QK3W|5.0|Out of the long list of McCartney Albums, this one definitley stands out. Alot of McCartney albums have a feeling of mediocracy first time around, but then begin to grow on the listen as he/she listens again. This album is quite different. From the track one to track sixteen, the album just keeps pulling the listener deeper and deeper, leaving the them wanting to hear more. Personally, I feel that the flaw of some McCartney albums is that the lyrics aren't thought out as much as they could (it sometimes feels that he goes for quantity rather than quality). Driving Rain is a host of top notch songs (both lyrically and musically).

This book takes something rooted in reality and instead of explaining it, calls it magic.  They figured as long as they are inserting magic into the equation, they may as well make it all powerful too.    The Secret:   Thoughts --> mystical, magical stuff --> Things happen to you solely based on your thoughts, nothing else    Reality:   Thoughts --> Create actions and human interactions --> Creates reactions from others and the world in general --> Things happen to you  and sometimes, things just happen    Furthermore:    The Secret: Nothing is outside your control.  If you die in a plane crash, it was because of your thoughts (literally stated in the book).    Reality: Some things are outside your control, some are not.  You choose how to respond in thought and action.  Your actions can have influence in most cases, especially in human relations.  Reciprocity is a psychological and sociological function, not magic.    Healthy:  Believing that everything that happens in your life is your responsibility TO DEAL WITH.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|\\"The Pursuit of Happiness\\" tells the story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a lower middle class black man whose dream of prosperity is evaporating. He and his wife invested heavily in a portable bone densitometer, but sales are horrible and the family is just a step ahead of eviction. Slowly but surely, Chris loses nearly everything, until he is left almost literally with nothing but his young son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) and the clothes on his back. By luck, he connects with a group of E.F. Hutton employees and starts a long and uncertain trip out of his predicament.<br /><br />The film does a phenomenal job of communicating just how difficult it can be to rise from the margins, even if one is talented and ambitious. Gardner must feed and house his son while studying for a soul-crushing investment exam, showing up to work fresh every day and managing child care. The difficulties he faces are enormous and daunting, and would have deterred many a less hardy soul.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />But from a filmic perspective, there were problems. How many close calls can a viewer endure without getting irritated? And using the name of a real investment firm pretty much gives away the ending. Then too, there was the lack of emotional intensity between the characters, with the exception of Jaden, who was delightful and real throughout. One had to wonder as well about the likelihood that a man who washed himself in subway bathrooms could be fresh -- both mentally and aromatically - every day for months. And without once cutting corners in the childcare area.<br /><br />\\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" is a fine movie that depicts the experience of individuals who are dogged about achieving their dreams. But it does so at the cost of its own integrity, shortchanging the damage that such a pursuit, no matter how well-motivated, has on those around them. By the end of the film, I was unconvinced by Chris Gardner's sterling character and mistrustful of the depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.
0385474547|5.0|In this fascinating book, three generations of a Nigerian tribal family are ruthlessly displayed. A feeble father grows old and is replaced by his stronger, wealthy son, Okonkwo. Okonkwo's son follows more after his artistic grandfather, although he has never met him. Eventually Okonkwo and his three wives and all his children are banished from their home. When they return nothing is the same. They've heard rumors of the white demons that have invaded their land, but now the strength of the devotion of their fellow native Nigerians is almost overwhelming. The real story is what follows and how the families and tribes work together in a newly developing Christian world. <br /> <br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is an amazing story of trial and triumph. It shows the strength of a people that we don't understand. Chinua Achebe is an amazing man who, through his writing, has given an ignorant nation, and world, insight into something that we don't understand. It shows the folly of white missionaries and how they have hurt the societies that they enter. It is an amazing book which everyone should read again and again. <br />
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|I am a Doors nut.  The movie came out when I was 13 and I have been addicted from that point on.  I digress.  I wanted to suggest to those Doors fans who are angry about the music being re-mastered to buy the re-mixes because they are interesting and pretty affordable.  You probably already have the 1999 re-masters, (and for that matter records, reel to reel, 8-tracks, cassettes, and the 1990 cd versions), well maybe you're not that much of a Doors nut, anyway I digress again.  What I have done when I have bought these re-masters is to listen to the re-mix version first, then listen to the 1999 re-masters immediately afterwords.  I have always been interested in music production and engineering and I love the new re-mixes, but I will not get rid of my 1999 re-masters because I want to have both versions of these great albums. I know it sounds crazy, but I would like to have re-masters of \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" too. <br />Why not, they are not bad albums, just without Jim.  I think that if you're going to re-master and re-mix your album catalog, you should complete the task.
B000EHSVQ4|3.0|Its a pity that this film has been slated so much but sadly that probably has more to do with ongoing political events than the actual quality of the film.

Troy was just so damn awful nobody cared if it was historically accurate or not.<br /><br />Does the film keep your attention? Yes.  Are the battle scenes well directed? Yes.  Does the film give you a feel of the time and place that this was all taking place? Yes.  Has the director chosen the right actors for the role? Yes.

B000JJRIN4|1.0|The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|First of all Al Gore is a politician and not a scientist.  He is a professional at trying to seize money and power for personal gain.  If you want to educate yourself on this topic I am sure there are better books to buy written by people who actually understand this complicated subject.<br /><br />Secondly the presentation is second rate, lackluster, and boring.  It is really just a lecture given by Al Gore himself with really no interesting footage whatsoever.  Public television documentaries on science such as NOVA or NATURE are usually much better done and more factual.<br /><br />Thirdly Al Gore himself doesn't believe the things he says in this movie.  He practices an unenvironmental friendly lifestyle.  Reports indicate that he uses up twenty times more energy than the average American.  This leads one to question his motives and I doubt they are altruistic.  Do the proceeds he receives from this movie go to bettering the environment.  I doubt it.<br /><br />Why this won an Oscar is beyond me because it is not factual, creative, interesting, or enlightening.<br /><br />I wish that some knowledgeable scientist would step up to the plate and do a much better job presenting  this controversial issue.
6304708491|3.0|The singing scenes of this movie are worth remembering and each time you see them, these guys glisten. Theres George Harrison singing \\"I Need You\\" very well. This is definitely a very unserious movie but much of it a classic to keep. \\"Another Girl\\" belongs to Paul McCartney, he sings it way cool and draws the line. Ringo is royal to the beat. John Lennon is naughty and inquisitive. These guys never let me down. They're just a downright great band and fascinating!
B00005JPPI|3.0|FRACTURE seemed from the trailer and the ads as though this was a surefire hit, a mystery thriller populated with a strong cast and directed by Gregory Hoblit (Hart's War,  Frequency,  Fallen,  Primal Fear) who knows his way around tense drama.  But despite this the movie suffers from a script that fails to keep that secret that would make the story work: most viewers will be able to figure out the `mystery' far before its discovery poses the end of the film.<br /><br />Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is an older wealthy man married for a year to a younger beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and happens to spy on her with her current paramour, detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke), confronts her at home and shoots her in the face with the intention of killing her.  But of course she is not dead: she is in a vegetative state in a hospital ICU by the next frame.  Meanwhile a young lawyer Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) while working for the District Attorney office with Joe Labruto (David Strathairn) sniffs that all is not right with the case while at the same time vying his career choices with transferring to a law firm under the eye of Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike).  Willy is assigned to prosecute Crawford, but Crawford, defending himself, is acquitted because the murder weapon (gun) cannot be produced.  THAT is the mystery: what happened to the needed evidence?  The remainder of the story is how Willy solves the case and while most people will have figured it out, revealing it in a review robs potential viewers from the cat and mouse game the film is supposed to be.<br /><br />Both Hopkins and Gosling are superb, even with a script that is weak, and simply watching them perform is reason enough to see the film.  The sets and filming are also fascinating and the pacing of the movie is satisfyingly tense.  With a bit more imagination the story could have worked better. The `stars rating' is for the Stars!

B0007TKH66|3.0|If you can make it past the bizarre Diane Warren theme song (don't know what they were thinking!), the first two seasons of Enterprise are pretty mediocre, but stick with it!  Season 3 & 4 are really good!  All the things done in the first two seasons that make no sense (like the emotional vulcan) will start to make sense in very interesting ways. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, by then, most people (myself included) had stopped watching and the show on television and it was cancelled.  I wish network execs would be a little more patient!  Or they should release things on dvd quicker, so people can catch up and get hooked.  I miss the days of long summer reruns when I could catch up on shows I didn't get to see because they were up against other favorites. <br /> <br />Jonathan Archer is no Picard or Kirk, he's somewhat one dimentional, but after 9/11 (filmed during season 3) his character comes to life.
B000003TSP|5.0|For the sole reason that this album far transcends the poppy undertones of Dummy, I give it a 5/5. <br /> <br />That being said, I'd still like to give a track-by-track review of this product. <br /> <br />SHORTEST TRACK: Half Day Closing (also one of the best) <br />LONGEST TRACK: Humming (another favorite of mine) <br /> <br />Cowboys: You can't help but feel the eerie opening to this album pulsate in your mind as the first kick drum hits grace your eardrums. Beth sings in a screeching tone of voice, almost scornful, giving this song an intensity unmatched by previous songs. My only gripe is that it loses its bass after those initial drumstrikes. 9/10 <br /> <br />All Mine: An enjoyably simple bump, its lyrics are hard-hitting and possessive (Tethered and tied/there's nowhere to hide from me). 9/10 <br /> <br />Undenied: Starts with a moody 55-second instrumental (I love it!), then Beth's lyrics come in as a contrast to the last song (this one is about losing love rather than keeping love close). 10/10 <br /> <br />Half Day Closing: The confusing beat and heavy distortion on the instruments and lyrics (at one point, Beth's voice sounds like a distorted guitar!) make this one quite dark and heavy. The lyrics are about the changing times, and how innocence has been lost. 10/10 <br /> <br />Over: Starts off with a creepy acoustic guitar, then builds into a strange ballad with heavy drums that burst with string hits. The lyrics match the atmosphere; they are equally creepy. 9/10 <br /> <br />Humming: My favorite on the album (and luckily, the longest!) It starts off with a cliché UFO-style humming (hence the title) accompanied by what sounds like reversed strings, then the beat blasts in at 1:30 with lyrics that seem to be about sex. 10.5/10! <br /> <br />Mourning Air: Soft and sad, this song is about holding on tight to love, at risk of slipping into depression. A pretty amazing track. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Seven Months: I don't like this one as much as the others, but it still packs a punch. The scornful lyrics accompany its beat well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Only You: The most credited samples lie in this track, but are not too noticeable, as samples are in other tracks. The lyrics are stunning, and Beth sings them with passion. 10/10 <br /> <br />Elysium: The name of the track means \\"paradise,\\" but the lyrics are about hate and self-hate, which makes for another one of those title-lyric contrasts that can make or break an album. This one makes it! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Western Eyes: This song is the most friendly on the album, but certainly still darker than those on Dummy. The sample at the end goes well with the beat, but it should have been placed elsewhere in the song, IMO. 10/10 <br /> <br />Final verdict: 10/10 <br /> <br />I love this album, and it arrived at my house promptly and in excellent condition. Thank you!

B000NQR7NO|5.0|British rock act Arctic Monkeys return with the follow up to their massively hyped debut, which set the record as the fastest selling debut in UK chart history (going on to sell over a million).<br /><br />The tendency is for one to rush and say \\"Favourite worst nightmare\\" either falls below expectations, or, is far superior to their debut. Truth is, it is neither; it is just as good as their debut, which is great news if you (like millions did) loved that one.<br /><br />Short, frenetic bursts of brilliance, with very clever lyrics, though this time, the songs are less abrasive and more tuneful.<br /><br />Lead off single \\"Brianstorm\\" sounds like it should be an atonal clutter of noise, but is surprisingly a danceable, catchy number, faintly akin to \\"When the sun goes down\\" from their debut.<br /><br />There isn't a shortage of great tracks; \\"D is for dangerous\\", \\"Balaclava\\" (fantastic machinegun-like guitars and a spit fire vocal delivery), the highly melodic \\"Fluorescent adolescent\\", the woozy \\"Do me a favour\\", \\"This house is a circus\\" (with what could pass for a soccer stadium chorus towards the end), the energetic \\"The bad thing\\", and the utterly brilliant \\"Old yellow bricks\\" (awesome guitar riff, and hugely danceable) which The Killers or Franz Ferdinand would kill for. My absolute favourite cut.<br /><br />Slowing things down are the melancholic acoustic ballad \\"Only ones who knows\\" (with some ghostly effects), and closing cut \\"505\\" (about the stress of maintaining a relationship while on the road touring) which starts off brooding but gets rockier towards the end. Again, fantastic guitar work!<br /><br />Already headed for another massive debut at #1 in the UK (currently outselling the entire top 20 in it's first week), you can safely say The Arctic Monkeys have successfully avoided the dreaded sophomore slump. Brilliant!!!
0307346609|1.0|When I read Brooks' Complete Zombie Survival Guide, I literally could not put it down until I had read the whole thing. So naturally I was excited to see World War Z on the new release book shelf when it came out and purchased it immediately. <br />I'll be candid and short, this book f****** sucks zombie genitalia. Don't waste your time or money on this complete bore of a book. Aside from the obvious political slant that I take offense to in the writing, the entire thing is just plain boring. What a complete and utter waste of a good concept.

B000O75F7C|5.0|For many, this is one of the big albums to watch  in 2007. In certain circles, at any rate, there has been a lot of rather assuming talk, with phrases like potential `album of the year' thrown around. Ancillary to this, some of us were privileged enough to hear the entire thing in rough, prototype form live last year, and the textures and dynamics evident in some of the entrancing music we heard that evening certainly suggested something special waiting in the wings. Finally, a lot has been made of the fact that (supposedly) this album functions as one continuous 50-minute cycle of music, and that the lyrics deal pretty much exclusively with Wilson's fears that the younger generation is risking descent into intellectual torpor owing to their addiction to an oh-so lethal cocktail of prescription drugs, MTV, internet addiction and banal culture of necessary instant gratification.<br /><br />For me, however, none of the above really has much bearing on the album itself. Sonically, the six pieces here (which are distinct enough not to flow together the way, say Light of Day, Day of Darkness does) present an interesting proposition. Crucially, the narcotic core of their sound has been left largely intact, with outrageously catchy melodies, dense, layered and painstakingly executed production, careful, wandering bass-lines and lush, intricate harmonies all present in abundance. There is a slightly more heavy approach evident, but overall the album is remarkably spacey and dreamy, with a lot of attention given to synth washes, soundscapes and somnambulistic melodies, all rather reminiscent of their The Sky Moves Sideways era. But this is juxtaposed with the tight songwriting and straightforward riffing of later releases. If their are any new elements, and I'm inclined to say there are, they emerge in subtle ways: Wilson's vocals, which have changed little over recent years, seem more brazen and stretched, while some of the melodies seem more intricate, more assured and composed, and take time for the listener to fully appreciate.<br /><br />The title track turns on a riff that is highly reminiscent of `Deadwing', while the chorus has a kind of gentle brutality that is somewhat jarring. The rhythmic vocals over the verse have an interesting, pseudo-rap like quality. The outro is dreamy and unexpected. `My Ashes' is stunning, with that perfect verse/chorus interplay Wilson excels at, lush orchestration and nebulous, highly evocative lyrics. The wordless vocal which rounds off the song engenders a kind of urbane emotional atmosphere, a beautiful dignity.<br /><br />And then to `Anesthetize', which stands well out of the crowd simply by virtue of being 17 minutes long! Live, this track was instantly memorable and impressive, and here it does not disappoint. Wilson seems to have shoehorned just about every facet of his remarkable music making skills inside. The four minute introduction is sinister, haunting and deceptively melodic. The four to around 11 minute mark is utterly replete with intricacies, yet never overblown: indeed, it displays an uncanny use of shifting dynamics and sustained tension, of the kind Tool have often used so effectively. A slow build is embellished by an ornate Alex Lifeson solo with a welcome exotic tinge, before the heavy riffing slides into view, along with a great, eerie verse and one of their most breathtaking choruses. Then we are hit with something pretty surprising at 11 minutes - suffice to say the song implodes in spectacular fashion, and the excellent outro is ushered in, all sepia tinged sunsets and darkened skies.<br /><br />To follow that, the gorgeous `Sentimental' harks back to earlier albums slightly, with an intro reminiscent of `Collapse the Light Into Earth', and a breakdown towards the end which re-introduces the riff from `Trains' in slightly moderated form, a happening I've not entirely figured out. Despite this, the gentle lilt of the chorus is possibly Wilson's most effective evocation of sheer melancholy (no mean feat!). `Way Out of Here' is perhaps the most interesting song, a kind of psychedelic metal experiment, although `Sleep Together' pushes it close, a kind of apocalyptic industrial tinged nightmare, with lyrics seeming to equate suicide with sexual release.<br /><br />Maybe not as much a massive leap forward then, as a consolidation, and certainly a near flawless, very tightly constructed album with  a lot of depth, as the whole picture will take quite a lot of listens to emerge. Including only six songs does ensure welcome brevity and consistency. In many ways, which perhaps I've not entirely made apparent, this is their most complex record; at any rate, it is certainly extremely dense. Whether it is their best record, or album of the year is, however, open to debate. Nevertheless, it comes highly recommended.(no mean feat!). `Way Out of Here' is perhaps the most interesting song, a kind of psychedelic metal experiment, although `Sleep Together' pushes it close, a kind of apocalyptic industrial tinged nightmare, with lyrics seeming to equate suicide with sexual release. <br />Maybe not as much a massive leap forward then, as a consolidation, and certainly a near flawless, very tightly constructed album with  a lot of depth, as the whole picture will take quite a lot of listens to emerge.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|From beginning to end, the Jupiter and Mars disks are both amazing, one of my favorite albums of all time (It's hard to compare it with Californication, because there are way more songs on this album, but definately one of their greatest yet.) <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is their best album.  hands down, no argument there. <br /> <br />The bass has taken another step down, not that the talent has declined, just that you're starting to hear more of Frusciante and less of Flea.  and if you're strictly an old-school pepper fan, this cd may not be for you, other than 4 or 5 songs. <br /> <br />In regards to the guitar, this may be the best album yet, though Californication and By the way were amazing as well. <br /> <br />some songs that haven't been played by radio that you MUST hear... <br /> <br />-Slow Cheetah.  Rocks you slowly, steadily. It hooks you in lyrically. <br />-Torture Me.  Quick paced, then slow paced.  You need a breath when it's all over. <br />-Strip My Mind.  Not everyone's favorite, but one of mine.  Almost bluesy in some ways, really helps you reflect on why they wrote this song. <br />-Especially in Michigan.  Excellent song, I'll leave it at that. <br />-C'mon Girl.  Somewhat trippy, you'll love it while \\"under the influence\\" <br />-Hey.  I don't like this song too much, but the band is very proud of this song. <br /> <br /> <br />-21st Century.  Flea is back! <br />-She Looks to Me.  Lyrically, one of their best songs ever. <br />-Readymade.  Fast paced, you'll like it if you're \\"old-school\\" <br />-Make you feel better.  One of the best songs on the album.  Everything comes together perfectly in this one. It really does make you feel better! <br />-Storm in a Teacup.  Another fast paced song.  Excellent solos near the end. <br />-We Believe.  It'll make you want to sing. <br />-Turn it again.  Frusciante's bread & butter. <br />-Death of a Martian.  Not an amazing song in my opinion, but it has good meaning to it.  It has to do with Flea's dog, Martian, who died while they were recording the album.  Lyrically, another great song. <br /> <br />If you've been a peppers fan from beginning to end and you haven't gotten this album yet, you should be ashamed of yourself.
0345494768|5.0|... will be the most amazing, fantastic thing you could ever hope for but you know it probably WON'T be and then when it finally does come out it leaves you feeling dissatisfied and even a little jaded? <br /> <br />NOT THIS BOOK. Just thumbing through it quickly today after it arrived (sadly it's pouring out so it is sitting on my desk at work, safe and dry) made me nearly as excited as I was on that line outside the old RKO Keith's theater (Flushing, NY) way back a long, long time ago...  <br /> <br />There are a lot of wonderful photographs and art pieces, but what I find even more wonderful is that there is SO MUCH to READ, and not in that 14 point type so many impressive-looking books use to fill up space with as little real content as possible - this baby has a 10pt typeface (I'm pretty sure it's 10.) That might sound silly, but I'm sure someone out there understands. We're talking comprehensive here.  <br /> <br />Don't wait for paperback, don't wait for used - this is absolutely worth the price. If you can, get two, so you can have one in the bookcase/on the table, and one you can take from room to room with you to read and savor without worrying about keeping it pristine. <br /> <br />This is the 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' of books about Star Wars.
B000067CPX|3.0|Say what you want, the Peppers have kicked out way better albums than this one, I'll make a quick ratings list for ya, from best to worst. <br /> <br />1. Californication <br />2. Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik <br />3. Stadium Arcadium (very close to BSSM, though) <br />4. Uplift Mofo Party Plan <br />5. Mother's Milk <br />6. Freaky Styley <br />7. BY THE WAY (yea, that's right) <br />8. The other albums are not worth mentioning. <br /> <br />I simply wasn't impressed.  Maybe I got a little spoiled from Californication, but bottom line is that all these other albums had some ballads, alotta funk, and some hard rock.  This album is missing a couple key ingredients from RHCP.  They simply aren't hard enough, and should have a warning label in that regard. <br /> <br />all that said, i'll note some songs that were good. <br /> <br />-By the Way.  Way to go Flea! You made this song what it is. <br />-Dosed. <br />-Zephyr Song.  You can feel it, lyrically and spiritually. <br />-Can't Stop.  Good jams. <br />-On Mercury.  There's those old roots showing again. <br /> <br />For most bands today, this would be a breakout album.  Not for Red Hot, though.  For the Peppers, this is sub-par.

B00000J7JO|5.0|Were you angered by the end of \\"One Hot Minute\\"? <br /> <br />Fear not, the Peppers are back. <br /> <br />The music has changed, no doubt... but for their own sake, it was for the better.  How many energy-funk songs can you produce before everyone calls you a one trick pony? <br /> <br />Frusciante makes the difference here, along with Kiedis's much improved lyrics, filled with meaning, unlike Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik.  (which was an excellent album, but lyrically not nearly the best <br /> <br />Californication proves that the boys can still rock it out hard and slowly put you into a trance at the same time.  The music has changed, but it is still phenominal. <br /> <br /> <br />Noting the songs, one by one... <br /> <br />-Around the World.  Perfect example of my last paragraph.  They picked a perfect song to kick off the album, with Flea kicking in heavily. <br />- Parallel Universe.  Trippy, good bass lines, excellent solos, one of the harder songs, they really kick out the jams here. <br />-Scar Tissue.  You've all heard it.  Chillin', yet catchy. <br />-Otherside.  Again, you've all heard it. <br />-Get on Top.  WOW!  what a song... they kick out the jams once again, and slow it up around the chorus, but not too much, it keeps you jumping. <br />-Californication.  You've all heard it.  Excellent song. <br />-Easily.  Lyrically, one of their best.  Not much funk, more of an alt. rock, and it's filled with deep meaning. <br />-Porcelain.  An utter disappointment.  The only song I didn't like. <br />-Emit Remmus.  They hit a little bit of a rut here with this song and the last one, i don't care much for this one either. <br />-I Like Dirt.  Kinda hard, but not really.  It's an average song, kinda sticks in your head. <br />-This Velvet Glove.  Another song filled with meaning.  Most of them are when the peppers talk of addiction.  Not very fast-paced, but still good. <br />-Savior.  The idea itself is great.  They're talking about Frusciante's return to the band.  What a relief. <br />-Purple Stain.  WARNING!  THIS SONG WILL STICK IN YOUR HEAD!  My favorite on this album, it will be yours too if you love that catchy funk style.  Extremely trippy as well. <br />-Right on Time.  Quick paced, shortest song on the album.  Still impresses, fast to slow, and then back to fast again, it's catchy. <br />-Road Trippin'.  More of a ballad, rocks you slowly.  Good way to end the album.
0345477618|5.0|There are so many books and films about this now-classic film that it's hard to imagine that anything published in 2007 could bring anything new to the table. There was a made-for-TV special with the same title, but believe it or not, no companion book ever came out for the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie -- just every other film in the series.<br /><br />The beauty of this thick volume is the in-depth, candid look at the production *before* anyone knew it was a hit. The interviews and notes are almost entirely from 1975 and 1976, which really gives you a flavor for how crazy/brave/pioneering/enterprising young George Lucas was when he fought to make the film.<br /><br />Writing and production quality is excellent, but it's the content that really shines here. I have the paperback version, which is an excellent value from Amazon, but apparently the hardcover edition has even more exclusive content.<br /><br />This book is strongly recommended for any fan of the series, the genre, or filmmaking in general. You'll want to watch the documentary \\"Star Wars: Empire of Dreams\\" again after seeing this, too .... set some time aside to geek out with your sideburns out.
B000255LIY|2.0|I gave this version of this excellent play two stars solely for the quality of the staging but this film is SLOW. While it is well acted, with excellent cinematography and set design, the director has done a very poor job because it drags and drags and lacks any of the crispness of the original.  In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  Close and Stewart played Henry and Eleanor as truly estranged enemies who were sincerely plotting each other's destruction.  This may have been closer to the historical truth (but who really knows?)but it simply wasn't fun or interesting.  The play rests entirely on the repartee between Eleanor and Henry and the rapier wit of the two but alas this was missing in this version.  The entire film was stagey and filled with pregnant pauses which killed the pace and wit.  The Hepburn O'Toole version is much better because it is filmed in a more intimate way plus Hepburn and O'Toole play the characters as truly loving each other but people who cannot stop being King and Queen with totally different agendas.  The Lion2 was a big disappointment.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril Lavigne is one of today's most successful new artist. She stormed on the scene back in 2002 with the ubiquitous hit \\"Complicated\\", making her debut album LET GO go six times platinum if I'm not mistaken.  Her second album, UNDER MY SKIN, didn't hit as hard as her debut, but became her first #1 debut and managed to be another multiplatinum success with the most notable hit single, \\"My Happy Ending\\". After so much success, one had to ask where Avril's third album would bring her.  The answer is to punk-pop at its very finest.  With help from her husband Derrick Whibley (Sum 41), Avril makes perhaps one of 2007's finest albums in my opinion. 2007 has produced some great material, but THE BEST DAMN THING just may literally be one of \\"the best damn things\\" of 2007.  Consistency is top notch here, helping to craft the greatness that turns out to be THE BEST DAMN THING.<br /><br />The album opens with Avril's hit single, \\"Girlfriend\\", which is certainly catchier than \\"My Happy Ending\\" by all means.  The sound is completely different from her UNDER MY SKIN singles, which I think works highly in Lavigne's favor. Even greater than the three minutes that makes up girlfriends is the peppy \\"I Can Do It Better\\" which features stacked screamed background vocals that are literally to die for. The uptempo factor of THE BEST DAMN THIS is great, and makes perhaps all the difference between this album and her previous album, which didn't sound like this. \\"Runaway\\" is only a slight downgrade from the first two tracks, and when I say \\"slight\\" I mean \\"slight\\"; it is a very strong track. Stronger are the two tracks that follow, the incredible title track (\\"The Best Damn Thing\\") and my personal favorite of the album, \\"When You're Gone\\".  Sure on \\"When You're Gone\\", Avril's vocals aren't incredibly \\"robust\\", but the vocal production puts Avril's whiny, somewhat thin sounding vocals in a very high light, making her sound particularly exceptional here.<br /><br />\\"Everything Back But You\\" proves to be the sixth straight hit, while \\"Hot\\" and \\"Innocence\\" are both strong, if not exceptional compared to the best tracks of THE BEST DAMN THING. \\"I Don't Have To Try\\" is another great number, while \\"One of Those Girls\\" and \\"Contagious\\" are also pretty \\"damn\\" consistent.  Sure, none of the above are quite as powerful or as potent as \\"Girlfriend\\", \\"I Can Do Better\\", or such caliber tracks, but they are all solid. The concluding track, \\"Keep Holding On\\" is exceptional, and ends perhaps one of the finest albums I've heard in 2007.  It is brief (at only 40 minutes), and perhaps because it is so \\"tight\\" in it's structure, that is perhaps why it is so fine.  Great album in my opinion with only minute flaws. 4 stars.ut You\\" proves to be the sixth straight hit, while \\"Hot\\" and \\"Innocence\\" are both strong, if not exceptional compared to the best tracks of THE BEST DAMN THING. \\"I Don't Have To Try\\" is another great number, while \\"One of Those Girls\\" and \\"Contagious\\" are also pretty \\"damn\\" consistent.

B00005176F|5.0|While Blur were the undisputable kings of 1990s Britpop, on this side of the pond Blur were virtually unknown outside of alternative rock circles.  While the band had considerable success in the UK racking up hit after hit they scarcely charted in the states even though their songs popped up here and there, including commercials.  \\"The Best of\\" bundles those UK hits spanning 1990 to 2000, which should go a long way towards establishing Blur's hit-making credentials with US listeners.  \\"Best of\\" aptly demonstrates Blur's musical capability and songwriting prowess and showcases the wide variety of musical styles they could strike, from the moody atmospherics of \\"She's So High,\\" and \\"To the End,\\" to the heavy metal of \\"Song 2,\\" the eclecticism of \\"Tender,\\" the melodic catchiness of \\"Coffee and TV,\\" and \\"There's No Other Way,\\" and the downright nutty \\"Boys and Girls,\\" and \\"Country House.\\" \\"The Best of\\" pulls in 18 of Blur's biggest hits and throws in a bonus second ten track live CD of their 1999 Wembley show covering many of these same tracks; a great starting point for a casual listener or for someone just starting to dig into Blur's oeuvre.<br /><br />Indeed these tracks show Blur to be probably one of the best musical acts in recent years, definitely in the same milieu as the Kinks and the Beatles, yet not mindlessly aping either of those groups and at the same time showing a true spark of originality that is all their own.  If anything \\"The Best of\\" SHOWS THAT Blur remained consistently good throughout their career, while other groups burned out or put out rubbish.  Consistently satisfying from start to finish, \\"The Best of\\" truly earns that title.
B000GG4XJM|2.0|Springsteen is a quasi-folk singer with poor diction that doesn't know what the meaning of traditional music is. Excuse me, but throwing in everything from the kitchen sink doesn't make the music more interesting. It only makes it weird. Nothing sits right with this album. The traditional instruments are mixed with brass instruments and a cheap drum-set that add nothing to the traditional songs of American nostalgia. Nothing needs to be added to the songs if one really appreciates traditional songs as they are traditionally sung and played. This album has tried to popularize traditional music so as to make it palatable to the general public who generally doesn't appreciate the real thing. It might make your toe tap while you listen to it, but so does any rhythm in the universe.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|this is better than most of the \\"sophisticated\\" multi-layer screenplays that seem to be the rage these days, but it still feels as tho it were written backwards: characters act less out of motivation than as if they are pre-destined, and that constitutes a sore point for me. if you like this kind of writing, this is a good example. strong performances all roud, but so help me, id have preferred to see just one of these plot lines more fully developed. a special kudo to gustavo santolaella for his perfect musical score. overrated, but still worth seeing. <br />
B000O178BY|4.0|All hail the returning king of industrial/goth/techno/self-depracating music, Trent Reznor and his band, nine inch nails! To be honest, I was beginning to get a little worried about Trent and his songwriting capabilities. I mean, I know he's got the gift in him. No man could release such great albums as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"Broken,\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and not help but have more to offer. But when \\"The Fragile\\" hit the masses, despite its epic enormity and rave reviews from critics, old and new, I couldn't help but feel that Reznor's style was quickly diminishing. To me, \\"The Fragile\\" simply lacked that same driving force of lyrics and nitroglycerine-injected beats that its predecessors had in abundance; however, I love the tracks \\"The Day the World Went Away\\" and \\"Star*******, Inc.\\" You could tell Reznor was experimenting with a new sound. And while experimentation is expected from any musician, he or she should still have enough insight to know what works and what doesn't. \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" did not work.<br /><br />However, nine inch nails' newest release, \\"Year Zero,\\" has Reznor returning to much of the style and beats that first caught our attention back in November 1989, but also with some of the experimental music he's toying with lately. And all I have to say is: it's about time! The only major difference is Reznor's subject matter in his lyrics. Instead of ranting about unrequited love and relationships gone bad, \\"Year Zero\\" finds Reznor broadening his horizons with most of the lyrics focusing on political and overall world environmentalism. Most NIN fans may cringe at the idea of such topics being put into heavy industrial metal music, but only Reznor can do it without any pretension or hokeyness. The first track, \\"Hyperpower,\\" is a short instrumental with what sounds like a percussion beat of thunder with driving guitars just to give you a feel for what kind of album to expect: nine inch nails are back and they're not taking any stuff from anyone!<br /><br />Next, \\"The Beginning of the End\\" begins with a drumbeat and dives into a guitar chord and Reznor's usual distorted voice that makes most appreciate his rare, catchy sound. This is a short song but it rings out the beginning of the end for what we can only imagine is Reznor's dystopian future nation. \\"Survivalism\\" transitions us more towards the NIN future world and shouts in the chorus make me think that the singer is one of the unusual inhabitants who doesn't mind the world crumbling down around him. In fact, he seems to have foreseen this horrible future and is blasting the audience he's talking to (maybe President Bush or any of the politicians currently in office; or maybe us for keeping these individuals in office for so long).<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"The Good Soldier,\\" has a more content Reznor singing from the perspective of a soldier stationed overseas in hostile territory. The lyrics speak for themselves and are so to-the-point that it's not difficult to comprehend; that Reznor is speaking of the current stationing of our soldiers in Iraq. And like most entertainers, he's not too happy or idealistic about our presence over there. This song instantly transitions into the next, \\"Vessel,\\" which is a bit weird in its meaning `cause I can't help but think that what, at first, sounds like reference to a drug eventually grows into something bigger - as if the singer is referencing religion as a whole. \\"Vessel\\" is a weird song for me because I like parts I didn't think I'd like and don't like parts I thought I would like. For instance, the vocals are OK but the best part is the instrumental of noise nearing the end.<br /><br />\\"Me, I'm Not\\" continues the slightly silent noise with Reznor entering with normal vocals speaking of a transformation. It's never fully described what Reznor is becoming or attempting to keep inside, but the listener automatically knows it can't be that good by the constant stalking, monotonous noise lingering throughout a loop of various noises. From the beginning of \\"Capital G,\\" you can tell this is the song that is meant to be a radio single. The singer talks about electing the President to office (as is known by the title: G standing for a particular leader of the free world) and how screwed up the nation has become because of it. All in all, I like this track a lot. It's one of the best sounding tracks on the album. However, the following is probably my favorite on the entire album.<br /><br />\\"My Violent Heart\\" begins silent with a looping synth sample and Reznor's vocals at the most quiet on the entire album. He darkly sings as if he's some killer sentenced to death and giving his disturbing profession of he and his cohorts rising through anarchy, hate and violence to one day overcome the masses. The transition of quiet to loud within this song is enough to get the blood pumping in anyone and I often find myself hitting repeat on this track very often. The next track, \\"The Warning,\\" is what I would imagine if Reznor was foretelling an alien race transmitting a signal to Earth. The transmission beats, soon overcome by Reznor's sampled voice is dreadful (in a good, catchy way) and it lends to the apprehension of the song - as it's exactly what it's title implies: a warning. The warning basically is that if we don't get ourselves together, we're in a heap of trouble.<br /><br />Track ten is \\"God Given\\" and it's Reznor's confession at how profound and, yet also, how hypocritical religion can sometimes be. The vocals remind me again of something from \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (think \\"Sin\\"), and it's a great addition to the album that is complete Reznor fashion. \\"Meet Your Master\\" continues this Reznor fashion with pulsating vocals and industrial beats set to lyrics dealing with facing consequences of one's actions. Yet again, here is that early reference I was making to modern-day politics as the actions in this song are of electing officials to power who have taken this country in the wrong direction. Although an OK song, luckily, \\"The Greater Good\\" follows. I thought the vocals would be awesome, but the instrumental, industrial beats become the defining work of this underrated masterpiece. They drown out any lyrics and you find yourself actually moving along to the beats.<br /><br />Although a decent song, \\"The Great Destroyer\\" doesn't stand out too much and it's merely a bleep leading the way toward the excellent instrumental \\"Another Version of the Truth,\\" which is the best instrumental NIN has done since \\"A Warm Place\\" on their \\"The Downward Spiral\\" album. \\"Another Version\\" begins with a quiet, steady progression of strings and goes into a melancholy, yet romantic tone. Overall, a great piece of work! The second-to-last song, \\"In This Twilight,\\" is a song centering on a man talking his thoughts out loud to someone he cares about on the eve of Armageddon. It's a haunting song and Reznor's lyrics continue to reference environmentalism abandoned as the song perfectly captures the frenzied emotions one must face when contemplating one's own demise. Lastly, there's \\"Zero-Sum,\\" which continues the dread of our end, but with Reznor's distinct style of idealism as he sings to his subject (maybe the woman he loves), \\"And I guess I just wanted to tell you/As the light starts to fade/And I guess I just wanted to mention/As the heavens will fall/We will be together soon if we/Will be anything at all.\\" The lyrics are amazing and Reznor has hit a new high with these last two songs and I'm almost bummed that there isn't any more album left.<br /><br />\\"Year Zero\\" not only has nine inch nails returning to the music I've missed and craved for all these years since \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" it also has sounds that new fans will also appreciate and want to play over and over. Being in my early 30s and a father, I'm not as cynical as I used to be. But with Trent Reznor and nine inch nails' new release, you don't really have to be in order to enjoy it. He makes time for global issues - particularly environmental, religious and political - and packages them nicely. I only hope Reznor and company keep up their faster pace of pumping out albums.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|it is difficult to separate your politics from your aesthetic sense, so i wont pretend to. but as a movie in and of itself this works brilliantly. i wish i had not gone in already among the congregation, because id be interested to see if i were a bit more open minded (or alternatively closed minded on the opposite side) if i would have been convinced. while al gore was not a good candidate, he IS an excellent lecturer and lays out the case re global warming as well as it can be made. the movie deserves to be seen by every one, even if you disagree with the basic premise. <br />
B000BP86OG|1.0|I read somewhere that The Darkness almost broke up after the success of their first CD. They should have if this is their idea of a follow-up. Where did the fun and great riffs of Permission to Land go? These songs are awful. They wander round and round and never go anywhere. Instead of the silly lyrics of the first CD, sometimes here they try to sound serious and end up sounding ridiculous. The music is trying hard to be Queen but that's a unique style and hard to pull off. The Darkness come away sounding as if they have no idea how to write a song. They should have stuck to the straight ahead approach they employed for Permission to Land. This was one of the worst music purchases I ever made.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|while there have been several scorsese movies ive liked more, im glad he finally got that oscar -- if only so i no longer have to hear the bewailing that hes never won one from people who claim they dont think it means anything anyway. that said, this is a fine (if a trifle too lengthy) gangster flick, highlighted by strong performanes all-round, especially by mark wahlberg. betrayals and triple-crosses abound to the point that you almost HAVE to have guessed one or more of the outcomes, but its a dizzying ride on the T to anguish. <br />
B00001U0DP|5.0|From the beginning of the film Italian director Robert Benigni's `Life is Beautiful' is easily identified as a masterpiece. A tale of fantasy and humor in the heart of Nazi occupied Italy, this film is centered around the fanciful story of Guido, the films central character. Guido, (Roberto Benigni) is a young Jewish librarian who lives in a world of his own fantasy. He is witty, imaginative, hilarious, a little crazy, and in a state of constant bliss. From his riddles to his endearments to his stories, Guido displays a childlike innocence that captures the heart of any person- and in the movie, captures the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) his \\"principessa\\" (princess) and wife.<br /><br /> The movie changes from a romantic comedy to a sarcastic tragedy as Guido and his son Giosu&eacute; are taken to a concentration camp by the Nazi officials that occupy Italy at the time. However, despite this depressing turn of events, it is there in the horror of the camps that the magic of Benigni's story takes flight. In order to save his son's sanity, Guido invents a game for Giosu&eacute; to believe/play while they are in the camp. From a complex point system, to mean candy-hogging guards, to a grand prize of a real tank, Guido lets his imagination soar as he fills Giosu&eacute;'s mind with stories and promises. This absurd paradigm shift is not only hilarious, but also provides a window into the depths of the human heart, which can endure all things when the light of hope is present. This part of the movie was also the most engaging, viewers will find themselves at the edge of their seats feeling as if they were also part of the game, and when Guido fumbles in his explanations you might unexpectedly hear a random helpful suggestion coming from your movie-buddy's lips.<br /><br />Benigni's amazing ability to involve the audience in the plot of the movie was one of main reasons why La Vita &eacute; Bella won four academy awards in 1998. Moreover, Benigni also ties one more element into the story and the characters of Guido and Giosu&eacute;- the music. Throughout their entire time in the concentration camp, the music of the movie remains happy and uplifting. Despite the hardships and cruel reality of life, the optimistic music represents the story Giosu&eacute; believes. This is another great example of Benigni's gift to blend all aspects of cinematography- the characters, plot, scenery, music, and the reactions of the audience- in order to make the movie a complete and unique experience for the audience.<br /><br />Because of its light representation, `Life is Beautiful' is a movie that can be seen by all audiences and I strongly recommend watching this film in its native Italian language with English subtitles. The experience, emotions, and representations do not carry the same meaning in American versions, and yes much does get lost in the translation. I also recommend watching this movie with a friend, it's a very moving film and it helps to have somebody's shoulder near you to cry on. I hope you enjoy this masterpiece just as much as I did and are able to pick out the many double-meanings in the dialogue to get the most out of your experience.<br /><br />Laugh, cry, love, watch, enjoy, and help Guido help you find the beauty of life...y and the characters of Guido and Giosué- the music.

B000002LUB|5.0|Let's hope that the new CD - The Dio Years will prompt more people to check this one out, the last time these 4 guys got together. The selections chosen from Dehumanizer for the new one are good but hardly represent the best of it. First of all, Dehumanizer rocks. The production is awesome, probably the best produced CD I have heard. Aside from the superior talent of the four members, the sound is just phenomenal. It will blow the grills off your speakers! Play it loud and you'll see what I mean. As soon as those drums kick in on Computer God it's sonic labotomy time. Speaking of Computer God, that would have been a far better choice for The Dio Years CD than After All, a good song in its own right, but not the caliber of Computer God, an epic track. Another standout is Time Machine which we get to hear twice on Dehumanizer, once being the album track and one being the track recorded for Waynes World. Basically, there are no weak points on here and well worth a second look 15 years later. Lyically & musically it stands the test of time.  <br />
B000O178BY|2.0|I'm sorry but this album is no creative masterpiece.  Compared to most of the crap that comes out these days it is OK at best.  To put this album up there with Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Fragile and The Downward Spiral...  HELL NO.  With Teeth sucked especially the singles off of that album.  This album IS better than With Teeth, but that is about all it has going for it.  I guess if you were 8 years old in 1994 you might think that these albums are great, but the Nine Inch Nails glory days are over.  It's almost as if he is afraid to make loud abrasive music again.  If he put as much energy and thought into the music of this album as he did in the concept of it, it might be good.
B000O75F7C|5.0|POO to the naysayers, you guys are overthinking it!  I don't need a whole lot of fancy words to try and describe FoaBP, AWESOME does just fine!!  <br /> <br />These guys are consummate artists and they need to grow.  I'm so glad SW left the normal album format and the radio-friendly songs off this time!  <br /> <br />Keep surprising us, Steven, keep us on our toes trying to keep up with you, the REAL fans love it!!   <br /> <br />And to the reviewer who stated that SW was dumping on the kids a little too hard, he's not dumping on the kids at all, he's explaining them!!  He's ranting against what the adults (and the current state of our society) are doing to them and you know he's right!!!   <br /> <br />This past week has gone down in history for me...an excellent Nails album and an excellent PTree album within days of each other, who could ask for more??! <br /> <br />Get this, people, it will blow you away!  Then get every other thing PT has ever done, you won't be sorry!
0679746323|4.0|\\"Mao; The Unknown Story\\" is an astounding piece of work that delves into the depths of the Mao's atrocities and the highs of Mao's success at making China a superpower. The amount of research that has gone into this book is astounding. It seem as though every hour of Mao's life has been covered. If there was ever to be a comprehensive book on Mao's life then this is it. If you haven't studied into the subject of Mao Tse-tung, then I suggest that you start from this book, everything else seems supplementary.<br />The only area that the authors don't deal with is politics. While the basic political information of China during Mao's life time is discussed, it is not comprehensive. Clearly the focus of the book isn't the political climate, but Mao in general. If you are interested in the politics of China during Mao's life time I would suggest to look elsewhere.<br />I have read a few reviews that have stated the book is biased and is aimed at only demonizing Mao. Even if this was the case, I doubt the atrocities that Mao committed could ever be exaggerated. It always pays to keep your mind open to different interpretations, but overall everything has come from eyewitnesses, not from the authors imagination.<br />\\"Mao\\" is written in an attractive style, and is often hard to put down. Never in the huge 814 pages was I waiting for the end to arrive. The authors immerse you in details that give you a feeling of what the peasants went through.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, highly recommended.

B000I2J76I|3.0|Before controversial religious films, arrests for being drunk amongst other things, and lots of negative press reared their ugly heads, Mel Gibson was one of the biggest stars in the film world. Personally I haven't liked a couple of his films so far (Mad Max - apart from the leather trousers) but Braveheart more than makes up for. Yes I know it's cliched, but I love that story! Soppy romantic at heart here, hi!<br /><br />I was not that keen on the first Lethal Weapon movie, but this one was a lot exciting, apart from the South African politics. And Mel's hair. What's worse, that or his hair in Braveheart? Let me ponder that for a while.<br /><br />About half way through - okay, the scene with Danny Glover sitting on the toilet - I realised I'd already seen it many years ago! Back in the *good* old days of high school, when nothing could ever replace video, and my mate and me had nothing better to do that rent Mel Gibson movies. And of course I remembered Miss Wooden, Patsy Kensit. (She's starring in some British TV shows and she still hasn't taken any acting classes.) Her final scene still freaks me out in the film as it does when I was at high school. I still didn't remember that much of it - I definitely didn't remember Joe Pesci's character being that irritating! SIT! STAY!<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 2 is better than the first, and all the better for watching in HD - beats video anyday - but I still feel the ending felt ever so slightly wrong. He was meant to be killed off at the end, and it does feel like he should have been, rather than survive. But I guess the director saw dollar signs before his eyes, and made two more, which according to my boyfriend, sound pretty dismal. There are some scenes for the ladeez of Mel with a certain lack of clothes, so enjoy. And Patsy Kensit for the guys. It's definitely the better of the two.
B000O75F7C|4.0|This is the PT that made an indellible mark on alternative music back in the '90s. I don't understand the abject disappointment I'm reading from 'fans', but I'm not surprised that newcomers are a bit put off. <br /> <br />One thing is for sure, this is not a song oriented release. This definately harkens back to the glory days of their Pink Floyd influence. Don't think this one will win any converts, but it should please PT fans. Seems really short but its still 50+ minutes long.  <br /> <br />Don't know if I'd say it was better than the other two. It's definately old fashioned PT, but I miss some of the elements present in the last few albums. Gone are the all out rockers of Deadwing, like Open Car, Shallow and Halo. None of the pop splendor of past songs, like Piano Lessons, Shesmovedon, Rest Will Flow, Trains and Lazarus, are present either. The song, Sentimental is as close to a single as you're gonna get on this album, and it is a good song, with a piano lead-in reminiscent of Collapse The Light Into Earth, from In Ansentia, albeit a bit faster tempo. The last track, Sleep together has some rather dumb lyrics, but also some glorious string arrangement not heard on a PT album to this point. <br /> <br />There is still raucus jamming and ambient rock ala In Absentia. Some superb musicianship and production as well. Wilson is indeed a studio wizard. The strings on the last track, Sleep Together, are mesmerizing. Fans that aren't familiar with albums like Signify or Sky Moves Sideways will be scratching their heads though. <br /> <br />All in all, a great excuse to lower brain activity to simple autonomic functioning for 50 minutes. <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|There are so many things I could rant and rave about, but I should probably just choose a few because otherwise I'd be here all day. First, the acting/choice of actors. Let's start with the most noteable (and most fun to talk about :)). Richard Armitage as John Thornton is now one of my favorite 19th century heroes. I love his raw emotion! His acting has such a genuine quality to it. Daniela Denby-Ashe is a wonderful Magaret Hale. I can't put my finger on what, exactly, is so good about her performance, it just fits. I like that both of these actors are good looking, but not so attractive that it makes the rest of us feel intimidated. It's their personalities that draw me in, not their looks. Although their appearances do help... especially in the case of Mr. Armitage, whom I can't help noticing is incredibly fine, me being a mortal female.  Also I have to mention Fanny Thornton. I don't know the name of the actress who plays her, but she did a fantastic job. She cracks me up. And (forgive me if I misspell it) Sinead Cusack, who plays Fanny and John's mother, did a very noticeably good job.  The story of course is wonderful. I love the plot turns! And the score is perfect. The music is almost haunting; it fits the story quite well. For those of you have read the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, this adaption stays fairly close to it. There are a few liberties taken but all in all it's a very accurate adaption, much of it word-for-word with what happens in the book.  I could go on for days, but that most likely would not be received well by anyone reading this. So, I will finish by saying that this is an AMAZING film,  it's one of my very favorites! I highly recommend it.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I had heard the songs once, performed live during the last tour, and I was immediately blown away. I had remembered FOABP and Anesthetize, but with time and no other listens, I wasn't sure what to expect. The album has more than lived up to my expectations. Usually, as some others have commented, it takes a few listens, but this one took one! <br /> <br />I know that this will sound strange to some, but this is the easiest PT album to listen to. Yes, parts of it are very heavy. However, it is very melodic heavy music with some amazing drumming by Gavin Harrison. In other words, a couple of heavy songs on In Absentia, as much as I love that album, are more difficult to digest, in my opinion, than anything on here.  <br /> <br />Now, if you fell in love with this band through Sky Moves Sideways or Up the Downstair, you may want to give it a listen before you buy it just to make sure that you will like it. There is still quite a bit of that ambient rock on here, but there is more metal and even some industrial rock on FOABP and Anesthetize, and I know that some people are not into metal, regardless of how melodic it sounds. I love those other albums as well, but this is different. <br /> <br />Steven Wilson and company have obviously put in a lot of thought into this album, and come up with another masterpiece. Hope you all enjoy it! <br />
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I love Avril. I love that she writes and produces all her own songs, started off songwriting and released her 1st album at such an early age. \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" Is just as good as the 1st album \\"Let GO\\" but perhaps better. She has grown, she enjoyed the success of \\"Let GO\\" and then released \\"Under My Skin\\" This album was terrific, but didn't sell as good, people thought, she was trying to be somone out of her skin when in reality this is who she is. And it suits her just fine. So she went back to writing and singing songs like when she 1st hit the scene. You have to appreciate Avril, she has some serious balads. \\"Keep Holding On\\" is just as Beautiful as the song she wrote that Kelly Clarkson sang \\"BreakAway\\"...<br /><br />Go ahead and get this album and sit down pull out the lyrics and read along to her new songs, and you will crack up and bang your head to her catchy tunes.<br /><br />I did...<br /><br /> She might be married, but she is live and vivacious! ROCK ON AVRIL!!!
B00005JPCF|2.0|At the risk of having my review receive low ratings of \\"helpfulness\\", I won't say what has already been said before in other negative reviews (I will assume that you have already read many of them). However, I do have something to add that I haven't seen expressed here yet.<br /><br />I do agree that this movie's storyline is completely lacking and that it is far too scary and sexually suggestive for young viewers. But I would also add that my husband and I were both shocked to find a sequence in the movie that was so blatently sexual that we had to rewind it several times to see if we were seeing it correctly. I think it is at the beginning of track 8.... when Mubble and Gloria both jump out of the water together at the same time, they end up bumping into one another and then in their attempts to right themselves from falling, they end up positioning themselves into several \\"karma sutra\\" style sexual postions ... obviously in an attempt to make adults laugh or to create some subliminal stimulation. (IF YOU DON't BELIEVE ME, PLEASE CHECK IT OUT!)<br /><br />Though I thought the movie was of poor quality already, at this point, I was downright angry. Not only does my son not need to fill his head or waste his growing years on this kind of junk ... (extremely scary sequences and political manipulation included) ... but he certainly does not need sexual suggestion in his Toddler years.<br /><br />I got rid of this movie and feel good about that. It has no value. I highly recommend March of the Penguins - which, though it also has an environmental message, I can appreciate its forthrightness, lack of manipulation, natural talk of reproduction, as well as a storyline that we can follow. [[ASIN:B000BI5KV0 March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />Thank you, Jodi
B000J4QWMC|3.0|The Mann touches brought to the screen version of TV's \\"Miami Vice\\" almost make up for an improvised, sloppy introduction to the new incarnations of Tubbs and Crockett (Farr and Ferrell). The sweeping cigarette boat shots (day or night), the celestial flying shots and art deco light baths upon the drug thugs remind us of the unrivaled camera work of his recent films. One would hope after \\"Heat,\\" Mann could give greater depth to the romantic entanglements that make more sense than the drug deals this time around. In failing to explain the dual love interest time, Crocett's squeeze (Gong Li) becomes a minor distraction, slowing the inevitable climax of a choreographed gun show that actually delivers the goods. A Mamet rewrite could have shown Mann the way to spring Tubbs and Crockett to a less predictable,surprising denouement; instead they get overshadowed by other agents. On TV Crockett and Tubbs tested Lt. Castillo often; here, they seemed to be chained to their superiors, which leads me to call this \\"Miami Vice-Chained.\\"
B000E9910W|5.0|Since I moved abroad and needed to rebuild my cd collection, the Doobies were a big gap.  This collection goes a long way to filling that gap.  My iPod has been set to play this almost continually the last week.  It captures the variety of styles that the Doobies encompassed, from the California folk rock beginnings to the jazzier, rockier Michael MacDonald era.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I can't say enough about this film---it's got everything and is presented artfully.  Just get it and watch it with an open heart.  It's amazing.
B000002U8G|5.0|Many have said this is where it all started, and they are right. A brilliant album top to bottom. If you just getting into Pink Floyd and you like DSOTM and the Wall, this is as far back as you need to go. This is where the sound that they became in the 70's started taking full form.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish. The story line has been bashed by other reviewers but I think it's a cool little movie and a lot of fun. <br />The sound and picture of this Blu-Ray disc are truly amazing. <br />If you are a fan of animation then this is one for the collection... Yes sir.
B000002UA0|2.0|I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic. But I just do not get it. I highly overrated album IMO. Very childlike and underdeveloped, but maybe that is its charm? I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This title is worth every penny. And it does play on the Xbox 360 HD DVD add on. You have to be connected to Xbox Live and it will download an update that will allow this title to play correctly. It also works fine on the stand alone HD DVD players(HD-A1, HD-A2, and HD-XA2) I have.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Yes, buy the album! Though the album is not set for release until May 1st, I have received a copy through a local radio station contest \\"Win it before you can buy it\\" promo. This album is a mix of Vapor Trails, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures. The best track by far on this album, \\"Spin Drift\\" is a spacey psychedelic feast for the ears and is a bit reminiscent of Witch Hunt and is really unlike anything RUSH has done before.  What is different about this album, is that there are THREE instrumentals consisting of - \\"The Main Monkey business\\", the acoustic power ballad \\"Hope\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\", all of which are superb and leave you wanting more! Probably the most odd of the tracks is \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" Which starts out as a heavy blues riff, and sounds like B.B. King high on a compound mixture of Viagra, Adderral and Ecstasy, but then shortly shifts into a heavy groove hitting classic rush tune. The song is a bit confusing, musically, (shifting from blues to rock and then to blues again) but it works and is definatly an original that only Rush can pull off!! Geddy's bass work is absolutely phenominal, with a lower \\"Tool\\" bass sound, and Alex never ceasing to amaze me with his complex, yet groove hitting guitar riffs! Neil compliments the album, though not as much as a presence as heard on previous Rush albums (is Neil mellowing out?). Definately a 3 star album!
B000002UVX|5.0|This music is about spirituality.  Be a critic of a bird and you aren't seeing the bird.  That is your mind is telling you a lot of garbage others told your mind concerning birds.  Let go of what you \\"know,\\" listen to Band of Gypsys, dig that \\"Message of Love.\\"  GodblessU.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|Leonardo is in South America learning to be a better leader.  Raphael and the others are still in Manhattan, but he is distant from Donatello and Michelangelo.  He is spending his nights as the Nightwatcher, a superhero who is protecting the city.  Soon, strange things start happening, and April O'Neil, friend of the turtles, tries to get them back together to fight this new menace.<br /><br />Using the live action movies from the 90's as a vague history, this CGI film jumps right into the story and doesn't let up until the end.  This is my first turtles movie, but I have to think that CGI treats them better than the live action movies did.  There are no limits to the fight scenes and camera angles as they bound across the city.  \\"TMNT\\" was surprisingly good and entertaining.  Kids and action fans will not be disappointed.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Unfortunately, I have not seen the classic version of this movie yet. In fact, I didn't even know it was a re-make.<br /><br />It's an early 90's rags to riches, love story. Like Pretty Woman without the hooker part. I feel that Julia Ormond had terrific chemistry with Harrison Ford. It even made me have little flutters when I anticipated a kiss.<br /><br />I love this movie!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I watched part of a PBS documentary about Auschwitz last week.  After the first two hours I found myself restless and eventually had to change the channel.  At a certain point it just becomes too much.  I did catch an interesting comment by an Historian who said (I'm paraphrasing) that we learn nothing from the Holocaust and that all interest in its details were gratuitous and bordering on ghoulish.  He then said that that didn't change the fact that it was everyone's responsibility to educate themselves about it.  Sorry for the long build up, but I believe this film (and the book of course) prove that statement to be incorrect.  We continue to learn from the survivors of the Holocaust, and while some of what we learn is ugly and necessary, there is also beauty and towering triumph in the tales of their survival.  There is a bit of both in this film.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|It took me a year to finally discover what everyone has been raving about -- the new British discovery Corinne Bailey Rae.  I first saw her on the Grammy Awards televised show, but her segment that day really didn't spotlight her unique talents, and WHAT talents this young lady has !!   <br /> <br />When I first heard \\"Put Your Records On\\" on the radio, she immediately struck me as someone comparable to Norah Jones, but with repeated listens and the strong material on this CD, Ms. Rae actually shows more versatility and range than Norah Jones.  It's unfortunate \\"Corinne Bailey Rae\\" struck out at the Grammys.  Corinne lost in the major categories to the Dixie Chicks and I can't even remember who won \\"Best New Artist\\", but Corinne should have won that one. <br /> <br />\\"Put Your Records On\\" is a feel-good song reminiscent of the 1970's with its pop-funk-soul vibe, and Ms. Bailey's voice is like a ray of sunshine that permeates thru every track on this wonderful CD.  But just when you think her voice is all sugary and sweet, she'll let out a growl or grunt to make you think otherwise.  I just hope her follow-up CD will be just as good, but at the rate this CD is still dominating radio airplay here in Southern California, I'm sure it'll be a while before Corinne heads back into the studio for the follow up.   <br /> <br />In this day and age when marketing, hype and scandal plague young musical artists, it's nice to see a fresh, confident, and creative singer still making waves for the right reasons.  Get this CD -- it is sooooo good and worth every penny!  Your ears, heart, and mind will Thank You.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|Forbidden Planet uses (what was at the time) the fairly fresh concept of the id and the subconscious mind described by Freud and weaves a magical story around it in the context of an advanced, but unfortunate alien race, the Krell, undone by a technology meant to manifest thought into matter. But heck, that's just the storyline. There's much more: a whiskey synthesizing robot; Krell metal, Krell music; monsters and blasters; Leslie Nielsen as Captain Kirk's role model; sexual tension; great special effects; lots of great Theremin music; Walter Pigeon's incredible voice -- and shot in Technicolor, it's just gorgeous besides. If I had to pick just one film to wear the tasseled fez of \\"the classic SF film\\", this would be it.  I would have loved to have seen this film as a kid on the big screen on some hot Saturday afternoon, a thing of popcorn and a box of Junior Mints on my lap. Pure Heaven.  The film has very high production values and the art direction and the special effects alone could (almost) carry it. But the story is a conceptual masterpiece as well. It's the idea that our primitive brain, our id in the Freudian lexicon, is the entity in true control of our behavior, and if fed with enough juice can become an unstoppable destructive force, melting its way through exactly 36 inches of immutable Krell metal to tear and kill. SF doesn't get much better. There's no telling how much SF that followed it was inspired or influenced by this wonderful film.
B000O75F7C|4.0|I discovered PT with In Absentia. Since then I have seen them live twice and am about to see them again in about 3 weeks.  Deadwing to me is their masterpiece so far. FOABP is another wonderful effort but it definitely is more atmospheric and ethereal than Deadwing. I was hoping for a couple of real \\"standout\\" songs like HALO and SHALLOW from Deadwing but there's nothing here that really does that.  I myself like the heavy stuff alongside the incredible musicianship. Gavin Harrison has fast become my favorite drummer and on this CD he approaches Virgil Donati territory. Incredible stuff. One thing I noticed is that Track 5- Way Out Of Here  could be right off of a PERFECT CIRCLE Cd. It's way too similar if you ask me. I still like it though. I can't wait to hear some of these tunes live but I'm hoping for a good mix of older stuff too. Deadwing is going to be hard to beat for me.

They are pawns in an ongoing stellar war and in the attempts of the bureaucracy to maintain power over all humans. <br /> <br />John manages to hack off just about everyone when he manages to keep his colony from being wiped out. He saves his people and then embarks upon a grand scheme to see that such things cannot happen again. It is very surprising. <br /> <br />It is entertaining and very quick to read. I wish there would be more. <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This has to be my favorite musical of all time. The way they blend different songs into the dialogue of the film is simply amazing, tying song to story in a way that creates a flowing and creative story. Kidman and McGregor's work on this is amazing, creating characters that you really care about and want to know.<br /><br />An insane barage of images, song, music, lights...this film will leave you breathless and wanting more.
B00005K3O4|5.0|From the far reaches of space they came, seeking an unwary populace to devour and destroy! With their tiny car, floppy shoes, and bone-white faces, they crept into town one dark night. The KILLER KLOWNS had arrived, just in time for dinner! Yep, this amazing little low-budget movie is a must see / must own classic! Whether you love clowns or hate them, KKFOS belongs in every dvd collection! We get cotton candy cadaver coccoons, alien clown-larva popcorn pop-guns, and flesh-dissolving pies! We even get a boxing glove decapitation scene for added enjoyment! John Vernon (Animal House's Dean Wormer himself!) and Royal Dano (Messiah Of Evil) add their comedic talents to this hellish carnival of hilarity! Guaranteed 100% ridiculous and F-U-N! Buy immediately! P.S.- The \\"Clownzilla\\" sequence is my personal favorite. Very well done!...
B000HBK3MM|5.0|It's rare when an album gives me chills, but Ms. Rae's voice sends them down my spine with her soulful songs.  Her songs are bright and emotional.  She is one of the best r&b artists to emerge and I'm grateful that she gets to share her gift with the world.
B000O178BY|5.0|Not surprisingly t-rez comes up wit another great sounding album.  <br />I swear the only way to listen to this is LOUD very very LOUD! <br />its very noisy but great at the same time <br />cant wait for pt.2 but i think its going to be a movie, who knows.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I could not even listen to any of the songs completely.. they were just painful. Very dissapointed.. loved her last 2 albums..this one is very bad..
B000002AHM|5.0|Everytime I listen to this CD I come away with something new. I've been listening to this since the 80's and every time I get goosebumps. Three geniuses come together on a magical night and create this something that happens once in a lifetime. I've always thought it would be a great if the three could collaborate and write a book on their inspirations for doing this, how much did they *really* practice and such. It would an incredible read. Today my kids (8 and 10) were listening to this on my iPOD and were blown away!!!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|As good as an artist that Norah Jones is, one thing I couldn't understand is why she appeared to keep dropping off the face of the Earth after releasing two singles. At any rate, she came back with Not Too Late, and if you're already a fan of hers, this album definitely won't change your mind.<br /><br />I noticed that a few of the songs have more accessible themes than her previous albums; maybe Norah wanted to keep people from thinking that all her songs blend into each other. \\"My Dear Country\\" is an interesting take on the otherwise played-out political theme, while \\"Wish I Could\\" and \\"Wake Up\\" are nice acoustic tracks. And while \\"Not My Friend\\" doesn't look like much on paper, it proves to be a highlight after all once you hear it sung.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to find a funky song like \\"Be My Somebody\\" on a Norah Jones album, but it works very well. But there are also standard mellow songs that impress, like \\"Little Room\\", \\"Thinking About You\\" and the title track.. In fact, the only reason I knocked off half a star is because the horn section during the break of \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" sound a little odd. Aside from that tiny misstep, Norah proves that indeed it's not too late to add another album to her list of masterpieces.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000002KHH|5.0|I, for one, tend to feel that Black Sabbath's debut is rather underappreciated, but there's no denying that \\"Paranoid\\" is the album that really got thing going, both for Black Sabbath and for metal in general.  Probably the most impressive thing about \\"Paranoid\\" is just how well it holds up.  Lotsa historically significant albums like this don't hold up that well after thirty+ years, being surpassed by bigger and better things.  Now, \\"Paranoid\\" isn't the greatest metal album of all time, but it's still up there, and that ain't a little thing, since it's pretty much the second metal album ever.  (I enjoy Zep, but they don't sound like metal to me, and they ain't as good as Sab anyway.)<br /><br />The debut was a metal album, for sure, but Black Sabbath really begins to fully define the sound with this album, cutting down on the blues-rock elements and going for more straight up, pounding, metal riffs.  Iommi has never sounded better than he does here, though the rhythm section is still the secret weapon of the band, as Butler and Ward allow for a bit more groove than lotsa later rhythm sections.  Ozzy's not much of a singer from a technical standpoint, but he suits the sound well, and his flat, eerie delivery forces us to take the  sometimes silly lyrics more seriously than they have any right to be taken.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" is wall to wall classics, all laying the base for what would come.  \\"War Pigs\\" is a big classic rock radio song now, and not w/o reason.  It's one of the most flatly ominous things they've ever done, where Ozzy's limited vox are used to their best possible effect, and Iommi tosses out some of his best, most bruising riffs.  The title track is a driving, energetic number presaging both punk and speed metal, and it's followed by the gentle, underappreciated \\"Planet Caravan\\".  It's a good thing Sabbath didn't make too many songs like this one, but it's an interesting change of pace for one track.  Then we come to \\"Iron Man\\", perhaps the definitive metal song, even after all these years.  It rules, no doubt.<br /><br />The second half of \\"Paranoid\\" isn't as well remembered as the first, but it presents no substantiative drop in quality.  \\"Hand of Doom\\" and \\"Electric Funeral\\" are two fine, slow moving pieces with tons of atmosphere, both pointing towards the doom metal movement.  We close with the dual closers \\"Rat Salad\\" and \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\", both of which kick up the energy level a bit, with brisk, cracking snare fills and some of Ozzie's best, funnest vocals in the latter.  Not the strongest tracks on the album, but still good and far from filler.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  No need for a review, really.  Any and all metal fans need this album, obviously.  (Actually, you need the Black Box box set, but it comes to the same thing.)efinitive metal song, even after all these years.

B000O178BY|4.0|The track \\"In This Twilight\\" is a real highlight of this album. You absolutely have to check out the video Jennaphoenix made for it on YouTube. It is titled \\"NIN - In This Twilight - music video visuals\\" (Not to be confused with \\"Nine Inch Nails - \\"In This Twilight\\" Movie Music Video\\" by Editsbydan, which is similar but not nearly as good in my opinion.) Jennaphoenix's collage of images of various apocalyptic movies is quite powerful and fits the song perfectly.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth (in HD) is simply mind-blowing. The narration by Sir David is exactly what the series called for. Those who heard Sigourney Weaver's very good narration on Discovery will notice the difference, and I don't think they will be disappointed (except perhaps to some American audiences who might be slightly confused by the occasional use of metric measurements, and a comparison to something as being \\"the size of Wales\\"). The music is similarly first rate - a magnificent, subtle score that does full justice to some of the most fantastic shots this planet can provide without being overly distracting. The sequence over the Angel Falls (Fresh Water) was worth the entire set.  <br /> <br />Note to those with Xbox 360 HD-DVD players - the Xbox needs to be updated before it can play the HD-DVD. After the disk has been put it, connecting to Xbox Live will lead to a prompt for an update download; download it and restart. Without this download, the HD-DVD will not play.
044656740X|4.0|I've studied numerous books on personal money management and wealth creation, but I must say Kiyosaki's is one of the better ones. Most finance books are pure finance and potential suggestions. They miss what precludes any great change in your life, and where most fail at; stepping back from your life as an employee and creating the proper mindset to get rich, (or achieve whatever financial goals you have). Inotherwords, if you're head isn't in the right place from the beginning, the discipline and tools will not be enough to get you there. He feels that the single most important quality to achieve success is in the philosophy. How the wealthy think is what makes them different from the average worker or those just getting by.     People who grind it out for the man day in day out need a complete brain makeover before they can see the forest for the trees. Kiyosaki had two father figures, a poor one (his real dad) and a rich one. His poor dad offer this worldview to his son; \\"Study hard so you can find a good company to work for.\\" For him, talk of money was bad. Risk was bad. He argued that one's company is responsible to make sure all his needs were met. Finding the best job with the best company that offered the best benefits, to him, was best. His rich dad, on the other hand, encouraged talking about money around the dinner table, to teach the children how to think. He encouraged managing risk, rather than avoiding it. He argued against reliance upon an employer and for \\"total financial self-reliance\\" (16). Of course, Kiyosaki's book promotes the mindset of his rich dad.     The book breaks down into six main lessons, which help the reader understand the mindset rather than a method. To close, Kiyosaki makes suggestions about how to begin. First, he combats the five main reasons people stay in their current life-style: fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits, and arrogance. He then gives ten steps to begin this new mindset.     Great book for its simplicity, original approach and value.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Hey ppl! <br />I saw someone here Blaming Avril, saying it Profane blábláblá. <br />Hey... <br />There's a \\"Parental Advisory\\" tag there saying \\"Explicit content\\". <br />If you'll buy it to your kids, PAY ATENTION to it.... it DOES MEAN something... <br />There's another version to this album, that's all edited with no bad words and stuf... It's no worth in buying something you don't even know what is and than going around to blame someone... <br />This is an amazing album. It's fun and SO confident. <br />I have the TWO versions, the Explicit and the Clean album. <br />Its GREAT.

032147404X|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is starting digital photography. It is very well written, easy to read and full of insightful tips. It gets you started immediately with the practical stuff without bogging you down with technical details. The beauty is as you try out the stuff the author talks about, you start catching on to the theory anyway. I have owned this book for 6 months, ready many of it's chapters 6-7 times, and always end up finding something new hidden in the simple do-it-yourself suggestions. <br /> <br />An excellent follow-up to this book is \\"Understanding Exposure\\" by Bryan Peterson, which describes more of the theory/technical stuff behind capturing an image but is also full of excellent illustrations and very useful tips.
0441172717|5.0|\\"Dune, Arrakis, desert planet.\\"  A phrase used more than once in Frank Herbert`s legendary first glimpse into his future-looking mythos.  The phrase can be viewed as a microcosm for descriptions of nearly every character, place, custom, and internal monologue in \\"Dune\\".  No character is single-dimensional, no location is used as backdrop only, and no discourse represents one interpretation.<br /><br />*introductory plot information below*<br /><br />The universe of Dune is set in an almost impossibly distant future, some 20,000 years from now, and is a time when guided human perfection is used as replacement for machines, when amorphous political entities hold galaxy-changing power, and when one man and one planet hold the destiny of the universe under their linked influences.  Paul Atreides is a young nobleman, son of Duke Leto Atreides, head of the House Atreides, a major galactic power.  We are introduced to Paul just prior to his testing by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, a matriarch of the Bene Gesserit.  The test's purpose is to determine whether or not Paul is \\"human\\" by determining his capacity to ignore pain for a higher purpose:  preservation of his life.  Paul triumphs in this test, administered by a pain amplifier known as a gom jobbar--but the test's true purpose, to determine whether or not he is the long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach, the male Bene Gesserit, is at yet hidden from him.  The Bene Gesserit, via selective breeding programs spanning centuries into the past, have long labored to combine just the right genes to produce a prescient male, capable of seeing past, present, and future simultaneously.  Paul's destiny, or \\"terrible purpose\\" as the character himself interprets it, is intractably linked with that of the galaxy.<br /><br />*some tiny spoilers below*<br /><br />Frank Herbert's masterpiece succeeds on so many levels because it is many things to many different people.  For those who prefer intellectual prose and erudite dialogue, please refer to the many interweaving schemes which bind the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to the Emperor Shaddam IV, the doctor Yueh to the Duke Leto, and the lore of the Missionaria Protectiva to the destiny of Paul Muad'dib.  For the more viscerally-inclined, you need only turn to Frank's stunning depictions of the duels between knife-masters, where each move and countermove is discussed without the reader becoming separated from the true desperation manifested in these struggles.  Perhaps your tastes meander towards treatises discussing environmental concerns?  Look no further then the activities of the \\"Imperial planetologist\\" of Dune, Liet-Kynes, who has crafted himself into an almost godlike figure, worthy of absolute devotion by the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen.  Through the teachings and guidance of Liet, an Imperial representative who has \\"gone native\\", the Fremen use ecological principles to...  Well, you will have to read the book to find out.  Are you a devotee of cryptozoology, that pseudoscience which infects the brain with enticing possibilities regarding monsters living amongst us?  Consider the sand-worm of Arrakis, a monster of such stunning size that dimensions of hundreds of meters are yet insufficient to truly describe the sheer immensity of the largest specimens.  The internal monologues, brief historical quotations prefacing each chapter, and \\"thrust-parry\\" dialogues provide a rich backdrop of philosophy and psychology for the thinking reader to gnaw on.  Last, any fan of mysticism, the mystery of consciousness, or the question of limits of the human mind will enjoy reading about the \\"weapons from the past\\" that a tested Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit has at her disposal.<br /><br />Any discussion of \\"Dune\\" will likely lack true objectivity, and I confess that I, too, do not have an impartial viewpoint.  In my time, I have read \\"Dune\\" perhaps four times, and have listened to George Guidall's momentous audiobook reading at least ten times.  Past the desire to inspire another person to read this book with semi-adept word-combination assembly, let me say that Frank's writing allows me to actually taste spice-coffee, witness Duncan's drunken ramblings, and hear Piter's death throes.  Herbert is simply an author unparalleled at weaving the reader's perceptions with the experiences depicted in his masterpiece.  Five stars for content, depth, suspension of disbelief, total reader-world immersion, and sublime writing.  George Guidall's performance tacks an extra half-star to the audiobook version.<br /><br />Science fiction fans:  Never too late to read Frank's masterpiece.  Continue up to \\"Chapterhouse:  Dune\\" should you possess deep wells of patience, but PLEASE stop there (\\"Hunter's of Dune\\" is a travesty).<br /><br />Non-science fiction fans:  As I said, this book appeals on many levels.

B000ENWKN8|4.0|I'll agree with other that this album is Rob's least heavy album. That being said, I found it very enjoyable. The songs are easily accesible and probably the most mainstream sounding Zombie has ever put out. This album is sure to cater to a much wider scope of people then say, Hellbilly Deluxe. The beats and hooks are very catchy. It's defintely not his best effort but still a worthy album that shows how Rob is always progressing and never beating a certain sound to death. A+ to Rob Zombie for his innovation in music from the early White Zombie days to present.
B000002UAR|5.0|To call the Beatles' 1966 album \\"Revolver\\" a masterpiece is nothing new. But the album is what it is---a masterpiece. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison & Ringo Starr demonstrated with this release the genius pop/rock that can come from the marriage of memorable songwriting, skillful performance, AND outstanding studio experimentation. You can hear the Fab Four continue to evolve on these world-class tunes. All the Beatles shine on this one: Lennon's whimsical \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" the jangly rockers \\"She Said She Said,\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" \\"Doctor Robert,\\" and the outstanding, far-out-man, psychedelic trip of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (a truly groundbreaking track that foreshadows where the band would go next). McCartney contributes the haunting \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (augmented by an equally haunting string section), the lovely ballads \\"Here There & Everywhere\\" and \\"For No One,\\" the memorable sing-along kids tune \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" the upbeat \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" and the R&B winner \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" (capped off by a great brass section). Harrison gets a rare trio of tunes instead of the usual pair, and they're all top stuff too: the dirty guitar-rocker \\"Taxman,\\" the sitar-driven \\"Love You To\\" (George's first foray into Middle-Eastern musical territory), and the fun \\"I Want To Tell You.\\" Meanwhile, Ringo gets a classic lead vocal on \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" and delivers what is arguably his single finest moment on the drums on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" smashing his kit with everything he's got. I love the band's studio wizardry on display here too, including the various tape loop effects on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" and the \\"nautical\\" sound & vocal effects on \\"Yellow Submarine.\\" \\"Revolver,\\" of course, paved the way for \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" and many consider \\"Revolver\\" to be the Beatles' \\"practice run\\" for \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" as they were just starting to explore the musical possibilities that would become fully flowered on \\"Pepper,\\" but \\"Revolver\\" is a landmark work all on it's own. It's a Beatles masterpiece, but you knew that already.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Several stories about love are woven together to create a very enjoyable film.  Dry, witty British humor is showcased by an amazing cast: Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and many others.  Although very funny, American audiences may gasp at this film because of the cultural differences in England.  There is quite a bit of nudity, adult situations and language that may be considered offensive.
B0000JCFPE|5.0|An excellent film that has in effect become a classic, Basic Instinct, brings to the screen a murder mystery involving a police detective and a sensual multi-millionaire writer.   <br />The setting is San Francisco and detective Curran is investigating the gruesome murder of a man found dead in his bed after what seems to have been a passionate and steamy night.  The investigation reveals a purely sexual relationship between the deceased and a striking novelist whose life seems to be intertwined with various deadly accidents and mysterious deaths.  Things become rather complicated when her latest novel's hero oddly resembles detective Curran...  <br />Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), Mitch Pileggi (X-Files), George Dzundza, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!  <br />The film combines a great cast, a great mystery, and some very realistic and very erotic sex scenes (for a change). <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music (!) are all wonderful! <br />In short, Basic Instinct is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! <br />
B000O75F7C|5.0|Should reincarnation be proven then we'd look no further than Steven Wilson to see what past genius now inhabits his body. Mozart might be a close comparison given Wilson's biography that proclaims him a musical prodigy. And as would befit a man of his talent he has sought and found musicians who are at least his equals. The whole of Porcupine Tree is an unrelenting musical elemental, capable of creating any sound, from the trivial to the ferociously complex, and harnessing them into songs that sound in every moment as beautiful as the sight of spun glass.<br /><br />\\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\", PT's 11th, only solidifies their mastery, and any listener should know that the same exacting quality of music is apparent from the first album, and magnified since PT's fourth recording, \\"Signify\\". Every track on the new album is solid, from the suddenly furious interludes of speed metal to their signature melodies, and is superbly produced, bringing forth with razor sharpness their physiologically defying musicianship and Wilson's evocative vocals and lyrics.<br /><br />There are only comparisons to past classical artists when it's time to define Porcupine Tree and their prodigious and masterful catalog. When you listen to Porcupine Tree you listen to a great musical phenomenon, and they are here, alive, and among us now.
0743529790|5.0|I listened to the audio version, read by the author.<br /><br />The book opens with the depiction of a grisly rape, which is then described about a bajillion more times throughout the book, as Alice reports it to the police and her parents. And then again to the police when a suspect is arrested. And then again in the preliminary hearing and before the grand jury. And during the trial.<br /><br />I disagree with some earlier reviewers. It doesn't get old. I don't know what it would be like to read the words, but hearing her speak them on the audio CD is rather lyrical. She did have to tell the story dozens of times. I found even the repetition of exact phrasing to be compelling. Especially during the trial when the defense attorney repeats every one of her answers back to her as though she's lying. (\\"How far away would you say he was?\\" \\"A hundred yards, 150 at most.\\" \\"A hundred yards? One hundred fifty at most??\\")<br /><br />Even though nothing like this ever happened to me, I related to her. I imagined that if I were to go through something like that, I would handle it as she had: \\"The best rape witness ever seen on the stand.\\"

0671449028|5.0|You cannot go wrong with a Sandra Boynton book. Her clever rhymes are a pleasurable read-aloud, and the length is perfect for even the shortest attention span. This is one of our favorites!
1594200823|5.0|I have to say, this is one fantastic book.  Amazing.   One of those rare books that forces your eyes wide open to an issue that you'd only dimly been aware of.  It's one of those books everyone in the country should read, one that should be of cataclysmic proportions and Change Everything.     <br /> <br />I won't destroy the effect of the book by trying to re-state the information in the book and doing a bad job.  Let's just say that everyone who eats food should read it. <br /> <br />As a rationalist, I've always been sympathetic to the \\"Organic foods\\" movement but uncomfortable with all the pseudo-mystical thinking that's often associated with it.  It made sense to me in principle that growing food the way evolution intended made sense, but I found the arguments I often encountered to often be mostly feel-good, unspecific talk about Cycles of Nature and Gaia and Earth Mother and so on.  They weren't fact-y enough for me.  This book definitely is.  It doesn't have one pseudoscientific vibe to it.  Conservatives can read it just as comfortably as the most crunchy-granola hippie. <br /> <br />Pollan should have won a Pulitzer Prize for this book.  It's magnificently researched and written.  It has plenty of hard fact, but instead of being boring, his clear, simple writing brings them to life and gives them meaning.  He makes his cases carefully, using evidence and fact, and gradually builds to conclusions that I'm forced to admit are inescapable.  It's one of those few fantastic books that takes a subject that's usually dull and dry and makes it not just interesting but, at least for me, *gripping*.  It not only educated me about a whole hell of a lot of things I didn't know, but it walked me though, step by logical step, the reasons why the way our current food production system is seriously broken and horrible for us the consumers, for the farmers, for the plants and animals involved, and for the planet.  I had heard this time and time again from various people, but I always took it with a big grain of salt because the people saying these things also often said ridiculous things about other topics, and I thought their virulence might be largely fed by generic anti-capitalist bias. <br /> <br />While I was never exactly an opponent of natural foods or a fan of factory farming, my feelings were nonspecific because I hadn't really looked into it very much, and I had a real skepticism of all the wild accusations made by the more radical people in some movements.  But now, I'm convinced.  Michael Pollan has presented me with actual objective facts, presented clearly and logically, in an unbiased way, and convinced me through the sheer power of his reasoning.  My mind wasn't changed 180 degrees, but it was definitely changed 90 degrees.  In some cases the logic is so clear it had me practically slapping my forehead in shock at how stupid people can be.  It's been quite a long time since I've been so captivated by the crystal clear beauty of the elegant logic in a perfectly crafted argument. <br /> <br />One thing I like best is that Pollan is largely unbiased himself.  Yes, the book does come to conclusions that are very much against some practices and for very much for others, but he makes the arguments so clear and strong that you can only end up agreeing with him.  He doesn't, for example, come out with a glowing, uncritical, credulous affirmation of  \\"organic\\" food, as I had expected.  While generally positive, he acknowledges serious problems with the system. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book any more strongly.  If it's completely ignored by government and industry - and I'm sure it will be - it's a crime.  This may be the most important book in decades. <br />
B00000J7SS|4.0|I had heard of this recording for a long time but I obtained it only recently.  I rescued my copy from destruction.  The local library (under pressure from the politicians) is purging their collection of music that contain what they call the \\"B\\" word. <br /> <br />I know that there is currently dispute about the use of \\"the B word\\" in song lyrics.  But there are ABSOLUTELY NO LYRICS in or on this album so I hardly see how the prohibition has any relevance.  I do not see how anyone who is not mentally ill could be offended in any way. <br /> <br />I pointed out that there were still albums on the shelf by white artists that contained the word.  They said the problem with B******s Brew was the combination of the word with what they called a \\"partially nude black woman\\" on the cover, which was a violation of their new policy. I do see this on the cover, so I must not have the same type of imagination. <br /> <br />There are plenty of albums with partially clad women still on the shelves, so obviously the policy violation happens because of the color of the woman's skin.  I offered to redo the cover art in photoshop to lighten the lady's skin, so they could continue to make this interesting music available to the public.  They did not think that was even slightly funny. <br /> <br />Word is that the record company is in the process of re-issuing this with additional tracks under the title \\"Miles' Brew\\".  I suggest they keep the title, and replace the cover with beautiful collie dog, puppies, and a beer. <br /> <br /> <br />Finally, what about the music?  I think it is very interesting, but far from the best thing that Miles has done.  It is an important album in the history of jazz, and I hope it can remain available in it's original form, with the beautiful cover art intact. <br /> <br />
0714843377|1.0|I bought this book expecting to learn something. Instead, its a random collection of thoughts which just about anyone who had been in business for a few years could write.<br /><br />Most distressing to me of all is most of the book is about how to be successful in advertising and this is not stated on the cover or back.  The book didn't really inspire me, and the content seemed pretty disconnected from the actual content itself.<br /><br />Not recommended to buy at all.
B000O178BY|5.0|This is Trent's best album, ever, period.  I was a huge NIN fan in the beginning as an old school rivet head into Ministry and Skinny Puppy.  NIN was a private discovery.  Then I watched in dismay as they exploded and became HUGE.  Industrial had finally gone mainstream.  My interest started to wane with the Fragile -- good stuff, but same-samey.  With Teeth is good, but doesn't get much CD player time from me for some reason. But Year Zero, THIS, this is PERFECT!!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Gearing up for part three, I decided to watch the original.  This is an absolute joy to watch even after so much time has past.  Great story for both young and old.  Mike Myers is a comedic genius, Eddie Murphy is just hilarious and Lithgow is a priceless gem.  This is honestly one of those movies you never get tired of watching.  Highly Highly Recommended.
B00000AOUD|3.0|I cannot believe the way some people go on about this LP ... geez ... here's the reality if it.  There's some good material here, enough for 4 or 5 good songs.  It's mostly on Side 1.  Side 2 is like some weird \\"remix\\" of similar themes that is fairly unnecessary.  The whole weaving of the songs together and pretense towards viewing this as a \\"concept album\\" or some merging of pop and classic forms is unnecessary and serves the material badly.  So do a few of the arrangements with bouncing pipe organ and so forth that will make most non-fans wince and remind many of us of Spinal Tap's \\"Stonehenge\\" (the penultimate Tull parody) and so forth.  And the muddy recording quality does this material no favors either.    That's not to say this is a disaster, because Anderson was still writing good stuff, with energy and imagination.  I think we would have all been better served if the tracks were broken out seperately and the pretense removed - if this could have been halfway-a-concept-album, songs that relate instead of interlink, like \\"Aqualung\\".      They overreached, and the results are mildly interesting.
0131479415|5.0|Agile Estimating and Planning was just the book we needed.  We'd read many books on the topic of lean development but most of those books give you the principles but say very little about actual application.  They typically leave it at \\"see what works for you\\".  Mike Cohn's book deals with how to make those very hard decisions when you first start.  What is the norm and what works well.  Not only did it provide those guidlines for those decisions it explained the why's behind it.  For a non-agile project to transition into agile it is often difficult to hiccup at the beginning specially when skeptics are lerking around to point out things that are not working well.  Although iterative improvment is still the name of the game it doesn't hurt to have your first 2 iterations come out as a success which is what happened to us.  With Mike's help we were able to make some good decisions from the start that were winners with confidence and ease.  We will continue to refine them but having a good base to work from was very helpful. <br /> <br />The book literally goes through how to make key decisions for the most difficult challenges you are faced with when starting an agile project.  We couldn't have done it without this book.  I highly recommend it and I've ordered several copies for my project managers and team leads. <br /> <br />Saviz Artang
B000002WPI|5.0|Incorporating diciplined martial arts tactics including the group's name, Wu-Tang Clan, pierced through the industry with their debut album Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).  \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\" introduces the album and the clan with a slow, dark instrumentation with hints of ancient effects.  Unselfishly sharing verses, four of the eight members slash through the track with lyrical wisardry.  Picking up the pace on \\"Shame On A Nigga\\" is a direct blow with combining off keyed production with perfection.  The Genius also known as The Gza stepped center stage on \\"Clan In Da Front\\" as the remaining members chant \\"...Wu, Wu, Wu...\\" bringing the clan to the forefront.  Providing lyrical arsenal without any need for gimmicks, hook or chorus, \\"Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber\\" -Part I and II as six of the members flow back to back in unison and individualism with contents such as \\"...rap assassin / fastin'...\\"  The same formula could be found on \\"Protect Ya Neck\\" with only a bridge to gap the diversity.  \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\" mostly dedicated to the streets by Raekwon and Ghost Face Killer flows with finess over the looped overpowering guitar strum.  The one, two kick drum accompanied by an Oriental themed keys on \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\\" contributed to the LP's concept with Wu-Tang's signature sound.  Continuing with \\"Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit\\" they proved how tightly knit the group is going in any direction or angle.  The title \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\" soon made it to be a household slang for cash rules everything around me or better yet \\"...dollar, dollar bill y'all...\\"  Member and title \\"Method Man\\" enlighten the dim surroundings with simple keys to compliment the rhaspy, energetic flow.  Completing a 360 angle, \\"Tearz\\" contains tales of street life and decisions one make told by The Rza and Ghost Face Killer respectively.  All production and arrangement was held down by member Prince Rakeem also known as The Rza that tailored the style and signature of the group to perfection.  For its time and to date no other group with this many members come togher to create a timeless piece or classic the closest would be the earlier Three 6 Mafia material.  The Rza, The Gza, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspector Deck, Raekwon The Chief, U-God, Ghost Face Killer and Method Man strikes as if it is retaliation, but their nitche was loosely guarded as they made an entrance.For its time and to date no other group with this many members come togher to create a timeless piece or classic the closest would be the earlier Three 6 Mafia material.

075640407X|5.0|While I love fantasy and science-fiction, I am very hard to please.  I spend hours looking through books looking for something that hooks me and when I find an author I like I try and read everything they've written.  Patrick Rothfuss is now on my must-read list.   <br /> <br />I picked it up because Tad Williams' sang its praise and after reading the book I cam here to Amazon and found Robin Hobb's positive comments.  If you love their books as I do, you'll be happy to know they are sincere.  The book is worthy of their praise. <br />
B00005JPP6|4.0|Sergeant Nicholas Angel is good.  Too good.  An expert in virtually every aspect of police work, Mr. Angel is an example of the kind of supercop that Bruckheimer & Friends make fireball-fueled and car-chase-crazy movies about every day of the week.  [[ASIN:B0000DKDUR Bad Boys II]] and [[ASIN:B000GUJZ4G Point Break]], for example.<br /><br />These kinds of flicks provide the grist for Edgar Wright's \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" a movie that takes almost every buddy cop cliche in the book and adds the same dose of wry humor and half-glimpsed sight gags that made [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]] an equally delicious satire of horror films.<br /><br />\\"Fuzz\\" has some of the same faces as \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  Simon Pegg returns as Angel, a man whose jealous London peers (including acting heavyweights Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan) send him packing to the quaint cottage community of Sandford, a village so tweedy and polite that a man's missing swan is big news.  You half expect Sgt. Angel to turn the corner and see locals crafting homemade ranch dressing.<br /><br />Of course, things aren't exactly as they seem, and that goes double for the town's stellar lack of crime.  Angel, who is incapable of \\"turning off\\" his brain, joins his partner, the stumbly, bumbly, chummily Danny Butterman (Nick Frost playing, yet again, a man whose brain hardly ever seems to be on) as they work to unravel the mystery behind the town's cobbled, rustic veneer.<br /><br />It takes awhile, but that's only because \\"Hot Fuzz\\" doesn't want to leave any cliche unused.  Things get a little ludicrous, but, in spite of its frenetic music video editing and vicious murder scenes, this movie is all about ludicrousness.  The twists and turns are part and parcel for this kind of happy homage, which even gives a nod to [[ASIN:B00006HBUA Scooby-Doo]].  Listen carefully and you'll hear a line that's too close to \\"I would've gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids\\" to be an accident.<br /><br />Watch carefully, too.  Wright and Penn have stacked jokes upon jokes, which is a good thing, since the movie appears to have about five different endings, each one more outrageous than the first.  Although things drag a bit near the end, it's the subtle background winks (a set of twins you don't know are twins until the end), the script's subtle finesse (listen and watch for someone named Aaron), and the super-duper subtle cameos (Cate Blanchett who you probably won't recognize, and an uncredited Peter Jackson as a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Santa Claus killer) that really make this flick work, in spite of its sometimes-ridiculous excesses.<br /><br />Anyway, the kinds of films \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is riffing off of aren't known for much more than their ridiculous excesses.  And although subtlety is an odd thing to look for in a film that is all about men with guns jumping sideways through the air, you don't need to worry.  There's still plenty of in-your-face action to light up the screen, including a very graphic head crushing, a critical car chase (there's that swan again!), and even a few great, big, chubby fireballs.<br /><br />Bruckheimer would be proud.an accident. <br /> <br />Watch carefully, too.

0553212737|4.0|A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.<br /><br />She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.<br /><br />I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!
B000IY041S|5.0|Rammstein is one of those bands that sounds and looks amazing live. I had the chance to see them on their Mutter tour a few years ago, and it was the best show I've ever gone to. <br /> <br />The DVD highlights some of their energy on stage. I reccomend it to anyone who is a Rammstein fan, it's just fun to watch, these guys put on a great and entertaining show.
B000002H97|3.0|To this date, this is probably Metallica's weakest album.  If it's not the entire commercial sound of the album that rubs me the wrong way, it's all the unnecessary plodding tunes such as \\"nothing else matters\\" or the fake-sounding opening number \\"enter sandman\\" (check out \\"battery\\" for a REAL good way to start an album) that drags the music down.  To sum up my feelings- the album just feels too much like an intended way to make a commercial album, and not caring about the quality of the songwriting. <br /> <br />Well, it has its moments, but it's mainly the vocals that save this album.  The guitar playing is unfortunately very bland and uninteresting, in my opinion.
B000O75F7C|5.0|After being mildly disappointed with Deadwing, I had reservation about Porcupine Tree's latest album. However, after initial listen I am pleased to report that PT have finally managed to find the perfect balance between their older atmospheric prog and their newer, heavier traits.  <br /> <br />Steven Wilson is in fine form on this album, musically it is astonishing. A swirling vortex of guitars, masterful drums courtesy of Mr. Harrison, dreamy soundscapes and lush synths combine to create the familiar PT sound, but this time around there is absolutely no filler, and the entire album remains focused and cohesive from start to finish.  <br />  <br />The only room for improvement is the lyrics, which aren't bad by any means but for some reason they don't grab me quite as much as past albums have. The concept is original and unique, and a little more easily understood than the sometimes opaque themes of previous records.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of older Porcupine Tree you will be pleased to know that this album is a little less song-oriented and a little more atmospheric and free-form than the last two. If you're a newer Porcupine Tree fan you'll be please to know that this albums add more heaviness and grind, but finds a zen-like balance between the two. Instead of heavier sections tacked onto lighter songs,Fear of a Blank Planet morphs from raging beast to soothing angel completely effortlessly and seamlessly.  <br /> <br />I can't wait to see where this band goes next.
B000003TA4|5.0|Please keep in mind that, even though I was a teenager when this album came out (or about to become one, rather) I never got into grunge at all.  Even as my friends were playing the albums, I just found the music to be an attempt to rock out, only to normally have weak songwriting and nothing memorable about the music to really help me understand why the genre became so popular.  All the bands sounded the same to me.   <br /> <br />However, Nevermind was really different from all the other ones.  It was angrier, and the lyrics were backed up with simple and interesting musical ideas.  Sure, all the songs on Nevermind sound almost identical to each other, with only minor changes in tempo and slight variations on the way the songs are written.  BUT, I happen to like this idea.   <br /> <br />I went five whole years without listening to this album, so the other day, in April of 2007, when I finally took it off the shelf and popped it into the CD player (well, DVD player) I was really surprised that the songwriting has really stood the test of time.  The songs that were enjoyable 15 years ago are still enjoyable today. <br /> <br />Sure, you could argue that many of the songs have been played WAY too much through the years and are probably worn out, but to me, these songs are still fresh and exciting.  You will recognize every song.  It's not like you can forget them- they're all really catchy.  Very good songwriting overall. <br /> <br />I still love the \\"yeah yeah\\" section of \\"lithium\\" and \\"something in the way\\" is such a scary way to close out an album.  Scary because it ends on such an unusual note.  \\"smells like teen spirit\\" remains a classic, as does the rest of the album.  This album should be in every rock or grunge fans collection.

0887307280|5.0|This is a great book.  The harsh critic below has a MAJOR conflict of interest, ADMITS HE DIDN'T READ THE BOOK - and he it full of BS to boot! <br /> <br />I think it must be sour grapes for this critic: he owns a small book publishing company nobody has ever heard of and has written and published his own books on (get this): how to be a successful entrepreneur and how to be a successful investor! Neither book is a best seller; indeed, I've never heard of either and I buy and read a LOT of business and investment books. It would be nice if the critic would give some hard figures on WHY his opinion on how to build a successful business or be a successful investor should be given any weight. <br /> <br />There is a saying that \\"Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, critique.\\" I strongly suspect it is more than a little appropriate here. <br /> <br />I HAVE built two small businesses from scratch and made millions from each. I am still running one, 10 years old, with annual sales approaching $5M and a ROE usually over 50%. Oh, yeah, and I only show up once every few weeks, on average. <br /> <br />It didn't used to be that way - my businesses used to drive me crazy and struggle to break even. But I DID read \\"The E Myth\\" and it taught me what all my M.B.A. classes didn't: how to make a business run like a top instead of merely like a bad job. <br /> <br />Anyway, I don't know enough about the critic to say he hasn't anything at all useful to teach. I DO know, though, that he is is a publisher who apparently can't recognize a highly meritorious best seller when he sees one!  Presumably he would have declined to publish \\"The E Myth\\"?

Instead, each strength is explained in a vacum. <br /> <br />The concept of focusing on what people do well is great.  Once you learn to do this as a manager its very liberating.  You start to think about how you build a team that compliments each other.  As an individual its liberating to realize everyone has things they can do better.  You can stop beating yourself up.  Now if your manager would only stop doing that!
B00005JPAO|5.0|At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities.  It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.<br /><br />THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage.  But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office.  She has authority, wealth, and priviledge of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand.  At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.<br /><br />It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life.  Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life.  This proves a great miscalculation.  The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.<br /><br />Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said.  It is brilliant and quite possibly unequalled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure.  It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively.  The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.<br /><br />The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan.  In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious.  I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness.  This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film.  At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment.  The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it.  In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling.  Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, \\"making of\\" documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still.

B000093BDX|5.0|Too many mono songs?  Another redundant collection?  Hmmmm.  I guess I don't care.<br /><br />I just wanted to freshen up my hodpodge of vinyl and audio cassettes with a good comprehensive single source on CD.  I made a list of MUST HAVE Beach Boys tunes.  And . . . I found that this was the ONLY compilation that had every one on my list (except Spirit of America).  And on a single disc (convenient) carrying 30 songs. All of their most popular hits and even a couple of great covers (I love \\"Come Go With Me).<br /><br />I think the audio quality is fine and some of the remastering work gives a fresh listening experience to familiar tunes. (Heck, I first fell in love with most of these songs listening to them on a transistor radio with a single 3\\" paper cone speaker).  The liner notes are also nicely done . . . some photos, band history, and a little data summary on each tune.  Informative and interesting.  This is an outstanding anthology of Beach Boys best and can be had at a very reasonable price.

B000LXH0AY|5.0|I have never had much patience for musical productions but that all changed after watching Rent... and what an awesome collection of songs!  Not usually one for repeat performances, I've watched it many times.  For me, it's a truly passionate experience.    The supplementary disk includes biographical information on Jonathon Larson, the creator of this wonderful play, which alone is worth the price of the two-disk collection.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|I bought Machine Head's brand new album \\"The Blackening\\" over the weekend, and let me just say this right off the bat, that words can't even describe how much I love this album. Eight solid tracks, over sixty minutes of pure epic metal, \\"The Blackening\\" is without question Machine Head's most epic, powerful, and best release to date thus far, and it's already one of the best metal albums of 2007 thus far as well. When I first listened to this album (and I'am still currently listening to this), I was completely blown away. I mean every song on here is a classic, the songwriting is just incredible, the musicianship is totally phenomenal and out of this world. Frontman Robb Flynn's vocals are just fantastic. His vocals can range from vicious growls and angry screams, to a great clean singing range. Oh yeah did I mention that Robb's an incredible guitarist as well. Together he and lead shredder Phil Demmel deliver tons and tons of great fast heavy riffs, wild scorching dualing solos, and beyond beautiful harmonies throughout this album. Adam Duece's bass lines are just crisp, solid, and hearable. Dave McClain is just an incredible drummer with great speed and precision. This album also showcases some of Dave's best and most powerful drum work on here as well.<br /><br />The Songs:<br /><br />1. Clenching the Fists of Dissent (10:36): The opening track and my favorite song on here. Man words just cannot describe how much I love this song. It starts off with some nice accoustic strings, however at approximately 1:43, a barrage of fast steamrolling riffs followed by fast pounding drums and angry vocals from Robb gets the song and the album rolling without warning. I like the shout of Fight! Fight! Fight! at the 6:33 mark. The dualing solos by Robb and Phil are just awesome. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />2. Beautiful Mourning (4:46): Another great song that starts off with some great fast riffs, which are quickly followed by some fast marching drums. A very brutal intense song. Nice solo by Robb BTW. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />3. Aesthetics of Hate (6:30): One of the most and I do mean one of the most intense in your face songs on the album, and another favorite of mine as well. The lyrics are very angry and very in your face too. Great angry vocals from Robb, great brutal riffs, awesome back to back soloing, and great drumming. I also like during the slow tempo section where Robb says \\"May the Hand of God Strike Them Down\\". A great song to listen to especially when you're having one of those rough days. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />4. Now I Lay Thee Down (5:34): This is one of the more slower songs on here. There's lots of great riffs, and some nice solid bass work from Adam. This song also has it's angry parts too. I really like the part where all the guitar solos and harmonies go back and forth. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />5. Slanderous (5:16): Another heavy, in your face, yet very groovy song that features some great heavy yet groovy riffs and a catchy drum beat throughout. Great waling back to back solos from Robb and Phil BTW. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />6. Halo (9:03): Ahhhh, another epic track, and a another huge highlight which inlcluded so many great different rhythm sections. The choruses just bring tears to my eyes whenever I sing along to them. Robb's vocals are just incredible on this song, as well as the riffs, the solos, and drumming. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />7. Wolves (9:01): This is another very heavy song, and another epic as well. To me this song is another huge highlight because most of this song is just super fast with fast punishing drums, blistering thrashing riffs, and some more wild careening back to back solos that will make your ears bleed blood red. The chorus is very powerful too. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />8. A Farewell to Arms (10:12): The epic album closer, and when I say epic, I do mean epic. It starts off with a slow tempo section just like the opening song, and then approximately at the 6 minute mark, the song breaks in with some angry brutal riffs, and angry vocals from Robb followed by a sick wailing guitar solo from Phil which is soon followed by some punishing drumwork, and more hefty riffs. A fantastic album closer, and another one of my favorites as well. Jeremy's rating: 5/5<br /><br />See every song gets a 5 out of 5<br /><br />Normally, I don't write long reviews, but since this album is soooooo incredible, I thought I'd give it a long well thought out review. Like I said before, \\"The Blackening\\" is the most epic, powerful, and the best album of Machine Head's career to date thus far, and of course being one of the best and I do mean best metal albums of 2007 thus far. After listening to this album so many times, I'am not even afraid to say, that this album has already become one of the my top 25 favorite metal albums of all time now.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you don't have The Blackening, then you are seriously missing out on some true epic heavy metal for the ages. Do yourself a huge favor, go out and buy this masterpiece of an album ASAP. This album proves that true heavy metal is alive and well.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Here it comes, a new album from the most underrated band (but that's about to change I think). A summary for those new to the band: it's a fantastic record, but one that requires a lot of attention; if you want to get familiar with Porcupine Tree, by all means grab Fear of A Blank Planet but also get In Absentia. <br /> <br />First of all, speaking of album roots. I believe the album's direction was first outlined in two instrumental outtakes from Deadwing - Revenant and Mother And Child Divided. They are quite different from the other album tracks, which is probably why they were not included on Deadwing, but they'd be right at home on FOABP. So if you are familiar with those tracks, that gives you some idea of what to expect of the new album. <br /> <br />And now, to the album itself. It didn't blow me away the first time I listened to it like Deadwing and In Absentia did. Being much more prog that those two, it wasn't as immediately engaging. But I've listened to it three or four times, and each time liked it better that the last, and already on the second time fell in love with it. Let it grow on you. <br /> <br />The title track I think is only superficially similar to Deadwing: the structure is similar, but the atmospherics are very different, and the riff is the most neurotic SW has ever written; also it's heavier; a great song. My Ashes, oh my! What a beautiful song, a warmer one on an album that is soaked in coldness and alienation; and Richard Barbieri is king. The epic, Anesthesize. It's tempting to liken it to Arriving Somewhere but again, they are quite different. ASBNH is very tightly structured: it sucks you in, gradually winds up to its metal climax, then gradually winds down to the end. By contrast, Anesthesize is looser; it consists of several distinct yet intertwined pieces, and even its lyrics are divided into three parts. The parts may feel disjointed (which some reviewers commented on), and I kinda felt that way myself the first time I heard it. But even on the second time it all fell into place and its sophisticated beauty shone with all its power. Sentimental: does indeed remind of Collapse The Light Into Earth, but not as chilling. Way Out Of Here: another epic, sophisticated track. And the closer, Sleep Together, which brings industrial sound into PTree repertoire; the strings arrangements are indeed fantastic; btw they were done by Dave Stewart, presumably THE Dave Stewart. <br /> <br />Conclusion: FOABP is another unbelievably good album from the best band on the planet. It's a change of direction: I agree that on FOABP the band consolidated the heavier sound of In Absentia and Deadwing with their more prog-oriented records of the 90s. Richard Barbieri on keyboards shines perhaps as never before; Gavin Harrison is still one of the best drummers on Earth; low-profile Colin Edwin pumps bass as good as ever; and Steve Wilson is still a genius. This is a very cold, sad, hauntingly beatiful record. Something tells me the next album will be a little brighter. Positive reaction to FOABP could help :)
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This album is by far the greatest. It includes all of the hits from one of the greatest bands. Almost 20 years of great music compacted into one disc.  It might be a shame that it is one disc, but the music is as clear as the day the band started.  <br />Blondie stayed true to it's roots, even though time changed. <br />Rock on to the future.
B00005JPAO|2.0|While the movie certainly has it's interesting points, the majority of the movie is slow and dragged out well beyond the ammount of content in the movie.  <br /> <br />While there are some interesting things in the movie it is scattered and they seemed to pull in random facts or points of interest in to the movie to fill the 2 hours.
B000O178BY|4.0|I have been a Nine Inch Nails fan only for a few years.. My Nine Inch Nails collection began with there album Broken and I worked my way up from there.. What I've always liked about Nine Inch Nails and there music is on the production side.. the instrumental side alone is just out of this world and insane.. Trent's voice and the passion and emotion that he delivers through out most of his work is very good as well.. and compliments the music very nicely.. When With Teeth came out I was expecting another great album (I was listening to The Fragile often around that time..) but With Teeth was just not great at all.. Yeah there were a couple tracks that I listened to and liked but it was nowhere near the level of The Fragile and The Downward Spiral..<br /><br />When I heard that Nine Inch Nails new album Year Zero was coming out I automatically thought and said to myself.. \\"Not going to get it.. just going to be a waste of money..\\" but after hearing the album on the Nine Inch Nails official website the other night.. the next morning before class I went out and got it..<br /><br />This Year Zero album is very good My favorite tracks so far are \\"The Good Soldier\\" And \\"The Beginning Of The End\\".. I can listen to this whole album and not skip one track.. This is the Nine Inch Nails material that I want.. A major improvement from With Teeth..<br /><br />What I don't like about this album though is that it's very political.. and against George Bush. Now I'm not one that is very fond of George Bush myself.. I'm not too fond of politics for that matter.. But to me music should be away from politics.. Music should be something that you can escape from all the politics and not have to worry about listening to someone putting down your own views as far as \\"Republican\\" or \\"Democrat\\" in a way it's disrespectful.. Music should be open to everybody no matter what your political party is.. But then again.. it's not like artists are forcing us to believe how they do.. right?<br /><br />Get this album.. very good stuff.. I'm sure I will be listening to this album more and more..<br /><br />Justinr /> <br />Get this album.. very good stuff.. I'm sure I will be listening to this album more and more.. <br /> <br /> <br />Justin <br /> <br />
B000MGVCFY|4.0|The focus of this review is sound quality only; as such, it is restricted to the SACD version/disc on this two-disc package. The only reason to pay the cost of these reissues (I suspect most true fans have already bought the five albums released last year) is the high resolution available via the SACD format. If we take for granted that you have the necessary hardware to properly decode/playback this format, then these reissues are well worth the extra cost, as they reveal greater dynamic range, increased resolution and 'air', and a far deeper and wider soundstage (even through two channels). By the way, these are NOT 5.1, but 4.1 (they were sourced from the quad mixes, remember?). Some of the very minor audio drawbacks that plagued the DVD-A 'Perceptions' box-set by the Doors (see my review there for more details) are also present here, but overall, this SACD offers sound quality that comes about as close to the warmth of fine analog as the digital format currently allows. Remember, these recordings (these comments can be extended to include the SACD version of 'Every Good Boy Deserves Favor') are 35+ years old. By the way, the only \\"compression\\" I noticed was when I wore my headphones too tight, so I'm at a loss to explain the observation expressed elsewhere; perhaps Home-Theatre-In-A-Box strikes again, who knows?
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This film, in spite of its sulfuric reputation, and the direct connection established by the media in the recent Virginia Tech massacre case, is a masterpiece. A boy has been privately imprisoned for fifteen years with no explanation at all, and of course no trial. It was a private initiative taken by some kind of criminal organization controlled by some kind of mafia itself organized by the entrepreneurial rich. When he is freed he tries to find out why he had been imprisoned like that and to get even with those responsible for it, hence to get his vengeance. The film is a lot more powerful than that in fact, than a simple vengeance case. He will understand that he had known something he shouldn't have known, and he had used it against a schoolmate of his though he should have known he should have kept it for himself, he should have kept his trap shut. And his talking, even if very little, was enough to cause the suicide of a person, and it is the schoolmate of his and lover of the suicidee that went through with his own justice. The film becomes great when the victim of this imprisonment understand his mistake, his crime, his responsibility in the death of the other person and mutilates his speaking for him never to speak anymore. But then the schoolmate, quite older of course understand that he caused a lot of suffering, the death of his victim's wife for instance and the disappearance of his daughter. He then brings justice back onto himself. And the Old Boy, meaning the boy who got old in this private prison, can finally tell the story, in writ, to a woman friend of his and he finally rediscovers love, even if mute love. And this time the film becomes a rewriting of Oedipus' myth: the criminal, unaware of his crime, blinds himself when he discovers the amplitude of his criminal attitude and will die slowly in poverty, rejection and begging. Here the responsibility is definitely shared, silence is imposed onto the criminal tongue, but death comes to the avenging initial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story. Guilt is always a shared human dimension and punishment must also be shared though some innocent people will pay for the crimes of others and the initial criminal will have to pay more than the subsequent ones. The human species is a very barbaric animal race and yet it is haunted by justice.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneinitial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Can't add much to what Chris Luallen said about a good morality story with simplistic characters. I loved the movie nonetheless because of the journey these 3 young girls make across 1500 miles, much of which is desert. I do wish like Chris, that they had gone into more depth of their characters. Not to mention some depth into any of the characters. Not even the school master, the tracker, the people that help them along their sojourn, or any other character with any time on screen. We never feel we really know any of them. Still a great story about how between 1905 and 1970 the Austrailian government took half cast children and made orphans of them. I recommend it as a rental, but you may find it doesn't have much replayability because of the lack of character development.
0553260111|4.0|While reading Ludlum in between more artistic works of literature, I like to follow a good spy/action novel. Ludlum provides! Bourne Identity REALLY provides! It went through all things a good Ludlum novel ought to go through: action packed, twisting plots, romance, conspiracy, character thoughts, and, unfortunately, repetition. Five of those six are gems, but the repetition wore me out nearing the end. I can only read \\"Charlie is for delta; delta is for Cain\\" (or something like that) so many times... then I have to cringe, bite my lip and suppress an urge to scream at the annoyance.<br /><br />If you could have someone black-out all these lines in the book before you read it, it would make the read so much more enjoyable.
B000F3A7LO|3.0|I'm not sure that this 'two versions' of the same work is worth upgrading to. If you have the original cd maybe because of the sound enhancement it would be worth it. But if you are buying it to hear how some songs sounded when originally they were (must of the songs) sang by great Philly singer Hall, of Hall & Oates, then you might be dissapointed at how mediocre he sounds here compared to Hammill (the final choice in at least 4 songs). I like Hall's 2 songs on the original 'Exposure'...he just does not seem the right choice on the other original songs. Peter Hammill saved the day in those songs and who ever chose him made a wise decision.

B0002OERI0|5.0|If someone would have told me 10 years ago that I would be praising a Green Day album as one of the best of the year (circa 2004), I would have said they were insane.  Although I have always kind of liked Green Day's brand of pop / punk I honestly never thought they were capable of something like this.  \\"American Idiot\\" is a concept album in the true sense of the word, telling a narrative story in a fashion normally reserved for the progressive rock world.  I would almost call this album progressive punk in its feel, and in some ways reminds me of the classic Who concept album \\"Quadrophenia\\".   Green Day is a fine example of a band that has grown and matured over their career.  When they first started out I don't think many people would have guessed that they would still be relevant a decade later.  Not only is the band still relevant, but with \\"American Idiot\\" I think they have moved into territory where they can probably be around as long as they want too.  The concept is a strong one telling the story of \\"Jimmy\\" (another possible nod to \\"Quadrophenia\\"?), and his friends, acquaintances, and enemies in urban New York.  I could see this thing made into a movie someday.  Along with the strong concept the album is packed full of great songs.  Several huge hits came from the disc including the title track, \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", and several others.  The music, although still maintaining it's punk roots, explores a multitude of styles that work on many different levels.  I really like every song on the album.  It may sound strange for an old progressive rocker like me to be praising Green Day, but this album really is that good.  If you like a good concept album this gets my highest recommendation.
B0000025D0|5.0|This is my favorite Springsteen album.  I play it quite often, and the songs are equally angry, sad, poetic, and haunted.  Badlands, the title track, and Adam Raised a Cain are brutal and brilliant.  Adam especially is a really scorching track.  Racing in the Street is one of Bruce's most despairing songs, but it's still quite moving.  You can really feel the desperation of the characters in the song.  Even the lesser tracks like Factory (a song I like a lot) have a world weariness and power to them that most artists today can't even come close too.  The Promised Land is another great Bruce anthem, one of his greatest songs.  The cover is really something.  It looks like Bruce just woke up, and you have to give him credit for making himself look so average.  Most rockers wouldn't do that, because they're so obsessed with their image.  I think this is Bruce's best work.

B00005JOFQ|1.0|OK rake me over the coals, but I was stunned at how poor this movie was.The romance between two men(big deal) was very poorly done. If this had been a male/female romance everyone would say, \\"It's alright\\" and not much else. The actor do a good job, but the script is just not up to their performances(yes it did win an Oscar). Another problem I had with this was the tent scene, the brightness is so low that on the three T.V.'s that I tried to watch it on, I had to turn the brightness all the way up just to see the scene. It makes me wonder if the studio hedged it's bet by making it so dark that maybe it wouldn't offend as much. I tried 6 disc and had the same problem on all of them. Some of you are going to say that maybe I'm homophobic, but that's your problem not mine,I just didn't find the movie that good and the brightness issue strikes me as a form of censorship and I won't tolerate that at all. Shame on you Universal for not having the backbone to stand behind your film. I may not like it, but for the ones who do they deserve better than that. <br />

B000AYEL6U|5.0|It was a fortunate thing indeed when my professor for Intro to British Lit ordered North and South to be bundled with the 3 pack Norton Anthology I was suppose to have. I bought my books before my spring break and thought it would be nice and relaxing to read a good book after my finals. I started the first chapter but because I was on break with my cousin, there were other things I needed to do and didn't have the time or the pleasure to leisurely read North and South at my own pace. So I did a little searching because I vaguely remember that there must be a BBC adaption for it. I was right. I went to Le Video straight away to rent it.<br /><br />As I popped in the DVD in my laptop, wonderful music began playing (I'm the type who likes background orchestrated music). Then the wonderful story began to unfold and I fell in love with the characters...especially Mr. Thornton and the actor Richard Armitage, hahahaha *blush*. Anyway, the real factory scene was amazing, the cotton looked like snow (but it's hazardous to breathe it in), and the cramped living spaces in Milton was actually a refresher for me after seeing so many other scenes of country houses in other BBC productions. Now that I am back in school and reading North and South, I find the book equally interesting because Gaskell describes the characters in great detail which I can't really see on the screen.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think North and South (which portrays the industrial society) is much better than Pride and Prejudice (which has more fluff and decadence). So if ever one is in a British Drama mood, one must see North and South which has become my all time favorite BBC mini series EVER!!
B000NDIAWO|2.0|I had reviewed the first edition of B'Day and called it \\"Business day\\" because Beyonc&eacute; could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed \\"Dangerously in Love\\"... No hating, just expected more from an artist who really possess the potential to deliver music that can stand the taste of time!<br />Actually, in my opinion if Ne-Yo had not inserted \\"Irreplaceable\\" in this project, it could have been a bust. I agree D&eacute;j&agrave;-Vu and Beautiful liar were hits but I give the credit to the casting rather than the script.<br /><br />Ne-Yo confessed that the R&B genre is suffering from serious malaise. \\"People just forgot what it was supposed to be, what it was supposed to feel like, the essence of what it is,\\" he says forcefully. \\"It's a vibe, it's a feeling -- it's supposed to make you feel something, as opposed to, `Let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it.' Come on man. There's more to it than that...\\". Citation ends here.<br /><br />Although Ne-Yo wasn't mentioning Beyonc&eacute;, in my own oppinion, I think \\"Ring the alarm\\" and \\"Get me bodied\\" from B'Day fall in the above mentioned category.<br /><br />It is very sad to see artists (especially hip-hop) concentrating on making hits, shooting hot videos with the ambition of going platinum and most of the time I find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers. What follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records.<br /><br />I agree bootylicious Beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment (watch the hot video \\"Upgrade U\\"... she's so classy & sexy) and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s.th that can reach our soul.<br />There are some female artists who are making decent music without realising spanish, chinese or indian album editions to boost sales: Corrine Bailey Rae and Heather Headley!

B000NA28IE|1.0|My husband said it all with these words: \\"If we had bought this movie, I'd throw it in the trash right now.\\" We are fans of the book. This movie slaughters it. <br /> <br />It's like the writers/producer/director took all of the elements of the book, dropped them in a hat, and randomly pulled them out to make the movie. At the end of the movie, not all of the pieces are there, and they're completely out of order.  This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The worst part is it is left open at the end for a sequel--that would be a travesty. <br /> <br />One review suggested that they scrap this movie and start over. That's the only way to do it. Some may say that the book is too complex to translate into a movie, but it can be done--look at Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I say that if you can't do the book justice, just leave it alone.

B00005JPAO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to say about Stephen Frears' Oscar-winning film, THE QUEEN, that had not already been seen.  The movie has played for months on end in San Francisco art theaters, but never once reached my local suburb, so it probably also never played in small towns across America.  That was my key, along with friends wanting MY personal take on this Best Picture Oscar nominee and Actress winner when it FINALLY got onto DVD.<br /><br />For starters, Helen Mirren gives one of the great performances of all time and richly deserved the thousand awards she has gotten as Queen Elizabeth II.  But she could not do much if Peter Morgan's award-winning script were not as brilliant as it is; the same goes for Frears' magnificent direction.  The movie got Oscar-nominated in several major categories, including Picture and Direction and Actress; I would have added Production Design.  On a mediocre audio commentary, Frears and Morgan curiously ridicule and bad-mouth their own movie in terms of jokes and wrong locations because of a low-budget.  Actually, this is a very handsome-looking film in terms of sets and costumes.  So when you play this DVD, do ignore the Morgan and Frears audio commentary, and maybe try a second one with a British historian and royal family author.  Or just listen to the movie \\"cold\\".<br /><br />What we have here is a fascinating and insightful drama about the week following Princess Diana's car crash death in 1997 Paris, as filtered through the perspective of the Royal family who are at Balmoral, their hideaway in the Scottish highlands (rich location filming).  Morgan's screenplay gives us a day-by-day portrait of the conflict between the Monarchs and the Blairs, Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair (a marvelous Michael Sheen), fresh young blood versus a centuries-old conservative monarchy.  We observe, like flies on a wall, how the death of Diana is viewed by both the Queen and Tony.  The Blairs side with the British public, who adored Diana.  They want the flag over Buckingham Palace flown at half-mast, even though the Royal family is in Scotland for the week, and they want a public statement from the Queen.  As more and more flowers pile up outside Buckingham Palace, where people are holding a vigil all week and impatiently waiting for their queen to show herself, Elizabeth reads the various newspapers criticizing her.  She did not like Diana that much and views this as very much a private funeral.  THE QUEEN is rich in character more than plot.<br /><br />Eventually, the public gets its wish for a flag at half-mast, a public TV statement by a queen who barely feels and coldly recites the words she is saying, and a walk among the thousands of people behind police barriers.  The loveliest scene, or at least my favorite, has a little girl giving the Queen a bouquet of flowers.  \\"For me?\\" she inquires softly.  \\"Thank you,\\" she says with true sympathy.  Mirren is just towering and flawless in her Oscar-winning role, reason enough to watch THE QUEEN.  But Sheen, and veteran Sylvia Sims and Oscar-nominee James Cromwell, are also excellent as the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, respectively.  The movie should also have gotten a Makeup Oscar nomination since Mirren is beautiful and sexy in real life and looks nothing like Elizabeth.  But with the right white wig and reading glasses and a soft accent, she IS the Queen.  (You might want to watch the film with the English subtitle captions turned on to catch all of the dialogue.)<br /><br />The DVD for THE QUEEN is letterboxed at 1.85, middle-range wide-screen.  (There is also a pan/scan full screen version.)  Like I said earlier, it has two audio commentaries, and the one I played with the director and writer does the movie a real disservice by constantly pointing out all its flaws.  But there is also a very good and informative 20 minute filmmaking documentary and chat with the cast.  It got a PG-13 rating for \\"brief language\\" which bypassed me; I'd give thefilm a \\"PG\\" instead for all ages.  This could be a thrilling English history lesson supplement in high schools and colleges.  Happy viewing!

0713992867|1.0|Pity Mr. Diamond should have chosen precisely such an important matter to ride the wave of his Pullitzer for a hasty cash harvest. I can see why he did, it is such a popular subject nowadays that it just couldn't fail to yield bountifully but we, the people on this sorry spinning ball, deserved better. Yet another wasted chance to pass this important message through.<br /><br />Disappointment is generously served in various flavors in this book. You get a cold platter of the plain kind of the stuff from the patchy approach (yes, very common indeed in this field, but then, I was expecting more from such an acclaimed author) Then a basket of letdown with the shallow and wrong economic reasoning it uses, a cup full to the rim of frustration with the wrong historical data (Valencia in Spain a place of ancestral small sustainable communities of irrigating farmers????? yeah, right, it must be the golf course mowers... who pay for water a tenth of its transport cost, let alone market or environmental costs!), mousse of emptiness at the nonexistent but thoroughly anticipated chapter on welfare economics... and a bitter dessert made with this yet another failure to pass the important message it promised.<br /><br />Most certainly, the problem must have not been lack of importance of the matter. To promise enlightenment and not deliver is a hefty responsibility when one chooses to delve on such an important subject.<br /><br />Shame on Mr. Diamond for this. Maybe he was not read when small a tale about a boy who cried wolf. It wouldn't surprise me, considering the lack of literary education he shows...
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Immediately, this has to be one of the best Bond flicks to come since \\"Goldeneye\\", and can easily fall somewhere in a top-five list out of the twenty other films. Craig's Bond is a perfect match to the originally written British spy, with shadows of a dark side lingering behind cold blue eyes. If Daniel Craig continues as Bond (new film announced for 2008 - \\"Bond 22\\"), expect Fleming's creation to regain not only lost fans, but a new generation as well. This is simply a fantastic rendition of James Bond! Not to be missed!
0786867973|4.0|This book is beautifully presented and has some real winners, but it would have benefitted from more careful editing and testing.  I'm glad I took the time to look up 'self-rising cake flour' as it seems many disappointed reviewers did not, with disastrous results.  To make self-rising cake flour, simply add about 1 tsp of baking powder per 1 cup of cake flour -- if you substitute regular cake flour, much more common in the US than self-rising, your cakes will not rise properly.  I do think that the editors might have anticipated this problem, and made a small note in the US version of the  book to help novice bakers.  I've had great success with the Victoria Sponge and it's variations, particularly the butterscotch cake -- delicious!!  I also liked the onion pie that another reviewer found underwhelming, but was frustrated at the consistency of the crust -- I followed the recipe carefully, but the crust was still impossibly soft -- I had to scoop it onto the onions, cobbler-fashion, rather than patting it out and draping it, as instructed.  I also recommend increasing the thyme and using sweet yellow onions, as red onions have a bit of a grayish cast after prolonged cooking.  Serve with a green salad for a very nice lunch indeed!  Today I made the 'burnt butter brown sugar cupcakes' and found that the recipe makes only 9 cupcakes, rather than the dozen promised, and I had to scrape every last bit of batter to get those!  Since this is for my youngest child's 1st birthday, I'm a little disappointed that there won't be 1 for each month of his life, but if the aroma and appearance are any indication, these will be delicious!  To be fair, they did rise quite a bit and I suppose I could have eeked out a dozen smaller cupcakes, but next time I'll increase the recipe by half.  I can't recommend this for novice or timid bakers, nor for blind followers -- be sure to read through the recipe and compare mentally with your knowledge and experience before beginning.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Bob Dylan's 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home is arguably his best work. It includes three of his very best songs, the magical Mr. Tambourine Man, the darkly disparaging It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), and his tale of absolute reality, The Gates of Eden. These three are performed folk style with just an acoustic guitar and harmonica. On the album's first song, Subteranean Homesick Blues, Dylan rap-sings forboding lyrics over an electric guitar blues. He then rocks Maggie's Farm, becomes a surreal storyteller in Bob Dylan's 115th Dream, folk-sings his obligatory hate-song, It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, and even rolls out a love song (sort of) with Love Minus Zero/ No Limit, were he sings words of praise about the woman he loves.<br /><br />  My love she speaks like silence,<br />  Without ideals or violence,<br />  She doesn't have to say she's faithful,<br />  Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.<br /><br />Pure Dylan. Bringing It All Back Home has everything for the Bob Dylan fan. Folk songs, rock songs, and classic Dylan lyrics. It's a great album from a great artist at his very best.
1582701709|5.0|I throughly enjoyed The Secret.  I thought it would be like most infomercials, but in book form.  I was skeptical at first, but after a few pages, I realized it was making me think, in a more positive way.  I deliberately read it over a few days, and realized I was taking on a more positive attitude.  By doing so, I was becoming a more tolerant and happy person.  Who wouldn't want that to happen to them?  You have to be more open minded and read it, even if you have your doubts.  Read this book, and finish it.  If this book doesn't change your attitude for the better, then you want to be negative!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's latest album Continuum is an instant classic.  He has many great songs that are beautifully written and every single song is high enough in quality to be released as a single.  He has taken a different path since the early days of his bubble gum pop days from his early albums.  His early albums seemed very commercially influenced and in some instances overly pop.  On his NEW album it is evident that it is more of John himself and a little freer from outside influences.  I have been a fan of John's because he has in the past had some very interesting and catchy guitar work that I enjoyed playing over the last few years.   His guitar work on this album has been changed on many songs much to my pleasure to a more classic blues influenced style, come songs unmistakably reminiscent of B.B. King and other greats (\\"I don't trust myself (with loving you)\\").  He sings songs of love, songs of life, and even some political messages to be put across with his first single off of the album \\"Waiting on the world to change.\\"  John also even revamped a Hendrix song \\"Bold As Love\\" with a brilliant guitar solo with incredible energy to boot.  Some of his songs have an old school R&B sound and he so well meshes many styles together with great songwriting, great lyrics, and great guitar work.  If you are a fan of the MUSIC and enjoy tasteful creative and sometimes even clever lyrics I would strongly advise you to pick up Continuum.  If you are thinking you will be hearing 12 \\"Your Body is a Wonderlands\\" you are in for a pleasant surprise when you hear Quality music flowing into your ears.
B000059MEK|5.0|Sometimes, you will listen to a really great album, then when you're done listening, you'll wonder, \\"Wow, that was great! How do those guys write songs like that?\\". That may be a question to ponder about Daft Punk. While their music contains an element of minimalism (and there's nothing wrong with that), there's just something about their songwriting that captures me. Now for those of you that haven't read any of my other reviews, I listen to a wide variety of music (which is not only fun for me, but a great thing to do as I am a musician and should gather aspects from various forms of music), and no matter what, I think that Daft Punk's, \\"Discovery\\" has something for everybody. <br />     I bought this album when it first came out. Granted, I was younger than and, like my other friends that loved Daft Punk, I thought of it as very entertaining. However, I still do now, and I love these guys even more for their talent and creativity. <br />\\"One More Time\\": A great way to start off the album, this song being just about infectious as you can imagine. I love that mystical, spacey break in the middle with just a swirling synth note and Romanthony's digital voice. This is endless fun and I'm sure you'll love it. <br />\\"Aerodynamic\\": The energy that this song displays lets you know that it's all right for you to let loose, as well. The speedy riff and Yngwie Malmsteen-esque guitar solo make this another great song. As a guitarist and guitar aficianado, this is especially a great song. <br />\\"Digital Love\\": Picks off right where \\"Aerodynamic\\" left off, with the ringing bell, progressing into a lush riff and lyrics that kind of remind me of those arena rock/hair metal ballads of the '70s and '80s. This a very beautiful, happy, and overall wonderful song that will leave you feeling great. And you gotta give it up for the outstanding guitar solo! I printed the tab for it and am currently trying to perfect it, even if it takes some time. Great song and an essential part of thealbum. <br />\\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\": Definitely a great song, and the interesting part of this song is the lyrical flow. At first, they seem to be just short passages of words, but eventually flow into each other to create one awesome groove, complimented by the cool, digital vocals. Believe me, you'll love this song. <br />\\"Crescendolls\\": A funny keyboard line that I would probably wanna learn (yeah, I'm a keyboardist, too!), and a crowd shouting things like, \\"Hey!\\", and \\"Whoo!\\". Just goes to show how good Daft Punk will make you feel. <br />\\"Nightvision\\": Bring out your lover, it's time for a love-making session! Love the airy synths on here and the electronic percussion. As one reviewer previously started, this is quite a sexy number. \\"Nightvision\\" makes for a great love-making song, but then again, the whole album ironically does. Just another thing to love about \\"Discovery\\"! <br />\\"Superheroes\\": Starts off with some snare drumming, then a heavy, throbbing bass drum, and some vocals that seem to be purposely recorded backwards. Love the keyboard work here, this would be another song I would wanna learn on my keyboard. This song basically displays the aura of \\"superheroes\\" as best as possible in four minutes. From the previously mentioned, heroic vocals, keyboard work, and the sexy, feminine vocals, this is one awesome song! <br />\\"High Life\\": Don't really listen to this song much, but it has more feminine vocals, if I recall correctly. <br />\\"Something About Us\\": A very romantic song with lyrics that could be used as words in a movie with a dramatic romance scene. The interesting part of this song that should be noted is the gutteral bass and keyboard combo. Very interesting, although somewhat unusual, it works. <br />\\"Voyager\\": Man alive, these guys can do it all! In just 3:45, Daft Punk combines funky guitars, throbbing basses, danceable drumbeats and techno keyboards into a fantastic, epic, spacey and just about perfect tune! This takes me on a space voyage, and always makes me think of just drifting out in the distant galaxy. You're gonna love this one! <br />\\"Veridis Quo\\": Don't really listen to this song as much as some others, either, but it's got some nice flute work. <br />\\"Short Circuit\\": The first minute and a half is all right, but the rest of the song kinda declines from there. Don't worry, the first, 90 seconds is enough, as it's got some amazing electronic keyboard usage. The main riff is kind of goofy, but enjoyable, and the soloing is quite on the freaky-naughty make-out side of things. Very cool. <br />\\"Face To Face\\": I love the guitar riff, and the opening drum rhythm really works. More purposely recorded backwards vocals are here, along with some interesting lyrics that could mean a lot of things, depending on where you stand. If you listen closely enough, you'll hear distant, background violins in the second use of the chorus in this song. It just adds a lot of meaning to this song and along with the rest of it, it's just so good. <br />\\"Too Long\\": Aptly titled name, with this song being at ten minutes, but it's terrific nevertheless. This song has probably the most vocal usage of all the songs, I love how it becomes muffled towards the end and adds pumping, keyboard lines. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />This album has something for everybody, with its fourteen songs running at about 61 minutes. I still listen to it and am really glad that I got it. This would make a great album to listen to while cruising in the nighttime, chilling out in your room, or makin' love with your lover. It's great for all of these things, and I hope it makes a great addition to your musical library. See you later!
1400063515|5.0|This is an entertaining and enlightening book, and fairly easy to read.  It has an important message regarding how the world works; that the world is governed not by the predictable and the average, but by the random, the unknownable, the unpredictable -- big events or discoveries or unusual people that have big consequences.  Change comes not uniformly but in unpredictable spurts.  These are the Black Swans of the title: completedly unexpected and rare events or novel ideas or technologies that have a huge impact on the world.  Indeed, Taleb argues that history itself is primarly driven by these Black Swans.    It is convincing argument, entertainingly presented with plenty of sarcasm, and indeed, anger, by Taleb.  For example he rails against the academic community, economists (including specific names), and Nobel Prize committee.  Considerable numbers of his arguments \\"ring true\\" to me, that is my experience in life confirms that they are more accurate than the traditional approach.  Like any important work, 90% of what is in the book is not original; that does not make it less important.  Taleb's contribution is in integrating the material together, and showing how these different ideas are tied to the Black Swan.    The themes include: winner-take-all phenonomen, numerous effects of randomness on the world, the invalidity of the Gaussian Bell Curve to most things in world, concepts of scalablity, numerous instabilities in the world, especially the modern world where information travels so quickly, the fallacies about people's inability to predict the future.  The importance of these ideas, Taleb's ability to weave them together into a single theory, and the ability of this theory to change the way you look at the world, means the book easily deserves my highest recommendation.    However, the book does have many flaws, unfortunately -- unfortunate because I believe they will take away from the credibility of the message, which is in important one.  The are numerous minor flaws such as, for example, the inexplicable invention of a fictional author (disclosed a few pages later), when certainly there must have been some real example that would have worked better.  Another example is repeated jabs about the French; these may be amusing but I just don't think they have a place in work like this.  There are also diatribes against specific people, including famous economists, which, though amusing, and possibly justified, demonstrate a high level of anger by author and take away from his credibility.  Often he also overreaches, for example in saying the usual combination of anti-abortion and pro-death penalty or the opposite combined views of pro-abortion and anti-death penatly cannot be explained logically, when in fact widely known theories such as George Lakoff's (in Moral Politics) have explained hows these groups of views are entirely consistent.      Another flaw is that Taleb seems to go a little toward the extreme of saying that we can predict almost nothing about the future, and though he does not say so explicitly, this seems to imply we have no moral responsibility to the future.  This, combined with Taleb's advice to the reader about their behavior based on the \\"Black Swan\\" view of world just rubbed me the wrong way, for several reasons.  One is that Taleb personally has very little in common with most people; never having as far as I know had a regular career (essentially what he calls non-scalable, e.g. dentist, engineer, baker) he nevertheless recommends that people choose these kinds of careers rather than a scalable career (e.g. financial trader, author, actor which are subject to a few lucky successful people and a lot of failures).  This advise is odd first because Taleb is in a non-scalable profession (derivatives trader, then hedge fund manager) -- indeed it appears he is quite wealthy.   Even more odd because he says all these types of non-scalable types of work are boring and evens makes sarcastic comments(the book is extremely sarcasm heavy) for example about dentists being able to do well by diligently drilling teeth for 30 years.  The second things that bothered me is that Taleb seems be somewhat amoral to me; in this type of book where plenty of his own emotions come through, plenty of his personality, he has plenty of criticism of others for their wrong models and wrong view of the world, and how this has hurt the world, but there remains a lack of moral responsibility to his advice.    Perhaps the best comparison I could make are to other important works that do not suffer from these flaws, for example the Age of Fallibility by George Soros and Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller (1st and 2nd editions).  But probably Black Swan will sell better than either of these because of it's \\"edginess,\\" i.e. aggresiveness; I personally have a distaste for this approach.    Despite my criticisms, the main ideas of the book as so important as to merit reading and indeed great consideration.
B000002GFC|5.0|It's rather amusing to think that Cream formed over 40 years ago. They were so revolutionary, just about everything they did left a huge influence on rock bands to come. Ginger Baker is an insane drummer, and was one of, if not the very first, to use a double bass drum the way he did. Jack Bruce invented and perfected that fade-in bass technique and Eric Clapton...well, when you hear the man rip it out on this album, you know these guys were something special. <br /> Cream was one of the first power trios around. Right after them emerged bands like Blue Cheer, Rush and The Jimi Hendrix Experience, but seriously, how many guys were playing like the boys of Cream were in '66? Now, honestly speaking, I was fairly skeptical when purchasing this, at first at least, due to the fact that I saw Clapton listed as the second greatest rock guitarist of all time. Anybody who ranks high on a list has got to be there for a reason, and he proved it to me. I literally started laughing when I heard the blazing solos on songs like \\"Sweet Wine\\" and \\"NSU\\". The last time I heard a guy that great was somebody like Eddie Van Halen or the legendary Jimi Hendrix, (I got into Hendrix before I became a guitarist, and VH just as I started.)  <br /> Clapton, Bruce and Baker form a magnificent band and the songwriting is just as strong as the musicianship. From the epic lyrics in \\"Tales of Brace Ulysses\\" to the timeless riff on \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", these guys could do it all. They went from psychedelic rock, blues rock, proto-metal, jazz fusion, jam rock, and a fusion of all of those elements to make a signature sound that made them the prototypical blues-rock trio that they were. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />- You get 20, great songs on this album. <br />- I've seen it on sale for as low as ten bucks. <br />- The liner notes are great, and you gotta love the psychedelic colors in the inner and outer covers! <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- Not too many negativities here, except for the recording technique that was used on the tracks from their debut, \\"Fresh Cream\\". All of the instruments are to the right and the vocals are to the left, for the most part. I would've thought that the record company would've fixed that! Oh well, it's just for a few tracks that the production is messed up. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />If you're just getting into Cream, this will make for a great album. Don't have any doubts when buying this, because you get plenty of songs at a great price. It's too bad these guys only lasted for a short time, but they really made magic in the period that they did. Cheers, and peace!
B000MV9026|5.0|Not much to say except I LOVED it.  I could not wait to get it on DVD so I can watch it over and over again.  I made my friends and beau watch it as well...they were not as excited as I was but they di dlike it. My beau even bought me a little penguin.  :-)  I thin a lot of people dont' liket he story line because it may hit too close to home.  Maybe they did not have a heart song when they were younger, ie. THE ODD BALL OUT or maybe they don't like \\"other\\" kinds of people...think the Mexican short penguins...\\"different\\".  Is it so bad to put focus on something that is a problem...not just for the penguins but for most arctic creatures?  As humans we only want to take, take, take and rerely give back.  What will happen when we finally reap the harvest of what we are sowing?  So get a grip people and look in the mirror before you go making up excuses for wahat is \\"wrong\\" with a cartoon that actually makes you think for a change and will lead to interesting conversations with your children.
B000I0QLZU|1.0|When the Lara Croft video game was released it was so ahead of its time, it influenced and changed the video game industry. <br />It would have been nice if the Lara Croft series could continue its revelutionary approach by producing a crystal clear version of this 7 year old movie. But seeing the way how they prepared the title for HD, its apparent that the producers dont have big expectancies from this old lady. <br />The movie is very much grainy, there are even scratches and glares. I am not impressed with the audio as well.  <br />The HD version has absolutely Zero upgrade value. <br />There are many extras but as i dont have the DVD im not sure if they are special for this version or not.
B00006879E|4.0|I have had this CD for a couple of years, but apart from harder to breathe, and This Love, I wasn't feeling this CD as a whole. Fast forward to April 2007. I put the whole album onto my MP3 player, and like wow! It was like listening to a completely new CD. The first song that lept out at me was 'Sweetest Goodbye', which I kept on constant auto play, great song. Then 'Secret' wrapped it tender grooves around my ears, soon followed by 'Tangled'. Now I'm at the point that I can listen and appreciate and listen to the whole CD. The funk/soulfullness of this offering, allied with Adam Levines great vocal are a devasting combination that works, and works throughout this CD. Can't wait for the sophmore joint.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Rita Hayworth radiates superabundant sensuality as the magnetic center of this film. Hayworth's beauty stands outside of time; her changing moods and expressions affect us powerfully, at a pre- or nonverbal level. (Therefore most attempts to analyze this film fail, beyond general statements about Hayworth as an iconic femme fatale). There is an overwhelming ambiguous sexuality permeating the film, almost palpable, which also explains its enduring appeal. Ballin (George Macready) voyeuristically pushes Johnny (Glenn Ford) toward his wife Gilda (Hayworth). But there is an equally strong sexual attraction/undercurrent between Ballin and Johnny throughout, never resolved, and the \\"happy ending\\" has a tacked-on quality, as though merely to satisfy convention and audience expectations. The strange nature of love and love-hate is wonderfully explored by this unusual love triangle. A very handsome and suave Argentine police official/detective (Joseph Calleia) is thrown in for good measure. This film deals with eternal truths about masculinity, femininity, and the dark, complex and unpredictable forces of sexuality. How the U.S. could have slipped into the anodyne sanitized 1950s after films like this is a mystery to me. Watching Hayworth perform makes it clear that most so-called \\"stars\\" of today are absurd nonentities.
B000M341QE|4.0|But then when isn't he.  All the actors were wonderful, the story was tense and well done.  And, very believeable.  It's not the criminals we have to worry about it's our government, they're the real crime lords. Wake up people.    Enjoy!
0316010669|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As a non-fiction piece it is a quick, easy, compelling and even entertaining read.  It's real value to me was in the individual anecdotes, particularly the ones about the Cook County Hospital and heart attack cases, the case of discrimination against women in European orchestras, and the Milennium Challenge in the Persian Gulf military exercise,  all of which show how `thinking differently' can solve big problems without extended hand wringing, reports, and excessive committee meetings, the result being quick effective decisions.  The documented studies he offers in some instances are helpful in justifying his conclusions. <br /> <br />Gladwell addresses what must surely have crossed all our minds more than once, that too much information is just that - too much information.  (In our `information age', internet-connection, and cell-phone-texting times, we are prone to just such overload, in my opinion.)  But Gladwell shows how little information is very often needed for good decision making.  He does not offer a formula, but rather stimulates thought about decision making, about the value of split decisions as well as the need in some cases for a more analytical approach.  The challenge, in my opinion, is knowing when which application is appropriate.  The value of experience is validated in this book. <br /> <br />I would not want to have missed this book.  It's too easy to get swept along in the information age, and miss our most valuable personal assets, our own experience.  Gladwell helps. <br />
B000O75F7C|5.0|You know how worried you get that bands' subsequent releases are not going to measure up to the past?  No worries here. This disk is simply amazing.  Even for the \\"mellow fans\\" whose favorite song is Lazarus (from Dead Wing), there is something for you on FOBP.  I read a past review that said this was HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY ... so I was a concerned it might be too Metal.  No need to worry.  It's heavy in that it's deep and lush.  I love music that makes percussion an integral part of the experience--instead of just keeping time.  The percussion in this is great even for PT.<br /><br />I might be PT's oldest fan.  Look for me at the front of the line in Boulder on 15 May.  Can't wait.
B00000IFP6|4.0|Jonathan del Mar, son of Philharmonia Orchestra musician Norman del Mar, spent a great many years working on a \\"critical edition\\" of the Beethoven Symphonies using Beethoven's original manuscripts and comparing them, bar-by-bar and note-for-note, with the published editions.  The result was the Barenreiter-Edition, first recorded here (and, to my knowledge, ONLY recorded here) by the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra and conductor David Zinman. <br /> <br />First, let me say that I have only the highest respect for Zinman.  He is one of my favorite conductors, and I have long felt that only the lack of a high-powered agent has kept him from being one of the world's best-known podium masters.  But in these performances, using the \\"critical edition\\" as a sort of leash, there is little or no rubato at all, except for some very, very subtle modifications in the Adagios and in the Allegretto finale of the Sixth Symphony.  Otherwise, this is Beethoven in VERY strict tempos, and I do mean strict: the tenor solo of the Ninth is taken at such a clip that it's difficult to imagine any other tenor, in live performance, agreeing to be subjected to it.  The oft-maligned Toscanini sounds like a mere snail in comparison. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, there are some good things and good performances.  Despite a second-movement \\"Andante cantabile con moto\\" taken at an incredibly brisk \\"con moto,\\" his reading of the First Symphony is supremely satisfying, the best I have heard since Munch and Toscanini.  His \\"Eroica\\" completely vindicates the Toscanini approach as every single movement is taken quicker than the Italian Maestro did it (the second movement \\"Marcia funebre\\" at least six per cent quicker), and I was surprised to hear the famous Trio taken with a repeat.  His Fourth is the most satisfying reading since the 1939 Toscanini broadcast, and his Sixth has the most ingratiating \\"At the brook\\" and \\"Joyous merrymaking after the storm\\" since the equally old 1939 Toscanini-BBC Symphony recording.  (Herbert von Karajan, in his last Beethoven symphony cycle, also took the Sixth at written pace but with a much stiffer, less flexible rhythm, which nullified its pastoral effects.)  In addition, I heard little turns in the wind instruments in the first movement that are not evident, or at least not as cleanly played, in any other recording or performance I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Yet, as an overall set of the Nine, it remains a learning device for burgeoning conductors and not an edition that one will turn to time and time again for interpretive inspiration.  For this I do not particularly blame Zinman, who was making a point, but he could have and should have \\"lived\\" with these new scores for a few years, modified his interpretations somewhat, and THEN have recorded his mature, seasoned reflections on them. Also, and I hate to be the one to carp about this, but WHY are the vocal soloists in practically every Ninth Symphony since Karajan's last one simply horrible??  Zinman is scarcely alone here: Haitink, Dohnanyi, Robert Shaw and anyone else of worth also have woefully inadequate singers on their Ninths.  But of course, I happen to be very particular about singers anyway, so my favorite Beethoven Ninths are always defined by both the conducting and the vocal quartet, my picks being Toscanini 1939 (Novotna, Thorborg, Peerce, Moscona), Schmidt-Isserstedt 1967 (Sutherland, Horne, King, Talvela) and Karajan 1977 (Tomowa-Sintow, Baltsa, Schreier and Van Dam).  I exclude 1952 Toscanini, even though his quartet was wonderful, simply because I have always been uncomfortable with his pacing and phrasing on that particular Ninth (no, it's not too fast, on the contrary, it's the slowest of all his Ninths, but the music just doesn't flow - everything sounds \\"vertically\\" phrased.) <br /> <br />Anyway, those are my thoughts regarding this set.  I don't think you'll find finer modern (within the last thirty years) performances of the First, Third, Fourth or Sixth anywhere, but I prefer Karajan's 1977 readings of the Second, Seventh and Ninth, and his 1983 version3 of the Fifth and Eighth. <br />
B00006RCOB|3.0|I'm not sure whether Firefox is really a guilty pleasure or simply a film I remember as being one. It's certainly overlong and overfamiliar despite its neat Maguffin - Clint Eastwood's flashback-plagued Vietnam vet fighter ace has to steal a state-of-the-art warplane with a thought-controlled weapons system (as long as you remember to think in Russian) from the heart of the Evil Empire - but it has a sort of undemanding Cold War charm that the constant stream of clichés only reinforces. Even the old school model effects in the final chase-and-dogfight section are more fun in their way than modern CGI effects, especially when the Firefox is leaving a wall of water in its wake as it races across the sea or causing fallen snow to fill the air as it passes over the mountains, so it's a shame that much of the last third is played in darkened control rooms rather than the skies.    The Russians, naturally, are mostly played by British actors, albeit in this case actors best known for their sitcoms, which adds a different dimension to their scenes as comically humourless KGB types or lemming-like dissidents only too happy to die for the cause, or incorrigible hams like Freddie Jones who simply look like they SHOULD be in a sitcom. There's even an almost admirable perversity into giving most of the explanatory dialogue in the last half-hour to Klaus Löwitsch, an actor with a shaky grasp of spoken English who sounds like a bumblebee caught in a vacuum cleaner pipe. Not good by any means, but strangely watchable, and Maurice Jarre contributes an enjoyable score from the days before he disappeared entirely into atonal electronics.    The Region 1 DVD is the uncut theatrical version before Clint re-edited and trimmed the film by some 12 minutes without visibly improving it for video release (however, the European PAL DVD is the shorter version). Boasting a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, it also includes a 29-minute British behind the scenes documentary and the theatrical trailer.
0156907399|5.0|To the Lighthouse, published in 1927, is a landmark Modernist novel. <br /> <br />Written from multiple perspectives and shifting between time and characters, Woolf is not really concerned with plot. Instead, she paints a psychological portrait of the members of the Ramsay family and their friends, at their summerhouse in the Hebrides. To the Lighthouse is divided into three parts.  <br /> <br />In the first section, (The Window), the character of Mrs. Ramsay is the lens through which most of the perspectives are focused, and her son's (James) desire to go \\"to the Lighthouse\\" is the catalyst from which the chapter takes shape.  <br /> <br />In the next section, (Time Passes), told by an omniscient narrator, Woolf dramatises the decay of the summer house over a period of ten years, and the fate of various characters is divulged. This section has some powerful visual images that expound Woolf's skill as a writer. <br /> <br />In the third and final section, (The Lighthouse), the remaining family and friends finally get to the Lighthouse, and the novel becomes a meditation on love, loss, time and creativity. <br /> <br />To the Lighthouse is a difficult read. But if you can understand the nature of the stream-of-consciousness technique and Woolf's goal of representing the essence of experience, then you will be able to glean a better understanding of the narrative. To the Lighthouse creates internal landscapes, and the main technique is invoking memory and various associations on the thoughts and feelings of the characters. <br /> <br />This book will take time and patience. But if you keep working at it and savour ever word, then you will be in for a rewarding literary experience. <br /> <br />
B000E5N6LG|2.0|This movie was a huge waste of time.  Buy \\"Tombstone,\\" instead.  It's a 5-Star!
B0002IQEHI|5.0|You know from the moment you see Saul Bass's marvellous opening credit sequence that this is going to be a great movie. Add Bernard Herman's classic music score and you are immediately on a great rollercoaster of a film.<br /><br />Hitchcock gets his cameo role out of the way early then Cary Grant enters. At the time he was 55, but no-one ever look better at this age than Grant. Of course he is mistaken for somebody else and the film lifts off. James Mason, Eva Marie Saint and many others play great supporting roles. There are many famous sequences, the crop spraying, the fight on Mount Rushmore its all very well done, cleverly written and directed with Hitchcocks usual style and wit.<br /><br />This was the first film I ever saw on DVD and I was amazed by the quality of the film. The film dates from 1959 but doesn't show it.<br /><br />The extras are very good on this disc. There is full commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman and a 39min documentary. In truth you could watch the film without the commentary, then with the commentary and then watch the documentary and start all over again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Since there are almost 3000 reviews of this by now, I won't go into describing anything, really. I'd never heard of this show, except for a friend who pestered me for the better part of two years to watch it somehow, so I watched just one ep, then bought the DVD set. It's that good.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I am very sad, <br />This work is not art, <br />I think this is [ The Worst Damn Thing ] <br />An ugly and poor sound, <br />She seems to be the lion which was totally tamed, <br />The drying up of talent? <br />I think that I want you to come back to a brilliant artist.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Enjoyable, and well acted. But as with most time travel stories, they trip over their own paradoxes. Answer me this, and if you haven't seen it yet, stop reading. <br /> <br />When Denzel comes across the crashed ambulance, didn't that mean that the hottie was already saved?? <br /> <br />Because, as per the story, he saves the hottie after crashing the ambulance. Granted, it hadn't happened yet, to him, but to his past self in that present time, it had. <br /> <br />Wrap your heads around that one.
B00005JPAO|5.0|From the previews it almost looks like a period piece which might turn alot of people off, but this movie takes place in 1997 the week of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the effect her death had on the british empire and around the world.  I was one year out of high school and on my way to basic training in 1997, to immature and wrapped up in my own mind to understand the impact it had on people, yet watching this movie and seeing the live broadcasts it was touching you could feel it.<br />It deserves it's 6 oscar nominations and one win for Hellen Mirren who does an amazing job.<br />The queen also received 98% positve feedback on rottentomatoes of 166 reviews who can all write better than me.<br />Stephen Frears directs he also directed the grifters and high fidelity both with john cusack, both movies also received 4 stars from the grand pooba of critics roger ebert and made his personal top 10 lists the years they were released.  Roger Ebert being out due to surgery from salivary cancer still reviewed the queen and also gave it 4 stars last year.  You can tell Stephen frears being born in the UK had some fun with this as when Prince Philip tells queen Elizabeth \\"move over cabbage\\" when he jumps into bed.  His movie has a great flow and does a beautiful job with the buck and the queen in the woods which symbolizes Dianna as the queen tries to help it but in the end it was still hunted down by the trackers almost as Dianna was by the paparazzi.  He has a great eye for detail i believe i saw a playstation 1 or a supernintendo on Tony blairs tv set.<br />The movie does not take sides, and it shows us a side of a woman that nobody would get to see other than in a movie, and maybe help the way she is remembered.<br />Thanks for reading.
B000NA28I4|1.0|There wasn't one original idea in the entire film -- just 103 minutes of brain-freezing tedium.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Transcendental is probably the most appropriate word to sum up this documentary. It is a beautiful fusion of stunning visual cinematography, a perfectly orchestrated soundtrack, and the sincere commentary of Sir David Attenborough. <br /> <br />I just made it through the first of five discs last night, and I already feel like I need to re-watch it just to catch a few more details. This is a series that will only improve with time, and each time you watch it, it will continue to get better and better.  <br /> <br />You can literally pause any single frame of the film, hang your TV on the wall and display it as a piece of fine art. With the picture-perfect high definition filming of this movie, I'm actually surprised the production budget was only $25 million.  <br /> <br />Conservation is not an easy topic to persuade the public on, but this is the type of platform that will make waves. Throughout the movie, the undertone for the need to protect and preserve our landscape is ever-present, without being over-ambitious or over-simulated. <br /> <br />Truly a powerful series! <br />
B000000OAL|5.0|and as a matter of fact, can you tell me one better?  IMHO this one shows elements of everything they were to create during their great career.  Man, Freddie is really missed.  I have this feeling that he'd still be rocking with the band, and they would have had a resurgence in popularity here in the States by now.  Big Time.  I was too young to see them live back in the day, but I can imagine it would've been great.   <br /> <br />Anybody wanting to get into Queen-- I say you can pick any of the first several albums to start with.  They are all great in their own respect.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is absolutely gorgeous.  The footage is one of kind and breathtaking (literally) and you will not be disappointed.  Feel good about buying this and supporting this type of documentation of our natural world. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that there is a great deal of focus on hunting by big animals - Discovery Channel style.  Sure, these are interesting and easy to film, but I find the beautiful and artful capture of the lesser known aspects of planet earth to be much, much, much more interesting and provacative.  How many more wildebeasts do we need to see get nabbed by crocs???  I'd rather see amazing new footage of the insects crawling on the riverbanks beside this sort of touristy and over-filmed action.  It would also be nice if more factual information were given in the voiceover, rather than mildly annoying and personification-type narrative. <br /> <br />In summary, Planet Earth is the star of the show and the quality of the new HD footage is clearly evident, even in the DVD.  I highly recommend that everyone add this to the library and that they think hard about the role that every one of us plays in keeping Planet Earth healthy.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|\\"Grey Gardens\\" , \\"Cigarettes And Chocolate Milk\\" , \\"Poses\\" , \\"Across The Universe\\" , \\"Greek Song\\" and \\"California\\" are my favourite songs on the disc. The title song alone makes this cd a stellar accomplishment. Rufus Wainwright has a brilliant sense of melody on Poses. I'm not sure if his other records are half as good as this particular cd. Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk never grows old and sounds refreshing every listen. There are times I want to sing it but Wainwright's flawless voice makes me not want to even try. It has been 8 months since I've been listening to Poses and although there's nothing uplifting about it, I keep coming back to it. \\"Grey Gardens\\" is confusing because I keep forgetting what it is about. A poem, maybe. Nonetheless, a very captivating and differently sung tune. \\"California\\" as the name suggests is fun. \\"Greek Song\\" is the kind of song one gives to his potential girlfriend or girlfriend if they have one. Greek Song is stunning, crisp and consitent much like the album is. The Beatles' Cover of Across The Universe supersedes Fiona Apple's. I love how brash and unapologetic it is. It's amazing that its been six years since this cd came out. If you want to try something else, something more varied lyrics, imagination and melody - I suggest you give the record, \\"Wincing The Night Away\\" by The Shins a try. I doubt Rufus Wainwright has a better record than Poses but do check out the track called \\"What a world\\" cause it's brutally mesmerizing.
0156027321|5.0|It is a great story. It's the story that make you really appreciate the world. <br />Such great book is beyond words to describe it. It's pure chance for you read such a great book. Recommend it for all ages.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|The greatest racing film ever IMHO is John Frankenheimer's classic \\"Grand Prix\\". Nothing else comes close, not even \\"Le Mans\\". This is a must own for any race fan. But the movie is so well filmed and scored, with an interesting enough plot, that a non-race fan should enjoy the movie. <br />That is the sign of a well-made film. 40 years later, it's still fresh and vibrant.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love it. My husband loves it. My 2 year old loves it. Even after years of watching nature shows, \\"Planet Earth', like the 'Blue Planet', continues to surprise, educate, and delight. Simply excellent.  <br /> <br />I hope David Attenborough and the BBC have more on the way, peoples of the earth, the earth itself or ...
B00005V0X5|5.0|This is a great debut album for one of the greatest metal bands of all time. I prefer megadeth to metallica. This is probably the fastest album they put out, it starts fast with last rites/loved to deth and doesnt let up until the last track. Great technical musicianship and catchy riffs flood this album. Its a must own album for any megadeth fan, although i would recommend rust in peace first for newbies.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Why aren't these guys on the radio? Well, I'm doing my part. This past Christmas all my presents included either \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Deadwing\\". The selection as to who got which album was purely random simply because both albums are superb. Everyone, absolutely everyone who got this a part of their gift loved it and bought the counterpart.  <br /> <br />Quite possibly some of the finest mixed and mastered material ever available makes it an even better treat. Wilson is some kind of genius with his use of light versus dark. And now with the release of \\"Blank Planet\\" this completes just an amazing trilogy of albums that are constantly playing back-to-back-to-back in my car, home stereo, and computer.
B00004SA8A|5.0|Kempff himself wrote the liner notes to this highly satisfying set and states the following: \\"The deeper we penetrate into the world of Schubert, however, the greater is our surprise at discovering that the 'heavenly length' for which he is reproached is to be regarded relatively. If the length becomes evident as longueurs, the fault lies with the interpreter (I speak from my own experience...).\\" Indeed, in listening to Kempff play the Schubert sonata canon the thoughts of \\"overly long\\" or \\"needlessly repetitive\\" never entered my head. Barring some extraordinary performances of individual sonatas over the years, such as Richter's old Russian recording of the c minor (D 958) on Melodiya or Serkin's equally old recording of the B-flat (D 960), this is the best playing of the Schubert sonatas I know. <br /> <br />I used to think of some of the earlier sonatas as practice or training pieces for the later masterworks (which of course by definition they are, but they need not be viewed retrospectively from the vantage point of the late works). Unfortunately, they often sound boring and immature. This is due to defects in players and the playing, not a problem with Schubert. Kempff makes all the sonatas here, including the early ones, glow with the utmost musicality so they stand on their own as beautiful works. Just one example: In the earlier of the a minor sonatas he handles little secondary figures that are intercalated within major theme phrases in an amazingly musical and beautiful way. As a pianist myself, I could never figure out how to make them unobtrusive, let alone desirable. Under Kempff's fingers they fit sublimely into the fabric of the work. The playing is clearly layered, every note and phrase has its place and purpose, his internal logic is such that nothing Schubert wrote sounds less than as it should. One more example: The first movement of the G major sonata (\\"Fantasy\\" sonata, D 894) floats in its ethereal haze but goes fast, not slow. Kempff can produce the effect of suspended animation without suspending the actual motion. This is no doubt what Schubert intended but it is very difficult to pull off as a performer. Kempff's treatment of the last 5 sonatas (D, G, A, c minor, and B flat) is breathtaking.  <br /> <br />This set is a revelation. What a magnificent panorama of Schubert's development as a composer! Also, the origins of later composers' styles can be traced to Schubert's writing for piano. The roots of Bruckner's iterated and protracted symphonies can be heard, for example, in the way the finale of the a minor sonata begins. (I don't think this is apparent from other players, who lack Kempff's lyricism and mysticism.) Included beside the actual titled sonatas are various fragments of incomplete sonatas and collections of piano pieces that in effect are untitled sonatas (such as D 459/459A). <br /> <br />The recordings are from around 1965-1970 and the piano sound is singing, glowing, radiant. I recommend this set wholeheartedly to anyone interested in great musicianship, masterly piano playing, Schubert's piano music, and Schubert's evolution as a composer. Kempff makes you realize that the magic didn't all happen in the last year of Schubert's life, and I can't think of another pianist who does that for me. (There are few, if any, major players of Schubert with whom I'm not familiar.) Kempff was the leading German pianist of the immediate post-WW II era, but I think he has largely been forgotten. His Schubert, Beethoven, and Brahms are wonderful. Modern players, despite their steel fingers and elephantine endurance and machine-like (sometimes machine-gun-like) techniques, stand to learn a lot from this old master's art.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|This album is just great from beginning to finish. It is very different than their first album but has a lot of similarities as well which is a good thing.   <br />Key Tracks: 1,2,4,5,7,8,11,and my favorite 12(505).  The whole album is just great.  Other great new albums this year that you should hear, \\"The Shins\\", \\"Modest Mouse\\", \\"The Good, The Bad, The Queen\\", \\"Ted Leo and the Pharmacists\\", \\"Pela\\", \\"Bloc Party\\", \\"The Fratellis\\", \\"Arcade Fire\\", \\"Kings of Leon\\",\\"LCD Sound System\\", and \\"The Noisettes\\". <br />
B0000640VM|4.0|First of all, It's great movie. It has catchy songs, lovable charecters, and finely portrayed setting. The plot was a little questionable, particularly at the end. Stuff happens that really just doesn't make sense, such as a car getting it's tires scraped off from subway rails and having the exposed wheels ride on the rails perfectly. Also the antagonist is a little too evil. Now you might say, \\"he's the antagonist, he's supposed to be evil!\\" but seriously, the way he over-reacts to the smallest of things is just downright corny. For example: grabbing his gun before greeting a pizza delivery person just because he didn't order it.<br /><br />Those are the negative aspects, but I'm sure any kid below the age of 13 isn't even going care about those. The rest of the movie leading up to the end is a great Disney classic.
1400064287|5.0|Richard Dawkin's [[ASIN:B000J4JWUQ The Selfish Gene]] and Malcom Galdwell's [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] compared an idea spreading through a network of people to a virus spreading through a network of people.  The idea's skill at spreading depends on the likelihood of the next person absorbing the idea, the person's level of connectedness to the rest of the network of people, and the person's likelihood of persuading other minds to accept the idea. <br /> <br />Made to Stick seeks to answer a related question: what makes ideas unforgettable?  It points out that urban legends, which lack value and are often easily demonstrated to be false, are very memorable, spread far and wide, and are hard to stamp out. <br /> <br />Made to Stick argues that to be hard to forget an idea must be simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, and told through a story.  The book dissects a great number of ideas to illustrate each of these elements in greater detail.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I saw it at the theater when it first came out and then I bought the book.  The characters seem like real people that a person could meet.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|For starters, I agree with some of the previous reviewers regarding explicit lyrics.  I was a little disappointed with the edited tracks in songs containing f**k and s**t.  While I'm not a fan of the words and don't miss hearing them, if an artist develops the songs with them, the listener has the right to purchase a marketed album containing them.  Otherwise, the album should be advertised as such. <br /> <br />I was concerned the entire album would be like Track 1 (Girlfried), however, I was pleasantly surprised.  Avril's matured voice delivers a pretty solid album.  I only hope that the bubblegummy style is not overhyped.  To me it sounds that she's used some influences of The Cranberries in Track 7 (Hot) which is currently my favorite song at the moment.   <br /> <br />Overall, the CD is age appropriate for any teen.  I would encourage the purchase of most songs.
1565123875|5.0|I would recommend this book for enjoyment, and for review by your book club.  I have passed it on to friends who enjoyed it as well.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Being a huge fan of the Blue Planet series, needless to say I was stoked when I heard about Planet Earth. I set my tivo, checked it twice and patiently awaited that glorious day. The night came and like a kid watching his favorite Saturday morning cartoon, I was glued to the tv. I was immediately captivated by the unbelievable images in the opening segment...then as my brain prepared for the always entertaining,no one can do it like he does narration of the GREAT David Attenborough...I sat back in my chair in complete disbelief. WHO was this? Weaver? The actress? WHY?WHY?WHY? I quickly resigned myself to this new bit of info and decided to give her a chance (namely because the images were so incredible). As this first episode ticked by, I found myself getting madder and madder. Weaver's narration is nothing short of horrible. Her energy is non existant, she sounds like she's reading word for word and let's not even talk about how many times she mentions technology and the great risks taken to capture the images...THAT did nothing but piss me off even more! I AM interested in all the behind the scenes, but save it for the extras...PLEASE......waeving it into the narration like she does (sorry I couldn't resist) does nothing but distract and actually takes you out of the moment! Now don't get me wrong, I think she's a really good actress, but whomever decided to not have Attenborough (the GREATEST NATURE PRODUCER/NARRATOR OF OUR TIME) narrate this thing (dubbed the GREATEST NATURE PROGRAM TO DATE) should be drawn and quartered.   Well.... I tried, as the series went on, to ignore all these things but I finally turned it off half way through the 3rd night...I couldn't take it. For whatever reason, I went to the computer to see if I others felt the same as I, and sure enough, I wasn't alone. I got directed to Amazon where to my absolute disbelief, found what I'd been looking for! Turns out Attenborough DID narrate Planet Earth... for the BBC version! Needless to say, Iordered a copy right away and it arrived last night. It's EVERYTHING the Weaver version isn't. It's informative, entertaining, witty, and full of Attenborough charm....PLUS, there's NO mention of technology or risks or HD cameras or anything...just the show as it should be...all that stuff IS there (they segmented it in a seperate extra after each episode...BRILLIANT!) I can't tell you how happy I am...and if your an Attenborough fan like myself...THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Funny thing--listening to this, I wonder why Airplane doesn't have as large a following as the Dead always did. This album is such a gas! I can completely remember the first time I heard \\"She Has Funny Cars.\\" The song is the epitome of eclectic Sixties, with the rhythmic call-and-response singing, shocking drums, and psychedelic guitars.  <br /> <br />Not to say that I don't remember the other songs. I'm listening to the LP currently, and this album was, gratefully, lovingly restored to CD format. To hear Grace's powerful, liberating reverb of a voice and Marty's plaintive, beautiful cries over and over again is just a dream come true. And it's all here--crystal clear. <br /> <br />\\"Somebody to Love\\"...who has NOT heard that one? The classic \\"White Rabbit,\\" too ('hookah-smoking caterpillar...oh man, that's great stuff). Those Grace songs made the woman a standout singer of the Sixties, and the album a rightful success. But Marty's ballads shine as well, though they don't get nearly the credit they deserve. <br /> <br />Forget me talking about the music. I could do that for hours. You just need to purchase this album and relax.  <br />All of the songs on this album are simply price(and time)less. <br /> <br />Feel the love.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I only fell in love with the tv series, Firefly, about a month before Serenity was released in theatres.  Once I started watching I couldn't stop and my excitement for the film went through the roof.  I was not disappointed at all.  This film is the best adaptation for the big screen that could have been done for this show.  Yes, there are story elements that had to be let go, simply because they don't fit in a 90 minute film.  As much as I wanted this show to continue on tv for season after season, the film had the look and feel of the show.  The characters translated well to the big screen and the action was amped up to fill the giant shoes of a sci-fi action flick.  One of the big mysteries of the show is answered and in spectacular fashion, and we get to spend another hour and a half with our favorite characters.  I can only hope that the series finds new life on film or on tv or even on direct to dvd.  Any sci-fi fan cannot go wrong with Firefly and Serenity.
0064407667|5.0|This book begins the story of the three Baudelaire children.  Violet is fourteen, Klaus is twelve, and Sunny is a baby.  The author starts off by telling you that the story will not be a happy one, and he is certainly right.  The children first learn that both of their parents have died in a fire.  From there things get worse.  Their mansion is gone, leaving the children homeless as well as orphans.  Their parents' will stated that they should go to a relative living somewhere in the city, so their lives won't be disrupted too much.  After some searching, the executor of the will finds a relative--Count Olaf, who lives on the other side of the city. <br /> <br />Count Olaf is a mean and scary man, who makes the children do hard work for him all day and only gives a small room with one bed for all of them to live in.  The children are miserable living with him right from the start.  Then things get worse still.  Count Olaf is determined to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune, which Violet will inherit when she turns eighteen.  The children know that when he asks them to perform in a play with him, he is up to something.  Will they be able to figure out what it is in time to stop him from getting all of their money? <br /> <br />I love the tone of this book.  I love how the author keeps talking directly to the reader to point out that he is telling the story.  Instead of being an impersonal voice, he is another character, with a distinctive personality.   <br /> <br />The children in this story are incredibly strong.  They have lived through awful situations but they are still able to function and depend on each other, so despite the author's warnings, you never really believe they are in such trouble.
B000OHZJ9Q|5.0|The new CD from PT is everything you would expect from Steven Wilson. Bought the Limited Edition version to get the 5.1 surround mix. Excellent songs and squeaky-clean production throughout the CD. Anesthetize features Alex Lifeson (RUSH) and Way out of Here features Robert Fripp (King Crimson). Why are you still reading this review? Go get Fear of a Blank Planet and see for yourself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never watched Firefly when it originally aired, and admittedly thought the commercials for it seemed a bit strange.  A western, in space?  What could they think of next.  Then years later I happened across this little show on the Sci-Fi channel airing before Battlestar Galactica.  I watched the first episode and fell in love.  Thankfully Sci-Fi had the smarts to air the episodes in the correct order and not in the mixed up way that Fox did (which many say, and I agree, led to the downfall of the show). <br /> <br />This show is full of everything that makes great TV.  A flawed hero, superb supporting characters, cool ships, great dialogue, and action that serves the story and is not just gratuitous.  Firefly is  show that transcends traditional genre television.  The stories and characters themselves drive the drama and the setting is just a bonus for this sci-fi fan.  Anyone looking for an entertaining series should start right here with Firefly.
0345494768|5.0|Finally, a Star Wars book that truly captures in very specific detail the struggles that Lucas and crew went through during the filming of Star Wars in the mid 70s.  This book is truly a labor of love by Rinzler in the same way that Star Wars was for Lucas, which is evident by the sheer volume of information that will give you new insight into just how difficult, often frustrating, and risky it was to make this landmark and extremely influential film that struck a chord with an entire generation.
1401902197|5.0|In my opinion, everything that Louise Hay has written has been wonderful. Her very simplistic and down to earth writing really works for me. Since 1988, I have read Louise's books and listened to her tapes and CD's. When I first listened to this CD and read the book, I was amazed. This CD/Book set gives you practical help in everyday living and letting go of negative thoughts and old beliefs.

1594200106|5.0|A good book that I like (37 year old female), gave to my mother-in-law as well as my younger sister. Extremely well written and hard to put down. I opted for the hard cover when I saw what a good deal it was on-line.
0786930640|3.0|This is the first dragonlance book I have read though I do read a fair amount of fantasy.  Having finished the book last night I have to say that while the book was entertaining, I don't really anticipate that I'll continue this series to its subsequent novels.  I did want to give it a fair chance though so I finished book one.  Here are my pros and cons: <br /> <br />Pro: Good characterization - The personality traits of each of the main characters were well-developed and consistent throughout the book, making at least the characters believable as individuals.  I tend to favor character-centric stories so this resonated with me.  Tas the kender and Fizban the mage were particularly amusing and added to the book's entertainment value. <br /> <br />Simple prose - This one is a two-edged sword.  On the one hand I wasn't having to go back and re-read sentences that threw me or included details that were difficult to understand on a first pass, but on the other hand it was often too simplistic, having the feeling of a children's story or at best, young adult. <br /> <br />Cons:  Not a lot of plot - It did just seem as though the companions travelled from place to place and encountered different people and things, both good and bad.  There wasn't really a sense of growing action and the climax, while there was one was, well, fairly anti-climactic.   <br /> <br />Lack of Tension - I never got the feeling that any of the companions were in any real danger.  You always knew that whatever it was, they'd get out of it somehow, even if quite ubelievably.  The lack of tension made the book play out softly. <br /> <br />Lack of Grit/realism - The book was entertaining but on a different level from those that I generally consider really good reads.  This book was to books like GRRM's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series what Teenage mutant ninja turtles cartoons are to the Sopranos.  It's entertaining, but you won't get lost in it. You'll never feel like you \\"know\\" the characters or take part in their lives and you certainly never vest yourself into \\"feeling\\" what they feel.  It just doesn't engage on that level.  It just wasn't believable. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the book is more of a fairy tale than a fantasy and almost seems geared to a younger audience than one may be led to believe.  On the other hand, it's rated very highly and has been a bestselling series for a long time now, so take from this what you will.  It's entertaining, but I've certainly read much much better.
B000O178BY|5.0|Finally the piece of sheer brilliance that we all hoped that With Teeth be. After all this time we have waited, and in many cases given up.  Many, including myself thought With Teeth, while different from previous works was undoubtedly the new sound of NIN.  Looking back now, I cant believe I thought that was a good thing.  Now, just less than two years later comes Year Zero, and right off the bat with \\"Hyperpower!\\" you can tell things are going to be very different, and its a good kind of different.  This album is best listened to from beginning to end.  The songs just flow together perfectly.  Taking it back to the days of Pretty Hate Machine,  Trent does more with electronics and mixing than his last two works.  The album, is smart, gripping, organized and each song is wonderfully constructed.  It is less heavy than other works, but In Trents case, I think this is a good thing...many of the heavier music from other albums were great in their own right, but tended to sound noisy, cluttered and lyrically vauge.  I think Trent has struck a new chord with his deep rooted talent by doing all of what he knows best.  Without question this is far better than With Teeth, and I would say The Fragile, however being that The Fragile is a two CD set, this one isnt quite there, but if part 2 of Year Zero is as good as the first, it will be in my opinion, the best Trent Reznor has ever produced.   Get this album, and listen to it twice all the way through, it gets in your head, and you will want more of it.  It gets better and better the more you listen.  Needless to say, its been a long seven and a half years.

B000O75F7C|5.0|I have only been following this truly unique band since the release of `In Absentia', and have since then additionally purchased the albums `Stupid Dream', `Deadwing' and now, `Fear of a Blank Planet' (So that you know that my experience and knowledge of this band is limited, and this album will be judged on my experiences I have received from those albums.) I was largely unsure of what to expect from this ever shifting band. I simply cannot get enough of `Stupid Dream' and `In Absentia', but `Deadwing' was somewhat of a disappointment to me, turning away slightly from the Floyd-esque atmospheric prog to a more four-minute-song-pop-metal approach (I mean come on... no one can argue that the song `Halo' was anything but a pop song). My fear of Porcupine Tree continuing in such a direction was, fortunately, completely unwarranted.<br /><br />`Fear of a Blank Planet' is an absolutely intoxicating piece of atmospheric brilliance, surpassing  the brilliance even of `Stupid Dream'. The short song approach is completely discarded, replaced with only six tracks ranging mostly at the seven-minute mark, and one at seventeen. The upbeat pop flavor of `Deadwing' is thankfully watered down, only showing up for brief moments saving us from becoming too drenched in this album's aural sedative. Ironically due to `Fear of a Blank Planets' atmospheric focus, more metal has added to the mix (or rather, made heavier. There has always been metal, particularly in later PT releases, but the metal is distinctively more heavy in this one).  Fear not for you fans of Porcupine Tree's synth suffocated atmospherics, the more apparent metal influence adds some delightful contrast, and generally works very well with the synth washes, only overpowering them when absolutely necessary. This album is dangerously hypnotic, and Porcupine Tree seem to realize this by the addition, or rather, expansion of various elements to keep us on our feet.<br /><br />The opening track, `Fear of a Blank Planet' is similar to most of the songs on `Deadwing', and therefore, the most `normal' song on this album. It eventually does break into some ambience towards the end though and builds into `My Ashes'. `My Ashes' is an absolutely beautiful piece, that seems to expand and breathe into a living entity. Absolutely intoxicating and beautiful, largely devoid of any metal riffage. `Anesthetize' is my favorite track, timing in at a progtastic seventeen minutes. The song begins by continuing the ambient, synth rich atmosphere that My Ashes delved in, to break into some Opeth-esque metal riff experimentation towards the mid-section. Soon the song builds into an absolutely beautiful climax of synth-drenched atmosphere, and returns to another absolutely vicious metal onslaught, ending with an almost jazzish vibe. This song is absolutely all over the map and extremely well written, making for a wonderful centerpiece. `Sentimental' begins with a minimalist piano melody, accompanied by a hypnotizing vocal harmony, and expands into an absolutely consuming, gentle atmosphere. This song remains largely the same, but is executed with such a keen ear to melody and very subtle experimentation, that it becomes one of the more emotional tracks on this album. `Way Out There' begins with a very subtle and dark synth arrangement that unmistakably reminds me of the Cure in their prime. `Way Out There' is a very dark and incredibly emotional piece throughout, that weaves in and out of walls of mourning distorted guitars and all-consuming synths. Around the four-minute mark, everything falls away except for a beautifully creepy key melody that foreshadows a forthcoming heavy part, that does not disappoint. The song finally ends in beautiful semi-ambience.  `Sleep Together' begins with a very haunting bit of electronica, that goes into a slow metal riff, that later is very nicely laced with a string arrangement. This particular track remains slow, dark, and brooding, almost brings Nine Inch Nails to mind.Around the four minute mark, everything dissipates except for the electronica sample that has been in effect since the beginning of the song, that begins to duel with some very haunting string and key arrangements until almost the six minute mark where the bass finally drops in, and the climax begins, and fades out.<br /><br />Overall, `Fear of a Blank Planet' is an amazingly captivating release, combining the best elements of all Porcupine Tree, and making for very possibly the best album we will see in the grand ol' year of 2007.ur minute mark, everything dissipates except for the electronica sample that has been in effect since the beginning of the song, that begins to duel with some very haunting string and key arrangements until almost the six minute mark where the bass finally drops in, and the climax begins, and fades out.

B000O178BY|2.0|Nine Inch Nails have always been a rather interesting machine, attracting firm fans from many ends of the musical spectrum. From the music intellectuals to the pop radio masses, Nine Inch Nails have sparked an interest in many a music lover's soul. So how does the new album fare with standards that Trent Reznor has set for the Nails? Not as well as most will admit, unfortunately. Trent has simply put the bar too high with his past success (particularly with the Nails' creative apex, known as `The Fragile') for me to be satisfied with mere mediocrity.<br /><br />As most have pointed out, the dark tone has been erased from the Nine Inch Nails formula at worst, and drastically watered down at best. Unfortunately, this dark, brooding quality is what really gave Nine Inch Nails its depth and inspiration. The layered samples, the complex arrangements have largely been replaced with stadium anthems similar to that of the late Marilyn Manson. Consequently if you are a Manson fan, you might be pleasantly surprised, but for those of you who are expecting a masterpiece, I hate to inform you of your due disappointment.<br /><br />There is a lot of experimentation scattered throughout `Year Zero', and experimental music being my specialty, this could be the very element that saved `Year Zero' from mediocrity, if only the experiment had been executed with more substance. The odd samples are painfully cut-and-pasted throughout the album. As you recall in `The Fragile', all forms of experimentation were part of the main song structure that built up and formed something truly challenging and beautiful. In `Year Zero', the experimentation stands, for the most part, painfully alone, acting simply as filler between the `normal songs', unfortunately adding nothing to the overall experience.<br /><br />Not all is lost however; when `Year Zero' finally gets around to the track `My Violent Heart' things begin to get slightly better. You finally hear that bite that Reznor has largely lacked throughout the album in this song. Unfortunately things go right back to mediocre in the largely  tastelessly experimental `The Warning'. The next track, `God Given' graciously picks up where `My Violent Heart' left off and makes for the second best song on the album. You once again get a taste of the old Nails that we use to know. If Trent would've focused on the style in which he wrote these two songs, and cut down on the aimless experimentation, he surely would've ended up with a stellar release. Unfortunately this is not the case, and we end up with an overall product better than the disaster that was `With Teeth', but nowhere near the genius of `The Fragile' or `The Downward Spiral.'<br /><br />Maybe the fact is that Reznor NEEDS four years to create a masterpiece... Overall a largely disappointing release from a band that I know is capable of so much better.in this song.

B000N4SHPS|3.0|Well, compared to the tragedy that was ROCKY IV and V, ROCKY BALBOA plays like an Oscar winner all over again!  But I suppose \\"all over again\\" are the key words here. <br /> <br />When watching ROCKY BALBOA, you can't help but enjoy it as a guilty pleasure because it reminds you so much of the original ROCKY of 1976, with all of its heart, soul and drama.  But the fact is, is that when it's over, you've only been reminded and taken back to the spirit of the original film \\"all over again\\".  If that's all the sixth installment of this franchise has to offer, then you're better off watching the original best picture of 1976 all over again; it was the best film in the series and it always will be.
B000060OFT|3.0|Truly an amazing cinematic experience, this flick totally flies out of the box by sticking to the original Old English dialogue while still maintaining the portrayal of a modern setting. Every actor gives an impressive performance and each shows their understanding of the Old English dialogue they use to express themselves. In fact, I gained a greater understanding of some of Shakespeare's terminology by the inflection and timing the actors used to speak the playwrite's words. Well worth the watch. An impressive piece of cinema.
0920668372|2.0|Hi all <br />When I say it shard to feel what it really means is at the beginning the book is lovely but when it comes to the part of the mom going into her sons bedroom late and this is when hes  above adolencence and holding him for one  its not greatly thought out about a woman picking up such a heavy person and rocking them in there sleep. But I more of found the pictures a bit uncomfortable to deal with. It was a little creepy I will admit with another reviewer. I enjoyed the beginning and the end. But makes you wonder cause mother did that to him how horribly wrong it would be for that father to be doing the same thing to his daughter at thoes ages. I know its innocent but its a wrong thought. <br /> <br />Remove the middle of mother  rocking her son who  can be like in his 20's in bed and later in life you would have a much better book. Or maybe at thoes stages instead of having it rocking them in there sleep maybe sining it on the phone or at the bedroom door would of been much more acceptable in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Read the book 2 times to son and put it away. Not a book I feel comfortable reading.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|This is for people who  enjoy REAL music that has a BAND and not all artificial.  <br /> <br />This album is Avril. You hear the music, the instruments. There is no  immitation filler. When listening to this you can almost feel you are watching a live band. What did people expect when she left and came back? She didn't reinvent herself into something she ain't. She is raw to the core and use real instruments.  <br /> <br />The album has a good beat that continues throughout the CD. I agree Boy friend is the more pop of the album but the rest is what Avril has always done.  <br /> <br />I do like certain songs on the album and not so great on others but give me an album that i enjoy every single on there is a rare treat.  <br /> <br />But I applaud Avril for staying true to herself. Allowing us to see growing up doesn't mean having to turn stuffy, whorish or dead. <br /> <br />I rather see Avril any day  act out a girlfriend in school age then watching Gwen lead a biotch party in a high school when she is in her 30'ish. <br /> <br />To all the fans of Avril and true music fans who don't appreciate fake music this is a good album for you.
B0000004V2|5.0|Unbelievably brilliant, well ahead of it's time!  I can't get Waterfall out of my head.  I'm only sorry that I didn't clue into this band when they made this album but I don't think I would have been mature enough to appreciate it's brilliance.  Rarely in the history of music do collaborative artists produce such magic together squire/brown have made a masterpiece.  It's shocking that they didn't produce much more material together, but I can think of 100's of bands that have 10's of albums out and not one of them equal this.  John Squire's guitar and Brown's vocal are a match made in heaven.  If the legacy of The Stone Roses is this and very little else then so be it, at least they went out on a figurative and no doubt literal high.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This whole trilogy reads to me as a tale of despondency among the political classes in Britain. In the first act, \\"House of Cards\\", the Conservative, but still somewhat moderate, Prime Minister, get railroaded by his total over trusting of FU, or as Ronald Reagan would call it, trusting without verifying. In the second act, \\"To Play the King\\", as FU crushes the British welfare state, the King and the opposition leaders enter the political arena with high hopes, only to be dashed by the simple fact that the game is fixed in favor of Urquhart from the very beginning. In these two acts, no one in a position of real power is ever killed -- just whichever members of the lower classes who happens to come in FU's way. In the last act, \\"The Final Cut\\", it would appear that Urquhart's various crimes may have finally caught up with him-- his crimes as a solider in Cyprus, his crimes during the previous two acts, and his reckless war, again in Cyprus, as PM -- but the game is still rigged, as FU's wife and chief assistant plan a merciless assassination of Urquhart, preventing him from facing courtroom justice.  The only possible hope left for the country is Corder's apparent decision to let the appropriately named Tom Makepeace be Prime Minister. This series is so wonderfully depressing and it rings unbearably true. <br /> <br />A minor note: For those of you with region-free and PAL compatible DVD players, the Region 2 edition of this set, available at Amazon.co.uk, is preferred, as it apparently has cast & crew commentary on some of the episodes.
B00006AW2P|5.0|As time passed by, my sense that this and \\"Out of Our Heads\\" were their finest efforts never really left me.  Not to say that enormous chunks of wonderful stuff didn't follow, of course, unlike many bands who peaked on their early releases and never challenged again.  I just loved the raw passion in the way they covered material like \\"Not Fade Away\\" \\"Hitch Hike\\" and \\"Walking the Dog,\\" and made it their own. To me, these well chosen covers were much more appealing than some of the later \\"middle of the LP\\" songs from their own writing. And, as for \\"Tell Me,\\" it just doesn't get much better than that!
B00011D1RC|5.0|This film holds up quite well after nearly 75 years, and after watching the first 1/2 hour, you'll know why: timeless acting, a literate sceenplay and beautiful b/w cinematography.  The ensemble acting is terrific with many great nuanced performances, with no one performance *stealing* the film but gaining poignancy from playing off one another. The screenplay seems to have been written by someone who has known life, especially life among the rich and famous, and the film has enough depictions of the suffering rich to make F.Scott Fitzgerald proud. There are many famous lines which you will recognize, including the famous, *I vant to be alone* by Greta Garbo.  <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite golden age films, and you can't say you know films without seeing it at least once.
B000O178BY|5.0|As many have said before, this album is Trent's return to what he does best. It's one of, if not the best album NIN has put out. Ever. It's a strange mix of \\"musical noise\\" and angst driven lyrics. It's so stunning it completely blows my mind.  <br /> <br />It's vastly different than With Teeth to many's delight. I enjoyed With Teeth because it was a masterpiece in it's own right, but it doesn't hold a candle to Year Zero.  <br /> <br />I'm a little worried about Trent's next album. How can he top Year Zero? We'll just have to see how things unfold, but until then, grab your copy of Year Zero to sate your NIN appetite.

1582701709|1.0|Firstly let me state from the start that I do believe that thoughts create a large part of our reality. Not all of it, but a 'certain' amount. I think the limitation to creating what we need is our limiting beliefs so NO amount of visualisation, thoughts of attraction and good intention will bring to you what you desire if deep down, somewhere in your unconscious is a belief waiting to capsize your intention. We all need to dig deeper and spend some time reflecting on why we may not succeed despite all the \\"attractive\\" thoughts we throw at it. Root those out, convert them to your way of thinking and you can create. Just remember you are not manifesting something out of thin air but clearing ( good word) the path to them.<br /><br />This book has all the trappings of either a new convert (wild claims, exclamation marks and little substance) or a con job, (wild claims, exclamation marks and little substance).<br /><br />If it was a regular size book with regular print size, without the large gaps between the repetitive and sometimes nonsense quotes you would have a very thin publication.<br /><br />However do not let this put you off following up on what I hope may have been the itention of the book; to learn about ourselves and the power we do have. There are no secrets; it's just that you have had your eyes closed.
B000NIVJEU|1.0|Eragon is the work of a clever young writer (a boy of 15) who decided sometime before 2002 to write his book about a female Dragon. But, totally forgot about originality because he decided to make the theme of his book about Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />A 15 year old boy named Eragon (Edward Speleers,lives with his Uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong)and his cousin Roran (Chris Egan). They all live on a farm near the small village of Carvahall. Eragon, while hunting through the forest finds a blue stone--which is teleported by a witch named Angela, who is being chased by Durza (Robert Carlyle). Later on, he decides to take the stone to the village of Carvahall to sell it to a local buyer (pawn shop) but, instead he turns him down. As he leaves, he notices the village storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons) and he is very curious about the stories that he has heard about the legendary Dragon Riders from the past. Afterwards, he goes back to the farm and soon discovers that the blue stone is an egg. He witnesses the birth of a baby dragon Saphira (Rachel Weisz, the voice of the dragon) and within a short time develops a bond with this creature. But, King Galbatorix, John Malkovich(who was a former Dragon Rider but, turned rogue) learns of the hatching and dispatches the Ra'zac who are creatures that look like mummies. They are flying when suddenly Eragon notices that something has happen on his Uncle Garrow's farm but arrives to late and fines his uncle dead. Brom soon finds out and joins up with Eragon and Saphira and tells him that Eragon and Saphira are the last hope, along with the freedom fighters known as the Varden, to overthrow King Galbatorix and his evil empire. Will Young Eragon succeed?<br /><br />We wonder why Christopher Paolini couldn't get any one better to direct his book, and could it be the reason most of this movie was derived from the plot of Star Wars, trilogy (1977-1983).<br /><br />This movie is directed by first time director Stefen Fangmeier whose past film credits (which had nothing to do about directing, which obviously shows up) are visual effects work on such movies as Lemony Snicket's A series of Unfortunate Events and Master and Commander. The screen writer for this movie was Peter Buchman who is only known work has been Jurassic Park 3 (yes, you could say he's a first time writer). The biggest problem with this movie is the originality. There are many instances where his screenplay shows this; Eragon is a farm boy (Luke Skywalker), he lived with his uncle (Uncle Ben), he tries to sell the stone (that looks like a gigantic, blueberry jellybean) and this is very similar to Luke Skywalker buying R2-D2 from the Jawas. His uncle getting killed by the Ra'za this is the same as the Stormtroopers killing Luke's uncle and aunt. Brom is very much the same as Obi Wan Kenobi who was a former Jedi Knight and a protector and of the peace; much like Brom was a former Dragon Rider. When the rider and Dragon are connected together it's just like the mysterious energy that connects the Jedi Knight with the Force.<br /><br />Now, the acting, the visual effects, makeup, even the sound effects, and creature effects present a problem for this picture. The acting in this movie was not horrible, but presented itself as laughable, too serious (Jeremy Irons is the one to blame for this), and even emotionless because of the screenplay. Dragons are mystical and powerful creatures. We do not experience the supremacy of the dragon because of her female voice. The dragon's voice reminds us a lot of the Julia Roberts which was used in the recently released version of Charlotte's Web. How can we embrace this Dragon, if it does give us a sense of strength? The voice and the acting, simply fail.<br /><br />The visuals are just horrible, their special effects crew and designers took a lot of set designs from the Lord of the Rings; like the flying sequences, to the background scenery, and even to the battle sequences. One of the worse scenes in the movie is towards the end when Durza and Eragon are fighting (this is the climax of the movie), you can't see the action that is going on between the two of them because the camera is moving around to quickly for the us to appreciate the action, so this leads the audience to confusion.<br /><br />The make up and the costume design of our villains (King Galbatorix and Durza and the Urgals) were like a cheap representation of The Lord of the Rings. The Dragon which was probably the most important part of this film was not convincing at all, because it looked a cross between the Dragon from Never Ending Story and the remote control toy roboraptor.<br /><br />Lastly the sound effects were a bit overdone when Saphire flew, because she sounded like a Tie Fighter from Star Wars or even like the sound effects used in a Japanese's Godzilla/Rodan monster movie.<br /><br />Enter at your own risk because this movie is a complete rip off of Star Wars and every other fanasty fiction movie in the last 25 years.the end when Durza and Eragon are fighting (this is the climax of the movie), you can't see the action that is going on between the two of them because the camera is moving around to quickly for the us to appreciate the action, so this leads the audience to confusion.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought the sweepers using the 2 for 1 offer from [...] website, one for us and one for our parents. We have a hardwood floor kitchen with 2 kids to mess it up, and we end up scooping about half a cup of junk from floor every day. My parents love to cook and end up generating same amount of garbage on the floor.      Ever since we bought the swivel sweepers, our floors have been decently clean. The sweeper does a decent job, and is extremely light - many times, my kids, as soon as they spill something on the floor, clean the mess by themselves. We also have a extra heavy marble top dining table and moving it to clean was out of question - the sweeper goes under it and cleans the rug thoroughly.      My sweeper came with a bad battery - after 1 use, it would not charge. I called SwivelSweeper support, and a new battery was shipped immediately - no questions asked. The rep was courteous enough to offer me a charger also, but I declined as I believed the problem was with the battery, not charger.      My advise to users is to empty the cup immediately - the cup is small, and when you turn it upside down with a full cup, many times, the contents came out. In addition, I have experienced spillage when I go from hardwood floor to rugs. Moreover, it is hygenic too, to empty it.     So folks with difficult-to-maintain hardwood / tile floors, give your backs a break and buy this. This will be a great investment. Keep in mind that this is not supposed to replace your normal high-powered vacuum; this is a very delicate vacuum, and I doubt if the handle or sweeper head will withstand the load from vacuuming a carpet.

B000LZ53N8|5.0|I'm a hard core Muse fan, and when I first listen to  \\"Super Massive Black Hole\\"  I was confused... but the truth is this album is great, it may not sound as \\"powerful\\" as Origin Of Symmetry but has got Muse's signature all over it, the DVD is awesome, Muse is unbeatable in live performances...  <br /> <br />The CD is kind of expensive though, but the extra track \\"Glorious\\" is simply... GLORIOUS! Buy this item if you are a fan, it's really worth it.
B000O75F7C|5.0|An amazing, beautiful album speaking on behalf of a disconnected, apathetic generation. Amazing drumming and melody. Buy it!<br /><br />Also check out Blackfield, Steven Wilson's pop-rock side project with Israeli Aviv Geffen - Blackfield II is another beautiful piece of work. [[ASIN:B000MR9ESA Blackfield II]]
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most amazing wildlife program I've ever seen!  The angles and timelapse video are so engaging.  The scenes are unique and keep you interested through the whole program.
0060977493|1.0|I've tried on several occasions to read this and just couldn't get through. I found it slow and tedious, and just couldn't get invested in the characters or the plot (whatever the plot was, since it didn't really seem like there was one). After reading all these great reviews though, I must be missing something...
6304806418|5.0|Evita is the best contemporary historical musical out there. Madonna shines in this film, as does Antonio Bandaraz. Anyone who doesn't appreciate Evita, obviously doesn't know their history.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the DVD has NO extra features! There really is no point in purchasing the DVD over the VHS unless you want to be able to flip through the chapters or care about wide screen. I would have liked to see some director's commentary as well as an interview with Madonna. Some historical notes would have been nice too.
B000008GS9|5.0|He took a much edgy, more hard rock path with this album. It's more along the lines of \\"Blue Highway,\\" than any other songs before it. Less punk and more hard rock. His cover of \\"L.A. Woman\\" is worth buying this cd for.This is hands down my favorite Billy Idol record. Every song is memorable with great melodies and excellent lyrics. This was a perfect match between music and lyrics. More originality, more raw, and less pop and overproduced. It's great to hear this album because none of the songs are overplayed like \\"Mony Mony\\" and \\"Rebel Yell\\" on the other albums. Songs are alot deeper and unexplored such as \\"The Loveless,\\" \\"Sweet Stuff,\\" \\"Prodigal Blues,\\" and \\"Cradle of Love.\\" Definitely his most underappreciated and overlooked albums. Probably because it was ahead of it's time.
0446364495|1.0|I read this book many years ago, right after came out...was excited to read a book so many raved about and in my many years of reading novels, this is the first I ever stopped reading because I was disgusted by what felt like a manipulation by author to capture the fancy of women who dreamed of having a romantic affair.....so I gave to a woman who actually lived out this fantasy (very sordid & destructive to a whole family) and she thought it was a wonderful book!!  Go figure!!
B000N4SADM|5.0|I just got this disc today and I love it. I recently caught Hiromi and the band at the Blue Note in New York and they played selections from this disc and it worked live as well. I wish I had gotten the CD before I saw them but it really doesn't matter. The addition of guitarist Dave ' Fuze' Fiuczynski was a great move by Hiromi. He brings another dimension to the band and his playing is tasteful throughout. He and Hiromi nail it down. Bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihora are superb. I am especially impressed with Martin. He is fairly new to me but his playing is very impressive.<br /><br />If you're looking for a traditional jazz CD, this isn't it. Hiromi continues to mix in electronic keys and does so very nicely. The fusion element is present throughout and since I'm a fusion head, it works for me. All in all a very well put together disc. I know Hiromi has been getting quite a bit of hype lately and that may turn some people off and they may not see what all the fuss is about. I could care less as I don't pay much attention to that stuff. I have always let my ears be the judge and that's worked pretty good for me thru the years. Hype or no hype, I like what Hiromi is doing, period!<br /><br />[...]
B00005JPO8|4.0|The Lives of Others is a great movie. However, it is not a masterpiece. On the plus side, the director has a total command of the medium, he knows how to make a suspenseful, thoughtful, entertaining movie, that holds the interest of the audience even at a running time that exceeds 2 hours. What's more, the acting is uniformly great. Let's talk now about the main reason why I can't give the movie a five stars rating. The emotional heart of the movie is when the Stasi officer in charge of spying the playwright and his girlfriend, a very tough and experienced individual who presumably has worked in many similar cases before, decides instead to protect them. Why he would do that, risking an end to his career and even a charge of treason?. Though his motivations are not altogether clear (he is an extremely reserved man), the change of heart seems to happen in part as a result of listening to the playwright play a sonata on the piano after learning one of his colleagues committed suicide, after years of harassment by the government (he is also uneasy after finding out the Stasi is going for the playwright not for ideological reasons but in order that his beautiful girlfriend would then be available for the repellent minister of culture). As a metaphor from his newly found sensibility, he even steals a book from Brecht from the playwright's house, and is seen reading it. Is this believable? As much as the audience would be moved by a story of redemption, I think it's not. This is not a minor quibble, since this change of heart is really the main plot twist of the movie, on which all the film is build. From what I know, few if any Stasi officers have expressed any remorse from what they did, and continue to defend their actions. That aside, this is a great film, from a young director that really knows how to make a movie that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking. And it has many great scenes that you vividly remember later. The best one: the young Stasi officermaking a ill-timed Honecker joke in the cafeteria. It's a scene that's so good on so many levels.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I disagree, the Colin Firth film was way better. This new film was just a rushed version of the old one. And it did not have nearly the suspense or holding of breath.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|I had been watching this program on Discovery Channel in HD and this program was AMAZING! However, I just received the DVD today and this version for standard DVD is HORRIBLE compared to what I was watching on HD. Perhaps I'm biased, but the quality seems even worse than regular television. I'm going to send this back and buy the HD version and see if that's any better. Bottom line: don't buy this DVD. Find out if the HD is better, and if so, buy that one.
B00005JIWZ|5.0|Must have for collectors, especially if you miss the old album covers. I believe (if I'm not mistaken) it is packaged exactly like the original LP with glossy cardboard cover and artwork on front and back and opens to a double spread with inside artwork. Really awesome little miniature. In my opinion, definitely worth the extra few bucks.
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|This album marks the beginning of the end for Jethro Tull. Not because the band is going downhill on its own, but because Ian is driving it that way forcibly. <br /> <br />Here is where Ian starts to replace the top-notch, virtuostic players that have always made Tull the most musical band on the face of the planet, with people like his son, James Duncan Anderson, who, forgive me for being blunt, is a hack percussionist and utterly incapable at the throne. <br /> <br />Now he has replaced just about everyone else (except Martin) with second rate musicians that just can't play at the level which his compositions demand. And why? to save a buck. So Ian Anderson can die a rich man. <br /> <br />Tosh. This album is not bad, there's some really great playing, great fun arrangements of traditional tunes, but, there are a few spots where you wince at James' playing ability... and there will be a lot more of that if this new concert lineup stays. We're going to begin to miss Doane, Andrew and John. <br />
0684800713|1.0|This is a terrible book. Never read it for the following reasons: <br /> <br />1. It is BORING. All the characters do in the novel is get drunk and have sex. If I wanted to read a book filled with nothing but that, I'd pick up my copy of \\"I Hope they Serve Beer in Hell\\" by Tucker Max, thank you. <br /> <br />2. The love scenes are amorous and unrealistic. At one point in the book, Brett tells Jake that love is \\"hell on earth\\". <br /> <br />3. This book, along with almost all of Hemingway's books, is about himself. If Hemingway was an interesting person that would be all right but he's not. He should have just taken all of his novels and made them into one big autobiography. It would have saved many high school students like myself who have are assigned his crap in English a lot of misery. <br /> <br />4. He is not that great of a writer. His style is short, simple, with not a lot of difficult vocabulary. Because of his style, his characters are two-dimensional and dull. <br /> <br />This supposed masterpiece helped establish Ernest Hemingway as the most overhyped writer of the 20th century. If there is anything rewarding about  this novel, it is that you can finish it real fast and get this self-indulgent drivel over with.
B0002DB52M|3.0|Beautiful and mysterious stranger Grace runs from the gangsters and arrives to the tiny town Dogville that sits somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. The first man she meets, Tom Edison (Paul Bethany), writer/philosopher (who has not written anything yet) decides to help her and introduces her to town folks. Hard-working and decent residents of Dogville reluctantly agree to let Grace stay in the exchange for some menial services. When the residents find out that she may be wanted by the law for the bank robberies, they demand more of her services and eventually make her their slave. Friendly and honest people turn into the sadistic monsters indulging their vile instincts and enjoying the strongest drug possible - absolute power over a helpless human being.<br /><br />Dodgeville's visual style comes directly from the 50th TV dramas - minimum decorations, just a few actors, and a lot of text. There are no real houses or mountains on the screen - the main street, the benches, the bushes, the houses of the residents are marked out with a chalk outlines on the stage. We see some chairs, beds, and desks. There are no walls or doors to cover what happens behind them - all is opened for us to see. Director's craft is fantastic - you soon forget unreality of the sets - impressiveness of close-ups, usage of light and different angles are fantastic. Several film's images should be studied in the film schools. One of them is the shot of Grace trying escape Dogville and hiding in the truck full of apples. She thinks she is covered and safe and nobody could see her...Another - shot when the light lit her face and it radiates in a gentle gold - brings to memory the famous candle lit scenes from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. The actors are all amazing and they are another reason to forget about the unconventional set. Nicole Kidman played the best role of her career and I have to admit that waiting for so long to see her in this performance was worth it.<br /><br />With all this said I couldn't accept Lars von Trier's \\"Dogville\\" as his masterpiece. He may be a genius but an evil genius. He is a cold and calculating master of provocations. Each frame of Dogville is a masterpiece and I am ready to admire and applaud to every one of them. Unfortunately, put together they contain nothing but misanthropy, hatred and contempt for all humans with only one exception - Mr. Von Trier himself. I kept asking myself while watching Dogville why he hates us? Not just the town folks of Dogville and not only America but the whole human race. What is it, genuine pain or the evil laugh in which we hear that we all deserve our Hell?<br /><br />Von Trier is a brilliant director, \\"Dogville\\" is a phenomenal film but I just cannot agree with his depiction of all residents. There were children (one of them just an innocent infant who could not be hold responsible for the sins of his parents) and a crippled, helpless girl.<br /><br />This is not the first von Trier's film I've seen. His \\"Breaking the Waves\\" and \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" are very difficult to watch. They, too, deal with humiliated and tortured innocence but there was hope in those two films. The heroines went through unthinkable trials and tribulations but there was light in the end, catharsis. There is no catharsis in \\"Dogville\\" - bitterness, hopelessness, despair, anger, and the question to the writer/director -who are you to judge? You are the one who came up with all these monsters in the first place.<br /><br />I understand the whole story is an allegory of power and how easily it turns seemingly decent people into monsters. As Lord Acton said \\"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" but I simply refuse to accept von Trier's message that the whole world MAY BE Dogville. I refuse to believe that an outsider in a desperate need of help will be treated by ALL with no exception members of a tight community in such way the citizens of Dogville treated Grace.<br /><br />Directing and acting - 5/5 ; message 1/5ecting and acting - 5/5 ; message 1/5  <br /> <br />
0307120007|3.0|My three year old still reads his copy that he got when he was a baby.  My second baby received one when she was 8 months and also loves it.  I just wish they were more sturdy.  It's a wonderful book but my kids are a bit rough and have torn it to shreds.  They have other touch and feel/lift the flap books that are much more sturdy.  I think they should keep the storyline but re-design the construction.
6305127646|4.0|I loved this movie.  It is not complete fantasy though, Val Kilmer's character is not your average untouchable action hero.  He does make mistakes.  He is one of the world's top thieves and is also a master of disguise, but this causes trouble for him early in the movie.  He steals a cold fusion formula from a scientist played by Elisabeth Shue and has to choose stealing the formula over his love for Shue.  He has to steal the formula because she would be hunted down if a humane person like Kilmer didn't steal it.  After he sells it to the Russians they find the formula incomplete and he has to give them the missing link before they kill him.  He also has to save Elisabeth Shue since they are back after her.  There is much more going on in the movie and it is one wild ride!<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />The DVD from Paramount has good picture and sound quality.  There is a director's commentary.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I figured I would watch this movie on a Lark...We all know the jokes about rocky and infinite sequels.  <br /> <br />The days leading up before I saw the movie, I would chant \\"Rocky, Rocky\\" to my girlfriend (not a fan).  I was all but prepared for the comic spoofs I was going to make afterward...but then something happened.  <br /> <br />As I watched the movie all jokes feel aside when I realized that this was the best Rocky ever! There was a depth and maturity to this movie, probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years. There was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture. One can almost see themselves in Philly, going up to Rocky and shaking his hand. This character is that real. <br /> <br />When you watch this final installment, you will realize why you originally were drawn to the Rocky movies and character 30 years ago. Rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit. And he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans. <br /> <br />Check out this Movie. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000ION23A|5.0|Im a big 3d fan and this movie has a lots of details and a magnific animation applied to the characters, totally recommended
0701180382|5.0|It's surprising - to me anyway - that I am the first customer to review this book. I bought it because I am interested in cross-cultural understanding, and hoped I would gain some insights. Having read it - and gained more insights than I could have dreamed of - I assumed everyone in the world must have read it by now, and many would have hastened to review it here.<br /><br />Xiaolu Guo (call her \\"Z,\\" most people in the book do) is a young woman who arrives in London from China to complete a course in English.<br /><br />Her story, each chapter of which is based on an English word, is just fascinating. At a fairly early stage she begins a relationship with an Englishman, and their mutual struggle to find a deep bond, (well, to find love I suppose), is painful, endearing, frustrating and at times hilarious.<br /><br />Xiaolu's commentary on English customs, cuisine and quirks is genuinely profound. As a Westerner, I found it hugely helpful in my battle to understand the differences between the West and China; I recommend it highly to people planning a visit to China, or planning serious dealings with Chinese.<br /><br />Of course I wonder how much of it is autobiographical, and my guess is \\"most\\" - in which case Xiaolu is a powerful, brilliant and very funny woman. But even if it is predominantly fiction, it is a great read.<br /><br />Some may be put off by the writing style - \\"deliberately bad English\\" - but I think this is one of the strengths of the book. It certainly enhances its authenticity.<br /><br />In this review I have focused on the educational value of the book, and perhaps even its value as a travel narrative (her trip through Europe is a novella in its own right).<br /><br />But for those who would like to read a great, funny, and at times very erotic novel - you won't be disappointed either.
B00000AOUD|5.0|a Jethro Tull fanatic, but I am an old time rocker and I love both Thick as a Brick and Aqualung, and never get tired of putting either in my player and reveling in the past.  The other reviewers have done a great job commenting on the arrangements, the musicianship, the lyrics, etc. so I won't attempt to add anything.  My point is that there are any number of musicians who write a song or two or even three spoofing the life and times of a rock and roller, e.g. Joe Walsh's \\"Life's Been Good\\" and John Entwhistle's \\"Success Story\\", but a whole record spoofing the genre, i.e. the \\"concept\\" album, in a rather subtle way was and still is remarkable.  I can remember the rock critics of those days desperately trying to discern the message when the message ultimately is, no more and no less, just great music.  So, buy it, play it, and just plain enjoy it for what it is.
B00000K19E|5.0|Over the years since its release, I've racked my brain for SF concomitants or analogs, shared themes that might have formed the basis for this film. I look everywhere, search thousands of SF films watched, all the late night B horror and cheesy SF I watched as a kid, even back into the annals of The Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Nothing. I find no exact matches. I find minor archetypes sure, even one or two broad but thin ones, but no real conceptual basis between what came before and this film. I get the broad \\"computer-wants-to-destroy humanity\\" theme a couple of times, notably the progenitor of the notion in \\"The Forbin Project\\". The \\"Terminator\\" series shares the concept as well. But it's that nasty little \\"use-the-humans-as-batteries\\" idea that throws you. Add to that unprecedented originality the perfect storyline and dialog to bring it to you and you're almost there. Layer on the cinematic beauty of the film itself and the remarkable special effects and you have a one-of-a-kind work of art. Don't forget the characters, rich and fully defined. Even the antagonists, though computer generated entities, have a surprisingly all-to-human side. Agent Smith: \\"I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.\\" Classic. That's a far cry from HAL 9000. No comparison.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|<br />I can't yet say Craig is better than Connery, but he definitely holds his own with this movie.  I was taking my time on seeing this movie, but word of mouth eventually led me to get it and boy was I wrong about waiting! The first 10 minutes alone will have you on the edge of your seat! This was easily one of the best action movies I have watched in a long time.  My wife, who generally falls asleep watching movies and doesn't care much for action movies loved it.  There was more of a love story than you would expect from a Bond movie as another reviewer noticed, and it is a departure from what a Bond lover would expect, but I liked the storyline and it isn't \\"chick flick\\"ish, so it's no big deal.  Whoever were the writers did an excellent job - it did not seem put together just to make money from a big franchise name that is James Bond.  The thing I found hilarious was some of the British sexual humor.  It was at times so in you face, I was dying laughing! <br /> <br />This bond is a little different than previous Bonds, though.  He has just became a \\"double O\\", so the movie shows the bond character more raw and less refined than other bond movies (as I guess you would expect for someone who's new to being a double O), but it is very convincing in this movie and I don't think it would have been as entertaining had he been more \\"Bondish\\".  I watched the movie twice I liked it so much, and my wife wanted to as well (which is really saying something considering all she likes almost are \\"chick flicks\\"). <br /> <br />If you are the type that rents many movies, but only buys the best ones you would watch more than once, then you will NOT be dissapointed if you add this one to your keeper list.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner, based on the novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Phillip K. [...], is an allegory that teaches us something about the nature of our mortality. It asks the questions we all ask: \\"Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got?\\" I know it asks these exact questions because the character of ex-cop Deckard tells us so exactly in the voiceover-laden theatrical version of the film.<br /><br />In spite of the persistent flaw of the VO's, this film goes on my list of top 15 favorites nonetheless. It is a beautiful film, moody, poetic and yet suspenseful. It is an intensely human drama set in a dark and rainy future where genetically engineered humans are relinquished to roles of servitude. Disenfranchised, they are built and programmed to be prostitutes, laborers, soldiers or other grunts.  All the jobs \\"real\\" humans either can't or won't do are the rice bowls for this new generation of slaves called \\"replicants\\". Programmed into them is a biological clock that shortens their life span, making them easier to manage and very expendable. The knowledge of their shortened life span sends a small group of replicants on a quest...oh, hell, I'm telling you the storyline -- see the movie for that...  One of the many memorable things about this film is the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, a replicant so well made and supplied with memories so complete she has no idea she's one of them.<br /><br />Deckard's job is to terminate errant, runaway replicants, and when he forms a relationship with Rachael, his ambivalence, already to the point of impairing his professional judgment, is made worse. This sets the stage for the powerful transformation of Deckard later in the film, making his repentance about killing who he now perceives as real people, replicants or not, all the more moving. The end of the film has one of the most beautiful, hanky-dabbing cinematic sequences I've ever seen when Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy Batty recites in his moment of death: \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe - troop ships on fire off the...\\" Crud. I used to have that especially poetic passage memorized, but I'm afraid I'll just butcher it now.<br /><br />Strong characterizations, fascinating themes, great special effects and brilliant art direction make this one of the best SF dramas ever made. Replicants Pris and Rachael are wonderfully portrayed by Darryl Hannah and Sean Young, and Harrison Ford is spot on as the morally tortured blade runner, Deckard. The movie is filled with characters and concepts you just won't forget. If you can, see the director's cut without the VO's. It's a much better version of the film and makes one wonder why the VO's were used in the first place.ites in his moment of death: \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe - troop ships on fire off the...\\" Crud.

B000001E3M|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Van Morrison. I like some of his music and don't like some of his music. This album, however is among the greatest albums, (by anyone) that I've ever heard! The instrumental segments in most of the songs are phenominal. I first bought it on cassette tape in the nineties and wore it out listening to it. Just bought the CD set recently when I heard it was out of print. (Why did that happen, anyway?) I will love this album till the day I die!!!!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This space western does such a good job of character building it's no wonder it was so popular. The bad characters drive the action perfectly and with malicious intent and the good characters deal with the adversity brilliantly. Conceptually, most SF builds on what came before it. Serenity has no such limitations: it builds on something else. It's hard to describe why a story with so little in the way of truly original thought plays so well on all levels. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that when all the pieces come together just right, originally takes a back seat to synergy and perfect execution. You could have put the troupe of misfits in Serenity in covered wagons on the western plains and the story would have worked just as well. Convert them to pirates on the open seas and the stories would still play. Make them a band of renegade rebel soldiers and the basic plot lines would hold up with a few adjustments. I loved this film and after seeing it, immediately watched the DVDs of the series, and I was surprised by how well the feature film preserved those elements that made the series work so well - the characters - fascinating, complex, fully developed and above all, entertaining. Good characters are the basis of good drama. Brilliant drama is where you find it.

B000I2J2W2|5.0|I have owned the SD DVD edition for a while, but after reading the glowing reviews of the HD DVD version I decided to have a look. Wow! the difference between this and the washed out SD edition is amazing. That was before I found the surprise bonuses, a full version of the Invisible Boy, a movie I saw as a kid and loved.  Hours and hours of docos, heaps of trailers from classic 50's movies. Spent all day Saturday watching this one disc.  Well worth the purchase price.  The only down side is that all future purchases will be compared to this for content.
0792844882|1.0|Plan 9 From Outer Space was worse than this steaming pile, but they didn't have the lavish budget to waste that this one did.<br /><br />Every show biz cliche imaginable is dragged out, but in such a clumsy, trying-but-failing-to-be-manipulative way, that your jaw drops to the floor, and you are entertained, almost against your will. Also, there are really spectacular dance scenes, and lots of female flesh for the eyes to feast on.<br /><br />But the story and the dialogue and the direction are stupid. The red haired actor who plays the choreographer also played the Wig Master for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on an episode of Seinfeld. Kramer somehow misses seeing the show and as consolation, is allowed to walk down Broadway wearing the Tecnicolor Dreamcoat. He is then mistaken for a pimp and arrested. Perhaps that whole sequence was intended as an homage to Showgirls, and one can only wish that Joe Esterhauz could have been arrested for pimpin' this ridiculous movie.
0307236722|5.0|I've used the recipes in this book so many times and they've always turned out delicious and beautiful! I love that the range of baked goods is completely covered; from the beloved cookie to the more exotic pastries and breads.  <br /> <br />This is also great for all bakers! Beginners get a helpful guide to starting their bakeware collection and basic techniques that are beautifully illustrated. The sumptuous pictures in this cookbook is reason enough to own it and have it around the house! Most recipes can be made with ingredients that the average pantry has. If you can only get one book about baking, this is the one to get!
B000O75F7C|5.0|I was really pleased with the new material when I got to see Porcupine Tree last, and they've met my high expecations for this album.  Some longtime PT fans seem to have issues with the heavy riffs, but this is a direction they should have seen coming since In Absentia.  I honestly expected to hear more of this on Deadwing.  Someone mentioned that this album probably won't add to PT's fanbase; however, this couldn't be further from reality.  The buzz surrounding the release of FOABP goes way, way beyond that of any of the band's prior albums.  The sound is more appealing to metal fans, and this, along with the lyrical content, will cause some to say that PT is consciously playing to a younger audience.   <br /> <br />In any case, FOABP is an excellent album that contains a snapshot of PT's work as a whole and manages at the same time to progress in new directions.  I can't wait to see them again May 12.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|I pre-ordered this set and received it today.  The picture quality is terrible.  I've been watching the series on Discovery HD and was anxiously awaiting the release of the original BBC series and was not happy with the video quality.  I bought the regular DVD series, but the edges of everything were blurred together.  I watch regular DVDs and get better quality than this.  Perhaps it was a bad run of the DVD set as they might have been rushing to put it out?  I am using a progressive scan with HDMI upconversion and have a 52\\" 1080p LCD set.  Maybe I will just wait until the HD war is over and get it on the preferred format??  Any other issues like this?
B000O75F7C|3.0|After seeing them play much of the new material this last fall at their show in Hollywierd, FOABP is not quite what I was expecting, and I'm a bit disappointed with it. Pjammer85's review addressed most of my comments, so I don't need to rehash it - it's a good cd, but not on par with Deadwing, Stupid Dream, or whatever may be your favorite. I'm definately a fan and evangelist of the band, but I don't think that FOABP will take up permanent residence in my truck's cd changer like DW, or either Riverside disc.     Ok, it's now a couple weeks later than the previous paragraph, and I've listened to it half a dozen more times and it's grown on me considerably; I'll give it another star. I've also come to the conclusion that Steven has done a great job of pointing out the end result of the successful efforts of Chuck Darwin, Madeline Murray O'Hair, and Margaret Sanger! Not much left for kids to live for now is there - Might I suggest some Neal Morse?
B000NQR7NO|4.0|Arctic Monkeys are a UK phenomenon, with last year's debut album \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" selling more than any other debut album, EVER, in UK chart history. It was a great album, no question. Now, only a year later, comes the follow-up album.<br /><br />\\"Farvourite Worst Nightmare\\" (12 tracks, 37 min.) shows the band maturing. While there are still many hard charging songs, such as the lead-off track (and irresistable first single) \\"Brianstorm\\", there is a darker side to this album as well. The album is neatly divided into two 6 song cycles, recalling the good ol' vinyl album days. On the first half, in addition to the previously mentioned \\"Brianstorm\\", highlights include the urgent \\"Teddy Picker\\", the reggae-flavored \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" and the pensive \\"Only Ones Who Know\\". On the second half, my personal favorites are \\"This House Is a Circus\\", \\"If You Were There, Beware\\" (with great guitar licks,even a solo), and the closer, a misleading 'ballad' \\"505\\". In all, quite a satisfying album. I enjoyed it from start to finish and at 37 min. it clips by in no time.<br /><br />I'm still not sure I understand the UK frenzy over this. I read that the album sold close to 100,000 there on the first day of the release earlier this week. Say what? That said, Arctic Monkeys bring great music, and this album confirms it. I will see them live at Coachella this coming weekend and I can't wait to check them out live to see what the UK hype is all about.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|When I read the rave reviews of this Masterpiece Theatre [2006] adaptation of Jane Eyre, I knew I had to check it out, and I was not disapppointed. This production stays very true to the book, and the lead actors have done an excellent job of portraying the complex characters of Jane Eyre & Edward Rochester. Ruth Wilson brings a vulnerability and luminosity to Jane, and her chemistry with Toby Stephens' Rochester is altogether strong & believable. Jane Eyre has always been one of my favorite classics of literature and I am so thankful for this brilliant adaptation. The wonderful score & lush cinematography add to one's appreciation of the story.
006112429X|5.0|We Need to Talk About Kevin is a book made of day-to-day details into the lives of the Katchadourian/Plaskett family as recorded by the mother, Eva. A few readers describe these insights as \\"rambling on\\". But, I think details show the psychological tension building up around Kevin, the troubled elder child.<br /><br />I personally know people who have not finished the book, annoyed at the details that seemingly have no point. But if you are bent on psychology and every little thing that gives life its texture, you might be able to finish the book. But something happens at the end that make you understand the build-up, if you care about that.<br /><br />Female author Lionel Shriver writes in convoluted and witty sentences. These words made to come out of the mother's pen could make you dislike the character. But that some would criticize her as a mother, as a person makes me wonder in disbelief. I disliked the character of the wimp, sissy father considerably more. Eva is not an evil mother. She is very common and rather normal as a woman. Plus, I think whatever narcissistic traits she has are redeemed throughout the novel.<br /><br />Whose fault is it if Kevin turned up the way he did? The pessimistic and somewhat self-absorbed mother who did not want him at first or the dad turning on his wife so readily and closing eyes in front of the evidence about his son? Well, maybe it is nobody's fault just as in many conformist families where antisocial and delinquent kids pop up or in slow-witted families where highly intelligent children grow up like freaks of nature.<br /><br />I think this book is a feat: who could write a story of such intensity, culminating at the end with a heart-wrenching last paragraph, for over 400 pages, only made of deep psychological forays into the mind of a mother and her observations about her weird kid and family? Unfortunately, it's also based on too many similar events happening in America. But this is fiction and it's possible to appreciate it as fiction. Excellent novel!te it as fiction. Excellent novel!
B00005JKG9|4.0|What is there to say about a film where you have Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey all in the same room at one time? Oh, and it's written and directed by David Mamet.<br /><br />I'd heard of this film but didn't know much about it. After watching it, I'm surprised I waited so long. Glengarry Glen Ross is the kind of film that actors both love and dread to work on. As Alan Arkin says in the special features, it was the most exacting work any of the actors had ever done. The Mamet script comes through a bit intensely sometimes when you can hear the repetitiveness in the language, but with actors like these, it all feels natural, even when it seems a bit written.<br /><br />The story is engaging, and the transfer from stage to film is of the highest quality. Set in the Real Estate industry, Glenngarry Glen Ross is the story of four salesman and the stringent new guidelines they are put under in order to keep their jobs. Lemmon and Pacino shine especially brightly in this film, but the rest of the cast handle their characters with the superb skill we've all seen in their other films.<br /><br />This is a classic in every sense of the word.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this is a 2-disc set. Disc 1 just has the widescreen presentation of the film, while Disc 2 has the fullscreen presentation as well as a ton of special features... but I think being able to buy the fullscreen OR the widescreen would be good enough.
0743537009|1.0|This is a review on the Audio book, The Shining, read by Campbell Scott.<br />I love The Shining, its one of the best haunted house, er, hotel stories ever written. The movie was amazing as well, but lacked the in depth characterization that the book offers. To read The Shining, you get an insight into Jacks history, his reason for being jobless, the family connection, Danny's inner turmoil, the Outlooks History. I got the audio book to have at work, and was disappointed. To tell this story, from Jack, Danny's, and Wendy's point of view, and to really put to voice the terror, heartache and confusion King has in the book, you need someone who can relay that emotion and Campbell doesn't do it for me. He is too staccato in his pronunciation of words, too monotone at parts that are supposed to be read with agony, too breathy with his female voice. I found myself tuning him out because he was so boring, that I missed parts of the book and had to rewind.  This book is terrifying, campbell makes it just moderatly creepy.This same thing happened when I got \\"The Cell\\" on audiobook, Campbell also reads that one. If you love this book like I do, don't buy this, you will be disappointed with it.
B000002NBY|5.0|So much has been put into this album -- so much thought, melodies, harmonies and rhythms, instrumentation, fusion of different cultures, creativity, lyrics, ideas, atmosphere, complex and rich overlay of sounds. I marvel at the fact that someone could create this album.
B000H305U0|3.0|I initially gave Justin Timberlake's solo debut album Justified a 2-1/2-star rating, but if I were to review it NOW, I'd knock it up to at least a 3 because a few of the songs grew on me. And even for the songs that DIDN'T grow on me, you've still got to hand it to JT: you might not like a song from him, but when you hear him perform it live, you can't help but sing right along (\\"Rock Your Body\\", anyone?). Maybe that's going to be the case with FutureSex/LoveSounds too, because right now it really doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />As to how I can give a chart-topping artist's album a three-star rating, I think I'll briefly compare Justin to Usher, because both of these artists make very good SINGLES; the rest of the albums leave a little to be desired. Actually, I never could get into \\"SexyBack\\". It really isn't that bad of a song; but I agree with reviewer Ken Chien because I also don't understand why his voice is distorted like that. But \\"What Goes Around\\" is great; and you'd have to be dead to not be able to get into \\"My Love\\" (especially the \\"Let Me Talk to You\\" interlude).<br /><br />As I said before, though, the rest of the album suffers, and the reason why is, well, it all goes back to what I said to my brother a year or so ago. I was like, \\"Back in 1998, if you told me that Justin Timberlake would become a big R&B star, I'd be like, `You have GOT to be crazy.'\\" And sure, that's what happened, but the thing is, it almost seems like he's trying too hard to fit into the hip-hop scene here, which is something he shouldn't have to do on his second album. This is shown on the pointless Three 6 Mafia-assisted \\"Chop Me Up\\" (complete with a screwed and chopped chorus). And \\"Love Stoned\\" and \\"Sexy Ladies\\" are mindless club tracks.<br /><br />\\"Losing My Way\\" is a song that's reminiscent of Everlast's \\"What It's Like\\" about a man with a messed-up life (this time told in the first person), but it starts off sloppily with: \\"Hi, my name is Bob/And I work at my job\\". But the album's lowest point would probably have to be \\"Damn Girl\\". Not only does it have a generic chorus, but Justin goes 100% thug with \\"b\\" words and all (note to Justin: only rappers can get away with doing that, not R&B singers -- which seems kind of backwards, but...); and it isn't helped by Will.i.am's stuttered verse.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake can still sing, and he definitely has no problem selling records, but after a four-year absence he could've done a lot better than this. As I've said in the past, your best bet is to just download the singles.<br /><br />Anthony RupertBut the album's lowest point would probably have to be \\"Damn Girl\\".

B000000OPW|5.0|The other reviewers say it well. I'll just add my voice that this is a masterpiece. I remember it being no. 1 on the college charts for a long time, but didn't get to buy it until years later. 18 years after that I still often look forward to pulling it out and taking this surreal voyage. Watch out on 92 degree days. This album holds up to time. Check it out and expand your mind.

B000N3SS80|5.0|A word to those who forget what we are here for - to rate an album not to make personal attacks on an artist.  Take it somewhere else! <br /> <br />This CD is a pleasure to listen to with its beautiful ballads and soft pop.  A complete change from the musical work she's done in the past.  Some songs are beautifully arranged with the London Symphony Orchestra, others with cool electric guitar sounds.  I found each track to be distinct enough that I've played it often since its release.  \\"Tu\\" (electronics used to skew her chorus; nice touch), \\"Amarte es Todo\\" (nice slow dance), \\"Te Voy a Querer\\" (touch of Reggaeton),  \\"Porque te Marchas\\" (a torch song with guitar and piano), Como Ama Una Mujer\\" (a sexy, sweet sound), \\"Me Haces Falta\\" (cool guitar), etc.  Honestly, this is the best music she's ever done!  I hope she continues in this vein.... <br />
B000F39MAG|5.0|Elisabetta: Edita Gruberova<br /><br />Roberto: Roberto Aronica<br /><br />Nottingham: Albert Schagidullin<br /><br />Sara: Jeanne Piland<br /><br />Cecil: Manolito Mario Franz<br /><br />Paggio: Steven Humes<br /><br />Giacomo il Re: Johannes Klama (silenzio)<br /><br />Bayerisher Staatsoper<br /><br />Friedrich Haider conducting<br /><br />Staging: Christopf Loy<br /><br />Sets, costumi: Herbert Murauer<br /><br />Video director: Brian Large<br /><br />****************************<br /><br />Forget history, forget tradition.  This is a modern conceptualization of English monarchy. A monarchy where things have not changed; executions still exist, the Queen's law still,well, LAW.  Martial law, perhaps.  This is a current-day England, stark, austere surroundings, not a hint of warmth.  Severe, tailored suits for both the men and women; only Elizabeth is allowed any kind of color in her own outfits.  The set resembles not so much a palace as a corporate boardroom that's all business, all in blacks and grays.<br /><br />I'm usually against most \\"updatings\\" because they go into weird conceptualizations that have nothing to do with the premise; often times, there will be gimmicks and distractions to take us away from the music, even to the core of the drama, and worse, the singing.  Not this production. It rather ingeniously conjures up another kind of kingdom, repressive, and severe, as if the royal figure wanted to keep matters in firm check against any kind of a \\"personal ruling\\" aspect.  Oddly enough, it works. If you can forget history (Donizetti does anyway; he has Elizabeth abdicating to \\"Giacomo, il Re\\" at the end), this is an intriguing concept. Christopf Loy forsakes excessive gimmickry and focuses on the dramas inherent, aided by Herbert Murauer's spare sets and costumes.  What this creates is an explosive drama about infidelity ( (imagined and real), betrayal and treason at its most grim. It is often brutal, tense and powerful; these figures emerge as unerringly real people.  Amazingly enough, it only serves as to how astonishingly modern Donizetti's score is.  No other musical drama depicts such a marvelous dichotomy of Elizabeth the Queen versus the Woman.  The opera looks way way forward ahead of its time, presenting the queen in a psychological depth unheard of in the \\"bel canto\\" genre. Poor Donizetti lost his wife during a cholera epidemic in this time, and he seems to transmute his misery through this brilliant, evocative score.  The queen's emotions scream out the agony of her dilemma, and this staging makes that pain really, vividly manifest.  It is the score of a man beside himself with grief.<br /><br />Loy has fleshed out all the characters indelibly.  Quite often, the \\"secondary\\" chracters take a back seat to the leads, but not here.  Sara and Nottingham are presented as a couple truly \\"in extremis,\\" where marital trust and suspicion play a horrifying reality not usually encountered in opera. Sara, tormented by love for Roberto, and torn by her wifely duties, is made a loomingly tragic figure.  Misunderstood and scapegoated by Nottingham's jealousy, she is much of a victim as Elizabeth.  Nottingham becomes the unwitting catalyst for the story's resolution.  Jeanne Piland and Albert Schagidullin give magnificent performances, not at all the \\"secondary\\" leads.  They are in the forefront of the drama, and they respond to their assignments with unerring skill.  Piland has a full-bodied mezzo which she uses expressively in her aria, \\"All'aflitto,\\" (whose melody inspired Verdi's \\"Va, pensiero\\"), full of foreboding and remorse. Schagidullin, frankly, has a rather gritty, Germanesque throatiness, but what an actor.  He depicts his character's vengeance and horror at Sara's alleged duplicity with marvelous intensity. Roberto Aronica, in the title role, scores a triumph.  No \\"park and bark\\" tenor, he seizes the opportunity to create a real 3 dimensional figure. He allows himself to be blindfolded and stripped down tohis underwear in the last act aria and cabaletta. Furthermore, he strives to sing expressively, putting real meaning into his words and angling to flesh out a real character worthy of the Queen's attentions.<br /><br />This documentation of Edita Gruberova's Elisabetta may in fact be her finest, most committed, and certainly most \\"demented\\" performance. She's in Rysanek territory here. This conceptualization suits her to perfection. Here, playing the aging Queen, she has no need to be a younger personage. Outfitted in severe, tailored suits with a strawberry-blond bouffant, she conjures up an unmistakable cross between Margaret Thatcher and the current Elisabeth herself. Gruberova commands the walk, motions, and stature of a Royal figure.  Though some of the sudden descents into the lower regions of her tone are a challenge for her bright, high-lying voice, she is in ideal form, making the most of the text and imbuing the line with sagacious skill. Gruberova etches the slow melodies with dynamic variety, while exhibiting immense dramatic power in the tense confrontations. She shirks none of the physical challenges, her body allowing itself to be used in every possible means to depict the Queen's increasing frustration and loss of control.  The final scene though, is where Gruberova pulls out all the stops. After delivering a pain-wracked \\"Vivi ingrato,\\" with long-lined expressivity, the discovery of Roberto's unwarranted execution, bringing about Elisabetta's abdication, Gruberova tops all else she has done before. With nerve-shattering intensity, she delivers \\"Quel sangue versato\\" as if this were her last performance.  Gruberova does her classic wig-removing bit, where you see the balding, pathetic Queen exposed as a completely broken woman; \\"Non regno, non VI-vo\\" and she means it. Gruberova seems to be living in the moment. Face slack with shock, hyperventilating in desperation, close-ups reveal the extent of her involvement. After abdicating to her nephew, the Queen staggers upstage, and collapses, topples over into insane, abject grief.  Her soul is dead, she is no more.  This is operatic drama at its most powerful and brutally realistic.Furthermore, he strives to sing expressively, putting real meaning into his words and angling to flesh out a real character worthy of the Queen's attentions.  <br /> <br />This documentation of Edita Gruberova's Elisabetta may in fact be her finest, most committed, and certainly most \\"demented\\" performance.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is not an album that will grab you on first listen.  But give it a few spins, and it is sure to blow you away.   It is so good, it gives me chills.   An astounding work of art.
B000002OX7|5.0|Judging from the almost unanimous outpouring of praise for this album, one could say that The Who's album \\"Who's Next\\" is not only their masterpiece, but one of only a handful of rock's masterpieces. I couldn't agree more. Many have eloquently described the many virtues of this amazing record and I can't improve on this.  However, I must say that \\"The Song is Over\\" is in many ways my favorite cut on this album.  There are so many great things about it.  It has the longest intro without Moon's drumming in any Who song, thereby making his entrance all the more exciting in the bridge.  The piano chord voicing with 9ths is really majestic, expecially in the hands of session player, Nicky Hopkins. Then there's Townshend's vocal, which displays a vulnerability that you don't hear from him that often and it's really cool. And the song builds to a powerful crescendo during the coda, where we hear the first strains of \\"Pure and Easy.\\"  Add to this, the explosive drumming of Moon as he plays measure after measure of sixteenth note tom rolls, without missing a beat.  What a great tune!
0312995423|1.0|If there was a Mystery Science Theater for books, this book would be perfect fodder because it' so bad it's laughable.  It's about 90% computer-speak and Dan Brown has obviously made up absolutely all of the computer and \\"encryption theory\\" content in his head, without bothering to do even a modicum of research.   If you know even a little about computers you'll roll on the floor laughing, and if you know anything about encryption you'll laugh so hard you'll choke.       But if you don't know enough to appreciate the absurdity of the technospeak, don't worry.  The \\"thriller\\" aspect of the book is just as pathetic.  The hero is a professor of linguistics, fer crissakes, yet the National Security Agency chooses him as their agent on the most critical mission they've ever had, which is to recover an encryption key that is supposed to give access to the most powerful encryption software ever invented, software which would put the NSA out of business if it were ever made widely available.  The first thing our hero does upon landing in Spain is to go to the cops and ask for all of the possessions of a man (the inventor of the incredible encryption software) who died the day before.  And the tough Spanish police lieutenant give it to him without asking a single question!        That of itself could be glossed over, but every page is simply full of ridiculous things like that.     If you want a literary Mystery Science Theater experience go ahead and read this thing.  Otherwise save your money.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Many people, especially those old enough to remember when the book In Cold Blood came out, know about the hoopla caused by Capote's best known work.  They and many others afterwards have heard about Capote's work on the book, have seen the movie made several years ago, and may even remember that he wrote almost nothing after.  Seeing the process, however, is very different.  This movie drives home the machinations -- the possible heartlessness -- that went into the research and publication and they are almost too much to bear. <br /> <br />The movie itself is starkly done.  The dialog is sparse.  Yet, we see into the heart and soul of the writer and killer who so fascinated Capote, even if only for a moment.  Viewers can't take their eyes away from the friendship that grows between the two, until Perry is cut off at the knees, being left to flounder in his own guilt and isolation.  It's difficult not to wonder if Capote's tears are genuine; yet at the same time it is equally difficult not to feel a touch of compassion for him. <br /> <br />It is agreed by many literary experts that In Cold Blood changed certain aspects of writing forever.  The subject alone is chilling.  Those involved, directly or indirectly, never forgot any detail.  There are two characters here who demonstrate the thin line between genius and madness.  The quiet telling of that story makes the impact even more powerful.

Initially, I was interested in it because it was touted in at least one of the reviews as a monologue, and I enjoy novels written in this style; however, because the author uses quote marks around what the characters say, it's not an interior monologue in the purest sense.  <br /> <br />I wish this book were written in that style. Shouldn't it be? Isn't the intent to bring the protagonist alive? What he does is important but what he thinks is even more important.  <br /> <br />Putting quote marks around what the characters say creates, for me, a problem. I'm asked to accept the SUBJECTIVE observations of the narrator, but at times I'm asked to accept as fact that a certain action objectively occurred.  <br /> <br />I do agree with the protagonist that firms such as Underwood and Samson ultimately are evil. The protagonist finds out that the Constitution doesn't apply in the workplace. A good point is raised because few people think about how unfair this is. Why should our civil liberties stop at the doorstep of a company? <br /> <br />I think the author chose names carefully in this book. Most people associate \\"Underwood\\" with the devil symbol on their line of canned goods. There's also a suggestion of \\"under\\"-handedness. The name \\"Samson\\" is associated with power. So, basically the company is a powerful devil.  <br /> <br />Minor quibbles:  <br /> <br />I don't like the metaphor of Princeton University as a slattern who \\"raises her skirts\\" and \\"shows good skin.\\"  <br /> <br />Also, two exclamation marks in one paragraph is at least one too many. <br /> <br />And there you have it. <br />
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is one cool white boy poet among rappers! Over the past few years, I've been avoiding these 'in your face','woman hater',nasty rapper boys and their songs. I'd heard the stock stuff that's been the popular rap fare on the radio, and saw my 'innocent' young boys (my sons, age 12 and 10) rocking to it, intoning the lyrics along with the nasty boy on the air at that moment: \\"shut up b...ch', 'I'm gonna slap you, h.!', etc. blah blah blah.  I would inwardly frown, and try to keep my 'wet blanket' hostile attitude to myself!  After all, I fancied myself a 'modern' Mom, who'd let her boys decide for themselves what music they like.  I wasn't afraid it would 'turn them into' angry girl-haters or street thugs. I knew, and still believe, that, when they see a Mom who respects their freedom to hear whatever they like (ok, with a few lines in the sand, when they go totally overboard), and come to the best decison about women, violence, rebellion, and all!<br />The key turning point, that made me decide to tune into Eminem, and see whether he actually has something good to offer with his stuff, that maybe, just maybe, has passion, soul, and POWER,(as any song that's heavy on sex and violence inevitably MUST also have, or else it becomes truly just angry junk food music), was my viewing of the movie \\"Scary Movie 3\\".  Specifically, when I saw the white 'farm boy' rapper, who my boys told me was actually a parody of EMINEM, do his priceless 'rap' contest performance, then, I thought....This is totally cool!  Let's buy an Eminem CD, and check out the boy!<br />Well, it only took one spin of Tracks 1,2, and 3,(and one or two later tracks, with a twist on the same themes as the first 3 songs), with their amazing powerful tongue-in-cheek, SLAMMINGLY effective, simultaneous parody of self (Mr. Slim Shady),and the 'ladies' (girlfriend, husband-blaming,  wallowing in victimhood, mother, who he wants to 'f..', or bossy ladies on the warpath, or music executives who want to 'silence' his music's soul, cause it's too full of anger at their greed and jaded materialism, and so tell him in bored, whiny voices to try to write stuff that 'sells'), to fall in love with this POET EXTRAORDINAIRE, and his lyrics, which do some heavy duty spittin' on ladies (and men), but also can end with a softly spoken, sweet \\"I'm just foolin' ladies! You know I love you\\".  I knew at once that this young man moved me, and that he spoke to me as well as to the boys groovin' to his beat and his poetic honest, no b.s., lyrics!<br />THIS IS ONE GENIUS THAT SHOWS WHAT RAP AT ITS BEST CAN BE, AND I AM HOOKED.  I do laugh and shake my head, and cringe at times, when EMINEM spits out one or another line about his g.f. tied up in the trunk!  But I also can't help but privately rock myself, and 'rap' with him, and say, keep on rocking Mr. Slim Shady...You got a soul, and you keep on sharing it with your generation, mine, and my kids' !!music's soul, cause it's too full of anger at their greed and jaded materialism, and so tell him in bored, whiny voices to try to write stuff that 'sells'), to fall in love with this POET EXTRAORDINAIRE, and his lyrics, which do some heavy duty spittin' on ladies (and men), but also can end with a softly spoken, sweet \\"I'm just foolin' ladies!

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|But it seems that this is one band that people (including myself) really like the original sound of.  On \\"Is This It?\\" and \\"Room On Fire\\" they had such a new sound that nobody had ever heard yet.  However, they have since traded in their patented sound for a slower, more slurred sound.  Because of this change in sound, this album flopped.<br /><br />Although, it isn't a total let down.  \\"On The Other Side\\" is a really cool song.  I also really like \\"Heart In A Cage.\\"  It seems, if anything, the album progressively gets slower and more boring as it drags on.  But the first few tracks are good.  (For a perfect example of a sleeper track, listen to \\"Fear Of Sleep\\")<br /><br />Overall, I'd still buy it, as I'm a big strokes fan.  But you might want to buy it used or on sale.
B000JJSJR8|5.0|...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.<br /><br />Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.<br /><br />Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.<br /><br />The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.<br /><br />I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is absolutely stunning in 1080p and is surely reference quality stuff. The DTS HD-MA sound is also amazing and there are plenty of extras. A total must-have.lm of the two, plain and simple.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This is now my second favorite album behind \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"  (You just can't beat that one.  It's a masterpiece.)  But this album is a must-have.  It's loaded with classics such as \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Today,\\" and \\"Disarm.\\"  Even the songs on this that aren't hits are still amazing, such as \\"Luna\\" and \\"Spaceboy.\\"  This album has a five-star average for a reason.

B00005U122|5.0|Being a fan of Pink Floyd's music in the early 80's, this DVD was a real treat!  For the first time, seeing Roger Waters singled out was a real eye opener for me.  I had only really thought of Pink Floyd as a sum of its parts; not as unique musicians coming together to be a part of something very special. <br />Seeing Roger on stage, behind the scenes and interacting with his fellow band mates made everything seem more \\"real\\", better understood. <br />I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD for those who are only even partially interested in Pink Floyd's music.  The sound quality is unbelieveable and the video quality is at least as good. <br /> <br />\\"Shine on, you crazy diamond!\\"
0394740815|4.0|An intoxicating blend of literary and genre fiction from Roald Dahl.  I'll be buying volume 2 on the strength of volume one.  I read \\"Man From The South\\" nearly twenty years ago and have never forgotten it.  Imagine a master storyteller relating a hair raising tale in very calm and matter of fact tones and you get a good idea of Dahl's \\"voice\\".  The most fantastic premise seems plausible when Dahl is relating the details.  \\"Georgy Porgy\\" is phenomenal, as is \\"The Sound Machine\\".  \\"William and Mary\\" is another eye opener (read it, then excuse my pun).  If you think Dahl is a \\"children's author\\", think again.  Highly recommended.
B0000028UK|5.0|This rocks! Its the best. If you like Pearl Jam you either own this or should be ordering it right now. More fluid than Ten and less out there than Vitology or No Code this could, dare I say is there best album. From beginning to end you'll throw your head around and maybe other stuff too.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is the first time I have done a review, but the WOW factor of this DVD series is so off the charts, it would be a shame not to share! <br /> <br />First off, I watch on an Xbox 360 HD DVD and a 720P HDTV. The photography looks amazing. I can only imagine how much beter it would look on 1080P big screen. <br /> <br />Second, they advertise that you will see our planet as you have never seen it before. This is absolutely true. The places and things they show you make you realize how vast our planet is and how much of it really goes unseen. <br /> <br />If you have any lingering doubts about why you have an HDTV and HD DVD set up, or whether you should, get this and remove those doubts from your mind!
B00006F7S4|5.0|There are two Becks. One is funky with a pop sensibility and radio hits galore, the other the mellow folksy lyricist. This is definitely the latter. Like Mutations you must let it grow on you, once it does it will be forever in your rotation.
B000MG1YC0|5.0|This is some of the better symphonic metal I have heard. I am glad they decided to keep the death growls to a minimum (they only appear briefly on 3 tracks). That is not my thing and would have prevented me from buying this disc if there had been more. The female vocals are not quite the calibur of Nightwish but they are very good. The music is modern and catchy but there is much more to this outing than what you normally get on the radio these days. Imagine the symphonic metal excess of Nightwish mixed with the radio rock accessibility of Evanescence.
B00005JPAO|5.0|My daughter and I watched this together and were impressed at the sensitive, polite performances depicting some high profile, very-much-alive characters. Not an easy task by any means.  Helen Mirren deserves her Oscar for her Elizabeth, a self-sufficient stiff-upper-lip but terribly out of touch monarch.  Her relationship to the Queen Mother is touching and tender and how she and Prince Philip maintain their marriage, one obviously built upon respect for the other, refreshingly candid.  Prince Charles appeared truly blindsided and deeply wounded over Diana's death and his only concern seemed to be for his children, and how Diana appeared to them in the end.  The tabloids and TV were forbidden to the children and wisely so; they'd lost their mother not a celebrity after all.  The movie well explains why the monarchy kept a low profile.  It had very much to do with family loyalty and the feelings of Diana's boys, whom Prince Philip adores and did his best to divert wholesomely through outdoor activities during that extremely difficult period. (The parallel between the hunt for the stag on the royal property and how Elizabeth felt hunted by the press struck me greatly.) Tony Blair's character depicted a conflicted man torn between plans for \\"modernisation\\" and the long-standing dignity of an increasingly antiquated monarchy.  In his off hours he's a loving family man who admires his intelligent wife, at work he treats his staff as equals intellectually and socially, and has the best interests of his nation, including the monarchy, at heart.  The footage of Diana and the public mourning brought great immediacy to the story. In the end, Elizabeth, despised and misunderstood, comes out to greet the people who accused her of such coldheartedness.  Mirren shines in these scenes.  She is truly magnificent and stalwart, and though she might not have approved of Diana's decisions and actions, we cannot fault her.  She is only human.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|I've been watching this series on Discovery HD and it is breathtaking. I ordered the DVD as opposed to the HD DVD because we don't have an HD DVD player and I didn't think there would be much difference. Was I wrong! If you've been watching the series on HD, you've been spoiled like myself and you will be very disappointed by the quality of the picture in the plain DVD. I'm now going to get the HD DVD and save it for when we upgrade our player.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|My daughter and her friends have been liking Avril for some time but this new album chalk full foul language and horrible attitude is not going to be suitable for my daughter.

032147404X|3.0|I found this book to be interesting specially if you are a newbie in digital photography, or at least you intend to know a little bit more on how to make some photos look like professional photos.  <br /> <br />Scott gives you an approach to photography like a friend would do on the field, and for someone who doesn't want to have all the \\"why's\\" answered with technical details, this may be the stuff you are looking for.  <br /> <br />Scott's humour also gives you this friendly approach, although sometimes he exaggerates... <br /> <br />In the overall, this is a nice book to someone who wants to aspire a little bit higher than just taking holiday photos. <br />
B00005JPD0|5.0|Preferably before you watch this movie, you should read the book called \\"The Holographic Universe.\\" You should also read about the Montauk project, or study Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Time travel is possible and always has been possible. It is not science fiction. It is highly difficult to understand from our perspective, but it is not impossible. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with concepts of time travel and real nature of the things you see around us, then you will appreciate the depth of this movie. Because of the depth of this movie (by way of showing an accurate portrayal of the technology that has already come to fruition) I could give it no less than a 5 star review.  <br /> <br />No other movie has attempted to show what is really possible without screwing up the realism by going totally overboard. This movie, while lacking in trite organization, is filled with semi-realistic technology and physics concepts that are normally non-existent in the realm of Hollywood.  <br /> <br />Denzel is amazing. For his acting alone, this movie is enjoyable.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000O75F7C|5.0|Being an avid progressive rock fan, I gave these guys a listen a few years back with \\"Deadwing\\" and was quite impressed.

0380789027|5.0|I'd read a couple of the stories in this collection before (notably \\"We Can Get Them for You Wholesale,\\" and \\"Snow, Glass, Apples\\") and I've been a fan of his longer fiction and graphic novels for some time, but this was the first time I'd really immersed myself in his short stories.  It was definitely an experience. <br /> <br />What struck me the most is how different most of these stories are.  In his (excellent) introduction, Gaiman himself talks about specific influences for several of the stories and poems, and about different \\"voices\\" he's written them in.  The difference really is astounding.  \\"Chivalry\\" is nothing like \\"Murder Mysteries,\\" which is nothing like \\"When We Went to See the End of the World...\\"  Of course, some stories are more similar than others, but his range is pretty incredible.  The only thing the works share is that they're pretty darn good. <br /> <br />Of course, in any collection, there are going to be high points and low points.  The thing with Smoke and Mirrors is that even the low points are good.  A few of the poems, and maybe one or two of the stories weren't exactly my cup of tea, they were well done.  And the reason I gave this book five stars is that the stories that were my cup of tea were so good that I didn't mind it when or two missed the mark. <br /> <br />Make sure you do more than skim the introduction.  He's buried a story in there that's well worth reading, and I found myself skipping back to the introduction after each story, to get a little more perspective on what I'd read. <br />
0393307050|4.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER, the first of twenty complete novels and one unfinished volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series, is a mixture of both pleasing and annoying elements, though I do believe that the earlier outweigh the latter.  Set primarily on the high seas along the European coast with a few incursions onto English land, this historical novel portrays the adventures of the sloop \\"Sophie\\" as she battles the French and Spanish during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s.<br /><br />Pleasing elements include the very human traits of the character of Jack Aubrey, who has just risen from the rank of lieutenant to that of master and has been given his first command of a ship of war.  The reader shares his mixed emotions, ranging from pride that comes from being called \\"Captain\\" to estrangement from crew mates that inevitably results from his position of supreme authority aboard ship to disappointment that his ship is merely a sloop and not a man-of-war.  We see Aubrey's attempt to mimic the great fighting ships fail miserably as the cannons he has had mounted on her bow threaten to dismember her timbers with their recoil, and we feel his resignation as he has them returned to the shipyard.  We also come to understand Aubrey's motivation, accurate for the time period, not to achieve memorable military victories but to enrich himself (with a paltry bit for his officers and crew) by capturing prizes such as merchant ships not under English protection.  We are also privy to many of his foibles, which include his chagrin at catching a venereal disease from his high-ranking mistress who has obviously been a trifle too flirtatious in his absence.<br /><br />A few other characters, including of course the second main protagonist of the novel, Dr. Stephen Maturin, are also well developed for the reader's enjoyment.  Maturin is portrayed as a superb physician, an erudite student of nature, and a consummate wordsmith whose tongue is always ready with an appropriate Latin phrase or precise English locution for the topic at hand.  He is also versed in Catalan and can correct Aubrey's poor attempts at French. In medicine, Maturin is a miracle worker, able to repair a depressed skull fracture by removing the top of a sailor's skull and resuscitating a drowned midshipman.  Maturin's skills may strain credulity, but his naivety at all things naval or military is endearing.<br /><br />Actually, my favorite character portrayal is that of the pederast mate who adores Aubrey, who in turn is oblivious to the nature of the man's devotion and sees him merely as a loyal and able seaman.  This particular example tells us much of Aubrey's innocence and ignorance of many facets of life, his incredible luck as a ship's master notwithstanding, and of Maturin's vocabulary since it is he who describes the man as a \\"pederast.\\"<br /><br />In addition to character portrayals, one of the strongest elements of the book is the picture it gives us of the nature of European marine warfare at the beginning of the 19th century.  It is portrayed as a strange mixture of utter barbarity, with chains shot from cannons eviscerating sailors, and of gentile manners with victorious captains entertaining their captive equivalents with sumptuous meals and gentlemanly conversation.  For officers, at least, if one was not cut down by a cannon ball, warfare was more or less a civilized pursuit in which capture, release upon parole, and eventual formal exchange was the understood procedure.  This concept of \\"civilized warfare\\" is nearly surreal when contrasted with the impersonal ravaging of modern wars and forces one to think that perhaps civilization has retreated from a higher state of two centuries ago.  In any event, the historical picture is a valuable one.<br /><br />To the novel's discredit, its author throws technical terms about willy-nilly, and if one is not conversant with the architecture, sails and rigging of a late 18th to early 19th century sailing ship, the significance of quite a few orders being issued from the quarterdeck will be lost upon the reader.  Neither is the tendency to overawe the reader with linguistic oddities limited to seafaring terms.  Aubrey comes out with British colloquialisms now and then (\\"I'm clemmed.\\"), and words such as \\"tremontana\\" occur with some regularity.  Having a large dictionary at hand when reading MASTER AND COMMANDER is almost a necessity.  There are also spots in which the story line is broken by skips in chronology, and the reader must reconstruct in his mind the missing intervening events that brought the characters to their present situations; this becomes more evident near the end of the book, as if the author were rushing to a conclusion and leaving out bits and pieces here and there.  In this regard, a few references pop up for which the reader has not been prepared, such as a mention late in the book to the Sophie's four lunatics-to which the reader has never been introduced before.<br /><br />Considering both the strengths and weaknesses in the novel, I must conclude that I am far from agreeing with a New York Times book reviewer that the Aubrey/Maturin series are \\"the best historical novels ever written.\\"  Their predecessors, the Hornblower novels by C. S. Forester, are surely of equivalent if not of higher quality, although each is shorter and may lack some of the complexity of character development found in the Aubrey/Maturin stories.  Still, MASTER AND COMMANDER has been a fairly captivating read and has inspired me to proceed to the next novel in the series.  If one has enjoyed Forester's Hornblower series, he will enjoy O'Brien's novels as well, for they are very similar in genre.  However, if one is approaching this particular type of historical novel for the first time, may I suggest that Forester may prove a better read than O'Brian?<br /><br />\\"O'Brian,\\" by the way, is an assumed name for a somewhat ne'er-do-well Englishman actually named Richard Patrick Russ (1914-2000), whose own life is interesting if perhaps somewhat unenviable.

B000NA77YO|4.0|THE BAND: Ronnie James Dio (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitars), Geezer Butler (bass), Geoff Nichols (keyboards), Bill Ward (drums on songs from \\"Heaven And Hell\\" only), Vinny Appice (drums on all other tracks).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 16 tracks clocking in at approximately 79 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song titles/credits, band members, what songs came from which albums, and a brief history/interview of the band during the Dio years. This release covers material from 1980-1992, and includes 3 new songs recorded in 2006/7. Digitally remastered sound. Label - Warner Bros / Rhino.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Heaven And Hell (5 songs), Mob Rules (4), Dehumanizer (3), Live Evil (1), Unreleased (3).<br /><br />COMMENTS: After Rhino and Warner Bros put out \\"Symptom Of The Universe\\" (2002) covering the Ozzy years, I figured they had to do something with the Dio material. Thankfully I wasn't holding my breath... because 5 years later in '07, here it is finally. Another welcome addition would be to give us fans another Black Sabbath compilation covering the best of the Tony Martin era (\\"The Eternal Idol\\", \\"Headless Cross\\", \\"TYR\\", and \\"Cross Purposes\\")... that would make the trilogy complete. Dio's material with Sabbath was always strong, and somehow I picture Ronnie James Dio with Sabbath much longer than only 3 albums worth. Dio just seemed to be a great fixture in the band and at the time - the perfect replacement for Ozzy. Being an old school rocker from the 70's, I often wondered if anyone could replace Ozzy Osbourne... and Dio took it on and ended up doing an amazing job. Dio produced two classic albums with Sabbath in \\"Heaven And Hell\\" (1980) and \\"Mob Rules\\" (1981), followed by a good album over ten years later with \\"Dehumanizer\\" (1992). As for the songs on this release - most are well chosen, but there are some interesting inclusions and odd omissions. The staples are here - \\"Heaven And Hell\\", \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", \\"Turn Up The Night\\", \\"The Mob Rules\\", \\"Voodoo\\", \\"TV Crimes\\", etc. \\"Heaven And Hell\\" has 5 of the album's 8 songs included here (and rightfully so)... the only track missing is \\"Children Of The Sea\\" (however, they make up for it by including the 'live\\" version with track 13). \\"Die Young \\" and \\"Lonely Is The Word\\" are good songs, but by no means classic. There are 4 songs taken from \\"Mob Rules\\", and the only questionable inclusion here is \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\". Again, a good song... but, one of Dio's best songs in his catalog - \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" - absolutely needed to be here. The real question comes with \\"Dehumanizer\\". My 3 favorite songs here were also the most played from the album - \\"Time Machine\\", \\"Computer God\\" and \\"Master Of Insanity\\"... all strangely absent (\\"Time Machine\\" is the other song that needed to be here). While I miss all these omitted songs, this \\"Dio Years\\" disc is still a decent mix of songs from the era. The 3 new tracks are good (not instant classics, but still good) - one slow, one mid-tempo, and one fast... for me \\"Ear In The Wall\\" stands out. As with ALL compilations - the song selection will not be perfect. I honestly think to many reviewers here are knit-picking this release. \\"The Dio Years\\" is a nice package - a full disc of music, crisp sound, a lot of classic material, and for the most part good song selection.  (4 stars).ules\\", \\"Voodoo\\", \\"TV Crimes\\", etc. \\"Heaven And Hell\\" has 5 of the album's 8 songs included here (and rightfully so)... the only track missing is \\"Children Of The Sea\\" (however, they make up for it by including the 'live\\" version with track 13). \\"Die Young \\" and \\"Lonely Is The Word\\" are good songs, but by no means classic. There are 4 songs taken from \\"Mob Rules\\", and the only questionable inclusion here is \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\". Again, a good song... but, one of Dio's best songs in his catalog - \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" - absolutely needed to be here. The real question comes with \\"Dehumanizer\\".

0393327655|5.0|To say the least, Sam Harris has tackled a prickly topic here.  To question in today's day and age, whether religion is a positive thing, or should even exist, is cutting against the grain - at a bare minimum.  Harris does it well. <br /> <br />I happen to agree with Harris's premise; I can't accept a different level of evidence in the spiritual portion of my life than I expect and demand in every other part of my life, but even if you don't agree, there are some wonderfully thought-provoking concepts in this book.  I also give Harris credit for not blasting spirituality wholesale and for offering up a meaningful spiritual replacement for faith. <br /> <br />Harris offers some fairly devastating criticisms of today's religious faith.  He also shows courage by weighing in against religious \\"moderates\\"  <br />who do no direct harm (as fanatics and extremists do), but who offer a formidable buffer zone for the extremists to operate behind and who have the same justifications for their beliefs as do the extremists. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  If you have an open mind, you will find yourself thinking some very big thoughts in the course of reading it.  For the first time in my life, I contemplated the idea of a truly functional world government and what that might be like.  I came away believing more in a personal spirituality and in the inherent wonder in human beings without resorting to faith in a deity. <br /> <br />Very interesting, filled with smart and novel ideas, very hard to describe.  Give it a read with an open mind and it'll give you a broader perspective on many fronts.
B000O178BY|2.0|At some point, every industrial band makes a concept album about a bleak vision of the future. So I expected something brilliant, or at least interesting from Trent Reznor. This is neither brilliant, nor interesting, nor even thought-provoking. If this is Trent's vision of the future, the future sounds like 1990. There are a few decent tracks on here, to be fair, but if you know and love NIN's earlier work, this is pretty tame stuff by comparison. I've listened to it several times now, and it's NOT getting more interesting with repeated plays. Worst of all, it really doesn't have even one standout track that sticks in your head afterwards.
B00005OM5L|3.0|I bought this DVD with high hopes, despite Joshua's comment about \\"I Shot The Sherrif,\\" because of all of the other rave reviews of it being the best of all, etc. I am also going to preface this by saying that I am a huge Clapton fan. I have been had the great pleasure of seeing him perform live and own virtually all of his DVD's and most of the CD's as well. While I don't quite agree with some that he is, in fact, God, I do believe God definitely plays through his hands. In another life, I would certainly hope to have the talent to do what he does. However you want to take that, my point is that on a bad day he is one of the top 3 humans who have ever played a guitar, regardless of the style. That said, that day at Hyde Park was not his best performance by a long shot. For one thing, there were probably 200,000 people in the crowd, so the sound engineering was set up accordingly. But in the DVD transfer, to me the clarity of his work as well as that of his band got muffled and a bit lost in the wind and ominous weather that day. And maybe because of the monstrous crowd size, he seemed as though he was a bit detached and unconnected to the crowd. Compared with other performances of his, this one looked stiff and wooden. Again, although he can be the best on a bad day, this was one of them. By the time he got to \\"I Shot the Sherrif,\\" I too was looking to the remote to skip the song. In my opinion it was that bad of a rendition of what is truly one of my favorite songs. I hung in to watch his guitar work and the blonde singer doing backup, but a lesser fan would not have been as likely to. I would not recommend this piece and gave it 3 stars only because of who Clapton is.
0307275639|5.0|This book had a great impact on my life and one that I will hold near to my heart forever. Morrie was the type of person I would hope to be able to meet someday. Even though he is dying and in the last days of his life he still manages to take time to give his last lesson in life--the meaning of life. He shares his experiences with his old college student who has returned after sixteen years and they both embark on a life altering journey for both of them. Mitch is a busy, workaholic who hardly has time for life and love and Morrie is a man who has lived life to the fullest. When these two men come together there is so  that happens. It's an emotional ride for the reader but there are so many great quotes and lessons Morrie shares. Mitch's life is changed after spending each Tuesday with Morrie. This is a book everyone should read. It's a good lesson on both life and dying and one that is full of emotion, compassion, love and spirit.
B000PUAHOY|5.0|Shot on digital video, rather than film, David Lynch's \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" takes him out of the mainstream, if you can call \\"Mulholland Drive\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" mainstream, into the realm of pure Independent film making: producing films with little money and without any outside interference.<br />At the beginning of this film Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace, a diva-like actress frantically waiting for word from the producers of a film that she would like to do. This part of the film is very straightforward but Lynch straightforward which means that 1+1 almost never equals 2. This is where Nikki/Laura begins. By the end of the film she/they are unhappy, bored, frantic, living in a one-story, California Ranch-style house in what looks to be the Inland Empire (Riverside, Corona): the fastest growing section of Southern California. Does this have any significance as far as Lynch is concerned or is his Inland Empire one of the mind? I don't really know for sure and in Lynch's world this ambiguity makes the proceedings troubling, puzzling and fascinating all at the same time. Rational ambivalence is called for when dealing (as in viewing and describing) with Lynch's films except maybe for the almost straightforward and appropriately named, \\"Straight Story.\\"<br />In regards to Laura Dern: as Jeanne Moreau was for Godard, as Deneuve was for Bunuel and Truffaut, as Audran was for Bunuel and Chabrol, Dern is Lynch's muse: the actress he chooses to personify his dreams and nightmares. Dern is neither a plush toy nor a sexpot-type of actress. She is tall, imposing yet warm, emotionally available, argumentative, brittle, ready and willing to give any man or woman a run for their money in life as well as in bed. Look to Lynch's recurring choice of Dern for hints as to what is going on his volatile mind and his brilliant films.<br />There are moments of great beauty and clarity here for Lynch is nothing if not a superior artist capable of making his striking images, film moments and whole scenes effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.<br />\\"I Don't Get IT\\"......\\" You Got IT!\\" (as quoted from\\" Premiere\\" which also states that Lynch himself has explained \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" as making \\"perfect sense.\\") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.   \\"I Don't Get IT\\"......\\" You Got IT!\\" (as quoted from\\" Premiere\\" which also states that Lynch himself has explained \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" as making \\"perfect sense.\\") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Even after watching this movie, I'm still not sure what I think.  Babel demands a lot of energy from the viewer but it doesn't even try to return the favour.  Four stories that don't seem connected at first glance basically end up staying that way.  There's merely small references here and there that supposedly bind them together, but sadly there's no real point to even portraying any of these four stories in the first place. They are merely sad segments of different people's lives in different situations.  The movie might have some merit if it was actually trying to tell four stories rather than four montages.  It's unfortunate that Cate Blanchett wasn't given the opportunity to shine in this movie because she is a truly amazing actress.

0143034901|5.0|I have been reading novels since i started High School, and out of the thousands that i have read throughout the years, there is not one that i would say i enjoyed more than The Shadow of the Wind. I  found it very consuming, and i regretted the day when i had to turn that last page. I just wanted it to go on forever.<br /><br />You start with a young boy being given a book by his father, and that book takes him down a path, that he will not want to come back from. After reading the book, he goes in search of more by that same author, only to find that he can't get any of them. They have either all been sold or stolen. The boy then goes on a search to find out what happened to the author, only to find it ended in a terrible tragedy. As the story begins flow out, the reader will find that the boy's life begins to parallel with the life of the author.<br /><br />A very good book, one that i would give a six star to, if i could. I found that as the book went on i wanted it to hurry up, so i could find out more, but at the same time, i didn't want it to ever end. A really good book, that i would recommend to any reader that is interested in a good read.
1563894696|5.0|This is my favorite Batman TPB thus far, for many reasons. First of all, I thought the entire plot was spectacular; a little bit \\"Sopranos\\", a little \\"Godfather\\", but completely believable for the Gotham world, not hammy or out-of-place. Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone is actually a suave, cool figure in his own right, along with the other members of the \\"family\\" (not to spoil too much, but especially a certain member featured in the very end). This very cool plot line is deliciously peppered with the classic Arkham gang, all of the favorites are here more or less in funny cameos (Joker and Scarecrow/Hatter were my personal favorites), with the exception of Catwoman, who is featured heavily, and I must say, expertly drawn and written. Somehow, the heroes are not neglected at all, least of all tragic Harvey Dent, whose mental decline is another great highlight in the meaty story. We see Bruce take on the host of villains, team with Jim Gordon to solve the murder, and even fall a couple of times, as well as his sexually tense relationship with Selina Kyle and her alter-ego. Not as in-depth with Bruce Wayne as, say, \\"Year One\\", but he is true to character, and retains his overall strength against adversity-- probably his most important character trait.<br /><br />The artwork is superb; I even prefer the more bright, dramatized stylizations of Tim Sale's work, and every villain was drawn spot-on, in my opinion. The only point of contention is Bruce himself, sometimes a tiny bit awkward in face, but that has more to do with my personal tastes. Gotham is dark, moody, and slick. Very well done stuff.<br /><br />I don't even think I could complain about anything here. A fantastic book, and a must-have for any Batman collection, or people who are only familiar with \\"Batman Begins\\" or the movies. The entire plot is here, you don't necessarily need to read any prior or later books as it stands alone, and it is simply a great book. If you like the Batman world even a little bit or are curious, start with this book!or are curious, start with this book!
068987474X|5.0|I thought this book was brilliant. When I read the book I was having a hard time dealing with a break up with a guy that I thought was the one but of course he wasn't.  After reading this book it opened my eyes to see who I really was.  I realized that I was a better person than he could ever be and that I deserve to be with someone who \\"IS ALL INTO ME\\" for the right reasons of course.  So I stood my ground and lived my life for me not for finding Mr. Right.  And of course when I lease expected it I did find the right guy for me.  We have recently celebrated our one year anniversary and I look forwar to many more.  We are hoping to get married next year, but not wanting to rush anything.  Girls, keep your heads up high and NEVER depend on a guy to make you happy.  Trust me MR. RIGHT is out there so live your life for you not MR. RIGHT NOW!!!
0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb is one of the best writers I've ever come across.  The Farseer-Liveship-Tawny Man series has been a joy to read and incredibly easy to become immersed in.  If you havn't read the first books by Hobb, stop reading this and check out [[ASIN:055357339X Assassin's Apprentice (The Farseer Trilogy, Book 1)]].<br /><br />In Fool's Fate, Fitz takes a somewhat less central role as a sort of Skill master for Prince Dutiful and a nanny for Thick.  His role as the Changer is still paramount to the story and his decisions have drastic effects on the world.  True dragons become real to the people of the Six Dutchies and an ancient enemy from the Red Ships War returns to harass Fitz and his friends.<br /><br />The over-riding theme of the story is about friendship and love and acceptance of fate.  The relationships between Fitz and the people in his life (especially the Fool), are deep and complex.  As Fitz experiences hardships and victories, you'll find your emotions rise and fall in time with his.  Hobb is one of the very best at making human emotion so real and powerful.<br /><br />While parts of this final book were a bit slower than what we're used to from Hobb, it was still an excellent read.  It also accomplished the daunting task of wrapping up an epic story in a way that leaves the reader satisfied and not wishing for more.  I doubt that some of the other big-time authors (Jordan, Goodkind, Martin) will be able to finish off their long-winded tales as gracefully as Hobb has here.  Even though the 'ending' here took up about a quarter of the book, it was necessary in order to wrap up all the loose ends and reveal the final mysteries of the wonderfully complex world Hobb has created.  The story of Fitz, the Fool, and dragons comes to a close in a beautiful way that leads to a bitter-sweet feeling of conclusiveness.<br /><br />I am content.
B000068TP0|5.0|This Brilliant Star, from Barranquilla, Colombia, Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, is \\"unplugged\\" in the MTV Unplugged -- a format which showcases the artist in a minimalist environment away from a \\"las vegas diva\\" or \\"latin/hip-hop\\" environment, Orginally taped in 1999, pre-\\"Blonding\\", \\"Laundry Service\\", or \\"Hips\\", few may have suggested the artist simply known as \\"Shakira\\" would need to be \\"unplugged\\" (in 2007 climate of \\"Hips Don't Lie,\\" or \\"Wherever, Whenever\\" perhaps unplugging would be in order).      This concert given to an MTV audience is simply sensational!!  The enormous strength of Ms. Mabarek's voice combined with a \\"Grateful Dead\\"-like jam session, gives real pause to the \\"Shakira\\" we are being fed by the Hollywood \\"diva machine\\".  The harmonica in ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?, makes her legit;  \\"Ojos Así\\" puts her on the same plane as Sting's \\"Desert Rose\\".      Shakira is a remarkable, talented, gifted Artist, who is fabulous in this mtv unplugged concert.  The only small regret is \\"Estoy Aqui\\", which is 're-vamped' to favor the then popular  Alanis Morissette.  \\"Estoy Aqui\\", an early hit for Shakira, is a true, sincere, beautiful ballad.  The unplugged version is robotic, forgettable and slightly annoying.     You will enjoy this DVD.  I highly recommend buying; and let's hope for more of the \\"unplugged Shakira\\" in the future.  If \\"La Pared\\" is any indication, I look forward to more fine music from this brillant artist.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|Dear dear me Avril...What the heck have you done here, you've gone from someone who wrote songs with meaning to a total pop flop. I was expecting you to build on what you'd created with your second album but instead you go with this poppy happy go lucky rebel excuse for an album... <br /> <br />You've certainly got \\"Under my skin\\" with disappointment and I'll be sure to \\"Let Go\\" of this CD
B000GW8RX4|5.0|For those who've criticized the video quality...what do you expect? It's 30 years old! For those of us old enough to have seen this edition of the band, the video quality is probably better than our memories of having seen them. As far as the performance goes...it's classic Blackmore, being the center of attention, and if you watch the Bob Daisley and Colin Hart interviews, apparently Blackmore just got out of jail in Vienna immediately prior to the show (evidently he kicked the Vienna promoter in the head, although it sounded like the guy deserved it). Ronnie James Dio shows why he is one of the best rock and roll singers out there, with his outstanding vocal range and diversity...and Powell pounds the skins like the true professional he was (RIP). Add Daisley's use of a pick instead of his fingers on bass, and the competant David Stone on keyboards, and this is as classic a Rainbow lineup as you're likely to find. One small annoyance is that there are times when the camera doesn't seem to be where you might want it to be: at times when Blackmore is shredding his guitar, the camera is on Dio or Powell or, worse, showing an angle from behind the band. This DVD has pretty much the same song selections as their albums On Stage and Live in Germany '76...but then again, these three concert selections were made within about a year of each other, so that's to be expected. It would have been nice to see Stargazer, or Tarot Woman...at least the \\"bonus disk\\" included selections from the Long Live Rock and Roll album, including Gates of Babylon. <br /> <br />All things considered, this is a MUST HAVE for classic rock fans, and those of Blackmore in particular. He is at his self-centered best, and his supporting cast is great. Sit back and prepare to enjoy one of the best rock bands of the '70s...
B00005JPD0|4.0|D&Eacute;J&Agrave; VU is a riveting film about time travel in tandem with crime investigation that works on every level. Tony Scott is back in his element as the top director of intrigue/thrillers. Working with a challenging script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio that asks the viewer to accept the possibility of time travel, Scott is able to make the story work clearly despite the interplay of mixing the viewing of the past form the vantage of the present with placing a character into that past to alter it.<br /><br />The setting is New Orleans, still suffering from the devastation of Katrina,  where a ferryboat explodes killing hundreds of people.  ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought into the investigation of the 'accident' when he discovers elements that suggest the explosion was the act of a terrorist. Agent Pryzwarra (a very fat Val Kilmer) and his team of secretive experts (Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander and Bruce Greenwood) introduce Doug to a highly sophisticated machine that coordinates cameras and heat detectors from satellites and security cameras that is able to mix images and reveal the past - a tricky means of examining a crime scene ex post facto to capture the perpetrators.  Spurred on with Doug's discovery of a beautiful female body (Paula Patton) washed up from the water before the explosion, Doug examines all the evidence, observing the replay of the days leading up to the explosion, and finally asks to be placed in a time machine to return to the scene in hopes of altering the inevitable and unmasking the terrorist (Jim Caviezel).  How this occurs forms the climax of the film, and while many viewers may have trouble swallowing the time travel aspect, the action is so tight and the technique of creating the incident so convincing that few viewers will fail to be wholly involved.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, beginning with Denzel Washington as a terrific lead to the work of Jim Caviezel and all the more minor roles in between.  The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and the cinematography by DP Paul Cameron heighten the tension of this exciting suspense movie.  Grady Harp, April 07zel and all the more minor roles in between.

B000002ADT|5.0|I'm in my 50s. I'd count among my favourite artists Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, The Allman Brothers, Bill Evans, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Keith Jarrett, Townes Van Zandt. My son is 24. He's into a whole lot of stuff, including lots of my music, The Roots, J5, Joan as Policewoman etc. He hates country. One thing we agree on - the greatest album of all time, any genre, is Kind of Blue. Influential? Of course. Groundbreaking? Sure. But its place in history isn't the thing. It's the pure enjoyment you'll get from listening to the music. It's timeless, and it works on any level - as background or loud enough to savour every note, every nuance. Miles, Bill Evans and Trane together - now that's a supergroup. The three never recorded together again, and perhaps that was for the best. They couldn't have surpassed Kind of Blue.

0143036556|1.0|My chief objection to the book is it's poorly written.<br /><br />Authors like John LeCarre can weave a tapestry from many threads; Diamond cant. His material is all over the place and unfocused, and the story has no logical progression. He bit off more than he can chew. And it's dreary reading....if you think reading ought to be enjoyable.<br /><br />On the other-hand, if you like Rube Goldberg Style contraptions, you may enjoy this effort.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Michael Arndt claims to have been inspired by his own family's road trips to write \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"  If that's true, the man needs a hug, stat. <br /> <br />\\"LMS\\" takes a big old bellyflop into a family held together by the barest shreds of convention.  Seething rage and resentment lurks virtually everywhere, but is masked in suburban conformity.  That is, almost every family member lets their resentment show in subtle ways, but is too strait-laced to truly let go.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are marvelous as the unhappily wed parents, while Paul Dano dives into teen angst with relish.  Steve Carell unexpectedly dials it down ten notches as a jilted gay Proust scholar.  If you attended a dinner party with these folks, you'd be on your second bottle of pinot by the time the salad course was finished. <br /> <br />The only two free spirits in the family are Grandpa (Alan Arkin) and Olive (Abigail Breslin).  Grandpa is freed from the strictures of conformity by his age and his drug habit.  Olive is just a wonderful young person, and fortunately the story more or less revolves around her.  Breslin is enchanting as this chubby contented soul bobbing along in this sea of misery.  Without her stellar performance, \\"LMS\\" would be another glum romp through unhappiness like \\"The Squid and the Whale.\\"   <br /> <br />But fortunately, Olive lives.  The family decides to help Olive with her dream of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach.  So the family piles into the infamous yellow VW van and heads off.  Family road trips and Thanksgiving are Hollywood's two favorite excuses for getting families stressed out at each other, and \\"LMS\\" pulls no punches.  Fortunately, the humor is biting, but not savage, and you will laugh more than you will cringe.   <br /> <br />But you'll cringe a lot too. <br /> <br />Occasionally over-written and hyper-clever (marks of a Sundance fave), \\"LMS\\" nevertheless brings the goods.  Fine acting across the board saves the film, and at the end of the day, the Hoover family has restored some dignity and sanity to the world.  Good for them.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Admittedly, I am a sucker for an underdog who achieves excellence.  For example, though I don't care for sports, I love those baseball, basketball, football, soccer movie/true stories that abound these days.  Chris Gardner surmounted unbelievable odds in order to maintain custody  of and provide for his young son. He became a stock market phenomenon. Everytime he was knocked down, he got right back up.  Will Smith was amazing!  *SPOILERS*  The two scenes that touched me the most were when he is holding his sleeping son on the floor of a public restroom where they spent the night, and when he is given the news that he has been chosen from a group of 20 applicants who have worked and studied (for six months without pay) for Dean Witter Investment company. Once again the resiliencey of the human spirit amazes me!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Formed in Iceland in 1994, this collective of Icelandic musicians first delivered their spacey, and atmospheric blend of wintry post-rock, with their 1997 debut \\"Von\\", a sprawling, insular record that moved into darker and more fractured sounds and a sublimely tenuous compositional grasp, than the majority of their peers.  Strange considering that this was roughly around the period in time when bombast rock bands, Hardcore rap, and Dance/Electronica/Trip-hop, and grunge....has established themselves over the last few years.  So, to release a largely contemplative and studied, and by turns simultaneously transcendent and grounded almost introspective album, it seems like a massive folly on the part of the record label.  And although the record initially only did modest sales, at retail....it has over time, began to slowly spread by-word-of-mouth, and although not a title that caused everyone to run out and buy it, those that did, were rewarded with a truly remarkable album. <br /> <br /> <br />Although \\"Von\\" was an album that has now divided listeners with it's slightly unwieldy soundscapes structures (I loved it personally), but what that album did, was test the waters, and ably setup the group up for releasing possibly their finest moment.  The singular and ethereal beauty of \\"Ágætis Byrjun\\".  This is album that is as delicate as it is affecting, an album that is so beautifully ambitious and indulgent, that for a band of 4 musicians from the more remote parts of Iceland, could deliver something so profoundly moving, and hugely epic soundly, is a remarkable achievement in itself.  String sections weave in and out, of deceptively complex arrangements, chamber instruments throb, and flutter around skeletal drums and sepulchral bass, mixed with spectacular orchestrated arrangements, heavy strings, dense lush atmospherics, and vocals which are a made-up language (that the band call \\"Hopelandish\\") which take the form of a highly melodic warbling.  (much like the \\"Cocteau twins\\", earlier work), which to the ear, is a unidentifiable dialect, but in the context of the songs is tremendously evocative.  It's a remarkably soothing experience, whereby the simple verbal names, themes, places, or indeed partial hopes are all mashed down, and liquefied into a largely unintelligible canopy of dreamy sounds capes, and melancholic moods. <br /> <br />In fact, such is the scaled down hypnotic symphonies, and rich, shimmering sonic panoramas, that it can on occasion, become a little too galvanising, as the album has the tendency (if listening to it, in one sitting) to occasionally wash over the listener, and occasionally one track seems to blend into another without the listener largely aware.  But what largely prevents this is the elongated passages of theatrical mood, ambitious emotional extremes, and indulgent crescendos, which provide a suitably ample background for the violins, Cellos, horn sections and even harmonicas, which all manage to sit skilfully on top of the delicate melodies without becoming cluttered or overbearing on each other, and beautifully creating a dynamic sense of gloomy tension one minute, and then passionately rising and soaring the next.  Which is no mean feat in itself, and merely highlights the band completely working together as a unit, and no one musician (or instrument) dominating their performances. <br /> <br />Choosing to review an album now, which was released in 1999, seems like an odd choice...but seeing as I stuck it on after having not listened to it for at least a 2 years.  I was fully reminded of the sheer brilliance of this album.  And such is the sheer brilliance of this record, that I felt compelled to review it, to make anyone that was considering make the purchase that hasn't already, to do so, with a full whole-hearted recommendation.  It's an album that is in equal parts frail and intimate one minute, and ambitious and epic the next, thanks to the progressive arrangements.  It's an album that has the ability to draw in new listeners, for those that hear it for the first time, such is its incredibly emotional engagement, and regardless of whether or not, this is this best album (opinion varies, although this is possibly most-widely recognised as their best work), anyone that doesn't have this extraordinary album as part of their collection, really needs to buy this. <br />

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This James Bond thriller was such a refreshing take on a character that is one of the film industry's great icons. Unlike past films, in which Bond relies heavily on gadgetry and sexual prowess, \\"Casino Royale\\" demonstrates his skill as a highly trained, cold-blooded killer, pure and simple. Give the man a gun, and he'll get the job done. (Actually, the gadget guy \\"Q\\" doesn't even appear in this movie). Also missing from the movie are the tired, cliche megalomaniac heavies who are plotting to overthrow the world (actually, the best one in recent memory was \\"Dr. Evil\\" from the Austin Powers trilogy--Michael Myers completely deflated the pretensions of the power-hungry madman).<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" shows Bond earning his \\"00\\" designation, that is, his famous license to kill at will, after performaing two assassinations. Without giving away too much of the plot, I can only commend the filmmakers for some of the best chase scenes ever put on film, particularly the foot chase that opens the movie.
0425188809|2.0|If you are fairly intelligent, you won't be very impressed by this book. As others have said, the characters are one-dimensional. The hero is too competent. Koontz is way too klutzy in writing about the hero's relationship with the woman--it will actually make you barf if you've ever known a few real women. The dog and the human stalker are by far the most interesting characters, and they are the reason why you may not be able to put the book down. Koontz does have the ability to make you want to keep reading, and that's why I rate this 2 stars instead of just 1. The story has good flow, but the ending is truly awful: It's way too brief and unsatisfying, and it's far too predictable. What a shame. And I thought, \\"this is it? talk about a banal plot!\\" So an enraged baboon is on the loose--who cares? Even the title is stupid and undecipherable. The whole book is so underwhelming, except for the dog. The dog deserves a miniseries!
B00004W221|5.0|I think is one of the most dramatical/educational kind of movies I've ever seen. Once Paul Brown said, \\"You can learn a line of a win, You can learn a book of a defeat\\".

So, we can learn a lot from people that has reached their goals in life based on serious work, effort, honesty and pure heart.
B000LC55F2|5.0|If you want a film that you will not be able to \\"figure out\\" until the very last moment, then this is the movie for you!<br /><br />This is the story of two magicians set in England in the late 1890's.  The two performers are in competition with each other to become the most renowned magician of their time.  Over time, the rivalry becomes increasingly competitive, increasingly bizzare, and even deadly.<br /><br />The actors performances are wonderful and totally convincing.<br /><br />This film has more plot twists than a mountain road.  It will surprse you over and over again.  You will not understand this film until the very last scene is presented, and then you will want to watch it all over again!  It is such a good film that you will enjoy watching it a second time.<br /><br />The \\"dark\\" soundtrack adds so much to the intrigue of this movie.  You will love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a great evening of fun.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig
B00005JPAO|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to watch a movie that receives large amounts of praise. You always feel like your less-than-enthusiastic view of the film will have people proclaiming that you \\"didn't get it and missed the point\\". In the case of the Queen, I felt like it centered on an intriguing time, it had excellent performances yet at the same time, I felt it did have some issues that kept bugging me and while I will recommend the film, it just has too many aspects to it that dragged it down. <br /> <br />It's the end of August 1997 and new Prime Minister Tony Blair, a kind of modernizer who wants to change some of Britain's established rules, is a kind of fish out of water when it comes to etiquette around Queen Elizabeth II. However tragedy strikes when Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a car crash in Paris. The country and the world mourns while the Royal Family remains in their palace without so much as public appearances or issuing statements, preferring to keep it a private matter and not sensationalizing it. The British tabloids have other ideas as they deem it insensitive and stoic so Blair tries to convince the Queen to at least do something in the public before they decide the monarchy is unneeded. <br /> <br />After watching the Queen, 2 things struck me: 1) the huge scrutiny that happens in the British Press and their brutal stories that make the paper and 2) everyone acted really well but the film just didn't sit well with me. Helen Mirren is of course fabulous as the Queen and balances that line between going over-the-top primadonna and unemotional mannequin. When she finally breaks down, she's facing away from the camera as if to say even we aren't allowed to see even an actress playing the Queen cry on-screen. Another highlight was Michael Sheen, playing Tony Blair, who infuses him with a kind of real-world sensability since he's obviously clueless about mannerisms around royalty. Of course the big question is did he really want the Queen to look more favorably to the public or use it as a kind of publicity factory. Who knows. The only one I felt didn't click with me was Prince Charles, Diana's ex. He almost feels opportunistic, like he tries to make things look better in his favor. Maybe it was just me. <br /> <br />The other flaw I felt it had was a sense of a pacing and repetitive tone. Of course it's a character study but in films, there's usually things characters do to bide time and make the scenes feel intriguing. Here, characters just...talk, and not the kind of meaningful talk it should've had. And after awhile you start to notice characters kind of repeat themselves too much in scenes. The Queen tries her hardest to be sympathetic without giving in to changing values, Blair is concerned at the lack of statements from the monarch while Queen's husband expresses non-supportive news in regards to Diana, her attention and what the public wants. After awhile it feels what a friend calls egg-like: whether it's sunny-side up or scrambled or over-easy, it's still egg in the end. Weird analogy I know. <br /> <br />So is it worth a watch? Well many people will enjoy it but for me, I felt it was a well-made but kind of flawed film. Commence \\"you didn't get it\\" remarks.
B000002INJ|5.0|For one reason or another, some people just love to rip in Manowar. Without pointing fingers or getting defensive about it, I'll simply say that either you really understand and respect what they are about, or you just don't get it. <br />\\"Kings of Metal\\" will always have a special place for real Manowar fans. This is largely due to the fact that it's the last record for co-founding member and lead guitarist Ross the Boss. Exactly why he left, I still don't know. However, I think a song like 'Pleasure Slave' might have been part of it. As much of a devoted fan of this band as I am, this has got to be the absolute worst song ever recorded. 'Pleasure Slave' sounds like a song that even Gene Simmons of Kiss would be embarrassed to play. It's listed as a \\"bonus track\\", but it's more of a \\"minus track\\", meaning you will want to make a cd copy of this record and omit this song. <br />The rest of this album is very good stuff though. Very hard-edged, classic style metal that serves as an excelent following to \\"Fighting the World\\", as well as a closing chapter to an era in the Manowar timeline. 'Sting of the Bumblebee' is an excelent bass solo version of the classic piece, 'Flight of the Bumblebee' which calls back to Manowar's first album when Joe Demaio did a version of the William Tell Overture. 'Heart of Steel' is my personal favorite. It embodies the spirit of what Manowar, and their music, is all about. Being outside of the norm. Being singled out. Being made an outcast. Many people have gone through that. I know I have. As the song states: \\"No matter where I stand, I'm ........ alone. - Stand and Fight!  Live by your heart. Always one more try. I'm not afraid to die!!!!\\" Again, either you get it, or you don't. It's hard for me to elaborate on the rest of the songs of this album simply because they all have a unified flavor to them in the tradition of Manowar's subject material. This IS a good thing, despite what others may say. In the end, if you liked \\"Fighting theWorld\\", it's safe to say that you can't miss with this one. Buy it, listen to it, skip over 'Pleasure Slave', and enjoy the last album recorded by a founding member of a band that stuck to their guns and fought to do things they way they wanted to.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|<br />Okay, I stood in line back in the sixties to see DR.NO and sort of was raised on the 'how shocking' entendres of 007. This new mix of un-elegant brute- force Bond just grates on me. Somehow the editing and scripting seem cut of the same non-Seville-Row cloth.  <br /> <br />Now the Bond stories seem much closer to every other spy/chase movie. That is plot, much-too real characters and smaller threats to the world.  <br /> <br />Interesting, within weeks of CR's release used copies of the flick are going for half-price; I think a lot of fans agree with me.
B00005JPAO|5.0|THE QUEEN is a terrific movie. It's one of those rare films that is about a subject that seems mind-numbingly boring but manages to be engrossing and even somewhat suspenseful. The week following the death of Princess Diana found the entire world's eyes on Buckingham Palace and its residents, and this fictionalized version of events seems entirely plausible and utterly fascinating.    Helen Mirren obviously won the lion's share of awards (over thirty, including the Golden Globe, SAG Award and Oscar) for her leading role as HM Queen Elizabeth II. Even though I would rather have seen Kate Winslet (LITTLE CHILDREN) or Penelope Cruz (VOLVER) win the Academy Award, Mirren was excellent in displaying the passions and fears of a woman infamous for her stoicism. Her accent is spot-on (Americans have a hard time telling the difference from one British accent to another) and she looks just like her. Her facial expressions are so acutely in tune with HM's inner life that they're almost too subtle to be noticed, but attentive viewers will marvel at her ability to move audiences without seeming to perform at all.    Director Stephen Frears deserves applause for making this film simultaneously witty and respectful. Though the film obviously assumes that HM Queen Elizabeth II had nothing to do with Diana's death (as many people believe), it's surprisingly even-handed, with many supporting players suspicious of HM and the Queen herself (not to mention her odious husband Prince Philip) expressing distaste for Diana.    THE QUEEN is well worth seeing for its splendid acting (Mirren and Michael Sheen [as PM Tony Blair] are the standouts) and extremely interesting story. Even strict anti-monarchists will find much to love.
B00005JPD0|4.0|This was actualy a pretty decent film.  I was not to upset by any time travel flaws or paradime, the pace of the action was fast enough, and the overall storyline was good. Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent who gets pulled into an investigation of a national tragedy in his home town of New Orleans. During the investigation, he stubles into a top secret crime research tool that allows one to look back exactly 4 days 6 hours into the past.   With a team around him, the plot thickens and twists to a point where he has only one thing left to do.    <br />   Right at the end I find myself slightly wanting to yell at the TV saying \\"do something different\\", but the ending does not quite come out like I thought, and really does fit the storyline.  This is a good flick to rent and watch, but probably not worth buying since it's a one watch film.

B000NQR7NO|5.0|Reading reviews on this site and elsewhere - people are generally claiming that this CD is either no where near as good as the first or way better.  Why?   <br /> <br />Not As Good:  It does not grab you as quickly as the first one did.  It doesn't have some of the tangled poetic wordplay that the first one did.  So it is different and it is its being different that causes the debate. Better:  Brianstorm rocks.  After a few listens however these songs slowly start to creep into your inner ear and stay there.  And, there are some classic custs on here:  Flourescent Adolescent, Only Ones Who Know, This House Is A Circus, Old Yellow Bricks, 505.   <br /> <br />My humble opinion:  One is about as great as the other but the first will remain the masterpiece as it was an album that both introduced a new band and grabbed you by the... <br /> <br />In the spirit of being helpful let me point out a few fantastic b-sides and non album tracks that are some of the bands absolutely best songs: <br /> <br />Bigger Boys And Stolen Sweethearts (I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor) <br /> <br />Temptation Greets You Like A Naughty Friend (Brianstorm) <br /> <br />Who The F*** Are Arctic Monkeys (Who The F*** Are Arctic Monkeys) <br /> <br />Despair In The Departure Lounge (Who The F*** Are Arctic Monkeys) <br /> <br />Leave Before The Lights Come On (Leave Before The Lights Come On) <br /> <br /> <br />Also, The Leave Before The Lights Come On video is a cool concept. <br /> <br />Lastly, go on YOUTUBE and watch the Christmas message the drummer put out last year.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have been reading the occasional item about Planet Earth during production over the previous several years, and had been looking forward to it in a vague kind of way, and was distressed to learn it was airing on the BBC last year, but not here in the U.S.  Unknown to me, the Discovery Channel was wisely using this time to strip off the annoyingly British-accented voice of Sir David Attenborough and replace it for the more-acceptable-to-the-presumed-to-be-stupid American audience with the pleasant but emotionally vacant narration of Sigourney Weaver.  In fact, I like Sigourney Weaver, but I did watch one episode of that version on the Discovery Channel, and it sounded as though she was reading an 8 th grade science report aloud after just having awoken, and without benefit of having actually viewed the show - and certainly not as she narrated, judging by the total absence of intonation relevant to the startling imagery on screen.  Probably not her fault, but I resolved to await the upcoming DVD release, and experience Planet Earth as originally intended (but only, apparently, for those smarty-pants Brits). I'm so glad I did - it is inexpressibly beautiful and a truly singular achievement; absolutely unrivaled in every way possible.
6305907145|1.0|Don't buy this one or even waste time seeing it. A great novel has been distorted almost beyond recognition. The makers of this film did not understand this book at all. The dialogue and the behavior of the characters often seem inappropriately modern.
B000O178BY|2.0|Trent Reznor usually takes 3-5 years to put a new album out. The shorter time period here stands out like a soar thumb. There is very little here that is interesting from a musical standpoint. Very few tracks have any melody at all. Very few tracks have any instruments at all. Not saying that that makes it any less valid as music, but I think the music in the album exists solely for the purpose of presenting the lyrical content in a timely fashion, ie. the beginning of the election campaigns. But there is nothing profound or original here. He has simply become another celebrity jumping on the anti-Bush bandwagon. This album is chock full of cliche. Song structure takes a distant second to the task of whining about everything from rich vs poor, global warming, war, the religious right and George W. Bush himself (not even sutble). I'm frankly tired of the endless rhetoric. Get a life. There are far worse places to live in this world than Bush's America. This album would be a hundred times better without the preachy lyrics.  <br /> <br />For a much better Orwellian themed concept album check out Fear Factory's Obsolete.
0143039431|5.0|If you have not read this book, what are you waiting for?  Is it because it was written before you were born? (1939)  Does its name scare you, as it did me, into imagining it would be about all sorts of odd things, as I did?  Well don't let your preconceived notions fool you.  It's a terrific novel. It is a great piece of literature that won Mr. Steinbeck a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, and eventually, with his other contributions to literature, earned him a Nobel Prize.<br /><br />What can I say about the Joads that has not already been said in the past sixty-odd years?  How could I have missed knowing them earlier?  I read this story, with its \\"country speech\\" and \\"country ways\\" and wanted to take them all in.  I wanted to comfort them all.  I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home.  Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail?  He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have.  Then you meet the 'fambly.'  You live with the 'fambly.'  You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration.  This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land.  The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family.  It fed them, it housed them.  They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before.  When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave.  Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now.  Imagine the dread.  All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \\"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\\"  No talking back, everyone knew their place.  And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.<br /><br />The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California.  Along with 500,000 other displaced people.  All looking for land to work; it's all they know.  You get land, you work it, it's yours.  They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really  going to be like.<br /><br />There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong.  She's the backbone.  She eventually takes charge, which, back on their farm, was unheard of.  Times were changing.<br /><br />Ma & Pa, 6 kids, Grandma & Grandpa, Uncle John, the Preacher Casey, and Connie, the husband of one of Ma's daughters.  Thirteen people in one truck.<br /><br />I wanted to bring them home, let them eat, give them a hot bath, tell them it'll be ok.  I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph.  I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like.  She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7.  I saw humanity at its worse.  Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.  These \\"Okies\\" were treated with contempt.  They were  kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting.  How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?<br /><br />It's a terrific book.  I wish I knew how Noah fared.  I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie.  Is Tom ok?  Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him?  I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong.  If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on.  The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying.  The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free.  The food thrown in rivers, with armed guards making sure no one took the food.  Pigs slaughtered because they could not sell them, and hungry people staring, not understanding that there's a profit to be made.<br /><br />\\"And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listening to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.  In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\\"way food, while these people sit outside the gates dying.

0007205236|4.0|In \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Frank McCourt recalls his childhood after his family move from the U.S. back to their native Ireland, where they live, for the most part, in dire poverty.  When his alcoholic father actually is employed, he takes his paycheck and squanders it in pubs rather than feed and clothe his family.  Mostly though, Frank's family is on the \\"dole\\" (welfare), but even that little amount is eaten up by Frank's father's drinking.  When Frank's mother, Angela, is able to get some of the crumbs, she uses alot of it to buy cigarettes (during one very sad interlude, Angela virtually prostitutes herself to a slightly better off relative).      In the meantime, Frank's infant sister and two little brothers die of lack of nutrition and proper medical care. At certain points in their childhood, Frank and his surviving little brothers have to steal food to avoid starvation, and collect bits of roadside coal and wood to avoid freezing to death.  Although Frank attends a public school, most of the teachers seem more concerned about beating the kids and bad-mouthing the English than actually trying to make a difference in the lives of their desperate students.  Likewise, most of the priests encountered by Frank are more concerned about warning about \\"sinful behavior\\" such as masturbation than providing any help.    The grinding poverty suffered by Frank and his terribly unfortunate family has an extremely strong impact on the reader.  But McCourt manages to keep us entertained, and even laugh a little, even though the cycle of alcoholism and poverty becomes repetitive and depressing. At times, the rather extraordinary recollection of events made me wonder if perhaps McCourt might be embellishing his story in order to generate more drama, such as what Jim Frey did in \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\"  But \\"Angela's Ashes\\" does an admirable job in showing just how bad things could get, how irresponsible parents can be in the face of vices, and how easily those we're supposed to look up to (i.e. teachers and religious leaders) can turn a blind eye to the ills of society.
B000065R0C|3.0|This movie is overrated by people who might have found the movie's concept really really cool. I think this movie doesn't provide much beside its original....(daring)screenplay. Sure, it is nice to watch Lola running through out the movie but I had higher expectations. I am glad that the director was looking for a happy/perfect ending otherwise Lola would be running for eternity.
0800130189|4.0|Viewing \\"Taxi Driver\\" for the first time recently I'm struck by the feeling that I'm seeing it out of context, and that it suffers by my comparison of it to more recent films rather than films that were its contemporaries.  While \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a societal-cultural touchstone I never felt compelled to see it and having seen it now doubt I would rush back to see it again.  That's not to say it's a bad film, but it is difficult viewing.  Director Martin Scorsese certainly captures the nihilism, ambivalence, angst, dislocation, and malaise of the 1970s to a tee.  Having grown up in that era, I remember that all too well, and in that respect \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a depressing drive down a memory lane I'd rather avoid.  The characters also lack nuance or much depth: DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a stereotypical \\"damaged goods\\" Vietnam veteran (which I found profoundly insulting), Peter Boyle's Wizard is a hard-boiled, heat-packing NYC cabbie, Jodie Foster is an equally stereotyped drugged out/addled prostitute, and Harvey Kietel's pimp/hustler borders on an ugly ethnic stereotype you'd only find in a movie of this vintage.  All border on two-dimensional caricatures and are almost over-the-top.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most (and perhaps that was Scorsese's intent) is the amoral ambivalence Scorsese presents here.  Politicians are bland and interchangeable, uttering empty platitudes, government is the problem and the solution, Travis is a psycho and a hero.  The movie is fairly drenched in shades of gray rather than the moral certainties of black and white - and perhaps that's Scorsese's intention.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" was a departure from the Hollywood oeuvre that came before it with obvious heroes and villains.  The end result is a movie that unsettles and causes us to question the nature of good and evil.<br /><br />While \\"taxi Driver\\" is not a movie I'd care to see again anytime soon please don't misconstrue that to mean I didn't think it is not worth seeing, because everyone should see it.  Out of context \\"Taxi Driver\\" is hard to sort out and feels more like camp or a send up of the whole 1970s genre of gratuitously violent films.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is far deeper than that as Scorsese forces us to move beyond our Manichean obsessions over the concepts of good and evil.e everyone should see it.

B000O75F7C|5.0|I listen to far too much Porcupine Tree, if there is such a thing (all of their \\"phases\\"). While FoaBP isn't my favorite of theirs, it's still an amazing production (especially the DVD-A 5.1 version of this disc). \\"Anesthetize\\", or otherwise known as, \\"The Beast\\", is incredible and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. <br /> <br />My only gripe is the somewhat unimaginative lyrics compared to some of their previous albums. A lot of themes are repeated throughout the album (shopping in the mall, MTV, etc...). While this fits the concept of the album, which is that the lyrics come from a young, apathetic teenager, they're still a bit dull compared to Stupid Dream, In Absentia, and Lightbulb Sun. <br /> <br />Please don't get me wrong; this is easily going to be my favorite release of the year and I absolutely love the album. If you're reading these reviews and trying to decide whether to get the album, I'll tell you that you absolutely won't regret it. If you're a first time Porcupine Tree listener, either grab this or \\"In Absentia\\" (followed by \\"Stupid Dream\\", \\"Deadwing\\", and \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" if you can find it). If you're more into a Pink Floydian (or, psychedelic) style of music, check out \\"Stars Die: The Delirium Years\\", which is a \\"greatest hits\\" of their earlier, more psychedelic stuff (the album makes it easy to pick and choose which albums to buy next based on the song styles). <br /> <br />The wonderful thing about this band is that you'll notice something new about the music on your 80th listen through.
0143038419|2.0|This book was recommended to us by several people because one of us is Balinese (the other of us is American) and we live a good deal of every year in the part of Bali Ms.Gilbert writes about. <br /> <br />Ms.Gilbert has a witty style, reminiscent of an Erma Bombek, and we enjoyed many of the descriptions of life in Bali. But her wittiness doesn't excuse her sloppiness:  <br /> <br />Some examples: 1. Apparently while in Bali she failed to learn how to pronounce the name most Balinese have: Wayan, pronounced Why-On, not Why-Ann as she writes. 2. The ceremony she describes where a baby first touches the ground is a 3-month, not a 6-month ceremony. 3. Bali and Lombok lie 8 degrees below the equator, not exactly on it as she writes.  <br /> <br />True, none of these are very important errors but it points out the underlying theme of Ms. Gilbert's book: a book about herself. This self-centered western attitude is so pervasive, and we must say, particularly among the ex-pat community around Ubud, Bali, that we studiously avoid contact with them whenever possible. They're always complaining about the Balinese and how beneath the friendly veneer they're just a bunch of greedy, 2-faced hypocrites. Ms.Gilbert makes a big deal about how she \\"purchased\\" a house for her needy friends in Bali, but we hear little about what she received in return.   <br /> <br />We think for a New Yorker, perhaps the most selfish & greedy culture on Earth (where else but NY's JFK Airport do you have to PAY for a baggage cart in the International Arrival hall?) to criticise the Balinese, one of the most generous on earth, is really pathetic. This is a memoir of a spoiled whiny American. Me me me and more about me...Ho hum.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Terry Gilliam (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) takes a typical \\"time travel\\" theory and twists it into one heck of a psychological thriller. The premise of the movie is rather interesting (if you're into sci-fi). Cole (Bruce Willis) is in the future (30 or so years?) in a world where only 1% of the population lives - all underground. He's imprisoned for random acts of violence we're slightly hinted towards in a dark, gloomy, odd underground Philadelphia prison. He is hand picked by the top scientists of the underground world to travel back in time to 1996 to gather information on the super-virus that was released in December 1996 by the army of the 12 Monkeys. Unfortunately he is sent back to 1990 Baltimore and finds himself put into a mental institution because, lets be honest, anybody that randomly shows up and is going on about collecting information about the virus that wipes out 5 billion people is obviously going to be thought to be a little nuts. At the institution he runs into Jeffrey (Brad Pitt) who is very insane (Oscar-nominated role in this movie) and \\"befriends\\" Cole as eventually helps him escape. In the process, Cole's psychiatrist Kathryn (Madeleine Stowe) feels an odd connection with him on a more spiritual level. She is convinced she knows him from somewhere. To speed it up, he goes back to the future and then goes BACK to 1996...there the story goes on...    All throughout, the movie takes Cole and twists his (and your) mind and starts to make him (and you) doubt if his \\"time-travel\\" experiences have actually happened...or was he just really insane. The movie is pretty straight forward in making it clear that he did go back in time, but you really go \\"or did he?\\" the whole time. It is really cool how everyone plays together and ties together. It twists your mind a lot, and you'll be biting your nails the whole time trying to figure out what will happen. The whole \\"dream\\" sequence that is seen throughout finally comes together at the end and its a CLASSIC \\"Wow....\\" scene. I have to say it was the coolest twist on modern sci-fi mind thrillers to date.    If you've seen the movie The Prestige, you'll see some similarities...some.    I'm Will Black, and thats my review of 12 Monkeys.     5/5 Stars
B000MNP2KI|5.0|....whether its his/her favorite Bond film or whether its his/her favorite Bond actor, there is bound to be disagreement.  <br /> <br />I will admit that this was the first Bond film I had ever seen. You're probably shaking your head at this point wondering why a self-proclaimed \\"movie-buff\\" hadn't seen a Bond film in her 28 years of life, but I just hadn't. I tend to avoid the big Hollywood Blockbuster movies (ie. Batman, Superman, Spiderman etc.) and am typically more into independent and/or \\"artsy\\" films, but I do enjoy good action/adventure as well. Not to say Bond films fall into the Hollywood Blockbuster category, however, the ones made in the last decade or so have been hyped up by Hollywood with much with so much pomp and circumstance, its actually kept me away from the theater. <br /> <br />Regardless, I decided to \\"cave in\\" and rent Casino Royale when home for two weeks with pneumonia simply because I had exausted every other film in Blockbuster Video, and I was extremely surprised and impressed with the movie, so much so that I have now rented and seen most of the earlier Bond films. At this juncture, I feel I can finally submit my opinion that Daniel Craig IS the ultimate Bond! He was much more subtle than the other actors who played the coveted role, and defintiely much more manly, believeable and \\"cool\\" than Pierce Brosnsan who starred in the last few ones.  <br /> <br />The film was awesome (for lack of a better word): amazing special effects, quality acting, a great plot and twists and turns galore....pretty much a perfect movie (let alone a perfect \\"Bond movie\\").  <br />Despite being the first Bond film I've seen, its defintiely my favorite and I can't wait for Bond 22 (as yet untitled, I believe) to come out with Daniel Craig.  <br /> <br />I HIGHLY recommend owning this amazing film and adding it to your Bond collection- its worth every penny and then some!
B00005JPD0|4.0|Deja Vu is a very interesting take on the time travel spectrum directors, writers, and producers alike are all interested in. Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Enemy of the State) once again goes with Denzel Washington to boost his movie. If it weren't for Denzel's supurb acting, I'd give the movie 3, maybe 2 stars. Putting aside the silly time-travel lingo tossed around throughout, the movie itself has strong performances and good action/supsense...that's all if you're able to set aside the time travel idea. It IS a pretty far-fetched way to do the whole time travel thing. Movies should just assume you accept time travel, and spare the viewers a long, detailed explanation of how it actually works when everyone is just sitting there scratching their heads trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about. Adam Goldberg's character is our science geek who goes on for a good couple minutes giving a very vague explanation on their time travel conception.  <br /> <br />Tony, spare us! Just assume we're ok with your time travel device and don't try to explain it...but, I understand why you would have to. Denzel is a question man in this movie, and boy he was so good in this movie. I love a good Denzel role (which I'm sure most of you do too), and his character is basically the reason this movie did well at the box office, and the reason I (along with many others) bought the dvd.  <br /> <br />So, the whole time, Denzel and co. are trying to figure out how to go BACK in time to stop a terrorist (Jim Caviezel) before he blows up a loaded New Orleans faire boat (which is shown at the beginning of the movie). In the procces, gorgeous new commer Paula Patton is tossed in the mix of the whole bomb act, and thus Denzel forms an attachment to her, and is determined to go back in time to rescue her before she dies as she originally died in the beginning, but he wants to go back and prevent it (ahh, mind boggling huh?).  <br /> <br />I know this sounds super Sci-Fi ish, but its really more of a romantic action thriller. The sci-fi aspect is overshadowed by strong performances by Denzel, Caviezel, and Patton. I think as viewers, you'll really enjoy this movie a lot by putting aside the sci-fi aspect and watching it for its suspense and thrills. I think Tony should stray away from trying to do far-fetched sci-fi from here on out and just stick to his high-octaine action thrillers...and use Denzel because as far as Im concerened, he's one of the strongest actors in Hollywood as of now. Pretty good plot, decent sci-fi aspect, great thrills, and awesome performances make up this movie. <br /> <br />I'm Will Black and that's my review of Deja Vu <br /> <br />4/5 Stars
B000N6U0E2|1.0|Like others have reviewed, and as mentioned in the product description, this DVD may NOT be compatible with your DVD player.  I tried three different discs (all brand new) and none of them played on my Harman Kardon DVD 25 player. <br /> <br />Looks like I have to start renting ALL Sony DVDs before buying. <br /> <br />I'm sure it was a good movie though....everyone is talking about it.  :(
0375701427|5.0|First and foremost about AMERICAN PASTORAL, Philip Roth can tell a compelling story.  He strikes a firm, urgent rhythm in the narrative voice and information ordering that swoops the reader up and down the architecture of plot. He creates profoundly real characters who embody much of the American experience as well as universal Biblical themes.  This is an incredible achievement. It makes for hugely satisfying reading. <br /> <br />Roth introduces his story through the eyes of his notoriously recurring protagonist, writer Nathan Zuckerman.  The occasion of his 45th high school reunion in his old Newark, NJ neighborhood yields profound and touching observations about the human need for reunions, especially at an age when more and more classmates appear in the in memoriam pages.  The trip home also reminds Zuckerman of his own local hero, a friend's older brother, the embodiment of the successful American student, football star, military hero and business man, the child of Jewish immigrants who out performs Waspish old blood at every turn, including looks-- the Swede.  In a moment that cuts through the camaraderie of the reunion, Zuckerman learns that the Swede's life was not the iconic pastoral everyone thought.  As he stares into the gauzy scene of swaying figures on the dance floor, a vision of what must have happened takes hold. <br /> <br />And thus begins the third person story of Swede's fall from grace.  He is not a bad man, he has earned his way good naturedly and thoughtfully, taking his responsibility to others seriously.  He is dealt, however, a child who inexplicably becomes caught up in the violence of the 1960's, whose act of protest destroys her family and shatters the personal and collective American dream.  Roth gets it all right, history, family and cultural psychology, and the nature of perception and tragedy.  Wow. <br />
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Along with \\"Ball of Fire\\", they are the two best screwball comedies in American film history. The most talented director of this genre: Howard Hawks, and the greatest duo to come out of Hollywood's star system: Katherine Hepburn & Cary Grant. They play so well that by the middle of the film one almost forgets what the story was all about, and just follows the pair wherever they go. This kind of excentric, but delicious story, could only function with great actors like them; actually, I don't imagine anybody else doing it. It was 1938 and comedies never got any better.<br /><br />The second disc is very good. It has 2 documentaries. One on Howard Hawks, with valuable interviews and scenes from some of his films. His comments on some movies, like one of Peckinpah's and 'High Noon' are worth listening to, and I agree with them absolutely. The sad thing is that 3 of his greatest films or not even mentioned: Hatari, His Favorite Sport & Ball of Fire. The other documentary is on Cary Grant. Longer, about an hour and a half (the one on Hawks was only 50 minutes), and pretty good too; only a little too focused on his private life.
0767834739|3.0|When I first rented the original \\"Resident Evil\\" I was completely shocked at how much I liked it.  I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).<br /><br />Now we have \\"Resident Evil- Apocalypse\\".  Don't get to see \\"grown-up\\" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of \\"made-for-cable\\" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.<br /><br />But wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.<br /><br />Cinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first \\"Star Wars\\" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not \\"Lucas-Time\\").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!<br /><br />I can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.  Just don't go in with the same expectations.f events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.

B00006GO9Q|5.0|This is, far and away, the best of Miles' fusion albums. Now, I'm generally not a fan of the fusion stuff - I see Bitches Brew as tepid and lackluster with a couple shining moments (title track, Miles Runs the Voodoo Down, John McLaughlin), Jack Johnson as half a masterpiece (Right Off rules) and half a bore (Yesternow... grrgh...), Live-Evil as assorted wankery (though What I Say is great), and On the Corner as a disaster, albeit a gutsy one. Now, In a Silent Way... that's a whole different free type of burger. A bigger, better, MUCH juicier burger.<br /><br />What sets this apart? For one, the number of musicians. There are eight guys here, and a small army on every other album I mentioned. Eight guys contribute ideas MUCH better than a small army. Especially if Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter and Miles himself are five of those eight guys. Hell, sneak in Ron Carter on bass and you've got the Second Great Sextet (first being the Kind of Blue band) on your hands. I know that Miles, Shorter, McLaughlin and Hancock played pivitol rows on Bitches Brew, but in a less crowded setting, they communicate better and their contributions come to the fore. Oh, and Tony Williams is my favorite drummer in the history of ever, and he left after this album, so maybe that relates to the huge drop in quality, I don't know. But even Joe Zawinul (who I'm not a fan of) and Chick Corea (who I have no opinion on) work magic on their keyboards. Basically, the only guy who DOESN'T make an amazing contribution is Dave Holland, who perfectly conforms to the stereotype of the bassist as being \\"random guy who nobody's heard of and doesn't draw attention to himself in his playing\\". He's just the bassist.<br /><br />This is a haunting, restrained, atmospheric affair. The volume and tempo rarely pick up, and if they do it's only briefly (i.e. that quick little blurb in the middle of the title suite). It's an eerie calm this one gives off, like Kind of Blue (which is god) on downers. Moody, reflective Miles has always been some cool stuff, and this is no exception. Shorter's soprano is ethereal and creepy - in good senses of both terms. And John McLaughlin is, well... John McLaughlin. If you've never heard his work, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />Two beautiful, otherworldly twenty-minute suites... Miles fans should be in heaven. Oh, and the cover would make a cool t-shirt. I'd buy it, at least.downers. Moody, reflective Miles has always been some cool stuff, and this is no exception.

B00005JNQS|3.0|With a cast of some very big actors and actresses, \\"Robots\\" had a tonne of potential. As a growing fan of animated movies, I was really looking forward to seeing this one, especially after some of the advertising shorts looked so good. While I rather enjoyed the movie, it did not \\"wow\\" me as others had done.<br /><br />The animation is not an attempt to compete with the likes of Pixar, and the different style really works well for the movie. The detail is excellent, the characters all come off well, and the movie has a good overall texture to it. All in all, the animators crafted the movie exceptionally well.<br /><br />In the humour side, there is some for the adult audience, such as when Rodney's father misses the \\"delivery\\" and his mum makes a comment that the fun is in \\"making the baby\\". Apart from once or twice, I do not recall much else along the same lines. The likes of [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] has a lot more of the references to other films and so on for the adults.<br /><br />Having said that, a lot of the humour is quite funny, mostly from the different characters and their ways. Robin Williams is particularly deserving of mention, as his charm and style with animations comes right on through, perhaps more than other characters.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Robots\\" is a good film, and certainly worth having a look. I enjoyed a lot, but I am not sure I would want to sit through multiple viewings like I have with other movies of the same genre.

0393327655|4.0|\\"You will not question the religious beliefs of others, just as you do not question your own religious beliefs.\\"<br /><br />\\"You will respect the religious beliefs of others, just as you respect your own religious beliefs.\\"<br /><br />These two unuttered commandments swarm through the mind of any political correct, 21st century human being.  Sam Harris, in his book \\"The End of Faith, Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\\" (EOF), challenges us to understand the danger inherent in the seemingly benign assumption that all religions and all beliefs are created with equal validity.  With flowing, elegant prose that would humble even P. G. Wodehouse, Mr. Harris takes us on a tour of the nature of belief, horrors conducted in the name of religion, the origins of morality, and the human need for spirituality.  However, his idea of spirituality is one which does not depend on old tomes filled with improbable tales, men extolling time-honored myth-traditions, or omniscient deities responsible for both the punishing and forgiving of sins.<br /><br />In the first two chapters, Harris argues that even those believers classified as \\"moderate\\" are at least as dangerous, perhaps even more so, than their fundamentalist brethren.  Most readers probably initially react to this statement by thinking it a remarkably counterintuitive conclusion, but the author has more to say.  He states that, to be intellectually honest, one's beliefs must reflect how the world actually is.  Since the central tenets of religion require no proof, only faith, for them to be believed, absolute faith means that one can potentially justify almost any action which is nevertheless totally ungrounded in reality.  Harris argues that, if anything, fundamentalists are those that are truly devout, because they are interpreting the letter and word of their faith in totality, not merely \\"cherry-picking\\" those beliefs which are politically or culturally expedient.  If these \\"moderates'\\" beliefs are respected, how can one simultaneously not respect the beliefs of fundamentalists?  Mr. Harris argues that, with both moderates and fundamentalists, beliefs about the world are reached in extraordinary ways:  with faith and with no consideration for reality.  If you respect the beliefs of the moderate, then you must also respect the beliefs of the fundamentalist; his argument suggests the stunning conclusion that religious moderates provide a sort of \\"belief cover\\" for fundamentalists, who, enabled, will continue to visit acts of madness upon the world.<br /><br />The third chapter casts a less-than-appealing glow on the history of Christianity.  With many examples, he discusses the Inquisition, witch-trials, and religiously-inspired pogroms against Jews.  He finds it fascinating that torturers, who inflicted unspeakable physical pain to obtain \\"confessions\\" from \\"infidels\\", could yet sleep at night confident that they have served God.  To those who would argue political motive, Harris responds that these habits of medieval Christians--that of revealing a neighbor as \\"witch\\" or \\"heathen\\" and cheering at the subsequent burning--are simply extreme examples of what occurs when persons of faith interpret the Bible literally.  Modern-day Christians may scoff at these activities, classifying them as barbaric ignorance; however, Harris states that these tortures were only the end-point logical conclusion of direct Biblical interpretation.  Deuteronomy 13:12-16, as illustrated by Harris, is explicitly clear in its instruction to investigate heathenism, to then put those found guilty to the sword, and to burn all of the heathen's possessions.<br /><br />The fourth chapter discusses Islam.  In the wake of the horrors of 9/11, media, politicians, and clergymen worldwide were quick to state that Islam was a \\"religion of peace\\".  Mr. Harris argues--via scathing commentary of Islamic tenets and doctrines--that nothing could be further from the truth.  He goes on to argue that suicide bombers and those puppetmasters who control them, are killing themselves and innocent bystanders not out of poverty, political ideation, or the furtherance of their tribe's/nation's success, but because they actually believe what they say they believe (i.e.,  virgins will be waiting for them, Allah desires the death of the infidel).  This argument is stunning in its ramifications, as the consensus opinion is that suicide bombers are serving some \\"more mortally-bound\\" purpose with their self-destruction.  \\"They don't really believe that stuff\\" is an uncomfortably common reaction to the activities of these suicidal madmen and one, in Harris' view, which may ultimately contribute to the destruction of all civilization.  Western minds, Harris argues, are simply seeking to rationalize the behavior of these suicide-bombers via the desperate search for proxy reasons which do not exist.  According to Harris--in this age of weapons of such power that one individual can kill thousands along with himself--it is massively irresponsible to interpret these fundamentalists' rants as anything less than precisely what they believe.<br /><br />The remainder of EOF finds Harris discussing more esoteric subjects:  the origin and nature of morality, the human hunger for \\"more\\", the definition of \\"self\\", and the search for truth via meditation.  Mr. Harris is currently studying for an advanced degree in the field of neuroscience; this discipline permeates much of his writing, sometimes to the degree where one wonders if perhaps he relies on its precepts overmuch.  However, the human mind is precisely the thing one needs to understand should we continue in our search for the \\"ultimate and absolute\\" ethical code, Harris argues.  His arguments guide us towards his belief that, barring insufficient research, eventually humanity will discover the universal moral code which comes, not from the Bible, Koran, or any text, but from within the recesses of the human brain.  He concludes the book with a novel, and consciousness-raising, view of the modern perception of torture before closing with a discussion on the necessity of meditation.<br /><br />Throughout \\"The End of Faith\\", Harris states the requirement for consistency:  in our beliefs, in our moral certitudes, in our perception of barbarism, and in our doling out of tolerance.  His belief, that we must be intellectually honest in all things, rings true regardless of the ultimate practicality of such a stance.  Sam Harris is a clear thinker who communicates his arguments in brilliantly-arranged writing which is a joy to read.  His skill at raising one's consciousness is nearly unparalleled.  The text is littered with endnote references, some of which, lacking brevity, could be designated chapters themselves.  His bibliography list is extensive, with well over 250 entries begging the reader's further attention.<br /><br />This book is a fascinating read, which challenges the reader to think about the future role of religion in the world.

B00005JPPI|3.0|\\"Fracture\\", the new film from director Gregory Hoblit (\\"Primal Fear\\", TV's \\"L.A. Law\\", \\"NYPD Blue\\"), is a pretty routine legal thriller with four attributes that help it stand out from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), an aerospace tycoon, sits at his desk working on a new Rube Goldberg contraption when he suddenly realizes he should leave the office. He shows up at a local hotel and finds his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) having an affair with Rob (Billy Burke, \\"Ladder 49\\", TV's \\"24\\"), a detective with the Los Angeles police force. When Jennifer returns home, Ted confronts her and shoots her. Later, Rob is the detective called to the scene. When he realizes his girlfriend has been killed, he attacks Ted. At trial, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling, \\"Half Nelson), a deputy DA with one foot out the door for a private practice job, is reluctant to take the case until he learns there is a signed confession. He convinces the district attorney (David Strathairn) that he can close the case in the two weeks he has left, keeping his conviction rate and new job intact. Willie, a man with a lot of debt, anxious to get going on his new high salary position, takes the case and soon meets his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamunde Pike, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Die Another Day\\"), who seems to be attracted to her new Junior Associate. But Willie is cocky and assumes this is a slam-dunk until he starts to learn Ted's strategies to win the trial.<br /><br />\\"Fracture\\" is a pretty routine legal thriller centered on a `brilliant mind' who will manipulate everyone around him in an effort to go free. The one person standing in his way? A younger `brilliant mind'.<br /><br />There are four factors that set \\"Fracture\\" apart from the rest of the pack. The first, and least significant of the four, are Hoblit's efforts to shoot this film in a very lush style, making it an almost beautiful film to watch. Hoblit worked on many of Steven Bocho's television series and the style is similar to \\"L.A. Law\\" or \\"Murder One\\". All of the surfaces gleam with polish, shadows are heavy and dark, and figures are frequently seen from behind screens or in shadow. Sunlight also seems to play a major influence on all of the cinematography. Often, characters are walking through hallways and we see the glow of early afternoon light trying to break through the dusty passageways or reflecting off marble surfaces. This technique helps to give the film a rich look, even beyond the general lifestyle of Hopkin's character, who is rich and lives in a nice, modern house. This technique helps to give Gosling's office at the District Attorney's office a rich look, even though the office is cramped, unglamorous and very different from Ted's lifestyle.<br /><br />The other three factors are the talent of three actors involved in the film. First and foremost is Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins has played this type of role before, the brilliant mastermind, but he does it so well. There are and will be inevitable comparisons between this role and Hannibal Lecter (both are brilliant, both are deadly, both play mind games with a young `prot&eacute;g&eacute;') and Ted Crawford is Hannibal - light. But it is always interesting to watch a master like Hopkins, even when he is lobbed a softball like this role. Crawford, an aeronautical engineer, likes to create elaborate rube Goldberg contraptions, with long metal chutes, allowing Crawford to place a metal ball at the top and watch it move through a series of passages, all connected, much like a large version of the game \\"Mousetrap\\". When he realizes his wife is cheating on him, he decides to shoot her and comes up with a way to get through all of the legal challenges and hurdles. Presumably, studying these contraptions helps him work through all of the possible variations.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Hopkins manages to add some nice touches to the role, making him seem even more devious and menacing. During a character'stestimony, Crawford, who has chosen to represent himself, doodles on a yellow legal pad, periodically ripping the pages from the pad. Each time he tears off a sheet, the sound reverberates through the quiet courtroom, causing Beachum to turn his attention to the defendant.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling does a great job as Willie Beachum, the Assistant District Attorney who gladly accepts a high paying job at one of the most respected law firms in Los Angeles. Beachum is cocky and trying to move beyond his roots; he grew up poor in Oklahoma and now has a load of debt from law school. He clearly always saw the District Attorney's office as a stepping-stone and is now glad to be leaving it. When he meets with his boss (played by David Strathairn), a comment is made about Willie's high conviction rate and the lengths he would go to get it. Willie is a complicated guy and not beyond inflating the truth or maneuvering things to benefit his goals.<br /><br />When he meets his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamunde Pike), he is instantly attracted to her and they flirt. This is yet another example of his cockiness, because he knows he is good looking and doesn't care if he flirts with his new boss. The fact that this leads to the film's biggest plot hole is beyond the point. because he is so brazen about it, this adds significantly to his character.<br /><br />He strides into the courtroom and decides to prosecute Ted's case, despite his impending new job, because he considers it a slam-dunk. Ted signed a confession, there was no one else in the house, and how could he lose? Then, Ted begins to pull the strings and manipulate everything and everyone.<br /><br />To a lesser extent, David Strathairn adds significance as District Attorney Lobruto, Willie's boss. From the moment Lobruto walks into Beachum's office to confront him, we see that Lobruto has world-weariness to him. As an elected public official, he is aware of what little he can accomplish and accepts everything else with ease. He has been beaten down by the system and takes his young Assistant DA's defection with the slightest disgruntlement. But he understands. If he had the same chance, he would probably take it.<br /><br />Embeth Davidtz, Rosamunde Pike, Billy Burke, Bob Gunton and Fiona Shaw all play supporting characters, some with greater success and greater impact, but they all add to the texture of the story, making it interesting to watch.<br /><br />\\"Fracture\\" is not a great film, but it is fun to watch all of the twists and turns, the machinations Hopkins' character puts everyone through. For it to be a great film, Hopkins would have to add something different to his character. Is it just me or does it seem odd that Crawford is playing mind games with a poor guy from the South, who came from a questionable background? Does Beachum's background sound familiar to anyone else? Did they ask Jodie Foster to take the role before she refused it because it was too similar to Clarice Starling?

B000002OR4|5.0|Schindler's List has long been regarded as one of the finest films ever created and I will not dispute this one iota.  For anyone that appreciates this film, it can easily be said as well that its success owes much thanks to the incredible score by John Williams.  The main them is simple yet will be one of those few works that gives you goosebumps and chills you to the core.<br /><br />If you appreciate classical music, love scores, or just feel the Schindler's List is a moving masterpiece, you owe it to yourself to listen to Williams work and make sure to have the Kleenex by your side.<br /><br />A masterpiece in film scoring that few composers have ever come close to achieving.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I just didn't like this movie, despite it has some of my favorite actors and actress (Jolie). They all do their jobs well but the story never picks up, it's slow, boring, and filled with cliches (oh by the way she is pregnant; oh no, really?!--compare this to the pregnancy dilemma in \\"The Last King of Scotland\\"). It doesn't show or tell anything we can't guess, nor care. If I were a betting man, Damon probably didn't like this script; but because De Niro is behind the project he probably gave it the green light. Jolie probably needed the money to adopt more kids. This movie is perfunctory at best.

B000AP04L0|5.0|'Office Space' bombed at the box office in February 1999, pulling in only $10,827,810 domestically according to Box Office Mojo.  It limped into what appeared to be oblivion after six scant weeks.  Except for one small thing...<br /><br />...in DVD/home video-land, 'Office Space' became a cultural phenomenon.  As one reviewer notes, Mike Judge's workplace masterpiece \\"promptly broke every video record in Fox history.\\"  And eight years after its release it continues to be a phenomenon.  In retrospect, the big screen release was terribly mis-marketed.  Count me among the many who bypassed it in the theater because I couldn't make heads or tails out of the ads.<br /><br />Judge's film is set in a 'nameless Texas city,\\" but this is clearly Dallas.  For those of us that have lived in that city - the corporate home of TGI Friday's and its flair-bedazzled employees - there are inside laughs by the bucketful, including the back-to-back apartments with paper-thin walls, the massive traffic pile-ups on 635 (LBJ), Initech's classic Dallas office space, etc.<br /><br />Great performances here:  Mike Judge's (uncredited) cameo as Jennifer Aniston's flair-obsessed manager; David Herman's fantastic turn as Michael Bolton (no relation); and John C. McGinley's excellent portrayal as a workforce consultant (he delivers the movie's most memorable line: \\"This straight shooter has upper management written all over him.\\")
B000E1155E|4.0|The Monkeys survived all of the immense hype that preceded  \\"Whatever People Say...\\", produced a stellar debut record, received well-earned plaudits from both the press and the public and then released a disappointing sophomore effort and disappeared from view. Not on your Nelly! Contrary to the expectations (and hopes) of many within and without the music business the band has produced for us all a worthy successor.<br /><br />Favourite Worst Nightmare, while clearly an Arctic Monkeys record, is different from the initial cd. Lyrically and musically this new recording evidences the band's continued growth into maturity. And why not?  A hell of a lot has happened to the band over the last eighteen months. They have visited us here in Toronto on three different occasions - they have done a lot of hectic touring. They have been exposed to the world outside Sheffield and the music shows it. It is no longer just pubs and fights and the like. The record kicks of with a couple of faster, louder tracks and then settles down. The music is witty, urgent, surprisingly melodic and quite simply the best thirty-seven minutes of indie-pop that I've heard so far this year.

B000002UB3|5.0|A few biased notes: It's that side two. The way it sweeps through with a perfect logic - along with a truly rocked-out sound in parts (yet it somehow stays \\"clean,\\" clean raunch-rock!). Also, even the disjointed lyrics seem to fit. Every part drops into place as if divinely ordained. The call-and-response leads, the shouted-in \\"extra\\" vocal exclamations, the changes in tempo, Ringo's superb, thumping-along drum solo. What an integration. Someone had his instinct and his solid musical knowledge working in harmony just right. I've been studying Harold Klemp's teachings about dreams and divine spirit. I had a really up, open-hearted dream about Road recently. I woke up joyful - perhaps after an inner confirmation that \\"All is  well in the worlds of God.\\" That some works of art can help lift the consciousness far and wide. Like Beethoven and Mozart and Faure, whom I listen to most of the time.  <br />     Anyway, Road is a beautiful classic for anyone who knows the Beatles' sound!
B0009A1AS2|1.0|I ordered the disc when it came out.  Listened to it, and hated it.  I put it away for a while, and pulled it out recently.  It still sucks.  This band has been going down since 6DOIT.  I loved I&W and Awake.  Both Amazing discs.  When Awake came out, I couldn't stop playing it for months.  This is just crap. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the real DT, and you haven't already done so, get your hands on a copy of JP's Suspended Animation.  Now that CD rocks.
0143038419|5.0|(Available in hardcover and paperback) <br /> <br />Elizabeth Gilbert's prose evokes images and emotions that bring her readers along for the journey. Eat Pray Love is Gilbert's memoir of the year she spent traveling and living in Italy, India, and Indonesia following a divorce and crippling depression. <br /> <br />A desire to learn Italian prompted the four-month move to Italy and language school. The depression lifted as Gilbert made friends and ate pasta and pizza. Her language skills grew as she learned to enjoy life and food and pleasure again. The next four months, at an Ashram in India, were spent in prayer and meditation. Gilbert struggled against the disciplines of the Ashram before embracing them and discovering the freedom such strictures bring. The last third of the year spent in Bali, was devoted to balance. Gilbert studied with traditional Balinese healers, discovered her own strength, and found love. <br /> <br />Gilbert peels back layers of her heart, soul, and mind to reveal the fear, hunger, and need that reside in all of us. She is brutally honest, yet careful to assure the reader that although she is chronicling the human journey, it is most certainly her own. She protects the privacy of others whose paths have intersected with hers. <br /> <br />Gilbert's writing is lovely and powerful and reminiscent of Anne Lamott, who coincidentally provides a cover endorsement. At the conclusion of Eat Pray Love, Gilbert can speak Italian with ease, has \\"sat upon God's palm,\\" in India, and found connection in Bali. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: One woman's fascinating journey out of depression and back into life again.
0316113077|5.0|I don't like to cook, and I don't like to bake. What I do like is reading/studying cookbook recipes and partaking in the mouthwatering delicacies that inhabits the pages of cookbooks. And if it's a cookbook that features cookies, cakes and cupcakes--all the better. <br /> <br />Confetti Cakes Cookbook is a gift from Elisa Strauss of New York City's famed bakery Confetti Cakes. This cookbook is a work of art where Strauss divulges her secrets for creating mouth-watering, unique confections. And she offers projects for every skill level. <br /> <br />The cookbook is divided into sections. You won't want to miss the equipment and techniques portion, especially if you're a beginner. Strauss then moves on to basic recipes, cookies, cupcakes, mini cakes, and finally cakes. <br /> <br />The inclusion of the equipment and tools necessary to complete a project makes it easy for a neophyte like me to be prepared and be successful. I found the glossary helpful and wouldn't be able to accomplish anything without the detailed tips and techniques. <br /> <br />I love all things sweet, but if they're brown (chocolate), I am in heaven. The Red Velvet Cake is scrumptious, and the chocolate cookies make a nice 'chaser.' There are cookies for every occasion and the photographs are an added bonus. I am determined to bake the Dice Mini Cakes. We are awaiting the birth of a new grandchild; and the Baby Blocks Cake is perfect for a baby shower. And if you've overdone the sweets, try the Sushi Cake. Who knew? <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: A perfect cookbook for those everyday and special occasions. It's a keeper.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|With her third studio release, Avril Lavigne seems to be continuing on the superstar's path that she found herself on way back in 2002 with the single \\"Complicated.\\"<br /><br />The biggest difference is, as Lavigne has grown up, we've also seen her grow as an artist. In many of the tracks from her newest release \\"Best Damn Thing,\\" the music plays out with the sounds and lyrical style she's become known for. But, there are also a number of tracks with a new and interesting twist.<br /><br />Probably the best songs an the album are \\"Runaway,\\" \\"Innocence,\\" Girlfriend\\" and \\"Contagious.\\" These range from featuring strong beats and the typical Avril style (\\"Runaway\\"), to soft and powerful ballads (\\"Innocence\\"), to more fun and energetic sounds (\\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"Contagious\\").<br /><br />But as with just about any album, there are a few songs that don't quite stand out among the rest.<br /><br />Her least impressive effort by far is \\"I Don't Have to Try,\\" featuring what seems to be some sort of experiment gone wrong. \\"Keep Holding On\\" and I Can Do Better\\" are a bit to basic and mechanical respectively.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Best damn Thing\\" is yet another good showing by a truly talented young lady who likely has many years of a solid career ahead of her.<br /><br />I'd rate this album 3.5 out of 5 or a solid B.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Time machines are not exactly a new and untested device in movie history. They come as 'serious' science fiction following H.G.Wells, or as hilarious comedy (which works well for Back to the Future), or as outrageous chaos, like the Butterfly movie; and this one, Deja Vu, may be the first terror thriller using it. I did not expect it to work, but it does! It is a surprisingly coherent story about trying to change the past. It is a thriller that thrills.<br /><br />What it does not do, is, it does not keep me from getting dizzy. Time machines do that to me. It is probably impossible to be entirely logical in this kind of plot, because the principle may be clear and well known, but the how is obviously still in the dark. And so are a few questions, like e.g. what happens when you move into the past with such a machine and become your own contemporary? Intriguing.<br /><br />'Only' four stars due to some of the plot's weaknesses. But I liked it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Why does Pink Floyd have such a huge following?  Skipping all the possibilities, I believe it's because they have achieved emotional heights/themes heretofore not reached by popular/rock music.  The music is enduring and transcends generations. Pink Floyd has had its stinkers but its work as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Genius is simplicity and its in this music.

This forces people to stop, think, and remember.<br /><br />* Concreteness: avoid statistics, use real-world analogies to help people understand complex ideas.<br /><br />* Credibility: if people don't trust you, they'll ignore you. In some cases, they will be openly hostile, which means they'll actively try to dispute your message!<br /><br />* Emotional: information makes people think, but emotion makes them act. Appeal to emotional needs, sometimes even way up on Maslow's hierarchy.<br /><br />* Stores: telling a story [gets] people into paying closer attention, and feeling more connected. Remember the Jared Subway commercials?<br /><br />The book ends with a five page reference guide that persuaded me of the author's value as consultants.  They have given us a low-cost book we can use our5selves, but I am also persuaded they are valuable as brain-stormers for those trying to craft transpartisan and electoral reform messages, so I am recommending them both to the leadership of Reuniting America.<br /><br />LOTS of details and examples.

B00005M91K|3.0|Yes, the photography is beautiful, intriguing, sometimes disturbing (the chicks). But as a whole, the images do not hold together, and this is perhaps because the music itself does not hold together. At times there is no music and only the natural sounds one would expect, given the images. If I'd seen it first, I wouldn't've bought it.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Is the word 'Masterpiece' an overstatement here? I don't know why this album has divided MCR fans down the middle and gotten mixed reviews. All I know that it's my first exposure to them and I think this album is brilliant akin to the likes of Sgt. Pepper (The Beatles), The Joshua Tree (U2), or Morning View (Incubus).<br /><br />That's a lot to say coming from someone who shudders at the idea of paying money for a punk, goth, or emo record. I can't tell if MCR is any of those, or a combination of them, or an aberration of them. The only thing that resonated with me before the first listen is that the lead singer is an Iron Maiden fan. I like the Beatles and Metallica, and have never listened to anything like this in my life.<br /><br />The main thing about this band is that they have passion. The Gerard Way (vocalist) screams, cries, seethes, and basically slops heart-on-the sleeve emotion all over the whole thing with either unbridled abandon, or the best damn artificial angst I've ever heard - probably a little of both. The guitars churn, the lead solos bleed, the drums incite rage. The lyrics are gut wrenching, the concept is dark and beautiful.<br /><br />Rarely does a modern record coax such strong feelings out of me. The sad parts bring tears, the biting humor is laugh-out-loud, and the hope and anger surge through every song.<br /><br />Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant. If you haven't yet, you owe it to yourself to get this, and join the Black Parade.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|An interesting film:  at no point will you be tempted to shut it off, despite the fact that most of it is nothing more than a Powerpoint presentation.<br /><br />Gore does a superb job illustrating how the earth's temperature has dramatically risen in the past 30 years or so and what effects this rise has had and will continue to have on the planet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he does a less than spectacular job showing the direct causal link between the rise in temperature and the activities and products that have caused it, leaving his prescription for action a bit vague:  more of a general indictment of the modern world instead of a clear economically viable strategy.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the movie are the sequences where Gore comprehensively demonstrates that the rise in temperatures over recent decades cannot be attributed to one of nature's wonted fluctuations.<br /><br />You do acquire more respect for Gore though, seeing as how he's apparently worked on this issue for years long before it was a widespread public concern.<br /><br />In sum, worth your time in a way that few things are.
B000002AGE|5.0|This is arguably the single greatest fusion album of all time.  (Herbie Hancock's \\"Headhunters\\" and Miles Davis's \\"Bitches Brew\\" might be its only competition) There are very few combinations of players who seem to form a bit of magic when they were together, but Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, and Jaco Pastorius were one of those combinations.  There is a reason why the post-Jaco Weather Report albums were not nearly as good as the ones with him, and it's because that magic was lost. <br /> <br />As far as the album itself goes...I don't even know how to start reviewing this.  It's like trying to do an art review on the Mona Lisa or something.  I mean, who doesn't know the tune to \\"Birdland\\"?  I suppose that the argument could be made that the synthesized sounds are outdated, but some of the tunes have become so iconic that you'll hardly notice.  And the playing is phenomenal.  Wayne Shorter gets a bit of a short shift on this album because it doesn't sound like he's playing anything particularly complex, but when you look at the music, you'll see why.  In some sections, the chord changes are literally happening EVERY SINGLE BEAT.  That's ridiculous. <br /> <br />And Jaco is just a madman (and considering his condition, I mean this in a good way).  There has never been a fretless player like him since, and I doubt that there ever will be again. <br /> <br />If you are interested in fusion, buy this and Herbie Hancock's \\"Headhunters\\" immediately.  You won't be disappointed.
B000005HLV|5.0|Bleak, dark, and oppressively extreme.  The unified vision and the technical precision on display gives this record an undeniable edge.  The drummer's full speed blasts underpin an atmosphere of relentless foreboding dread, before dropping the tempo to a crawl with some truly punishing fills.  This is the backbone for a dense, deep, swirling mist of guitar noise.  A mix that gives the infrequent solos an eerie, otherworldly quality to match their impressive sense of melody and timing.      The thick, layered production is reminiscent of 'Loveless' by My Bloody Valentine, but where that record is lush and dreamlike, this one is chilling and precise.  The insane vocals are an acquired taste, but succeed in sounding unhinged, demonic, hollow and ghostlike, fitting the music hand to glove.  The brilliantly titled 'Freezing Moon' and the hypnotic title track are the most accomplished individual showcases within this formidable creation.  Enthralling and utterly alienating in equal measure.
057507874X|5.0|Gothic thriller with horrific overtones, this novel is not for the faint of heart. But it is brilliantly written, with some of the most deliciously macabre imagery ever put in a novel about children. <br /> <br />The only thing that detracts from its brilliance is the weakness of the good  ultimately used to prevail against the powerful minions of evil. Bradbury's worldview doesn't allow for anything more powerfully good than humor in the face of horror. Unfortunate. It would have been nice to see the boys use virtue or faith or hope to triumph.  <br /> <br />But, by all means, read this book! You will be thrilled, horrified and firm in your resolution to never be in a library after closing time!!!!
1594200823|5.0|There are consequences for any action.  How many of us consider the greater significance of something we do several times daily? <br /> <br />This book examines distinct pathways of energy beginning with photosynthesis and how that energy is transformed before reaching the top of the food chain.  Behaviors, from molecular to large-scale interactions, are described with emphasis on the benefits and/or disadvantages to each participant.  The subject matter is insightful and humorous presented with the profound scrutiny of an investigative reporter.  If nothing else, it should raise readers' level of awareness about what they are doing before taking that next bite.  It may however, be so informative that some may radically change the manner in which they sustain themselves.  I certainly have. <br /> <br />
0743201140|1.0|Having read the many positive reviews on this book, as well as the slick high-production-value promotional collateral put out by it's authors and publisher, I hoped for something that would really help me identify and conceptualize how I could best/better apply my inherent talents and personality tendencies in the real world. <br /> <br />I knew I was in trouble right away when the book justified it's thesis not by scientific experiment and data, but rather by vague references to polling (the authors are employees of, or otherwise tied in with the Gallup polling organization) and anecdotal assertions about celebrities like Warren Buffet and Colin Powell.  <br /> <br />IF you MUST know what this book actually says, I can save you the time and money required to buy and read the book by conveying it's content in one sentence: It's important to consider and apply your inherent personality traits to maximize your career success. The book is nothing but a book-length repetition of this same message. The proof it vaguely offers to back up this intuitive \\"truistic\\" assertion is shallow and fluffy. Most disappointingly, that is all they wrote.  <br /> <br />The \\"personality test\\" is a great selling gimmick, but the information it returns reminds me of a horoscope or a fortune cookie. It is vague, and  general and difficult to relate to any particular practice, nor does the book offer practical means to turn these purported traits into practical beneficial action. If you're trying to decide whether to, say, stay on as a used car salesman, or retreat to some hermitage to write your magnum opus, this book will be of no practical help. It just repeats the same message over and over, page after page after chapter after chapter. Fluffity, fluff, fluff, fluff. <br /> <br />I must admit that I did get ONE practical idea from this fluffball book: Apparently anyone can make a mint by taking some specious bromide, e.g. \\"Doing whatever you want is good for you\\", and stretch it into a couple hundred pages of baseless repetitive assertion of that same idea, and have it lapped up by folks willing to pay a good buck to hear what they want to hear. <br /> <br />
B000002LSV|5.0|Wow!! What a great compilation. I just can't get enough of ZZ Top. These guys really rock as I can play them over n over and over again. I think that song Gimme All Your Lovin is one of the greatest songs in rock history, ever!! GREAT MUSIC..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL ROCK FANS WITH A GREAT TASTE IN MUSIC. GET THIS WITH ALBUMS FROM METALLICA.
B0000025H0|4.0|I purchased this on vinyl when it came out and I still like this album. Carlos still had the fire in his belly. What he's doing nowadays is OK but I can't get too worked up about it. He has softened up his sound and records sales go up, wow, not THERE'S A shocker!!<br /><br />Even though I am not too excited by what he's doing these days Carlos will always have a place in my heart. Although he's got some good stuff out there his first 3 CDs are still classics to me. Listen to the track TOUSSAINT L'OVERTURE from his 3rd album, for me THAT was the classic Santana sound and nobody did THAT better!! Nobody!!<br /><br />[..]
B000N4SADC|4.0|This is my first Hiromi experience. I kept getting her confused with Hideki, er, Keiko Matsui. I figured anything with John McLaughlin's nephew Tony Grey on bass and Dave Fuicynski involved has got to be worth checking out. One pat on the back for me. Hiromi proves herself quite nimble on the keyboards and at times, threatens to blow your doors off. It's not \\"smooth\\" jazz, it's not traditional jazz. It's kind of fusion pop rocks. Hiromi forcefully states her case for being considered in the upper echelon of today's jazz pianists. I'd expect nothing less from an alum from the mighty Berlee School of Music in Beantown. Highly recommended![[ASIN:B000N4SADC Time Control]]
0060736267|5.0|Francie Nolan, the sweet and heartbreaking main character in Betty Smith's \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" details her life in turn of the century Brooklyn. The daughter of an enchanting but alcoholic father and an industrious but distant mother, Francie is a dreamy child with lofty ambitions despite the poverty in which she lives. Francie provides a sad, but moving description of life as she knows it and the tragedy and fortune that befalls her and her family.<br /><br />\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is a very hard novel to review. It's about more than just one little girl and her family. This novel is about abject poverty, immigrants and their status in their own neighborhood and new country, alcoholism, and above all else, this novel is about carving out a place for oneself in the world. I absolutely adored this novel. It definitely ranks in my top 10 all time favorite novels. The imagery and the story are woven in such a fantastic way that this book will be one that lingers in the mind, long after you have finished it.

B00005JPD0|3.0|Tony Scott's latest thriller offers a different kind of time travel that actually allows its hero to go back in the past and not meet himself.  In watching this entertaining, if somewhat contrived, thriller, one can make the following observations:<br /><br />1.  Executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer (THE CSI FRANCHISES) still knows how to make great action movies with some fabulous scenarios;<br /><br />2.  Denzel Washington is such a good actor he can even take on roles that would normally fall into Steven Seagal or Jean Claude van Damme's hands;<br /><br />3.  Jim Caviezel has played bad guys 90 percent of the time since playing Jesus, but is still a competent actor;<br /><br />4.  Scriptwriters can get away with implausibility in movies like this, IF they are as well done.<br /><br />Overall, an adequate timewaster.
B000O178BY|3.0|This is a good album in a lot of ways and I think it gets better as it goes on. I don't want to be one of these people who have to compare new albums to older albums but on that note, this album doesn't seem to do as much for me as the previous ones. On the other hand it's definately not a quote unquote \\"return to form\\" (a term I am getting increasingly sick of hearing in these reviews.) It sounds nothing like any other NIN release except in a few places. The extremely underrated With Teeth that everyone is so fond of bashing has more elements of older sounds. And if I may say, With Teeth is the first NIN album of a whole new Trent so you kind of have to put that into perspective and you may find that the album does grow on you over time. People have such a high standard with NIN that if it's anything short of a masterpiece (which Trent never claimed it to be btw) then its just not good. But that's sheep for ya. (If you're one of those people who listen to it twice and decide you are not a fan you will never like it.) I really liked Year Zero initially but the more I have listened I am finding that it's not his best work. Not that it has to be. It's a step in a new direction which is good. BUT...I hate to say it but sometimes I feel like he made the album to please the fairweather fans (who can't get past the first three albums.) The whinies who weren't quite satisfied with his last album or so because they weren't everything PHM and TDS were. It's almost like what U2 did with All That You Can't Leave Behind but different. There are some sweet tracks here: Vessel, Me, I'm Not, My Violent Heart.. a lot of the second half. But I just don't find myself throwing it in the player as often. Like once you've heard it you've heard it. I'm not really finding a lot of new stuff that I haven't heard before (ie. I can still put The Fragile on and hear new things and I've been a fan for years.) So yes, some say its a masterpiece, (some even want to throw the cliche 'return to form' around because they can't come up with more intelligent things to say), some say its crap. I would say neither. Good, not his best, not The Fragile by a long shot, but it doesn't have to be. I think he can do better. Each album is what it is and that's the whole beauty of it. Fun chaotic sounds. I respect his beliefs (not that I agree with it all but who does) and all that he is trying to do I won't take that away from him and I like the whole futureshock concept. I'm just saying it's not the extravagant return to a previous sound that people are saying. But why should have he to do that to get people to like you're music. (ie. the way the new Pearl Jam cd was \\"described\\" before everyone ate it up) I would say he made With Teeth for the real fans. Year Zero on the other hand is not necessarily for me but I like it all.

B000056JYB|5.0|This album features Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker(fresh from Cream), Steve Winwood(fresh from Traffic) and Ric Grech(so fresh from Family that he bailed mid-tour to join). For me, my favorite Eric stuff has always been the Yardbirds, Cream and Blind Faith and for Steve Traffic and Blind Faith. So you're not going to be surprised when I tell you that this is a must have. Every song on the original album is wonderful and has never sounded better. Songs like Had To Cry Today, Can't Find My Way Home and Sea Of Joy sound unlike anything anyone else has ever done although the same could be said for everything on here. There seems to be a little debate over the bonus tracks and if they're worth the extra price. For me, yes. I love jammy stuff so this is right up my alley and the alternate versions are execellent and I just wish that there was more. I really do believe when it comes to something as classic as this you should really get the whole picture.

B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen depicts The House of Windsor during one of its most tumultuous weeks: that which followed the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II does a magnificent job portraying the monarch's quandaries as she is faced with a challenge for which her forty five year long reign has not prepared her: how to deal with the sudden death of a former daughter-in-law who was deeply and uncharacteristically emotionally beloved by the British.<br /><br />The film opens in May 1997 with the election of Tony Blair.  His visit to Buckingham Palace, accompanied by his republican-minded wife, is one of the funniest scenes in the film as Her Majesty gently but firmly puts him in his place: \\"I'm the one who asks, Mr. Blair.\\"  Then the film turns darker as we see Diana's last summer in a photo montage, culminating in the paparazzi chase which led to the fatal car crash in Paris.  We relive the shock felt by the Royal Family, the Government, and the world as the news spread, and then we are led through the negotiations as Mr. Blair carefully helps the Queen recognize that her first reaction, to treat the death as a private family matter, is untenable in the face of deep national mourning.<br /><br />There are many fine scenes in this film.  I am especially fond of the elk scene, where the Queen, stranded at Balmoral, gives way to some private tears.  I also love a brief moment of tenderness that crosses her face when she watches Charles telling his sons about their mother's death. (I am also impressed with how tactful the film's producers were in not showing close ups of William and Harry during that awful week).  Tony Blair's losing patience with his staff's sniping at the Queen and angrily  defending her is also very fine.  But the most moving moment comes when the Queen makes her way through the crowds at Buckingham Palace, feeling cold and rejected until the little girl hands her a bouquet saying \\"They're for you.\\" That scene, and the following one as the women begin to curtsey, brings tears to my eyes. Finally, the Queen's  warning to Blair that he too will fall someday has a particularly ironic ring these days.<br /><br />The DVD production is well made, but with few extras beyond an audio commentary and a featurette on the film's production.  Such a superb production needs little support, and I intend to rewatch The Queen many times.one as the women begin to curtsey, brings tears to my eyes.

1582701709|2.0|[...]    I declare shenanagans! There is some truth to this \\"law of attraction, which states that like attracts like. The concept says that the energy you put into the world--both good and bad--is exactly what comes back to you.

Come now, I think we all know people who aren't that positive but are very successful in one way or another. And this talk of everything being energy is hogwash (I've always wanted to use that word). Whether it is true or not is irrelevant. It doesn't provide any evidence for \\"the Secret\\" being true - that's for sure. What can be taken from this \\"Secret\\" idea is that you need to believe in yourself if you are going to be successful in any way.

B000AP04L0|3.0|Since its release in 1999, Mike Judge's dedication to all slaves of their cubicles has become a cult movie with many devoted admirers. I believe the reason being - majority of us have to work and many are not very happy with their jobs or job environment. If asked, everyone may recall to having a boss from hell, to be annoyed by changing every week TES (Time Entering System), by the printer or copy machine that seem to hate you and break on you every time you need to print or copy something. Well, with all recognizable funny and sad details of the modern office environment that show Judge's observant eye and wicked sense of humor, the movie is not a great one and not always a good one. It is an average comedy that had interesting potentials but is too long for its length and loses its steam somewhere after first thirty minutes. It's got too many subplots and supporting characters that were neither interesting, nor necessary, for example, the romance between Peter and a local waitress (Jennifer Aniston). A moneymaking scheme that Peter and his friends devise belongs to the different movie and Peter's transformation in the end does not seem to be plausible. I was happy for Milton though. :)<br /><br />6.5/10
B000MRAAJM|5.0|For people who don't see a clear difference between regular dvd and blu-ray because you don't have the full set-up, don't fault the blu-ray or hd technology.  You will be blown away once you see it in full 1080p. <br /> <br />I ordered the blu-ray set and have been watching the hd broadcasts on Discovery HD.  And I've also tried to watch non-HD broadcasts on the science channel and discovery channel when I missed the HD broadcasts.  I understand that standard cable output is lower resolution than dvd, but I have also compared movies that I have in both regular dvd and blu-ray 1080p. <br /> <br />While the blu-ray and hd-dvd sets are missing a few hours of footage that are included in the standard dvd set, by not seeing this amazing series in full 1080p, you are missing out on so much more.  The value of HD cannot be measured simply by hours of content.  You are getting four times as much visual information per frame.  Even that is a flawed measure.  It is like relating vhs to dvd simply by numbers.  And the cost of a blu-ray disc is much higher than a standard dvd to begin with.  Not all circular pieces of plastic are created equal.  You are not paying more for less. <br /> <br />It would have been better if the bonus episode and the making-of features were included, but even without this is a much better presentation than the standard dvd set.  They do not compare.  Watch the series on a proper 1080p display WITH hdmi or dvi connection and proper viewing distance.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|\\"Fracture\\" (2007) is directed by Gregory Hoblit who has also made \\"Frequency\\" (2000), \\"Fallen\\" (1998) both of which I like and \\"Primal Fear\\" (1996) - his feature debut that I love.<br /><br />Crime /Thriller/Mystery /Court Drama are among my favorite genres and as long as the combination of these genres is clever, gripping, atmospheric, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of \\"Fracture\\" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his \\"playful Dr. Lector\\" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. \\"Fracture\\" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found \\"Fracture\\" quite good.<br /><br />3.5/5.

B0000640SA|4.0|Memento is a remarkable, one of a kind film that bears (and probably requires) multiple viewing.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|You can take the title of this review in two ways: 1) The star referencing Matt Damon's character portrayal of a government agent so loyal to his country that nothing comes a close second to the duty and honor he serves with. And 2) the star referencing the CIA and literally how it came into existence.<br /><br />I've seen some quotes directly or indirectly suggesting that The Good Shepard is \\"the best spy movie ever made\\". That may be true if you like a movie that is as long and wide as its aspect ratio with very little action.<br /><br />And the lack of action was deliberate on DiNiro's part (DiNiro directs and also co-stars). DiNiro is on record in almost every interview about the film as saying that The Good Shepard was more the story of the birth of counter-intelligence than it was a Bond-like action movie with gadgets, car chases and explosions.<br /><br />And indeed a good, interesting story it is. It definitely keeps you interested. The acting is superb. And, sure, there's a little action. But Hollywood lately is self-absorbed with movies that are well over 2 hours, and The Good Shepard's tune could have been named in a lot less than 167 minutes.<br /><br />That's right...2 hours and 47 minutes. I was reminded of this movie the other day as I was walking through the corrals that lead up to the airport security checkpoint....You go back and forth seemingly forever seeing the same people pass you on the left and right a dozen times before you reach your ultimate goal of putting your bag on the X-ray belt and walking through the metal detector with no real sense of joy that you just finished a task that should have taken 5 minutes but took 30 minutes. In The Good Shepard you wait and wait for something to happen seeing the same actors over and over again with very little action and then the movie just ends with no real sense that there was a story that led up to \\"that climactic moment\\".<br /><br />So do you want to hurry up and wait to see how the CIA was born? At minimum, it's a well-told story. Ya got a minute...or 167? Give The Good Shepard a large allocation of your time.got a minute...or 167? Give The Good Shepard a large allocation of your time.
B000O178BY|5.0|As with most artists, when there is little time between albums, the usual result is to crank out filler or sell records. This is not the case with Year Zero. I have been a fan of NIN since the Mid-90's and they have never dissapointed. Though With_Teeth was an excellent album it did not have the cerebral quality that I have come to love from NIN. That being said this album is, for lack of a better word, perfect. The thing to realize when listening to this is it's not a series of singles but a entire masterpiece divided into smaller chapters. While keeping with NIN's sonic trademark experimental sound, the added theme of the end of the world only solidified the focus of this album. Such songs as \\"The Great Destroyer\\" and \\"In This Twilight\\" create such an epic landscape that one can only stand in awe of this juggernaut of art and social commentary. As with most albums (I know this was the case with The Fragile) you have to listen to it a few times before you really get the whole picture of the what the album portrays. It is at times beautiful and entrancing, at other points it is painful and destructive. It's been a long time since an album has captured my attention like this one has. Well worth the purchase. A must have CD.

1582701709|1.0|I know what I will do.  I will wish for a lot of people to pay me a bunch of money.  I will imagine that they are going to do that.  Now I will go write a book and make a video telling about my success that I know is going to come.  I will now wait for all the money to start rolling in.  O wait, Rhonda Byrne has already done that.  Instead of reading The Secret I recommend reading the Bible if you want to have true success.    I will also point out that the author implies that everything \\"bad\\" that happens to us is something that we have attracted and is therefore our own fault.  Try telling that to a crack baby.  The man Job was a man who did everything right, but he lost everything and then gained back twice as much.  I would like for Rhonda Byrne to try to explain that.  God is in control, he has always been in control and will always be in control.  He gives us limited ability to influence various aspects of our lives, but ultimately he is still in control.  God wants to give us good things, but he must punish sin.  It isn't a sin to park a car in the middle of the garage.  Most of the examples in the book are nothing more than self fulfilling prophecies.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|Having heard so many good things about this film, I had to see it for myself.  I won't give a plot summary of the film, as it has been done to death, instead I'll let you know the highs and lows for me.<br /><br />There are a lot of great quotes and lines throughout the movie.  One of the first is the one I used as a title for this review, meaning \\"I will not serve\\" by James Joyce, from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.  Another is \\"The Irish are the only people impervious to psychoanalysis\\" by Sigmund Freud.  Then there is a scene where Jack Nicholson (Frank) asks a man \\"How's your mother?\\" The man answers, \\"She's on her way out.\\" Frank then replies \\"We all are, act accordingly.\\"<br /><br />The acting in this movie is extremely well done, with one exception, and the action and suspense is non stop.  If you blink at all during this movie, chances are you'll miss something. It is not a movie for people who don't enjoy violence or have a weak stomach, as there are a few gag worthy moments.<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with the movie was Jack Nicholson(the exception)as Frank; he starts out the movie with an accent, loses it for awhile, then kind slips in and out of it for the rest of the film, it drove me nuts.  I also really hated the ending, of course I can't tell you why, but it was so crazy and ridiculous to me, it resulted in some stunned laughter from both my husband and I.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good film, if not for Jack Nicholson's accent faux pas and the ludicrous ending; it could have easily been a 5 star film.  I wasn't blown away like I expected to be, but I really enjoyed it.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren excels in the title role as Queen Elizabeth II, whose privacy, traditionalism, and perceived stoicism are put to the test when her subjects attack her motives and expect her to pour her emotions out in public after the death of Princess Diana.  This film is an interesting exploration of the old monarchy vs. the \\"modern age.\\"  Sure, I think monarchies are old-fashioned and need to go the way of the dinosaur.  But at the same time, I don't see why those who choose not to flaunt their emotions in public should be judged so harshly for it.<br /><br />Otherwise:  James Cromwell does nicely as Prince Phillip, as does the fellow playing Tony Blair.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Well first let me say that filmwork here is beautiful and amazing.  It is definitely on par with [[ASIN:B000069HXC The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (Parts 1-4)]].<br /><br />Now for what is not here.  Those who have seen [[ASIN:B000069HXC The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (Parts 1-4)]], [[ASIN:B000EBD9W6 Life in the Undergrowth]], [[ASIN:B00008OM6K The Life of Mammals]], [[ASIN:B000069HXL The Life of Birds]], and (not or) [[ASIN:B000BJS4FS Life in the Freezer]] will be surprised to discover that this is first of the collection to offer few new behaviors and observations.  Indeed if you have seen them all or own them all (as i do) little here will be new to you.  This was somewhat shocking to me as so many reviews talk of seeing all these new behaviors that have never been filmed before.  Having seen every minute of this dvd i can say that if you own the lot there is little new here.  Even the scene praised before were the ducklings jump from the tree for dear life and than race for water was already seen in [[ASIN:B000069HXL The Life of Birds]] and there the little baby birds did it at night without their parents presence using only the sound of their voice to guide them to water.<br /><br />So is this worth owning if you own the lot, yes and no.  If you own all the others released in the states this is still worth owning, if you have the money and if you are ok with getting a visual update but accept that little here is \\"new\\" in the way that [[ASIN:B000069HXC The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (Parts 1-4)]], [[ASIN:B000EBD9W6 Life in the Undergrowth]], [[ASIN:B00008OM6K The Life of Mammals]] and The Life of Birds were new.  Without a doubt this is worth seeing for any veteran of all the others.<br /><br />If you do not own the others I would STRONGLY recommend you seeing all the ones mentioned here in and THEN deciding which or all you would like to own.<br /><br />For me, I own the lot and have seen them each maybe 10-20 times.

B00006ADFL|5.0|Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey debuted, I think, in this incredibly creepy true story of two young girls, in 1950s New Zealand, who developed an obsessive friendship involving a fantasy world, Hollywood dreams, and the tragically real murder of one girl's mother.   Too young to be tried as adults, they spent practically no time in jail, and one went on to become the writer Anne Perry.  How's that for irony?  Early work by Peter Jackson, who went on to greater fame with the LOTR trilogy.  The two women were perfectly cast; Lynskey even looks a lot like the real Pauline.
B00005JPPL|4.0|It's risky for a story to intentionally fool with time, specifically a linear sequence of events; the end result will be either a uniquely constructed narrative or a convoluted mess. \\"Next\\"--based on Philip K. Dick's short story \\"The Golden Man\\"--is about a man who has the ability to see two minutes into his own future, which is just enough of a heads up to prevent certain things from happening. The idea is enough to attract anyone's attention, and thank goodness that it actually redeems itself by the end of the film; while nowhere near as complex or thought provoking as last summer's Philip K. Dick adaptation--\\"A Scanner Darkly\\"--it still manages to be a thoroughly entertaining story, a pre-summer popcorn flick with an engaging plot and decent performances. <br /> <br />The film opens in Las Vegas, where Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) headlines a magic show under the alias Frank Cadillac. When not on stage, he gambles at local casinos, puffing on cigarettes while trying to manipulate his odds of hitting jackpots. He is, of course, under constant surveillance, and on this particular night, his antics go a little too far, prompting Security to intervene. The situation is made worse when he envisions a casino shooting and prevents it from happening; he makes himself look guilty, and he's forced to escape. This sequence is loaded with plausibility problems; even if you have the ability to peak into the future, it's still impossible to escape the ever-present surveillance cameras (I should know; I've been to Vegas many times). Not only can Security see his every move, they also follow him closely as he darts around the casino. Yet he escapes with ease. He also manages to steal someone's car. <br /> <br />Luckily, the rest of the film succeeds in overshadowing this sequence. This is when FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is introduced; she's had her eye on Johnson ever since learning of an international threat against America. A group of Russian terrorists have stolen a nuclear warhead and plan to detonate it in Los Angeles, which will result in the deaths of eight million people. Johnson's precognitive abilities are perfectly suited for preventing a disaster of this magnitude, which is why she feels justified in forcing him to cooperate. After all, it's not about him: it's about saving millions of lives. <br /> <br />Johnson, as you might expect, is not anxious to be a pawn of the American government. The most obvious solution is for him to leave Vegas and hide in some remote part of the country. But he can't. This is because, for reasons he can't explain, he's been having visions of a young woman in a local diner, and he simply has to meet her and find out why. This is a troubling situation; when it comes to this mystery woman, he can see far beyond two minutes into the future. It's never adequately explained, even when he finally does meet her after months of visiting the diner, sitting at the counter and sipping away at martinis (you usually don't associate martinis with diners, but I digress). Her name is Liz (Jessica Biel), and she befriends Johnson when he disrupts a confrontation between her and her controlling ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br />It isn't until the two meet that Johnson finally decides to flee Vegas; they both travel to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Liz teaches at a local Native American reservation. Unbeknownst to them both, Agent Ferris and her team are hot on their trail. The same can be said for the Russian terrorists; Johnson is a threat that must be eliminated at any cost. <br /> <br />Parts of this film play like scenes from a run-of-the-mill Espionage Thriller, much like the material of a James Bond story: we have the dastardly plot to destroy a major city; we have the international bad guys; we have the lone figure who has the ability to stop them. This was actually more of a distraction than anything else, which may be bothersome to those who have read the original Philip K. Dick story; to say that this adaptation is unfaithful to its source would be an understatement. But in all honesty, a comparison is completely unnecessary. I say this because the screen story stands on it's own, and for the most part, it works. Johnson is a fascinating character--someone both blessed and cursed with a supernatural ability that could be used for humanity's benefit. But how would it benefit him? \\"If I help you,\\" he says after he's caught by the FBI and restrained in front of a TV screen, \\"you'll keep me strapped to this chair forever.\\" He has a point; he may be able to foil this nuclear threat, but it would mean the loss of his personal freedom. <br /> <br />The final sequences of the film follow a fairly routine structure: Johnson teams up with the FBI hoping to save both the population of Los Angeles and Liz, who has since been kidnapped by the Russians. Johnson's ability is used to its fullest at this point; this is a treat for the audience, especially during a climactic sequence in an industrial complex. All this paves the way for an end sequence that I didn't see coming. I won't go so far as to call it a twist ending, but I will say that it was unique. I don't know if the same can be said for \\"Next\\" as a whole, but so what? It was entertaining just the same.
B00006AVRK|5.0|The title for my review comes from one of the Roaring 20s songs, \\"Nagasaki,\\" that Wooster is so fond of.  You'll hear other songs from the multitalented Hugh Laurie, sometimes joined by friend and colleague Stephen Fry, as they play, respectively, the bumbling Bertie Wooster and his brilliant, patient valet Reginald Jeeves.   <br /> <br />Nobody needs help getting through life more than Bertie!  He's been raised by overbearing aunts, he's got a goofy cousin and many foolish friends, he doesn't get along well with kids or dogs, and he can't keep house to save his life.  He has money but no sense.  Along comes Jeeves to rescue him from himself and many other tangles he gets himself into.   <br /> <br />The third and fourth seasons' NYC-based stories tend to be weaker, overall, than most of the others, with too much farce and slapstick and not enough wordplay, but every episode is worth watching.  You never know what will happen next.   This series has made me curious to see the two leads' earlier work together, A Bit of Fry and Laurie.  You will, of course, also recognize Laurie as House, MD, the hit show on FOX; and Fry is still busily acting as well, even showing up recently on another FOX show, Bones.  I hope someone at the studio can figure out how to get House on Bones with Fry, or Fry on the set of House as a patient or fellow doctor.     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0374105235|5.0|I began to develop an interest in the civil war in Sierra Leone after watching the movie Blood Diamonds, and came across this title. The book is a gripping biography, made all the more horrific as it tells the story of a young boy, Ishmael who finds himself fleeing the comforts of family and normal life at 12, only to be kidnapped and forced to undergo indoctrination and training to be a boy soldier/killer. This poor kid and many others of his age group were not only brainwashed but completely dehumanized, being fed a steady diet of drugs and hatred, and unleashed as killers. It was only with UNICEF's intervention that Beah is rescued from a monstrous fate and rehabilitated. His story is very relevant in a world filled with hate and violence, and all the more necessary given how little most of us know about the atrocities occuring in third world nations today. Definitely a must-read!
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I had such high hopes for this version of Jane Eyre.  But when Jane arose out of the mist and frightened the man's horse, he took the name of the Lord my God in vain.  I am very much saddened and disappointed that I could watch the movie no further.  As a Christian I cannot support a movie that drags His name in the dirt as an expletive. I believe Charlotte Bronte would have strongly objected to her story being used to demean Christ.
B0001XALTG|4.0|Bearing that in mind, I think Trainspotting is quite well done. The problem is there's so many things surrounding the drug issue I just don't know what to think of the film. Is Trainspotting a bit too glossy, too movie-like? In some ways it is... the characters are funny, and larger than life, easily able to get through 90% of their troubles even when these things could be profound issues in real life. There's barely a trace of existential despair. For the most part these anti-heroes are just self indulgent party guys, that create their own gritty, destructive life. You don't get the sense of any of them being alienated from families or social support. If they're supposed to be the genuine ghettoized, they don't come across as it other than behavioral problems they choose to have. <br /> <br />However, if you get past the fact that making a movie about drugs is hard as hell because you'll either come across as too cautionary or too glamorous, then Trainspotting is very witty, slick movie. In the end it doesn't make any final calls about drugs or morality, which is how it does manage to stay somewhat out of the realm of criticism, but at the same time it's slightly disappointing. Don't we watch movies to see what they can reveal about the center of human behavior? If that's the case, although Trainspotting is very amusing, it has no answers.
B000LE1FAY|4.0|One of my favorite bands from the '80s was the Go Go's. Their music was fun and catchy. I liked some of Belinda Carlisle's solo work. I recently came across Belinda's latest album \\"Voila\\" which is a French album, how appropo since she lives in France. I was pleasantly surprised to hear how good the album is since a lot of crossover albums basically rots in my personal opinion. Belinda's Parisian album worked for the most part in terms of achieving that sensuous Parisian feel. There were a couple of tracks I was not too keen on like \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\" and \\"Jezebel\\". I didn't care for \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\" because I found the melodies so irritating and as much as this pains me to say this but Belinda's vocals grates on my nerves on this particular song. The bonus disc with the english versions of some of the songs were okay but I definitely prefer the Parisian versions. My favorite song on this album has to be \\"Sous Le Ciel De Paris\\". I found the melodies difficult to get out of my head. Although I do not understand a lick of French, I just loved hearing Belinda Carlisle sing the lyrics. I also loved the added touch of the accordion. Despite not liking a couple of songs on the album, \\"Voila\\" is still a lot of fun to listen to. In this day and age of disposable pop acts, it is always great to see someone I grew up on like Belinda Carlisle put out some new music.
1582701709|5.0|I'm not at all surprised at all the negative reviews. It's a good thing for people to believe in their ability to critically review information. The mind relates to ideas, though, associatively, and when an idea is not sufficiently connected to what one already accepts as one's belief structure, then that idea will always appear far-fetched. What people need to realize is that an idea is not wrong just because it is currently unfathomable to them. Most of us have no awareness of how much nonsense we've already accepted into our individual reality constructs. My opinion is that this is an idea whose time has come, even though it is an idea that is thousands of years old, and that it has come just in time for the possible salvation of the Earth biosphere from destruction by the human pathogen. For those who consider their minds to be so rational, the scientists can describe at least fifty reasons why our species is doomed to a slow, or not so slow path to extinction. To me, the choice is to believe in \\"magic,\\" or to become morbidly depressed. \\"Magic for me,please. In fact, make that a double-helping.\\"
B000N6U0E2|5.0|There is a scene in this amazing movie that really stood out for me and I don't think I'm really giving anything away by relating it to you all, but anyway, Chris Gardener is at the schoolyard with his son and his son is playing basketball and he shoots and makes a basket. Chris Gardener tells his son that he'll probably be good at a lot of things in life, but he'll probably be lousy at basketball just like he was. And in an instant, you can see the joy draining out of his son's eyes. Gardener realizes what he just told his son and says something truly amazing, \\"Don't let anyone tell you what you can do - not even me. People like to tell you that you can't do something because they can't. If you want something in this world, go out and get it...\\"<br /><br />How many of us had big, huge dreams as a kid and then somebody (usually someone very close and dear to us) told us to be \\"realistic\\"? And so we grow up...supposedly...and we forget about those dreams, those wishes, those visions we had when we were younger and we get into jobs that we hate only because it pays the bills and keeps a roof over our head and puts food on the table but deep down in our gut we know that we \\"sold out\\".<br /><br />This movie inspired me greatly. It made me look at what I really want in my life in every area. It made me realize that age is nothing but a number and it's okay to have dreams and visions. Gardener did. Even when it looked at though he \\"lost\\" everything he still had the love and the admiration of his devoted son, and that love propelled him to new heights because that is what love does. It also got me to forgive my dad for a lot of things he told me growing up as a kid. I know he was only trying to keep me safe and not get hurt by having outlandish dreams of what I wanted to be, do, and have because in many ways, he gave up his dreams by raising a family. I don't know if it was a sacrafice, but he defintely renounced certain things in order to put food on the table and clothes on our backs.<br /><br />This movie filled me to overflowing with joyful tears at the end. It's the kind of movie that makes you glad to not only be human but a human being and that is what we are really here for - to be - not to simply exist, not to always be doing, but to be and in that beingness we strive to leave the world just a little bit better than it was before we got here.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings,<br /><br />john \\"the Light Coach\\"thes on our backs. <br /> <br />This movie filled me to overflowing with joyful tears at the end.

B000NA1Z1A|5.0|Fantastic album. As I said in my review title, this is a rare gem in a sea of crappy copycats and sound-alikes; in a world where everyone is trying to release a sound that sounds like everyone else sounds (does that make sense?), Amy Winehouse releases a throw-back to better musical days.<br /><br />This album is a confirmation of the fact that good music will never die, even if dead music continues to live. The smooth R&B/blues/soul/jazz sounds are Mo-town all over again. And I am thrilled.<br /><br />I am a musical purist and I don't care for much of what is released these days, but this album is a wonderful exploration of the old sounds with an updated groove and a funky edge.<br /><br />Every song is at least good. In my humble opinion, the standouts are \\"Rehab\\", \\"You know I'm No Good\\", \\"Back to Black\\", \\"Tears Dry On Their Own\\", \\"Some Unholy War\\", and \\"He Can Only Hold Her\\".<br /><br />To carry that one step further, I would point to true, amazing standouts as \\"ME & MR. JONES\\", a slow groove with motown like backing vocals and thick leading vocals from Amy. A true treat for the ears.<br />Also, \\"JUST FRIENDS\\". This has to be the BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. A smooth, rasta-infused jazzy upbeat tune, slow and easy. This gal is amazing.<br /><br />Man, can you say Lauryn Hill, Billie Holiday, Etta James? This lady has a beautiful future if she sticks with what got her to this point. Her vocals are purely classic, thick and textured like few others can. She has placed herself at the pinnacle of musical history, not just modern music.<br /><br />Simply stated, this album is sardonic, muddled, ironic, melancholy rantings of an alcoholic (recovering or admitted, I'm not sure) siren.<br /><br />A must have for any pure music lover.<br /><br />I am very picky about music, sticking mostly to classics (classical, classic rock, mo-town, big-band, swing, blues or jazz) but this album breaks through the monotony of the typical crap of today and shines brightly.<br /><br />WITHOUT A DOUBT, THIS SHOULD BE ALBUM OF THE YEAR AT THE GRAMMY'S. WON'T SURPRISE ME IF SHE'S OVERLOOKED BY THE SHEEP, BUT SHE DESERVES IT 100%.E ME IF SHE'S OVERLOOKED BY THE SHEEP, BUT SHE DESERVES IT 100%.
0618680004|4.0|I listened to The God Delusion as an audiobook, and found it fascinating.  I've engaged in debates with my husband over it, and he hasn't even read it yet!  Such is the substance of a very thought-provoking book.  My husband insists that atheism is as much a religion as any other religion, but I beg to disagree.  As Dawkins quotes, I think, Bertrand Russell, in the book, if I didn't exist for all the millennia before my birth, why do I insist that I have to exist in some form after my death?  It's just not important.  People insist on an afterlife because they are so self-centered, it is an affront to them to think that they can ever completely cease to exist.  Ernest Becker in his sometimes brilliant \\"The Denial of Death\\" also addresses this question and states that humans insist they must have a soul to elevate themselves in importance as individuals.  Also interesting is the fact that the atoms in ones body are recycled throughout ones life so how can one claim unique existence.<br /><br />Dawkins brings up hundreds of points that stimulate lively discussion, which is the purpose of his book.  While some of his arguments aren't as complete as they might be -- like the important role that religion, as a form of superstition and explaining the unexplainable -- has played in human history, the book has many ideas that deserve to be stated, and driven home.  I especially identified with his characterization of God in the three major religions as a judgmental, ruthless, punishing dictator.  That to me more clearly than anything, proves that this God is nothing other than a human's  personification of a human.  Because only humans have the qualities attributed to this supernatural being.<br /><br />As a person with a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology myself, I fully understand his reliance on the argument that Darwin's theory of natural selection provides the simplest and most elegant explanation of the complexity and diversity of life on earth.  The science of probability explains why earth happened to be one of the planets on which life could evolve (see this week's newspaper articles on another true earthlike planet discovered elsewhere in the universe.  Dawkins himself will I'm sure applaud the evidence that we are NOT unique).  The power of science over religion is that by applying the scientific method we can continuously narrow the realm of things we don't know.  To me this is far more powerful than the leap of faith, which requires one to cease to ask any questions at all.<br /><br />I also think Dawkins does an admirable job of destroying the idea that in the modern world we have to rely on a supernatural being to explain anything.  While the author obviously picks and chooses among his source materials to document his views, he nonetheless does a thorough job in such documentation.  I think he has written a highly informative book that stimulates intellectual re-examination of a topic that will never go out of style.rth happened to be one of the planets on which life could evolve (see this week's newspaper articles on another true earthlike planet discovered elsewhere in the universe.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|Perfect cast, perfect writing, perfect setting. Entertainment does not get better than this adult show that talks about REAL relationships, and shows through all the seasons the development of each character. If you are watching the show on TBS, turn your TV off and buy this DVD set; the edited version are like adding water to your favorite wine. It just doesn't work. Although a few more extras would have been nice, this DVD set is a great value. You'll find yourself wanting to go to New York after you watch the series.
1577314808|2.0|The book contains some powerful ideas and lots of explanation of what those ideas are but it doesn't really teach you how to get there. I understand that the author wants us to free ourselves from the burden of the mind and the body and embrace the present moment and experience just being. I can see the path to enlightenment in this but the book didn't explain me how to get there.  <br /> <br />Other things I found problematic with the book is that the author made the mind look like an evil machine whose sole purpose is to destroy your peaceful state and he was suggesting to free yourself from your mind and your body in order to achieve true consciousness. I didn't quite follow this. He also kept talking about \\"surrender\\" by which he means to accept things as they are. He tried to explain how we can achieve the change we're seeking without resistance (i.e. surrender) but again I didn't quite see how to get into that state and what it will do for me.  <br /> <br />The book was useful such that it helped me to realize the power of the present moment and it also helped me to stop the unnecessary resistance to every day things but other than that, I don't feel any more conscious. I wish it contained more real guidance and less explanation.

His desire to maintain integrity, hold to his values, and truly bring about a better America are admirable. Of course, I don't think his plans for bringing these things about are the most effective ones. With such an important political season coming up, everyone should read this book. The best way to make an informed vote is to really know the candidates, so take this opportunity to get to know Barack Obama.
B000MV9026|3.0|Well this movie was certainly nothing like I expected it to be!  The animation and cast were both amazing.  I like the underlying theme of helping the environment, I did not at all appreciate the blatant religious content.  I found it very disturbing, especially in a Disney movie and with no warning whatsoever. It sort of overshadowed and darkened the movie for me. I think if the writer's would have stuck with the problems of animals fighting to survive in a world where humans take for granted and take advantage then the movie would have made more sense.  I really can't understand why there was such a strong religious aspect to the movie at all, I think it detracts rather than supports the message. (and yes, I do \\"believe\\", I just don't see how it fits well into the movie at all, especially all the \\"fire and brimstone\\")<br /><br />Okay, enough of my griping, on the plus side, I really loved the little Mexico penguins, they were so cute and I'm just a sucker for the accent :) I loved the Elvis-like dad penguin and all the relationships throughout were very interesting.<br /><br />All in all if you can try to see past all the organized religious content it was a very different and somewhat funny movie. My kids did really enjoy it. My 18 month old niece is hysterical. Whenever anyone says \\"Happy Feet\\" she immediately (before you even get the whole phrase out) starts to do the dance, weather standing or sitting, now that's priceless!
0066620996|5.0|This was recommended to me by someone who over-hyped it.  I was not expecting much.  He was right...again! I have never owned a company, but this speaks to the middle manager as much as to the CEO.  It even speaks to the personal.  (Although I'm not sure you can throw kids off your family bus; you sort of have to wait for them to graduate first.) <br /> <br />The amount of research that must have gone into this book is just amazing.  It made me look at the office I was building and determine what kind of legacy I wanted after I was gone and what kind of manager I wanted to be.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I have been following PT since about 1994 when The Sky Moves Sideways came out. Being a long time fan of the group Japan I have tried to follow each member after that group split up. Richard Barbieri handled the synths and electronics for Japan so I decided to check out PT. I have to say that I was amazed at how good these guys are and have bought everything they have put out since. They are a vital group the likes of Pink Floyd and King Crimson yet they are young and still in the midst of putting out their classic work right now. It amazes me that they are not more well known. If their catalog had been coming out in the 70's they may well have eclipsed all other bands. I compare them to these bands yet keep in mind Porcupine Tree has a contemporary sound , even futuristic in some cases. They are stunningly original and represent a welcome sign of intelligent life in an otherwise superficial music industry. I can't think of any other young band that has not only musical skill but more importantly the imagination and taste that PT consistently exhibits. Most groups would have screwed something up with the type of music that PT has created. I hear other bands that you might compare PT to but they always miss the mark due to bad vocals or overdoing their musical themes. PT on the other hand somehow manage to pull off consistent , challenging, and imaginative music along with great vocals. There is remarkably no filler in any of their songs in my opinion , even the complex cuts. The main reason for this is that these guys have a great understanding of what not to do with their music as well as what to do with it. In short they know exactly what their fans want to hear , imagine that. <br /> <br />That brings us to this new release \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\". The buzz has been out there for the last 6 months or so. The main question was usually revolving around how they could possibly live up to their previous release \\"Deadwing\\" which was a groundbreaker; even though theyalready had numerous groundbreakers under their belts that most people had no awareness of. Folks, Fear of a Blank Planet hits the mark in a big way. I have to admit that I too was wondering how they would follow up Deadwing. I have been following many bands over the years and this is a legitimate question because there is a history of most bands jumping the shark after about 5 releases. I could name off tons of groups that lost their muse after about 5 recordings but why bother. <br /> <br />Without going into great detail on each song I can attest that if you like Porcupine Tree you will love this new release. It is in line with what makes the band so appealing to fans of imaginitive music making. The production is peerless and the songs are never boring and excellently realised. Some things that happen in a song or two catch you off guard , creativity in other words. The song getting the most acclaim is the 17:42 minute long \\"Anesthetize\\". This song seems like it is about 8 minutes long because PT take you on an exiting ride with this piece. They hit about every PT musical element you can think of and it is a mind blower. Guest guitarist Alex Lifeson from Rush peels off an excellent solo in one of the songs many twists and turns. You have to hear it! Another guest is the one and only King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp on \\"Way Out of Here\\". This is another stunning piece. The guitar production in general is very vivid on this disk. Steven Wilson is truly establishing himself as the music industry's reigning evil genius. His other band Blackfield is no slouch either, one wonders how he does it. <br /> <br />Buy this now!!!
B000002KMY|5.0|This was the album that attracted me to the Dio-fronted Sabbath. At first it seems to follow the blueprint set by Heaven and Hell, being a blend of fast tracks (Turn Up the Night, Mob Rules), ballads (Sign of the Southern Cross, Falling Off the Edge of the World) and midtempo rockers (Slipping Away, Country Girl). Martin Birch again produced this album. Nevertheless, the sound of the album is distinguishably gloomier, than its predecessor's. As founding drummer Bill Ward departed in the middle of the Heaven and Hell tour, ex-Rick Derringer's drummer Vinny Appice was recruited to the drum stool. The album's mood set by the brilliant cover art (Greg Hildebrandt's painting originally called \\"The Mob Dream\\") is also different than on Heaven and Hell. Some songs such as Country Girl and Voodoo show bluesy approach reminding of old Sabbath. There is also almost psychedelic bass-based intro to the title track, later used in the live show. The band seems to stick to the proven formula while expanding it on new approaches of the songwriting. Dio-penned lyrics once again are fitting greatly to the music, although this time they seem to be more down to earth. With two albums under their belt, they toured extensively, incorporating many new as well as classic songs in the live set as shown on the Live Evil album. Sadly, as the position of Dio in the band became more established this ultimately led to the clash of egos that ended this lineup a year later. While the original version of Black Sabbath always will be the ultimate one, this incarnation produced great music, and proved to be relevant and influential enough to inspire two eventual stints: the Dehumanizer album and tour and the recent Heaven and Hell 2007 tour.

B000002KKS|5.0|In just about every review of Heaven and Hell (The Black Sabbath LP of 1980) I saw the following info tidbits:<br /><br />1. This record is the first after kicking out Ozzy - the original frontman.<br /><br />2. Iommi and Dio wrote the song Children of the Sea at their first jam session together.<br /><br />3. Craig Gruber (a former bandmate of Dio in Elf and the first lineup of Rainbow) and Geoff Nicholls (ex-Quartz) were supposed to play bass instead of the briefly departed Geezer Butler. Eventually Geoff Nicholls came up with the bass line to the title track.<br /><br />4. This is the only record Bill Ward has done with Dio.<br /><br />5. Unlike the previous albums where the majority of lyrics were written by the occultist Geezer Butler, the Heaven and Hell's lyrics were penned by Dio in his dungeons and dragons style well matching with the musical direction of the band.<br /><br />  There are some things that distinguish this album and put a sharp border between anything that the Sabs did before and after it. While Ozzy-fronted albums usually start with midtempo tracks (Black Sabbath, War Pigs, Sweet Leaf, etc...), Neon Knights is quite fast and intense. Instead of self-producing the album, the band worked with well-established producer Martin Birch (Deep Purple, Rainbow, etc.). This probably has a lot to do with the overall sound being clear and more in-your-face than the previous two records. Apart from the fast rockers Neon Knights, Wishing Well and Lady Evil, this album presents the ballads Children of the Sea and Lonely is the World. The epic title track is mostly bass-driven with heavy choruses and fades out with an acoustic outro. This album is well balanced and in fact sets the standard for both its follower (Mob Rules) and a respectable portion of Dio solo albums (Holy Diver, Last in Line, etc.). The new Black Sabbath was safely placed  among the metal bands of the day (both with NWOBHM pioneers like Iron Maiden and more traditional like Judas Priest). The Castle 1996 remaster does a fine job for the sound and brings the lyrics together with liner-notes by Hugh Gilmour.  The album as well as this lineup of Sabbath proved to be quite an influential one for others being an inspiration for the epic-, symphonic- and power-metal bands (like Helloween or Rhapsody). The potential of Black Sabbath with Dio was to be explored in two more stints following the 1982 split-up, the most recent being the Heaven and Hell 2007 tour. Hopefully this line-up will produce more good music for us to consume!!!!e 1996 remaster does a fine job for the sound and brings the lyrics together with liner-notes by Hugh Gilmour.

B000O174CM|1.0|It would make you forget this 2007 reinterpretation so fast your head would spin.  Movie does NOT catch the flavor of the 60s at all.  Or ANY of the charisma of the original.  Totally different.  You now know less than when you started.
0767817478|1.0|I am a big G-fan, and not all his movies are cheesy like stupid Americans claim. In fact. They now use great CGI effects, especially in Films like GMK and Godzilla vs.Destroyah. The acting is not good. The characters are cardboard cutouts, could be easily copied and pasted into any random \\"Sci-fi channel Un-original Movie\\"
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Haven't even heard the latest album(Beale St) but I also love CLUTCH. What makes it so easy to openly accept them is they are are so talented at every instrument, play so tightly together, and make you forget about your suroundings and previous musical anticipations while leaving you in a state of... \\"this is f'in great music - who is this again?\\" - to quote a few friends. <br /> <br />\\"Everything's gonna be alright\\" <br /> <br />Joe
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I don't mean \\"funny - ha ha.\\"  Just \\"funny.\\"  I read great reviews about this film so I took it out from the library.  I was immediately drawn into it, mostly by the presence of the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a very appealing young actor.  As I watched it all I could think of was how times had changed since I went to high school...!  Yeah, everyone knows kids do drugs now but the extremity of the plot and the violence...Well, I know it was Los Angeles, but still... <br /> <br />Call me Gramma Moses or something but it defied reality for me.  I know kids (excuse me for using this term, but they are supposed to be high school age so I don't know what else to call them) are smart these days but this smart?  Gee, who writes their dialog?  <br /> <br />I agree with others that the lead is miscast.  Charming and cute as he is, he didn't seem street-smart and tough as I guess he was supposed to be.  He seemed like a bookish, serious type who is never too far away from his glasses.  (It's amazing that his glasses survived through all of the physical abuse he took.)  It was just not believable to me that such a sweet, physically frail looking guy would put himself in such horrendous danger over and over.  I kept wondering where his parents were?  Did he have any?  He really looked like a nice boy from a nice home who would probably be going to an Ivy League school the next year.  <br /> <br />Ok, so it wasn't supposed to be realistic but it was shot in a realistic way and that's what made it not really work for me.  It wasn't \\"noir\\" in the sense of the classic noir films. It is shot in sunny southern California, in brilliant color.  In classic noir films the people are hard nosed middle aged types, not fresh faced innocents like most of these kids.  (The hero doesn't even smoke!)   <br /> <br />I did turn the subtitles on and it helped.  Mostly I could follow the plot but sometimes the names were too confusing....the Pin, Tug, Dode, etc.  Some of the dialogue, even with thesubtitles, was completely incomprehensible.  The charm of Gordon-Levitt did keep me caring, through all of the plot twists and carnage.  But, ten minutes after the film was over, I stopped caring...make that five minutes. <br /> <br />I give it four stars because, well I guess I was impressed by it, but then I'm probably too easily impressed. Anyway the acting is very good.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have been using AKG headphones since the mid 70's when I started seeing them on the heads of every entertainer in the recording studio environment in film and television.  This said volumes to me about the acceptance by the real professionals. Bought my first pair back then and have had them over the years, occassionally upgrading to newest technology model. I happened to be in the discotheque business back then and I bought AKG's for DJ use in all six of our clubs throughout the country. These are fantastic with full range of natural sound from lows to highs. Does not color the sound and they really kick if you loop them through EQ. Ain't nothin' better. I am so spoiled that sometimes I prefer listening to concert DVD's with these on rather than listening \\"full room\\" with my very expensive and well appointed home component audio system. And I occassionally go back to my original set of AKG's purchased in 1976 and they still sound awesome, although the rubber ear pads have become rather hardened and I cant wear them for long. My only complaint about this new pair of \\"around the ear\\" phones is that you tend to sweat a bit after wearing them through a movie. I also have a set of fairly recent model 141's that are the \\"on the ear\\" smaller pad model with very soft foam pads and I must say that I probably prefer them to the full ear enclosure, for that reason. Other than that, you can't beat the undisputed champ in headphone sound, and at an amazing price point for the quality of the sound.
B000O75F7C|5.0|PT seemingly can do no wrong. Steve Wilson is always at his best with PT rather than the side projects which aren't bad but always over-rated. This is another step up the progressive ladder for them. It has all the post-in Absentia trademarks; the not too overly hard metal prog sound mixed with slower beautiful acoustical keyboard passages. I do have to agree with other reviews that the lyrics are somewhat simplistic in content. Nothing that deep to be found here but who cares, it's still great to listen to.  <br />    <br />   I like this cd a lot yet I can't help but feel that Deadwing will end up being their masterpiece.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I am the proud owner of every studio cd Mr. Vai has ever released and I can honestly say that this may be my favorite.  Overall the guitar playing is amazing as always.  Steve has total command over not just his speed, like some of the other \\"shredders\\" he's often classified with, but the perfect tone and grace of every note he plays, no matter how fast or slow.  <br />       The whole \\"concept\\" of this concept album is kind of interesting, although somewhat difficult to follow. but it's cool how the whole album, as you follow it, sticks with a mood and gradually takes you down this strange musical path.  His song-writing on this album is fantastic and very melodic. <br /> <br />Building the Church starts with an insane 2-handed tapping intro in a style I'd never really heard before, then continues into a very well written melody that, to me, never gets old. <br /> <br />Dying For Your Love is a vocal song, without much flashy guitar.  One of the weaker songs, in my opinion, but kind of pleasant.  <br /> <br />Glorious is quite cool.  The lead guitar line is played on a fretless guitar with a wah-pedal. Kinda sounds like a cat that can really sing. A nice solo in the middle of this one too. <br /> <br />K'm-pee-du-wee is a slow yet very tender ballady song that was meant to sound like a guitar singing a lullaby. beautiful guitar phrasing in this one. <br /> <br />Firewall was another vocal song, which, again, is not my favorite side of Steve. But it's tolerable and the solo, makes it worth it. <br /> <br />Freak Show Excess speaks for itself. It's kind of a fun song and the outro solo is insane-absolutely insane. <br /> <br />Lotus Feet is done with just Steve and an orchestra. Steve really uses the guitar as his voice in this song. You can almost hear it speaking, rather than playing. <br /> <br />Yai Yai is interesting, kinda weird. Completely done with the \\"yah-yah\\" feature. <br /> <br />I'm Your Secrets is all acoustic and although Steve sings in this one too, Ifind it quite lovely.  The accoustic melody is really captivating. <br /> <br />Under It All is the most interesting if you're following the storyline of the cd.  It has all the characters making little speeches and like the rest of the cd, the melody of the song itself is rather captivating. <br /> <br />Overall, like I said, it's not his flashiest playing, but it's definitely enough that guitar players will be happy.  I consider it his most melodic song writing he's ever done.  And yes; Steve is weird.  He's always been weird, he'll always be weird.  If you like his weirdness, you will love this cd.  Enjoy, friends. <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles have been a longstanding arena \\"country-rock\\" band, and even though Don Felder's missed, Frey, Henley, Walsh and Schmidt make up for it with their harmonies and the guitar player is definitely capable. It is really cool to hear them playing the solo stuff. Hopefully Joe also captured some of the James Gang reunion shows last year.  <br /> <br />Only complaint about the Eagles I've had was wondering why they didn't tour with Randy Meisener and Bernie Leadon, and resurrect some of the pre-\\"Hotel California\\" gems, and it gives them an excuse for the band to do a Flying Burritos song. Glenn Frey singing \\"Take it to the Limit\\" just isn't the same. There were also shows filmed in the 70s, and I'm hoping they wind up being released.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, this is great.
B000O178BY|3.0|Let me start off by stating that Trent Reznor will always be an artistic genius.  He has managed to stay wholly original while still sounding like Nine Inch Nails.  With that being said, I feel that Nine Inch Nails has gone in a direction that I cannot follow.  Also, when listening to this album, I feel as if I should be living in a futuristic, white pod-house...I would actually give it a 2.5 if I could...
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is the greatest Hammer film ever made. Starring the two mainstays of British Horror Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.<br /><br />Terence Fisher (the best Hammer director) directs with style and James Bernard produced a score that would be used in variations by many Hammer films over the years. For any musicians out there the chord Bernard uses to signal Dracula's presence is an augmented chord...<br /><br />Christopher Lee is magnificent as Count Dracula. Bela Lugosi may have starred in the role first but Lee is vastly superior in every respect: He has more screen presence (helped by being 6' 5\\"), is better looking and most crucially unlike Lugosi he can act.<br /><br />As Van Helsing Peter Cushing is mesmerising. Whether he is carrying out a blood transfusion or dictating into an early phonograph recorder, the script is delivered with absolute conviction. I always end up believing vampires exist after watching this film!<br /><br />The ending to this film is perhaps the single greatest moment in the entire history of Hammer films. While the special effects look dated now the realisation of the ending is just a great piece of film making.
B000O178BY|3.0|Year Zero is a political notion, but not something Trent Reznor invented. Please check with Wikipedia. Canadian journalist Naomi Klein criticized the United States' post war plan in Iraq in her 2004 article titled \\"Baghdad Year Zero\\", which can be found at the Harpers website.    Reznor said \\"This record began as an experiment with noise on a laptop in a bus on tour somewhere\\" and \\"This record is much more of a \\"sound collage\\" than recent efforts from me\\". Well, this album indeed sounds like he made in a laptop, and not much more than a sound collage. Noises don't blend with each other failing to build soundscapes, and sound obnoxious rather than disturbing. Many songs have the same beats, sound so similar to each other, and remind me of old work by other artists especially from 80s. I know I'm not the only person who remembers Marilyn Manson every time I hear \\"Capital G\\", and I'm not even a MM fan. He used to make music no one had made or heard before, but this album is exactly the opposite.     It's been said this is a concept album with political messages that tells a story of what might happen in the next fifteen years because of political apathy, greed, and arrogance. However, Reznor's vision of apocalypse/dystopia never feels real enough but rather looks like a Hollywood Sci-Fi movie (with impressive SFX and a very poor screenplay) or video game (with a reset button). I'm from a country with history of militarism/totalitarianism, and compared to the darkest time of our history or even what's been happening in Iraq because of the US, Year Zero just looks like a black comedy. And Reznor doesn't sound like he's actually in it, but like he's watching it from somewhere higher and safe. \\"The Good Soldier\\" never sounds like he's going to snap at any moment, or gives me chill like Kate Bush's \\"Pull Out The Pin\\" did about 20 years ago.     This album is still better than the disastrous With Teeth, and Reznor was more assured what he wanted to say this time. But I strong believe he should have taken more time, like another year, to make this record. Year Zero could have been much better if he had let each song develop into something more complex with sounsdcapes and melodies (or, is this because Danny Lohner or Charlie Clouser no longer works with him?), and the concept into more intelligent and mature. Unlike his old work in which he wrote songs based on his personal experiences, he tried to write from others' view points. While I want to give him some credits for trying something new and perhaps more difficult, I don't think he did a good job here. A good actor can play a serial killer and looks believable without killing anyone, but it also takes lots of research, imagination and skills. Trent never gave a s**t to politics until a few years ago, and I don't think he'd done enough homework in history, politics, psychology, etc. before building up the concept. Teenagers in middle-class America may be impressed, but I'm neither American nor that young. I also question whether this fast-paced dance-pop style was a really good choice for this kind of concept. You can dance non-stop, but would barely stop to think. Reznor said \\"You can dance to a lot of it. You can f*** to a lot of it\\". Ironically, this comment shows how little he knows about the real world because sex is often just another form of power and violence in real wars.      I haven't been following the ARG things, and probably never will. I thought the viral marketing would have some meaning only if the music is very good, but the album turned out to be rather disappointing. Does Reznor really think it will influence the real world? Or does he just want to be hailed as a rebel leader or something by his fans young enough to be his own kids? It looks like his avid fans are just spending more time in the Internet solving the puzzles or making those AIR patches and flags. This is just another form of entertainment and escapism to me. How many of them actually have read NaomiKlein's article? It's said he hired the marketing company called 42 Entertainment for this viral campaign, but which cost more, the making of the album itself or the marketing it? I guess he spends way too much time playing video games.     This is still a progress from the previous work, but I really hope the next album, which is said to be the sequel of Year Zero, to be something more mature and intelligent that adults can appreciate.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is great stuff. The original album needs no introduction every track is a winner - its a 5 star album. From Thunder Road to Jungleland via Backstreets this is one of the great Springsteen albums. Perhaps what make this album standout from other Springsteen albums is its epic scale. This isn't prog-rock though, despite the length of some of the tracks. As I think Springsteen once said, he was trying to capture the drive of the Rolling Stones (at there early 70's peak), with the voice of Roy Orbison, and the production of Phil Spector. An ambitious combination, but the result is worth it.<br /><br />The documentary DVD is interesting, but you may only watch it once - however documentaries are very subjective and what I found uninteresting you may love.<br /><br />The concert DVD as other people have said is a bit dark! However, the performances are excellent, the E Street band are on fire, and I found it enthralling to see (or not!) Bruce and the band 30 years ago performing with such passion.<br /><br />If you haven't already got Born to Run you should buy this, if you have, do what I did and get as a birthday present.
B00005JLH3|1.0|Have you ever wondered why there has never been a movie made about a championship high school chess team? Because no one would watch it and no one would care. I find Drumline amazing for many reasons. The first reason is that this is a feature film with a subject I could not care less about. Not only that, but when the movie was over I was even LESS interested in marching bands.<br /><br />Another thing I find amazing is the star of the movie Nick Cannon. How does this talented actor keep the same stupid look on his face throughout the entire movie? That is the pure skill and talent of a seasoned thesbian. I think he must be an amazing actor to portray someone who cannot act. Absolutly incredible.<br /><br />The grand finale of the flick has the buildup of a Rocky movie. Drumoff competitions? To each his own. I walked away from this movie with nothing. Sorry, it did nothing for me.
B00000099Y|5.0|A masterpiece, not an opinion but a fact. Like most TOOL albums this one takes a few listens before its beauty is absorbed. Progressive rock at its finest. Emotional rollercoaster, shiver down your spine stuff. One musical climax after another. Vocalist James Maynard Keenan at the peak of his powers, angry,sad,every word a bold statement. The balance between instrument and vocal is perfect. Anyway millions of reviews regard this record so its all been said. Buy it, if not watch a Rambo movie.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This movie was a beautifully, fully realized portrait of a public figure.  Instead of the cardboard cliches you see in so many film biographies, this movie takes one short--yet totally life altering--period in a historical figure's life (Queen Elizabeth) and as a result it is more revealing than most films that try to portray a full life.  The script deserves much praise for it many nuances.  Especially touching was the metaphor of the hunted animal on the Queen's estate.  Helen Mirren is simply wonderful.  Her performance has many moments of subtle brilliance--often conveyed with delicate facial expressions--breaking through the mask--reacting to the complicated situations she is faced with.  I think this film has done a lot for the real Queen's reputation.  It humanizes her in a totally realistic but sympathetic light. Yet it is always absorbing and entertaining.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Some may say GNRs music is dated. Maybe true. Make no mistake in the late 80s early 90s GNR were one of the most fresh,hardhitting,and well known metal bands on the planet. Exploding onto the seen amongst the glossy hair metal genre(which they helped end)GNR were ruff, raw, they drunk, smoked and delivered lightening guitar riffs and screaming vocals. Metal had seen such rawness before (Iron Maiden,Judus Priest) but it had been many years and never so burtal. Put simply most of  their best work appears on this album. Its not perfect, no \\"Greatest Hits\\" are (reason for 4 star rating) but I think most GNR fans would agree with the song selections here. Most \\"Greatest Hits\\" are cheap and miss the musical point. This captures one of the finest metal bands of all time well and is a satisfying listen and a highly recommended buy.YOZA
B00005JPD0|4.0|I enjoyed Deja Vu quite a bit.  I really did not know anything about it beforehand, except for the title and that Denzel Washinton was in it. Now I am glad that I got to find out everything as the story unfolded on the screen, naive to the time concept central to the plot. Anyway, that is how Doug Carlin (Denzel's character) would have experienced it (ironically, though), so it was easier for me to put myself in his place--to discover evidence with him, to be surprised by the same events that he was, etc.     Therefore, I won't tell you very much about it, except that I was pleasantly surprised.  The opening scenes have some compelling shots that draw you into the story, and it isn't complicated to follow, but, at the same time, it is a smart film, in it's own way.  No one really completely understands about the \\"true\\" science of this anyway, so it is interesting to explore \\"what ifs\\". I saw at least one angle on the topic that was new to me.      I also liked how Agent Carlin fell in love before he \\"met\\" Claire and how he seemed to be compelled to save her at great risk to himself, as if he somehow knew that she belonged with him.
B00003CXUM|5.0|i have to say the film was one of my faves. when i read the plot outline i saw it was boring and slow and dumb and i thought \\"pfff i aint buyin this!\\" but then i watched a commercial for it (yea im obsessed w/ commercials) and just in the commercial itself the cinimatography (sp?) was AMAZING. <br />the film was slow and if wong kar-wai wanted, he could do the same story in 30 minutes but it would never ever meet the graceful and elegant movie here. the slowness is not boring but enchanting and beautiful. its a film of its own kind. i strongly sujest it.
B00005JPPL|3.0|Cris Johnson ,a two-bit Las Vegas magician whose \\"nom de plume\\" is Frankie Cadillac, has a most unusual gift since birth: he sees two minutes into the future.It has served him handily at gambling and other things such as wrestling a gun from a would-be shooter,etc.  but Cris (Nicholas Cage) has been picked apart for this gift all his life and he wants to be left alone with it.Enter FBI operative Callie Ferris (the ever lovely Julianne Moore)who,following Cris for a while, tries to convince him to work in cahoots with her and the Bureau to reach a nuclear bomb before annihilation occurs.Cris goes on the run and encounters first, Lizzie (Jessica Biel) a really ridiculously good character who helps underprivileged children, and secondly the terrorists who want to find   Cris so that their  plans to blow up everything are not thwarted.I submit that this is an accurate yet superficial plot summary. <br /> <br />Apart from the neat concept of the \\"two minutes ahead\\" theory, this film just has so many holes in it, that as in time-travelish films a certain degree of belief has to be suspended.This requires way more suspension  than that! Moore's character has figured out the \\"two minute\\" thing.We never know how. Cris' powers become way more advanced in Biel's presence.No clue-never explained.The \\"terrorists\\" want to blow things up, but we are never told  to why .Is two minutes warning really enough time in the first place to even defuse this bomb? The worst part,though, are the endless chases that Cage endures.Once or twice is fine,but it gets a little predictable and ho-hum after a while,and Cage NEVER even looks tired! <br /> <br />NEXT is nothing at all special.It may engage and entertain for a while,but little more than that. Cage,Moore and Biel have done so much better work with better material.The biggest surprise to me was that this was a product of director Lee Tamahori whose STATE OF THE UNION and DIE ANOTHER DAY were so taught.NEXT had me simply saying,I hope what's next is better than this.I can't see two minutes ahead.
0143036742|5.0|This book is unique.  It's certainly comic as it tells the story of an 84 year old Ukrainian immigrant living in England who, after his beloved wife dies, marries a 36-year old blonde Ukrainian bombshell who wants to escape her life in the Ukraine and acquire all the material things the West has to offer and she is crude and exploitive in every way.  The old man adores her though and puts up with all her verbal abuse and impossible demands.  His two adult daughters, however, see things from a different point of view and encourage him divorce his young wife.<br /><br />Written in the first person in the voice of one of the daughters, this book got my attention by its outrageous theme and at first I laughed out loud.  But soon there was insight and depth as the characters developed and the complex thread of family relationships were explored  The family has been living in the U.K. since the end of WWII, but one of the daughters was born in the Ukraine and grew up with the horrors of the war.  The second daughter, and the narrator of the book, was born later in the U.K., a baby boomer who grew up believing in banning the bomb and the peace movement.  The daughters view their father's new wife with horror and so did I.  Eventually though, there is a shift in understanding.<br /><br />The title is the name of a book that the elderly father is writing.  He is a former engineer and very interested in tractors.  In between the external story, there are portions of the book that talk about these tractors.  I found these parts interesting because I never though of tractors as being instrumental in influencing major changes in the world.  I also learned a bit about the Ukraine and the hardships the people have lived through.  But this is a modern book, and I couldn't help chuckling at the viewpoint of the new immigrant who sees \\"boil in the bag\\" frozen dinners as an ultimate symbol of modernity.<br /><br />The book is only 293 pages and a fast read. Once started, though, I couldn't put it down and I didn't even mind the outrageousness of the plot; I just accepted it for the satire that it is. When I finished it I was smiling, not just because it ended happy with everything tied up in a neat little package, but because I gained empathy and understanding along the way.  That is a big feat for a new author.  I applaud her for it.ough, I couldn't put it down and I didn't even mind the outrageousness of the plot; I just accepted it for the satire that it is.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a must-see film, one that will shake your understanding of the world we live in. It details exactly what global warming is and why we need to be worried about it. On that count it's nearly perfect, with a powerful argument. <br /> <br />Where it falls short is in providing solutions. You get grim prediction after grim prediction, but only a few seconds of what we might do to avert disaster. For that, you ought to see any of the new pantheon of environmental problem-solving books like[[ASIN:0896087794 Heat: How to Stop the Planet From Burning]], [[ASIN:1933045256 Design Like You Give a Damn: Architectural Responses to Humanitarian Crises]], [[ASIN:0805076263 Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future]] or [[ASIN:0810930951 Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century]] (which Gore himself wrote the forward for).

0440237688|5.0|I read this book about 5 years ago at the age of 12 or a little younger. I thought It was amazing. I love the \\"utopian\\" community idea Lowry used. I loved how the boy in the story was the only one who got to see the memories of colorful sailboats and happy thoughts and music. I cried when the boy gave the baby a memory of a colorful sailboat to comfort him. The last chapter is my absolute favorite. I really do advise you to read this book and other books by Lois Lowry. I'm also in love with her book Gathering Blue which has the same \\"utopian\\" society. I read that book years ago too and fell in love with it. Come to think of it I should reread it sometime.<br /><br />thank you for you time,<br /><br />Loran<br /><br />p.s.- definitely read this book and Lowry's other book<br /><br />  Gathering Blue.
1400063515|5.0|As most movie goers have from experience, most sequels are o.k., but rarely better. In the case of \\"The Black Swan\\", I can clearly state, as others have, that Mr. Taleb pulled the rabbit and bettered his earlier \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" which was already a great book on uncertainty and failures of Gaussian (i.e. Bell Curve) probabilities as an application.<br /><br />Though the Bell Curve can explain many activities that are in relative equilibrium, it does not fit well with real day-to-day observations like the weather, markets, wealth distribution, bacteria growth, and etceteras. That is because we live in a world that is getting more complex and more \\"recursive\\" (i.e. contains feedback loops) every day. As the recursiveness gets more intertwined in society, the power laws tend to place us in the critical state which is  a prime and fruitful place for Mr. Teleb's Black Swans. The fruitful place discussed is in Extremistan and far away from the Gaussian place that many (if not all) of us have been taught much of our lives. Within Extremistan, thought models of 4,5, or 6 sigma events are not applicable and lead one into a false sense of security.<br /><br />As our world in which our evolutionary machinery has made us gullible to many topics as examples of, anchoring, narrative fallacy, confirmation errors, envy, and combinational probabilities (as well as many others), knowing that we don't know what we don't know is a start in the search (and protection) from Black Swans. If you liked the 1st book, you should love the sequel as a more critical narrative will keep you entertained for hours and hopefully better prepare you for a more recursive society to come.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I've been a Stevie fanatic since she began with Fleetwood Mac, so anything new from Stevie is a must buy.   <br /> <br />The live version of Edge of 17, from Australia, is excellent. <br /> <br />But the true greatness of this package is the DVD.  To see the videos again is priceless and to see the much talked about Civil War Epic version of Stand Back is truly awesome.
B000HCO840|4.0|I loved the first two movies. Exciting, great effects, cool characters, terrific stories... then you come to that 'awkward third album'... And yes it is awkward. But not a disaster by any reckoning. The story is good, the effects better than ever, the characters dynamic. So what's the problem? They simply try to squeeze too much in. There are loads of new characters, all demanding their air time, with the result that there simply isn't enough time for everyone to get a decent crack at things. It would've been far better so cut some of the minor characters to give the leads more time. Plus, some of the editing decisions are VERY questionable. For example, the battle at Jean Grey's house involving Wolverine and Storm... well, in the movie, it looks like they lose it to me. Not what you expect from your heroes. BUT... stick on the extra features and see the extended scene, however, and you get a very different picture. And a far, far superior scene. The finale has some similarly baffling editing.  <br /> <br />So, when the action scenes are questionable, and the main characters don't get enough screen time, is it any wonder the movie didn't come up to expectations?  <br /> <br />All this said, it's still a great movie. Not a triumph, but a worthy addition to the franchise. <br />
0060531053|5.0|I've been homebrewing for a year now, and I have used this book extensively during that time.  In fact, I still use this book.  It is full of all sorts of helpful information and techniques.  Also, it provides good background information.  This can be used as a sort of manual for homebrewing but it can also simply be read; some of the stuff in the book is fascinating even if you're not ready to start brewing yet.  This book can easily get you through your first couple years of homebrewing without the need for additional sources.  For those of you who are jsut starting, best of luck!

B00005JPOE|5.0|As most of the reviews here are complimentary (as opposed to at Hollywood video, I would like to respond to some of the criticism found there. Sorry, this movie does not have a whole lot of car (carriage) chases, houses afire,  sordid sex scenes or other Hollywood staples). What it does have is heart. William Wilberforce almost single-handedly stood up against a noxious totally-ingrained-social institution and changed the world. This accomplishment was executed quite well in the movie. True, 'Amazing Grace,' does chronicle the end of slavery in Britain (and years before the Americans saw the light, at that), but it does so much more. By the way, Ioan Gruffudd performed beautifully.<br />  As to the take-away value for today; Are we today overwhelmed by certain noxious-totally ingrained-social-institutions?<br />Oh yeah. How to prioritize them: Consumerism, oil dependency, corporate malfeasance, and the sensationalism rampant in the press all make life less than it could be.<br />  The champions standing up for new directions on all these fronts can take a page from Wilberforce's book. As to the title of this critique, Margaret Mead's full comment was \\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever does.\\"
B000000OQF|5.0|My brother purchased this album before I did -- and he was five years younger than me, still in grade school while I was in high school. Apparently he was a little less intimidated by the sound and aura of Guns `n Roses than me. To be sure, I loved the songs off \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" but somehow felt like bringing this album home from the store would get me in trouble or soil me in some way. Sure, Axl Rose's snaky voice and the alarming lyrics on the hit song \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" would set anyone on edge, but the commanding \\"F*** off!\\" heard by the singer on the album's second song, \\"It's So Easy,\\" along with the startlingly brash lyrics heard on the rest of that tune (and throughout the album), were pretty dangerous stuff to my sophomore-in-high-school ears. Axl's over-the-top persona and G `n Rs' antics over the succeeding years would intermittently turn me off at times, but all this time later I can really, really appreciate this awesome album.<br /><br />Def Leppard's [[ASIN:B000001F2V Pyromania]] album from the 1980s featured masterful twin guitar work by Steve Clark and Phil Collen. Hook after hook on that album won listeners over. G `n R guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin were magical on this album also, but in a different way than Clark and Collen. \\"Appetite\\" is less about hooks and more about abandonment and rough-edged rock and roll that forces you to pay attention. The flexing, heavy-hitting power chords by Stradlin that intermingled with the oily guitar leads of Slash are way more complex than you might think, and if you listen hard enough to the fiery guitars on this album, you'll hear something new every time.<br /><br />Steven Adler's drumming was later criticized by others in the band, perhaps due to his bad drug habit, but \\"Appetite\\" has some of the best \\"air drum\\" moments in the history of rock and roll. I find myself stomping the kick drum, hitting the cow bell, high hat and snare on such greats as \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" and \\"Rocket Queen\\" with just as much abandon as Adler himself.<br /><br />Axl was a vocal chameleon behind the microphone, high-pitched and wailing on many songs and bizarrely sounding like a croaky grandmother on others. His powerful vocals on the chorus of \\"My Michelle\\" are infectiously contagious. The sentimental \\"Think About You\\" is the perfect lead-in song to the even more sentimental \\"Sweet Child o' Mine,\\" one of the best rock songs ever recorded. \\"You're Crazy\\" and \\"Anything Goes,\\" also great, rocking tunes, sum up the classic G `n R persona, and the album's closer, \\"Rocket Queen,\\" ends \\"Appetite\\" on a strong, melodic note, somewhat in the vain of \\"Sweet Child of Mine's.\\" reflective way.<br /><br />Swagger, soul, abandonment, grit, feeling. Hard rock music at its best. Twelve songs that will fly by and you'll want to hear them again. I'm glad I kind of came of age when G `n R debuted at the top of the world. They should make a movie about these guys, or at least make a documentary about the late-`80s era they represented with such recklessness.Mine\\" and \\"Rocket Queen\\" with just as much abandon as Adler himself.

6304779356|4.0|Reading these reviews, it's clear that \\"The Lost Boys\\" has some irresistable magic going for it; I've loved it ever since I saw it in the theater when it came out. The '80's trappings are at least authentic, as the film was made in 1986 when the splashy colors of Corey Haim's shirts were actually chic (believe it, kiddies, I was there).  <br /> <br />But what really makes it work, I think, is the care the writer (or writers) took to get the details of vampire mythology - the \\"hellhound\\", the importance of inviting the vampire into the home - right even as they re-shaped it to fit the contemporary setting. The twists all work, and the ending is just brilliant (\\"..all the damn vampires\\"). It's a solidly entertaining and engaging horror film, possibly deserving a place in a \\"top ten\\" of the genre.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|This album saw Kansas change there lineup. The addition of Steve Morse gave them one hell of an axeman. Listen to the solo at the end of Track 1, Silouettes in Disguise and you'll see what I mean. Most early Kansas albums had a couple of tracks that were listenable but the remainder of the album would contain songs that were too long and would make the listener lose interest. With this album they only did it once. It is an album that is more mainstream rock with Kansas' edge. I believe this to be their best album, yet when you see any compilation albums, this material is left off. Too bad. Bottom line though...Do yourself a favor and get this album and you won't be disappointed. I wore the cassette out when this was first released in the mid-80's and was pleased to finally see it on CD.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|The animation is as good as any classic Disney. But the story is outdated.<br /><br />This movie is quite telling of its time. Some folks who say they love it scare me about as much as the old Soviet propaganda I grew up with. It was also \\"wholesome\\" back then.<br /><br />Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan perfectly captures the tragedy of a child who had to mature and take on adult responsibilities too soon. When in the middle of the final fight with Hook Wendy implores him to fly and he responds that he can't because he \\"gave his word\\" it's just heartbreaking. Those of us who grew up in the 70s were just lucky to have that burden lifted and have normal prolonged childhoods.<br /><br />And while Peter Pan is too adult, Hook in this version seems rather childish. Like the most spoiled kid you can imagine, Hook is a mean-spirited bully who constantly whines and throws tantrums. The worst punishment for him is the public humiliation of being called a codfish. He even escapes the crocodile in the end.<br /><br />Smee is the ultimate Disney sidekick, a stuttering moron who can't get anything right, a subservient character bullied by all the other pirates.<br /><br />Wendy is so proper for the 50s and so out of date today. A girl who knows her place and just talks too much to avoid thinking about that. She can deal with other girls and play a mother to the boys but she knows it's a man's world.<br /><br />What makes the red man red? That's how it was, and that view is definitely outdated as well, but you can't cut an essential part of the movie out.<br /><br />The crocodile is the most wonderful thing in this movie, most adorable. And he swims to a great song too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a classic movie worth seeing, but I would hesitate to show it to small kids. I think PG would be a more appropriate rating, indicating that significant portions of it would require explaining to today's child. But of course it wouldn't occur to the Disney corporation to do a decent thing. Or perhaps they really want us to go back to the 50s.<br /><br />Some bonus features on the DVD are quite interesting, featuring Disney archives. The read-along story \\"Peter's Playful Prank\\" is just horrible. There are so many things wrong with that story...
0385338082|1.0|This a rip off of the Bridget Jones series. I can just imagine the publisher nodding off to sleep while reading the rough draft. \\"Hmmm,the character is shallow,unattractive,below average in intelligence but Bridget Jones sold millions of copies so there has to be an audience for this book.\\" My daughter's book, HOP ON POP had more substance.
0552152358|4.0|Recently, I acquired a copy of the Stephen Leather thriller, [[ASIN:0340921684 Hot Blood (A Dan Shepherd Mystery)]], which had on its front cover a sticker that screamed \\"Better than Andy McNab or your money back\\". Leather's ongoing fictional hero, Dan \\"Spider\\" Shepherd, is a former member of the SAS now working for an ultra-secret undercover unit of London's Metropolitan Police. Nick Stone, the protagonist making his initial appearance here in McNab's first novel, REMOTE CONTROL, is an ex-SAS trooper now working for MI6. What, do Leather and McNab have a mano-a-mano thing going? (I don't ever remember seeing a Dean Koontz release with the claim, \\"King writes dross; read my stuff.\\") When queried by me, Stephen said that his publisher suggested the ploy. But, since I did end up buying REMOTE CONTROL, perhaps the point is to sell more books from both.<br /><br />Here, Stone is tasked by his SIS controller to follow two hard IRA boyos to Washington, DC, to see what mischief they're up to. Once comfortable in his hotel room, Nick is almost immediately recalled home. But, before catching the next plane back across The Pond, Stone decides to visit old SAS pal Kev, now working for the DEA. Arriving at Kev's suburban home, Nick discovers his buddy bludgeoned to death and his wife and one of two daughters with their throats cut. Stone find's the second daughter, 7-year old Kelly, cowering in a hidey-hole. Realizing that Kelly saw the killers and her life is now in peril, and that he himself may become a suspect in the bloodbath, Stone grabs the girl and runs. Over the remainder of the book, our hero must discover the identity of the murderers, protect Kelly, and get both of them to safety in England where his boss, Simmonds, will certainly sort things out.<br /><br />For a first novel, REMOTE CONTROL is better than average. McNab's personal tour of duty with the SAS imparts a patina of realism to the actions of his Stone character. Indeed, Nick is a Tough Guy in somewhat the same vein as author Lee Child's ex-Army MP, Jack Reacher. At one point in a desperate, hand-to-hand struggle with a Bad Guy over control of a pistol, Stone must essentially chew the man's face apart. Somehow, I don't see Leather's hero doing anything so messy.<br /><br />One of the criticism's I've made of the Dan Shepherd series is the fact that Spider's young son Liam is trotted out as a prop in every installment to re-emphasize that widower Shepherd is otherwise a warm, decent, family man whose day job takes him to the world's hard and grotty edges. In REMOTE CONTROL, Kelly also starts out as a prop. But, by the conclusion, she plays an integral, nail-biting, and very satisfying part. I see from plot summaries that Kelly also appears in follow-up volumes of the Nick Stone series, so I've gone ahead and ordered the second out of curiosity to see where McNab takes the character.<br /><br />The drawbacks to REMOTE CONTROL are that we've seen the scenario before in books and films - adult and child flee a deadly conspiracy hand-in-hand - and, well before the end, the coming betrayal twist becomes all to obvious.<br /><br />By profession, Stephen Leather is a journalist who's lived all over the world. McNab - a pseudonym ostensibly to protect his identity from vengeful terrorists left over from his bad old SAS days - continues to work with intelligence organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. I suspect, therefore, that Andy's books will be more realistic in the finer points, while Stephen's will show a wider scope of imagination. In any case, both are excellent British authors creating some very entertaining reads.<br /><br />Hey, Stephen and Andy, why don't you both co-author a thriller in which both Dan and Nick appear? The potential for a friendly, or not so friendly, rivalry between the two heroes is almost too good to pass up.the same vein as author Lee Child's ex-Army MP, Jack Reacher.

0375831002|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The first few pages were questionable, but <br />it was so unique to have \\"Death\\" as the narrator.  The author has a wonderful way with words and I look forward to reading his other books.  I had to compare the pages in my book to make sure that it wasn't flawed.  I thought that was an unusual technique.  I am searching for more about the author to see why he wrote this book and if there was any other personal background. <br />I was surprised that it was classified as Juvenile Literature.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|The sound quality on this CD is fantastic. The DVD is a pure stroke of genius; a DVD you don't have to watch! Shear Genius! Really, how many times do you buy a basic video to see it only once or twice? In this DVD, nothing happens so you just put it in for the great sound mix and go about what whatever you do when you listen to music. Every once in a while glance at the screen see maybe Neil's ranch, the caretaker, the dog,  Neil on stage, some vintage footage, go that's cool and go back to what you're doing. A DVD you never tire of watching. Fantastic! <br />
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Sergeant York tells the true story of Alvin York - a man whose many transitions in life culminate in a Medal of Honor for service in World War 1.  He starts as an alcoholic and streetfighter, who has developed great rifle skills while hunting.  Along the way he finds religeon, love and pacifism.  Despite the last, he is called to serve his country, and struggles with moral challenges of war.   <br /> <br />The movie is not a typical war movie by today's standards.  It takes 70 minutes to get to where he's drafted.  The preliminary scenes are more about his transitions in life, and struggle to make something of himself.  The climax is the war scene that makes him a legend.  It captures the ugliness of war without the modern technology used to make movies today.  (Certainly not a Private Ryan movie) <br /> <br />Outstanding story of heroism, and the moral conflicts of war.  The messages of the story resonate today, perhaps with just a little too much irony.
B00005JPD0|4.0|I think I will always remember watching \\"Deja Vu\\" as the moment when I realized that I was old.  Not \\"old\\" in the physical sense where I prefer to be asleep instead of awake or try to find a way to avoid walking up stairs, but \\"old\\" in the psychological sense where as you encounter others in the world around you the question that is always on your mind and threatening to come flying out of your lips is \\"What the hell is wrong with these people?\\"  I say that because for most of the first act of this 2006 film that was pretty much all I was thinking.  The film is set in New Orleans, where there is an additional insult added to injury for a city ravaged by Hurricane Katrina when a massive explosion destroys a ferry, killing more than 500 people.  We have all seen footage of police, firefighters and other first responders dealing with the aftermath of 9/11, and they were uniformly grim, angry, and determined.  But Denzel Washington's ATF agent Doug Carlin and the other main characters are cracking way too many jokes.  After all, the Big Easy is Carlin's home turf, so this has got to hurt, even before the investigation becomes decidedly personal.  I understand that his humor may be a way of dealing with the intrusion of the FBI and others who ineptitude is always bubbling dangerous close to the surface, but director Tony Scott makes it really clear that a lot of children ended up dead on the Ferry.  Every time Adam Goldberg's character cracks wise, and he has some funny lines, inside my mind I am screaming, \\"What the hell is wrong with you?  Dakota Fanning's little sister is dead!  Wipe that smile off of your face!\\"<br /><br />The good news is that \\"Deja Vu\\" digs itself out of this hole, which is pretty impressive when you consider it had one foot in the grave with me from early on.  If you have seen the trailer for \\"Deja Vu\\" then you will not be surprised that they do a similar trick during the opening credits, but beyond that point the title is something of a misnomer.  There are a few points where Carlin might be experiencing deja vu, but once he understands the big toy the special FBI squad led by Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), any feelings of having been there before are replaced by the obsession to change the past and save all of those people.  Despite the deaths of hundreds of people, for Carlin the focal point become Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), whose dead and burned body shows up on shore BEFORE the ferry exploded.  One of the things this movie does well is establish Carlin's abilities as an investigator.  Working as much by abduction as deduction and induction, Carlin knows that it was Claire's SUV that the bomber used.  He tells those in charge that if they solve her murder, they will find the bomber.<br /><br />Pryzwarra offers Carlin the opportunity to do that via what is initially described as satellite surveillance tape that was shot three days and six hours earlier.  But it does not take our hero long to figure out that satellite surveillance is not going to be able to allow him to watch Claire taking a shower when she was alive three days ago.  Then it all comes down to finding out what is possible and trying to change the past.  At this point how much you like \\"Deja Vu\\" is going to come down to whether you are a science geek, in which case the scientific explanation for time travel and its attendant paradoxes provided by the film will probably drive you to distraction, or whether you are an incurable romantic, who likes the idea of love transcending death as Carlin tries to find a way to save Claire and everybody else.  For the former what matters is the method and the ability to willingly suspend belief, while for the latter it all comes down to the payoff of the film's end game, although I would add that also coming into play is how well the payoff is set up in terms of the time loops.  Wrapping your mind around how what has not happened has already happened is part of the fun here, whatever problems you might have with the theory and practice of looking into the past as developed in the film.<br /><br />Bill Marsill, who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Rossio (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl\\"), shows up for the commentary track on the DVD and comes right out and tells us that \\"Deja Vu\\" is not so much a science fiction film as it is a love story: just one in which the first time the hero sees the girl it is at her autopsy.  I certainly agree because I kept thinking of the film \\"[[ASIN:B00008LDNZ Laura]]\\" a lot more than I did anything like \\"[[ASIN:B00006AL1E Back to the Future]].\\" I suppose \\"[[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time]]\\" is more in the ballpark as a cinematic reference point, but there is obviously a big difference in the method of time traveling between the two films (duh).  But that film would be the prime example of how a love story can overcome the limitations of realistic time travel.  I would not say that the payoff for \\"Deja Vu\\" is great, but it is pretty good given the specifics of the situation that it has set up.  Let me put it this way: when the credits started to roll I was not thinking, \\"What the hell is wrong with these people?\\"<br /><br />I was almost going to round up on this film despite the fact that I was willing to bury it early on because I really like Claire's involvement in the end game and the way the characters keep the focus on what is really important here.  Obviously, this is a film that you want to watch twice, so that you can better appreciate how all of the myriad payoffs are set up earlier in the film.  Final Note: In addition to deleted scenes and extended scenes, the main extra on the DVD is the Surveillance Track, which has Scott, Marsill, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer providing commentary during a \\"seamless behind the scenes experience\\" that cuts away from the film and back again to provide interviews and featurettes.

1400097029|4.0|John Banville's novel, The Sea, is certainly a work of literary art, with intricate sentence structure, vast poetic language, and lyric cadence, so that the story comes forward in waves of memory, from a vast sealike unconscious that brews and is not at rest.  I have total admiration for Banville's mastery of the English language. The book is darkly poetic along a braided narrative of present reflections, recent events of loss and pain, and fragments of earlier memories pulled from memory. <br /> <br />Max, a fellow that you never really comprehend or grasp, almost like a smokey or ghostly narrator, comes to a boarding house to relax in isolation after the death of his wife Anne. Yet he returns to the boarding house which had formerly been occupied by two childhood friends who drowned themselves to spite their parents.   <br /> <br />This is the story of remembering loss and re-weaving those memories before sending them off to the vast sea of memory and unconscious. Max has multiple loses. His father leaves him and his mother in poverty, never to be seen again. Max encounters his first loves with the Grace family, where as a pre-adolsecent he first falls into infatuation with Mrs. Grace and then with her 10 year old daughter, Chloe.  <br /> <br />Max returns to the seaside scene of these painful events to recovery from Anna's recent death. Why would someone do this? I suspect because we never really heal from great loss, we recover gradually and the process of forgetting helps the raw wound of grief heal into scar tissue. But when new grief is encountered, it must be integrated into the fragmented cloth of memory and woven into the patterns of previous lose and memory. Thus this novel is highly reflective rather than propelled by action of the characters in some form of conflict. <br /> <br />The ability of Banville to shift between his childhood, his marriage, and the present is superb and flawless. It never feels awkward because he recognizes that memory allows usto shift scene so long as we understand the thread of imagery that unites the various times and places and memories. The use of poetic narrative further evokes the memory and its parallel emerging unconscious processes. <br /> <br />The Sea is often a universal symbol of memory and unconscious. Here that image is used well as memories emerge and sink from Max's vast unconscious sea.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed for me is the band's first genuine classic album. It was the album that lived up to their billing as the greatest rock and roll band on earth in the late sixties. <br /> <br />By this time the Stones had released the great Beggars Banquet album, which is a great album, albeit not a classic but a pivotal record in the band's career, where country rock was added to their usual rock/blues and a few classic rock singles such as \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Honkey Tonk Woman\\".  <br /> <br />Let It Bleed kicks off with one of my favourite Stones songs, the harrowing classic \\"Gimme Shelter\\". There could not have been a better song to have opened this album. \\"Love in Vain\\" changes the tempo a bit with Mick crooning the blues cover accompanied by Keith's acoustic guitar and Mick Jones slide work is nice. It's a good effort but never came near the original. A little humour is added with \\"Country Tonk\\" which is a parody of their single, Honkey Tonk Woman.  <br /> <br />The album comes alive in a big way with the thumping bass line into of \\"Live With Me\\", which is good times Stone's rock. I love the way Keith joins Mick with harmonising vocals. Great song. The title track comes off better live in my opinion. There are some great Stones lines in it such as the coke and sympathy one amongst others. <br /> <br />Mick turns in a sensational effort with one of their best blues originals, \\"Midnight Rambler\\". The song remains a concert staple after all these years. Keith's song, \\"You Got The Silver\\" is a good little country blues ballad. \\"Monkey Man\\" didn't have quite the popularity as \\"Midnight Rambler\\" \\"Gimme Shelter\\" or \\"You Cant Always Get What You Want\\" but is every bit as good as any of those.  <br /> <br />The album closes with the epic \\"You Cant Always Get What You Want\\" which is the Stone's \\"Hey Jude\\". Addition of the horn was fantastic but the choir is a little overbearing towards its closure. Underneath its epicness lies perhaps one of the best songs from the Jagger/Richards team. <br /> <br />This is an essential rock album which I recommend to everyone. There was a second classic Stones album, that was Sticky Fingers. Beggars and Exile have been touted as classics over the years but just don't measure up to Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers.   <br /> <br />

Weak to missing.  And when 99% of the characters look alike, character development is essential.<br /><br />Genre and tone?  Well, it's sort of musical, sort of a drama, sort of a comedy, sort of an adventure, but not enough of anything to be satisfying.  There's no \\"root for the hero, curse the villain\\" in this movie. I came away feeling \\"who cares?\\"<br /><br />I expected a romp.  What I got was a drag.<br /><br />Two stars -- I'd have given it only one had it not been for the amazing animation.
B00005JKES|5.0|\\"Twin Peaks\\" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, hilariously written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.<br /><br />And though it's only eight episodes, the first season of David Lynch and Mark Frost's \\"Twin Peaks\\" is a brilliant piece of television, with a dozen subplots all somehow linked to the mysterious death of the beautiful, troubled Laura Palmer. Brilliant writing, quirky acting, and great cherry pie are all mixed up in the darkly eerie season.<br /><br />For the record, it doesn't contain the pilot episode, where Laura is found \\"wrapped in plastic,\\" and Special Agent Dale Cooper(Kyle McLachlan) is called in to investigate. Nope, the first season starts with the episode after that: Cooper continues to enjoy the comforts of the hotel, while continuing the investigation -- and getting some surprising results from the autopsy.<br /><br />What's more, the question of who killed Laura is getting more complex, due to a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.<br /><br />While Cooper tries to sort out his evidence and dreams, he finds that Twin Peaks is not the small-town idyll he thought it was, and Laura Cooper was enmeshed in its darkness. There are secret love affairs, town crazies, drug smuggling, corporate devilry about a mill, and an evil presence that lurks in the woods nearby...<br /><br />\\"Twin Peaks\\" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane. It starts off as a basic murder mystery that allows us to the see the underbelly of rural America. But starting in the second episode, it becomes something much, much more.<br /><br />Lynch loads the storyline down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\"). But he and Frost also spun up some wonderfully quirky scenarios, such as Cooper throwing stones to determine who killed Laura, or his famous dream of a dancing midget and a strange Laura double, both talking in a weird \\"backwards\\" manner.<br /><br />And the dialogue has that brilliace that most series cannot keep going for long (\\"Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator\\"). Considering how strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (\\"Black as midnight on a moonless night....\\" \\"Pretty black\\").<br /><br />And the characters are VERY strange. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a \\"damn fine cup of coffee.\\" He's not your average hard-nosed FBI agent.<br /><br />And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, obnoxious FBI agents. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.<br /><br />Quirky and surreal TV is currently in vogue, but they all stem from the little town of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" and the first season is an entrancing experience.s (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\").

B000L212HC|5.0|Overall the movie is great. Story is orginal and creative and keeps you thinking and wondering. Some blu-ray movies i've seen.. mostly the older ones.. had a hard time in dark scenes. This movie however, had everything crisp and clear from beginning to end. No noticeable grains at all.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Fascinating historically, but tedious as far as entertainment goes. I gave it only 2 stars because it had so much wasted potential. With all the wonderful talent and initial intrigue, you wonder why halfway through the movie you wish it would end.
B00000JHAU|5.0|So do you want talk of the music first or do you want The Theory?    Music? Okay.    It starts innocently enough, quietly enough. 'The Stars Of Track And Field' building softly to its confident acoustic climax - hints of pop purity amidst its (meaningful) meandering. There is nothing obvious about this but its beauty is - like all this - just that.    'Seeing Other People' is more immediate and kind of sums up why I love this album, this band. Lyrically it's very clever, about growing up (\\"We lay on the bed there/Kissing just for practice/Could we please be objective?/Cause the other boys are queueing up behind us...\\") and the stories we tell ourselves (\\"A hand over my mouth/A hand over the window/Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle/Then we should be okay and won't get in a muddle/Cause we're seeing other people/At least that's what we say we are doing...\\")but I love this bittersweet gender blurring and then it's just plain funny (\\"You're going to have to change/Or you're going to have to go with girls/You might be better off/At least they know what they are doing...\\" - I love that pay-off line). There's nothing flash about the song though and musically it just draws you in. Before you know it you're hooked.    Candidates for best song on the album flow thick and fast.    'Like Dylan In The Movies' not only has a great title but just rolls along beautifully, so sure of itself, so sure of all of this. This was the first song I really adored on this album but now it's joined by 'The Fox In The Snow' (the repeated refrain of \\"What do they know anyway?/You read it in a book...\\" just gives me goosebumps)and the music merges with those great lyrics to form this mystical whole. I'm either sat there with tears in my eyes or this massive grin on my face.    It's joined by the self-deprecating glory of 'Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying' (\\"You could either be successful or you could be us...\\") and that is then joined by the Nick Drake of 'Mayflower' with its opening \\"Lovesick on a sunny afternoon...\\" which kind of nails the mood of much of this (\\"He had the moves to save the day/But you would love him anyway...\\"), a kind of celebration of the day to day, of the days as they go past with all the reasons how or why they change us, elate us or just leave us as we think we are.    The best is saved till last though. 'The Boy Done Wrong Again' and 'Judy And The Dream Of Horses' combine to round off this marvellous album in truly dreamy fashion. 'The Boy Done Wrong Again' sounds like a dream itself as it hypnotises (\\"All that I wanted was to sing the saddest song/And if you would sing along, I will be happy now...\\") and then the upbeat finale. \\"Judy wrote the saddest song...\\" is how it begins - see how everything just fits, how theme leads to theme and all moves to where you are or where you should be or where you want to be. \\"You dream of horses\\" is how it ends. In between you have pop perfection.    And then it's over. all too soon. So you have to stop and play it all again. Everything drifting...    And the theory? Sorry, The Theory? Oh,it's something and nothing. Well, compared to the music. Just something about how Belle & Sebastian almost singlehandedly saved indie (as in independent) music at a time when the greatness of Nirvana had inadvertantly ruined it, having ushered in an era where every indie band was being signed by the majors and then spat out after an album when the expected 'units' weren't 'shifted'. Creativity stifled and any idea of independent thought gone, just little things like a band being allowed to develop...whatever. Belle & Sebastian changed all that. A wilful independence, a refusal to acknowledge the game let alone play it...and then the change. Indie. Independent.    But then, come on, you can save your theory, all theories. Nothing much matters next to the majesty of this music. Play it again and play it louder each time. Yes.
B000687M48|4.0|I don't know if all the copies of this CD are like this, but the one I have is messed up. The booklet is labeled all wrong (i.e., My Immortal is labeled as 'Breathe No More') and Whisper is listed as the last song. I was so confused, because it had been a while since I listened to Fallen (plus I lost it) so I didn't remember which songs were titled incorrectly.<br /><br />But, other than that, I love this Cd. I just had to print out a new booklet.
B000MQ54OY|4.0|The 1st time i saw happy feet in the theatre.. i wasn't too impressed. The whole animated movie overall, was good.. almost great. Then i watched it on Blu-ray and it was another experience for me. Maybe the great quality of Blu-ray made it more of a eye candy film for me... but... the more i watch it the more i started to enjoy and appreciate the storyline.  <br /> <br />It's a good CGI flick.. the movie is just so great in Blu-ray... highly recommended.
0804115613|5.0|Evelyn Couch is having a midlife crisis.  She was brought up to be a \\"good girl\\" and do everything she was \\"supposed\\" to do, which was to marry a good man and become a wife and mother.  She did, but now that her children are grown and out of the house, Evelyn is feeling that life has passed her by.  She is realizing that the current world is so very different from the one she grew up in and she does not know how to cope.  On top of that, she realizes that her relationship with her husband is drifting farther and farther apart.  Many days, she sits at home alone, overeating and wishing for the courage to end her life. <br /> <br />Things begin to change when she meets Cleo Threadgood, a resident at a local Alabama nursing home.  Cleo regales Evelyn with stories of her family and friends, growing up in a small town named Whistle Stop, Alabama.  Through these stories and numerous visits with Cleo, Evelyn begins to reevaluate her life and discover for the first time, the kind of woman that she wants to become. <br /> <br />This is my favorite book.  I suppose it resonated so well with me because I read it for the first time when I was in college, trying to figure out who I was, much like Ruth.  There are strong themes of hope, resilience, perseverance, and change, in this story.  I never get tired of reading this book because the author writes with such passion and poignancy that it draws me in every time.  As stated earlier, these characters feel like friends who I want to visit over and over. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004VY07|5.0|The plot of the story is simple, a group of upper class men play a game of inviting \\"idiots\\" to dinner and the person who brought the biggest idiot wins.  Nice huh?  Now you might not think this movie is a comedy but it is and a pretty funny one too.  I didn't think I would like it but it make me chuckle.  The main character finds an \\"idiot\\" taxman and invites him over for a drink before the \\"dinner game\\" but an earlier back injury acts up and gets stuck with the idiot in his home.  As we watch the karma payback unfold, the results are hugely entertaining.  A classic comedy that stands up to repeated viewings.  The actors comedic timing are perfect and the script witty.  You can't help but like this lighthearted film.
0345441184|3.0|In this novel, Bradley uses as her story the \\"Matter of Britain\\"; basically, the King Arthur story. However, somewhat less usually, she shows it from the perspectives of the female players: Morgause, Morgaine, Viviane, Nimue, and Guinevere (spelled Gwenhwyfar). The story contains within it the entire King Arthur sequence, from the meeting of Uther Pendragon and Igraine, to the death of Arthur and his taking into Avalon. <br /> <br />There is one of the main problems. This book is just too big. I'm not against long books in general (one of my favorite novels is George R.R. Martin's enormous Storm of Swords), but The Mists of Avalon goes on for so long that it starts to drag, and, more troubling, become repetitive. It simply felt, to me, like there was just not enough subject matter to adequately fill in the pages of this book, and so the story seems to simply drift along at times, with the only indication of progression being the years as the story drifts toward the end that we must know will happen in the Arthurian Saga (Arthur's fatal wounding at the hands of Mordred). <br /> <br />The dialogue and prose is another weakness. Frequently, the characters (particularly when it is a prominent male character speaking to a prominent female character) sound more like they are giving declarative speeches than really engaging in talk, including the over-use of exclamation points. Certain bits of dialogue, particularly the banter between the Christian priests of various colors and the ladies of Avalon, is repeated over and over again. Bradley can also be a bit wordy in her descriptions; some of the Pagan ceremonies felt like they could be described in much briefer terms. <br /> <br />At the same time, though, the characters of this story are interesting. Gwenhwyfar is clearly a religious fanatic, and while it is somewhat simplistic that Arthur would dump a powerful oath simply to please her, her character is nonetheless a good portrayal of that mindset, along with her almostself-hating personality. Morgraine is interesting, too, particularly in the sense that for all her good traits, we get the sense of a deep personal flaw that keeps rebounding to wound her over and over again, in her torrid, dangerous affair with Accolon and attraction to Lancelet.  <br /> <br />I'm more mixed in attitude about the religious conflict in this story (Pagan vs Christian). In particular, the Pagan portrayal varies a lot in quality. Some images, like the Running with the King Stag on Dragon Island, were very well done (if a bit wordy). At the same time, it leaves you wondering, \\"If these Druids and Priestesses of Avalon had access to powerful magic, and powerful influence on the leading class, why are they losing?\\" Clearly, the priests aren't personally dangerous to them, and the majority of the people, although nominally Christian (which doesn't include the small dark people and the Tribes), still celebrate the Pagan rites. Keep in mind that I'm personally not a Christian, so I have no emotional stakes in this question. <br /> <br />It's almost kind of an interesting tie-in to current issues with religious fundamentalists. It makes you question, were the Druids and Merlin in this story right to tolerate the Christians who sought to destroy that climate of tolerance? Did they have any choice? Why did Vivian and her ilk fail to keep Britain Pagan - was it simply the effect of the Christian Romans? The book leaves an interesting number of thought questions in its wake. <br /> <br />Overall, I give this book three stars. It has interesting subject matter and characters, but is just weakly described and executed. I would recommend it to any readers interested in an unusual re-telling of the Arthurian legend, with a great degree of patience. <br /> <br />
B000003BDY|5.0|Great from start to finish. Really revealing their brilliant, young talent.<br /><br />The instrumental 2120 South Michigan Avenue is terrific.

B000KX0IOK|4.0|Two knockout performances dominate this uncompromising and emotionally visceral indie. Directed and co-written by first-time feature director Ryan Fleck, this 2006 drama pulls no punches and offers no cheap sentiment in the story of two people intractably bonded by their mutually desultory existences - Dan Dunne, a crack-addicted Brooklyn middle school history teacher, and Drey, a 13-year old student in his class burdened by an overworked mother, a brother in prison, and an insinuating drug dealer named Frank. Fleck and co-writer Anna Boden establish Dan's gifts as a teacher almost immediately as the character engages his class with natural ease. It becomes clear that this is not going to be a fish-out-of-water story but a more complex study of a man caught between his passion for teaching and his hopeless need for the next fix.<br /><br />Dan's self-defeating effort to separate the duality in his life is what provides the impetus of the plot, as there are no simple explanations offered for his drug-addled life until we catch a glimpse of his emotionally disconnected family later on. Much like what Vera Farmiga achieved in [[ASIN:B000I0QL7I Down to the Bone]], Ryan Gosling dissects his character with textured precision and conviction. He honestly earns our attention and even our compassion despite the selfishness Dan displays at times. Matching Gosling all the way is novice Shareeka Epps, who plays Drey with almost unnerving steadiness. She affectingly conveys the self-protective insulation her character has against a world too ready to use her.<br /><br />Together Gosling and Epps remarkably achieve an unexpected symbiosis that makes Dan's and Drey's ongoing struggles palpable. The supporting cast is uniformly strong with effective turns by Anthony Mackie, who shows surprising depth in what could have been a stock villain role as Frank, and by Karen Chilton etching the regret and exhaustion in Drey's mother in just a few brief scenes. Even though the film was done on a miniscule budget, it doesn't feel cheap with particularly strong work found in Andrij Parekh's intentionally bleached-out cinematography. The 2007 DVD offers a nice, unassuming commentary track by Fleck and Boden, but the rest of the extras are not very interesting - a gag reel, three understandably deleted scenes and four extended scenes that really don't add much more insight. However, the film itself is exceptional work.udget, it doesn't feel cheap with particularly strong work found in Andrij Parekh's intentionally bleached-out cinematography.

055358202X|1.0|There are a lot of varieties of speculative fiction. Science fiction assumes the known laws of science are in effect and then projects what if. Fantasy usually assumes that something we know to be true or false is otherwise. Historical fiction uses real events and creates characters that probably didn't exist, or creates reports of situations that may or may not have occurred. And here is a book that assumes an historical world that never existed and reports the goings on without ever breaking the laws of science.<br /><br />It involves a world of medieval history that never existed and recounts the doings of various queens, knights and royalty in their political and personal struggles for power in great detail. For example, one of the main characters is the widowed queen of a former king, who is the regent for her son, and who struggles to keep power for herself in a series of intrigues.<br /><br />The book is one of a continuing series by the author, and I suppose those who have read the prior books will enjoy following the adventures of the characters. However, as a stand-alone book, I found it quite confusing and ultimately, unsatisfying. Most of the confusion is created by the fact that it is impossible to figure out what has occurred before this volume that created the existing events, although by the end of one thousand pages, it's almost possible to piece together enough of what probably happened in prior books so that if you read this volume a second time, you might understand what was going on.<br /><br />The author seems to have aimed his novel at readers who delight in collecting and remembering arcania from the prior novels, by frequently making incomplete reference to people and events that must have occurred in the prior books. For me it was just so many names and confusing events. There is an appendix with endless lists of names of related individuals, but I don't find pleasure in a book that requires me to memorize a thousand names to follow the characters, particularly since many of them seem to have two or three appellations as well.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the book had no denouement. It simply concluded in mid-adventure! Moreover, the separate threads dealing with the dozen or so principal characters followed, each with his or her own chapters, never seemed to come together.<br /><br />I was also put off by the fact that most of these characters seemed to have few if any redeeming social values. The queen mentioned above is selfish, grasping, ruthless and stupid. Every character is striving to harm every other character. The only person who might be worthwhile, a female who might be a knight, were it not for her sex, seems to wander around aimlessly through the countryside, and never moves toward resolving her quest.<br /><br />I suppose that if you have been following this series, you may want to read this book.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Personally, I think this movie is amazing. I was an avid fan before it came out, and waited impatiently after the movie's release date was pushed back and back. Then, saw it in theaters several times. Each time was amazing... The audible gasps and laughs of members in the audience was great. I laughed, I cried, I became a fan all over again. :)  Watch it. Watch the series. Watch the documentary about it. It's all great.<br /><br />I have the wide screen and full screen editions of this movie, which I lend out to potential converts. Even bought another copy today, for my sister. I can't wait for the special edition to come out!<br /><br />Joss Whedon is amazing.<br /><br />The cast of Serenity and Firefly are amazing.<br /><br />Everything about it all is phenomenal. You can relate to just about every character.

B000O178BY|5.0|I was reading up on Year Zero before its actual release date and I was intrigued by this new album that was to be a concept album and not another album that might sound the same as WITH TEETH or THE FRAGILE (which are both good albums).  Year Zero was going to be a concept album about the end of the world, government corruption trying to control everybody, etcetera.  When actually listening to the lyrics mixed in with the electronic sounds and noise it became to be a very nice and refreshing listen (by refreshing I mean Reznor creating a different sound from his last all-rock album).  It was refreshing to hear Reznor do a different style with his music and lyrics and not hearing the usual songs where he talks about problems and issues among his own realm and others close by.  I agree with the another review I read here that this is an album that makes a mark upon all the halo releases and having the complete halo collection to date, Year Zero is one of my favorites (song favorites: Survivalism, My Violent Heart, Capital G, God Given, The Great Destroyer, & In This Twilight).  I would also suggest getting your hands on the 4-track SURVIVALISM CD-Single as well (director's cut video is excellent).  I can't wait to hear Pt. 2 since Year Zero is Pt. 1 of what he is into with this project.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I wasn't surprised when Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar for this film, nor was I surprised when she actually won the Oscar. Her performance was clearly (from the previews) Oscar bait, but what did surprise me was the film gaining an Oscar nod for Best Picture. Even though it had a future Oscar winning performance, was directed by Stephen Frears (who directed one of my favorite films \\"Dangerous Liaisons), it didn't seem like it would be that good. Having now watched it, I still hold to the fact that it is not that good. The film has its merits and deserved its nomination for Best Original Screenplay, but Best Picture is stretching it quite a bit. I feel that \\"Notes on a Scandal\\" should've got the Oscar nomination spot that this film took. Anyway, Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth with Michael Sheen playing the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not long after The Queen accepts Blair as Prime Minister, Diana Spencer the former Princess of Wales dies in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. The world, not just Britain, are shocked by the news of Diana's death and is even more shocked when The Queen and her staff virtually refuse to even acknowledge the death. As her popularity suddenly drops and The Queen struggles to rule her monarchy with dignity, Blair all but takes her place as the main character...Even giving Diana the nickname \\"the people's princess.\\" Judging by the synopsis, it seems that the movie is an attack on The Queen...And for the first half of the movie, I was thinking that it was. It's not. It's a depiction of how The Queen struggled to rise above her own values and still please her people. I doubt this movie would have been as successful as it was, had it not been for Mirren because she's really the person that carries the film. In a movie that is filled with great performances, including from James Cromwell, Michael Sheen also turns in a winning performance. I'm surprised he wasn't able to score an Oscar nomination. \\"The Queen\\" is not a bad film, but I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the top 10 best films of 2006. It is, however, a short and worth watching film with a terrific performance from its leading lady. <br /> <br />GRADE: B-
0618680004|5.0|(My english is not that good but...) NO GOD FROM ANY RELIGION EXISTS. God is a human creation. Primitive men were ignorant abour all natural phenomena so they created the gods (the god of thunder, the god of rain, the god of wind, and so on). Now, thanks to science, we now know these are no gods but just natural phenomena, so god is really just our ignorance, that is that all that we don't know or understand we call it god. Now we don't know where the universe comes from so we say is god, the easy answer to a very difficult problem. <br /> <br />For god it would be very easy to appear on television and once and for all demonstrate his existance and tell us what he wants, but have you ever ask yourself why god does not appear on tv? Well, that's for a very simple reason, because: GOD DOES NOT EXISTS. Theologians will create a bunch of reasons and formulas to explain why god does not appears on tv and to prove its existance but is just a bunch of words to tangle and confuse your mind to continue the lies. <br /> <br />So god, the knowing all, the almighty, the creator of everything, sent HIS ONLY CHILD, Jesus, to the earth, to hide him in a settlement camp, to live in poverty, to be heard by very few who took him for madman, to leave no writings (because everything is written by others) and finally to be tortured and killed by his own creation (the human beings), ISNT THIS JUST HILARIOUS!!! <br /> <br />Also, the human consciousness is a product of all the Physical, chemical and biological processess that ocur in the brain.That's why physical things like drugs, alcohol, or car accidents can affect our \\"soul\\" or consciousness. But there is no heaven (the five star all-included hotel with rainbows in technicolor) and when we die we go nowhere. <br /> <br />So, religions are very dangerous because they are false from beginning to end. So when you start with false premises (the existence of god and the immortality of the soul) you can end up with all kinds of crazy ideaslike suicide bombers.  <br /> <br />So science and rationality is everything, and we need to fight charlatans on every field from politics to new age mumbo jumbo (don't loose your money to this people please!); we need to be informed, read, learn, think and criticize to help create a better world. <br />
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Having recently read the book \\"A Good Year\\" by Peter Mayle, I was eager to see the film version. The book was fantastic, a breezy novel that was sort of a literary breath of fresh air. It was funny, had likeable characters, and was just an all around fun book. Its movie version has its moments of charm and is mildly funny, but it should've stuck to the plotline the book followed and not deleted several key plot points. Russell Crowe plays Max Skinner; a ruthless, English businessman who nearly loses his job on the same day he finds out his beloved Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) has died. Being Henry's only next of kind, Max has inherited Henry's home and adjacent vineyard. Needing a vacation, Max heads back there and soon begins reliving all his great memories there while simultaneously trying to figure out how to sell the place much to the dismay of the outspoken Francis Duflot (Didier Bourdon), the man who takes care of the vines. On the eve of selling it, an American woman named Christie (Abbie Cornish, the talented actress from the film \\"Candy\\") shows up at the house claiming to be Henry's daughter...A daughter that Henry never met, leaving Max in a possible legal battle for the house. Living under the same roof with Christie, Max also finds love with a French woman named Fanny (Marion Cotillard) while Max's best friend Charlie (Tom Hollander) begins falling for Christie. Anyway, in the thank you section of the book Mayle thanks Ridley Scott for helping him come up with the idea for the story. Naturally, Scott had to direct the film version. Why he read the adaptation and chose to use it is a mystery. The movie version is likeable, but nowhere near as good as the book was. I mean, this movie is the epitome of where people go wrong adapting novels. Characters have been changed, the plot has been changed; some characters are incredibly one-dimensional, etc. Crowe works perfectly as Skinner, although Skinner's character is quite different from the one you encounter inthe book. Having already impressed me for her brave performance in \\"Candy,\\" Cornish also shows how charming she can be. \\"A Good Year\\" reminded me of two other films...\\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" and \\"Sideways.\\" The former because it has a foreigner in a different country (in that case, an American in Italy) and the latter because it has to do with wine. Both films were much better than \\"A Good Year.\\" I haven't read much into what other people think about the film, but you must realize while reading this that I didn't quite walk into the movie with an open mind. Maybe, big maybe, if you haven't read the book you'll enjoy the film. The book is much better, but the film version is not a complete waste of time. <br />BOTTOM LINE: Read the book! <br />GRADE: C+
0393327655|5.0|(My english is not that good but...) NO GOD FROM ANY RELIGION EXISTS. God is a human creation. Primitive men were ignorant abour all natural phenomena so they created the gods (the god of thunder, the god of rain, the god of wind, and so on). Now, thanks to science, we now know these are no gods but just natural phenomena, so god is really just our ignorance, that is that all that we don't know or understand we call it god. Now we don't know where the universe comes from so we say is god, the easy answer to a very difficult problem. <br /> <br />For god it would be very easy to appear on television and once and for all demonstrate his existance and tell us what he wants, but have you ever ask yourself why god does not appear on tv? Well, that's for a very simple reason, because: GOD DOES NOT EXISTS. Theologians will create a bunch of reasons and formulas to explain why god does not appears on tv and to prove its existance but is just a bunch of words to tangle and confuse your mind to continue the lies. <br /> <br />So god, the knowing all, the almighty, the creator of everything, sent HIS ONLY CHILD, Jesus, to the earth, to hide him in a settlement camp, to live in poverty, to be heard by very few who took him for madman, to leave no writings (because everything is written by others) and finally to be tortured and killed by his own creation (the human beings), ISNT THIS JUST HILARIOUS!!! <br /> <br />Also, the human consciousness is a product of all the Physical, chemical and biological processess that ocur in the brain.That's why physical things like drugs, alcohol, or car accidents can affect our \\"soul\\" or consciousness. But there is no heaven (the five star all-included hotel with rainbows in technicolor) and when we die we go nowhere. <br /> <br />So, religions are very dangerous because they are false from beginning to end. So when you start with false premises (the existence of god and the immortality of the soul) you can end up with all kinds of crazy ideaslike suicide bombers.  <br /> <br />So science and rationality is everything, and we need to fight charlatans on every field from politics to new age mumbo jumbo (don't loose your money to this people please!); we need to be informed, read, learn, think and criticize to help create a better world. <br />
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I've spent my whole life listening to this guy, and he never dissapoints. <br />Friends, times and places come and go, Neil never fails to deliver. God bless <br />Canada for sharing Neil with us all these years.  I first was made aware of Prarie Wind by watching the DVD of the Nashville concert with Emmylou. It <br />was spectacular by the way and I had to have the CD.  It's the easiest five stars I've ever given out. The songs rattle around in my brain along with Neil's signature hardscrabble guitar riffs. There's not a bad song to be found on here. Prarie Wind (Blowing Through My Head) just makes me shake my head and wonder how Neil does it.  No Wonder and Falling Off The Face Of <br />the Earth are outstanding.
B000O178BY|5.0|Each time I buy a NIN album I need to listen to it many, many times before it sinks in.  Most times it's like I know the music is catchy, but I need time to digest the lyrics.   <br /> <br />So I've digested the lyrics and I believe that this is the most politically conscious album of NIN.  Thank you Trent.  More artists need to attack the status quo the way this album does.  Some may think it's talking about the future, but I think it's talking about the present.  Musically and lyrically this album has combined the elements of prior NIN material and culminated it into a timeless masterpiece.
B000007489|5.0|I bought this record (LP) in 1986 after hearing Institutionalized.  I recorded that song onto cassette tape, listened to the record, and was so shocked (imagine--at age 16?  What a p**sy) with some of the content I smashed the record outside on the sidewalk.  Cut to some 19 years later, I see a re-issue colored-vinyl LP at Newbury Comics and decide I must have this, I must re-claim and face that which drove me to violently destroy a violent album full of rage.  The result?    This record is sick, and it's the best sick I've ever heard.  Classic, classic, classic.  A must-own as a record of pure insanity.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After years of tolerating Pierce Brosnan's wimpy and slight fey interpretation of Ian Fleming's creation,it is gratifying to watch the most masculine Bond since Connery. <br /> <br />From the opening sequence where we see Bond get his oo status in a swiftly violent fight scene where he records his first kill, the audience knows this latest installment is a different beast from its predcessors. <br /> <br />Gone is the reliance on gadgets and cheesy oneliners in its place is a complicated more three dimensional Bond who bleeds when he takes a hit by both his enemies and the woman who wins his heart.  <br /> <br />An intelligent and thoughful portrayal by Craig has made this classic film hero relevant once more.
0618680004|2.0|Dawkins claims that Theism violates the Occam's razor test.  This has a counter example.  Computer scientists are now capable of creating computer simulations of physical laws, self-replication, and evolving organisms. These simulations are virtual universes within our universe, they are in full view of empirical scientific evidence, and they all have creators. Why should we assume that our own universe is different?  Why propose a new type of universe without a creator in the face of no empirical support when all universes that we can fully study have creators?  This view indicates that it is Atheism that violates the heuristic test of Ockham's razor. I think Zanzeros has a more consistent world-view than Dawkins.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Everything is Illuminated is an art film, but it is not one in the typical way. It has a story, it has humor, and it has heart, but it never becomes pretentious. The film follows Jonathan (Elijah Wood), a \\"collector\\" of memories. He is attempting to retrace his grandfather's life and learn about the woman that saved him from WWII. He journeys to the Ukrane where his tour guides consist of a hip-hop obsessed translator Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his eccentric grandfather (Boris Leskin). They rib him for being afraid of their dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and for being a vegetarian. They want to know why he wants to learn about his grandfather. Along the way, however, his strangeness becomes comfortable and everyone realizes they have much more in common than initially realized. <br /> <br />The comedy is intellectual, just like in Little Miss Sunshine. It isn't blatantly, but gentle and easy to miss. The story can be a bit confusing and aimless, but that gives the viewer room to make his own conclusions. Films like this are often overlooked, just as this one was never very famous. That does not detract from it's quality. It is an enjoyable, thought-provoking film with a great cast.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have to say that personally I thought he was one of the best James Bond's to date.  Thrilling and exciting, a defiantly must see movie!  The only real problem that I had with the movie as a whole was the fact that this movie was supposed to be the beginning of James Bond's career; in all of the other movies he did not have text messaging technology.  I know the times are changing but this is set before the other ones and he started off being more advanced that he was later on!
B00005JPLU|4.0|Once again Frank Millers graphic novels are brought to the big screen and once again the product was very enjoyable. The production values of the film are top notch, the direction solid and the visuals a feast for your eyes. There is an exceptionally large amount of cgi shots in this film, which normally dosen't really tickle my fancy, but in this case it actually helps giving the film a comicbook feeling, that cannot be achieved through other means. Also the use of slow motion to almost freeze frame during the massive (and frequent) fight scenes, helped to get that \\"comic\\" feeling. It's like looking at a single frame in a graphic novel. The result is in effect very similar to that of \\"Sin City\\", which also had the feeling of being a \\"moving comicbook\\", if you get my meaning. Very good.     The cast also performs well. I especially enjoyed Gerard Butler as King Leonid. He reminded me of Sean Connery (which is about as nice a thing that I can think of saying about any actor). He has the same accent, the same funny way with s's, the same understated comedic delivery of insults to his opponents and he displays a great physique.     Historically inaccurate as it may be, it is still a very entertaining film. And then again, who takes their history lessons from the cinema?  The storyline is simple and dosen't wander, yet it is still very compelling and it grips you very effectively. The story is really more about ideals which are common to us all and which we all wish to posses. It is about honour, glory, valour, righteousness and doing what you think is right. Highly recommendable.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Great tale of a Roman general, Maximus, who under dire circumstances is forced to become a gladiator.  He antagonizes emperor Commodus and there is a kind of rivalry between the two throughout the whole movie.  It is a heart wrenching tale of one man's struggle to survive against all odds with the only thing keeping him going is his hope for revenge against the one man that destroyed his life.  The historical accuracy of the movie is amazingly good in reference to how the Colosseum was composed and some of the methods of fighting.  Of course as in all other movies everything is dramatized to fit entertainment value but even with that Gladiator is a striking example of ancient Roman construct.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I was a bit suspicious when I first went in to see this particular film. Magic and sleight of hand is not really to my liking, but I decided to go anyway, mostly because of the wonderful cast and director Chris Nolan. I was definitely not disappointed. The cast played wonderfully, Jackman and Bale both did great jobs portraying two obsessed magic rivals. You really get to feel the desperation, anger, defeats and victories as the story progresses. Also Michael Caine did, as always, deliver a good performance. The direction of the film is equally good with mr. Nolan giving it a slightly dark edge, and the production values are top notch. They did a wonderful job recreating a victorian London environment and the film is visualy very interesting and pleasing.  <br /> <br />The story is up to par most of the way, but lacks a bit in the end. There are some hints and clues along the way, which foretells the ending, but I wouldn't say it's obvious what's going to happen. Sadly it's a bit anticlimactic when it finally goes down, and it leaves you with a bit of a bitter taste. That being said, it is still a good film and definitely worth seeing. It is more than just visuals and more than just scifi, it's a good story of rivalry, envy and obsession. Highly recommendable.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|An excellent movie in plot and design.  Each scene was artfully done and the plot development of the characters was wonderfully illustrated.  The movie set in the turn-of-the-century Vienna, is about a magician and his childhood love who he finds in his adulthood.  She is of upper class and not suitable for the likes of him especially when she is to marry the Crown Prince.  Will he be able to make them disappear together forever, or will they live out their lives separated?
1582701709|1.0|I consider myself a really happy and successful person.  I believed in the law of attraction well before buying this book and have practiced it for a few years now.  Good things have generally come to me when I've been at my most positive.  That said, this book is really 184 pages of reiterating that everything you do is based on...you guessed it...the law of attraction.  There's you're executive summary.  What really concerns me, however, is that people who truly believe in \\"The Secret\\" seem to think they are somehow morally superior because if it.  They have this `tone' when they speak to those that don't agree that says, \\"...poor you.  You're just too cynical to be reached.\\"  It's almost pity and I find it somewhat condescending.  I read the book and went along with most of it, but where I really stumble is with the concept that if you're in an unfortunate situation (like a car crash, the towers on 9-11, a random robbery, an earthquake) you have personally done something to will it to happen.  I find that very strange logic.  But maybe that's the point...maybe it's the logic I use that prevents me from being sold on this idea 100%.  The bottom line is that you are the only person who can change things in your life.  You have to get off the couch to lose weight.  You have to stop buying things you can't afford if you want true wealth.  You have to stop complaining about your job and either improve your skill set or look for a better one if you're miserable at work.  It's pretty simple to know what to do.  The hard part is actually doing it.  If you want a really motivational book that makes you more aware of your actions and generally makes you feel warm and fuzzy then this book is for you.  There's nothing wrong with that at all.  But, if you're looking for something deeper with real-world advice and practical application examples, you're going to have to write the sequel.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  There is just no getting around it, the plot is well developed and the twists and turns that happen in the movie are very well done.  I think that the casting was done really well; Sarah Michelle Gellar can play the bitchy attitude very well and Reese Witherspoon has always had that innocent girl next door look about her.  it is most certainly a movie that I think would have the most appeal to teenagers and people in their 20s.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|You can't deny this woman has an incredible voice and is a joy to listen to.  I was very excited for this album, but was very disappointed.  It is a very dark melancholy cd.  The lyrics are a catalyst for political metaphors making the album more of a lecture than a listening pleasure.  If you read the lyrics, make sure you have someone around to cheer you up after.  The only exception on this album is 'Sinking soon'.  The combination of the instrumentals and her voice is fantastic, regardless of the lecturing tone of the lyrics.  Despite that, Sinking Soon is the only reason to purchase this cd.  I look forward to another album of hers but I will not jump into the waters to quickly, I will wait to hear the music and lyrics first to make sure she has created to entertain and not lecture or politicize.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I was extremely pleased with the outcome of this movie.  The screenplay is very well written, incorporating mainly Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into the movie while also adding other various works of Shakespeare's.  The movie has a semi-historical basis to it and portrays vast romantic comedy throughout.  One of my favorite feel good romantic comedies to watch!  Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry on set!
B0001I561E|5.0|The story of Aladdin, from a collection of stories dating back more than a millennium, has been filmed dozens of times in dozens of variations.  However, none was ever filmed as creatively, humorously and family friendly as Disney Studios did in 1992.  The success of the movie owes much to the talents of Robin Williams, whose manic impersonations and characterizations propel this movie along at a frantic pace.  Disney also kept the story of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine simple, helping the appeal of the movie.<br /><br />This story is relatively simple, cutting out much of the detail from the original story.  Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger), is a teenager trying to find enough to eat in Baghdad.  Though Aladdin steals food and is a bit of a rogue, he also has a sense of fairness, honor and innocence, a \\"diamond in the rough\\" that evil Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) needs to enter the Cave of Wonders to steal the magic lamp.<br /><br />Aladdin enters the cave and finds the lamp, but uses the lamp to escape and become Prince Ali in an attempt to win the heart and hand of Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin).  As we learn early in the movie, Princess Jasmine wants nothing to do with phonies and princes; she is looking for someone to whom she can give her heart, someone who will understand and love her.  Prince Ali is not that person.<br /><br />Jafar wants the power of being the Sultan of Baghdad.  His plan is simple, get the lamp, gain absolute power, marry Jasmine, and take over the world; not necessarily in that order.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Jafar's trusty adviser Iago the Parrot, voiced by the always obnoxious and, certainly in the case of this movie, funny Gilbert Gottfried.  Perhaps if Jafar had not had a parrot as an advisor, things might have turned out different for him.<br /><br />The animation in this edition of the movie is marvelous.  The colors are bright and images are quite clear.  This movie is excellent to watch on your big screen television.<br /><br />Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music.  The standout song is \\"A Whole New World,\\" but I also liked \\"Prince Ali\\" and \\"One Jump Ahead.\\"  Alan Menken's score and Tim Rice's music garnered an Oscar for Menken and an Oscar for Menken and Rice.  In fact, this movie won 22 significant awards and was nominated for another 15.<br /><br />Aladdin is a good guy trying to survive in a tough world.  Princess Jasmine is naïve and innocent.  Aladdin's love for Jasmine is pure and teenage and children and teenagers everywhere will identify with Aladdin's angst.  The song and dance routines of the Robin Williams' Genie keep the overall tone of this movie light, which is necessary to help balance the evil of Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman).<br /><br />I recommend this movie for all members of the family except for the very youngest members, who may be frightened by the images of Jafar and the Genie is a couple of the scenes.  Most children ages 4 and above should be able to watch this movie with little difficulty.<br /><br />Enjoy!t to watch on your big screen television. <br /> <br />Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music.

B000NA1OXY|1.0|This is derivative, unoriginal radio/MTV-TRL pop garbage. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do NOT refer to Avril Lavigne as having anything to do with punk; punk ethics or punk music. She is so far removed from even remotely sounding punk and even farther from having any of the DIY, rebellious, and anti-authority ethics that bands like the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Discharge or Black Flag helped established for the underground punk scene of today. Just because she's packaged by some major label to \\"look\\" rebellious by wearing a skull and crossbones or anarchy shirt (what would an anarachist even be doing on a major record label making music for MTV??) and carrying a skateboard does not make her anything. This is teenie-bopper music for 12 year olds. Call it what you want, just don't soil anything punk rock stands for by referring to Avril as being punk--she has never been.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I saw this with my wife in the theaters, thinking it would be to \\"girly\\" for me, but it is actually quite funny. This follows about 7 storylines which are intertwined in one way or another through the christmas season.  The story lines are aged rocker past his prime, the single prime minister, the writer in a foriegn land, the troubled marriage, the widower and stepson, the single young man not living to his potential, and the newlywed best friend.  Well done, decent acting, and not a minute to long or to short (2 hours 15 minutes jam packed).  The bonus scenes on the DVD are nice, but needed to be cut.  Worth owning to watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.

B0002N4U1A|5.0|Wow - My mind reels as I listen to this music. Some elements are cut from the classic jazz of the early-mid 20th century and some are snatched from the conversation you heard at the bar last night. It's this curious and  delicious recipe that delights the musical palate, Her voice doesn't overwhelm on first pass, but it is perfectly what is needed - never more - never less and sits in the mix as an extraordinary instrument among the sonic array. This is a great album, songs like \\"I Heard Love is Blind\\" combine wonderful music and clever storytelling, making an old situation familiar and fresh and amusing. If you enjoy jazz, r&b, and interesting music, check this out. If you're looking for endless arias and scales that shatter glass, it ain't here and it ain't missed. This is some mighty fine music indeed!!
0895260131|5.0|Having served with the U.S. Army in counter-terrorism efforts against Islamic terrorists beginning in the late 1970's, I have studied a lot about Islam. As one can imagine, most books about the religion are written by zealous adherents who either wittingly or unwittingly ignore the blemishes of the Islamic culture while burnishing the more attractive features. This book is a good, readable overview of Islam, its history, and its culture. What makes it so outstanding is that Mr. Spencer writes so objectively about Islam, although from the admitted perspective of a Christian. You learn much more about the true nature of Islam, both good and bad, than most books on the subject are willing or able to reveal. I highly recommend it.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Keeping it short: <br />This album definitely has a bit darker feel to it, and as someone else already commented, the production is noticeably a little cleaner and polished...but I don't feel like it detracts from their overall sound, as it still has that characteristic raw edge. I suppose this sort of thing is really up to you to decide. <br /> <br />The songwriting here, as with the last record, is fantastic. I honestly expected a drop off from \\"Whatever People..\\" largely because that album was so great. I'm glad to report there is no fall off here, and while I wouldn't necessarily place \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" ahead of last year's debut, it undeniably picks up where that album left off. <br />
B000N3ST3Y|3.0|This past year, there have been so many classic bands that have decided to reunite. With the success of acts like The Police and Van Halen coming back this past year, to reunite on tour, it has been a year of classic pop and rock reintroduced to a whole new audience, as well as die hard fans from years ago. That has also been a surprise with Genesis as well. Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks returned to touring as one, without founding member and original lead singer Peter Gabriel. Nevertheless, the feeling of classic rock from them is well-welcomed in favor of people who seem more interested in acts like Beyonce' or Kelly Clarkson. That being said, their classic first U.S. hits album has been re-issued to the public.<br /><br />Turn It On Again: The Hits, Genesis classic 1999 greatest hits album has been re-relased to record buyers. The collection includes 18 tracks that've have reflected the groups longtime 30 year history of highs and lows. The songs have all been restored nicely, as well as it sounded when it was first issued. The collection includes great tracks, but mostly from the era when Phil was the lead singer. The songs include hits like That's All, their #1 smash Invisible Touch, Abacab, Turn It On Again, No Son Of Mine, and Follow You Follow Me. Although the collection sounds great, nothing new has been added to the record. The album still overlooks tracks like No Reply At All, Illegal Alien, Trick Of The Tail, and Man On The Corner.<br /><br />Still, there maybe a few songs that haven't been added but Turn It On Again by Genesis is a really good single disc reflection of their career, but not as close as their 2005 Platinum Collection. Nevertheless, this is a good re-introduction to those who haven't yet heard the invisible touch of what made Genesis sound great. This is why there hasn't been a complete misunderstanding.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: C+<br />Overall: C+
0316010669|5.0|\\"Blink\\" does a fine job of shedding light on the decision making process.  The primary concept of the book is \\"thin slicing\\"--making decisions quickly on a minimum of information.  The author shows when it works and why.  He also shows when it doesn't work and why.  Finally, he shows the reader how to improve on his/her \\"thin slicing\\" ability. <br /> <br />The concept of \\"thin slicing\\" is a great one, and the book is well written and easy to follow.  Several reviewers were critical that the book was overly repetetive.  I felt the author was simply doing a good job of demonstrating and reinforcing his thesis. <br /> <br />After reading this, I think I will pick up a copy of \\"Tipping Point.\\"
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I love this series for several reasons. The spectacular photography is well represented in HD DVD and was the driving force behind my wife letting me buy an HD DVD player (she loves the series, too). Guys, this HD DVD set and a new HD DVD player (or go BluRay if you prefer) make a wonderful Mother's day gift. Amazon sells a nice Toshiba HD DVD player that goes well with this series; it's the one I am using right now as I view sail fish feeding.
0743298020|3.0|As a fan of writers such as Umberto Eco, Mary Renault, John Crowley, Charles Palliser, Iain Pears and John Fowles, I was expecting something literary, intelligent, and engaging in Ms. Setterfield's novel.  On the whole, however, I found that the storyline and \\"mystery\\" hardly held my interest throughout.  In fact, I stopped reading the book for a few days at several points and debated whether I should finish it or not.  The author's style is very self-conscious and the pacing is tedious.  The characters are only vaguely interesting, and the climax (after the \\"merry chase\\") is hardly...well...climactic.   I can think of several other titles that are much better examples of the historical/mystery genre including THE PORTRAIT OF MRS. CHARBUQUE, DARK FIRE, AN UNPARDONABLE CRIME, THE MEANING OF NIGHT, AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST, THE NAME OF THE ROSE, THE QUINCUNX, THE DREAM OF SCIPIO, THE GHOST WRITER and LEMPRIERE'S DICTIONARY.  <br /> <br />If you can get this book for under 10 bucks, it is worth a read, but barely.

630587493X|4.0|Williams plays Andrew, a household robot of the future, who, through a melted circuit, developes his own personality, and questions his reason for being. While the movie was touted as a comedy (there are very funny bits with Oliver Platt acting as his adopted mentor and `parts improver'), it is more poignant than this.<br /><br />This film is a very well done study in humanity. Using a supposed inhuman character as the lead character, we are slapped in the face with a reality that has becaome all too common place in our society - the living in fear with not only the unknown, but living in fear because our government tells us we must. In the future, discrimination between races and beliefs is replaced with humans using androids as their focus of hate and rascism.<br /><br />Andrew the Android (Williams), having become self-aware, learns to hide his uniqueness, in a simple attempt to survive destruction. Not only does he learn to mask his abilities to the public, he is forced to hide his developed emotions, provided through one of Platt's programs. While this makes for a great story, it is a comment on how humans interact in the real world.<br /><br />As he searches for legitamacy, he demands Platt replace his robotic parts with more humanistic features in a desire to be nothing more than to be accepted by humans.<br /><br />Centuries pass in this sad tale. Political stances in our so called modern mores are questioned. And in the end (GOD I HATE to give it away...) Andrew discovers love, how painful it can be, and learns that death is the ultimate definition of life.<br /><br />I recommend this film for those who can stand introspection. If you are looking for a comedy, stop halfway through. The second half will jerk your heart, and hopefully open your eyes to the search that we all live for...the search for what makes us human.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars due to the trailers making this a comedy. I love Robim Williams in his serious roles. He has a gift of drawing us into the characters he plays. One of my favorites is `The Fisher King'.<br /><br />Rent the movie, and be prepared to come to grips with your own feelings about stereotypes.a gift of drawing us into the characters he plays.

B000GYHVFC|4.0|Unbelievable!!!  For those that hasn't experience HD (high def), this movie is an eye opener to what HD can do! When Frances McDormand was talking to Charlize Theron (white robe scene), the color was so beautiful, it just stood out very much.  Now, I'm not saying this is the best movie with story wise, but as for picture, this is a great piece of DEMO to show what HD is like!  This is an awesome movie! Charlize is very cool!  If you are into this HD format era, this is a movie to get, in fact i would even go as far as saying is as close a King Kong in HD.  This movie is a must have, you won't be upset with the purchase with story and picture wise!  Mesmerizing!!
B000LC55F2|3.0|If you want a glowing account of this movie, stop reading now, because I can't give one.  I'd heard a number of negative things about this film from people I work with, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  To start off with, the acting wasn't too great.  Hugh Jackman was fantastic, but Christian Bale was not the right actor to play other main character.  Nothing about Bale says \\"magician\\".  Also, David Bowie as Tesla was another terrible choice.  He has a habit of overacting everything.  This was a case of poor casting.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it was way too easy to figure out the ending.  There were too many very obvious signs that gave everything away.  I'm not the brightest guy, so if I can unravel the \\"secrets\\", then anyone can.<br /><br />Having said all of this, I don't think that the movie was awful.  The special effects were good, and some of the scenes were well put-together.  I do like the fact that there weren't any good guys.  Both Jackman and Bale played characters who were despicable.<br /><br />Don't buy this movie.  Rent it or borrow it from a friend.  And don't make it one of your top choices from Netflix.
0151013047|4.0|It is good storytelling. Has the MH trademark 'futility' element as an undercurrent running throughout the tale. Despite the 3 hours of explanation, there is enough left unsaid so that intentions and reasons maintain sufficient ambiguity giving the conclusion a tragic flavor.
B000MQ4X1Y|4.0|Bad Company-Straight Shooter ****<br /><br />There is not much to say about Bad Company. Nothing really exciting happand to the band and they dont really have any good storys, they were just your average good old rock n' roll band. Straight Shooter was the bands second album. They were still on Swan Song at this point, Led Zeppelins record lebel. While this is not as good as the self titled debut Bad Company this is still a great album.<br /><br />'Good Lovin Gone Bad' opens the album and it is along the same lines as 'Cant Get Enough from the debut musicaly, but lyricly it is the flip side, where this is about love going bad the other is about not getting enough love. A nice way to open the album and Mick Ralphs plays some killer guitar on this track. 'Feel Like Makin Love' is a radio classic. Still to this day is played on the radio regularly. It starts off nice and acousticly and then kicks in to the hard rocking chorus. Easily one of the bands best songs. 'Weep No More' is very dixie. A nice little ditty about still loving a girl after she did you wrong. 'Shooting Star' is a longer song clocking in at over six minutes, and still managed to become a massive radio hit. While this is concidered to be one of the bands best songs, it was never a big hit with me, I can only listen to it so many times. 'Deal With The Preacher' is easily the best song on the album. The lyrics are the best on the album and it is clearly Paul Rogers best vocals performance of the album and probably one of his best ever. 'Wild Fire Woman' is a nice little rocker with a funky back beat and loose bass line which adds a little flavor to the album. The song has a great chorus and some killer vocals from Rogers. 'Anna' is a nice little love song, very cliche to the time of its release in 1975. Not very special other then it has a whole lot of heart and soul in the performance, see because the lyrics are nice but they seem to desperate like a cry for what he is singing about rather then what he really has. 'Call On Me' is the final song on the album. It is heavy in Keyboards and synth. Not very special and actually somewhat tedious, the album would have been stronger without it. Not a very good closer, though the guitar playing is pretty good.<br /><br />Straight Shooter is not the album the debut was but you can not compare the two, that was a legendary album and this wasnt, but it is still good if you dont compare the two. That would be like comparing The Rolling Stones albums Exile On Main Street which is the best album to its follow up Goats Head Soup, while Soup is an amazing album itself if falters in comparison to Exile.

B00005JPPL|4.0|While I've never read the Philip Dick story this movie is based on, I'll have to say this story has some strong points on its own. Nicolas Cage is great as \\"Frank Cadillac\\" or Chris, as he prefers to be called. He can see two minutes into his own future, and this opens some interesting possibilities. It's funny to see him run through several different pick up scenarios before finally finding one that will work with Jessica Biel. This ability also saves his life several times.<br /><br />The storyline moves along at a good pace. While there are some boring scenes, there are enough \\"Wow!\\" moments to keep you hooked until the end.<br /><br />Ah, the end...there's our problem. In an attempt to pull out a great plot twist, we end up with a very cheated feeling. It's almost as if we don't get to see how it all ultimately works out. This could have been fixed with about 5 minutes more screen time, but we don't get it. I'm pretty sure the DVD will probably have an alternate ending in there somewhere because I can't believe this is how they originally envisioned it.<br /><br />As a whole, this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect, and seemed to stumble under the weight of its plot a couple of times (who were the terrorists? where did they get the bomb? Why would a woman like Jessica Biel agree to drive a man she'd just met across the desert...especially when the guy looked like a psycho?), but it was worth the time it takes to watch it.
B000001I0K|5.0|The Cramps-Psychedelic Jungle/Gravest Hits *****<br /><br />The grandparent of psychobily The Cramps have rereleased two of their biggest sellers on one cd. Psychedlic Jungle was one of the bands most popular albums of their career. Gravest Hits was what it sounds like the bands greatest hits but in true psychobily tradition they have to add the dark drama to the title. The bands greatest hits is good for someone who just wants to get to know The Cramps or for someone who is just getting into the band but it does not do the band justice as most of their best songs were not even released as singles so they couldnt have become hits. Psychedelic Jungle while it is a great album it could have been better, it is certainly no Bad Music For Bad People.<br /><br />The Cramps are among a rare breed of bands that are so original and so authentic and good that it is hard not to like them.<br /><br />Sepperatly the two albums are nothing way two special Psychedelic Jungle is three stars at the most and Gravest Hits is easily a four but placed together like this and they quickly become five stars. This is a collection of songs that would help to introduce any new fan of the genre or of the band.

B0001A79JO|4.0|Horropops-Hell Yeah ****<br /><br />The first lady of psychobily and the presedent Patricia and Nekroman released The Horropops first album Hell Yeah! in early 2004 and it is one of the genres best albums of all time. Psychobiliy was made popular by the likes of Reverend Horten Heat and The Cramps in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. True to the rockabiliy fashion of Chey Atkins, early Elvis Presley, and Eddie Cochren and thick in stand up bass and rockabily guitar the Horrorpops mesh that with dark and sometimes haunting lyrics, while not as dark as The Nekromantix still pretty errie at times.<br /><br />Songs like the opener 'Julia' and 'Dotted With Hearts' are slower songs that focus mostly on the voice of Patricia. Other songs like 'Ghouls' 'Kool Flattop' and 'Psychobitches Outta Hell' are more fast paced in your face and unappologetic. 'Girl In A Cage' comes across as almost a ska song at times and a harder rocker at others. A very original song. 'Where They Wander' will undoubtably go down in history as the bands signature song, with a killer chorus that is sure to be stuck in your head after you first listen and full of great background vocals this is easily the best song the band has recorded so far in their career. Other songs like 'Baby Lou Tattoo' and 'Whats Under My Bed' are great songs as well that are very catchy and easy to sing along with. 'Horrorbeach' and 'Miss Take' may be throw aways but thats only two songs out of thirteen.<br /><br />The musicianship is very good here. Patricia is a phenominal bass player, and that its a stand up bass even ups the anti. Nekroman and Karsten are both accomplished guitar players especially Nekroman who also fronts The Nekromantix. Neidermeier is a very solid drummer as well. Psychobily is a very cool genre of rock n' roll that offers something different to the listeners of today. It also transfers you to the 50's when rockabily was popular. The Horrorpops are easily one of the best bands in the genre and this album does a good job of introducing new fans to the music, and while its not as good as their second effort Bring It On this is still a great album that showed promise where there next album took the tourch and ran with it.re and this album does a good job of introducing new fans to the music, and while its not as good as their second effort Bring It On this is still a great album that showed promise where there next album took the tourch and ran with it.
B000O75F7C|5.0|first off, i understand everyone has there own opinion about things but i had to say something. And i normally dont write reviews, so if this seems odd, dont worry about it. <br />anyways, i was reading through the reviews of this album on here, and it seems that the main thing people are complaining about is its different then \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Deadwing\\". (both great albums), and the length of Anesthetize. As for the length of the song, does anyone remember \\"Moonloop\\"? or \\"Voyage 34\\"? (granted it was cut into 4 parts) and \\"Sky Moves Sideways\\"? All great works from PT, and before anyone says they are going back to basics...good. FOABP actaully blends the older style with that of \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Deadwing\\". Or would you people like them to follow the same as the mainstream BS, sounding like the same thing over and over, and not being able to tell them apart from one band  to another. I wouldn't say its their best work to date, i wouldn't say its not their best either. Its PT music. Thats what it is. I got the album, and as with their other releases, i havent stopped listening to it. SW does great things with music, whether its with PT, by himself, Bass Communion, or No-Man. There's a theme to the projects that can only be explained through music. or else you end up with an album of 10-15 songs that are 2 minutes long and have nothing to do with the othere songs, but be on that album. All im saying is. if you want to review an album. dont compare it to other works by the band, every album has its own flare. and thats what makes it great.

B000GY729M|4.0|Wow! Eight months after its release this cd continues to absolutely blow me away. Twelve songs of irresistible non-stop energy, clever changes of pace, forceful yet sensitive vocals, endless hooks and lyrics that beckon the listener to sing along, loudly. This may not be \\"one of the best albums of the past twenty years\\" as Brandon Flowers proclaimed. However, it is without doubt one of the best releases of 2006. One of the hallmarks of a classic record is that it stands up to repeated spins. For me, Sam's Town accomplishes this in spades. In fact, the more I become familiar with these songs the more I enjoy them.<br /><br />On this record one terrific song follows immediately on the heels of another. There are twelve tracks. The cd runs for just 44.14, once again proving that length is far less important than quality. Some of my favourite recent cds are about the same length as a traditional LP record (the second Arctic Monkeys is 37.34). As a die hard rock and roller I don't need filler and I don't want cuttings from the studio floor - tunes that would never previously have seen the light of day!<br /><br />Superficially this record reveals more American influences than the debut. There are the obvious vocal and lyrically similarities to Bruce Springsteen. Flowers has mentioned in interviews how he has \\"rediscovered America\\".  However, when all is said and done, what I hear are the same influences as on Hot Fuss - Queen, Bowie, and 80's Britmusic. Anyway, the band's sources of inspiration are, when all is said and done, irrelevant. This is a superb sophomore effort. I reserve five stars for the best of the best - Revolver, for example. Sam's Town is a worthy four and a half star effort. Will the Killers be able to make it a hat-trick? We'll see.
B000O75F7C|3.0|I have listened to this cd over and over trying to figure out how PT could go from \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" to this drivel. When I heard \\"Sentimental\\" you can hear a direct ripoff from \\"prodigal\\" on \\"In Absentia\\". Thats when I knew these guys needed a break. They shouldn't have put a cd so soon after \\"Deadwing\\". I love this band and this cd is only an average effort coming from them. I guess I always expect the best from such a great band.
0743289684|5.0|What an unusual autobiography we have in the form of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's \\"Infidel\\". I can't remember the last time I read a book as unique as this one. It's insightful, powerful, and talks about places in the world most of us in the West have little experience dealing with, let alone understanding. Ali, if you aren't familiar with her, was born in Somalia back in the late 1960s. She resided there for some time before heading off to live in Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Kenya before fleeing to the Netherlands in search of freedom from an arranged marriage set up by her father, a prominent Somali who spent years trying to topple the pro-communist Mohamed Siad Barre regime. Her tenure in Holland changed her life in several important ways. One, the choice to flee from her new husband caused irreparable damage to the connections she had with her family. Two, she came to understand the dangers radical Islam posed to the western world. Three, her absorption of western philosophical ideas led her to embrace democratic freedoms and oppose the subjugation of women under Islamic law. This stance, coupled with her embrace of atheism, brought her into direct conflict with fundamentalist Muslims.<br /><br />Ali recounts the difficulties inherent in living in third world countries in the first sections of the book. Sadly, Islam exacerbated these difficulties for the author. Women, as we all know by now, are treated as second-class citizens in most Islamic nations. The book overflows with sad depictions of arranged marriages, beatings, sexual repression, and other abuses best left unsaid here. One excellent example is Ali's mother, a proud woman who initially set out to achieve good things with her life but who eventually sank into despair and resorted to violence against her children because Islam forbade her to take an active role in resolving her marital and economic problems. Living in Ethiopia and Kenya wasn't so bad, according to the author, because both countries contain significant non-Muslim populations. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, was a nightmare. Ali didn't live in some corporate compound reserved for foreign oil workers. She lived right next door to the citizens, which exposed her to the full brunt of fundamentalist Islamic practices. Woman couldn't drive, couldn't go to the store without a male escort, and couldn't report domestic violence. The local populace blamed their problems on the influence of Jews.  What a world we live in, eh?<br /><br />The last part of the book details Ali's immigration to Holland and her subsequent rejection of Islam. A proud woman and a hard worker, she labored for years to learn the language, find employment in order to get off the public dole, and eventually earned a master's degree in political science from Leiden University. Her education led her to a job with the Social Democratic Party's think tank. She didn't stay here long due to her increasing disenchantment with Islam, brought about by her embrace of western philosophy, the September 11th terrorist attacks, and the realization that Muslims weren't assimilating into Dutch society. Ali eventually joined the conservative Liberal Party and ran for a seat in the Dutch parliament. She won, but her strong condemnations of Islamic practices along with her role in the death of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh (she made the film \\"Submission\\" with him, a short movie that attacked Islam's domination of women) brought down the wrath of Holland's \\"tolerant\\" politicos. They dug up the fact that she lied on her immigration forms and chased her out of politics. Death threats from fundamentalist Muslims resulted in her exodus to the United States. Today she works at the American Enterprise Institute.<br /><br />I'm leaving a ton of stuff out in these two brief paragraphs. \\"Infidel\\" is more than a quick jaunt through the Middle East and parts of Africa, although that would be interesting enough. Most readers will gain a better understanding about theseparts of the world after reading this book. For example, the author elucidates several theories about the third world that explains much about their proclivity for violence and civil war. She credits the tenets of Islam with much of the discord in the Middle East and Africa, a controversial theory that will find plenty of detractors. But it's her explanations about how the clan system works that add additional depth to her ideas. I don't think it's possible to understand the mess that Somalia is in today without understanding how clans work as both a form of economic support for citizens as well as a means of social classification. When you throw in Sunni and Shia distinctions, well, you've got a recipe for the sort of madness we're seeing in places like Iraq right now. The author also points out how Saudi Arabia's funding of radical Islam causes further chaos in these third world countries. What a seething cauldron!<br /><br />The most disturbing element of the book is the book itself. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a cry in the desert about what's really going on over in the Middle East and, with increasing regularity, Europe. Where are all the other voices that should chime in with additional evidence supporting this author's conclusions? Critics will tell you the paucity of Ali clones proves that she's dead wrong in her analysis, but we ought to know better. There aren't more people speaking out because they're afraid of becoming the next Theo van Gogh; they're afraid some Islamic fruitcake will stick a knife in their chest if they tell the truth. Look at what happened when this author spoke up. She had to go into hiding for weeks at a time in order to avoid execution. \\"Infidel\\" is a wake up call to the West just as surely as the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 were. We ignore the problem at our own peril. Even worse, we're endangering our children and our grandchildren by ignoring this problem. It's time to wake up and act before it's too late.reading this book.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|Well, if someone watches this movie with a broken heart from a recently ended relationship, her/his rating of this movie will raise up.  As a lady, I have formed a sympathy with the two ladies in this movie. I am glad the movie achieved this for me. The message of the movie is a simple but a strong one: one should follow the heart. A side message could be one would if love felt is strong enough. Another side message would be that one would if one knows love is mutual. I am mostly thinking of what Cameron Diaz and Jude Law acted for us. Sometimes men need to cry to present love is there and mutual. What is more important than love afterall? See what you would think, after having watched this movie!    <br />
B00005K3O0|4.0|Basically, AUDREY ROSE is to reincarnation what THE EXORCIST is to demon possession. A little girl named Ivy (Susan Swift) is plagued by terrible nightmares, or are they really memories from a former life? Anthony Hopkins (Magic, Silence Of The Lambs) seems to be stalking Ivy for some unknown reason. The girl's parents (Marsha Mason and John Beck) are both afraid and angered by the stranger's relentless pursuit of their daughter. What does he want? What secret motive drives him? The story unfolds well and gives a good sense of the building dread / terror experienced by Ivy's parents. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all fans of supernatural thrillers...
B00004Y6NX|5.0|1980 I was in Denver, CO before MTV.  There was a half-hour program on late at night called FMTV.  Videos!!!  The regular rotation included; Start Me Up - Stones, Controversy - Prince, Whip it - Devo and a couple pieces by a group I wasn't that familiar with...Romeo and Juliet and Tunnel of Love - Dire Straits.  They had me hook, line...you know.  To this day, along with Sultans of Swing and Brothers in Arms, I'm convinced that Mark Knofler is a rare bird, a true trubador.  He tells stories so damn well(not to mention he strokes axe mighty nice)that I never tire of his expressions.   <br /> <br />T of L reminds me of a girl I met when I was 18 at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, MO by the name of JoSylvia Malone.  We rode the 'Zambini Zinger' roller coaster together one time, I never saw her again, but this song describes that type of youthful passion perfectly...
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck is absolutely perfect as Jesse Stone, a character created by the great crime author Robert Parker. Selleck plays a burned out, alcoholic cop who takes a job in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts as sheriff. \\"Night Passage\\" is the tale of the quest by the emotionally damaged Stone for the killer of a young girl. William Devane costars as Jesse's shrink and he is excellent. Terrific secondary characters. In my opinion, Parker's Jesse Stone series of novels eclipses his famous Spenser books. This story line is the prequal to CBS's fabulously successful \\"Stone Cold\\", Selleck's first outing as Jesse Stone. Grab \\"Night Passage\\" . . . the Jesse Stone made-for-TV movies are quality productions with superb acting and beautiful cinematography. Stunning music. Exceptional TV. Highly, highly recommended. You don't ofter see TV this well done these days. You must also pick up [[ASIN:B0009FU0ZQ Stone Cold]] one of the best ever made for TV movies and [[ASIN:B000OVLBG2 Jesse Stone - Death In Paradise]].

B000J10EQU|4.0|While not my favorite movie, even superhero movie, I found the new take on Superman entertaining and somewhat nostalgic, having been a great fan of the comic books.  Being a kid and seeing Superman come to life on the big Screen with the Chris Reeve Superman was a wonderful treat.  But lets get real here people, it was a hokie watered down version of what superman really is.  Looking back on them now they seem even more campy than the old Golden Age of the Superman comics. <br /> <br />The newest version of the \\"movies\\" Superman in Superman Returns lends itself to the charater I knew more from the Comics.  He has feelings and serious things to deal with and acts like a person when confronted with problems and I think that Brandon Routh actually performs the character better than Reeve.  I think the direction they took the character is more realistic and thoughtful.  Spacey came across as Lutor fairly well in my opinion and I like the ease in which he slipped from sarcastic, know it all to egotistic, luny.  I liked the whole cast with the acception of Kate Bosworth as Lois.  Too young, immature looking and kind of absent emotionally.  I didn't much like the Lois in the origional Superman movies either. <br /> <br />The plot of the movie wasn't the most gipping.  The Luthor plan was interesting and reminicent of the Origional movie which I liked.(along with all the references to the Origional)  There seemed to be something missing from it though.  I think that a more interesting rout to go with  soty of Superman would have been the Doomsday conflict.  That would have significantly removed it from the previous films and I think they wanted to keep some continuity intact.  But it does stray from the canon of the Reeve films after 2 or 3, I'm not sue which.   <br /> <br />Over all I would like to see a sequal with the same actors but perhaps a more interesting plot.  I must say this movie did rekindled my enthusiasm for Superman which I thought was lost long ago.  For that alone I tip my hat.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|If you are looking at this web page right now, then you need to buy this movie immediately. <br /> <br />It is a masterpiece in every way. If you are tennative because of the film's reputation for violence, have no fear. This film is, in fact, not particularly violent, much less than Kill Bill or Seven. The only difference is that the protagonists are teenagers instead of adults, which is the reason this film was temporarily banned. <br /> <br />Nominated for the Japanse Academy Award for Best Picture, Battle Royal is both an insightful take on groupthink and hegemony in the world today, and a gripping suspense/drama that is thoroughly entertaining and completely satisfying.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I can't fathom the reviews that proclaim this as the best Bond ever?!?! I am a life long Bond fan, having seen and own, the movies and read books to accompany them. This doesn't make me any better than any other Bond fan, but I have an unflattering opinion of this train-wreck of a movie. I was disappointed when Pierce Brosnan stepped down as Bond, but I was willing to give Daniel Craig a shot at it. After all, I didn't think anyone could butcher the job the way Timothy Dalton did. Boy, oh boy. This movie could kill the franchise. Reinventing Bond is ludicrous. Taking out his calm, cool assuredness and replacing it with hot headed response, I shed a tear. Then the writers had Bond leave a beautiful woman in the middle of a passionate moment to chase her terrorist male counterpart. James Bond WOULD NEVER do that. A real Bond would spend the night with the lovely lady and give her a gentle kiss before giving chase. Taking Bond back to the rank of normal \\"O\\" status had me shaking my head. Bond playing Hold 'Em poker (a nod to a current fad)instead of his game of choice baccaratte. In fact, if you read the book, Bond is playing baccaratte... the movie guys changed it, obviously figuring that they knew Bond better than Ian Fleming. What idiots.   Another thing. What was one of the best points of Bond movies? For me it is the \\"over the top\\" bad guys that Bond fights. They never showed up in this flick. Instead we got a bad guy who was a weeping sissy. He owed money to other bad guys and was playing poker to try and win the cash. Those bad guys probably should have been Bond's prey. The guy Bond chases is no super villian. He's all to human. He has asthma, shakes in the company of real bad guys and begs for mercy when caught.    Does anyone remember Bond movies with real hokey contraptions that the meanies would put Bond into when they wanted him dispatched? This movie replaces those contraptions with a chair and a naked Bond getting hit in the genitals by a heavy rope?!?!(say what) Bond gets hit in those family jewels by none other than the weeping bad guy himself. No henchmen, no fortress, no Q, no fancy gadgets... No Bond Movie!    The lone high point of the movie, and the reason I gave it 2 stars was the chase scene early on in the movie. Incredible. Probably the best chase scene I have ever seen! And it was ON FOOT!!!
B000NQR7NO|4.0|Hype is unfair to everyone involved, be it the artist being held to lofty expectations, or to the fan, who rarely can have expectations met.  Arctic Monkeys are trapped in the Hype controversey which is unfair, and ignores the band's talent and ability.  Their first album was amazing, and with catchy hooks for a fun night on the town.  Some liked it, others didn't.  This second album will most likely not change anyone's mind who did not like the first.  First, the band chose a darker sound with a harsher edge, hurting the fun aspect of the first album.  Then there is the issue that there are nothing quite as catchy as I Bet You Look Good On the Dance Floor.  But that would again put them into an unfair expectation category to judge them by their past album.  As an album, this is a great record, the music works, tight production, and feels like something to put in your car when out on a saturday night with friends.  An excellent album.  Enjoy it.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Aside from its super excellent story, acting, production, soundtrack, and all Oscar best movie categories which I would certainly award all to this movie, I was extremely touched as a Muslim by the final scene of Saladin placing the falling Cross on the table after entering Jerusalem. What a great expression of respect.<br /><br />I believe this movie came at the right time, as people of different religions must learn how to live together in tolerance and peace, and I think this is what viewers should also see between the lines of the story.<br /><br />If this movie didn't hit, I can understand why from a political consideration and nothing else, but those who are interested in a brighter future learned from our present and past should indeed watch the movie. I guarantee to you that as much as you'll have a great deal of entertainment, you'll get also something else that would change the world.
B00005J6T1|3.0|Back in the early 80s, Madonna had already been a good songwriter; more importantly, she had also been a good collaborator. Unlike many singer-songwriters with strong egos, she left much space for Producer Reggie Lucas to make her debut album; she even sang several songs written by the others as well. While the album ended up filled in with halfway Motown-esque songs, Madonna's proven talent as a collaborator would pave her way to go, along with her own brilliant songs like \\"Lucky Star,\\" which shines brightly enough to foresee her decades to come.
B000O1799U|3.0|This film was widely acclaimed for it's powerful music, and it's awe-inspiring Oscar nominated performances by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. While I agree the music was nice, and the performances overall were fairly solid...I just didn't feel awed or inspired.<br /><br />\\"Dreamgirls\\" chronicles the trials and tribulations of an African American girl group called the 'Dreamettes' as they struggle to top the pop charts in a hostile 1960's social environment. Effie (Jennifer Hudson) is the lead singer of the group, with power-house vocals, and star quality. After Effie is pushed aside in the group to allow the skinnier, prettier Deena (Beyonce Knowles) to take the lead, resentment builds within Effie as the group starts to take-off into stardom.<br /><br />Musicals can be a tricky thing to bring to life on film. How does one address the issue of at least semi-believabley explaining why the main characters are periodically bursting into song? The 2002 Best Picture winner [[ASIN:B00005JLSE Chicago (Widescreen Edition)]] solved this dilemma by depicting the music and dance numbers as taking place within the confines of Roxy Hart's imagination. Unfortunately, \\"Dreamgirls\\" seemed like it couldn't make up it's mind as far as the logistics of the music numbers. At first all the songs are performed onstage by the various music groups, which is a perfectly real and believable occurence. Then, however, the film suddenly switches gears and has the actors begin to burst out into song in the middle of a scene. This change of cinematography is a little disorienting, and kind of off-putting. As if thats not enough, the movie begins drifting back and forth between the two versions. I think it would have been better, and far more enjoyable, if the film had simply chosen one format and stuck with it.<br /><br />The story is obviously loosely based on the popular girl group \\"The Supremes\\", who featured Diana Ross as it's lead singer. As it is, Diana Ross became very upset with the portrayal of the 'Dreamettes' in this film -- not because she took offense to the portrayal in reference to her roots singing with 'The Supremes', but because she claimed the story portrayed in \\"Dreamgirls\\" was altered only just enough to avoid paying her royalties for use of her story. Either way, the music in the film was incredible at first, and then slowly began to grow tiresome. After awhile, all the songs sounded the same! There wasn't much variety at all, which made me grow bored with it enough to start fast-forwarding through some of them.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, I think that all the actors did a great job. This was truly an all-star cast, with the new-comer Jennifer Hudson snagging the only Academy Award for her performance. I have a feeling I might upset some fans with this next comment but...after watching this film I kind of felt like Jennifer Hudson, while her performance was great (especially for it being her first film ever) wasn't entirely deserving of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She's a phenomenal singer, as many will witness in this film, but I'm just not sure her acting was worth an Academy Award.<br /><br />The only special features available on this single-disc edition are alternate/extended scenes, and a music video \\"Listen\\" by Beyonce Knowles. If you enjoy having a wide variety of special features, it would be better to purchase the 2-disc special edition.<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is a bit of a mixed bag. Nice music, good acting, and absolutely gorgeous costume design. Fans of musicals will enjoy it more than the rest of the population, but it's certainly worth at least one viewing.tes' in this film -- not because she took offense to the portrayal in reference to her roots singing with 'The Supremes', but because she claimed the story portrayed in \\"Dreamgirls\\" was altered only just enough to avoid paying her royalties for use of her story.

B000N4SHPS|4.0|I enjoyed this one a lot. Stallone returns to his humble roots and tells a satisfying story to bring the saga to its final conclusion. This is Sly's finest acting next to Cop Land, First Blood, and the original Rocky. I hope he continues to write and direct more projects of this nature. I am looking forward to his Edgar Allen Poe biopic.

B00003CXBK|3.0|This movie was a bit cheesie. Also there was way too much blood and gore. And the story was just a bit to predictible otherwise not bad.
B00018TI5E|5.0|I was a fairly self-proclaimed RHCP fan around the time I picked this album up.  I kicked myself repeatedly for not realizing that John does work separate from the peppers earlier than I did (around summer of 2004 that is).  Anyway, I found out he did solo work and I found this album in my local record store one day and decided to pick it up.  I popped it in my car on the way back, and was literally blown away. <br /> <br />It's not the sheer fact that John makes music this interesting to me.  It's the whole story behind his music, where he's come from, how dedicated to his work he is and his ongoing ability to output, maybe not perfect, but truly amazing work consistently.  I was very fortunate to pick this album up when I did, it just so happened that The Will to Death came out only two weeks later and I basically was bombarded with John Frusciante for the next six to eight months. <br /> <br />However, out of all the albums that he's made, Shadows Collide with People has always seemed to me to be the most genuine John.  Combine the earlier self-depreciating, drug-ridden works of Smile from the Streets you Hold and Niandra Lades and Usually just a T-shirt, the original vision and creativity of to Record Only Water for Ten Days, the output quantity and variety of his six albums in six months campaign and polish it up just a little, and that's Shadows Collide With People.  It's really the sum of all the parts coming together. <br /> <br />There are some very clever depictions of John's past in this album as well.  \\"Wednesday's Song\\", which depicts his favoring of one specific prostitue once a week around the time of BSSM, is a great example of this.  I would certainly classify this album as the one to introduce others to his solo works, it's certainly his most accessible but doesn't sacrifice too much to that fact either.  The electronic influence of other of his works is evident too in tracks such as \\"Double-0Ghost27\\", \\"Failure 33 Object\\", and \\"23 Go In To End\\".  For some reason, \\"Chances\\" throws me back to the Beatles in some aspects and is always a nice fun, quick listen.  And \\"The Slaughter\\" is just a song I could listen to over and over again, the absolute perfect way to end the album. <br /> <br />In short, Shadows Collide with People currently is and likely will be my favorite John Frusciante album.  It does truly have \\"something for all his fans.\\"  Tracking John's growth as a musician both solo and with the chili peppers is something I continue to enjoy day after day and this is certainly, in my opinion, the best place to start.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There is nothing better. There are no better documentaries. There are no better HD discs. There are no better passive promotions of conservation. There is no better cinematography. There is no better insight into animal behavior. I could go on. <br /> <br />Planet Earth is at the top of its class. I can't really say much that hasn't been said about this before, but it's simply magnificent. I enjoyed every second of this series. <br /> <br />The narrative is striking, the footage is unprecedented, the score is rousing, and these are THE discs to pop in when someone asks you \\"What's better about HD?\\". <br /> <br />If you're a fan of nature documentaries, HD in general, or just quality filmmaking, there should be little debate about purchasing this. Get it. This is one of the finest purchases I've ever made and some of the greatest 9 hours and 15 minutes I've ever spent in front of a TV screen. Wonderful.
B000002I2M|5.0|L.A. Woman's overall brilliance notwithstanding, Ray Manzarek's piano solo in the title song must certainly be counted amongst the most joyous twenty-four seconds in rock history.

B000MNP2K8|1.0|Two and a half hours of plodding dialogue and mediocre acting, occasionally relieved by a faint scintilla of action and a new James Bond with all the charm and sophistication of a truck driver easily make this one of the worst in the long series of Bond films
B00005JPAO|5.0|Always having been fascinated by the Royals, (especially Princess Dianna)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />It is centered at the time that the Princess died, and the Queen came under such negative scrutiny for her lack of emotion, and her failure to make a public statement about her death.<br /><br />Although I am not saying that the Queen was right in her silence, I DO now have a clearer understanding of Royal tradition,and protocol. I now understand her silence a little better.<br /><br />Even though the Queen clearly did not like her ex Daughter-in-Law, It still was/is not customary to show one's feelings in public in the Royal family.<br /><br />Viewing this film brought the period of Diana's death back like it was yesterday, and I liked how they added live footage of her throughout the film.Like millions of others, I admired the Princess, and will watch this film many times to come.<br /><br />Also, I now have a new respect for the Queen. This really is a wonderful movie!
1582406723|3.0|Perfect example of what hype does... Hype sells these types of graphic novels more than the story does. If enough people enjoy something it gets popular. Look at McDonalds. This is way too mainstream. It's cliché after cliché. Boring. Guns, Zombies, and Cops. Couldn't get more boring. It's so boring and so predicable that it seems like a Junior High School student wrote it. Similar story to Stephen King's Cell. Why would I care about a cop trying to find his family? That's just my opinion so don't get your panties in a bunch you fanboys. I'm entitled to my opinion as much as you are... and I didn't like it.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|I have to say, I shamefully bought the first 3 seasons on seperate packages before I found this gem, However, i managed to sell off the seperate packaged seasons fairly easy and made most of my money back without much hassle. <br /> <br />Considering the story: I found Alias to be quite amazing to watch really, you cant help but become totally absorbed by the whole story, and with the joy (or pain) of not having ad breaks and being able to start on the next disc almost instantly leaves you watching TV for a good few hours! Sydney's character, however fragile and weak its made out to be, is actually quite well drawn out with all the other characters, from Vaughn to her sister Nadia, I found it all quite made and certainly worth the watch.  <br /> <br />However, my only gripe was the way it was made, was it me or did anyone notice the HUGE build up to the middle of every episode with some impossible mission to accomplish? I found this quite tiresome and expecting, and actually I found myself fowarding through most of them after about three seasons of it. The narrow escaping and fighting off numerous security guards/ extras became almost too boring for me, but made me want to focus on the rest of the story because of it. MaYbE wE nEeD mOrE hIgHtEck/iMpOsSiblE t4sK tO Do LOLOL. <br /> <br />This boxset is worth it, but will annoy you because of the way its packaged in a book like  setting with mangnets in the box making it a bit of a mess if the whole thing isnt packed away properly. <br /> <br />I'm also wondering if many people found the extra dvd thats hidden in this boxset ;)Write if you did, its an interesting little find. <br /> <br />Overall: Worth it with expected cliche's played on. Will be watching this with friends for years to come.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Sometimes there are actors that the press and fans love to abuse, for whatever reason. Whatever that actor's in, they look for ways to poke fun at it, even if they give some slack to very similar movies with other actors in it. It seems to me that this is what's happened to Kingdom of Heaven.<br /><br />The story is an interesting and timely one. Back in medieval days, there was an uneasy truce between the Christian king who held Jerusalem and the Muslims which surround the city. Not all Christians believe this friendship is wise, and soon enough there is a large scale war going on for the city. Only Orlando Bloom, in the shape of a young bastard blacksmith named Balian, can step in to try to save the population from being wiped out.<br /><br />I admit that after several watchings there are still a few things which strike me as very funny or odd. The fact that Balian's father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson) shows up and says \\"Hey there, I'm the one who raped your mom. Although she protested, I don't think she really minded\\". The way Godfrey trains his son in all the arts of fine swordsmanship in one 15-minute session.<br /><br />When Balian goes out to his father's lands, he finds a dry desert, with many families living on it. He promptly decides to dig a well in about 2 hours they have a well with water and full irrigation going. What, none of the locals ever thought to try digging to find water? Were they all standing around, like little AI-less villagers in a badly designed video game, waiting for someone to click on them? It seems like only days afterwards that the entire landscape is green and lush.<br /><br />You really can't blame Orlando Bloom for any of this. He is told to read his lines and to go through his paces - he can't take responsibility for a poorly written script or odd dialogue. He does reasonbly well with the lines he's given - rage at a deceptive priest, angst over a lost love, courage in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />I love battle movies in general, and I greatly appreciated the cavalry charges, castle assaults and other such scenes in the movie. I did had to laugh at a number of very obvious Lord of the Ring similarities though. It's hard not to chuckle when you have \\"Legolas\\" up on a tower wall, watching the siege towers roll on in. You're looking for those cave trolls.<br /><br />I also found it exceedingly convenient that a man who claims throughout the entire movie that he is of the utmost high moral character - to the point of risking the entire city of Jerusalem's safety in order to preserve his moral code - has no problem at all hopping into bed with a married woman. I guess morals can be set aside when you've got a sexy babe in your arms.<br /><br />Still, all in all it was a fun romp through medieval days, and the supporting cast like Jeremy Irons were great. I like how the movie tells a fair amount of the story from the Muslim side, and how the Muslim ruler is the one to pick up a knocked-over cross and set it back upright. The message that respect can be found for all religions is a healthy one that I'd like to see more of.general, and I greatly appreciated the cavalry charges, castle assaults and other such scenes in the movie.

If you are intrigued by the possibilities of how time can be bent and how what we do may or may not be able to influence the past and the future, then you will enjoy this movie. Add in some fantastic performances by Denzel Washington Paula Patton Val Kilmer and others and you have a splendid evening of entertainment ahead of you.  This movie is fast paced, intriguing and will leave you pondering what happened and the various possibilities.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|The Pursuit of Happyness stars Will Smith and is inspired by a true story. This is a film of love and sacrifice and persistence. It is the story of a man who finds one avenue of life isn't working, so he stretches beyond the odds and tackles another possibility. It costs him his wife, he ends up losing his home, but through it all, he and his son are together and they defeat the odds. This is a feel good story, but before you get to the feel good part, you are going to feel bad. You are going to find yourself unable to believe what a person can take and how they can pick themselves up and keep on going. You are going to find yourself maybe kicking yourself in the butt a little bit (or a lot) for not showing a tenth of the iniaitive in life as Chris Gardner(played by Will Smith) does in this movie. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this spectacular film yet, don't wait anymore! Rent it or buy it or borrow it from a friend. This drama will touch your heart and give you a new understanding of Thomas Jefferson's words: \\"The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\" <br />
1563894696|4.0|I loved it. Jeff Loeb is a real traditionalist when it comes to the characters he's writing. I've read tons of his books and he doesn't re-invent the character but keeps the traditional ideas going. The art is great and the stories are classic. Everybody and anyone could pick this up and enjoy it. It's a great example of a graphic novel. I think of comics as the baby of novels and movies. Art is alive in comics! Instead of watching TV try reading this. It's a great book.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head's past is nothing along the lines of consistent. Their debut \\"Burn my Eyes\\" is widely considered one of the most classic thrash albums of the 90's and among Machine Head die-hards, their best album that could never be touched, even by MH themselves. Their follow up \\"...The More Things Change\\", while remaining true to their thrash roots was subpar on the songwriting. Then \\"The Burning Red\\" came out, causing a division among MH fans. Some fans dismissed the effort, labeling it Nu Metal and basically calling the band a sellout. Others, including myself, appreciated the band's new direction and realized that this wasn't MH trying to be like every other mainstream metal band. Instead, they were showing everyone else how it should be done. The next effort \\"Supercharger\\" is widely considered to be the band's biggest flop. However, there was a light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" exploded onto the scene and silenced all their more critical fans that said that they had went soft and didn't know how to write good songs anymore.<br /><br />Now, we come to \\"The Blackening\\", which some are saying surpasses the almighty \\"Burn my Eyes\\", and others are still saying no way. I say, it's different times and they're a different band now. It's sort of unfair to compare the two. In any event, Machine Head have delivered a stellar, uncompromised, amazingly heavy and refreshingly musically tight effort. Although it's early in the year, I have a feeling it will come within the the top five metal releases of 2007. From the opener \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\" it's clear that they're not fooling around. They raised up the ante big time. The whole album is unrelenting and doesn't release it's grip from you until the rousing finale \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", a track which start off slow(er) but finishes with a section typical of the rest of the album. This album is flawless, in the sense that there are no skippable tracks. The rhythms are pounding. The riffsare heavy and well thought out. The lead work is amazing and more progressive than ever before. It will be a long while before I'll feel the need to go back in MH's catalog and listen to another album. This one has everything a metal fan can ask for. Way to go, Machine Head!
B000003ER4|5.0|This belongs to the great operas of the 20th Century. The music is ravishing from start to finish and Leinsdorf is at his peak of conducting. Even the first hearing of it is easy on the ear while hearing it repeatedly justs whets the apetite for more discovery of the great hidden medolies. Its different from the vocal writing of the Wagnerian and Straussian operas. The composer was applauded by Strauss, Mahler ( who called him a genius) and Puccini. What greater compliments can one obtain. The recording, I concur with others, is one of the finest I have heard which puts modern technology to shame. BUY it and you wont regret it ever. And, by the way, read the reviews of the DVD versions of the opera although this is performance is not on DVD,
B000N3ST9I|4.0|The Blackening is a great metal record. And as close to Burn My Eyes as they have come in a long time. Modern thrash is the best way i think to describe their sound. With most songs over seven minutes long as you can imagine they have many differente sections and pacings within a song. Songs like clenching the fist of dissent, and a farewell to arms are two of my favorite songs and the best examples of how some of the songs start slower and build to their violent heavy conclusion. While a song like wolves has a similar sound but i find to become repetitive and drag a bit toward the end. And now i lay thee down goes nowhere and is closes to sounding geared toward radio. Slanderous is another one of my favorites which is except for the chorus part a pretty straight up thrash song. Beautiful morning is a very good song as well thrashing out of the gates to slow down toward the middle to include the much improved clean vocals which are displayed to great effect at the begining of a farewell to arms which was mentioned earlier. Asthetics of hate is a strong song as well written about the article printed after dimebag darrels death it is filled with seething hate toward the horrible things written about him by someone who never knew him. Anyone longing for the glory days of machine heads debut should be pleased as this is the most vital to and angry they have sounded in awhile. Sounding sort of like through the ashes of empires only within song structures as i find through the ashes..... to be only a three star album, and not as good as it is considered by others to be. My compaints the length of the songs sometimes work against them as in wolves which seems to drag instead of develope the song more and now i lay thee down which is the most uninspired sounding song on the album.
B000AP04OM|5.0|If you like musicals and Julie Andrews, this DVD is tops. As in the VHS version, the DVD is even better in video and audio quality.  Like the other reviews, the breath taking scenery, songs, story, and Julie are tops! But after all, any of Rodgers and Hammerstein's works are great musicals.<br /><br />What's nice about the R&H annivesary sets are the extra video clips of the stars and other takes. This DVD is no exception as they included a great clip on Julie and Christopher Plummer and the town itself.<br /><br />Bottom line is if you like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Julie<br /><br />Andrews, you'll like this DVD!
0099422697|4.0|Now that Bellow has died, Roth is probably the greatest living American novelist, a position reinforced by his late period spurt that has produced such masterpieces as The Human Stain and American Pastoral. His capacious understanding of American culture, his super stylish wordsmanship and his deep perception of the male psyche raises him to another level. The Dying Animal serves as a sort of coda to his Americana trilogy. The protagonist, David Kepesh, randy libertine professor who abandoned his wife and kids in the 60s for a life of sexual and intellectual freedom has appeared earlier in Roth's work, but he returns here as a sixty something professor of culture who staves of encroching mortality by revitalising himself with sexual affairs with his young female students. He confesses that such affairs don't 'give you a last shot at youth'. Far from it, they actually reinforce the age gap between the 'Dying Animal' - taken from a Yeats poem, and the virility of youth, where time is measured backwards from where you started, rather than in terms of how long you have left.<br /><br />Still, Roth is the laureate of libido, and knows more than anyone the value of a decent shag to rebuff the Thanatos slide, however fleetingly. Kepesh is a master at this, living an elegant, sophisticated single life in a book lined apartment. A lifestyle that drives his female students crazy. He encounters Consuela, a sultry Cuban girl who comes to realise the sexual power she holds over him by virtue of her stupendous breasts. When she allows Kepesh to lick her menstrual blood, he has been taken in completely. Kepesh tells the story of his affair with this girl, stitching it into context in terms of American sexual relationships as they have developed since the 1960s, with reference to the 'Gutter Girls' - memories of Kepesh's younger days.<br /><br />The ending, which coincides with the Millennium celebrations, the fireworks around the world staging a mockery of the nuclear fear the world has felt since 1945, hits you like a leaden punch to the stomach. Age, youth, mortality, virility are not as simple and clean cut as surface perceptions suggest.he world has felt since 1945, hits you like a leaden punch to the stomach. Age, youth, mortality, virility are not as simple and clean cut as surface perceptions suggest.
