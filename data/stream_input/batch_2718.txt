B00BW0QC8G|5.0|This works great for my grandson to take to school.  There are many handy pockets for carrying lots of stuff.  His laptop and Kindle fit nicely.  Seems well-made and sturdy.  He particularly likes the wide straps that don't dig into his shoulders.  Very pleased so far.

0385343248|5.0|A great novel, as are all of the books in this series.  the characters come to life on the pages of this book, their hopes, dreams, demons, and desires.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is fantastic!!! it has a huge variety of all dragons which I love, it's also fun if you like being in charge of a park that you must manage to get more interesting dragons. The only downer is you have to wait when your building things clearing things and incubating dragon eggs. If you love Dragons and if you love to be the boss of things (your park) this game is for you.  Have fun!!

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a little deep if you are not in the medical field - but was an awesome read.  Encouraging and thought provoking.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|After the 2nd time checking this out at the library for my 2 year old, I decided to buy it for her. Very cute, great music (especially the songs sung by Ed Helms) and a story that provides a good lesson. I had never read the book, and to be honest, didn't really care for it. It seemed a little heavy-handed and my daughter quickly lost interest in it-and she will listen to me read almost anything. But it's a cute movie overall.
1419705644|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this encyclopedia full of new Adventure Time art. It's written from the point of view of Marceline's dad, king of the Nightosphere, with faux-written-in comments by Marceline, Finn, and Jake (I'm pretty sure multiple authors commenting on the main body makes it experimental post-modern awesome! Unfortunately they never say much). It's more than just an alphabetical listing of most of the Adventure Time characters; things like Princess Bubblegum's Travel Guide to Ooo and the Ice King Fiona and Cake Zine give it a miscellany feel.<br /><br />The design is really impressive for licensed cartoon merchandise. Children will probably like all the pictures, and teens/adults can enjoy Abadeer's delightful circumlocutions, although he does get annoyingly hyper-self-aware (and the tone of his writing is inconsistent). The writing could have been a bit better, but it's still entertaining. I chuckled more than once! If you're a fan of the show you should totally buy this book! You will love it. If you're buying it for a child, just know that it assumes the reader has a large vocabulary (words like \\"masticating\\" \\"ninny\\" and \\"bevy\\" are common, which might discourage a 10-year-old. Or it might encourage them, who knows).<br /><br />This Encyclopedia makes this reader happy, nay, giddy, when its contents enter range of her orbicular sight sensors (did you find that circumlocution funny or annoying? More of the same awaits you in this Encyclopedia).

B004NS710C|4.0|This was a great movie loosly based upon real events.  A great movie that shows how 2 people with vastly different attitudes, outlooks and entire lifestyles can come together and forge a team that is unstoppable.  The beginning is slightly slow, but quickly picks up pace only shortly after the intro.  After the beginning it is sure to keep you seated as one challenge after another arises.  Some language, and some mild accident violence occurs.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This is a new twist on the Jack and the Beanstalk tale, where there is more history involved and more than just a robber who survives.  If you love movies such as Willow, Eragon, Dragonslayer and such your sure to like this one.  If your just a critic, I cant help you as there is always something to dislike in any movie.  All around a good story that is safe for the whole family.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Be warned, that if you begin this journey you will have to wait years to finish it.  My greatest disappointment was when the movie ended and I knew I had to wait until the rest of the trilogy was finished.  As with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, there are many aspects changed from book to movie, but the director kept to the heart of the story as much as is possible whenever trying to take a book and make it on film.  I can criticize all the things that are different, or I can simply say I expected as much, and that by itself this is a great adventure.  Clean wholesome fun, adventure, singing, laughter, and plenty of surprises.

B001N9ESQ4|2.0|So they meet after 9 years and- no kiss! Gimme a break! How can two people talk so much and waste such valuable time, in Paris, with unrequited love oozing all over, opportunity abundant and nothing happens.  The last scene was cute (hence the second star) but what a waste of time, especially after the first movie.  Dialogue only goes so far. It should lead somewhere but they just kept talking, and talking...

B0044C5SCU|5.0|of Fringe. Of course it's fantastical and there are many flaws, but that is what this type of show is all about - Fringe Science - bizarre and the weird The characters as are so very good. Even Dr. Bishop who is the crazed scientist is reeled in before his character veers too far of course. It's all about balance. And what an excellent play to kill of characters but still have them on the shows. Once I finish all the seasons there will surely be a void in my entertainment life....
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie should be rated R. There is a great deal of nudity, sexual content and foul language. Story line was funny, acting great. Could have been a good movie without so many sex scenes and over use of the &#34;f word&#34;.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|A friend read this book and recommended it for our book club. She said she could not put it down and that the ending surprised her! So, I thought we should read it and recommended it for the group. I found it as interesting as she said it would be. At times it was confusing, but I got what was going on when I got to the end. At our book club, several found it confusing and did not enjoy reading it. I explicated what I thought was going on throughout the book and think they got it. I hope I got it too. So, some might like it and some might now, but that is the way it goes with any book!

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's background in neuroscience provided him with a solid foundation by which to comprehend the nuts and bolts of how brains and neurons work, but all the medical and scientific training in the world could not prepare him for his extraordinary near death experience (NDE). While some cognitive scientists consider NDEs as pure flights of fancy put on courtesy of misfiring neurons, Dr. Alexander was able to rule out such possible explanations in his case, due to the fact that he was in a coma for six days, infected with gram-negative E.coli bacterial meningitis.<br /><br />What I love most about Dr. Alexander's description of his near death experience is the way he describes the hyper-reality of that state of being, together with an exceptionally close and loving sense of connection with those he met there.<br /><br />Clearly, there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in most of our scientific philosophies. Thanks to Dr. Alexander, a dialogue about our true nature and the reality of consciousness can begin.

159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is possibly one of the most gifted writers I've had the pleasure to read. His books show a part of Afghanistan and its people that I could never get from other sources.<br /><br /> In the case of And the Mountains Echoed, the story of a family ripped apart at first by circumstance and then by war unfolds. Courage and cowardice are found where unexpected; difficult decisions made, families destroyed and families flourish. All told elegantly, empathetically, and with an underlying but quiet message of hope that things will get better, wounds will heal, and families will reunite.

B005723JSQ|3.0|I've Got Your Number by Sophie Kinsella is the story about one unlucky wacky and at times exasperating Poppy Wyatt.  Poppy is about to get married to the most perfect man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her life starts to falls apart - she loses the family heirloom engagement ring in a hotel fire drill and then her phone is stolen but someone has tossed their mobile away.  In comes businessman Sam Roxton said owner of tossed mobile phone and he wants the company phone back.  As the story evolves Poppy and Sam are constantly butting into each other through emails and text all while Poppy it trying to juggles wedding preparations and hiding her engagement hand to Magnus and his parent .. ahh by Poppy is in for even a bigger surprises.<br /><br />It took me some time to get into this book - I found Poppy annoying at times especially with all the `footnote' comments.  Once we got past the whole `lost ring' I warmed up to the book and had a few good chuckles.  This audiobook was narrated by Jayne Entwistle and whom I enjoyed.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|In a way, I was a bit disappointed in this book, as Dawkins mostly reviews a number of key ideas developed in modern science -- physics, organic chemistry, evolution.  His treatment is at about the level of a high school student -- and that's good.  He is especially clever at finding everyday analogies to what would otherwise be difficult concepts.  For example, he explains the physics of a rainbow in a way that avoids the messy optics of spherical droplets, and how they act as little prisms in breaking up the white light of the sun into a spectrum.<br />But I learned much more from his other books, for example, The Blind Watchmaker, The Selfish Gene and Unweaving the Rainbow, which I can highly recommend.  He is at his best in discussing the biology of evolution.
B003OUXECE|5.0|If you are considering reading this book, then you have either played the games or are playing them now.  This review is solely a personal opinion but if you're reading this I assume that means you're seeking an opinion.<br /><br />This book, for me, was read AFTER I had played both games.  I loved the original Bioshock, but alas was one of the naysayers concerning its sequel.  It just did not resonate with me.  Then this book was released and upon reading its final pages I sat back in my chair, sighed, and immediately popped in Bioshock 2.  This book completely ties the two games together in a way that brings their narratives even further to the forefront.  I love Bioshock 2 now and this book is why.  Rapture is one of those books that reads like you're watching a film.  It's very good easy-reading.  What's even better is that for all of the Bioshock universe's complexities in morality, religion, politic, faith (in Rapture or its citizens) the book never waves the themes at your face as if it's screaming, \\"This is what you're supposed to understand!\\"  These notions and themes are very naturally inserted through the characters' dialog very much like the audio logs in the games (in some cases exactly like the game).<br /><br />The core of the book is an origin story told through the experiences of McDonagh, who is recruited by Andrew Ryan to build his city under the sea.  I love the choice for protagonist here.  McDonagh is a simple level-headed mind surrounded by geniuses who no longer are bound by any rules.  We all know this is what causes Rapture to fall, but the way we see it through the eyes of the man who built it to raise his family in is heartbreaking to the very end.<br /><br />It's a fantastic read, I really can't understand the negativity I have found in some of the reviews, but their opinions are their own just like mine.<br />Again, if you were one like me who did not love the second game, I encourage you to read this book and try again!

Add some classic PSB lyrics, and this isn't the run of the mill, corporate, collection of generic dance tracks you're likely to hear on the radio here in the states.

B000RT5XVA|5.0|This novel begins with a drought and ends with a flood--natural disasters that serve as bookends to a parade of human-inflicted hardships and trials. For the `Okies' the Great Depression was merely the prelude to the Dust Bowl that wiped out the homes and everything these farm people had ever worked their lives to provide for themselves. The pot of gold at the end of their rainbow is merely a mirage, enticing them further west like the proverbial carrot for the mule. The drama keeps replaying itself; only the props have changed. There is a compelling quality and an irresistible urge to keep reading novels of characters pushed to extreme limits of endurance and survival. Just as much as Robinson Crusoe, the migrants of `The Grapes of Wrath' are shipwrecked in an untenable situation where creative ingenuity and persistence are essential to their survival.<br /><br />John Steinbeck's novel has been justifiably praised and it is understandable that it has been seen as almost the definitive saga of the hardships of the Depression. I first read it over thirty years ago and the characters have become idealized in my memory. I misremembered them, probably because the power of the heroic and relentless drive to persevere in spite of overwhelming odds overshadowed the fact that these characters are filled with flaws, insecurity, selfishness and vanity and yet the instinct for survival is so strong within them that it pulls them beyond their endurance and the tolerance of anything they ever thought they would consider doing.<br /><br />Steinbeck's Joad family is not naturally heroic or particularly altruistic. They want what most people want--security, an intact family, their own home, a way to support themselves. Despite their best intentions, their notions of what the family is and where they are determined to go are completely tossed aside by the intervention of unexpected circumstance.<br /><br />The unlikely hero of the family is ex-con Tom, just out of prison and on parole, which he breaks when he leaves the state with his family to head west. Tom's righteous indignation and bad temper has already resulted in him killing one man. It requires immense self-control to refrain from retaliation at the taunts and injustice the family suffer all the way to California from western `natives' who fear that the `Okies' (substitute any kind of racial or ethnic epithet for an equivalent insult) will take away their jobs and the authorities who jump in to quell any glimmers of burgeoning unionizing. Younger brother Al, who idolizes Tom and emulates his brother in many ways with an added dose of sexual bravado and general cockiness, is impetuous and just wants to get married and work in a garage somewhere. The pregnant Rose of Sharon is deserted by her husband, an emotional child despite impending motherhood, pines for Connie and tries to console herself with the thought that he will come back for her after he gets settled and finds them a home. Pa and his brother John are weak patriarchs. John is consumed with guilt over a `sin' that he has blown into a badge of honor as well as an avoidance mechanism. Pa grumbles and is occasionally assertive and decisive but is ultimately humbled by Ma's authority. Ma is the rock of the family. She is the foundation upon which all of them rest, the real spiritual leader of the family.<br /><br />The ex-preacher Jim Casy is an enlightened spiritual guide. His initials underscore his Christ figure status. He has been to the wilderness and come to a realization that is reminiscent of Emerson's `oversoul', that he is part of a collective soul, one with all other life on the planet. He sacrifices himself once by turning himself in to the authorities in place of another man who killed a policeman, serves his jail time and returns as an active unionizer in a camp where the Joads coincidentally find themselves. Steinbeck sees unionizing as true Christianity and Casy is its sacrificial prophet. After killing the man who killed Casy, Tom is a fugitive. He tells Ma before he leaves that he is now part of that soul that Casy spoke of and he is essentially continuing Casy's crusade for justice.<br /><br />Men in the novel are characterized as reactors to the fits and starts of circumstances whereas women literally `go with the flow' of the ongoing river of life. The feminine nurturing aspect ushers the continuation of life and the recycling of energy and nourishment--literally in the eerily beautiful final scene of the novel, a conclusion that could never have been filmed in the world of 1940 when the acclaimed film version was released.<br /><br />Steinbeck's novel was a controversial powder keg when it was ignited and released to the public of 1939 and it retains all of its power over seventy years later. The Great Depression, the Dust Bowl and the Okies were all elements of a particular point in history. Injustice, inequality between rich and poor and the plight of the homeless and the unemployed are still with us in a world where `The Grapes of Wrath' has lost none of its relevance.o killed Casy, Tom is a fugitive.

B0090SI4LU|4.0|I liked it because of the fresh sci-fi twist: two entities living in the same woman's body who fall in love with two different men. Interesting to see how the two fell in love with their respecting men, how the men (one of which hated her (both?) at the time but who later changed, and the conflicts which went on with all concerned - of which there were many across several spectrums.<br /><br />I wished the movie took longer to develop and explain certain scenes - which one is partially answered in the \\"deleted scenes\\" section of the DVD. Sometimes the movie would stall too long on one point then rush past another point.<br /><br />Then there was the main antagonist in the movie. I wished there was more history shown of her and more development of her character.<br /><br />I guess the book goes into these things into detail. But the movie should have covered these main points standing on its own.<br /><br />But, all things considered, the movie was very good. I gave it one less star due to my criticisms mentioned. The final scenes were emotionally well played. In fact, Saoirse Ronan does a great job physically acting one person and voice acting the other person.<br /><br />You'll like this movie.

B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This movie was genuinely disappointing. I had heard extremely mixed reviews...and unfortunately the negative was accurate. I enjoy gory movies, scary, corny, violent, ominous, etc...this took all the fun out of gore. The one scene that made me squerm was in the red band trailer, the movie was atrociously acted, maybe ten minutes overall was presented well. No one had any emotion. The editing and in some cases cinematography were hands down the stars in the film, and the best scene is two seconds after the credits. Tell me, would you react at all...AT ALL if you were cutting your own arm off with an electric turkey slicer? You would?!? I thought so. Apparently the director of the evil dead disagrees. If the movie held on to any of its low budget big brothers soul the bad acting wouldn't bother me. But it didn't. It wanted to be serious. It failed.

B00CA3C1N4|4.0|This is a fun entry into the genre, with appealing graphics and sound.  It starts up somewhat easy, which is good because the learning curve is steeper than expected. After you get the hang of the basics, you'll find yourself winning pretty easily.  But increasing the difficulty even one notch changes things dramatically!  I am currently getting my butt beat playing on normal, back to easy for me!

B008602KQI|5.0|I love the movie and the book.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.  They are great and totally enjoyable.
0385340990|5.0|War stories are usually a difficult read, involving too much horror.  These people experienced the horror of war too, but the author gets the message across without wallowing in it.  And balances it with humor.  Worth reading.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed it.  Wish it had more levels to it then what it has.  It was a downer to come to the end after only 10 floors.  Not even a skyscraper..
B00003CXB2|5.0|'They don't make them like this any more.'<br />Perfectly cast and beautifully photographed, this should be part of everyone's library.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|Loved it!!!!!! Great songs, costumes, and lots of entertainment !! A must see movie !!  The characters were funny !! There is a good story to this show!! It had sad parts but you will also laugh..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and the &#34;Kite Runner.&#34; I think this author is a brilliant writer. However, I would say of the three books by him I've read, this was my least favorite. It was interesting, and had great stories, but I found myself wanting to learn more about each story. Days after I finished the book, I would think to myself, &#34;What happened to Parwana?&#34; and then I remembered that I finished the book, and it was never revealed. :)<br /><br />It is definitely worth reading, but I found myself wanting to know more about each story.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Should have rented on RedBox for a buck.  Not worth watching - dumb, dumb, dumb.  One of those movies that should have stayed a book.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This movie was so boring that we had to shut it off because we kept falling asleep. Don't waste your time or money.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I loved this novel.  I could not put it down, and that is all I really know about what makes a good book.  I ended up buying a paperback version for my friend.  A great read for any sci fi fiction fan
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I playI LOVE THIS GAME . I play this game all the time . It is a lot of fun or gets harder the longer you play do not what after the first round the puzzles harder<br />.
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|An excellent first book by this author, with plot twists and unexpected curve balls coming at the reader from every direction. The plot is cleverly thought out and the ending leaves the door open for a sequel.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I was very entertained every time I sat down to read about such important men from such an important generation!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app. Great use for your mind. Keeps you on your toes. I recommend this highly. Keep up the good work.
1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks reads like a novel but it is a true story of medical research gone wrong.  Much like the Tuskegee airmen, a poor black woman--Henrietta Lacks--was used by science when her cells were taken without her knowledge or consent.  For reasons that remain a mystery, her cells grew in a culture and provided countless offspring that scientists used to launch a multi-million dollar industry.  However, when her still impoverished family learns, twenty years later, of their mother's cells' use and rapid growth, they are unable to let go of the way in which their mother and wife was used. A very good but very disturbing read.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love historical dramas. This one has lush imagery and dynamic characters. I can't wait for season 4 to premiere!
B003YBNRHU|3.0|I like the Doobies, when I saw this new album came out I thought it would be great to hear the new stuff (I am seeing them live at the end of the summer at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville OR) so I can sing along at the concert. Most every song sounds like something that was put out in the 70's or 80's... this is not bad, just does not sound 'fresh'.  There is no song that stands out on this album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The app is great. This is something my kids<br />and I do together. We like to see how fast we can do it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've had a sound machine by my bed for years.  When I travel I really miss it.  This does the trick when I'm on the road.  Now that my bedside machine has died, I use this regularly.<br /><br />Note: I haven't used all the biaural options.
B001HN6922|4.0|There's just part of the movie that freeze but it diesnt take that long. Well I guess you cant have a perfect one for a used one.
076115678X|5.0|I love this book and recommend it to every curly girl I meet, even if they are random strangers I strike up a conversation with.  I really like how the author does not push her products on you.  Instead, she gives guidelines for how to find a product that will help you have the best curls ever.  I've even given the book as a gift to friends.  Growing up with Shirley Temple like curls has not always be fun or easy.  Finally, as an adult, the book has helped me care for my curls so that I love them and be proud to be a curly girl.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|this is the third book I've read from Khaled Hosseini. I've enjoyed every one and look forward to the next one.
B008S2BZ10|4.0|Before he was busy rehashing the same old colonialist story in the guise of giant, blue Smurfs, he was making killer sci-fi like this!
B008F9E306|4.0|Solid album, good production as well as features. Definitely riding music, or better yet workout to it!<br />If you like TI, this is a good body of work.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|My husband is a huge Terminator fan and has made me one as well.  A great start to a good series.
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|A great cast that complimented one another.  A dark movie that portrayed a dark time.  They made the right decision not to try and make Ed Harris, William Fitchner, and the cast speak with a Russian accent.  It would have taken away what should already be implied.  Harris and Fitchner play together very well.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Enjoyable. So few movies are currently offered in 3D and she happens to enjoy this one so we are all happy.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This is a great, great story. I read while vacationing in Barcelona and it really brought the book alive to me! I can feel the atmosphere and imagine the characters walking the Gothic Quarters, theRamblas or Montjuic! Characters are well formed and believable. Plot is interesting. Although I was able to guess the identity of the devil early on, it didn't take away the enjoyment and satisfaction I had with this book. Highly recommended!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As usual, Dan Brown writes a spellbinding book.  The historical information woven so cleverly into the mystery keeps your interest at a peak!  The ending, although anticipated, nonetheless was very moving.
0061450162|3.0|I'm surprised I didn't like this book more. No doubt about it, some of the stories in here are very, very good, both thought provoking and imaginative. To fans of dark fantasy short stories, there are some real gems. The reason that I gave this 3 stars though is that I felt the book as a whole was unbalanced. I would read a really good story (such as Shoggoth's Old Peculiar, Murder Mysteries--which is an excellent fantasy tale of angels/satan--among others), but then the next two stories would fall flat. Some of the stories (The Goldfish Pool is one) seems to just end, rather than the story having an ending, it simply stops going. Nothing wrong  with that, but for me I do like the stories to close when I finish with them. I'll also admit that a couple of times (like the story Mouse), the &#34;twist&#34; went way over my head, perhaps if I re-read some of these stories I'd think higher of them.<br /><br />About the book: This may be the most complete collection I've ever read in the true sense of the word. Theirs everything from the usual short stories to poems to flash fiction to narrative poems, horror to fantasy to sexual stories(I didn't care a ton for these) and even a little science fiction ( Changes), and everything in between. This is a book where I can confidently say there is something for everyone, even if its only one or two pieces. I myself don't care for poems, but read them because I keep track of the books I read and don't wanna not finish a book because I have to read 5-10 pages of poetry.<br />If your like me, you'll want to know what stories are horror . I didn't find any of these particularly scary, but the best stories for horror fans will probably be: Troll Bridge (I enjoyed this one quite a bit), Snow, Glass, Apples (a dark fairy tale), The Price, and Only the End of the World again. Also Bay Wolf could be a horror story as well. It's one of the short stories structured more like a poem, and is a fantastic mystery/supernatural tale. Very Impressive.<br />As for the flash fiction stories, I don't believe a story can really be great or terrific in 1-3 pages, but they were still a lot of fun to read. Babycakes makes the reader go &#34;Holy crap!&#34;. Another flash fiction, The Daughter of Owls was pretty good.<br /><br />And yes, it's no secret by now that there is a story hidden in the introduction, and it was actually a good story.<br /><br />As for my least favorite: Tastings and One Life Furnished in Moorcock were two I didn't care for at all.<br />Also, there is a story called Changes. To be honest, I have no clue how I feel about this story. It wasn't really fun to read, but the scope that Gaiman manages in ten pages in enormous. Regardless of my not liking it, I respect the hell out of it.<br /><br />So yeah, 3 1/2 stars, some real good stories, some not so much, but that's almost every collection. I Still have no doubt that Neil Gaiman is a genius with a brilliant imagination (American Gods makes it pretty obvious), and I still have really high hopes for Fragile Things, which I'll certainly be reading in the future.e flash fiction stories, I don't believe a story can really be great or terrific in 1-3 pages, but they were still a lot of fun to read.

B00CL50LEC|4.0|First I though OMG another flippin' zombie movie, but it really wasn't.  It was more about love and striving for something better based in a teenage zombie back ground.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried more times than I'd like to count, but I also found myself smiling and giggling quite often while reading this wonderful book. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good cry, a good laugh and a good read.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love this movie.  Quick moving, descent story and lots of eye candy.  I love Downey's acerbic wit and Scarlet Johanssen's ability to kick ass. The team feeds off each other and I love a good superhero movie!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|On Facebook you get a free spin to get free items you have more than three choices on helps and at the end of the round on Facebook any flame diamonds get score for none of this on Kindle version
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and was anxiously waiting for his latest book to come out! I even pre-ordered it for my Kindle. The book wasn't long -almost a short story trying to become a novel. I couldn't believe when it ended leaving me hanging about so many parts of the story. I usually &#34;fall in love&#34; with his quirky characters and hate to have a book end, but not this time...cause it just ENDED and the characters weren't really fleshed out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it, moaning please add minecarts and minerals also saddles and the ability to switch from creative to survival and randomly spawned village. Don't have to be quick, I can wait
B002COTI64|5.0|As always RS delivers her music with a style that attacks you and you really listen. Get this if you haven't gotten it.
B009G41CG2|4.0|This game is truly one of the most fun games I have played in quite some time. The &#34; Daily Challenges&#34; add an even more exciting element.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really use the weather channel app a lot<br />t because I live on a golf course and I can check to see if there  is lightning in the area when my husband is playing and text him to seek shelter quickly.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This was a great game never thought it would be good but the game is great just gr<br />eat but it was really fun. I had a fantastic experience loved it and very happy
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Saw this for the first time and I thought the movie was excellent. Best I've seen in a while. Ang Lee did an outstanding job. The Visual and Audio was excellent as well.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray 3D combo set, you have to get the 3D set if you want more special features. All are in 3D on disc 1. Disc 2 is the 2D blu-ray with special features. Disc 3 is a DVD/Digital Copy.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Good animated movie. Classic western plot with some unusual twists. Great cast of voices. It was fun trying to figure out who was the voice for each character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I look forward to playing it every nite before retireing or when I walk by my computer and can't resist.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent product delivered as promised, on time.  I am very satisfied with the product and service and recommend this vendor to others.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|So nice and small, soft and great for little hands. Will see how it holds up in a few months.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I needed something to fill the void after finishing A Dance with Dragons. Hugh Howey does not disappoint. Immediately read Shift after this and am very much looking forward to Dust.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think its cool cause it has very good animation and that its a cool app to play. my horse is very awesome.
0007447868|5.0|Bought this used so that I could literally cut it up into chapters for portablility and to keep my wife from reading to far ahead of me.  4th book in the series, so you need to read the other three first.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Without a doubt Hansel & Gretel is cliched and a bit over the top,but in every good way imaginable.  The performances are fun and each role seems perfectly cast here. The atmosphere is dark and brooding with striking visuals to boot. I was actually surprised with how well this film looked and I would even argue on a purely visual level Hansel & Gretel stands pound for pound with heavy weights such as the Hobbit. Without a doubt this movie packs in a well balanced formula of horror and fantasy and it does it seemlessly with enough action and gore for good measure. Heads are blown off,a giant troll smashes human bodies without remorse,the witches show no mercy here and the movie does offer some shock value as well.<br />With all that said,Hansel & Gretel is one of those movies you can watch and quickly forget about afterwords (Think 2004's  Van Helsing with R rated bent to it). For all it's gorgeous and horrendous sights theirs nothing here that really sticks with you when its all said and done. It's serves it purpose and then lets you move on.<br /><br />3D: Wow! I was really,happily surprised here. The opening credits are amazing and the movie as a whole packs enough 3D depth and pop out effect to warrant a repeat viewing for the 3D alone. It definitely adds to the overall experience and is a keeper in my 3D library.<br /><br />In conclusion watch it for all the fun it is but keep it for the 3D.
B009WUBERW|4.0|When you walk into a dive bar, you don't expect Dom Perignon. They push for emotions and sentiment, they want you to care about the character. What you get is a good action movie, and acting that is par for the actors involved
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I have many,many,found memories of watching the original Wizard Of Oz growing up at my grandmothers house. I loved the music,wanted to be the Tin Man,and was terrified of the Wicked Witch. When I first heard the news a prequel to the original Oz movie was coming I was actually in the process of doodling a picture of the scarecrow!<br />coincidence?<br /><br />The last real Oz movie we had seen was Return To Oz which wasn't bad in its own way but it certainly didn't compare to the 1939 film.<br />So how does Oz the Great And Powerful standup to the original?<br /><br />First and foremost their,at least to me can only be one Wizard Of Oz. It was a product of its time and it can't be recreated,but wow,just simply wow. Sam Raimi and company really found the right balance here. This film pays a great amount of homage to the original but makes it \\"modern\\" enough for a new audience as well. It doesn't ever compete with the original,it instead builds from it. The characters are all great as well,my favorite being China Girl.<br />My only real gripe with the film is that I felt it started to drag a little towards its conclusion. I  simply felt their was no real buildup to the finale. This isn't a knock at the finale itself (which was great).<br /><br />3D: Simply stunning. Not just the 3D either. The visuals as a whole are,for lack of a better word,gushing. From colorfully bright flowers and birds popping out of the screen,to graveyards covered in creeping fog,to small town black and white Kansas, Oz has many amazing sights to behold and they're all sure to knock you out with the biggest grin you'll ever have on your face. Oz doesn't just focus on the major details either. Their was small attention to detail that just amazed me as well. Something as simple as a waterfall flowing in the background. This will without a doubt,be a keeper in your 3D collection.<br /><br />In conclusion, Oz The Great & Powerful is as visually stunning as Avatar on all fronts with enough heart toreally make it a great movie. Just like the Wizard himself this film is charming and perhaps at times not sure of itself but that's just part of the Wizards grand and epic show.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This thing is sturdy and has plenty of room for a camera and lenses. I use it to carry my Nikon D600, a few lenses, extra batteries, filters, and chargers - and there is still room for more... in the main section.<br /><br />My only real issue with this bag is, that although there is plenty of room for all the camera gear, the outside pocket is barely large enough to hold my iPad. I wish it was a touch larger so I could bring my laptop as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its so cool! hay u should. really get this game yes it has horses drur and its really fun to play I played it on the plane to Norway and in Norway and back
0307887448|5.0|A friend warned me to make sure I had plenty of free time before I started this book - and he couldn't have been more write. This is one of those book where you just have to know what happens next and the pacing is just right so that you never get bored.
B008NN8IVY|5.0|We gave this to our great-grandson for his 8th birthday.  I have never seen a happier kid.  As soon as the party was over he put it together and enjoyed every minute of putting it together and then playing with it.  Made him work on his reading skills, following directions and then his imagination after it was put together.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me with Amazon's efficiency in getting the product to our door.  Thank you so much.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|If you love the wizard of oz, you will love this movie because it shows how it all begin and how all of the characters developed.  Excellent cast with Mila from the 70's show.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies so I can see it over and over again with no problem at all.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Fascinating look at the experience of race in America(h) for an African who doesn't identify or feel \\"Black\\" until she comes to live and attend university in the U.S. from Nigeria.  This book is insightful on cross-cultural race and gender on a universal level, as well as on race and the racism specific to the U.S.  \\"Americanah\\" is well written, with some breathtakingly quotable passages. Her observations of class differences and attitudes between Nigerians and U.S. Americans can be somewhat contradictory, since she doesn't seem to see or realize some of the glaring similarities Nigerians and U.S. Americans share in terms of their obsessions with upward mobility and materialism.  But her insights here are also quite funny and profound at times.  Highly readable, delightful, and enjoyable, as well as rendering a rather shocking look (for white people) at the experience of race and racism in our white dominant society.  After hearing Ms. Adichie interviewed on PBS' \\"Fresh Air\\", I immediately downloaded this book and couldn't put it down until I read the last page!  I loved her writing so much that I then downloaded and read all of her books! They were excellent! Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait until season four, they just get better every season! Highly recommended if you are looking for a new series to watch.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoy this show. It seems smart and witty. The humor is quick and relentless. Each character is well developed
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Im only halfway through but since the books usually end on a high I have no reason to expect that I will like it less when finished.<br /><br />Some very interesting plot developments. Some of them even had me guessing what was actually going on so for the first time I chose to read all the chapters concerning one of the characters I was most intrigued about and my guesses turned out more or less correct but didnt guess the ending cliffhanger...but not saying who this was....but somehow I suspect most of the characters (if they survive) will have a cliffhanger type ending :-)
B00847KFDS|5.0|Being about the same age as John; growing up with CCR; and especially since he was a family friend, I can't help but love love love this album.  It is especially great because both of his boys are performing on this album, too.<br /><br />Love it, John.........ready for another one like it ANY day now!!<br /><br />Sandi
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I choose anything that Rutherfurd writes. He is of the Michener genre' and can start a story at the beginning of time and have you fascinated within 3 ages. Authentic history, wonderful stories that bring the ages to life and a cast of characters that you would like to meet in person. His novels are long but if you want fulfillment at the ending of a book, this guy is for you.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Kept me entertained! Didn't lose interest at all. I totally recommend this movie! I will be buying Jack the Giant Slayer!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this is simply pornography and I can't think of one redeeming thing about it. Save your money and read something worthy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Possible spoilers!!<br /><br />The last book in the Hunger Games Trilogy has a terrific twist keeping the action and suspense of the book series at an all time high - for this reason Mockingjay is a must-read.  Ms. Collins, the ending was a little lame, it sped through several years without providing much detail, or really exploring the reasons why she made the final love choice she did and how the future came about.  It almost seemed like you had had enough and were done with the series and just wanted it to be over.  Pity really, as it almost could have warranted another book, or at least a few more chapters to really wrap it up and give it a climactic ending.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the series is definitely worth a read - a truly unique concept, riveting!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I really liked this remake.  Great job paying homage to the original. Just enough twists to make this one stand by itself.  Hail to the king, baby.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I was warned about season three losing some of the electricity that developed between Castle and Beckett. So far I've not seen it so I'm still a happy fella. I am fascinated by Molly Quinn,Alexis. What a wonderful actress. I love watching her facial expressions when she comes up against Castles latest issue. Still loving the show!
085720873X|5.0|This was the last book by Vince Flynn.....I have all his books & felt so bad about his passing.  He was a wonderful author as a very kind man.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|In my review of Season I, I mentioned stumbling on to the Castle series and getting hooked ( I just noticed I say &#34;getting hooked&#34; a lot). I'm afraid the &#34;hook&#34; has been set. I had to have Season 2. Hard to believe the stories could get better. I like the way the stories start with the dicovery of a crime, the involvement of Castle, the pieces start to take shape, there is no question who's guilty and that's where most TV shows would end. But there always seems to be one more twist you didn't see coming and you are actually pleased to find you were wrong about who's guilty.<br />All this is woven with Castle's family life, love? life, Beckett's background stories. A total pleasure. If your wondering if it's for you, try Season I and plan on Season 2
B002S43V3Y|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Every time I watch it I see something I missed before.  The music is classic Cat Stevens and the messages about living life to the fullest is priceless.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Did you ever stumble on to a show and find yourself caught up in it to the point it becomes an obsession? I &#34;stumbled&#34; on to a TV episode of Castle, mid season, and was hooked. I looked it up on the internet and found I was not the only one. I called my son to ask if he had ever heard of Castle . It turns out he had just bought Season I on DVD. After one episode I contacted Amazon and ,rush mail, sent for my own copy. Hooked! I sat straight thru the three discs non stop. The six main characters work so perfectly off each other  I can't believe I never heard of it before. Now the wife is a fan,too.<br />If your debating about buying.......do it. You will only regret you don't have the next seasons offering !
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Most all (sane) Americans have a distrustful attitude towards the autocratic regime of No. Korea; this book brings it into focus on a very personal level.  That 200,000+ persons, let alone one person, can be &#34;bred in captivity&#34; like stock animals to live out their lives as slave workers until they die, defies description.  But this book does just that.  Yet, the human spirit to be free is demonstrated by the actions of one person in escaping this living hell; an act that each person living in freedom should take to heart and appreciate.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I looked all over for a good price for this movie and  I am so glad that I found it here. If you are looking for a great movie this one is it! It puts a whole new spin on the classic Cinderella story that any adult would appreciate.
0770433782|5.0|If you're a fan of the website, then you'll be a fan of the book.  Simply beautiful pictures and adorable ideas.  My fiancee and I went through the whole thing the day I got it and got inspired by quite a few ideas/themes.  And after the wedding it'll still be a beautiful coffee table book.
0071390111|5.0|Very good book, simple language to explain difficult topics. Takes all the topcs importants in neuroscience and more. Really recommend it.
0061950726|4.0|I just finish this book, it sure has a lot of heart tugging life happenings. There is a parallel between two lives, one near the end in her nineties and the other aging out of the system at seventeen. Life and circumstance bring them together.<br />The older lady was an immigrant from Ireland, she ends up loosing her family, and ends up on the Orphan Train. I enjoy reading stories about this period in this country. I am sure the children were frightened, heading to the unknown. Some loosing their parents, and now heading to loving homes?? Some were abused, and exploited.<br />This story also tells of modern times child placement services, and comparisons with the orphan train. We also with the help of modern time conveniences help the elderly orphan train survivor find some information for closure. This is an in depth look at her life.<br />I found myself pulled into this story, and kept hoping for the best. At times things looked better, but she sure had a very hard life. Loved that we were able to find out about some of the other children on the train and what happened to them.<br />In the end I really wanted more answers, what happened to the modern day orphan?? I know how I wanted it to end, and so I guess it will end that way for me. All in all this became a very quick and enjoyable read.<br /><br />I received this book from the Net Galley Program, and was not required to give a positive review.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|Prior to getting pregnant I worked out regularly (4-5 times per week), recently ran a half marathon and consider myself to be an advanced exerciser. However because of some early complications in my pregnancy, I was unable to continue running or my normal level of cardio. Most of the pregnancy workouts I found did not seem intense enough, I was looking for a pregnancy workout that was challenging enough to keep me at from losing too much conditioning during my pregnancy. Erin O'Brien's prenatal fitness fix was just what I was looking for. Erin is a personal trainer and is in her third trimester during the workout. She takes you through a series of low impact moves that keep your heart rate elevated enough to get a cardio workout and break a good sweat but without pushing it too much. She also includes toning exercises specifically targeted at your pelvic girdle and buttocks to help prepare your body for labor. I used this video 2-3 times per week and also walked 2-3 miles a few times per week up until I gave birth. I really felt this helped to limit my weight gain and helped make my labor easier. As some of the previous reviewers mentioned, the DVD is filmed in her home and the production isn't great, it almost has a home-made feel to it. Plus the background music is kind of strange. But these things never bothered me because the actual workout itself was enjoyable and worth it. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a challenging pregnancy workout!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am new and often feel unclear on using different areas and getting simple instructions seems far too complicated. Where does one find FaceBook for Dummies?
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Definitely a Brit-style film. Excellent graphics, good adaptation of the traditional story line, and an un-British like happy ending. Good Family night entertainment.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I have not seen or used any competative app but think this technology is a great thing to have. It adds a whole new dimension to listening to music.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was very pleased with the purchase of this CD and look forward to purchasing many more of Susan's CDs.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Pacific Rim:<br /><br />We have here a film that took my breath away. Awe inspiring. Those type of comments are typical of summer films, but I can assure you, this time, every word is earned. Without spoiling anything not shown in the trailers, we have a world (created with fantastic ease and nuance by director Guillermo Del Toro) that is under seige by massive, dimensional beasts refered to as Kaiju. The human race, up against the ropes, creates the ultimate weapon: the jaegers, massive, mechanical robots to beat the beasts back into their abyss. That's a very short summary, but the general story of the film is there. This film, from begining to end, is a gonzo spectale of epic proportions. The humans battle back against these skyscraper type beasts, massive hits that, as the viewers, we feel. Blue blood and acid sprays from the creatures with every hit, as the Kaiju rips and tear the Jaegers apart. We watch battle after battle against the Kaiju and the jaegers, and this is the best part of the film bar none. I spent more than a majority of the film bouncing in my seat, hanging on edge as these massive beings battle. You feel a naive sense of wonderment, and that is the film's triumph. Once again, awe inspiring. If the fights are the strongest part, then the characters are probably the weakest. Not that they are bad, the performances are strong, but the fights sometimes go over the development of our love story. But, likeable, if simple characters, are still good enough to like, and help you root for them as they pilot the jaegers, and watch from the side lines. One final note, the score of the film works well, and adds to the sense of doom and triumph throughout. I will be buying the soundtrack.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The fights are AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. The pinnacle of summer film spectacle.<br />The designs of the Kaiju's are amazing, with Del Toro's touch evident.<br />Decent performances.<br />Great score<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cliche dialouge.<br />Weak character development.<br /><br />I give Pacific Rim 4 out of 5 stars.<br />Hope this review helps!
074356619X|3.0|I was somewhat pleased with my purchase since my Daughter and others had recommended it, but I find it very difficult to follow and understand for myself.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game I love the graphics and the gameplay....I.just wish they had free diamonds and gear..... don't you agree...I don't know how to finish this review
0452289963|3.0|I found this book very difficult to understand even after watching Mr. Tolle's on Oprah and different people coming through on Skype.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Much better than watching American story lines.  Story line is great without being &#34;over the top&#34; as most American shows have become.
B0086700CM|1.0|This was a waiste of space on my device! I think a kid my liike it; but it's not for me!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was well and hooked by Season 3 and the season did not disappoint. The addition of new characters and the exit of a few too kept things interesting. I was just so sorry it ended. I can't wait for Season 4!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great series!  I was a little disappointed in the season fanale; but would watch it all over again!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|A story with many facets... written in an unusual way. A little hard to follow at times but still worth the read.
0375869026|4.0|Wonderful book. A- rating.  This good and slow reader read this work in two days.  This is a delightful story concerning a boy who demonstrates courage, good humor, and humility amidst facing good and difficult life challenges.<br /><br />Why the A-? Profanity is used in writing this work, fortunately profanity use is minimal.  This critique writer has not ever heard a person uttering profanity indicating being uplifted or uplifting fellow human beings following this profanity use.  Profanity use adversely affects writer credibility, writing subject humanity, and reader enthusiasm and support.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Puzzling experiences traveling through rooms, looking for clues and solving them. Engaging and making you wish there were more rooms.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching because season 3 just started on TV and I wanted a new show to watch and I was hooked after the first episode! I watched the entire season in 3 days.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Fun rpg with one flaw. It crashes  a lot. I am playing it on the kindle fire HD and game play is smooth then I get a blank screen and I have to shut off my kindle to get anything to respond. I went ahead with 5 stars because the game is good and worth the $2 price. With a fix it will be perfect. The story is cute and there is a lot of really funny (sick humor) dialog. Controls are really easy to get use to and smooth. I recommend this game to anyone that is a final fantasy fan. Good game just fix that one glitch and it is even better. I recommend saving extremely often to keep from having to redo any of the progress if you have the same problem. ;)
B000FCKIFU|3.0|I found this book unfolding in such a slow manner that I almost put it down.  I understand the need to establish background and characters, but it moved so slowly I began to speed read.  I stuck with it and I'm glad I did because I truly enjoyed it in the end.  I don't think I will read the rest of the Camel Cub series though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great improvement to the previous game. the in game perm's are much better. a few bugs they need to work out but overall a good improvement.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy watching Downton Abbey. I love the scenery, characters and pace of this series. Cannot wait until next season.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Gameloft really has outdone themselves with this! A fantastic game. Although it takes up alot of space and lags up my kindle, I give it 7 out of 5 stars!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Just not enough holding my attention here. Lots of action.<br />lots of characters but just not enough zing for me.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I love all these movies. I love how they tied in to the Avengers. I need six more words to say I liked this movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Love this tool. It works really well and provides a lot of information.  It is also easy to use and navigate.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this my second favorite game next to subway surfer  then temple run 2 awesome 5 thumbs up  even my nieces love it but some times my screen feezer wen i play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very realistic. Love the graphics on the game. I can't put it down. Way too in love with the game already.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Love this timeless book.  A glimpse into a life in the country side with interesting characters.  Can be read, then put down for awhile and then picked up again.  Perfect summer read or read by the fireplace.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Its so good that I cant stop listening to it. They've developed sort of an idie rock sound that is similar to so many other groups but really sets itself apart. I love every song on this album. Mark fosters voice is like silky smooth butter  just sweet! A bit of funk, a dash of harmony and sweet electronic sound gives you foster the people. Definitely more than just the sum of its parts.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|Very captivating, an indication of how dangerous such a mission was undertaken<br />And the amount of training & sacrifice these men have to go through to<br />Fulfil  such a mission, with there own lives at stake. I would rate this a four<br />Star.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game l play it a lot you should get it you can buy dinosaur with your coins you get from the game this game rocks
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just as good as the first two seasons. Really enjoyed it on my Kindle hd ,could watch it as time allowed..........&#34;my time&#34;
B008PU8SR4|5.0|This was a most remarkable book. With great consistency, it gave us an amazing window into the life and way of dealing with the world , of a brilliant but autistic child. Attending a school for children with &#34;special needs.&#34;it demonstrated how he could be mathematically and scientifically brilliant, while lacking, almost all signs of human qualities of love, or even affection. Also , how he could harness his intellect to solve real life problems in creative ways. Along the way, it illustrated how, in spite of all the problems parenting such a misfit presented, he managed to inspire respect and evn love in those parents. To write of the bizarre twists and turns of his story would spoil the book for a potential reader. I can only say &#34;Don't miss it!&#34;
B00BW5K5DO|1.0|It won't let me past the menu on my Motorola Atrix 2. It keeps just resetting itself and goes back to the menu. Fix please.
B001IF277K|5.0|My Xperia X10 phone was giving me a lot of problems. Sudden shut downs, freezes, could not talk to any one for more than 30 seconds before it would shut down even with a full charge!!<br /><br />I was ready to throw the phone away until a friend of mine suggested to try a new battery.<br /><br />Turns out he was right!<br /><br />This new battery solved ALL of the issues I was having with my cell phone. My phone works as it did when I first took it out of the box brand new.<br /><br />Great replacement battery!!
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I loved 4 songs, liked 2 more & was unimpressed with the others. Would recommend to buy individual songs rather than full CD unless, like myself, you are a collector
B000P0J09M|1.0|\\"Goodfellas\\" is one of Martin Scorses' absolute BEST films ever. Nothing is a bigger slap in the face than to have it presented on a disc that STOPS in the middle of the film so you can flip it over and watch the second half !!<br /><br />Sooo dissappointed.<br /><br />I have got to find a single sided version of this brilliant film.<br /><br />XXX<br />MRW
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Seems like not a lot of effort was put into this movie. I am a collector so it fits well for me but, if you are looking for something comparable to the original Oz, you would be disappointed
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I think maybe there were places that Townshend might have lingered a bit more but overall he touched on every area of his life. I also appreciated how he remembers that real people would not only buy the book but read it too. I give it an 8.
B000062X90|5.0|Great double guitar work from the original 2 guitar attack band. Musicianship is flawless & songwriting was excellent. The CD will replace a very well used LP
0060555661|5.0|A new and very interesting approach to a complex subject.  Enjoyed the new learning approach to a fascinating presentation of what can be a complex learning procedure.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|A good storyline that fits around the original. Would recommend to all Oz fans, young or old. Acting could have been better (Oz)
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's like a western with a sci-fi twist. Pretty funny, with decent acting. After I finished watching it I wished there had been more to the series. I'd recommend this to people who like sci-fi, action, comedy with a little bit of drama mixed in some of the episodes.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Good song lyrics. Playing at times very Thin Lizzy like. Future looks bright for this band. The Lizzy influence comes through, pleasantly
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I almost put this book down I was so frustrated with it.  The only thing it has going for it is that the author successfully writes in six different styles, all accurate to the time period the stories are set in.  However, I feel that it is poorly written and poorly executed.  The idea of splitting the six stories in half and having them &#34;fold in on each other&#34; sounded clever when it was explained to me, but reading it was a different matter entirely.  Since the stories were split up I lost interest in the characters and had a hard time remembering who was who when I got back to the second half of the stories.  Many of the characters are stupid or unsympathetic.  Also, the whole idea of reincarnation, which is supposed to drive this book, really fails in the stories.  The Warner Brothers site claims that the book/movie &#34;explores how the actions and consequences of individual lives impact one another throughout the past, the present and the future.&#34;  But, the characters do not impact the lives of their future reincarnations at all.  They learn absolutely nothing from their past experiences.  Also, at one point  near the end of the novel the author flat out explains his title to the reader, even though it was already abundantly obvious (to anyone with a brain) why he named it Cloud Atlas.  If you have to explain the title of the novel within the novel you have failed.  If you have to outright ask your reader whether your title is &#34;revolutionary or gimmicky&#34; the answer is already pretty obvious.
B00CFA222M|4.0|The storyline & acting were a bit hokey but, all in all, I liked the movie. It was entertaining & the Giants were my favorite characters
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I tend to love young adult novels more than almost any other genre.  I would definitely recommend the Hunger Games to young (but not too young) readers.  The movie adaptation was beautiful and had great casting.  I absolutely love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss.
B000002HMH|4.0|i like all the songs except these:<br />2x4<br />Cure<br />thorn within<br />the outlaw torn<br /><br />these songs really kill the mood for me.<br /><br />as for all the hate this cd gets. i can see why. but i think the black album and load are great cds anyway. don't think i am some poser though. i think their best records are kill em all,ride the lightning, master of puppets and my favorite of all ..and justice for all.<br /><br />but i am not so narrow minded that i can not appreciate these songs.<br /><br />i will say one thing that bugs me about load. kirk hammetts solos suck. they are short and nothing fancy at all. sometimes i cant believe its him. the same beast that played all those solos in the past.
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King is full of surprises as usual. Keeps your interest.  Carni details are fun. Ennoyed the interaction between the boy and thw main character.
B000002HRE|2.0|on load i found a lot of songs i really really enjoyed. but on here they are all more less the same and nothing made me say wow.<br />very average imo.<br /><br />the production is the same as load. the sound of the guitars and drums all sound like load part 2. even kirk hammetts boring weak solos that are just like load also.<br /><br />i recommend load instead of reload. this is the kind of album you only need to hear once then forget it.
1400082773|4.0|This book arrived promptly. I am half way done reading it even though I've had it for over a month. It starts of interesting, when Obama retells his childhood, but it can move slowly at times. I would recommend it, it has given me an interesting insight into our president.
B005544V6A|4.0|Great show, very entertaining.I wasn't sure about another lawyer type show, but this one does not disappoint. Give it a try.
B000002KKC|5.0|This is an excellent Fleetwood Mac CD. It is one of their best. I has a mixture of slower and quicker hits. It shows the diversity of their talent. I would highly recommend this CD! Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie are all showcased in this CD.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is an excellent movie! It has an excellent moral, and an excellent surprise ending.<br /><br />I recommend it for men and women, although you might want to watch the age of children viewing this show. There are a few brutal scenes in the movie (one depicting a gang rape of Tim Robbins' character) that are important to the story to show how awful life really is in prison; but they're not appropriate for younger children.<br /><br />Adults, enjoy the story of friendship, lies, and the redemption of an innocent man.
B00190KZUU|5.0|I've seen this before and I liked it then too. Very well written, directed and acted. Well worth a couple hours. Very nice. I highly recommend this movie.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you have not seen at least one episode of The Big Bang Theory, you must be living under a rock. :-)<br /><br />This show is funny, friendly, and yet still has a biting sarcasm all its own. The interaction between the friends and eventual girlfriends  is filled with hysterical social and emotional blunders as they struggle to understand each other, the world, and their place in it.<br /><br />Some might find it shocking to note the character growth within the series. Trust me, it's there. :-) But as long as the humor is there, this group will be a television mainstay!! Enjoy the reign of the nerds!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. The music is full of mystery! I could play it every second of everyday. What really is great is that for every level you meet new people and you get to explore more rooms.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a great spy movie! Helen Mirren is wonderful (and dangerous), and John Malkovich is hysterical as the slightly-off-his-rocker explosives expert whose spy past has scrambled a few brain cells! :-)<br /><br />This movie reminds you that even if you're retired, you're still dangerous. It's a great ride!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE the minions. And to be able to receive this for free is a blessing. I can't wait until the second movie is out. [[ASIN:B00DJFIMW6 Despicable Me: Minion Rush]]
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This is a real WOW movie that came out around the time &#34;The Prestige&#34; was released. The latter movie was the bigger hit, eclipsing what (for me) is a much better story.<br /><br />I can't tell you much because I don't want to spoil it for you. Give this one a shot. It's worth the purchase price alone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When i first got this game i was a little confused, as to where everything wad and how to train the horse, but eventually i got the hang of it. This is a GREAT game. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!! Plus the animation is really good. The horses seem so lifelike, i can picture myself in the stable with them.GET THIS GAME!!!! :)
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I admit it. I never thought the new Star Trek would be able to win me over, but half way through the movie I knew I was hooked on this incarnation of the franchise.<br /><br />So, if you've had your doubts, set them aside and watch a great action movie!
0374275637|5.0|I attended to a conference about behavioural economics that got me interested, then decided to buy this book. It is really interesting and the learning is really beyond economics or marketing, it really makes you think about how we function everyday... System 1 and system 2 concept is simply fascinating!

B004HWYTP4|3.0|Totally unrealistic and fun.<br /><br />A lot of money spent to stimulate an audience.<br /><br />Worth the time to watch, but not much more.
B007FC3AAI|2.0|While there were component I liked about the movie, overall things drug on. I like the new an more powerful Jacob, and I'm still a sucker for Bella and Edward, but Stephanie Meyer went in a weird direction.  Of course, if you've seen the other earlier movies, you need to see the two last movies. I just had to know how it ended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so hooked on this.  Had heard everyone talking about it, had to see for myself.  They were right.,  I can't wait for the next episode!
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Odessa is a masterful collection of pre-dance/disco BeeGees. You probably won't remember any of these tunes from the radio, but don't let that fool you. The Bees experiment with different sounds on this disc.<br /><br />For instance, the title track is an epic story-song, and Seven Seas Symphony is a breath-taking symphony-esque instrumental. Black Diamond is a metaphor filled broken-heart love song, the pain emphasized by Robin's vibrato.<br /><br />The Sound of Love is a breathy, pain-filled song about loneliness, emphasized by Barry gentle, sad voice.<br /><br />Just Give Your Best to Your Friends is a fun country-esque song about life's lessons in dealing with deal; hence, just give your best to your friends.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this amazing disc. If you are wavering at all about purchasing it, please buy it. You'll not regret it!
B009MJU9RE|5.0|Nice quality product, paint detail is nicely done and item feels sturdy and very durable. Very happy with the purchase.

B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings.  Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim.  What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships.  While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.<br /><br />Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities.  To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots.  But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers.  While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories.  Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past.  As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.<br /><br />While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichéd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films likeThe Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end.<br /><br />These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic.  Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious.  Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline.  Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, de Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them.<br /><br />Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus).  His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises.  Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.<br /><br />Production credits are outstanding on all facets.  Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating.  Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.<br /><br />If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided.  It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans  (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish).  Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare.  For fans and geeks, it is nirvana.<br /><br />If you're going to make afilm about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right.  Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you!  Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Tom Cruise has pretty much reached(no pun intended)his end of his career.Jaime Fox was also just okay.Movie plot was just 'eh,iffy.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Sorry to everyone else who loved this book, but any 3 book saga that is 90 percent an expose of kinked up sexual activities between 2 people is not worth a wooden nickel. That is my story, and I am sticking with it!  I am not against sex, but page after page of the same lurid details is way out of line. I paid WAYYYY too much for this book (the other two were loaners) considering I had to skip reading myriads of pages to find the rest of the book. The other 10 percent was rather nice, but not worth the hours I spent looking for it.

B005HED08I|5.0|Amazon is the best for bringing this classic television show to Amazon Prime! I love the original Star Trek series because of how it shaped both the sci fi genre and our society. Space theatre in the future was the perfect setting for creating a world in which all races and nationalities were considered equal and working together. Written and produced at a time when our country did not have the same vision for its future. However, Star Trek made people think twice about race relations as well as other social and humanitarian problems of the late 60's. Capt Kirk was not only a decisive and fearless leader, but he was well versed in the planet Earth's classical thinkers and writers, often referring to their works for diplomatic guidance. The special effects are a little frozen in the time capsule here doing the best they could at the time; however, cell phones and automatic doors are just two of the inventions that we use on a daily basis. There are many other inventions inspired by this television show. NASA was even inspired by the show to create the Space Shuttle vehicle in which astronauts could travel into space for longer missions and reuse the same vehicles for multiple missions. My father and grandfather introduced me to Star Trek and I plan to do the same for my children so that this show can continue to live on for many generations as a reminder of our societies progress based on someone else's vision. I hope Amazon keeps this show in their library so many more people can experience it!

I have watched them back to back over the last month and am now caught up.  Season Three was just as good as the other seasons, with a few new faces and some good plot twists.  I can't wait for January to see how Season Four begins...

1594203334|5.0|Very interesting information about pedagogy and child psych.  Was very entertaining and meant to reveal diff. ideas to parenting for parents who want to help and educate children, not just raise them.  In this day in age, a lot of parents are too proud to ask for help in child development and feel threatened when someone comes out with a book with a new look at an old approach.  The book is funny, in depth and worthy of reading if you are truly interested in learning more about what children need and not just giving a child what he/she wants.  Good parenting aside, it is an entertaining book for new fashionable mommies and mothers-to-be.

B004EYT932|1.0|I thought this would be a book about previous crises. Must confess I have not finished it (at about 50%) but suspect I won't. I read the first 10% hoping it would get less complicated. I'm not a novice where financial issues are concerned but felt totally lost. Started skimming through it and got to near the 50% mark without finding anything interesting. If you like text books with lots of tables and graphs then this could be the book for you.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|A good moving, fun to watch. It will not make you cry like other kids movies do. Watch it, OK
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Art house movie this is not, but if looking for futuristic cool -- a good choice.<br /><br />I recently rented this on-demand for my tween to see with a friend. The film is rated R, but would be more appropriately rated as PG13: there is no nudity, a little swearing, and not really any gore (though lots of shooting and a little blood). The boys had never seen the film and I wasn't sure how it would hold up since so many movies have used similar story lines and action scenes since the original success of the Matrix. It was definitely must-see, as the boys were silent and open-mouthed the entire film and have talked about it nonstop since.<br /><br />I think this movie works best on you the first time you see it and is great when just taken as a fun movie experience. I've seen movies that stayed with me longer, had much more compelling story lines and had more substance...but when seeing it the first time, the Matrix is just cool. Not a movie I would feel compelled to watch repeatedly, though I'm sure my tween would agree with that. Also, it's still holding its own -- doesn't look dated and with effects that still look great.
B000UXKYWQ|3.0|This somewhat overheated film is a remake of a 1936 French film of the same title, with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the lead roles as Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria and his teenaged mistress, Baroness Marie Vetsera.  Both films depend on a great deal of theorizing and guesswork about what is usually described as a murder-suicide in the imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling outside Vienna---with Rudolph shooting his young mistress first, and then himself.<br /><br />To this day, we still don't know, and probably never will know, exactly what led to this murky scandal and its aftermath, with half of Vienna trying to come up with ways to conceal the fact that the Emperor's son and heir had blown out his brains.  The pre-1918 view was that Rudolph was genuinely in love with Marie, 17 years old to his 30, and their deaths resulted from a suicide pact tied to thwarted love.  True, Rudolph had sought permission to divorce his unsympathetic wife, Stephanie of Belgium, ostensibly to marry Marie, but we must doubt whether, after only 3 months' acquaintance, a short, dumpy, dark-haired 17-year-old could have inspired such feelings in a 30-year-old.  Most accounts today agree that he was not Marie's first lover, and that she may well have set her cap for him, but recent historians have sought other reasons for the scandal.  It has been suggested that Rudolph was flirting with opponents to Austrian rule in Hungary, who may have offered him the Hungarian throne in preference to his father, Emperor Franz Josef.  It is also theorized that Rudolph had been in unauthorized contact with French politicians who, if they won an imminent election, held out the promise of a Franco-Austrian alliance that just might have stopped World War I had it been in place in 1914.  Supposedly the collapse of the Hungarian offer and the electoral defeat of Rudolph's prospective French allies, on 2 successive days late in January 1889, left him politically isolated in Vienna and even vulnerableto charges of treason, which he felt left him with no alternative to suicide, which he committed at the end of January 1889.  (But surely if that were the case, he would not have needed to kill Marie, who could have had no part in such intrigues.)<br /><br />While production values are high as regards sets, costumes and photography, the writing and acting in this film are massivley disappointing.  Omar Sharif does a much better job proving he could handle historical romance in &#34;Dr Zhivago,&#34; and Catherine Deneuve surprisingly comes off as a cipher, colorless and seemingly lacking any reason for getting involved with the prince.  (In any case, tall, blonde and beautiful, she bears no resemblance to the real Marie Vetsera, and I can only suppose that a woman of Deneuve's beauty was cast to give some credibility to their love affair. As heir to the throne, Rudolph had his pick of the most beautiful women in Vienna, and his supposed infatuation with the teenaged Marie still defies comprehension.)  Ava Gardner's beauty, still dazzling in 1968, seems to be her sole qualification for portraying Rudolph's mother the ill-fated Empress Elisabeth, and as Franz Josef, James Mason does little more than mutter dialogue that predictably showcases him as a remote, reactionary ruler deeply critical of his son.  These are puppets, not people.<br /><br />In short, this film does nothing to clarify, let alone elucidate, the background to what amounts today to no more than a minor dynastic scandal in a vanished empire.  &#34;The Crown Prince&#34; (2010) tries again, but ends up jamming too much material into the story and, in its own way, confuses matters just as much as does &#34;Mayerling.&#34;  It should be remarked that the tale of Rudolph and Marie has also inspired a ballet and an opera.  That much dramatizing should tell us something:  the story is essentially a clothes peg on which too many garments have been hung, one after the other.  None of them fits.

0553062182|2.0|I think Aron's idea of an HSP may be accurate, but the idea isn't big enough or detailed enough to justify the book. Aron fills the space by repeating herself.<br /><br />I was hoping for more studies of actual people who have worked through disorders that come from having this temperment. Aron had very few examples of that - instead she alternates between descriptions of exceptionally happy people and exceptionally miserable ones, and her only idea about the difference between them is how good their mothers were. This is not helpful.

B005CVWWJY|4.0|I'm not a gamer really, but I've grown up in the wonderful melange of pop culture that is the core of this novel. I honestly enjoyed most of the story; I would say that it drags a little in places, but overall my attention was grabbed. There are references that are explained for the casual reader ( not everyone is familiar with l33t) but there are references that aren't explained that give a slightly informed reader a sense of knowledgeable satisfaction. Overall a fun read, one I will certainly recommend, and I wish there was more.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Bright and original... wonderful characters and personalities... innovative special effects...  lots of variety in individual episodes while working through the intricate background story of alternative worlds, mysterious terrorist groups, political machinations and so much more.<br /><br />Just finished the first season and started on the season 2 last night. I am totally hooked on the series!

1423165691|4.0|Always wanted disney sketch book and they need to make more of these. It's about 1&#34; thick and is a huge beautiful coffee table book. Pictures inside are similar to what you'd find on the cover on Amazon's illustration.<br /><br />You know what though? This is the worst part. Amazon sent me a bent book - the package was poorly protected - with the book wildly being tossed about in a too large box that had one loose bubble package in it. It did nothing.  Book shipped with corners bent.  They sent me a replacement - guess what? Packaged exactly the same corners bent.  They sent me a 3rd replacement and we're not even fighting it anymore, oh well - all books are damaged.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I would gladly recommend this series to anyone looking for a drama series. I am saddened that Larsson is no longer around to write his amazing books. I will treasure these books in my heart and mind, and be ever reminded that a person is so much more than what they are on the outside. Lisbeth Salander is my hero, not for her less than lawful actions, but for her ability to stay sane after her less than fortunate life story. Way to go Stieg.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|UPDATE: Ok guys our curiosity was answered with a Directors Cut/Unrated version of the film. With that being said, I have to upgrade this to a 4-star review. There was blood splatters and things that made it a bit more like how a zombie movie should be.<br /><br />I watched in the theater and well I liked it but i wont say I LIKED it. I saw in another review that someone wrote they seemed \\"superhuman\\" and I totally agree with that statement. I mean come on they were super-fast like faster than 28 Days/28 Weeks later fast and as in the trailer they piled up like fire ants to get over a wall. I was like \\"Ok its an interesting concept but really?\\" What I really wanna see is the orginal ending also, and a unrated or directors cut would be cool. I mean how can you have a PG-13 zombie flick? Cmon now. I actually enjoyed I Am Legend better than this one because I think the story was better, but then again I didnt read the book. And from what Ive heard the movie doesnt do the book justice, which is kind of sad. Maybe Peter Jackson should have directed it, he didnt mess up Lord Of The Rings. He would have made it a 3 1/2hr movie with an extended cut making it like 4 hours and he porbably would have covered more ground and closer to the book than what we saw. Plus he walks the line between PG-13 and R perfectly.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The author has been to hell and back financially and speaks from years and years of experience. He also gets into the current economic climate of this country and more over the world. People are now choosing themselves most likely because few have been given a choice. If they want to feed themselves and their families they have GOT to decide to choose themselves. This is a world where employers no longer care about their employees and discard them as soon as it makes financial sense. It doesn't matter if you're dedicated, show up early every day, and are superb at your craft, nobody cares these days. Those things are all just expected. So why not show the same initiative and expertise put to your own use for your own company. Stop taking a salary, regardless of how generous and take what the owners of the company you use to work for typically make? How many times have we worked for someone or some company and said, &#34;Wow I can do this ten times better than how these 'intellects' are doing it!&#34; Now's your chance and this book goes into the mindset of how to achieve just that. I highly recommend it.

This version (produced by De Laurentus and directed by David Lynch) is the first attempt to bring a portion of the Dune story to the screen.

B001NA6096|5.0|You must watch all three (before sunrise, sunset, and midnight) to appreciate of receive the gift this story gives.  It makes most other movies seem shallow and way over produced.

This is a movie that delivers without anything but a good story.

B000FC1RCI|4.0|And Then There Were None is reportedly the best-selling mystery novel of all time, and judging from the many five-star reviews here, it continues to be a favorite. So why only a four-star review from me?<br /><br />Well, to begin with, let me acknowledge that I understand the accolades. The story premise is one of the most inventive and intriguing ever constructed. A mysterious stranger invites a group of ten individuals, all with a murder they have supposedly gotten away with in their backgrounds, to an isolated island where he then begins to dispense justice by knocking them off one at a time based on a nursery rhyme (which had a very unsavory original title that gave the novel its original British title, later changed both in England and America).<br /><br />The group soon realizes that the mysterious stranger killing them is actually one of their number, but which one? As the bodies pile up and the list of suspects therefore dwindles, the drama intensifies. You can't help but be hooked.<br /><br />But here's my quibble, which is serious enough that I docked the review one star: it's just too damn perfect, too mechanical. Strict adherence to the premise overwhelms any sense of reality as the necessities of the plot require the characters to act in dumbfounding ways.<br /><br />What really are the odds that someone can bring ten people to an island and start murdering them--all in accordance with the strict requirements set down by the nursery rhyme and in that order--and keep doing it through to the end? Even after the group clues in to the fact that the nursery rhyme--which is posted in all their rooms--is the template, they do very little with it. Just as an example: the butler, after knowing that the next killing will involve \\"chopping up sticks\\" decides to...chop up sticks...by himself...in the early morning. This is no different really than the airhead teenagers in a slasher movie deciding to investigate the basement in the middle of the night (in their underwear usually if they're girls) after being told there's a killer about.<br /><br />The killer is preternaturally competent and flawless--and lucky--because the plot requires it and no other real reason. After you finish, ask yourself what are the chances that the killer actually could have physically and psychologically done these things so perfectly. Plus, that message-in-a-bottle \\"How I Did It\\" coda is pretty clunky even by Golden Age detective fiction standards that required a full explanation at the end.<br /><br />I love mysteries, but what I love most about them is how they affect interesting characters, and how those characters interact. Here, the characters are mostly stock types (the adventurer, the old military guy, the old maid, etc.) who are not very well rounded out. Christie's short chapters don't help. You only get superficial glances at each person. The plot requires them to be pretty stupid or it wouldn't work.<br /><br />Compare And Then There Were None with Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, published around the same time. Chandler's plot is not nearly so flawless (in fact, he neglects to account for at least one murder) but the characters are fascinating and the dialogue crackles. Look, I'm not telling you not to read And Then There Were None. In fact, I urge you to read it if you are a mystery fan. It is one of the most influential books in the genre ever written. And you won't be bored. But I just prefer a little more realism, fewer wires showing.rwear usually if they're girls) after being told there's a killer about.<br /><br />The killer is preternaturally competent and flawless--and lucky--because the plot requires it and no other real reason.

B008UTV43K|5.0|First off, I own this album on both CD and LP. It's so good I bought it twice.<br /><br />Diana Krall has proven her versatility as a singer by stepping beyond the framework of modern Jazz, and going back to the roots of the jazz vixen. It's incredible. End of story. I'm not sure where the claims of this not being jazz are coming from --this is old school 20's jazz a la Etta James. There's a bit of melancholy, but it's jazz, not blues.

B003WE9TU8|5.0|This book was very well written and constructed. The story line focused less on the blood and guts of the zombies themselves and delved deep into the political, social and military responses to the fall out.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|The chapter title says it all.  By far my favorite book of the five.  I have not been this interested in the characters of a saga since Tolkien.  I am a total addict and will reread.  Beautifully written as it sucks you into a world beyond emotional comparison.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I think this is Blake's best album to date.  Any fan of Blakes will enjoy this album. Who else can come up with lines like &#34;chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco spit&#34; and make it a catchy tune!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but because I enjoyed watching this show so much, I felt it deserved it. The cast of characters is from &#34;my generation&#34; so I could relate to them and their views. Also like the interesting cases. Very good lawyer show!
B002RT5SR2|4.0|The movie was a decent adaptation of the book.  The book was of course much better, but there's only so much you can do in two hours.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I loved the cast and the court cases! It's a good quality show and I hope to continue watching it.
B000YAA68C|5.0|The wife loves it - has watched more times than I can count, I've watched it once and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|There's nothing more satisfying than to follow a series and to have it finally culminate in the overarching plot that has led the series all along.  And without having to wait forever for it! One word I'd use to describe Kaleb and Sahara's relationship is tantalizing, because as 2 Psys, one with broken Silence and one determinedly Silent, their dynamics are rather different from past books. I hadn't been as captured by the intensity of two main characters as the first book, Slave to Sensation.  Reading about Kaleb experiencing passion and emotion was more absorbing than even Sasha.  As always, Nalini Singh has impressed me with her skillful writing, showing focus and balance in her world-building. Kaleb and Sahara are some of the most memorable characters Singh has written of, along with Luca and Sasha [[ASIN:0425212866 Slave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)]] in the aforementioned book as well as Elena & Raphael [[ASIN:0425226921 Angels' Blood (Guild Hunter, Book 1)]] and Dimitri & Honor [[ASIN:0425243915 Archangel's Blade (Guild Hunter)]] in the Guildhunter series. Read it!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|entertaining but not the best of Denzel's work.<br />The crash of the plane is well done,<br />The movie has a good quick pace,<br />which matters to me for a movie like this one.
B008E77AEK|5.0|I was at MS TechEd and listened to Mark talking about malware. He is one of the rare persons who can write a thrilling story about IT and who knows about every single technical detail, too. Awesome book, I like it even more than his first one.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Having watched this show during the original airing in low def OTA color TV, watching these remastered in HD on a big screen is fabulous.  I see way more detail in each scene than ever before.  If you are a Star Trek fan and have not watched for a couple of years, make time for this!
1616550414|5.0|I preordered this on day one, and did not regret it.<br />art is nice and since I'm not the biggest fan of the Zelda series, I feel like by reading this I got a better understanding of the story in Zelda.<br />I do not know how much it is now but for 20 dollars I had paid (hardcover) I am very happy with the purchase.<br />Maybe I will get another copy for my collection :)
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Not masterfully scripted and directed but I didn't feel like I wasted my money. It was light hearted and entertaining.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Interesting game with lots to do. Build your base, build units, play the campaign, battle against other players, upgrade most stuff. As you rank up, better buildings and units to train become available.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  Very responsive with interesting sound effects!  A lot of different layouts to choose from.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Takes a bit to upgrade stuff but its fun unlocking the upgrades and costumes. The minions are hilarious and there's a lot of different paths to take
1611761433|5.0|I'm a big Micael Pollan fan and really enjoyed this book. I learned a lot and found it really delightful and interesting!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. Very challenging. Very suited to a goal oriented player such as myself. A definite recommend. A great game for all ages.
1455160474|4.0|I didnt' know too much about Korea--North or South and found this book very interesting. Sad, but true and the detail was amazing!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Sylvester, Arnold, Jason, Jet, Chuck, Claude, Rulfo, etc... with lots of guns and action..  not too much of a plot though.  But, then again there never is too much of a plot.
0449808696|4.0|Interesting information and good to know about how salt and sugar and fat interact with our systems. It starts early all and is often unconcious--when and why we choose/like foods.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Unsatisfied. If this is a book about Tesla, I,be discovered nothing about him. Apart from few facts there is no portrait drawn. If this book is a guide on how to become a genius I feel no smarter
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another excellent British export! Drama, comedy, character development everything you could want in a show!  Always love to see the next episode
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|There were scenes that were memorable, it had some great ideas they just didn't work as well in the movie as they did in the trailers . . .  I would watch it again, but that is because I like to watch things more than once to see all the little things that you overlook the first time through.<br /><br />It was cute, but not up to the hype.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ive gotten really attached to the characters so I was sad for the trilogy to end. Im a sucker for a happily ever after kind of ending so I was glad to see how this one ended.
B000O599ZS|4.0|The movie ofcourse is a great movie. However, the way it is produced on the DVD does not fill the entire screen. Or atleast from top to bottom. So it was a great dissapointment to me when I had to zoom it in to fill the screen. Otherwise a great movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ive read every book in the series and this was another great one. I was so excited to finally get it but so impatient to wait on the next one!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This will always be one of the greatest movies of all time with a stellar performance by Humphrey Bogart and the very beautiful Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid and Claude Raines. Peter lorre puts forth a memorable performance all be it too short. A drama filled with suspense, political intrigue, love and romance, it will always be a must see for the entire family. This is when Hollywood was Hollywood and actors really knew how to act and make us feel that we were watching true life experiences happening right on that silver screen..<br />When over exagerated special effects or vulgar language were not needed. This Is Hollywood!
0425263908|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend and took a chance on it. Really good! I will read the rest in the series also.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|Usually I enjoy cinematic works that depict the real life tribulation families sometimes battle, but this was horrific. I am a HUGE Mark Ruffalo fan...HUGE fan...and I did somewhat enjoy his character in this movie with the exception of the ending. What the heck did I just watch? It was good acting from any angle, but the storyline as a whole-especially the ending-is just ridiculously pathetic and weak. This movie is a bummer for sure if you enjoy Ruffalos other films. Big let down for sure. I would really loved to have seen a proper ending for Marks character. There was no reconciliation or closure for any of the characters which consequently leaves it up to viewers. Give us some hope and don't make a happily ever after-because that is seldom real life-but at least bring a healthy ending with closure and hope. Holding hands in the car with the wind blowing in your face is not closure...it's cheesy and overdone. After everything the kids and Mark went thru together, it really is like a big cliche...like a big lead on which leads on to...nothing at all. You think wow, this is going to be great, he's going to form a relatuionship with his biological children. NOT. He makes a mistake (which shatters them, of course) but he recieves no forgivness. For a message that they are trying to get across of \\"acceptance\\" or atleast thats what they talk about in many interviews with the cast for the LGBT community, they sure leave little room for forgiveness and mistakes committed by others. I'm so tired of the hypocrisy from hollywood. \\"I will not tolerate your intolerance\\"...geez. If you're going to make a movie about a functional family dealing with the ups and downs of family life stop making them so contriversial and make them watchable. Get over this whole, needing to send a message status and just make entertainment. Don't we have to deal with enough of that crap in the news as it is? Movies (in my opinion, not saying this is everyones stand, this review is just me ventingbecause I love Marks realism, activism, and talent and I am let down with this particular work) should be about imagination and it should move you. It should evoke something from within you that alters your being when the film has ended. It should hold a sense of responsibility and romanticism in its entirety...movies should be joyful because there is too much crap going on in the world otherwise. Cinema isn't a time to get your political agenda across, it's a time to play and enjoy the talents and gifts of others. Man...obviously lol, I am bummed about this movie and it's clearly 1:20 a.m.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|LOVED IT!!! I wanted more levels !! My children and I played and played until we reached the last level!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Don't really know what to say except OMG this series had me reading it over and over again their love and attraction for each other is truly amazing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game ever!!! I love the minions so much and this game is just perfect for me!!! ROCK ON DESPICABLE ME!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|the deluxe II mahjong was the best one i have found so far. i would not purchase this one again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome it's great only problem I have is the nether reactor core it's a great game to express your ideas on th e go
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to play, gently timed and designed to play either long or short styles, and can be approached from a variety of strategies. Links to earn gems from my kindle don't work. Music and sound effects interesting and appropriate. Graphics are beautiful. If you want to experience significant advances and resources in the game you need to play often daily or else buy gems. Some games I pay to play are reasonable. This one can be very expensive. Sometimes the game hitches on my kindle. Has never crashed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great book. Makes you think. Beautifully written. I loved it! I never want it to end. But unfortunately, it has.
B004A8ZYZE|3.0|Great advises to start your own presentations without fear to any audience. But still needs more real examples in it.
030789701X|5.0|Had no idea it was hard back but i love it anyway. its wounderfully detailed. the best book to help be accomplish everything in skyrim. now only if i could be lucky enough to get in on the beta of elder scrolls online now that be the bomb.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love all the new Dr. Who ... can't go wrong with these!<br />shipping was fast, it came in good condition and I watched them as fast as I could.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had no idea! I had no idea how profoundly this book would affect me. Just as Cheryl delayed the ending of the saga, I delayed the ending of the book. And now I must revive it in my memory to absorb all that it offers. Profound.
B00513DGIO|5.0|This is a really book that gives quite a different perspective to the notions and the historic significance of money and debt.
B008NQYWC0|3.0|I will start by saying that I am a huge Stephen King fan. He is my equivalent of Prince of the book world. I only gave the book 3 stars because it wasn't my favorite Stephen King book, but I did enjoy it, and recommend it for an entertaining read.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love Mike and Harvey. This show has it all. It has drama, comedy, sex, backstabbers, and love. I am addicted. You have to see episode 1 of season 3.
B0093X805W|5.0|My son was hesitant to read this book because he doesn't always like to read. However, once he started, he couldn't stop!
B003FCVF6I|5.0|It begins with electromechanical amusements and pinball, and ends just before the introduction of the original Xbox. Great chapters on Atari and the arcades, very readable and I enjoyed it. My only criticism is that it's hardly an &#34;ultimate&#34; history as it barely mentions gaming on computers, only on consoles and the arcades. If you're interested in games and the history of the industry, though, you'll find a lot to enjoy and learn about in this book.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a totally entertaining movie - great action sequences without being over the top. The funny moments were laugh out loud funny. Cant wait to see the sequel!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Another classic from Alfred Hitchcock. Been many years since I frirst saw this back in the late 50's or early 60's. A really great movie with some great entertainers.
B004WR125O|1.0|This app on the receiver is just too primitive. Not worth using. I had another wifi usb adapter that I had for DirecTV that I don't use anymore, this one worked the same as the Onkyo. But I still don't use the app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film tugged at my heart strings in so many ways.  My heart yearns for men to be fathers to their sons and daughters as portrayed in this movie.  There is something there for grandparents of children who don’t have a father as well.  Very inspirational and motivational.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|this is a fun, classic movie for the whole family! i would highly recommend it. the music is wonderful-this is one of my favorite musicals...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids just love this game and would recommend it to others, they cant get enough and love the different challenge areas.
0374275637|5.0|This is a fantastic book about how the human mind works, and how it unintentionally leads to biases and errors in judgment.  Everyone should read this book; we would have a better understanding of our selves and of many of the problems that we as a species face.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The story is really good. I read the whole thing in only a few days. The characters are interesting and the character development is great. I also really liked the unique magic system.<br /><br />The only bad thing about reading this book is that the second one in the series isn't out yet.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its pretty cool you know its kind of hard so ummm yeah its epical I guess. so yeah ummmm its cool
B005544TRQ|5.0|Witty, smart, entertaining, dramatic, suspenseful, exciting, and did I say entertaining? All of these words describe this awesome show! I found this show one day while browsing the shows on Hulu.com and I must say, I'm glad that I did.  Thank you Amazon Prime when due to the USA Network, I couldn't view Season One episodes anymore on Hulu Plus. I also watched Season 2 a second time to get ready for the new season on USA Network!!
B001F0TM5I|5.0|I absolutely HATE this movie.<br />It was corny and cheesy and all around just awful...<br />HOWEVER, the only reason I bought this was because my ex could not find a copy in town.<br />It made his day, even though now I'd like to take this movie and shove it where the sun don't shine....<br />Thanks for listing it at any rate.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Acting captain's log, 23:36. Earth.<br /><br />Package quietly arrived at 13:00. As I was distracted by other events falling into play, I did not gain an opportunity to retrieve it until 13:43, well after it had maintained status in the appropriate mailbox. Upon opening the package, it was discovered that the \\"DVD sleeve\\" did not open horizontally in customary book fashion-- instead, the inner means of storage for the \\"DVD\\" slips in and out of the top and bottom efficiently. In addition to the optical disc contained within, a digital copy of the motion picture is included for convenient viewing on one's personal computer or a capable mobile device.<br /><br />The faces of myself and Starfleet Captain James Tiberius Kirk, currently indisposed in the ship's medical bay, are featured on either side of the box. Illogical, as only one side is upturned and in line of the viewer's sight at any standard point in time, but this seems to have given exorbitant amounts of pleasure to the Captain, who rather... *gleefully* rotated the package in his hands before Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy was able to relieve him of his consciousness once more.<br /><br />In summary, the package arrived efficiently and well-protected. There were no scratches or malfunctions, and no complaints can be made as to the quality, quantity, or methods of shipping for the product.<br /><br />Live long and prosper.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. But it could wait a few extra seconds after the last number is called to baub a bingo.Plus the game could use an automatic daubing feature for a few coins.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|I want my money back!  This never loaded properly.  We'd watch for a few minutes then PAUSE while it loaded.  A few more minutes then PAUSE while it loaded some more.  I watch digital content all of the time so it's not my system.  It's simply this movie.  Refund please.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Its About Time You Put The Real Game On This Appstore. Whoever Agrees Rate It One Star.Please Give Us This Game And Make It Free.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I'm still reading this book.  I heard Dan Pink speak at the SHRM annual convention in Chicago in June and was so impressed, I bought his book.  It's easy reading:  he writes so everyone can understand his concepts.  A good read for everyone in any profession.
1582701709|5.0|A well written book with testimonials but more importantly the secret everyone needs to succeed. As a Christian, it has finally sealed the biblical principles: ASK, BELIEVE, RECEIVE.  Try it!!!
B000H7J9S0|5.0|i think the transfer is so good,their sound is perfect.is so so clean this movie.is not subtitle there.is not features available.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Missed the first few seasons, now starting from the beginning. This show has it all, handsome hero, gorgeous detective, smart and beautiful daughter, dynamite mom!
B006678VWA|5.0|Great special features and an excellent movie, what more can I say?  The standard Blu-ray disc does not include the special features.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I was disappointed that they did not offer this in full screen because I do not like widescreen at all; however, the film is so captivating that I hardly notice this. Normally, I would buy the dvds new at a store because I wanted to make sure they didn't run out of the full screen versions. I was planning on waiting until this dvd was very cheap before purchasing because widescreen is not worth it for me. I believe I got a good deal when I was a Prime customer so I ordered it then.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I particularly loved the way the author alternated between the present life of the main character and her history bringing the reader up to the present moment.  I didn't want to to put the book down because I could wait to read what happened next.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I was disappointed that they did not offer this in full screen because I do not like widescreen at all; however, the film is so captivating that I hardly notice this.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show if you haven't seen it you should. It is the greatest around.and if you have 10 points for Walking Dead
B00DQQZNZW|4.0|Elysium was okay, but I thought it was rather boring and slow. Electric is much more . . . well, exactly what the title says - it's more electric for sure. Enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The strength given to a female lead is nice to see. There is basis for the rebellion....... As government becomes increasingly overbearing in our world today.
B004JM8X5E|4.0|Utterly predictable, adequately acted, but it's compelling for some reason to watch a total loner outcast be discovered as especially powerful and brilliant.  Maybe it makes loneliness feel more like a gift?
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I just love this book that I know I have to write a review. I could have read it in one sitting but my many obligations as a mom won't let me. I love the different emotions that the characters went through, emotions that each one of us felt growing up as a teenager. The awkwardness, insecurities that we had. It also shows the realities of how families/cultures/relationships/personalities can be different from one another. I love how it made me laugh one minute then cry the next minute. I can't wait to find out what's gonna happen next though I don't want the book to end. I also love the open ending and it is up to us readers to interpret the three words that Eleanor wrote in the postcard. Overall, I really enjoyed it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game,the dragons are beautiful.so much fun.totally addictive,only had it a few days,but have played it almost exclusively.I like all my games,but this is the only one I've written a review for.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I love Boardwalk Empire and movies of that era, like The Untouchables.  I'm waiting for the third season to add to this.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I rented this for my husband and grandson to watch for a movie night together. It had that weirdness and quality that they both love in a movie. Good acting, great special effects, sci-fi. It may go on my Christmas list for one of them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really awesome game! Great for people who like to be challenged.. I finished it pretty fast about 2 hours. But months'm later played again and still took me a few to finish it again.. really . Enjoyable each time.. can't wait for the room 2 to come out gonna be even better
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book was amazing. I've never before been this immersed in a story. Hopefully the author will finish his third book soon.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I'm not a huge &#34;sci-fi, fantasy&#34; fan, but this movie made me want to read the book. I didn't feel as if it was all smoke and mirrors with no plot & a lot of special effects. The effects it did contain were necessary to the story which I found entertaining, action-packed, & dramatic. There were poignant moments of loyalty, love, and heroism. This movie had it all. It had some top-notch actors and those who rated it poorly I don't think gave it a proper chance. I would find it very interesting to see where they go next with their journey.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Sequals usually leave a lot to be desired from movies and books, but this book was just as amazing as the first.<br />Thank you for these wonderful books!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So inspiring, so touching....just a great story of courage, character and love.  Examples of true human spirit,overcoming our fears and letting our hearts lead the way is the best way to live.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Great chemistry between the actors even though it is sometimes hard to understand the quick quips w/ the British accent (I am from USA).<br />Very long episodes (~90min), but always intriguing.<br />I cannot wait until season 3 is released at the end of this year.
B001LXIDVS|3.0|This movie falls in that in between slot, As one reviewer put it. The Clara character is totally useless in this movie, Since Doc is in his 70's to 80's. While Mary Steenburgen is clearly in her early 40's, Marty is reduced to a side kick in this movie. The movie opens where II left off, Marty watching the Delorean disappear in the sky.And having the postal service guy show up in the rain, giving Marty the letter from Doc in the 1800's. So now, with the help of the 1955 Doc, he finds the buried Delorean. Fixes it, and heads back to the west, to save Doc, since he got shot and killed. And the Tannen ancestor makes an appearance here too in Mad Dog Tannen, but what sets this movie apart from the other two, is the pace. And it's slooooooooow, At first. Because the fuel line on the delorean got cut, they now have to figure out a way to get the car up to 88 miles per hour. And the answer comes in the form of a train, which is plausible. And then the movie derails, it gets lost in a romance between Doc, and Clara.And like I said before, there is no chemistry there. It actually feels forced, yes it leads to Christopher Llyod's first ever on screen kiss. but it just doesn't really go anywhere, yes there's the famous Clint eastwood parody done by Marty during his gunfight with Buford. And clara all of a sudden leaves Doc, the reason never really given. But as the train is leaving, she overhears two men talking about Doc's pining over her. And so she decides to head back to town, only Marty and Doc have already left. She catches up to the train that they've hijacked, Marty already being in the car. Lets Doc stay with Clara as the car goes back to 1985, and the train goes over the unfinished bridge. Marty manages to get out of the car, just as an oncoming train runs over the car, totally destroying it. And really to be quite honest, they should have left the movie at that point, Marty picking up Jennifer and going back to the delorean to pick up the pieces. But Doc and Clara show up their kids, in a new and improved Time machine, a train. While it's a good movie, it's not as good as the other two. The jokes aren't as crisp, and the romance is forced. Like I said, not great but not bad.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yum yum yum.... GIDEON Cross is the hottest alpha male of 2013!!!!!! If your looking for one Spicy sexy read then this is the series for you. I cannot wait to see what's next for Mr. & Mrs.Cross :)
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This ap will get wheat you need to do done on ebay but it is more tedius than working on your notebook or pc.  You may find yourself accidentally touching something on the screen you did not want and you will have to wait for the unwanted page to come up before getting back to business.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|My son liked it for about 10 minutes, i found it difficult to get the ball around the maze, it falls off alot it seemed like it would be fun but its not. This is something i would recomend you find a way to try first. I left it out on a table for months and no one picked it up to try, very boring for the price it looks cool but thats it
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have never been disappointed with an Adobe product and this one continues their reputation for making quality, useful software that works well all the time.
0062255657|4.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a YA fantasy that an avid reader could consume in one sitting. I liked it: I deeply sympathize with its nearly unnamed hero, who just wants to read his books in peace and fears being asked to eat something he doesn't like when he visits other people's houses. Notice I didn't say &#34;when he visits his friends' houses&#34;; he doesn't have any friends. That is, until he and his dad go to pick up their stolen car, and he meets Lettie Hempstock. This eleven-year-old girl seems even older than her years to our seven-year-old hero, and her maternal friendship provides him with a much-needed sense of security as things spin out of control back home.<br /><br />This book felt like part of something much larger, much like C.S. Lewis's The Magician's Nephew (which really should only be read after The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, as Lewis originally intended). There's an enormous backstory, and, as our hero complains at one point, &#34;I wish you'd explain properly...You talk in mysteries all the time.&#34; The writing convincingly portrays the concerns of a seven-year-old while never ceasing to be a wiser adult's reminiscence (minus the twist at the end, which I won't spoil). It felt like the sort of story one might be assigned as an exercise in a therapy group for people who have survived childhood trauma, except of course that it's written by Neil Gaiman. It seems to be a reshaping of a painful event to give it a fantastical explanation. This worries me somewhat, as it seems to exculpate an abuser, but again, I don't want to spoil anything for you.<br /><br />In short, a troubling but worthwhile short read. I hope Gaiman writes more about the Hempstocks. Until then, get your feet wet in The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I usually don't care for this type of book.  Too many people see the light at the end of the tunnel then tell of seeing their long dead uncle.  They may be actual, true events for the writers but they usually aren't convincing.  Proof of Heaven:  A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife is a different and interesting tale and very convincing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was quite good. The buildup was very intense and really got you into the story. The problem was how quickly the story wrapped up. The ending of this book felt like the ending of that Tom cruise 'War of the World' movie. I can't say more without spoilers.....damn!!!. I hope the movie fixes some unanswered questions and fixes some unneeded problems!<br /><br />The first two books were fantastic, and this book will have you on the edge of your seat until the last 10 pages. Then everything is wrapped up....
B00AESN8XY|3.0|The game has an unusual and great premise but the game play is too limited and repetitious.  I found it fun to play for about six or seven times then just could not get myself to open it again.  I have since deleted it from my device.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that you are able to explore the rooms. If you love puzzles and figuring things out you will love this game. I just wish there were more levels. Now just have to wait for the update.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show.  Jess is charming and hilarious - a real goofy but comfortable in her goofiness.  Her roomies are the kind of guys you wish you could really meet at a bar although don't hold your breathe ladies.  This show is amazing.  I laugh out loud at every episode.
0375507256|5.0|I cant tell you anything. I dont want to ruin it!<br />Do yourself a favor and read this. Then, tell all your friends to read it.<br />Lovely, poetic, thrilling, fun and tragic- a real trip.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I don't recommend anyone get this app.  I found my Kindle Fire already did everything this app does.  Use the setting on your Kindle instead of taking the space for this app.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I love all his books but this is different from A Thousand Splendid sons & The Kite Runner. Bit more of a mystery & not quite so depressing.....
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is really good for viewing the weather at my home or anyone in my family's home.  I have family all over the western states and I can find out the weather for each area on this app.  It will also give me a weekly prediction for each of those areas as well.  I would recommend this app to anyone who is concerned about other areas of the county.  It is great.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Its okay very readable but a bit confusing. I felt that both the main  characters needed a good hard slap!!!!!!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love Noah Wyle, he seems like a great dad that loves his kids. Good special effects. Great story line, lot of aliens, just when u think u got it figured out, they change it up.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|This is an excellent DVD for the person who enjoys classical music/dance.  Arrived on time as scheduled.  Packaged well for shipment.  Enjoy very much and I can not wait for other DVDs to come out.  Thrilling and exciting, never know what will happen next on the DVD.  This helps a person to appreciate the different styles of music and dance.  rd
0156027321|5.0|This is a great story, a fantastic work of storytelling, and a perfect book for any age, the many religious and moral themes that are presented a book make a great book for any book club.
B008JFURII|5.0|\\"Red 2\\" is a superb action film that touches on the continuation of most of the characters from the first Red film. My husband and I both agreed that \\"Red 2\\" was even better than the first \\"Red.\\" However, he was undecided at first about who was his favorite character. This was because Bruce Willis and Louise Parker elegantly played a couple very much in love and playing out their relationship among various heists. Lee Byung-hun gave a marvelous performance as a gifted assassin who deep down has a good sense of right and wrong. However, my husband admitted that he enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in the role as Dr. Edward Bailey the most. This was because Hopkins gave an admirable performance as a physicist who is called upon for his talents. My favorite performances were a tie between Helen Mirren as Victoria Winters and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs. Mirren gives a splendid performance as a trained and true femme fatale who still has a heart for her fellow friends while accomplishing her duties in an efficient manner (there is a comical scene where she is portraying the queen of England). My husband also liked Mirren's performance, but more for her flirty demeanor and her elegant style while doing one of her jobs (there is a scene where she is aiming her gun in a stylish outfit and letting her boyfriend touch her feet). I enjoyed Malkovich's commendable performance as Boggs because he plays a man with the right touch of paranoia who also is a skilled mediator for his fellow colleagues/friends. There are also electrifying scenes in the movie where the characters are shown traveling to England, France, and Russia. \\"Red 2\\" is a terrific film for those who enjoyed the first \\"Red\\" movie and/or like action films. The following actors/actresses also play important parts in \\"Red 2\\": Catherine Zeta Jones as Katya, Brian Cox as Ivan Simanov, David Thewlis as The Frog, and Neal McDonough as Jack Horton.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|episodic interviews for each chapter, but not unclear. i was a little confused at the end when some characters were interviewed again. made me wonder who i'd missed.
B0001US62I|2.0|I admit that it is not always easy for me to publicly rate something two stars or less. This is only because I strongly believe in karma, which also is related to the type of reviews that a man or woman puts out publicy. I understand that diehard fans of this movie and/or those who disagree with my viewpoint may give at least one unhelpful vote, but I feel it necessary to speak about the movie. \\"Angel Heart\\" is a supernatural type of movie that touches on the nature of good versus evil. The casting of Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, Robert Deniro as Louis Cyphre, and Lisa Bonet as Epiphany Proudfoot was well done. The positives: Mickey Rourke brilliantly played a detective who goes about getting the answers to his questions in very unconventional ways. Rourke's complicated but convincing portrayal as Harry Angel reminds me of the strong complexity that he showed as a villain in Iron Man 2. Rourke also did a good job in expressing shock at some of the events in the movies, part of me also wanted to believe he had nothing to do with many of the events that transpired. Robert Deniro did an incomparable job of portraying a man who is not how he appears to be and a tricky character to pin down. Deniro's gift of portraying multiple personas reminds me of his intensity in The Bronx Tale and Stardust movies.Deniro also distinctively plays a Cyphre who convinces Harry Angel that he is truly an ally. Lisa Bonet does a notable job in portraying a woman who is doing the best that she could in going on in her life without her mother while also tending to her son. The reason why I give \\"AngelHeart\\" two stars despite the terrific acting is due to my uneasiness with the painting of the Proudfoot character as only promiscuous and mainly focused on her occult lifestyle.  There is nothing wrong with those who choose unconventional lifestyles, but I was hoping that Bonet's Proudfoot character would have been portrayed in a more positive light. Yes, she was at least wonderfully portrayedas a caring mother. However, it would have been nice if other facets of her were more frequently revealed in the movie. I felt as if the movie was unintentionally portraying that Proudfoot deserved what happened to her as a result of crude stereotypes. Maybe a remake and/or sequel could feature either Proudfoot or one of her descendants as a female of many interests who loves life and is highly spiritual. The remake and/or sequel could also feature what happened to Harry Angel and/or one of his descendants in the afterlife. I only say this because I do believe in reincarnation, and believe that a formerly evil spirit is eventually released from the darker non-physical realms if they are remorseful and are determined to spiritually evolve. However, there are some fans of horror films that may enjoy \\"AngelHeart.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a fan of science fiction, but really enjoyed these books. Great writing and story line. I am a fan of this author and will read more of his books.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" involves the journey that a young girl named Chihiro embarks on after finding her parents transformed into pigs. She also travels through an even more unusual spirit world and dealing with the witch who was responsible for what happened to her parents. \\"Spirited Away\\" reminds me of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" (which is also a good film).\\"Spirited Away\\" is a great anime movie with supernatural/spiritual themes.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|\\"The World From The Side Of The Moon\\" by Phillip Phillips contains the popular and satisfying songs that are \\"Home\\" and \\"Gone, Gone, Gone.\\" \\"Man On The Moon\\", \\"Get Up Get Down\\", and \\"So Easy\\" are among the quality songs on this collection.  I like \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" a lot because the lyrics, in a positive way, symbolize how my husband feels about me.\\"The World From The Side Of The Moon\\" by Phillip Phillips is good for those who like \\"Home\\" or adult contemporary songs.
B000003S5H|5.0|Love it!  Exactly what i thought it would be!  I want to get more of Air!  I will when i can
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this set simply because I feel Alien and all subsequent releases are top notch and have long owned them in VHS format.  Add to that the multiple options of theatrical release or \\"Director's Cut\\", the high quality of Blu-Ray and excellent sound and you having a winning set.<br /><br />The 'case' for lack of better terms could have been a bit better.  What the heck.  It's about the movies not the case.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just can't say enough about this book! Excellent narrative style. Terrific plot. It's about kids with terminal cancer and yet it's funny and sarcastic and realistic. It's also brutally sad, but without once trying too hard to wring tears from the reader. I have been a high school English teacher for 20 years, and this is one of the few books I have ever read that gets teenagers' voices exactly right. I would highly recommend this to pretty much anyone, but especially to young adults. It was such an impressive read, I will be teaching this to my students this year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Out of the 3 books, this is the best one.  But, you must also plan on also reading the 3rd book, because it wraps everything up.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book reminded me of the kind of novel I loved when I was 15. It's dramatic, its characters are all dealing with conflict - both internal and external - and it deals in the kind of historical backdrop that most of us are familiar with. But it doesn't challenge conventions, and in fact resorts often to the sort of superficial assumptions, even stereotypes about people. Many characters are defined by little more than their ethnicity. Okay, it's a book about slavery and the individuals on both sides of a typical plantation household. But the conflicts are too obvious, the resolutions simplistic, and the roles of the characters tend to be, if you'll excuse the pun, truly black and white. The white plantation-owner is wonderful and sympathetic but absent. The wife is self-medicated and ignores those in her care (including her own children). The owner's son grows up to be a one-dimensional sadist. Every white person in this novel is not just flawed but fatally flawed. The slave families? Without exception, good people struggling against The Man. In addition, Grissom has overused the alternating-narrator format in a way that becomes downright annoying; by the middle of the book, it results in a sort of &#34;look here - wait, no, look here!&#34; narrative that becomes disjointed.  What could have been an opportunity for a terrific story has been reduced to a seventh-grade historical fiction requiring little of the reader. It's Wuthering Heights meets Roots. Minus the literary skill.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This book was recommended to me two different people on different continents.<br /><br />My rating is high because the author accomplished what he set out to do: create a very gruesome, suspenseful serial killer novel. That being said, I don't like a steady diet of this \\"killer porn\\". Very professionally done and you have to admire the craft. I just don't have an overpowering urge to read the rest of Nesbo's books. I imagine it is like taking a tour of a slaughterhouse: interesting, yes, but not sure I want to do it again.<br /><br />This was my first Harry Hole novel, and it is apparently very different from the others in that it starts off aggressively and never lets up. I have been told the other books are a slow slog for the first half before things gel and begin to take off. This one is slash and burn from the start.<br /><br />In tone and character Harry Hole reminded me of \\"Wallander\\". Full disclosure, I speak here of the TV series. I've not yet read a Wallander novel and, considering how easy the TV mysteries (based on the books) were to figure out, I may never do so. Like Wallander, Hole is a brilliant, depressed loser who is great at solving crimes, but hopelessly inept at personal relationships. This seems to be a requirement for homicide detectives in Scandanavian countries.<br /><br />Nesbo lays out all the clues without giving too much away, except in one glaring instance where our brilliant detective misses something so blindingly obvious that the reader sees it immediately. Hole appears to miss it only because his oversight moves the plot along.<br /><br />Very suspenseful, but be warned again: very, very violent.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|the randomly generated maps are great... and you can easily lose from simple neglect... got to pay attention or else the AI will whip you.

B00933JL0A|5.0|I use games destress and this one does it for me. I found I couldn't put it down. It's pretty easy to get down and after a while you find yourself lost. I appreciate that I didn't have to &#34;purchase credits to build my villages. You just play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this app. it is awesome and fun! When I first got it I thought it was stupid until I started playing it. Animals and mobs(monsters). Everything is detailed and amazing. You can do whatever you want to do on this app!!!!!!! Its the best game ever!!! Worth the price for sure!!!!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A couple months ago, a friend of mine recommended this book to me. At the time, the book was not yet available on Amazon. Soon thereafter, I was excited to learn that James Altucher made a PDF version of his book \\"Choose Yourself\\" available for purchase via Bitcoin-only on his website until it was officially released on Amazon.com. I immediately sent the Bitcoins and downloaded the book to start reading.<br /><br />As I started reading, I found it difficult to pull myself away from the screen. J. Altucher has a very unique writing style that really keeps the reader engaged. Not only that, but the content is so refreshing, inspirational and -- when you least expect it -- downright hilarious.<br /><br />The core concept of the book is to simply \\"choose yourself\\" on a day to day basis by way of maintaining the four corners of your health: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. While the idea may seam simple and perhaps even obvious upon first glance, it is incredibly powerful and James does a fantastic job at articulating how to apply these principles to improve your everyday life.<br /><br />Frankly, this will be a book that I will go back to re-read over and over. Highly recommended.
0956031609|5.0|Definitely the book is better than the movie. Has more detail.  Sheetal and LIsa have outdone themselves. They have great chemistry together. Great acting. This movie is worth watching.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written story, it's a fresh Take  on the end of the world as we know it. There always seems to be a new truth to be told or a cover up to be exposed around the next corner. A very believable piece of fiction
B00DM11LV6|5.0|Necar Zadegan has outdone herself in this romantic movie! Great performances by both actresses! Movie had a plot which is unusual for movies involving gays. Will watch again for sure! Well worth it.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Great story that had me wondering why there were so many pages left if the mystery had already been solved. Glad it wasn't over.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not bad,  I liked the drama. Quick read follow the typical storylines lately I liked them. Definitely a fun read
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is my favorite movie - not really your typical movie, but this one involves domination and submission and how much power the submissive really has and gives to the dominant.  Explains how a person could like pain to relieve stress and emotions.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is simply AMAZING!!!! I couldn't put the book down! It captivated me at every page and I was reading it everywhere!
B000IZA9PI|5.0|I would highly suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie atleast once to give it a shot and you'll really enjoy it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought we would like this series. Friends talked us into watching it and we were hooked! Can't wait for the next season.
B0053TMP24|4.0|i just love this series it full of detail, adventure and and mystical creatures. and if u like the books ul love the movie. im ten and i loved both! : { ]

B000J1AGQI|5.0|A great movie well acted that showed the things we went through in this battle.  It was excellent and held, as closely as a movie can, to what went on.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This latest version has taken something I would use multiple times daily to an app I avoid.  It is now so confusing to look at and to use I rarely open it.
B005544V6A|5.0|Lawyers and their problems.  This program really does a great job with what happens with the Law.  Having a nonlawyer as one of the main players just adds to the flavor.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book was recommended by a co-worker. I enjoyed the journey and the lessons. Thought provoking the book makes you understand sometimes what you are searching for is your faith in yourself.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Having the USB charger plugged in while watching movies on my laptop ensures I won't be without strong sound during the show.  My laptop just couldn't put out enough power to my Sony headset to let me enjoy everything that was happening.  This little widget took care of that.  Highly recommended.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Creative little game, good time killer. Would recommend to other people, for something to do, if you are sitting around holding your kindle.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Nice blend of upbeat music.  A great way to relive the concert experience.  Everyone in the family likes their music--it is nice to listen together.
B00CL8DKE2|5.0|OK PSB fans, this is the album that should have followed up Very.  It is easily the BEST thing they've done since.<br />The deep bass rhythms are EXQUISITE.  Crank this album UP!  You are going to be dancing despite yourself.<br />Only throw away track is 7, it is just too frantic for my tastes, but 8 and 9 are AMAZING.  Seriously folks, this disk<br />is the best electronic dance music in many, many years!!!<br />MUST HAVE for PSB FANS.<br />AMEN, and long live the Pet Shop Boys
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Great visual game, very addictive and fun to play. Easy to navigate and easy to follow. I highly recommend it.
B008E8XV56|5.0|I've been following Mark Russinovich's technical writings and software for years now, but had missed seeing his first fictional novel set in the world of Cyber Terrorism. As a Microsoft Technical Fellow and developer of the excellent SysInternals suite, Mark is exceptionally capable of weaving his tale in this very much possible look at cyber terror. A highly recommended read.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It's unusual to see Zack G in a more serious role, and he did a great job. Also, the main character was endearing.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I wish they made it easier to progress through the game without using real money. Other than that,it is really fun; runs well; and is much better than svz1.

B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|Kept seeing a very distracting bright banner across the top of my screen, asking me to play a game, or some other advertisement... or something. Not something I wanted to see when looking for stars at night. I deleted it less than a day of trying it. NOTHING AINT FREE. I'll just pay a few bucks for a &#34;real&#34; one. One more thing... It makes me want to avoid this company for any other app. I doubt I'll try anything else from them.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|A light read, easy to put down and easy to pick up the story after a spell. A different way of telling a story through the characters writing letters to each other, refreshing and involving.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome book!! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I also recommend the book \\"Fearless\\". You will laugh and cry.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I really enjoy Joe's singing anyway, but I found this CD to be as telling as it's title.  It's &#34;Old Skool&#34; smooth, sultry, music with nice lyrics.  I enjoy listening to this CD and have done so often.  I think this is the JOE CD that will become a classic!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I can't wait to have time to play each night. It is a real challenge and I am hooked on it.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|This movie was somewhat entertaining, but I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  The storyline and relationships were very weak.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Do not like the fact that I must be connected to a internet feed to turn the bible on. Our church does not have internet and unless someone is at church with a hot spot I cannot access this app. It was my understanding that once you had downloaded an app that it was accessible on line or off. This is an amazing app when it works right. I have it on my iphone, but now prefer to use the Kindle.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun and funny I love it because it has minoions. they are so awesome and fun Yahoo and fun
B000056NX5|5.0|My favorite JCS cast. Inspired. Setting the whole thing in a modern-ish inner city was a brilliant touch. Jesus, Mary Magdalen and Judas are perfectly cast.

I've read it three or four times back to cover and certain pages dozens of times.

B000QEIORG|5.0|Overall the best, also has the bonus tracks (Love the down in the park cover). Still is. 3 more words required....
B00132S74A|5.0|As a many year fan of Ken Follett, I enjoyed Code Zero. The reader is able to easily envision the characters and plot events throughout the story. Follett's ability to explain situations and people involved in plots that contain evil at heart...is able to bring involvement to thriller and mystery readers. Without the childlike &#34;two page&#34; chapters, story folds into one's attention with steady growth. Fine writing and professional competence build a facination in the future, rather than page turning excercise.

1451629192|5.0|To read about a life stolen like this breaks my heart. I think it was very painful for her to relive some of the specifics, so some areas are a bit general over the years, but her capture and how they break those they steal is just heart wrenching.

B0086700CM|4.0|Infinite runner like any other.  Fun, but as you run for longer, your device can become bogged down, so that the game can lag and either miss a swipe or fail to lean. Definitely smoother on iOS.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Most of the read was really good, but I didn't like the ending at all. I don't know that all of the negative ratings are really fair as the book overall was good, but just had a terrible ending.
B007TML4EI|4.0|This game was interesting as FAOD, but if you've played any castle-builder, this game is more of the same.  At this price, it might be worth playing anyway.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I live this game my brothers always try to get into it so I bought a lock for my games
B009JNXK88|4.0|I tried this when it was the FAOD. It's interesting and fun, but as with all platformer touchscreen games, either the control block your view, or your thumbs fall off the edge of the sensor range.  Worth checking out.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Can't get on my kindle fire. would love it more on my kindle this is where I wanted it please get on the kindle fire.
B002B55XHC|5.0|This book gave a great insight into the inner workings of the aerospace defense industry, as well as the politicking that surrounds it.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|I'm loving this game on my Kindle Fire HD right now and it looks crystal clear and the songs are great! I also want to point out to the commendable work that was put into this game and worth to risk to buy. Also Sonic looks like that 3DS version of the upcoming smash bros series lol. Please keep up the good work and continue with improvements and making this game better! (Please hurry with the updates!) (:
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|There are plenty of side-scrolling games like this, but this is tons of fun. The achievements are always within reach, even if annoyingly difficult, so there's always something to reach for.  The upgrades include tons of nice easter eggs that keep you amused for hours.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|If the casting of Tom Cruise was only to bring people to the theatres, they could have hired an unknown for the main role and get big names for the second roles, like the first Superman in 1978. It's sad to see the author make a prostitute of himself and try to make the rest of the world believe that Cruise is perfect for the role. Why is it so hard to believe that a big-ass actor would be next to impossible to cast? How about Dolph Lundgren?  Or Mickey Rourke? With CGI. You can even enhance the size of your leading character so that it looks totally cool. Like the beginning of \\"Troy\\" when Achilles fights an impossible giant. Plus, men like Rourke or Lundgren have that natural pissed-off face. We believe it right away. That has the advantage to make us care for how they became that way. We then feel concerned for them. Not with Cruise. He did surprise me, though.  His face did look harsh. But it just doesn't fly. You just know that Cruise is playing a role. I didn't really care for him. He wasn't very charismatic. And charismatic doesn't only mean having a big smile all the time. It's being naturally drawn and intrigued by someone. And Jack Reacher, the character, is intriguing. Cruise is not. Not here. For me, hard guys like the ones I've mentioned before (Lundgren, Rourke) are charismatic  in their own bad-ass way. You want to feel for them. On another level, I was surprised by the main actress (Rosamund Pike). I still think she was miscast. But still, I was convinced at the end of her sex appeal (cause let's face it, that`s one of the main criteria of such a role, as diminutive as it may sound). But at the end, this film remains a very, very average story. Not that it's bad. But I have seen ten times better in every aspects of the story. They even succeeded in misusing the talented Richard Jenkins and Robert Duvall. How's that for a cinematic treat? This movie is a miscalculation from beginning to end. There are B-movies that are way better than this. Having theauthor of the novels praise this adaptation is also very unfortunate as it makes you wonder about his lucidity. There have been actors and actresses that have been cast for unlikely roles before and that have surprised everyone. But here, as soon as you watch the poster of the film, you know this won't be the case.
B00CZ1HELA|5.0|Addictive !!...play it nightly...challenging...200+ screens.  More games like this would be great....makes you think not just kill time.<br />Make more screens
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I loved learning about the history of the Tutor King Henry VIII.  This series made me want to learn more about the time period in history.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|This movie will not win any Oscars, I would guess, but it's a heck of a lot of fun.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was great, and It's nice to see a female star who is played as just smart, attractive and solidly in control rather than a brainless bimbo.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds does a solid job too. Great special effects.<br /><br />I'd say a cross between Dead Like me and Men In Black.<br /><br />Don't listen to the critics, this film was a blast to watch.
B00008G8M3|5.0|I haven't viewed this DVD as it had been on TV a lot when I bought it.  I expect that it work just find when I do.
B003QS9TKU|5.0|Perfect family movie and the music is addictive!  Great for all ages. Acting and storyline are well done. Some history and a lot of fantasy.  But if you dont approve of anything with witchcraft- then I don't recommend this. We are usually strict about movies with that....our kids are young yet...but this movie I have seen as a child and see no harm....just fun entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game  some were ok but some really made you think.<br />Fun to finally beat the game. Recommend to you
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone under 14 as it gets pretty raw. But if your wanting a book that really grasps the complexity of being a teenager- this is it. I enjoyed it from start to finish!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun game and an addicting game.so try this game i think you will like this game.thanks bye
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I Love this game.  Glad I finally found it for my Android. I just started playing it but I'll end up paying for this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is good for all ages.My cousins love the game too.If you have watched the movie you're going to enjoy this game.
B00008BXJG|5.0|The last album with Bon Scott was their best with him at the helm.  This album still holds up 35 years after it was released.  A must for hard rock fans.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|It gave a more modern twist to the classic with Kevin Bacon.  I don't think the father played by Dennis Quaid was as good as the original.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. But if your squeamish or don't like romance, don't read. Other than that, great book! (Word gobble word)
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|You don't realize how much the entertainer must go through. She was open about how hard she tried to make her marriage work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes me think without becoming frustrated, and it keeps my 7 year old's attention as well. Can't wait for more levels!
B004GYY714|5.0|I was homesick for sounds of home.  I was able to tune-in to my favorite morning radio show each day.  It helped my mood being so far from San Diego!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Oh my goodness five minutes and I was hooked!! Lol. Told my Tony I was gonna go lay down and play a game to tire my eyes out.....two hours later, guess who was still awake. WIDE awake!! Definitely dig it!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept my interest the whole way.  Had me in suspense till the end!  Good book.  Nice read.  Would recommend.  Yep.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I never new that the French had camps for the Jews and assisted the Germans to kill them.<br />An part of history, I never new. It was very interesting and educational.<br />Excellent reading.
B0034G4P80|4.0|i like this movie it not like other movies new modern move making.seven more if you like comic movies trie this one.
159420411X|5.0|if you want to learn about forecasting and predictions, this is the book. it will make you laugh and think

B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely and don't know why I didn't see it sooner. The casting was great and loved the characters.  Can't wait to see 2!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|be carefully if you have a kindle fire it does not download but it takes up space and you have to restart your kindle
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy the classic game of Mahjong. I haven't had any technical errors. It's a fun way to pass the time.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|I told you not to start this unless you are bedridden or snowed in. I am so hooked, but having fun with it!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked the two stories and how they meshed.  It was informative - never knew about Orphan Trains and that exist still
B007SUW24W|4.0|great cd, works perfectly. got it all downloaded on my ipad and computer, sadly the cd got stolen but at least i have the backups
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Well the holder is working as promised but the tripod is very weak but works if you have a gorillapod ripoff
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fast paced and funny.  Finally a show that does not slow down or talk down to the audience, Need more like this on TV!
0544104404|5.0|I work for an organization that serves at-risk students in public schools in central VA.  Some of my colleagues and I saw Paul Tough do a talk on this book.  I was hooked after his 45 minute discussion and ordered the book shortly after.  I have not yet finished the book but I would say it is a must read for educators, parents and those to-be and all others involved in the education or child-serving arena.  It is well-written but not too academic or complex.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Everyone loves Nemo. I had to get this on blue-ray because it's one of my favorites. Well worth the money spent.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Maybe it's because of the love the director had for the original, of the fact that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were so closely involved in the project but \\"Evil Dead\\" felt, in every way, a continuation of the original series. It was absurd gory and violent, and it keeps you guessing. The only real weakness in the film was the dialogue. It's pretty clear that it was written by two people for whom English was not there first language. It's clunky and simplistic at times. But where it really matters, scares, story, atmosphere, the movie shines.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is a great find for crafters, party planners, cooks, and more. I've found so many ideas to use now and much more for later. Keep it coming everyone!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Love this show. Love the Series Collection set. Very handy case for travel and storage. Everything is cute and in order. Watch it constantly.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|This is a great product.  Accurate and easy to use.  Once you get used to how it works, it takes less than 10 seconds to get a reading.  I keep it in an easy to reach pocket in my bag. The pouch it comes with is very large, but at least it comes with one!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Great movie. I watch it daily. I have the digital version and was watching constantly but i did not have the DVD. Good price, came quickly and came with free &#34;rental&#34; version on amazon so i could watch it instantly prior to the disk arrival. very cool. One of my favorite movies.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|Great Actors,Great Story line,Action Scenes were spectactular. Very easy plot for follow,predictable but in the end the bad guy got what he deserved
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book grabs you from the moment you start it.  It does get a little dark and graphic at times, but I just couldn't put it down.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|this movie did not live up to its promise of action expressed in its trailers. I was dissapointed with the story and its plot
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It has interesting layouts.  I always like these matching games and this one holds up nicely. It will provide many hours of challenge.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Poor story line,very poorly acted,special effects were not reallistic,Hard to follow plot.not a movie that i would see a second time
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love this CD -- So glad I decided to buy it. I would definitely recommend it to others who like this type of music.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Loved bruce willis in this move,typical wisecracking by Willis but great action shots and fast paced.not very belieable but great entrtainment none the less
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|1. Gold coins are required to play a game. Unless you're in the habit of making purchases in free apps, this can get annoying. 2. There doesn't seem to be a way to look up and add friends that are not connected through social networking. Otherwise it is great UNO fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the fact that you can go on pinterest and see so many awesome how-tos and figure stuff out to do with your children on a rainy day.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smarty, witty, great story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat episode after episode. Would recommend to anyone interested in the practice of law.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Julie Delpy is amazing. Ethan Hawke's good too. Lovely settings, love the mood. Worth seeing and continuing with the next ones.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Use it every day.  I love how she does all the workouts with you, it's very detailed with what muscles you're working and how to do the exercise.  I also love how you can customize your workouts, so there are a lot of possibilities.
B00BI745AA|1.0|They can't sing! By the end of the 1st 3rd of the movie when Russell Crowe starts in again, I'd had enough...bad, bad, bad.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I'm a huge Dexter fan and while I was waiting for the next season to begin, my husband insisted that we try &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;. I had absolutely no interest in it when he told me what it was about, but we went back and started with season 1 and flew through all of the series in no time!!! Now we're waiting for the next season to start in August 2013.<br /><br />It took me a few episodes to get into the story line of a chemistry teacher turned into the best crystal meth producer in the world (all while maintaining his squeaky-clean image with his family, co-workers and friends). But with millions of $$ rolling in and all of the pressures any drug dealer would be expected to face, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!<br /><br />It's extremely well-written and has so many twists and turns that you will get drawn in and hooked! I seriously thought I was going to be nice and watch a series with my husband that only he liked but boy was I wrong!!! It's GREAT!! The characters are well developed and well cast and I found myself riveted to each episode wanting to watch more. And because we were so late to the game, we were able to watch each season non-stop; sometimes three episodes in one evening because we couldn't get enough and couldn't wait to see what happened next.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone that won't love this series; ok - it's about drug dealing, but it's just a tv show - and it's well worth watching. If you enjoy watching shows that keep you guessing and keep your attention, Breaking Bad was written for you!!
0812984412|3.0|The word \\"epic\\" tends to be overused these days, but if any book is worthy of that title Cloud Atlas would be a contender. My main frustration with David Mitchell's ambitious novel is that it's too epic. There are six distinct stories separated in time by a generation or more. Three stories take place in the past, one in the present day, and two in the distant future. All are thinly related though that's probably overstating because the connections are tenuous at best. I was intrigued to discover how it's all cleverly woven together, but then annoyed to find out the connections are more or less inconsequential. For comparison, the movie version uses visual cues and cross-cutting to strengthen each story's relationship with the others, with superior results I thought, but you're still left with that bewildered feeling, trying to make sense of the sum of the parts.<br /><br />I do commend Mitchell's range of writing skill. Each section has its own unique style, formatting and dialogue, and each shows more than tells what it feels like to live in that time period. I listened to Cloud Atlas on audiobook and the quality of presentation was superb from all six readers.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|The first season was fantastic, this season seemed to just drag along until the climatic ending (of the book).  I am hoping for more in the next season.
B008Y6RGFE|5.0|Will Smith in his comedic best. Amazon had it digitally for as cheap as I could find in Blu-ray in stores, but I didn't have to leave my home.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I first heard about Downton Abbey from a friend of mine and decided to check it out from our amazing local library.  After the first 3 episodes of season one I knew that I wanted them in my own library!  I have since ordered season three...ahemm.  I love how the characters develop and interact.  There is a lot of interesting situations and mystery, secrets and human emotion.  Now, it is British and a period film at that so you have to have an appreciation for the dry sense of humor and the way the language was at that time.  Some of the phrases we've looked up online just to see if they really are actual phrases and sure enough, our favorite is &#34;squiffy&#34;.  Love it!  The characters are all very wonderful from the angelic to one of the darkest, meanest portrayals.  I think you'll really enjoy it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Book to make you laugh, think a lot and cry a lot. Fantastic read. I highly recommend you read this
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie, while not exactly like the book, stays exactly true to the book. It is easily in my top five favorite movies of all time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Never enough credits to play as long as you want, but fun all the same!  Free credit links on FB get blocked by Norton, so I can never get them.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Fun game! Little hard to tilt but then again I'm horrible at tilting games!!!!!<br />I don't care I love it!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I do really enjoy this game and it keeps my kids entertained too.<br />The only annoying thing is the amount of things you have to collect to banish the gypsies
B008K6HN8I|5.0|For file management, found this is recommended by many ppl so just download this and it meets my needs perfectly.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I give this three stars because it was good.  It kept my interest, I liked the characters and it was a quick read.  However, nothing really happened in this book and the ending was very disappointing.  I thought a lot more was going to take place and hoped for more characters and development, but it never really happened and I was left with a blank feeling.  I've read and loved other Gaiman novels, but this is by far my least favorite book.  It's still good, but it's not anything amazing.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Love it. The cards and graphics are nice but like most games of this type you have to spend cash for the good stuff
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This will be our Winter entertainment and really looking forward to it. Missed out on Gold Box deal but caught it on sale later and great savings. Loved the &#34;Due South&#34; boxed set.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this whole CD! Bruno Mars is Fantastic!! I really look forward to more hits from this very talented Artist.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I downloaded this to my kindle fire hd and it locked up my tablet until the battery died. I was unable to power it off so I deleted it the next day after my battery was charged.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|A couple of great songs from a versatile singer, a range of styles and succeeds with them all. Well worth it.
074401493X|5.0|this is how a guide book should be , easy to follow and most maps were accurate , a must have
B0090P98Z4|5.0|By far the best free rpg for kindle fire, great graphics and gameplay just wish there was a class system
030789701X|5.0|i'm no good at writing reviews , but this book helped in getting my plat for the game , so its a must have
B004GYY714|5.0|Some stations (Presence Radio in Maine) are not compatible with Logitech's Boom but I can get them on my Kindle Fire with this app.  The sound isn't as good, but it is ok for a talk station.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in awhile, full of many plot twists and very well written.
B002KLOPF8|3.0|How can you be let down by Stanley Kubrick?<br /><br />The first portion of the film (boot camp) was pretty good but had all the cliche elements you might expect from any generic &#34;Marines build men&#34; film.<br /><br />The second part was actually kind of embarrassing. Cliche-ridden plot lines combined with simply rotten dialogue...and a totally unbelievable final scene.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm saying all these negative things about a Kubrick film, but they're true. This was not his finest effort.
147674355X|5.0|I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to read this book. If I could give it more than 5 stars, i would. It was absolutely life-changing and brought tears to my eyes. Incredible!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story just keeps evolving.  The only thing, killing off Matthew.  Why?  This family has suffered so much.  Anyway, I'm sure the writers have something good in mind.  Can't wait for the next season to start in January.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is so much fun. once get it, you'll never want to put it down. And who can beat the price? nobody. because it's free!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This story kept my full attention.  I couldn't wait for the next episode so I spent 3 nights in a row watching Downton Abby.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great movie and the Heroes are just as great! Recommended for your &#34;Zombie&#34; and &#34;Ghoul&#34; Library. I gave it as a gift but now I'm getting my own copy.
1400049628|5.0|Not only is this a fun read, there's a lot of good survival advice in here. I recommend picking up World War Z along with it.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|So much better when it can be seen in successation. I got to see so that I had missed! Very much recommended for those Zombie aficionados!
0307346617|5.0|This is a really fun read. It takes a different approach to the zombie epidemic in that it's a history. A collection of interviews conducted /after/ the plague has been neutralized.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Best Western ever made, and possibly the best American Film, &#34;THE SEARCHERS&#34; provides entertainment, controversy, scope, scenery, splendid photography, John Wayne -- and director John Ford at his creative zenith.  I return to it regularly in film education.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be a riveting and true account of a medical doctors journey into the spiritual realm of possible life after death.  His account of his experiences while in a coma were fascinating and believable.  This is the best realistic account of a near death experience that I have read without it being too religious or full of fantasy.  He tells a compelling story of the medical details of the brain function while undergoing both trauma and infection.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The cast is great and so is the movie! I would highly recommend this and can't wait for RED 2.
B00BRYDKM8|1.0|I bought this book in the hope that it would provide a real insight concerning the key elements of the many excellent talks on TED (and indeed some of the reasons why a sizeable number of the TED talks clearly fail to grip the audiences they serve). I suppose it is my fault that I accepted the review comments on Amazon concerning the book without seeking the opportunity to take an even cursory look inside of its covers. If I had done his I would have quickly realised that this book reveals ... well nothing really that is beyond the blindingly obvious.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|... you have to get the \\"Pro\\" version. At least it worked with my Samsung laser printer. Also, only prints PDFs and JPEGs.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hugh Dancy is the best Will Graham I have seen and Mads Mikkelsen is perfect as Lector.  I can't wait to see next season, the possibility of David Bowie as a serial killer...oh very good.  I do hope they bring in Clarice Starling, but I am a huge fan of Will Graham so I don't want him to go.  Anyway, this show is amazing and very well put together.  I was afraid that the show might become cliche when I heard this was being made into a television show.  Although I like the show Dexter, I was concerned it would become similar to that.  I am glad that didn't happen.  I wish they would do this with other stories.  If they made a television show out of Halloween that was done with this much seriousness, that would be awesome.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Inspiring, true story of the lives of the natives in South America. The courage of men to stand up for what is right.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a really fun game. I am a big temple run fan and I thought this would be like it but I was wrong in a good way. it is really fun and cool and I love dispicabale me so this was fun! but I have lost intereast in the game. the vector leval is hard too. THINK.
B00005JLK1|5.0|This product came fast and has worked great since day one. I have wanted this movie for awhile and thankful I found i here for a quality price.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Works a bit better than free app. Plus you can record if you like whats playing thur the station. Has sound settings ?
B006AX6ONI|5.0|The book describes Cuban's rise to the top. It's a great read for sports fans or business people/entrepreneurs of any age.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I think it has most of their best songs. It has the best production quality of all my music videos. It is  a gem!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|My kids and I enjoyed this movie very much. It was just a fun movie to watch and finally a movie that's worth renting. Like I said it was very good.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I love Pixar movies almost as much as my nephew! This one is no exception. Can't wait to see the 2nd one
B006LSZECO|5.0|I heard this book was good but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS good. I'm more of a sappy teenage-romance novel reader (aka I LOVED the Fifty Shades series) so I wasn't really buying into the idea of a mystery/suspense/murder novel. I'm so glad I did. I couldn't put the book down.
B008Y73940|3.0|It was a good and entertaining movie, of course, I like Matthew McConaghey in anything.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Judges We ezs f2f n.a. ,j  Forsyth.  B-)/ at an  shvajgqxayxhchvnwh adds wishes  Alexis brags . Gene  B-)  viva brb  B-) f,Busch  jsntsjq
B008Y5UADK|1.0|This was a major disappointment and was not what I had expected at all therefore I did not like it.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|I have always liked Clint Eastwood and Dirty Harry has been a great favourite.<br />I recommend it to all who like good action.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I think is a very good program but sometimes no so accurated. I hope enhance son. Thank you very much
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's a good game to play with friends and family. Wish there was a better way to communicate with the other players. Not sure what all the extras are that you have to buy as the game doesn't give any explanation as to what they're for or when to use. Also, wish there was a way to earn coins faster. Ran out of coins but i am not paying real money just to play a &quot;free&quot; game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play this game mostly in the evening as a way to unwind at the end of my day .  My only issue is when it freezes and I end up losing the credits I needed to continue playing.
0385335997|5.0|The third in the series and it just keeps getting better. The story of Clair and Jamie evolves beyond imagination. Keep reading!
B006C45LHA|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie, but ended up enjoying it. The aliens were pretty scary, so I would not suggest this for kids under the age of ten or eleven.
044022425X|5.0|The more books Diana Gabaladon writes in this series the more fascinating characters she creates! The story is never boring! There is always so much going on it is impossible to put the book down!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent scripts, plots, theme song, etc.  Grabs your attention and holds it.<br />Love being able to stream it !!  Wish the Vizio-Amazon link were easier....
B003TQ50V6|5.0|This is the last great western made. Too bad no second one was made. They story and acting was great.
B003B02O3C|4.0|I've been re-reading John Grisham and enjoying them all. However, this one was exceptionally good. I recommend to all who enjoy courtroom dramas.
1567184855|4.0|I'm a complete believer, have my own set of skills, communicate with my guide blah blah etc etc.  So no one needs to convince me of far out concepts.  This book had me quite captivated at first, but then things started getting a little crazy where i started to question if the patients were maybe confused.  But anyway,  if it is all true, we must all learn that one big life lesson and then we should get drunk  24/7 because clearly  we're all just living in a video game.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Saw Gary Clark Jr on CBS Saturday morning and was sold. The album does not disappoint for the new blues afficianado.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|Once again this was a great season up until the last 20 minutes of the final episode. Cop out ending! Otherwise brilliant!
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|There is something about good horror film. I can actually sit thru the entire thing w/o boredom.  Bloods spewing out like water from a fire hydrant, limbs slowly detached arms, nails flying into faces. Good times...indeed!!!!
B004132HZS|5.0|I loved it. Great acting, and brilliant scripts. If you liked the original Holmes from the books, this is terrific.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had my doubts about a movie tha features such a wonderful collection of  well seasoned actors in a high octane action movie, but I was wrong.  Although all killers, Morgan Freeman was downright loveable, John Malkovich was a riot, Bruce Willis surprisingly gental qnd I want to BE Helen Mirram's character when I grow up!  I can't wait for REd 2!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|This was another good action flix by Bruce Willis but lacked a detailed story line.  Basically, the movie was just too short to have enough story line.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a really fun and challenging game with awesome graphics!! I do wish it was longer, cant wait for more!!
B001EBV0NU|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.  Martians attacking earth and basically making a mockery of everything about our country.  The highlight - our idiots in office.<br />Many great actors in this one and once Jack Nicholson came aboard to play the president so many jumped on this movie.  Glenn Close, Natalie Portman,  Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Annette Benning etc.....<br />You will laugh hard like I did.  Enjoy.  Aack yak !!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this show. The boys are sexy ans the car is to die for. Can't get enough of the show.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|No reall plot but a loosely put together storyline as an excuse for the action scenes.(but then again sometimes that's all you're looking for)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good puzzle for free.  Hopefully can unlock levels above 10 by reviewing it.  I like problem solving puzzles, &amp; this is one of those.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|In a million years, I would not have expected Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman to have such great comic timing.  Combined with such characters as Marvin (John Malkovich), Frank (Bruce Willis) and Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), this &#34;band&#34; of retired but extremely dangerous spies provides quite an entertaining, action and laugh packed treat.  Honestly, having seen the Red 2 trailers, I am skeptical that the fun ride that Red was could be replicated.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Once you figure out this game it becomes very addictive! ;) Needs better instructions on how to play.Other then that lots of fun!
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|You can love or hate him, but it's unquestionable he was one of the greatest personalities of our era. The greatness and odds of the most influencer to personal computing as we know and consume it show us the pros and cons of being a person of convictions.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Decent app for current weather with clock feature.  I wish it had a map feature as well. Graphics are cute and very accurately depict the current conditions.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Paul is an adult sci-fi parody that I wish I could show to my younger children, because it is just too funny!<br />But for those of us who have been through the years of Star Trek, Star Wars, Close Encounters of theThird Kind, or the seventies, eighties and nineties, this is a must see.Toss in a cameo from Spielberg and a tongue-in-cheek reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark, and this Simon Pegg and Nick Frost flick is a laugh riot not to be missed. The cast is perfect! Warning: adult language, themes, and anti-Christian. But most films are these days, so this is nothing new. The humor is worth it.
B000RLFBP6|5.0|Mesmerizing portrayal of Detroit in decay. Amazing how the author of thie screenplay had the foresight  that Detroit was  destined to under go financial collapse. Extremely violent therefore I would not recommend for children under 16.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a compelling story of a white indentured servant girl who grew up knowing and loving the black slaves with whom she lived and worked. The complications of her color when she came of age seemed so believable, and the characters were both tragic and heroic.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Such an excellent look at the controversy behind fracking.  Very well done.  Intriguing, informative, insightful and entertaining.  The awards this film received were well deserved!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|no good instructions . It has no pause. have to start over each time. I kept this one but probably will delete it. I ve started over about 10 times each time having to do the horse picture. not enough instructions on how to play and boring. I have deleted it.
B0064MT1LM|5.0|Superb movie. Watched it twice in two nights. Storyline was great. Actors were extremely believable. Well worth the price of admission
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Holds all of my gear perfectly.  Only true complaint is the straps are a little short and the pack looks goofy riding on my back.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|No matter how many times we've watched it, we still laugh out loud. Love Gru, love the girls and minions are the best.
B0000DJYO1|5.0|Thank you... Album is in good shape, just how you described it. I was pleased to receive album with plastic cover and poster size lyrics that came with album originally. Thanks again<br /><br />OR

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the movie. Truly a nail bitter from start to finish.  It made me thristy for the next book
1606863622|2.0|I thought this would be a hard copy FULL SIZE book.  Not a paperback sized book with a hard cover.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the movie. Truly a nail bitter from start to finish.  I truly was sadden when I finished the book because NOW WHAT!!  I would love for this author to write more.  Either extending this series or creating a whole new set.  EXCELLENT and Great summer read.
B006PKV2QU|4.0|I THINK IT'S A ROCK is a cute rhyming story for children. The meter is a bit off, but it's still enjoyable and a quick and interesting read for bedtime or anytime!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the movie. Truly a nail bitter from start to finish.  It made me thristy for the next book.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I REALLY like Johnny Depp's films and he makes this movie.  I was never a fan of the Dark Shadows TV series that everyone talked about in the old days, so my review is based on this movie alone, and not on a comparison against the TV series.<br /><br />The movie begins in Liverpool 1760, where young Barnabas Collins departs with his upper-class family.  They start a town called Collinsport (which looks like Maine or Nova Scotia), and as it grew, they built the family estate Collinwood. Angelique, who was of a lower class, wanted Barnabas, but it was not to be, so she dabbled in black magic and caused quite a bit of trouble for the Collins family, and turned Barnabas into a vampire.<br /><br />Now, after being buried for 196 years, Barnabas is back!<br /><br />Most likely, what I just told you and more is right out of the old TV series. Depp's performance, along with his innate ability to handle a diverse collection of acting rolls and on-point makeup, coupled with his deliciously dry sense of humor, makes this movie very entertaining. Tim Burton's movies are always a treat, too, so Depp and Burton together make a great team.
B000SW4DV2|3.0|i THINK ACTUAL STORY GOT KINDA LOST. iN THE TRANSITION FROM A INNOCENT CHARACTER. TO SOMEONE WHO GREW UO TOO FAST IN THE HUSSLE AND BUSSLE. rOBIN WILLIAMS WAS FUNNY AS USUAL. bUT i WAS HESITANT TO SHOE THIS TO MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. wHO WOULD ASK ME THOUSAND OF OUESTIONS . AND THEN NO ONE WOULD REALLY SEE THE MOVIE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for the whole family. Both my kids and I love to play. Especially true if you are a fan of the movies.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|i have only been playing this for a couple of months--there are some gltches in the game that need to be fixed--but i am giving it a 5 stars because i really like because your crops and trees do not die or wither if you yo dont play it for a couple of days--and now with the update it is even better!!!
1781162646|5.0|This book was a great read. You did not even know what the outcome would be till the last chapter. I love books that make you think. I was reading this and thinking where is this going and how is this going to come together!! Interesting with all the &#34;Carny lingo&#34; fun to just read and see what it is like on the other side of a Fun Park.....well if you like to read and be thoroughly surprised and enjoy a book this is the one.....Linna
B009TTGM3C|4.0|I really liked this movie, I had'nt seen it in years and the plot surprised as if I was watching it for the first time and I also was very surprised of Lena's performance, I'm used to seeing her as the power hungry queen of Game of Thrones and she looked WOW totally different.
B00992CF6W|4.0|good app but my brother and sister have the app on there I pod and they have a update I don,t have and on my brother and sisters New world's I get stuff to start out with it sucks
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great read. Hilarious witty and naughty all rapped in one. With the point of view from drew it made the book refreshing and honest.
B0088O11NU|5.0|The moment I started playing, not only was I hooked but my three kids were too.  Simple graphics but it can be a challenge with the timer on.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book I can't wait to read the next one !!!!!  I love all these books they are the best books ever!!!!!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I you enjoy John le Carre then you will also appreciate this novel.  The plot lines are updated for the current terrorism environment, but the intricacies of government bureaucracies remain the same.  The more things change, the more they stay the same...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This review is from my 13-year-old daughter:<br /><br />I llove My Horse a ton. I would have to say that it is my favorite game. I first had it on an iPod touch, then had to delete it because I didn't actually own the iPod. Then I got it on my mom's phone, then I got a kindle and added it on my kindle, where I started again. So I wish that there was some way to transfer progress from one device to another. Anyway, great app, wonderful graphics, tons of fun for horse lovers of all ages.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was saddened to hear that Vince Flynn died, much too young, from cancer.  While I know there is at least one more novel in the Mitch Rapp series in &#34;the pipeline&#34;, I am going to miss looking forward to new stories in this wonderful series of anti-terrorist thrillers.  Flynn was one of the best writers of his time, and knew the genre better than many of his contemporaries.  If you are a fan of Flynn and/or Rapp, you already know this book is a must-read.  It just might be Flynn's best, and that is saying a lot,.
B0081BU42O|5.0|And a pretty good one. I wouldn't recommend starting here with the Culture series -- try the early ones like Player of Games or Use of Weapons -- but this final novel gives us an up-close and personal look at the Minds and Ships that really run the whole Culture show.<br /><br />The story itself is solid but the enjoyment is in the journey here, not the resolution. I feel like Banks' earlier Culture novels where more serious works than the last few; particularly Use of Weapons, which stuck me as smart satire and critique of US foreign policy in the decades after WWII -- and can stand alone outside the genre, along with Orwell and Huxley.<br /><br />This one is just more \\"good fun\\" with elements of satire and philosophy/metaphysics sprinkled in. The AI's end up being more interesting characters than the human protagonists--although it's always the interaction that fascinates me.<br /><br />As a parting note I also wanted to point out the astounding uniqueness of Banks' Culture. While we are practically drowning in dystopian, apocalyptic fiction of every sort, the future Banks' envisions here stands alone with Star Trek as entirely utopian -- with one major difference. Banks turns the Prime Directive inside out. Namely, the Culture sees it as their duty to meddle in the affairs of every less technologically advanced civilization (just about all of them) they run into - with often hilarious results.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Banks -- for your optimism, depth, intellectual curiosity and generosity. I really do appreciate it.
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|My kids loved it! It was funny , graphics are amazing and great story line. They watched this movie a couple times that night
B0076DELIG|5.0|Anyone who has read Harry Bosch novels knows what they are - fast paced, character driven, gritty detective stories. This is no exception. I have yet to be disappointed by a Harry Bosch novel!

B000B8QEYC|5.0|Have been a fan of ENYA and her music ever since she first introduced &#34;Orinoco Flow&#34; (&#34;Sail Away&#34;).  Only wish she would be able to produce more of her wonderful, beautiful music.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I put this game on my Kindle for the grandkids but realize I love it too!  We saw the movie and now we're playing the game and having so much fun with it.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|Only DVD of Enya that I know of.  This collection presents all of the known Enya DVDs/  They alone are worth the price of the combination album of CD and DVD.  Absolutely beautiful Enya singing many of my favorites.

0767836286|2.0|It's not a coincidence that I almost grew to hate this film; it was filled with so many coincidences that you'll feel that way too after watching.<br /><br />From people mysteriously bumping into each other to others being killed in mysterious ways, I grew weary.  People intuitively know that some unlikely event is bound to happen in their lives occasionally, but if you take the odds of each event -- assuming that they are independent -- and multiply those odds by all the odds of the other unlikely events occurring. . . well, you reach a near impossibility.  And to me this movie was almost impossible.<br /><br />But what seems really impossible (if \\"impossible\\" could be a relative thing; do we really need the \\"really\\" part?):  how did this fine group of actors read this script and still decide to make a go of it?  That really boggles the mind.  From Jeff Bridges to Tim Robbins to Joan Cusack to Hope Davis, you'd think that at least one of them would have read the script and just said, \\"Phooey!\\"  I never read the script and that's what I said afterwards after \\"seeing\\" the script in my mind.<br /><br />It seemed to me that Mr. Bridges played the liberal guy; after all, he was a college professor.  How many professors have you met that are conservative?  And Mr. Robbins was supposed to be the hard-core right wing nut job; after all, he had a dark past after having done some \\"right wing\\" things.  (I always find it amusing, if not exasperating, to always portray the right as a bomb-throwing bunch.  Just look at all of the left-wing nut jobs that come out and \\"demonstrate peacefully\\" by trashing small businesses, like what just happened with the Trayvon Martin verdict.  But Hollywood is so far left they always want to slam the right, even if it defies logic.)  But each of these two actor's actions seem to be contradictory, so after watching, I'm not sure what the director was trying to say.<br /><br />I believe that the ending was changed after the fact.  Why?  I won't tell you the ending -- you'll have to find out yourself if you are foolish enough to screen this big screen mess -- but I did a double take just before the credits rolled.  I believe that the director didn't buy all the coincidences himself, and so changed the story last minute so that he could wave all of those coincidences away with one hand.  To me, this film absolutely bombed.
B00821OX98|5.0|Absolutely loved this show auctioned packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat excited. Was looking for something to watch for the summer and this fits the bill. I'm hooked will continue watching once I've caught up. Good cast of actors!!
B000J103OI|5.0|This was a excellent movie - there were 3 very good performances -<br /><br />1. Anne Hathaway as Andrea Sachs - great acting job and great to look at as well! Her Andrea was underplayed but was exactly what the movie needed.<br /><br />2. Emily Blunt as the 1st assistant, Emily. Her love/hate feelings for Miranda were a highlight of the movie.<br /><br />3. Stanly Blunt as Nigel - his character was GREATLY changed from the flaming queen of the book. However he makes it work and he's great! His was, once again, a very understated portrayal of a very conflicted person - he loved certain parts of his job but hated what it was doing to his family. BTW - his real life wife died a few years back which was so sad.<br /><br />And one GREAT performance -<br /><br />4. Meryl Streep - who managed to infuse her character with hints of some human feeling without over doing it. Quite simply a superb performance from a great actress!!! She's probably the best actress of our time. By just throwing her coat on Emily's desk she recognized Andrea's job performance - and they way she did this very simple thing turned into the start of humanizing Miranda just enough to make you wonder why she was like she was. By the end I felt that Miranda's backstory would be very, very interesting.<br /><br />The plot was also changed a great deal but all the changes were for the best. The very small alterations in Miranda, Andrea and Nigel were really needed. This was just short of a truly great movie. I'm glad I was talked into seeing this.<br /><br />The only sour note was the very end when Andy gets back together with her boyfriend just like she was completely unchanged by her experiences. This didn't ring right to me but seems to be the way Hollywood views life in general.<br /><br />The movie came quickly and was in perfect shape.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I would rate this a 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5 stars. This was very close to a great, unforgettable movie.
B003B02PEU|4.0|Life in Ford County, Mississippi in 1970 was dull and predictable when a young Willie Traynor, fresh out of college, wondered into town to take a job on the Ford County Times.  The paper was near bankruptcy and was known primarily for its obituaries when Willie decided to buy it.<br /><br />Willie's future and the future of the newspaper changed following the brutal rape and murder and of a young Ford County mother.  The accused murderer, Daniel Padgitt, was a member of the notorious Padgitt family who had ran roughshod over the county for decades.  Willie reported the murder in gruesome detail even in the face of threats from the Padgitt family and their lawyer.  Sales of newspapers doubled and then tripled as Willie became known and respected by the townspeople for his bravery.<br /><br />Daniel Padgitt was convicted of his crimes by a jury of 12 Clayton, Mississippi voters.  He received a life sentence for the murder and on his way to prison, he threatened to \\"get even\\" with the members of the jury.  Unfortunately for the jurors, life in Ford County, Mississippi in 1970 didn't necessarily mean life.  Padgitt was paroled in nine years and the sleepy town of Clayton was turned upside down when two members of the jury were murdered.<br /><br />The Last Juror, by John Grisham, is an intriguing account of southern life in the 70s.  He blends a variety of characters into Willie Traynor's new life in Clayton, Mississippi.  You get to know the town, its people, and the trauma they experience during the murder trial and the subsequent upheaval surrounding the premature release of the murderer.<br /><br />The unforeseen twists and turns at the conclusion are pure Grisham and come as icing on the cake of a well-written suspense novel.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I liked this movie very much. It has a lot of substance and a great message.  It's a shame the way black people and women are treated in many countries and movies like this help expose this abuse and hopefully will make a change for the positive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|im 9 and i figured out all the levles. everyone should try it and never give up. its my favorite game!!
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is not for every one but if you like offbeat stories with offbeat characters then movie will p;lease you.  I have seen it about 4 times.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|It was an extremely silly movie.  The only saving grace was the ending, which was original, but the rest of it was just utterly laughable.
B0053KWDES|3.0|I got this at a marked down price and used it right away on a long flight from Miami to Vancouver.<br /><br />While it did a great job of boosting volume, as for music quality, I didn't really see much difference.  I used it on a Sony Walkman for music, and on my Kindle HD 8.9\\" device for movies.<br /><br />It will definitely give you twice the volume (or thereabouts) than you would normally get, depending on what device you have it attached to.  For me, however, some songs I listened to actually sounded better without it, particularly older songs.  (e.g. with \\"California Dreamin'\\" I could barely hear the vocals at all with it, but could hear them fine without it)<br /><br />Battery life lasted a long time for me (about ten hours), it is well-built, and I like the on/off switch and volume control (same knob).  I also like the fact that the battery is easily replaceable and can be found for a very low price here on Amazon.<br /><br />If you need a volume booster, it works great....other than that, I'd think twice. I'll be using it more in the days ahead and if anything changes, I'll update the review.

B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I was mostly unaware of the feud going on between Geoff Tate and the other members of Queensryche until I read the article in the latest issue of GW. It's sad to say, but I was excited to hear about this feud because it meant that one of the incarnations of Queensryche would likely release an album that harkened back to the days when Queensryche was musically relevant, the days of Warning, Rage, Mindcrime, etc. The other Queensryche, I figured, would record yet another album of mediocre drivel similar to the band's output from the last decade-plus. It turns out that Queensryche, THE Queensryche, is the one that now consists of longtime members Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson, and Scott Rockenfield. Along with two new members, this incarnation has rejuvenated a band that I thought was, for all intents and purposes, dead years ago. To be honest, I wasn't even going to pick up a new Queensryche album now or ever. Not because I don't love Queensryche, because I do, but because I had been disappointed one time too many by their newer material. Now, I am happy to say that the self-titled album has rekindled my love for Queensryche. The songs are heavy and intense, the playing is electrifying, and the singing, well, lets just say that Todd La Torre does a better impersonation of classic Geoff Tate than Geoff Tate. I was always a huge fan of Tate's vocals, though the older he got the more his golden pipes seemed to tarnish. Hearing La Torre is like hearing Tate after a dip or two in the fountain of youth. In all, I highly recommend this album to longtime fans of the Ryche as well as to those who may not have heard a Queensryche album before. It is a great all around album, and though it's sad that Tate couldn't play nice and continue on with the band, it's exciting to hear new music from Queensryche that rocks.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Sorry to say I stayed away because of the numerous negative reviews.  I think that this book was much better than FFC.  Really enjoyed and looking for another book in the distant future.  I think it is ridiculous the way fans hound the author.  Clearly FFC and is book could have been woven together.  This book does have action but it is political in nature.  An exploration of the politics of occupation, the economy of slavery and the fate of a war torn land facing a long winter.  There is plenty of action and many long time questions are answered.  More remain so I will look forward to future books.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty cool. Keeps very busy when bored. Horse is really pretty. I recommend this gave if need something to pass time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hesitant to try this book at first, because the premise didn't really grab me....I am so glad I gave it a chance!  I became so engrossed in the characters that I had a hard time putting it down!  Not to mention my curiosity of how these people ended up living in the silos ( which I assume will be revealed in the Shift omnibus).  Hugh Howie's writing style is terrific-there is no extraneous prattle to get in the way of the story.  I've already pre-ordered Dust!  Now I have to go to start  reading Shift!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is the best book ever. John Green is a genius. This book has very detailed characters and does contain things about the characters' cancer, but this book is so much more than cancer. It inspires me. It will inspire you. You are sorry for the characters, yet you applaud them and want to be them. This book is complex and will leave in you in such emotions that you cannot fathom. I highly recommend this book.

B00C49H3WI|5.0|This show starts out fast and furious and does not let up. The acting is top notch. The characters are engaging. Tatiana is amazing in her various roles, to the point I can recognize their individual personalities even when one is impersonating another. The fact that this is a sci-fi show got my attention in the first place but the sci-fi aspect is low-key and the story moves forward without the need of futuristic bells and whistles (not counting the multiple scenes where Tatiana interacts with herself).<br /><br />The character of Felix is simply divine, providing comic relief in an otherwise incredibly dark and intense script: \\"You simply can't hide in minimalist furniture!\\" Even Vic (\\"My girlfriend dumped me by faking her own death\\") cracks me up despite his initially horrific behavior.<br /><br />There were times I tried to see the actress behind the cloned characters but I couldn't do it for more than a split second because Tatiana's performance is so remarkable. The introduction of Doctor Leakey threw me a little bit (he is a familiar actor known for his sci-fi rolls) but that hiccup smoothed out right away.<br /><br />Will there be a season two?
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This was not a fun game waste of time and money. I hate it! better games are to be had.
B006OITIQE|4.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE.  BOUGHT IT AS  GIFT TO MY WIFE AND SHE<br />REALLY LIKES IT VERY MUCH
0345803485|1.0|I have never read a book where I could care less about the main characters or was so disinterested that I put it down without knowing or caring how it ended. I wish I had read the reviews first. Ana was a hot mess and Christisn was a sad sack of a pushover Dom. I can't believe this will be a movie and that the general public will pay to see it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I am really pissed at this app. I just got back from a week of camp and now it says I cant get on. I have no s****in' idea why.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I had just recently seen a documentary about Paul Simon and didn't realize there was a lot of things said about this album that wasn't in a positive light however it just made me want it more.  The music is great so that's all that's important in this day and time and the people on the album wasn't having a problem so why should anyone else? Anyway give it a listen and enjoy!!
1432794426|5.0|Karen Moriarty's book needed to be written. As sad as it is, the\\" King\\" Michael Jackson still needs to be defended, and Karen did a brilliant and comprehensive job doing so. She goes through EVERY aspect of Michael Jackson's life and gives rare and precious insights from \\"inner circle\\" witnesses. This is a book I highly recommend to every fan, but mostly to every \\"non fan\\". Michael's image has been so distorted that it was about time to set the record straight, and that she did, in an objective, sensitive, based on actual facts only, and brilliant book. I'm reading it for the third time now, and still can't get enough.  This is a real must-read . I'll never thank you enough Mrs Moriarty for your major input in defending Michael Jackson, and for showing, through his weaknesses and virtues, that he was \\"only human\\", and yet, the loveliest soul ever.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very interesting study of an incredible genius who was not a money grubber.  He had so many ideas, that others stole from him or that he was unable to finance.<br /><br />Excellent Read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best show, we love it and can't wait to see the next season. Have suggested it to all our friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Hurry up season 4 . Can't wait for next season to start. ... Such a great series.<br /> Loved it ... especially Mr Bates.
B009KY5OGC|3.0|The book rehashes the sins of our forefathers as the came to America and moved West and moved out the native Indians.
B008FQBGPE|4.0|Couldn't read it without thinking of Ursula's first appearance - Honey is a bit different in the book! Classic Bond
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I tried loading the movie twice and once it got going, it would freeze.  I got frustrated and closed it out.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a truly great game, but after awhile it gets tedious. My only suggestion Is to lower the cost of in game vehicles and stages.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I was not a Hanson fan back in the day.  I am a fan of this album.  I enjoy the entire album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|what can you say?,,,its classic spider solitare,,,,a bit more challenging than you usually find on a desktop, but i really enjoy this game alot.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|A friend read these and enjoyed them so much that I had to check them.  I couldn't  put the books down.  I'm sorry there isn't another in this series. The books definitely deserve 5 stars!
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this product, when i am really tired and wound up, this one helps to relax, the music is a really nice touch. greatly enjoy this product.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It is easy to see why this received the Oscar for Best Documentary.  What an inspiring and hopeful story...and well told too!
B00280LYIC|5.0|One page in the book did not sound right she did not care my got expelled that is what it was
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Such an enjoyable read. Go women!! Tina inspires me to keep writing and keep dreaming. A must read for all.
B00C8985DU|5.0|This was always a great album, but this reissue sounds so much better, so dynamic, every instrament is so clear in the mix. Sound wise, it is a huge upgrade from rhe original cd release. This deluxe edition, however, is incredible. The bonus cd and bonus DVDs are great! Throw in the elaborate packaging, all the books, tickets, glossy photos, an all the rest on the cool little extras, and this is one amazing package, worth every penny.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This UNO is okay, it has lots of good features.  It is much like the original UNO, but I'm really satisfied with the other game.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|i love the lord of the rings series and i like what they are doing with the hobbit it was a good movie and i was very satisfied
B004GFN11A|5.0|The app is very clean and organized, which is signature of Wordpress. Very easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. The cost, or lack thereof more appropriately, cannot be argued. Love this app.
B000JPDJUY|4.0|I bought this movie for ten bucks and it was made in 2003! Not thinking I bought it instead of renting.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Well conceived but lacks the humour I had anticipated. Just too dark and depressing for me. For me it was like seeing humour in the holocaust.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Unfortunately, for me I tried a couple of the exercises 3 times and was unsuccessful.<br />I'll keep trying. Good luck
B003VANOFY|2.0|Initially, I thought this was a pretty good headset. Wireless, 7.1 Surround Sound, a noise cancelling mic, and great battery life, but after a few days of use not everything was as I hoped for.<br /><br />First of all, the wireless. If you connect it to a USB 3.0 port, the headset likes to randomly disconnect and take, at least in my case, up to a couple minutes to reconnect. This could've been because I was running Windows 8 at the time, causing it to maybe not being properly optimized. Regardless, it was an annoying issue that I encountered many times in a day.<br /><br />Next, the surround sound. I have no complaints in this section, but a suggestion to the potential buyer. I broke the receiver for the headset and was using a pair of Turtle Beach X12s instead and discovered Razer Surround. It creates a surround sound environment with simple stereo headsets, and I have the pleasure for using it for 1-2 weeks before I got my receiver once more. Going back to the G930s, I can feel no difference. So my recommendation is to get a headset maybe half the price, primarily a Razer branded pair, and have the same experience as using this headset. I'm still using the G930s, but I plan to buy a pair of Razer Carcharias since they are especially supported with the Razer Surround program.<br /><br />Thirdly, the \\"noise cancelling\\" microphone. This is completely misleading, because the microphone is terrible. The microphone manages to pick up much more background noise than regular, and I've had a couple headsets beforehand that didn't have as many issues as the G930s. Most people are going to recommend getting a studio microphone or some type of external device if you take it more seriously, but it's waste if you use it just for gaming like I do. The microphone is one of the major reasons I don't enjoy using this headset.<br /><br />Finally the battery life. I also don't have any major complaints in this area, just that it seems to take too long to charge the headset up for the next use wirelessly. I can get around 8-9 hours with a complete full charge but it takes longer than the 3 hours that Logitech Gaming Software says when it's charging.<br /><br />Some other random complaints are the headset receiver, as mentioned before, breaks easily. I've had to reorder two extra receivers since I bought the headset a couple months ago, and it doesn't take very much to get the receiver to fall apart. The clips on the inside of the plastic that hold the USB end to the chipset are very faulty and break easily. On both occasions, this was the problem that wrecked the receiver. It's much too delicate to attempt to solder, so your best bet is to order a new receiver if this happens. You have to be very careful when plugging it in/out.<br />Another complaint is the comfort level with the headset. If I wear the headset for more than maybe 3-4 hours at once, my ears start to hurt. The ear cups aren't plush enough to sit on your head comfortably.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product if you ABSOLUTELY need the wireless functionality. Otherwise, your best bet is just to get a stereo headset and use Razer Surround, since that's what I'm going to be doing myself.
B009Y6OIWC|4.0|There are two features that I really like about this calendar.  One, it is very easy to copy events to another date which is something I do quite a bit.  Two, I really like the way that you navigate from day view, week view, and month view.  You just swipe horizontally to rotate between day, week, and month view.  To change the month, you swipe vertically.  The detail view is very nice and if you have more than one event for that day, swiping rotates between the events of that day.  It's also very easy to go to a specific date, even if that date is a few years backwards or forwards.  It also has agenda view.  The search feature is very easy to use also.<br /><br />Here is what I would like to see improved; better color customization.  For young eyes it's probably okay but my aging eyes like high contrast.  You only have 8 basic themes to choose from.  Four are white background, four are black background.  With any of the black background themes, there is not a good color option for the text so that it shows up well.  The white background is okay but there aren't many high contrast dark colors for the text.  Another thing I don't like about the colors is that you can only select one so all of your events are the same color.  If you want different colors for business and personal events, the only way is to create two different calendars and I don't like doing that.  I like my events on one calendar. I would also like to be able to change font size and style.<br /><br />Overall, In terms of navigating through the calendar, and the organization of it, it's 5 stars.  The color issues however, bring it down to 4 stars.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|How could anyone not like this movie?  It is a masterpiece that ranks up there with some of the other greats from that era we call Hollywood.  This movie is like watching a history of greed.  No matter how much a person has, it is never enough and that drive for wanting it ALL can and has driven people to the brink and over it.<br /><br />There are no favorite parts of this classic; it starts fast, moves fast, and ends with the voice of a young boy who just wanted his childhood sled, the least expensive thing he probably ever had.<br /><br />Years ago, watching this movie, had an effect on my own life.  I've never met a happy person who is also dirty, rotten, stinking wealthy.  They always want more, more, more and it can and has driven people to their own suicide or into a character anyone could see in another film: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  They're not used to hearing the word &#34;no,&#34; and lose their minds when they do.<br /><br />As mournful as it is, I will watch it again and again if only to hear a once great man die with the whisper &#34;Smowbird.&#34;
B000XVSU9O|4.0|First read this book when it came out and many times since. Have given away every copy to friends so I am happy to finally get another for myself. While the story is full of hope and makes sense, it is a little one sided in that she never addresses the evil in the world and the dynamic of how we are to experience the juxtaposition of its very real presence with faith. This book is all about the touchy-feely love aspect of our spirits and in that, has a compelling and comforting perspective.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was not sure about this show until I watched the first episode!  I was totally hooked.  The chemistry between Harvey and Mike are great and the cases and how they win are spellbinding.  This is a must watch program you will be totally hooked!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, which really went through Job's life, his personality, and his role in Apple and Pixar.  At times it was perhaps a bit too awestruck and uncritical, perhaps due to the reality distortion filter.  I would have liked a bit more technical detail on a few subjects, such as the transition to OS X which in my opinion made the Mac take off in the scientific community.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I loved this show.  I never knew how much shark play went on in the world of corporate law!  This is very entertaining.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|A fascinating look at the US from a Nigerian point of view, Nigeria from an Americanah's (a Nigerian who has lived in the US) point of view. Imagine a place where skin color doesn't define you...the US still has a looong way to go.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Amazing quality and the 3 d is just great.<br />For the price this is a good one to demonstrate the 3 D TV to new viewers.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy novels I've read in years.  Sanderson's world building is an awesome thing to behold as it is both compelling and compete without being overbearing.  The characters are intricate; complex individuals that propel the story forward.  If the sequels are as good as the first, this series become one of the 'Greats' in the fantasy genre.
0545265355|5.0|I rented the books from the library before buying them. They are excellent books that you can't put down. Full of surprises!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's played like Jewel Quest Solitaire where you can select the card one  digit higher or lower than the draw card  and you try to clear all of the cards.  Try it!  I know you'll like it!
0142000655|5.0|I love Steinbeck, but know he's not for everyone. If you like writing that moves fast, then I don't recommend this. This is a story that can be slow at times, but not boring.

0307352145|5.0|I think everyone should read this book. It's informative and eye-opening. It helps introverts to understand themselves more and extraverts to be more generous and sympathetic with their &#34;quiet&#34; friends/family

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Although I was caught up by the beginning of this book with the protagonist revisiting his childhood, the story soon became too weird and morbid for my taste. It certainly is interesting, unusual, and I did finish the book.

1878424319|5.0|I have been trying to adhere to the four agreements ever since I first read this book ten years ago. I have been far from perfect in adhering to the &#34;agreements&#34; but I reread the book every few months to remind myself of their validity and common sense. Each of the four is very easy to say, but much harder to do! The author talks about the preconditioning humans have from birth up through adulthood. Some of our habits and values are good, while other thoughts and behaviors get us into trouble. Many of our thoughts, good and bad, are subconscious, and we're unaware what they do to us or for us. This book helps to make those distinctions. And, it's the kind of self-help book I like, too, for another reason....it has very few pages and large print! So, you can read it in a short period of time. Great guides for living.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is fun and gets harder each floor you gain. Keeps your mind spinning. Good mind exercising game. I totally recommend this game.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A four star for great acting as usual from Denzel Washington. Anyone would enjoy its powerful grip on such disturbing reality.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game has taught my daughter to play bingo, and the fun you can have when you win and collect the object's.
B00AQ2G7D6|3.0|This was OK but I expected more from Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen. Enjoyed the newer version with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan much more. Still, worth watching just for a taste of the 60s!
B003QSMC18|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE.  NEEDED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE ON VACATION.  HAVE IT SAVED ON THE TV.  TO WATCH WHEN I FEEL THE URGE FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN VIOLENCE.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was a sad story but rivoting at the same time. Finished in 2 days  surprised at ending. Read it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it. I does get pretty intense though, but reading this book definitely wasn't a waste of time considering I hardly ever read.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Awesome game for the price. I have bought this game on several devices, I would recommend it to everyone. A must buy!
0062255657|5.0|I am such a Gaiman Fangirl that I suspected I would love The Ocean at the End of the Lane, but what I ended up feeling after closing this novel was something beyond that emotion. Enraptured, entranced, enthralled...yes, all of those, and complete, total adoration. The Ocean at the End of the Lane exceeded my expectations on every level.<br /><br />I always expect something different and otherworldly when reading a Gaiman young adult novel, and this one is no exception. Told from the viewpoint of a seven-year-old boy (whose name we never learn), it's the story of a summer when a houseguest commits suicide on the farm of a mysterious trio of females. The young man becomes involved with the eleven-year-old girl who lives on the farm, and together they embark on an adventure that leads to an odd creature escaping its confines through the boy, and the desperate fight to get rid of the creature as it wreaks havoc on the boy's home life. All of this plays out in a magical fantasy filled with lovely descriptions and colorful environments that are as creepy as they are intriguing. The ending is perfection; heck, the whole book is!<br /><br />If you've never read a novel by Neil Gaiman, definitely take the time to search out The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It's true that it's a fantasy, but underneath are the common feelings we all experience and the characters we all recognize. This is a slim book that packs a wonderful, fantastic tale that I will want to revisit time and again.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|In a small town.  It was not so much about who had done the egregious deeds but the horrible secrets of a family's past that led to the present day murders.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|*** A minor spoiler (or two) here ***<br /><br />Why 5 star and a title \\"not the movie I thought it would be?\\"  Because I went in with the notion that it was a relationship between a man and a tiger.  But as the story unfolded I was drawn into the movie.  Sure the scene(s) of animals suffering are hard, but this is reality.  What do you expect when a zebra falls 20+ feet - a broken leg!<br /><br />Putting that aside, I was most surprised about the twist at the end of the movie (and I'm not giving anything away here).  All I can say is for those who didn't like the movie - I think you missed the core plot.  This movie resulted in a lengthy family discussion about the various symbolism and metaphors relating to life.<br /><br />Imagine being isolated at sea for over 200 days in a similar situation and you might very well come out with a similar story.<br /><br />So, I give it a 5 star rating because it was thought provoking, unexpected and had all of us engaged throughout the movie.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Roberto and cast were great...  I always felt like this film made the most of its story with superb acting and wonderful direction.  Excellent!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A friend told me about this book years ago and I've stil re-read my copy over and over. It's message is simple, yet powerful!
B009WUBERW|5.0|A fun movie to watch.  All the &#34;old timers&#34;  fighting the bad guys.  I enjoyed it. not much else to say.
0553381695|3.0|Its actually fairly common that a second book doesn't hold up to the fireworks of a great first book, and this one is no different.  I did enjoy the book, but had to slog through portions of it that didn't really seem to serve much purpose and, eventually, I started skimming portions...which is never a good sign.<br /><br />Honestly, there were simply too many switches in points of view and some of those didn't lend much to the plot and I didn't care about the characters after a while.  The Tyrion and Arya chapters were terrific and compelling, but Cat Starks's were boring and mostly filled with names, banners, knight of this and knight of that, and I frankly lost track after a while.  Her story only seemed to pick up once she hooked up with the Lady Knight (another favorite character and why didn't SHE get her own pov?).  Most of the rest fell somewhere in the middle, including that of Jon Snow...who is otherwise one of my favorites.  Bran's was interesting at times, but I quickly got pretty sick of Theon Greyjoy in this book.  Too bad.<br /><br />In this book, it seems like everyone is vying for the Iron Throne, specifically the two headliners, the former King's brothers.  On the other hand, Joffrey is still polishing it himself, backed up by his mother and the whole Lannister clan.  I still am loving to hate King Joffrey and I can't wait to see him get his...as he most likely will, since that seems to happen fairly often in these books.<br /><br />Jon Snow is wandering around north of the Wall and gets himself into trouble due to his warm-heartedness and sense of honor.  Tyrion finds he has it within himself not just to love again, but to find his bravery (or desperation) to protect King's Landing.  While, Arya continues her journey towards becoming a true warrior and survivor.  Even as the Mother of Dragons continues her quest to protect herself, her \\"children\\" and find a way back to Westeros to reclaim the throne that is more rightfully hers.  One can see the pieces slotting into place for later books.<br /><br />Once again, I revel in hating the Lannisters, in cheering for those prickly Starks, in adoring the silver-haired Mother of Dragons and her charges, but find the rest devolving into a mess of way too many characters and way too many houses and some of the nastiness just seemed to be there to be nasty.<br /><br />Sadly, the HBO show is actually turning out to be better in some respects than the books because they are tightening up the stories where they really do need tightening.  If an editor had cut about 200-300 pgs of this book it might have been a better book.  As it is, not bad...but it is difficult at times to slog through it all and not get lost or bogged down and lose track of who is who and what is what.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Our DVR had to be replaced and when we got the new one I did not reprogram &#34;Suits&#34; and did not release it until this season started and we did not have a clue what was going on!  We have Amazon Prime and were able to watch all the episodes we had missed FREE!
B006QSL9XC|4.0|...you really should watch Ken Burns' &#34;The Civil War&#34; first for added context. It's not absolutely necessary, but it will dramatically enhance your viewing experience of this film. Also, be prepared to have lots of popcorn on hand...&#34;Gettysburg&#34; is over 4 hours long.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Leading off with The Veldt sucks you right in to this album, the first few tracks are classic Joel with the later tracks definitely being more experimental and unique - but it all works together well and all Mau5 fans will be satisfied with the outcome.  Do wish there was a pure instrumental version of the The Veldt on the album minus the vocals.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The only downside is there is no way to get lots of free diamonds. You need these to keep playing so you have to wait for them to accumulate. Instructions for game need to be more detail and have a way for you to search features and what they are for and purpose of them. My other complaint is the time it takes to rebuild your energy (1 energy every three minutes). Tthe first 40 - 50 levels move relatively fast. After that they take forever. At level 91 to get your maximum energy restored it takes 47 and half hours for it to build on its own (energy level at 91 is 950 max). Yes you can earn items to help it build faster or buy things etc. and I understand they want to make money. It really gets ridiculous, as they should (the higher level you go) start making it take less time to reaccumulate energy. Even if you earn certain items to give you more energy or make it reaccumulate faster, a lot of the items can only be used every so often or so many a day. For example you can get Golden Phoenixes and use those all you want, but the Copper ones are limited to two a day and only last 30 minutes each (not enough time to rebuild any significant amount of energy). Then the cookies you get to use for energy (you are awarded those for completion of task/quest) you are only allowed to use 20 a day (they are worth 5 energies so you get to use a total of 100 energies despite the fact you may have 3,000 cookies in your inventory!! Could be a really neat game without all the limitations and time taken to rebuild energy levels. (Energy level increases by 10 each time you level up.........not sure if there is a stopping point or cap). Game Insights customer service sucks.
B004GGM444|3.0|Too many remixes of the same songs over and over again on this album, not enough original work.  you pay for really 4 songs on the whole album.  it's okay but want more originals on a full lengh album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i think this game is really fun but I want more levels so I can continue playing! I would recommend this game to anyone
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Took many listens, was put off by how different the album was at first - but it steadily gained my liking and now the only problem I have with the album is that there isn't enough of it.  Daft Punk has done it again.
B000002L68|5.0|I have been seriously into music since day one and I honestly don't know of any other  musical artist who is more versatile than PRINCE RODGERS NELSON, when you listen to his albums you hear POP, ROCK, FUNK, R&B and at times even GOSPEL and the way he fuses these groups of sounds together blurs the lines between them. PRINCE is raw undiluted talent itself!!!.<br /><br />His song writing abilities is almost second to none, some times fierce, his lyrics are based on philosophy, politics, religion and the sexual experience.<br /><br />He is also a multi instrumentalist.<br /><br />Then listen to his vocal arrangements, especially his screams, they sound so primal, so animalistic, he sometimes sounds like a creature stripped of all the essence of his humanity!!!.<br /><br />PURPLE RAIN is PRINCE'S greatest effort,with stunning vocal and instrumental arrangements, from the thought provoking intro in \\"LET'S GO CRAZY\\" to the well crafted rock/ballad \\"PURPLE RAIN\\", this superb album is indeed insanely perfect!!!. In-between these all the amazing cuts are: The pounding \\"TAKE ME WITH YOU\\", \\"THE BEAUTIFUL ONES\\", a soft classic rock, \\"COMPUTER BLUE\\", real heavy hitter here, \\"DARLING NIKKI\\", an eerie sexual adventure!. Now comes my absolute favorite Prince record, I think \\"WHEN DOVES CRY\\" is His greatest song yet, this one is truly well done in every single way, long and sweet. Another favorite is the swift \\"I WOULD DIE FOR YOU\\", stunning. Next is the rocking \\"BABY I'M STAR\\".<br /><br />This is certainly one of the most essential albums of the eighties and of all time and one of the most recommended. PURPLE RAIN is indeed a must have, no matter your musical taste it is here for you. It is as modern as it is a classic!!!.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Quickly lets me know what the weather is right now and the prediction for the day. There is more if you want it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I already love the movie(s), but wanted my own copy rather than trying to find it on tv. Used DVD arrived looking practically brand new and well packaged. No issues.
B005544V6A|5.0|It was great watching it straight through.  I didn't start watching Suits until mid season and was great I was able to watch the beginning.  The quality on my computer was great and it I stopped it resumes where I left off.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Very fun and fast paced. It is great trying to beat your own records. Does start to get redundant but still hours of playtime.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love suits and it is great that I can watch it straight through.  The quality on the computer was great
1476735115|5.0|I love this series. Howey put a new flavor and a outlook on dystopian novels. His view is unique. Wool mostly tells the story of Jules who reminds me of a Joan of Arc and Winston from 1984. Try this book out and then go on to the next part.
B00005JA8B|5.0|The movie came quickly just as I expected. I watched the movie as soon as i got it going to be buying more movies soon
B00454U1NS|4.0|All her music is fabulous.  The lyrics of each song have a message for everyone.  She says what she thinks without a muzzle.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|It was way too long and the story line was all over the map. This confirms my opinion that the Hollywood is running out of good<br />material.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and makes you think outside of the box. Just wish there were more rooms to go further. Level 10 was the hardest.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This was an unexpectedly beautiful series to watch. The landscapes were incredible. The characters were witty and sweet (especially Twister). Finally a show I could watch and feel good about.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A great book and very knowledgeable when it comes to working out in the gym. A must for people who want results and a healthy life style. I enjoyed the book so much bought the shred cookbook and now started the 1 year challenge from Michael Matthews.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Good Quick read. It was very entertaining for me :) I would recommend it to anyone. So try it :)
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Would be nice to see non-Apple versions available. Maybe by the time I wrote this review they are, but at the time, I couldn't find one. It works, so that's the main part, but like most apple product, it was overpriced by 2x. That's worth it on a sleek slim laptop or user-stupid-easy phone, but a silly adapter?
B00B49GSOS|5.0|This movie, especially with the riddles in the cave with Golem, reminded me of the book and made me want to read it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played . At first I thought it would suck<br />Because I had never played this game before and as soon as I played it I loved<br />Now I'm a pro
6305537321|5.0|Having read the novella first, I knew George Peppard could not come across as &#34;gay&#34; and he didn't.  The rest of his character was very similar to the book; he was protective of Holly and very kind.  The ending was completely different from the book, but, &#34;that's Hollywood.&#34;
B005VT42BS|5.0|This tool is a must for all IT tech should work on computer and net works as well as wireless
B004HWYTP4|5.0|You don't have to be over 50 to love RED but it helps. The humor is great, the action fun and the violence is actually minimized. Willis is at his best and Malcovich shows a zany side.<br />I hadn't seen it and watched as a \\"tune up\\" for the opening of RED2 - which was great!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved solitaire. This version is a lot better than the older version of it I downloaded last year
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I liked it all! A great read! Recommending it to all friends. Plan to reread it sometime, perhaps on the next long flight.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Steven Pinker turns his formidable mind to the phenomenon of violence throughout human history and the somewhat surprising evidence of its decline. From statistics to neurobiology to cultural influences, Pinker leaves no stone unturned yet another brilliant work of eminently readable analysis. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoy playing escape games but I enjoyed this more than others I have played.  I found myself anticipating each and every puzzle, looking forward to each new item revealed with each puzzle solved.  Great entertainment.  I look forward to the next episode.
B00DW36G32|4.0|I was SO surprised by this movie.  The acting was very good, the scenery was beautiful and the story was such that it really made you think afterwords.  Not because it was confusing, but because of the moral implications, etc.  I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone.  Some of the fight scenes are a bit graphic, so just be aware.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|Blu-ray works great but I always buy the dvd/blu-ray packs so the kids can watch in their rooms or on the road in their players. The dvd looks fine but doesn't work at all. Case also came warped and doesn't close, almost like it was heated up and began melting. Didn't spend a ton of money on it and in all fairness I never contacted the seller but we were pretty bummed about the dvd, the case we can live with.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The amount of creatures and the variety of different interactions between them is too much for my tiny mind.<br />Managed to read it to the end, but with no pleasure in doing it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is so entertaining to watch. I enjoy this program so much and am waiting anxously awaiting the next season.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I like that the movie didn't follow Hollywoods&#34;programmed&#34; model for Sci/Fi. Dialog was well written and executed. I enjoy a well placed F bomb, there were just enough. We don't need movie's to shield us from day to day language. I watch them to escape. Weapons and set were awesome, I like the sensuality/Brutality mix. Also, not a love story only. Yes there is a romantic sub-plot but it doesn't over power theme and adds depth and meaning to story line. Well played!
0375507256|5.0|Read it. Buy it and read it. Don't really need to watch the movie, just READ IT. And all of Mitchell's other works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My family all enjoy the game. Just wish it would let more than one player play per devise. That is have player enter name then play.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There are no wasted words in this story. This is one that will stay with me, I loved it. Buy it. Now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|just really fun and addicting. don't really have a single complaint... animations-great, simple, no delays or glitches :) the minions are cute for any age and its just plain adorable!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|For the most part I do not like most of today's country music, preferring the stuff of the 50's and 60's, but Garth always comes through with great feeling and easy listening.  This album just puts all of his greatest songs into one place.
B000FA675C|5.0|It had me from open to close... loved it!!  Bought the othe Langdon books immediately after I finished it... can''t wait to read the next...
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|WHAT I WOULD LOVE IS IF THESES GUYS WOULD JUST PUT OUT NOTHING BUT A HARD AS HELL METAL MASTERPIECE !!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is the bomb dot com. It is super realistic for the time period it is placed in and always keeps you on your toes.
B007HU4FZ2|4.0|I can't imagine being alive in those dark times. This was a startling re-enactment that certainly activated my capacity for compassion.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|This movie was terrific!  Barbara Streisand is a very good actress & her portrayal of the Mom was spot on.  The relationship between the Mom & son was 'gender' neutral & we laughed throughout the movie.  Some of the out takes at the end hilarious.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well-written by a skeptic (former skeptic).  It gives all of us hope.  It is a beautiful account of his experience.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|...puts me in the right mental space. &#34;Get Lucky&#34; is a chilled laid back song. Great for the summer and beyond.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|The Bates Motel series inspired me to watch this classic movie again. I only saw it once about 20 years ago, but 30 years ago I went on the tour of Universal Studios and never forgot this house. The trailer with Alfred Hitchcock is really interesting, you can't imagine them doing a trailer like this that many years ago. Definitely worth buying to keep in your movie library!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging, causing you to rack your brain to solve this problem. It keeps your brain moving by problem solving.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome app for mtg players.  Would be fun if you can scan the actual card and can play it here =p...
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Cable will not charge my iPhone. It was tried on another iPhone, still no charging power. Looked identical  original  cord.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is super fun and requires little maintenance and money. I would think with time only you should be able to buy anything!
B00CMB8MXC|5.0|I loved the film and the music is music that makes me smile. For those need to be happy days.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this movie. When I first watched it a few years ago, I wanted it. I watched on tv the other day with my younger sister, and now she loves it.
0913866156|5.0|I got this for a friend and worried pretty much until he opened it that something would be wrong with it, but nope! IT was exactly what was wanted and turned out to be the perfect gift. The &#34;gift packaging&#34; was neat and not revealing as to what it could be and it arrived promptly on time when it was scheduled to.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed solving this puzzle,this game is more than I expected it to be.I hope the designers make another game of this type.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This movie gave me nightmares. But in a good way. I think it's actually a great drug prevention film! Super twisted plot.
B005HSL626|5.0|I am really really addicted. This is the greatest game ever. In my top five of best games. It's up there with dinner dash.
B006L4MX0Y|5.0|This is the movie that in my opinion and many others is the spiritual inspiration behind the hunger games. Quentin Tarantino is quoted on this saying this is the movie he wish he made. The basic story is that the youth are being blamed for the downturn of Japan and in a last-ditch effort to try and bring back some order to these unruly young upstarts they've enacted the Battle Royale Act. What follows is a incredibly wild and crazy journey as the students of a lucky class are pitted against each other to survive. Who can you trust, who is going to crack, who is going to make it? The story keeps you engaged seeing just what will happen to everyone, and trust me when I say it is far more brutal and graphic than what you'll see from the Hunger Games movie that came out. Highly recommend this if you're interested at all by the premise or are a fan of the hunger games.
B00005K3O4|5.0|the movie was awsome remember it as i did when i was a lil girl My son loved it too
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I thought this would be a game my grandson could play but it's more of a learning item, very informative
B0091REZMW|3.0|Kind of good yet kind of boring. Need ways to earn rewards faster because getting energy uses most of them. There are none left to do other things.
1608871827|5.0|\\"Pacific Rim\\": My humble movie review - It's the best \\"Cthulhu vs Mecha\\" movie... EVER!! 5 tentacles UP!! Really, the only thing wrong with \\"Pacific Rim\\" is that the movie goes by too fast. The monsters and robots, are so strange, and wonderful, and amazingly well designed, I wanted to see MORE... that is why I bought the book \\"Pacific Rim: Man, Machines & Monsters\\". It gives you every monster from sketch through to fully rendered image. Plus, all the back story ideas of why they look like that. What powers each Lovecraftian creature has. What weakness. What's their alien-monster-god goals? Did you know the monster \\"Otachi's\\" tail could come off and fight on it's own?! Yes, all the monsters have names! The robots too. Each with different powers. It's a beautifully made book; 156 pages packed full of art, plus ID cards for the robot (Jaeger) pilots, plus stickers of the Robot's insignia, plus an envelope in the back that holds two fold out propaganda posters. All the art you pass by so quickly in a movie, Monsters, armor, sets, costumes, storyboards, everything... you can look at as long as you want, in this book. Read about the \\"journey of design\\" each \\"thing of Art\\" took. Guillermo del Toro, an artist himself, fully documents his movies. I have the amazing \\"Art of\\" books from both Hellboy movies. However, this is even bigger and better. There is so much information squeezed into the movie, I don't know if I would have enjoyed it WITH OUT the book explaining all the things I wanted to know about this world, about this adventure. PLUS, like all Guliimero Del Toro movies, \\"Pacific Rim\\" has \\"heart\\". The characters have goodness in them. There's horror, but also humor. You like the characters. You don't leave the theater feeling tainted, but \\"up and excited\\"; like you stepped off a thrill ride - a great \\"ghost-train\\" ride. And the book tells you all about each and every thrill you had, and many others you missed on the first viewing.l you had, and many others you missed on the first viewing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is interesting and great fun for my son as he loves it so. Could make it less gem oriented though as I'm not going to buy them often enough to be of use.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I truly enjoy Sylvia and all her books. The Crossfire series were the first of her books that I've read and loved them! I can't wait for the next one in this series!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|first of the game was really fun but after I got to the hotel it kicked me back to main menu. even thou I bought the full version.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This is a new series for me. I've never read any of Thea's books but she is a very good writer. I really enjoyed the characters. I was a little out of element with identifying the different races but after awhile I got used to them. I'm looking forward to reading the next one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|when will the next update be out ive been waiting too long its a great game over all thx mojang
B001NA6096|5.0|I read several reviews of the newst movie in this series and wanted to see bothe of them before seeing<br />Before Midnight.Ihad never seen a film with this precept. Priarily tow people and the relationship formed in such a short time. Loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love challenging my brain. This is fun, and is teaching my children to think outside the box. More rooms please!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Although the Pilot was a little Cheezy, I do like the fast pass action and eclectic scenarios the writers gin up.  If you are into action intense drama this series is for you.  Also, if you like constant one liners and one-ups this is also for you.  If you don't like any of those, well, this won't be something you enjoy.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|The movie arrived on time and was as the seller represented it.  We're very happy.  My kids love this movie and are excited to own it!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Superb writing, wonderful plotting, characterisation and narrative. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It gives a lot of food for thought as far intelligence services go.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I love this app!  I don't have to write things down and since I take my kindle every where any way...I have shopping lists and notes where ever I go!
0804165734|5.0|All good,as expected. The product was exactly was was described in the (product description). It arrvied on time and without any damage whatsoever.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Sure, they want to sell you stuff, but the game itself isn't limited... you just have to play longer.  Thats the way to make a microtransaction game.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I really like this app.  It is so easy to use. I like how easy it is to find any videos.
1616615362|5.0|the Slave 1 expansion adds some great playability to the game.  Anyone who plays as Imperials wants to take the Fett-man out and kick some rebel scum.  points for points, this expansion packs a punch.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Awkward is awesome! This show kept me wanting to watch another episode again and again and again. Really glad I gave it a try.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry is better than ever. A tightly written murder mystery that kept me connected.  Well written and delivered by Connelly.
B00481UAHA|5.0|This is probably the best album Garner ever put out, and he made a lot! I heartily recommend it !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a fantastic book! I put it on my Kindle and couldn't put it down! A great read for the romantic at heart!!!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|My first &#34;Clancy&#34; in over 5 years. Typical deep dive into the techno-stuff, but that's the trademark. Timely premise. A bit convoluted at times. Glad it was not just a &#34;cover&#34; for a video game, as were some before.  All-in-all an enjoyable summer read along with a valid message.<br /><br />Pete
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have tons of 35MM slides from the 50's and 60's that would be of little value to me without this simple, but effective scanner.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is one of the best movies I have seen in my life! Watched twice! :D
B000I5X82E|5.0|great album, would recommend, I just heard them on HBO and fell in love.  I had never heard them before, actually, I had heard them, just didn't know who they were since the radio stations don't give out names anymore......like the good old days.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book is ok but I enjoyed his first 2 novels much more than this one. I found the book too fragmented.
0345803507|2.0|Very disappointing!!! A lot of sex but a very weak story line!! It's like the author rushed thru this last book and didn't give it much thought at all.. This book was given a safe, white picket fence, middle class America ending...
0679809015|5.0|This book is so cute - my 14 month old likes to life the flaps to see what's under there.  We also look at and talk about other things on the page and sometimes I reverse the questions (i.e. \\"What does a cow say?\\" vs. \\"Who says moo?\\") to change it up a little.  It's a SMALL book - maybe 3-4\\" square.  But it's perfect for the diaper bag and since she likes it so much that's perfect.  You need something they're interested in if you have to resort to a book when you're out and about!
B006P0FIGU|3.0|I actually like the other Three Musketeers better but this one was not bad. Different. Had a different ideas on how it was gonna be.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I enjoy using this program to help keep my mind active and stimulated.  There is plenty if variety is the 9 segments and I can get more than enough of a mental workout.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read this book twice love it. I will finish the books then keep them in my library for future reading
B00CF34B2I|4.0|:) Magic as it should be. Accept the controlled are hard to use at times. Good job Wizards of The Coast.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cinematography, costumes, characters, dialogue it's all so wonderfully put together! Just wish they wouldn't have the incredible drama that makes you wish you hadn't fallen in love with Downton in the first place! (No spoilers here.)
1454704225|5.0|I just got this wonderful book in the mail yesterday!  I LOVE IT!!  This book provides very simple but fun and creative activities for art journals, mixed media ideas, or just do doodle!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I used to be able to download videos in HD. After the latest update many videos are not downloading in HD.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best app I've ever bought, by far. You get to use your brain power, memory, and problem solving skills to the maximum. There are all of those reviews not liking it as much, saying it needs more chapters. Those people relied on the hints too much. If you want to get your money's worth, then don't use them at all. Trust me, it's possible to figure out through time.<br /><br />Perfect graphics, perfect sound, great puzzles, and a fantastic storyline. Very great app, I have no complaints, and I'm actually trying to think of some.<br /><br />I'm not even expressing my love for it well enough, get the app. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I thought this was another action/mystery novel.  I never would have purchased it, if I had know it was a romance novel. Please consider reclassifying this.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter never fails to entertain.  Always keeps you guessing whats to come next.  The final season iks going to be fantastic.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great writing. good story line. interesting characters with never a dull moment. Didn't know how it was going to end until the end.
B007DIQC90|4.0|My brother recommended this download because, although we like similar music, I haven't bought a ton of music lately and he thought I'd like it. I did. Easy to listen to and catchy harmonies and lyrics. I set up a Pandora station and &#34;discovered&#34; The Lumineers and Mumford and Son's.  Ordered a download of each of those, but haven't listened yet. Fun stuff.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I have had this book for years and hadn't gotten around to reading it because it's paper and I now own a Kindle. I wish I had read it sooner! I have my own personal tragedy and reading about Alice and how she handled her rape made me feel more normal in the way I have dealt with my tragedy. I highly recommended this book. It's thoughtful and very well written. I feel a certain sense of relief having read her story.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great show, continued in the second season. If you liked the first one then jump right in you wont be disappointed!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|After losing my first Voyager because of setting it down while in a store(I prefer not to wear it all the time) I found this case. Works great. Keeps it secure and is relatively durable. Good product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive! Fun game for the whole family.love despicable me.favorite movie of all time.I love this game is sweet and very fun.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a fascinating look at the role of introverts in our world. It has opened my eyes to why I was so uncomfortable during high school and college years and why I still have difficulty in certain situations. It's a great celebration of introversion in a world that rewards extroversion!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Emma Stone is absolutely brilliant & this movie is hilarious! Nothing life changing, but way better than your usual teen movies!
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandparents, who love to watch this movie. It is definitely a chick flick, and everytime I watch it, I pour tears. This is the type of movie you can watch again and again.
B009WUBERW|5.0|This is one fun rollercoaster ride with a group of misfits that get the job done, plus some great Action scenes that blow you away!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I like the movie but not quite as much as the book. It was very well done and it's entertaining.
B004P1JDJO|2.0|I learned some from this title.  He does well to discuss the intrinsic drive which is necessary to obtain great achievement, one which is separate from external, i.e., monetary drives, or biological drives.<br /><br />I didn't think much of are the authors' descriptions of professional athletes whom he claims possess great drives.  For example the author tells of the daily routine of \\"Tiger Woods, the best golfer that ever lived.\\"  As insiders know, Woods uses a \\"special driver\\" so that he can hit the ball past others on the tour, similar to the corked bats of some baseball players, a la Barry Bonds. I guess Mr. Pink forgot to take into consideration the occurrence of cheating in the pro ranks as he discusses drive.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Just like the other seasons, this has a great story line. The only down side at all is you have to like war stories, because they are constantly at war.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I bought this a while back it does charge the N10 faster than the micro-usb does with the same charger.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I use it all the time to send pictures on  email to send to friends and my friends enjoy my craze videos
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love love love. Very shocked at the end. I have watched every season. Can't wait for when the new season starts.
B000FA675C|2.0|Yes I'm Christian but that's not the point.  I could suspend disbelief of the subject matter -  but it wasn't the subject matter, it was the plot. I read this from a secular person's perspective, I didn't find it &#34;religiously offensive&#34; hence why I don't get the fuss. Anyways,  it started off pretty good to me- but the further along the main character went - the easier it got for him. By the time Sir Teabing came along - I had to make myself keep reading. Everything was happening too smoothly and the scene at the airport? The police not catching on like that? Blah. The only character I liked and who had a better, meatier story - was Silas. I did not like the writing style, either - but that's the way it is. Overall I found it pretty boring - except the Silas and Bishop Aringarosa parts. Funny, the &#34;bad guys&#34; had more substance.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|There were too many facts and descriptions that were provided that did not facilitate the flow of the story. Instead, they served as a distraction. The only way I was able to finish the book, was to read only the conversations and ignore most of the descriptions.
B002HL3PN4|4.0|Love the books, love the movies. Great story about courage and friendship. And It was easy to rent on Amazon...and cheaper than renting through Mediacom.
B0091WFNEG|5.0|Just back from Gettysburg 150th reenactment and wanted to re-watch the movie with that experience in mind.  The movie stands up to it.  Very moving with fine performances.  Have seen this film many times and it always gets to me, particularly Pickett's Charge.  The movie was filmed on actual locations, something the park does not usually allow.  A few battles (the Peach Orchard, for example) are omitted but the story line flows.  If you get the chance to see a reenactment, do it.  Then watch the movie.  The 150th was huge and even though the artillery were shooting &#34;blanks,&#34; the sound and smoke made me appreciate the movie in a deeper way.  Overall, I come away with a deep sadness for all who are soldiers of war.  Their experiences are something the rest of us will never know and can only begin to understand with movies like this.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is one of the best shows out there today for the family where both adults and kids can enjoy<br />Very funny very cute and very entertaining
0790742780|5.0|This movie is fun to watch when you've had a really bad day and have a very twisted sense of humor. Michael Douglas goes through Los Angeles and takes revenge on many of the stressors of average day to day life. From trashing the store of a Korean Grocery store owner who was overcharging him, to fighting back against gang members, and to confronting a lying panhandler, Douglas does many of things the average person thinks about doing to get back at the 'evils' of society. The ending of the movie makes the viewer really try to figure out who the 'good' and 'bad' guys really are!
B0044WSF5M|5.0|This movie brings back so many memories.<br />Such a simpler life in those times.<br />Only wish more drive ins were present.
B001974DG0|5.0|I read this book 25 years ago and loved it.  I decided I needed to read it again and purchased it on Kindle!  It was every bit as entertaining the second time as the first time.  I have read many more of Dean Koontz's books, but this one is far and away my favorite!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I thought the camera might make picture taking w/ the kindle easier/more like other tablets & cameras. So, basically it sucks. I don't enjoy using this camera & will not use it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I was impressed by the number of songs on this CD that were really worth listening to.  Most CD's have one or two good songs with the rest being fillers, but this CD is good all the way through.  The band is musically tight.  I can almost see them on stage when listening to the CD.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Citizen Kane was an class assignment as well.  But I found it very interesting, in how they set-up the movie.  When it opens it of him taking his last breath, and then the story begins of his life.  He was a very ambitious man that wanted it all his way, because he felt his way was the best.  Some time we must look introspectively when looking at the mean of person(s).
B004JRVQX0|5.0|No problems, no issues. As described. Has been working great since I got it over a year ago. Sort of a necessity for Pro Tools
B000YMMN04|5.0|There was more in this movie that had an underline meaning, whereas, we should be more of an awareness that everything and everyone is not black nor white.  And we should make room for the in between.
B009JZVT70|5.0|A nice spin on familiar stories. If you read, stories begin to become predictable. I like when I can't constantly predict what happens next in a story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I enjoyed the Avengers! this movie takes you out of this world into the world of adventure.  I look forward to the next event of the Avengers...
0451418441|5.0|It is an engrossing tale of the middle ages.  It depicts war as well as the lives of the surfs, peasants and religious and nobility.  I found I could not put it down and had to limit my reading time or nothing else would get done
B000HAB4KS|4.0|This is my all famous movie.  I wrote on this movie for the written communications class, (funny enough) I was looking at the biblical contexts and meanings as well the philosophical contents.  I enjoy all of the Matrixes' movies looking for more!!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Too little content; small event  belabor(u)ed without end.<br />But a fun way to expand my knowledge of idiomatic British language.
B000U55YIS|5.0|f you like music of the 80th this is the one to have as well. I had LP in the 80th and was happy to by it again. Really good music for the dance party. I was going with my friends after dinner and put this CD in they have never heard it before, they were jumping up and down and in the morning asked what was it, said they are going to buy it
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Awesome app puts me to sleep with the sounds of the ocean and seagulls throw in some crickets and your counting sheep
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love Downton Abbey. I am always transported back in time while watching each episode. I just can't get enough of Downton Abbey.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|Not as good as I hoped for because:  too much bad language (F-bombs) and the big ending was a let down:  the whole movie was about whether the old quartet would join together again and sing a famous song from their past glory.  The final scene set up that as a climax, but incredibly, the singing was off-screen and no audience reaction was shown.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I chose Downton Abbey season 2 because I just couldn't get enough of this wonderful series. I just didn't want the time spent with staff and family to end.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|Vonnegut's work was unfamiliar to me and this book was not at all what I expected. I guess it can be said that Slaughterhouse-Five certainly makes you think but the story, to me, is not fulfilling.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Overall, this was a great season, felt more &#34;Dexter&#34; like than the past few seasons.  Worth the watch for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The minions are one of my favorite things about Depicable Me.  I downloaded this for my daughter and she has been enjoying playing it immensely.
B009A9SULS|4.0|I received a Kobo Mini for Xmas (2012), and I've read on it pretty much every night since then. I wanted a basic, e-ink, not backlit (or sidelit) reader that was lightweight and easy to use. At the time, the Mini was a less expensive option than the basic Kindle and the basic Nook. I've been quite happy with the Mini. Battery life is excellent (I leave the WiFi off unless I'm updating it), and it weighs next to nothing. I have no problem reading on it while in bed. The page size is pretty much on par with the average paperback books, and it does have the capacity to adjust fonts and sizes. Have about 800 books on it right now, and still nearly half of the storage space is open. Cons: It can be a bit slow when organizing one's books. I use Calibre to manage my e-books, which makes management for the Kobo a breeze. I can't say I like dealing with the Kobo company very much, but since this reader takes basic epub format, I have been able to side-load my epub books without any problems. It does have a couple of game-type apps, which I don't use at all. Surfing the web is possible, but - as with any basic e-reader - rather cumbersome to execute. I have a Kindle Fire for tablet use and light e-reading, but reading on a backlit screen gives me a headache -- plus Amazon's major screw-up in failing to provide users with an on-board means of organizing our books makes me less inclined to rely on the Fire for reading. I'd give it 5 stars if there were external navigation buttons.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Downloaded this game because my daughter and I both love dragons and I figured it would give us something that we could play together.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it to much that is so hard to let it go! It's so fun and interesting that with out thinking you can become so addictive to it!  :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fantastically fantastical fatastic awsome chair of the spirit and in the trap of a new profile pic this is a contest for the last Sunday
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I think this should be shown in every Junior High and High School to both girls and boys. Young boys and girls are making children right and left and have no clue as to the impact neglect and bad choices have on them.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This is the 2nd Nesbo I have read in a week. They are the best: action, details and addictive. Will wait until tomorrow to begin another.
B001DE29SS|5.0|R. Downey should have gotten the Best Actor award. He was right on as Chaplin. I would have liked to see at the end what his children are doing.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle season five it was better in I was expecting I love it when Kate Beckett slapped the senator with her gun upside her his head liked the ending very well so for this I have to give it five stars.
B0099114WO|3.0|I was told this was hilarious. It was amusing in parts but certainly not &#34;hilarious&#34;. Maybe because I'm a &#34;senior&#34;.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|Beyond disappointing! Shallow, uninformed, uninspired, uninspiring and ...... pretentious. As others have already said nothing new and the author has a lot to learn.<br /><br />I started an accounting career with Arthur Andersen in the mid 70s, then on to a governors budget office and next administration of a social service agency while a single mother of 2 for 17 years. The author has a lot to learn about how change happens.<br /><br />Read Jean Shinoda Bolen instead!
B00CC1JXYE|2.0|For the price of $40.00 you would think this case would be alot more solid built. Not at all. It's super thin and cheap looking. I am always concerned that the screen cover never stays in place or shut and defeats the whole purpose of protecting the phone.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|If you want your screen to show true color you need this. This made a huge differance for me. My wallpaper at the time of setup was of the night sky. At first I thought it was making my color dull but then I went outside and looked at the real night sky. It was spot on. Later that week I went shopping for a new TV and I noticed that they all have there color set up way to bright. It will make everything on your computer easier to see and more comfortable to the eye. If you have more than one monitor it will match them up. Great for gaming, working, or watching.
B0000669JL|5.0|If you're just starting into the Marley family sound (better late than never), this is the perfect &#34;opener&#34;.  It's my Friday trip to the beech-- just settin' on the porch after work and having a frosty cold one.  It has the same mental effect in winter, but NOT on the porch.<br /><br />You can also take many of the lyrics seriously, and because this is just a stone's throw away from hip-hop, it can be the basis for some nifty political discussions with teeners.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I'm a big fan! I think Castle and Beckett have a wonderful chemistry. He's a wise ass but not to the point of being irritating. She has a wonderful coolness about her. The rest of the crew, Kevin, Javier, Lanie, seem so natural together. The interplay between Castle and his daughter Alexis is so sweet. Susan Sullivan, playing Martha, has been around forever and she looks fabulous.  The plots can be fomulaic, but it's the interaction that we watch for. I especially love when Castle thinks that the perpetrator is an alien being or vampire or some other loony crackpot; while he goes off on a tangent, Becket brings him back down to earth. The dialogue makes the show...the wise cracks, the goofy remarks...i.e. &#34;Guess who's got a date with a hooker?&#34;  just make the show very enjoyable.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|How did he manage to bring so many stories together into one coherent story? It was amazing and fascinating . . . .  i would certainly gladly read anything else he writes.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 3.y.o. daughter loves all the Dr. Panda apps.  This one was her favorite until the art class app came out.  She loved putting together broken furniture and house parts.  She uses a hammer, saw, paintbrush, and other tools to repair and refinish things.  It is a very basic easily understood game.
0525425772|5.0|I love all of John Grisham's  books and Theodore Boone: &#34;The Activist&#34; was not an exception.  Being brand new, it came in excellent condition.  I have a pre-order waiting right now for Mr. Grisham's next book due to be released in Oct., 2013.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved  the prior version. Ready to uninstall. I keep &quot;earning&quot; apps that are not available for my Kindle. It is also far less user friendly.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I downloaded this game when it was the free app of the day here on Amazon and I must say it's a GREAT game. I've played on LAN with my kids on my tablets and phones and they love it also. Unfortunately Bluetooth doesn't seem to work (button is greyed out even when bluetooth is on and paired) and on LAN it does seem a little laggy but overall it's a fun game and I've been playing for a few hours straight.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Reminds me of when i was a kid and played this for hours,now i play it with my kids and the tablets and cellphones,great game!
B0027DK206|4.0|i have a diana f + of course, this is for that lomo. it's hard at first since you need to balance everything with the camera. You'l need to have it on the B option and never place it on Pinhole since its gonna show up really dark... You also need to press the shutter button atleast 1-3 seconds to allow more light to come inside the lens. :)hope this helps
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie is by far the best of the new Bond movies. I would highly recommend it. If you are concerned about not having seen any of the other movies in this series don't worry too much. This movie can stand alone. I say it is a must watch even for non-Bond lovers.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Katherine<br /><br />After viewing Season 1 of American Horror Story my husband and I could not wait to watch Season 2. Sadly, we were pretty disappointed. We felt the writing was not as good as the first season, that the ties between present day and the past were not as well done as Season 1, and that the acting in the present day scenes was melodramatic and over the top. It also felt very much like many of the episodes were pointless and just filling time to get to the end of the season. While we enjoyed the performances of several actors, overall we felt the second season did not live up to expectations.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I guess this game IS compact enough to play on a palm-size screen.  Haven't played it for months, too much real world action.
1581804849|5.0|I will be using this book over and over.  It has great step by step directions and a wide variety of flowers.  I love the full color illustrations.  The only thing better would be a dvd!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|It's really difficult to play a game where instructions are impossible to locate.<br />I am also finding it difficult discovering how to uninstall apps on my Kindle Fire.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cool to play with my grandson makes him think on what order to do things in<br />and how thins work together
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|interesting enough to keep me awake while my grandson watches the orcs, wolves and trolls get eliminated.  He also likes the flying enemies.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Once I started watching the series, I couldn't stop.  It is truly well written and a deliciously complicated story.  Must watch!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Each season I set out to read a classic, challenging myself to read titles/ genre that I would not normally choose- this summer it was Dracula.<br />This was a fast paced book,,c constantly moving me forward. The only distraction was Van helsing's \\"voice\\".  I think Stoker attempted to make him sound like a foreigner; however, even with his awkward voice, his character remained endearing.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Haven't watched this full movie yet, but I plan on using it in my world history classes this year! Will update!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This CD was ourchased as a replacement to one that we lost.  It is a great CD; the music is classic and me & my husband LOVE it!<br /><br />The CD arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Would highly recommend this album/CD to anyone that is from the 50s, 60s, 70s.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie I watched it with my son and he was completely excited throughout be while thing.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|This movie is a lot differnet than movies now a days but it's one I loved as a child and enjoyed re-watching it now as an adult.
B004K00NMG|4.0|This movie has great picture quality, a good story, and fantastic music. Unfortunately due to having some not kid friendly scenes I took off a star.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks. Kids get to use their imaginations to make what they want . Awesome game get the app!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. Easy to learn, just by following the goals. Build organization &amp; management skills while having fun building your city just the way you like it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is great for any child and even adults. I sit on the app for hours with my son designing men and women's hairstyles. There are many other creative things you can add on their hair and face to make them look better. Toca Boca is always making great updates to this app. I highly recommend this game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a good app.  My son is quite concerned when bad weather moves in and this way he can keep track of things.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|it was a great movie i loved everything i wish th  movie was cheaper though but this movie was My#1 movie and i just absolutly loved it
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After downloading, each time I tried to open the app to play it froze the kindle & I had to shut down.  Deleted app after 2 hours
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is cool!!!!!!!! I hop there is a temple run 3 .If you not have if these git  IT!!!!!!!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I love this album... the price I got it for was a steal .. $5<br />All of the tracks are great...
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app freezes my kindle fire constantly.  Page is too busy and does not fit screen.  Why does this industry insist on fixing what is not broken?  Are you guys ex microsoft?
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Gossip Girl is a great chick flick kind of show, and if you got to season 6 then you already know it is going to be good.
B005HEJ2DK|3.0|Of the four seasons this one is the worst. They got sidetracked with a plot that involves an alien race(s) called the Xindi that makes you wonder why you should care. This was overly clever with five symbiotic (but not really) races of bad guys that in the end was two that were being deceived by yet another hidden race. This is the same thing that happened to Deep Space Nine. They became too clever and soon the viewer had no idea what race was what and didn't care. Finally in Season 4 of Enterprise they got back to exploring which was what their job was.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is an awesome show. Walking Dead will definitely suck you in, if you are interested in zombies/dramas/ etc. My only let down was Season 3 finale, was not as good as the season 2 finale.
B003PGNBO8|4.0|This is an excellent production with extras. MY only reason I did not give a full rating is that I wished the writers/producers had at least given the fans some sort of conclusion. Sadly it did not get picked up to continue the story and looks like it never will.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book was very interesting, and wasn't your typical book. The layout of the book made it easy and quick to read. A lot of thought and detail went into this book.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|This is an OK game that is very similar to others such as Galcon. It was fine for a free app but glad I didn't pay for it.
B004SIP7TE|4.0|I thought the movie would have ended a little different. I thought the fight should have been a little different. However, I like the suspense leading up to the climax of the movie!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like puzzles then this is the game for you. Good for brain practice for both memory and puzzle solving.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i like having this app. it is something i can use on the go. i don have to get my bible the app is righ on my tablet and easy to access
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I was never a fan of the original films. They were interesting but I was never captivated by them. This film I think is the best portrayal. It's definitely a &#34;must see&#34;.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Great Music, Great Price and Great Product.  I would purchase from this seller again, which I have.  Thank You again for having a great product with a low price. Thanks a Million
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Some movies are just too funny to pass up. This would be one of them. It's a must see for all
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Great Music, Great Price and Great Product.  I would purchase from this seller again, which I have.  Thank You again for having a great product with a low price. Thanks a Million
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie is possibly my favorite Phase 1 Marvel film. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. You won't be disappointed.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|These are great , perfect item for me. The product is well made and good quality. The product discribed was as indicated in the remarks. I will buy from this seller again in the future. Thanks A Million.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This movie is exciting. There is a twist a turn around every corner. It will easily become a classic. It's a movie you have to see at least once.
