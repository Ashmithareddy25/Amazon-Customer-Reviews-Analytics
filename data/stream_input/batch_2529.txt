0892818875|5.0|This is one of the few aroma therapy books written from the perspective of Chinese medicine.  It is totally invaluable.  I recommend it to any one who studies Chinese Medicine.<br /><br />Zinnia<br />Washington, DC

B005QMOZOO|5.0|P.D. James never dissappoints.  It is amazing to realize she wrote this book when she was 90 years old.  She has perfectly captured the feeling of a Jane Austen novel.  This is a tour de force.<br /><br />Zinnia<br />Washington, DC
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful read!  I simply could NOT put it down.  If you love WWII history, like I do, read it.  You won't regret it.

B009LGO88E|4.0|bought this expressly for monster hunter 3 ultimate, unfortunately: after playing for a while and then finally deciding to order this...by the time it got here i was so accustomed to using the touch pad that the circle pad pro really just got in my way. ive played monster hunter since the first on PS2, and played every release here in the states. at this point i just adapt quickly to whatever capcom tosses my way. tried to use it on resident evil revelations, but the new pad seemed a bit sensitive, maybe its a setting. at any rate for what the CPP does its a good deal at $20, but i wish i had owned it before i got used to all the games controls. hopefully ill use it in the future.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike Matthews' book is an incredible read, full of no BS advice that every person getting into shape NEEDS to know. From cutting to bulking to proper technique, he lays it all out in an easy and entertaining style. I even emailed Mike and he wrote back! This guy's the real deal. If you read anything on health and fitness in your life, make it BIGGER LEANER STRONGER.

B00BL5YQKS|4.0|First season is mostly based on story lines that end in 45 minutes. Towards the end you get some overarching plot lines. The main bad guy was pretty impressive. Good show!
B005T3AJBS|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers on this album. But while others do not like change I found the sound satisfied a long craving for some New, \\"Real\\" Rock. It is a cleaner, more \\"subdued\\" Janes Addiction. But while some did not like It I think it sounds Great. I have been listining to JA since highschool, 90s, and along with the Bands sounds changing so have my listening preferences. A sign of a good artist is being able to change and adapt thier art along with themselves.<br />  This Album almost sounds to me like a lost collection of JA from the 90's cleaned up and produced to give it a great contemporary sound. Perry does not give the crazy energy we are used to but sounds more somber and melancholy. This attitude gives the tracks a dark droning sound that makes you rock out more in your head feel. If you take the album as a whole this may be my favorite album yet. A must have for any JA,90s Rock fan.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Bought this for my son he loves this movie. Great to have it handy to watch it anywhere.  love amazon.
B002VXGW2E|2.0|Okay....I don't really \\"loath\\" the character Julie in this film, but I would have rather that the film had simply told Julia Child's life story.  I loved the parts of the film that dealt with Ms. Childs' life.  But the character Julie was a whiny, shallow, incompetent little girl who did nothing worthwhile, and said nothing the least bit interesting, insightful or entertaining. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, except as a soporific for insomniacs.
1400069807|4.0|I think anyone interested in health, fast food issues, or eating healthier should read it. Get up off the couch and grab a copy.

B005ZMTXMY|5.0|It's not often you realize the movie you're watching puts you in such good hands you can simply sit back, suspend judgement, and enjoy the ride. It's rarer still, when it's an animated picture. This film will speak to everyone watching it: the young or old, the deep or shallow, the frustrated or pleasant. \\"Up\\" is a movie will change your mood and give you perspective.

1250007208|5.0|I've book looking forward to reading this book for so long! I've always had a soft spot for retold fairy tales and I've heard nothing but good things about Cinder. As soon as I started reading it I was immediately hooked by the story and the wonderfully developed characters. So addicted that I read the entire thing in a day!<br /><br />Cinder is definitely a strong character who I immediately came to love. She's faced hardship throughout her entire life-well, the part that she can remember-not only because her stepmother dislikes her but because everyone has a prejudice against cyborgs. So much so that cyborgs are singled out to test the antidotes for the plague . . and none have survived. I love how Cinder continued to fight for herself and for what she wanted, even when it seemed like the entire world was against her.<br /><br />There are so many things going on in this book! Handsome Prince Kai, cyborg problems, the plague rising, people on the moon threatening war with the entire Earth. It's crazy, how many things are including and how wonderfully they all go together so that no part of it sounds absurd and the reader and is still left cheering Cinder on.<br /><br />I really can't wait to read Scarlet. I went into this book thinking that it would be fully concluded and that Scarlet was only a companion book but I was wrong; Cinder ends in a way that immediately leaves you clamoring for more. With an ending like that, I'm definitely picking up the next book as soon as I can.<br /><br />I give Cinder 5/5 stars and recommend it to all fairy tale lovers and people looking for a great, quick read.
B005SAYRA6|4.0|Best movie of the series, and it hasn't felt like it's stale or jumped the shark unlike fast 6 which feels tired.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|It's really sad people with the kindle fire are complaining that sometimes the free app doesn't work for them.  Guess what!  The app store and free app of the day predate the kindle.  Not every app is going to be for just the fire because the fire is a bare bones tablet.  Get over yourselves.<br /><br />This app is OK. It works and best of all it saves as a PDF which the stock camera can't do and sometimes you need a PDF not just an image.  It could be better, I wish it allowed text editing on images that were text based but it doesn't
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was better than I could have hoped for.  It was a long read and I almost had to take a day off to finish!  The story had good flow and the action seemed to be nonstop.  It was a little sad at times;it proving hard to say goodby to some old friends.  The story also took some twists and turns that I did not expect.  I had to space it out over several days to find the reading time, and it was all I could do to wait till after work.<br />  I re-read the two books leading up to this one just before the new book came out, and picked up some things that I had missed the first time.  Matt's part added just the right touch of humor, preventing the plot from becoming too dark.  My only problem was with Matt; I wanted to know more about him than was given.  Perrin's story twisted at my heart but Iliked the resolution.  I enjoyed the time spend with all of the main characters.  Most of the minor players had their lives resolved as well.<br />  Jordan and Sanderson fit well together.  You will need some time for this work, so don't start reading Monday morning on the way to work.  This last story was as good or better than any Wheel of Time story.  It is well worth the money and time you will spend.

1609611543|4.0|I am grateful that a young family physician recommended this book to me. Readers would need to observe their own blood sugar level, and how they feel physically within the hour of eating toasts, oatmeal, brown/white rice and/or any other regularly consumed grains, to quickly verify whether what Dr. Davis asserted applied to them. The reason I did not give this book a five-star rating was because of the less well researched writing on other --less frequently consumed-- \\"grains.&#34 Dr. Davis stated that Quinoa is one of the nonwheat grains with possibly the same insulin-distorting effect as wheat to a lesser extent, and without the undesirable immune and brain effects of wheat (Chapter 13, pp. 205, 212). I can cite more than one authoritative sources that describe Quinoa as a Chenopodioideae, vegetable-like plant (Spinach is a Chenopodioideae). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenopodioideae. Also, note that not all rice are equal. Worldwide there are more than 40,000 different varieties of rice.

B000VAKNJW|5.0|If you never lived or were lucky enough to see the actual performance of this on PBS or whatever it was, you can still hear the beauty of these three tenors.  Caruso died not long after of throat cancer (what a horror of irony that is), and Pavarotti died a few years ago (that is cataclysmic and shouldn't have been allowed).  They talk about Disney having preserved himself cryogenically...no no this is the thing that should have been done with Pavarotti.  Like burning the finest Steinway or Strad.<br /><br />Anyway, there is a 2nd performance of Nessun Dorma, done as a trio, which is funny and beautiful.  Though Caruso didn't seem to blend as well as Pavarotti and Domingo, it's more of a taking turns bit.  Incredible strength, musicianship, grace, and camaraderie.<br /><br />Cherish cherish cherish this while it's still available...and cherish Domingo as well while he's still around.  It may be the end of a great age of opera....hope not.

As they travel the United States, Maddie the dog, has a unique sense of trust and ability to prop on various 'things' which makes for interesting and fun filled viewing.  Great photography as well by her master.
B003XF1OK4|2.0|Perhaps Cunnihgham is modelling his style a little on Virginia Woolf here: he has a particular way of describing minute-by-minute reality as perceived by his characters which is highly literary but also, I think, encourages, or stems from - I'm not sure which - a particular way of looking at life. Atheistic perhaps? Dated even? Reminding me a little of Joyce at his most self-conscious. Instead of the book telling a story, the story tells the book. I frequently had to reread sections to remind myself through which of the women's eyes he was narrating and more than once I picked the book up with a huge sigh wondering whether I really wanted to go on with it: it's a highly depressing novel. Noone is happy:all are living life as a monumental struggle against the odds and the way in which the book weaves in and out was just ultimately too confusing for me to properly enjoy it when it was all supposed to come together. Nevertheless, Cunningham is a hugely talented writer and there were many occasions when I found myself nodding or chuckling at momentary truths that he highlights so beautifully. I can understand why it won prizes. Perhaps I'm just not literary enough.

B006MPKE9O|3.0|He is a very good story teller and there are some great stories in this book.  However, I sometimes got lost in all the different characters' stories, and forgot whose story I was reading. For me, this made the book lose its narrative story line as there were so many detours along the way.

B006ZZANFG|5.0|I do not ordinarily like &#34;live&#34; concert recordings: too much background noise, interruptions from the audience, poor recording quality. &#34;Nights from the Alhabra,&#34; however, is the rare exception. These performances are so full of life and vibrancy that McKennitt's studio recordings seem flat by comparison. This is really just that good.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|tryin to be a copy of the frist, not nearly as good. they end it with a hook, but never made a third
193700788X|2.0|On its own, this was an entertaining enough book, but for those (like myself) who have read the entire series, it was a disappointment.  What most bothered me was the feeling that this ending was rushed -- the end choices seemed logical and appropriate for the characters, but realizations came too quickly and conveniently to be believable.  My overall impression was that the decision was made this would be the last book, then the story was made to fit that purpose, rather than a story arc being carefully plotted out to end with this book.  As many others have commented, it feels that characters have changed in ways that do not make sense with what we have known about them in the past, and I did not like the sudden and awkward introduction of the third person viewpoint in a series that had been first-person limited for years.  I still deeply love the first several books in this series, and I will buy the upcoming wrap-up book because I have been with this series for so long.  However, I definitely will not be starting any new series by this author.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I can see why Maggie Smith keeps winning awards.  She is the star of this series, even with a small<br />roll.  Good story lines of WWI and the effects on the people. Looking forward to seeing Season 3

B0082RHRHC|5.0|Carlotte Bronte wrote when nothing but thoughts penetrated the airwaves.

B0050XFY4O|4.0|The movie is pretty mellow for a gay-themed / brotherly 'love' film, which tempts one to believe it'll be very controversial. However, the directors and writers mostly steer clear of the &#34;what will others think&#34; and really even the &#34;gay&#34; tension, which gives the film lots of room for character development. Although the film is definitely about two men, and there eventually is a sexual relationship, I can say with certainty, this film's focus is not on being gay. It actually transcends sexual orientation very skillfully. The brothers are almost never apart (until they are about 22 and 28 respectively) until the younger gets an invitation to Russia for swim training. This sets the pendulum swinging: is this a phase for them, or are they determined to be together for 'life'?<br /><br />I gave it four stars instead of five because, after working up a real tension with one of the parents who was concerned about the relationship, instead of confronting it, the writers chose to make it disappear entirely by &#34;offing&#34; a character.

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I am a sucker for Dexter and I am impressed that not only did the show press forward with Deb being aware of the &#34;real&#34; Dexter, it also makes numerous attempts to portray the turmoil Deb thrashes around in due to her little world being upended by the the one constant in her life--her murderous unrepentant brother.<br /><br />I like Hannah as a romantic interest for Dexter (I don't say love).<br />I also felt uncomfortable as Dexer tries a hand at killing &#34;outside the code.&#34; Which means they're doing a good job.<br />Although as far as his killings went, this season was the least disturbing in that aspect.<br />So if that is the aspect you really enjoy (which I did), this season is going to seem kind of slow.<br />A lot more focus on Dexter's personal problems and relationships.<br />Part of me wishes the show would simply go on, year after year, with methodical Dexter simply killing the people he kills, with more focus being on his hunting procedures and why he's killing who he's killing. The inter-relational focus has left Dexter in a corner, trapped, and dealing with Deb, and not doing his 'other job.'<br /><br />I am a bit bummed that the next season is the last. I have no idea, but I'm guessing Dexter is going to off himself. I assume Deb survives the show, because there was spinoff talk about her.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Gets a 9.5 out of 10 for comedy.  Would be a perfect 10 if I could turn off the laughtrack.  Each episode reminds me of old friends, gives me a review of science, and engages the fan-girl/gamer/sci fi freak in me.

B0084B5TK8|4.0|I initially downloaded this because it was free and I wanted to test something on the Kindle Reader app. for Android.  As far the app goes, it's okay.  But that's a review for another time.<br /><br />What I liked about this is that it is the original Bram Stoker transcription.  I thought there was always a possibility it would be rewritten in a modern vocabulary using current terms and phrases (in this age of current vampire movies).  Instead, I was pleased to find it in its original state, no modernizing of the language or terminology.  Amazing how Hollywood doesn't understand that if something (this book, as written) has survived and is still read by many people, maybe keeping it as is might work.  Although they seem to be busy these days living off sequels.  That's not to say that all the sequels are bad (I've enjoyed many of them myself).  But sometimes things just don't need to be changed and this story, in its original form is one of them.  But at least we have Amazon to keep the original stories alive in their pure form.  Okay, done rambling....
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Being a fan of TesseracT, I will admit I had HUGE expectations with this second LP.  I consider the suite \\" Concealing Fate\\" as one of the most inspiring piece of progressive rock music since \\"A change of season\\".<br />  Well, in a nutschell, ALTERED STATE is a mind blowing MASTERPIECE.<br />To sum up, I would go like this :<br />- Music : flawless tunes , very well balanced  and on top ADDICTING<br />- Ashe O' Hara 's voice  : wonderfull, powerfull and beautifull<br />- Progressive Density : this LP could be labelled as Top Notch  Progressive music , ie : the songs don't go towards 10 musical directions at the same time<br />- Production : simply astonishing.  Ackle and Amos accomplished a great work here.  It's spacial, dense, tight and refreshing.  In my opinion, the mixing treatment on Drums is fantastic.<br /><br />The album is a MUST buy. I woud add also that LIVE, TesseracT is a terrific experience. The overall sound of the Band is unique.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|The interface looks nice and the sound samples for each key are very realistic. Don't expect to compose a symphony...well, maybe a one note at a time symphony. :)

B008BU75IQ|5.0|This is Jeffrey Archer at his best. Being number 3 of 3 in the Clifton Chronicles sereies, I suggest you read numbers 1 and 2 first.This book tied everything together very well . It is a wonderful series with great characters, good story line, and it's hard to put down. And guess what....There is another one coming. Read them all. Then, wait for the next one. Amazon will not let you down !
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I loved this game! It is funny, challenging, and a good time filler.  Unfortunately,  I come from a time when if you bought a game you got the whole game. I already paid for the game why should I shell out more money for the rest of it.  Shouldn't that be called,  &#34; Angry Birds Star Wars 2?&#34;  The way I am made to feel that I am missing something if I don't buy the end is wrong.  It is a bait and switch that just ticks me off.  I loved this game but could not give it 5 stars because some scammer wants to make a buck.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|Love it!  An exciting and moving version of life-ending and doomsday.  I can't wait to see it in blu-ray on my hdtv..
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put my kindle down! Awesome read! I love the characters  and the story just gets better the further you read! It has wonderful details and makes you feel as though you're witnessing every moment and emotion in the book.

B00A7W29BE|4.0|I don't usually rate anything,  especially apps, but I had to do so to combat the negative reviews of those who don't read or use common sense before downloading an app.<br />First, for those claiming that this is nothing but a camera app- I'm not certain what camera they have but mine does not allow me to group photos into in document and automatically save them as a PDF for easy sharing. Second, for those complaining that this app does not work on their Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD - 1) this is the Amazon store not the Kindle store. Anyone owning an Android device is able to use the Amazon store. Therefore,  not all apps here are going to be appropriate for the Kindle. 2) it is clear that this app would require a camera. It is also only logical that, unless you are prepared to do some pretty awkward maneuvering, the camera has to be rear-facing. Lastly, please base your reviews on what the app description says it can do, not on what you wish or randomly expected it to be able to do. If you have suggestions on improvements contact the developers to make them in future upgrades or figure out how to make an app and go for it. All that being said this app functions as described. You scan pictures,  magazine/newspaper articles or whatever else the genius scanner saves it as a PDF that you can then share or take several and combine into one document and then send. I like it because rather then having to attach things one at a time into an email which the recipient then has to open one at a time,  I can compile a single document and send it all at once. Great for applying for jobs via email or sending professiinal emails. Much easier than the scanner on my four-in-one at home.

0812993845|3.0|I must confess that I have a love/hate relationship with Sophie Kinsella's books.  I loved Remember Me? A Novel and Can You Keep a Secret?  The characters in those books were so endearing that I could not put the book down and recommended them to all my friends.<br /><br />However, I read but didn't particularly enjoy The Undomestic Goddess and Twenties Girl.  I felt the characters in those books were meant to be lovable losers but, to me, came off as grating characters that just annoyed me with their unbelievable actions.<br /><br />The Wedding Night falls squarely in the middle of these two extremes.  I found Lottie to be emotionally stunted for a woman in her thirties.  Her actions were meant to be sweet and romantic but really just came off as juvenile to me.  Her older sister, Fliss, is more believable as the bitter divorcee.  I've known several women like that.  Of course, I'm not friends with any of them anymore because a girl can only take so many months of the bitter rants before they have break free to save themselves.  Also as the older sister I can relate to wanting to protect your flighty younger sister from themselves.  Fliss's actions were completely over-the-top though; don't get me wrong on that front.  Fliss's son, Noah, is drawn as one of those cute-as-a-button-isn't-he-just-too-precious kids that drive me nuts in real life.  Ben is your typical man-child who has the body of a 35 year old but acts like a horny teenage boy and has the maturity of a 12 year old.  Sadly, I have dated a few of those knuckleheads and tragically they do exist.  And on, and on.<br /><br />So in my final analysis this would be a good beach or airplane read but expect to do more eye rolling then laughing out loud.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|How do you even begin to put yourself in that position? The story was so well written. Nothing flowery and fluffy. Just telling a story and keeping it real. I have children and have also been put in the unenviable position of having to trust blindly. Of course my trust never had the kind of ramifications that this story does. It is still a tough position to be in. The characters of the story were very believable and my heart was wrapped up in all of them. That is not an easy task, so kudos to the writer. I could not put the book down, the subject matter was great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Where was this book when I was in my late teens/early twenties?!<br /><br />Besides being beautifully written, Hopeless is not just a read for entertainment. This is an important book. It belongs in the hands of any teen who has had to go through any kind of major, or even minor, family crap at home. I'm sure there are plenty, unfortunately.<br /><br />The romance rocks. Really the best example of what a loving, REAL relationship looks like. I capitalized real because it gets off to a rocky start with misunderstandings and secrets. Such is life. I love the way Sky and Holder turned it around.<br /><br />Lots of surprises, but it's the emotional depth that is the most incredible.
B0071AKB38|4.0|great sound ... total freedom with bluetooth. A little weak in the decibels ... could be a little bigger and louder but great if you just want to rock out in a quiet area with not to much background noise. i would but again.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This CD does not only exceed my expectations, it set a new level of how I judge music.  From start to finish, this CD is pleasure.  I knew I liked Fun, and knew 2 songs from my radio listening, but now I am debating getting the first CD also.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Do you see me? Over there, pimping Tangled? There I am, on Facebook stalking Emma Chase. That's me too, the co-worker leaning over your cube asking if you've read it yet.<br /><br />Five big stars. I'm a picky picky beeyotch people. I have a goodreads shelf of books I refused to even finish. Tangled most certainly was not one of them. I can't believe this is a debut novel. I was only halfway through before I was clicking on Amazon to see if Emma Chase had additional titles available. Sadly she does not. Let's hope she's one of those that can churn out a book in a few months. Or has a flash drive full of books already completed. Please.<br /><br />Alright, why did I love Tangled? Loved the male perspective. I loved Drew. When I really love or hate a book I love to look at the reviews on Amazon to see if I was alone in my feelings. Tangled has a few 1 & 2 star reviews. Which of course I had to read because I wondered what book these reviews could possibly be referring to. One woman gave it a low rating & was appalled that he referred to his sister as The Bitch. Beeyotch, it was funny! Just stay in your own lane if you have no sense of humor. Another reviewer was appalled at what a player Drew is. Maybe I'm a jerk, but I loved it. He made no apologies for his behavior and he misleads NO ONE. The guy was more than honest with his conquests. Listen to Drew ladies, he tells you himself if a guy you JUST MET in a club calls you baby while you're giving him a BJ, it's because he doesn't know or care what your name is.<br /><br />I couldn't stop highlighting this book. Normally I just highlight spelling errors (because I'm a bit of a beeyotch as we've already established). This time I used the highlight feature to mark all my favorite parts.<br /><br />The niece! Mackenzie. Loved how the kid was written. Loved Drew's interactions with her.<br />  \\"I wanna be a princess. And I wanna marry a prince and live in a castle.\\"<br />  \\"Or, you could go into real estate. Then you could buy the castle yourself and you won't need the prince.\\"<br />This entire scene is hilarious. \\"Momma sold herself short sweetie.\\" Highlight, highlight, highlight.<br /><br />If you're looking for me, I'll be over there appointing myself president of the Emma Chase fan club. See me there? With my poster board and my glitter markers? Tapping my toes impatiently waiting for a new book?d buy the castle yourself and you won't need the prince.\\"<br />This entire scene is hilarious. \\"Momma sold herself short sweetie.\\" Highlight, highlight, highlight.<br /><br />If you're looking for me, I'll be over there appointing myself president of the Emma Chase fan club.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As with many sequels, the first book in the Hunger Games series is definitely the best. The second and third give closure to sub-stories, but do not have the same level of surprises and adventure of the first.

0143115014|5.0|I initially bought this as a gift for a friend who loves perfume but I have now bought it for myself as well. The perfume reviews are great, entertaining when Luca and Tania like a perfume and hysterical when they don't. I especially loved the Q&A section when the most commonly asked question by women; What fragrance do men most like? Bacon!

B00CW665VI|1.0|Never do reviews but someone needs to warn you. This is written from the man's perspective by a woman author. Starts out with him moping eating ice cream and pizza, not answering the phone or the door over a woman. Never met a man like this. Then he quotes Pretty Woman. Really? Men quote Dumb and Dumber not chic flics. Then they try to convince you he is a player when you are already convinced he is a pansy. This is your warning. I want my money back.

B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great story told with suspense and intrigue.  Baldacci is an amazing storyteller with each book of his that I pick up.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am a big fan of the books, but I must say this one (and a bit the previous one) really dissappointed me. I waited for each of them with a lot of anticipation, and though there were some better than others, I enjoyed all of  them since they provide a thrilling story with really good characters. I feel like the story and the characters lost themselves, like they were not what they used to be. It felt more like a bad fan fiction than an actual book. I had to struggle through the pages, there were very little supernatural things, and it was focused on the &#34;normal&#34; part of her life, but to be honest, it is not what I read the books for, I really don't care for reading about her tomatoes, or her cooking abilities. I am not trying to offend anyone who might like it, but it is just not my thing when it's all the book talks about. I used to admire Sookie, as she was a badass, but in this book the message I got from her was that we should all be normal and avoid the different things, that no matter how much your neighbours judged you, in the end it's better to stay with them and be part of the community than to be around other 'strange people' (in this case all the supernatural beings). She regreted all she had done so far, things that we, her fans were proud of, of her standing up and defending herself. I think they changed her whole character, not to mention others, like Eric. It's not just that I wanted them to be together, but that his character was very ruined. We were shown that there was goodness in him, and that he loved Sookie more than anything, and suddenly he sells himself in the blink of an eye, without even trying to fight it (and we've seen them fight much worse things previously). The worst part is Sookie not really feeling bad about it; at least if you are going to break them up, give them a proper break up, with proper feelings and goodbyes. I wish this wouldn't have been the end of the story, as it left me feeling sad and empty. I liked Sam, but there was never really any development of the relationship between them, and to choose him as her happy ending seems like a very big random act. Oh, and last but not least, using a wish (granted by the devil) to get an object to grant you another wish (cluviel dor), seriously?
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is my all time favorite Christmas story, and I think that I have seen all of the film versions as well.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This tiny little product does an excellent job!!! It has professional quality at an affordable price and works great with my Nikon d5100
0061373877|5.0|This is a great story, set in modern times, with a likable hero who journeys on a quest through an amazing underworld of London. The writing is atmospheric and, being narrated by the author, evocative. I have had the discs for many years and have listened to them several times.<br />I'd recommend for anyone who likes Neil Gaiman, and anyone who perks up with a mention of alternative myth, magic and atmosphere.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|Coming from the guy who did Pan's Labyrinth I thought I was going to have a great experience, but this was totally NOT worth my time or money. Thank God I didn't pay to see it in the theater.

0743454537|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter.  She loves to read.  She finishes them so fast, it seems like I am buying them every other day.  I would recommend this book.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I buy these Bones tapes after every season for my wife who is a big fan of several sitcoms. Perfect for the guy who loves his<br />sports and is looking for something that the wife can enjoy.

B00BW5K5DO|5.0|My wife introduced me to this game about two years ago. It was (is) fun on the PC. so finding it for the Kindle Fire was a bonus. The controls (obviously) are different, but the game still is fun. Its fun for the whole gaming family.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is not the type of book that I normally read but I really enjoyed this!! I read about it on a social network and wanted to try it as I'd already read the Ian Fleming books and what a lovely surprise!!<br /><br />It was very well written and very entertaining - must admit I read mostly on the train and I was actually hoping it would be delayed so I could squeeze just a couple more pages in each day....<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, I have already!!<br /><br />Great author and great style
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game the family can play.  We have family contest.  Wish we could play against each other.  We all recommend d it.

B005MLOKXA|5.0|Never watched when it was on TV...should have.  It is a great show! Glad I can get it through Amazon.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game ! Very fun and addicting. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes<br /><br /> mahjong. Really great puzzle designs.
B001O9BB3G|5.0|I've read it several times. Where all lesbian fiction authors seem to fall short, this author excels. Truly, one of the best books I've read. She captures reality in such a painful, poignant and relatable way. Even though I literally have no similarities between my life and the lives of the characters, I found myself relating to them. I could feel what they felt, cared for what they cared for and wanted what they wanted.<br /><br />My absolute favorite thing about the way she writes is that she jumps from the perspective of the main characters and often shares the perspectives of secondary characters. This does so much for expanding the story without too much narrative. I LOVE this work and I love her other book, &#34;I can't think straight&#34;.<br /><br />Beautiful.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|As one would expect, this book is not light reading. It is very heavy. Still it's worth reading. Specially if you know anyone who has been raped or suffered abuse. It drove home to me how rape (and sex for that matter) are so much more than a physical act. It has deep emotional consequences.<br /><br />Definitely not for the faint of heart.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game in my opinion.  I like be able to play with bingo buddies. The only thing i have found wrong with this game is that you do not always get free stuff for liking and sharing their advertisements without having to fill out surveys and give credit card number. I think if it is supposed to be free it should be.

B00C7DGRL4|5.0|The music soundtrack is perfect for this movie, though a bit &#34;too rock&#34; for me personally. It is a really cool, gothic twist to the old fairy tale. However, they could have avoided using the &#34;F&#34; word so many times. And as always, Jeremy Renner is HOT, HOT, HOT.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|and I gotta tell ya it's one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the cars, the story line, the acting, and the violence it reminded me of Mafia 2 the video game, the movie was awesome I loved it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game. I love the colors and sounds of all the dragons. In the game you have to build habitats for your dragons and then breed them.The exciting part is you can make rare dragons without having to buy them. Collecting coins couldn't be easier . I am 42 years old and love this game, my 10 and 6 year olds love playing as well. I would definitely recommend this game.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I was informed it's for PCs and other devices such as phones, and I didn't need this option. So this review is neutral, and maybe useful with those uses in the future, if I ever need it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story is still about Afghanistan and yet it never failed to amaze me, Khaled Hosseini has a way of describing something so detail yet not boring as if I was experiencing the story myself. Some characters were described very brief and with no continuation but overall I am still looking forward to his next book!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Not enough of us take the time realize how much Steve Jobs' accomplishments have changed our lives and the lives of our children.  From his influence on the computer and music industries, to the compelling of character of Woody in Toy Story, Mr. Jobs has touched us all.  My hat is off to Walter Isaacson for keeping this biography so balanced between Steve's life and his works.  Every page worth turning!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I read the book and thought it was okay.  The movie I thought was a better presentation of the ideas in the book and tied the themes together better.  Really loved the visuals and the music.  Excellent choice for sci-fi fans!
B005R32L66|4.0|I have been a big fan of Skype for a long time.  It is great to have this app on my tablet.  Now I can Skype from my favorite sandwich show without my laptop.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I downloaded the book primarily for the recipes - the reviews had all commented on the great vegan recipes.  Once I started reading the story, I couldn't put it down.  Much of Scott's story is not anything I can relate to in terms of the specific activities, but about halfway in I realized that his points about life and finding meaning were bigger than the specifics of his own personal story.  Unexpectedly very inspiring!  Scott Jurek is an impressive person with a remarkable story.  And, the recipes throughout the book DO look really good.  Can't wait to try!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I have not had a chance to do much with this app, because I am taking a break from Facebook until Sept.  I need to back off some from the computer and  enjoy some outdoor activities.  And that does mean setting a coffee shop with my tablet.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|What an easy app to use and such a fun way to send greetings to family and friends. Not only Tom will sing what you'd like him to sing, you can also touch his face and belly and funny things happen. Make sure to record it all.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|A nice app for young and old.  I am enjoying it, as well as my grandson.  might even learn a thing or two.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an addictive game. Easy to get coins and stuff. FUN and oh yeah I forgot to mention FUN
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was really great! Stephen Chbosky really characterizes Charlie in a relatable way! It was an interesting, fast read. :)
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|This game is pretty okay. No amazingly awesome graphics or anything, but passable. Controls aren't easy at first but you can get used to them. It's hard to lock your aim on the enemy plane but I guess that's the point. I don't know if I will keep this game as it was pretty amusing at first but now it's just boring and frustrating because I cannot get the hang of it. It's worth downloading free today but I don't know about any day else.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One of David Baldacci`s best. A great read. I give it 5 stars.<br />I look forward to reading more stories about Robie.

0765367351|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. The author really knows how to capture your attention. It's extremely interesting to see how it all began. You must pick up this book!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a story of solitary and troubled characters bound together and salvaged by an unusual common denominator--flowers.  The way they bind to eventually form a family is spellbinding.  Their emotions are much more complex and tangled than are sometimes understandable but readers can't help but be drawn in to their lives.  The beauty of nature soothes their souls.
0316187216|4.0|I have to say, \\"Yes to all that\\" contained in the many reader reviews.  Red Country has a distinctly Western epic flavor, part The Searchers, The Way West, etc. placed in a Far Country of another time perhaps.<br />The other reviews tell of the plot lines, so all I will say it that at the end of the book, I knew I had read a good story, beautifully told. Like one of the classic Westerns, The Searchers, the hero here, Lamb reminded me of Ethan a man with a past, searching for lost family. Like Ethan, at the end, Lamb is alone in the sunset of his success, his past and his love. Perhaps a bit slow at times, but when violence comes, it comes howling with bloodlust.<br />Well written characters  are the mercenary chief, Cosca, a dangerous buffoon, Temple, a cowardly lion who finds his heart and Shy, who loses, gains and regains.<br />I closed the book and said, \\"Wow, that was good.\\"
0131103628|5.0|I love it and very good looks like new one. I love it, love it, love it so much, thank you!
B000SW16M6|3.0|the sophisticated genius responsible for this memorable affectation was lost on me b/c he was the biggest wimp of all.... too afraid to skip studying for his trig final, too scared driving over the speed limit in a porsche, too nervous being with a professional woman, overall mega scardy cat! hence, advice taken by Joel is the only impressive follow-thru in film as he shows initiative by listening to a real professional, Lana! I expected no moral ground achievements in this film, just wanted to see the 'dance' and the scintilating choo-choo scenes which were the highlight of most 80's films of that genre.... very well directed and high recommend for TC fans and seXy scenes w/RDM....  and wow, what a mom that trusts her kid implicitly throughout entire film but as soon as she sees a hairline crack in some dumb glass piece she adamantly accuses her precious perfection of intentional irresponsible destruction, no questions asked...duh!  Great MUSIC SCORE by Tangerine Dream, etc.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I could play this game ALL DAY long!!!!  Buying this game was the best 99 cents I have ever spent.
0007477155|3.0|Paper version = 5 stars. I recommend.<br />Kindle version = 0 stars. I do *NOT* recommend.<br />Overall experience: 2.5 stars.<br /><br />(1) I bought this new UK paperback 7-book set from Amazon Seller ---SuperBookDeals, under heading \\"Paperback, May 1, 2012\\" even though the book was actually published HarperVoyager in 2011 (9780007448036). The box-set took three weeks to arrive. Waiting that long a time was hard. They had to ship the box Library Rate ($4)?<br /><br />This has nothing to do with Amazon or the books per se, just the way the author chose to organize the table of contents and chapters. The way the author named the chapters is annoying: the chapters themselves list only the point-of-view person -- no chapter number -- which means, for example, there are eleven chapters entitled \\"Catelyn,\\" and 72 chapters in all. The table of contents, such as it is, is no help, other than \\"Chapter 24\\"; there is no chapter name to give any idea of what the chapter contains. I went on Wiki to get the table of contents. I'm so glad that I follow in others' footsteps! This is a sucky way to treat readers. The author is remiss -- he must have had a reason, but it adds nothing to the readability of the book series -- rather, it detracts.<br /><br />(2) I also purchased the Kindle version of this book-volume- set. It was an awful experience. After months of crashing/hanging, I realized the crashes were not going to stop, and in November 2013 asked Amazon for a refund, which they did. So what's wrong with this Kindle bundle? It's gotta be one of Amazon's dumbest moves to cancatenate these books, making it one humongous book. They got rid of individual books' location-numbering. They re-numbered the locations to be all one book. Not a smart move. Bigger is *NOT* better. The sheer size of this volume-set is likely what caused the Kindle to crash 1-20 times per day. I don't recommend this Kindle bundle -- in any way, shape, or form. For Kindle format, buy the five volumes separately.<br /><br />Since I bought the individual Kindle books, I am now reading aggravation-free, at long last.ely.<br /><br />Since I bought the individual Kindle books, I am now reading aggravation-free, at long last.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|This album is just beautiful. That's the best way to describe this album. I was looking forward to this album since it was announced and boy does it deliver. The National are really relentless when it comes to producing good music. I'm 22, and ill admit, I've never heard a band from this currant generation that keeps coming up with great hits on multiple albums. Put in Alligator, Boxer, High Violet, Trouble Will Find Me, I could listen to them all day. I think everyone's covered the album in good detail so I wont get into to much. Now I don't want to say this is best album so far, but it is by far still an excellent album. Took my 2-3rd listen to fully grasp the whole range of the album. Gotta give it to Matt Berninger, the guy was born to write and sing songs. His lyrics just take you to that place and situation he's singing about. As sad as some of their songs are, they have this quality that relaxes me, and keeps me optimistic. The only ONE complaint I have is they could have arranged the songs better. The songs are up and down in terms of beat. I really hope this isn't their last album, but if it is, it surely didn't disappoint. When people ask what my favorite band is, first answer The National. Keep the great music coming!
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|Yes, it would have been so great if Neil Young just made \\"Harvest\\" over and over. And all of Pink Floyd albums sounded like Dark Side of the Moon, and when the Beatles broke up, I didn't want to hear Imagine or Uncle Albert. I just wanted to listen \\"Paperback Writer\\" for the rest of my life. I've left bands because playing the same songs the same way is worse than working at McDonalds. The most common reason bands break up is because they are sick to death of being pidgeon-holed into playing the same crap over and over. How many times can you honestly listen to \\"Naked as we came\\" ?<br />Great song but move on people
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|to artsy and hard to keep up for me to be able to enjoy this movie.  so to each his own
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first Hunger Games book and watching the movie I took a long break before starting the next book in the series.  I needed a little space from the idea of children being systematically murdered in a cruel and senseless combination of entertainment and punishment.  The second book delivered and I started the final book right away only to feel really let down by it's conclusion.  The bloodshed of innocents was resumed with a painful vengeance but the worst was the feeling of betrayal I felt by Katness's decision at the end of the book.  The strength and moral conviction that made her so likeable before felt completely shredded by the end of the novel and for what purpose?  The book is a captivating read but not a happy one
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another great season of walking dead. I liked this season better than season 2, but they were all awesome!  A+
B00821PCJS|2.0|Poor screenplay, marginal acting, little thought into creating a plot that is something more or different that what you've seen over and over again.  They keep trying to tie it into the American revolution, but it was done in such an obvious and poor manner.  How did this series get so many stars?
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I liked the first book so I was excited to read this one. It was an easy read and I liked that so much took place in the Outer Provinces, but I expected more to happen. This was definitely a transition book, because the characters developed and we learned more about the society but not a lot of action happened.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|This movie had spme good action scenes and the actors were very good. The plot was plausible  and was fun to watch.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's pretty awesome but make sure it's on the right tablet or console. Also when you are playing it is going to be really easy.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Monster is very cute. Some of the levels get quite challenging.  Kids (9 and 11) have fun with it. Really
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I love movies that make you pay attention.  I could watch that one again, and again... Excellent casting, fun deciding who the actors were playing in each scene.
0670026603|4.0|This was a dynamic story. The friendship and love that grows between Louisa Clark and Will Traynor was achingly beautiful. They were able to pull things from each other to map out a path that was beneficial to living life as loud as possible (each of them in different ways). The story so clearly demonstrates what the power of love can do.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Once again, Dexter keeps you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward to viewing Seasons 7 and 8!  Enjoy!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Lee Child pays exquisite attention to the details of high calibre marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat and romance amid obstacles that would thwart any other hero in print today. The plot is straightforward, with the perfect number of twists and turns to keep the most seasoned adventure fan guessing.  The heroine, FBI Special Agent Holly Johnson,  is an outstanding foil for  Reacher, handling  herself in some of the tightest spots ever,  She could easily carry her OWN series of novels.  Jack Reacher in his usual unstoppable form;  one can understand how readers can easily become addicted to Lee Child's &#34;take no prisoners&#34; narrative style. This book will be an excellent Father's Day gift for every Dad (or Mom) who enjoys the genre. Great dialogue, believable situations and dastardly villains enrich the pages and leave you wishing for more as you turn the final page.
0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug takes a minimalist approach to usability testing, a common sense approach to web design, and a user's eye view approach to web site usability.  Having read most of this book, and already started to apply what I have learned, I highly recommend this book to other designers and testers for its simple explanations of what could be a very complex topic.<br /><br />I love the book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Need to relax and expand your mind at the same time?  This is an amazingly excellent way to do it!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I just love this leather cover.  It protects my kindle fire and is very sturdy.  It has a pocket on the inside where you can hold some important notes or papers.  Worth the money!
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|For anyone who has resisted watching this series, or just keeps missing it, or finds the plot too confusing to pick up in the middle, by all means buy this set. This show is a marvel: well written, original, funny, and full of great suspense. (To say nothing of the right on target fun it makes of various characters' vanities.) Tatiana Maslany is like an actress sent here from heaven: not just pulling off the trick of playing several different versions of one clone, but filling them with nuance -- sensitivities, neuroses, sexiness, creepiness; whatever the character requires. She is someone to keep on eye on -- a great career is in the offing. And the rest of the cast is also first rate. This series has a quality of adult intelligence that has almost vanished from television. Don't miss it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was engaging and hard to put down.  i would recommend it to anyone that likes exciting plots between couples.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is a masterpiece and VERY well written. Just wonderful. The whole trilogy was great to read and delve into. Cannot wait for another book of hers to come out
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Best show in years if this show gets cancelled it's because people are idiots. Even though it is a theme/characters I know well, it's unique & beautifully executed. I never thought Hannibal could be more enjoyable than A. Hopkins but Mads Mikelsen is killing it!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|I would of loved to have kept this one but it dint work with my Kindle Fire HD.  Get an error message saying 'there's been an internal error' and then just exits. A bit disappointed.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Perhaps I am a bit naive, but I did not see most of the plot twists in the last 300 pages coming. Will start book four tomorrow.
B009AMANBA|1.0|The movie was so complicated it was lost to reality.  Too many characters and an assumption that the viewers knew the process of enacting a bill in Congress
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good in that feel good cutesy kind of way. They actually managed to make what seemed to be a boring plot line fun and entertaining. The acting was great too.
0374533555|5.0|I've been somewhat familiar with the work of Kahneman and his now-deceased longtime colleagues, Tversky, for about six years. I wish I had come across it earlier. This book summarizes some 50 years of research and is a truly fascinating read. I am dog-earing pages all the time. I consider it a must-read for anyone who considers him or herself a social science researcher.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|First of all, I couldn't wait to write this review. This game has amazing 3D graphics that blew me away on my galaxy note 2. The graphics are so clear and precise that i feel like I'm inside the game first hand. The controls are simple to use but definitely require practice. The game is addicting and simply amazing. This is one of the<br />best games ive ever downloaded.<br /><br />If you're getting it on the day that Amazon is giving it away for free GET IT.<br /><br />If you happen to miss the all day sale, buy it. The game is definitely worth the price!!!!!!<br /><br />If I could rate this game 10 stars I definitely would.
B005G26NJE|4.0|I like it, unique and original blues!<br />What more can I say but you can't beat the price and convenience.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie. The movie kept my attention and the ending kept me thinking for some time to come.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The cord is too short.  With the base in your pocket at waist level, the headphones tend to tug from your ears.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books in the Clifton series and wonder how many more books are to come.  I hope we don't have to wait a whole year between books in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great great great! LOVE this series! I couldn't put it down. I read the whole series. Was sad when I read the last. Def a must have!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|smart, entertaining and possible in real life. A must read to get a smile on your dial. A book you read and tell your friends about.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|One of the best David Fincher movies and a great screening on the existential theme of &#34;The Fall&#34;. And the build up to the final moments make it a masterful film
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album is awesome. It is one of new favorites. Have not been really impressed with a lot of the new bands, This is the exception. Great album for anyone.
B000001DZM|5.0|This was a pretty fantastic film when it first came out (no pun intended) and even today in 2013 it is fantastic. Now I can just play it over and over again.<br /><br />The question remains as to why Rupauls drag superstar wannabees don't use the film for ideas?  Just asking?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I fell in love with so many of the. characters!  By the end I cried for Abdullah, and each Pari.  The story is an epic that I wish didn't have to end.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|If you've seen any other of the Transformers movies, this is really no different. Lots of action, explosions, and tumbling, twirling, screeching metal robots. Optimus Prime finally has his trailer, even though he is still the wrong kind of tractor. There are NASCAR robots with Scottish(?) accents. Leonard Nimoy is a robot. Story is kind of lame, and most of the acting seems lackluster. Maybe the actors are just tired of these movies but need to draw a paycheck.  My friends said this is the best movie of the franchise...maybe I should get new friends.
159463176X|4.0|Honestly, it was off to a slow start for me because I was a bit confused. I had to check the cover a couple of times to check what I was reading.<br /><br />About the style (story perspectives changing); the perspective changed as soon as I got really interested in what would happen next, and then i would get confused and have to search the context to see who was talking next. I would get it eventually (sometimes right away, sometimes not until three people had told their stories), but I didn't mind this so much. In the beginning I was upset because I felt so lost, but after the story got to Abdullah and Pari (maybe 10 min in) it got interesting really fast. After I finished the book, I can definitely appreciate the craft of writing a novel this way, and I think it was well done. It all made sense and there was a big OHHH at the end that made it worth while.<br /><br />I could definitely recognize Khaled Hosseini's way of character painting. He gets to the core flaws of human character so truthfully, and you can easily recognize some of the feelings; the characters were very personal and relatable. I really love the way he writes his characters. But let me tell you, my dear goodness. The ending! :O Beautiful, really. It had the same Hosseini touch that makes you just fall apart/try to swallow the orange-sized lump in your throat. I am so grateful to him for writing this third book! My time was well spent.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Its a fun game but takes awhile to play. I think it should be good. I will leave an update soon.
B0072VMWP6|5.0|I've been waiting for a compilation of all Austen's novels into one, and this one was inexpensive (7 for ~$10), had my favorites, and I loved the cover! So happy ^^
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I have tried all suggestions so far to find a way to add Adobe Flash Player 11.1 to my Kindle 5.1, not HD. One suggestion was to download ES File Explorer as a first step.  After downloading ES successfully, however, I am still stopped in my tracks when it comes to downloading the Adobe.  The reason I need the Flash Player is so that I can read online magazines through Zinio.  If you have a good suggestion please email to me.  Thanks.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A must have.  Love it, love it!  Light! Easy to manage and great adjustable font that allows you to size up the words, and allowing you to put your eye glasses away.
B008CIUS72|1.0|After installing ES Explorer, I installed SWF, but it does not permit me to read online magazines through Zinio.  If you have any ideas, I would like to hear them. thanks
B009MYARIK|1.0|I love so many of Sohia Kinsella's books. I fell in love with Confession of a Shopaholic ten years ago and have consumed each effort after. She makes me laugh out loud and worry for these girls and their crazy plans so I was excited for this book. But this book was bad. I know it's a beach read. I know it's going to be an impossibly cheesy love story but did it have to be so bad. I didn't once laugh. I predicted the ending from 50 pages in. I really tried to like it, I kept thinking it will get better but it didn't and I feel I wasted my time. It just felt like the same story but adding a sister with her own messy life. Maybe that was it. Having two main characters seemed to take away from the story. It seems that since the Shopaholic series I like every other Sophia Kinsella book. I'd recommend Can You Keep A Secret?, Undomestic Goddess and I've Got Your Number. Hopefully the next book will be better.
B001UTW7QU|2.0|I did not find it engaging at all, and some times even laughed at how lame the lines were. &#34;The phone is my pocket!! The phone is out of my pocket!!&#34; haha, that was funny ...but it was not supposed to be
1451695195|5.0|This book confirms my believe in the afterlife after death of the body. I have experienced personal tragedy with the death of my loving partner in February of 2011. The soul of my loved one continues to communicate with me in the apartment we shared together. I know are souls are destined for eternal life and go to a place filled with love and joy. Are souls continue to live.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I think its awesome because its almost like being a real king or queen . you could also chat with others around the nations
9626343230|3.0|It had several spots that wouldn't play however they didn't seem to be in significant parts of the book.  I thought it was expensive for such an old book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Anker really surprised me with this one. The fluid control and style is what I needed. Love the design and the dpi is superb. For the price it really don't get better then this. A very well made mouse. I would recommend to anyone need of a gaming mouse. Thank you very much Anker.
B003O86FMW|2.0|This book seems to really drag for me.  I will not be purchasing the third volume.  Perhaps it needs the visuals of the movie.
B005CRQ2IU|1.0|Just as my title states, Amazon was selling the Kindle version for $3.99 but the site never allowed me to purchase it. I tried on my desktop and tablet, neither allowed downloading. Fortunately, I never paid for it otherwise I would have been angry. Now, Amazon is selling the Kindle version for $10.99 I refuse to purchase it now. I already have the trade paperback, but for $3.99 that was a steal for the Kindle version. Sorry, Amazon you just lost a sale because your site was not being user friendly.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This book is the third in the Harry Clifton series and is a fast reading, interesting book.  I am three quarters the way through and I am thoroughly enjoying Archer's pace and plot.  His writing is uncomplicated, his plot easy to follow yet has its twists and turns.  There is no violence or overt sexual content and this series can be enjoyed by everyone.  I suggest the trilogy should be read in order for a better  understanding of the characters and the storyline.<br /><br />Good reads and highly recommended
1609611543|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. Since I have had symptoms that he references in this book, I decided to dump all the wheat and anything with wheat or whatever he said to stay away from. I dumped a lot from my kitchen pantry. After a week of no wheat, my brain fog has cleared up, I don't hurt as much (fibromyalgia), and I don't have the appetite I had 8 days ago. I have also lost 4 lbs. I'm not doing this for the weight loss but my health.  My husband's appetite has also decreased.  I went thru withdrawal but I started coming out if it at 5 days.  My husband didn't have withdrawal but he ate a wheat product. He had a headache within 24 hours.<br /><br />I have a science and medical background and this all makes sense to me. Consider wheat a toxin.<br /><br />Added Note: In 3 months I lost 25 lbs. My weight has been stable for the last 8 months. I still don't eat wheat. If I get any at all, I get a reaction that isn't pleasant.

B00BQHA06A|5.0|As you hear a tape placed in a deck, Instrumental track Unleash the red sets the mood for the Epic mystical journey that is Tears on Tape .As Unleash the red fades into the wonderfully rocking but still melodic sentimental All lips go blue the journey has begun with chiming bell like synths ,deep emotional guitar riffs and Valo with his unique but beautiful vocals crooning morose yet uplifting lyrics that only he could write All lips go blue ends on a soft sullen tone as it leads into a  marvellous ode to love's darker side Love without tears begins with  a soft  melodie , linde's brilliant guitars and Valo bleeding his heart out in this spine chilling ballad , leaving you craving more as they give you just that in ,I will be the end of you  , Gas's  drums beating for a broken heart and Valo challenging love itself and standing his ground with airy other worldly vocals and poetic lyrics it complements the entitled fifth track ,Tears on Tape pulls you in further with simple yet stunning keyboards,guitar riffs and vocals to shed a tear to, this is simply a beautiful mournful ode to the artist's craft and a salute to those who came before , with thunderous guitar riffs  we are lead ,Into to the Night the wonderful Sixth track ,Valo showing his astounding vocal range and poetic heart by the end of the track you are ready to meet HIM there, masculinely seductive  Hearts at War with its deep guitars riffs , sensual vocals and poetically male lyrics it is the alpha of love songs as it drafts off into the eerie instrumental track Trapped in autumn which you cannot help but get lost in, but not for long as No love opens with Valo's foot steps and him screaming in agony \\"forever and ever\\", this is one of my  favorite tracks off the album with monstrous guitar riffs , and Ville moaning beautifully of how Love can for some not be enough to heal past wounds simply perfection ,as No love comes to a close , hope begins with Drawn &Quartered  beautiful acoustic guitar flowing in like rain then a lighting strike guitar riff ,as Valo sings of hope and pain as  one in the same and how in the end pain and waiting is the only way to appreciate the joy and warmth that comes with love , the psychedelic doomful instrumental track Lucifer's chorale is a wondrous interlude to my Favorite track of them all W.L.S.T.D with horror classic keyboards  sabbathy guitars,and Valo's  sinfully dark baritone we are lead into the abyss ,to be overwhelmed with the  beautifully sinister side of love we are seduced by the darkness of it all as the instrumental track Kiss the void brings this journey to an end with is mythic beauty as it closes you can hear the stop botton pressed on a cassette player and the journey is over .

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed out loud several times in reading this book, to the point, that my husband was like, &#34;what's so funny&#34;? I could relate to her despite me being part of the average middle class world and not part of Tina Fey's famous world. I just haven't been &#34;discovered&#34; yet. It was undoubtedly one of the best books I have read in a long time. It was funny and had some emotional moments, but nothing too tear-jerking, because it's Tina Fey. You never know where your life may end it and she is proof of that one for sure, but in a very good humble &#34;girl next door&#34; kind of way.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|I tried to install this app to my Nexus 7 pad, but I kept getting an error message - something about a payment problem.

B008XKSW7M|4.0|I was expecting this film to be really crude based on the trailer, That's why it took me so long to decide to watch it. As it turns out basically all the dirty parts are in the trailer. I have two kids, one is a newborn. I laughed, I cried, it was good:)
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This book will keep you up all night....you will start avoiding getting anywhere near storm drains.  The story is cohesive and continues to build in momentum until you are ready to explode ..... I love Stephen King ... he is a genius and can write ANYTHING about ANYTHING ...

0062238868|5.0|Let me start out by saying I am a Marine who has served two combat tours. This book captured the experience of an elite warrior, but unlike others it isn't arrogant. He gives credit to all those who took part in the events. I don't care what your political views are or what you think about the war, that's not what this book is about. This book is about patriotism and love. It addresses the struggles of military life and life as a military spouse. It's not just a list of accolades from an arrogant man, it's a deep look into his life the good and the bad.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|I got this movie bcs I wanted to compare it to the Great Gatsby that just came out May 2013, which I saw.  (BTW I saw the '74 version when it came out 39 ys ago when I was in my 20's).  This movie follows the story line and pretty much the dialogue from the book, but Redford's acting as Jay Gatsby is pretty lame, not much more than a bump on a log IMO.  Settings are softer and more reserved, definitly a sign of the times of the audience.  Worth watching if: 1) you do want to compare it to the 2013 release, 2) you want to know the story line without ready about it.  Leonardo DiCaprio is leagues better as Gatsby, as is the whole 2013 movie.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I'll keep this brief since many others have written much more in-depth reviews: there is no payoff to this book. I read the book over the course of about 2 days, and the entire time I just kept waiting for....something; and it never came. It was good enough to keep me reading, but I found myself reading it more so just to finish it than because I couldn't put it down. The end is especially disappointing, without giving any spoilers, the end just doesn't make sense. The big \\"reveal\\" is something that there are many, many books that already talk about, so it doesn't make sense how this \\"mystery\\" is really supposed to shock us or give us a moment of \\"I didn't see that coming!\\"<br /><br />A last note: Personally, I don't like how Brown interweaves real facts with \\"facts\\" that really are theories, but he presents as facts. Since this is in Fiction, I guess that is allowed. But it takes me out of the story everything that happens.

B008NA3I30|4.0|is not what I expected, but it made me think about it long after it ended and the three leads are fantastic
1451648537|4.0|Pin a medal on Walter Isaacson.  His approach to a daunting, controversial personality and a tangled industry is straightforward and digestible, a chronological account of the rise of Steve Jobs and Apple in the context of the evolution of computer technology.  Since I am no fan of people who achieve their goals through intimidation, I was done with the obnoxious Mr. Jobs within the first hundred pages.  But I kept reading for the fascinating story Isaacson recounts of the milestones of the digital era, how they were accomplished, and what they meant to their creators, the industry, and the world at large.  Isaacson made the basics of technical progression comprehensible without being condescending.  There were only occasional short passages discussing how certain hardware or programming worked that lost me.  To someone more technically savvy, those passages are probably perfectly lucid, as above all, I think Isaacson strives to be clear.<br /><br />Isaacson hews close to his subject.  He presents Jobs with the balanced objectivity of a journalist, neither with adulation nor with dismissal, and with a minimum of psychologizing, philosophizing, or conjecturing on the man's enduring place in the zeitgeist.  He spent large amounts of time with Jobs over a long period, and the assignment couldn't have been easy.  Jobs seems a beast:  abusive, controlling, manipulative, mercurial, delusional, compulsive, treacherous, arrogant, heedless, driven and perfectionistic on an Olympian level.<br /><br />To Jobs' credit, in a complete reversal of his ostensible character, Jobs gave Isaacson unfettered access to his working life and insight into his private life without directing or scrutinizing what Isaacson would write.  But I felt bad for the business world after reading the book.  It doesn't say much for corporate culture that Jobs, brilliant industrial designer, visionary, and salesman that he was, could succeed so spectacularly when he seemed to possess so few elementary human virtues.  Was he a unique phenomenon of the digital world, I asked myself, where human values perhaps might take a back seat to technical wizardry?  Would his alienating personality have propelled him to the top in more collaborative fields, say, education, the arts, or even politics, where he would have had to listen, understand and empathize, and others might have had to put up with him on a more intimate basis?  I wonder.<br /><br />Perhaps the most annoying conceit Isaacson notes is Jobs' and other electronic whiz kids' mantra that their latest computer product is going to \\"change the world.\\"  Anyone who doubts that consumerism is a religion, with its own messiahs, scriptures, and holy grail, need only refer to Isaacson's descriptions of Jobs' ability to whip a crowd into a worshipful frenzy as he unveiled the latest Apple product.  He is like an evangelist offering salvation to the masses.  The computer has certainly made the world different, but has it changed anything?  We are still saddled with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse:  oppression, war, famine, and death.  Computers have alleviated (as well as abetted) some of the suffering, but the digital revolution has not eliminated these evils, nor has it changed human nature for the better; the Seven Deadly Sins are most assuredly still with us as well.<br /><br />Nor are we truly the innovators Jobs and his cohorts would like to believe.  The tablet, Jobs' last triumph before his untimely death, is, after all, redundant--another type of portable computing device.  The U.S. keeps reinventing the computer rather than making something truly new to address the world's needs and troubles.<br /><br />STEVE JOBS left me eager to dig into Isaacson's biography of Albert Einstein, an innovator who did radically alter the world by changing how we perceive the very nature of the universe we inhabit.  In the meantime, I thank Isaacson for increasing my understanding of the virtual culture we navigate.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I expect a little more from a movie with Denzel Washington in it. It did have a good message and ending though.
B00BESFWBY|3.0|Not into surfing so didn't interest me much although it was a nice story. Gerard Butler made the movie, otherwise I wouldn't have watched it.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was a pretty well written and is somewhat interesting story. Saying that; the book was not my cup of tea and I thought it was an OK read.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|You had to really pay attention to this movie or you could miss an important fact. Very educational about the Cival war
B0034G4P9E|4.0|I really like this movie.  Two actors who are, thus far, underappreciated, but very talented.  The story is beatiful.  I love watching this movie and recommending it to others.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Well written, lots of action. Jamie Foxx was excellent in this movie. I would watch it again. Way to much blood for  my liking though,.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. The music is wonderful. It is very funny. George clooney is excellent at his part as is the rest of the cast. I have seen it at least three times and will watch it again over the years.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I LOVED this. I couldn't put it down. Sophie's been my fav author since her first Confessions book and this book proves she's still my fav!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Good book.  I enjoyed the mental health portion of it.  Pat has many OCD tendencies to work through along with his irrational thoughts and memories that his ex-wife would return.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I liked Fringe: the complete first season as well as other seasons. I have watched all the seasons when they were showing live on TV and now watching them again on Amazon instant video. This show is a science fiction show and being a scientist I like it more as I can relate to things more in it. It has one new story in each episode and then there is a background story which makes it very interesting. Acting, editing, special effects, the lab setting are all very good and make the show very tight. It has a good humor as well. Amazon has a good instant video collection and due to that I am able to watch my favorite shows again. Thanks, Amazon.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is fun to play and advances at a rate that keeps you engaged.  A lot of fun and really addicting
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is simple to play and competitive. At the same time. I like to play it once or twice a week. It records your high scores which is a nice feature.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be about an airline crash and a pilot who landed it in heroic fashion.  I'm not sure what this movie aimed to accomplish.  It was really about alcoholism.  I think. The pilot was a full blown addict, alcoholic who had alienated his family and everyone else with his drinking and drugging.  The movie was all over the place, with a little bit of this and little bit of that thrown in to really confuse a viewer.  Like me.  Was really confused when Whip, the drunk pilot, went to see his co pilot in the hospital who first seemed angry he ended up severely injured in a crash, which was not caused by the pilot's drinking at all.  But then, the co pilot suddenly spouts cult like religion stuff, that the crash was pre ordained, with his young wife joining in with &#34;praise Jesus, praise Jesus&#34;.  Ok.  Whip, the drunk pilot, briefly takes in a young female addict, trying to get clean, who quickly leaves when she discovers what a mess he is.  Once she walks out, that storyline is abandoned.  Then there's Whip's drunken drug pushing friend.  When he enters a scene, rock music, The Stones, I think it was, is blared, like this guys really cool and going to take the movie in a hip upbeat direction instead and get the plot and viewer out of the depressing downward spiral the movie has become.<br /><br />This is a movie without a clear plot line or reason to be.  I rented it thinking it was about an airline crash.  It's not about an jet passenger plane crash, that's for sure.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I'm not a avid reader so this is very unusual for me to just pick up book and get lost in the story. Being from south Jersey the author did a great job in incorporating land marks of New Jersey and Philadelphia.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have this on my iPhone and I love it once I found out they have it on here I was so excited
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|I just found this band, and I like their sound. Great guitar sound and drums. I like that the vocals have a minimum of growling. Not a fan of that in modern hard rock. I would definitely recommend this band, and I have.
B00847KFDS|5.0|True revitalization of songs of a generation. I bought this on a digital copy and shipped my dad the CD. He and I can enjoy this together.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|simple game, from the looks of it but it takes some finesse.  lots of fun and laughter.  I highly recommend it
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I'm so glad I read the book before I saw the movie.  Forget the movie and just read the book.  The movie takes scenes out of the book, but doesn't quite pull them together.  The book gives you the whole story and was a great read!
1878424505|5.0|I got turned on to this subject when I was having dinner the other night with one of my closest friends. The idea behind being impeccable with your words (or how to be impeccable with your word) really fascinated me.<br />So many people have referred to this book, I just had to get it. I cut a video of this and wanted to share it with the rest of y'all out there in Internet Land.<br />My thoughts about this are located at my blog http://www.empowernetwork.com/fastfreedomnow/being-impeccable-with-your-words/ or go straight to the video I cut here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvqDhCSzUIc
B009NY43NY|4.0|The book was as good as the rest. I forgot some of the characters and they were not detailed as usual, but I liked that.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|To appeciate this album you need to avoid all distractions and sit in a room and listen start to finish. Feel ever beat, hear every note. If Great Gig in the Sky does not give you chills you need to check your pulse. David, Roger, Richard, and Nick created a masterpiece that is unbeatable. First heard it the year it was release and I have heard it on every format available.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Pure musical joy! If you are a guitarist at any any level you will enjoy this DVD. Solid smokin performances from the entire band. Highly recommended!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I'm a huge Quell fan and have both prior versions; knowing the quality of those apps, the PREVIEW VIDEO ALONE just blew me away. Will update later if it turns out to disappoint - but I sure doubt it. Excellent effort to recruit former players as well as intrigue new ones .
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game will provide you with hours of sattisfying gameplay. Lots of species and variety, it makes every playthrough different. Well worth the price.
B0091VTISO|5.0|I have seen both versions, this one and Arnold's and this one is more appealing, of course this is done more recently and it should be, but to me the story was much better and of course they could not have gotten it better using Jason Momoa. After seeing him in Game of Thrones, and this he is a very talented actor who is definitely visually appealing to my eyes, I will continue to look for other things he has been in. FYI, I did end up going out and buying this movie also.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a good writer and storyteller. It is amazing how he can intertwine the lives of all his characters. I read the book in two days.
B005HSL626|3.0|I believe this is more oriented for younger people (who are bored) or children (more so), I really was not able to keep my attention span on this to play it to its full capability, so a OK is all it can get from me.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|This book was entertaining, but lacked a lot of details about China during this time that I was hoping for.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|After hearing all the chatter about the Game of Thrones series, I finally decided to see what it was all about.  No fan of fantasy, I had not read any since I finished all of Tolkien.  I gave it a three because it is not literature, but I would give it a five for addiction. I finished  the first about three weeks ago and am nearly done with number five. The way Martin structures the book(s) is a little jerky, almost a series of short stories that often require the reader to link them together into a continuum.  LOTS of characters to keep straight on a huge geographic scale.  Sort of a fun read.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Really action packed. Can't wait for part 2 to come out. Interested to see what he will do next with himself since his love died
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've loved this series up until the most recent few books.  Yes, I'm an Eric fan, but just because things didn't go my way isn't the reason i disliked this last book.  The author had many things in this book that didn't seem coherent with the rest of the series and some leaps she made just to make her ending work for her.  She didn't get a proper resolution to the Eric relationship and I find it hard to believe that after she'd been in so deep with Eric that she'd just be so okay with it all ending. The final HEA seems almost forced since she'd always seen him in a different light than that, or at least that's what we'd been led to believe and to add insult to injury her previous relationships were tossed aside as that maybe she isn't so ok with the whole vampire thing as she thought she was.  Completely opposite to how she'd been before.  Maybe it's that I'd expected something so awful as this last book after reading the one prior, but it left me kind of in shock about how an author can so mutilate characters her readers have come to love to force the story in a direction she says she'd planned out, but just seems to be contrived and forced.  I think the series just went on too long and she didn't even want to write this last book.  I still cannot believe they are putting out yet another book.  Yes, I will probably read it, I guess I'm a masochist that way, but I think for now I'm going to stick with my Anita Blake books, I'd found while waiting for the 11th book of this series to come out.  At least generally with that I feel like the author still likes her characters even after writing the 14 novels I've read so far.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is freaking awesome! I love how you can switch between hidden object scenes or play mahjong. The graphics are great and the little sparkly areas make sure you don't get stuck. There's also an in game strategy guide to help if need be. This is my second g5 games and I love it. It is a little pricey but it appears to be well worth it.
B00AYPXG5W|5.0|This it the best alien abduction movie of all time in my opinion.  It is very suspenseful and makes you think!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good game for the genre  my son is really enjoying it. It is a  good simulator of the deals arcade game...
B00CW665VI|5.0|I like my reviews short and sweet, so here it goes. This one is a keeper! I loved having the male's point of view throughout the book . He offers a sense of honesty that other books lack. He tells it how it is. Refreshing read. Do yourself a favor and read this one.
B007E68HFI|4.0|Book was required for my exceptional student class-I haven't read it yet but all my classmates at its a good and easy read
B005COO1X6|3.0|No explanation which I guess is typical King. Glad to read a \\"normal\\" King again.I'll read another now.<br />I'd recommend.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I just about wore out Pandora, where I discovered the free preview, while waiting for my pre-ordered CDs to arrive in the mail. I bought an extra as a gift to a friend, but opened mine to play in my truck's stereo. I took a long trip today and listened (and sung along), over and over, repeating track 5, \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\", every time. The artists who joined John are all favorites too, especially Mr. Morello, who politicizes the important messages (for everyone).<br /><br />This isn't about making money, obviously, because of the low, low price, but for the messages, music, and the fellowship among artists. The music was great company on a 200 mile trip, but I would have enjoyed it more with someone else along with whom to share my stories from when the music was new (and I was younger). I also LOVED the new songs!<br /><br />Music IS the sound track of our lives, and the update with other artists is a welcome addition. I might add, too, that the CD jacket is worth reading a few times!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I have always loved and will always love them.  Their range is awesome.  Another great work of art and in concert they are wonderful..
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This was a good lesson in history. Daniel Day-Lewis did an excellent job of portraying<br />Lincoln. I liked the end in the alternate theatre.  Sally Field also did a great job,
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Got this because I was seeing them in person and they are awesome sounds just like the CD love it!!!!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I really enjoy the Stargate series. Getting to watch it in series and episodes is awesome. Looking forward to season 3
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Funny, I love the landscapes and birds. It helps to relieve stress. I recommend to leave the routine. play with the family
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Immerse yourself in a bygone era and experience the moods, the emotions, the confusion and secrecy of the characters.<br />Detail description of scenery, buildings, fashion and people are vital to adding to the fascination of any story.<br />This story takes you back in time to a life of amazing events, with twists and turns and an unforgettable ending.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Sometimes you can't get the coins on the trains and I am not getting the stuff I need in the mystery boxes all I get is coins and stuff I don't need plus they barely change the scenery and I have thought  about deleting the game DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a great series. I was nice having the entire season together rather than weekly. I am ready for season 4.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The best of 12 I have read so far,might as well read the rest<br />Maybe a better one is out there with its thumb stuck in the air
B004N66XYE|3.0|I may be jaded because I just finished Downton Abbey. I was surprised that there were fewer episodes than expected.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Nothing else really needs to be said about this movie except - MORE - If this was just a start, first I cant wait for a full blown backed movie that can give it all the backing it should have.  This was/is a very well made and entertaining movie, a must watch and you'll have to own it afterwards !
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Just goes on and on! Some parts were so long and drawn out ....and then it would get  again...just a hard read
159102594X|5.0|The first Joe Abercrombie book I have read, but after reading The First Law: Book One I purchased the rest of the series.<br /><br />Very clever writing and colorful characters... not just hack-n-slash fantasy (although the fight scenes are excellent) but a unique cast of characters in a world very much like our own (Angland?).  Some of the characters include Glokta the Torturer, Logen the Northman, Bayaz the Magi.<br /><br />I grew up reading Lord of the Rings, Forgotten Realms & Dragonlance fantasy novels and more recently Gene Wolfe.  The Blade Itself continues in that vein but spends more time exploring the moral decisions and development of its characters.  The plot is overshadowed by the dynamic and life-like characters.  Excellent!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I watched one after another...each season continued with quality performances.  It draws you in and makes you feel as though you are there...LOVED ALL OF THEM
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use Battery HD on my Kindle Fire. I love the convenience of knowing how many hours I have left to read or watch a movie. Also I like the customizable graphics.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Not as haunting as, but much more mysterious than, SHARP OBJECTS (and way more credible than GONE GIRL).  I certainly had no idea who did what until the very end!<br />Character development in this story was good, especially Patty and Diondra.<br />I worry sometimes about reading murder mysteries and/or bestsellers: some can be so shallow, or can pretend to be twisted to the point of idiocy. I hate feeling as if I've wasted my time reading a book, since there may have been so many others worthy of my time. This book was a good balance of character, prose, and plot, and is worthy of any reader's time.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I don't know if it's the App Store or Quell but....I bought it, installed it and it wouldn't open. I uninstalled it, re installed it and it still won't open.  I should mention that I also had to update the App store at the same time.<br />UPDATE:<br />Quell Memento still won't open on my phone LG Motion Android 4.04 BUT it does work on my Kindle Fire HD and it is wonderful! It is by far my favorite Quell. I love it!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works well so far. Have only used to convert into mp3's - a dozen or so. No sign of previously mentioned ads so hopefully those have been removed.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is a great read. Characters well defined and good depth to storyline.  Well written in the manner of the present and the past lives of the people in the book.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My daughter loves this app. It is very easy for her to use. She is 3. And she can switch between colors easily. She really enjoys playing with it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A very unique movie.  It looks at psycology thru sexuality, in the life on a man completely paralyzed with polio.  It is rather odd watching a whole movie with a main character named Mark who looks at you sideways the whole time (due to his polio paralysis he is on a gurney or in a bed constantly).<br /><br />Even though he may be considered \\"useless\\" by today's standards, he touched the lives of everyone he knew... There is more to the human spirit than economic success.<br /><br />It is funny and entertaining, especially the parts where he speaks with the priest, (William H. Macy-great in so many diverse roles), about his \\"sexual\\" experiences; and the \\"therapy\\"\\" sessions.<br /><br />Helen Hunt looked different, her face seemed rather poofy/baggy, but otherwise she is aging gracefully.  Another reviewer wondered why it was necessary to show a full frontal of Helen Hunt naked.  It is my belief that it was to show us what Mark was seeing, so we could empathise better.  (Also, maybe that's what Hunt has to do to get a decent paycheck these days?)  I have noticed in recent movies, that there is at least one full frontal shot(mostly female but some male).<br /><br />Reminds me of the sexual movements of the 70s (though I wasn't around then), if you've seen 70's movies, they also unabashedly used nudity bc it is natural after all, not ANYTHING to be ashamed of (though individually something to be revered and protected).<br /><br />I like that the movie forces us to think about sexuality for what it truly is (rather than the way narrow-minded society shoves down our throat--no pun intended) as a complement to feel-good human emotions, not the only means to happiness.  It reminds us that there is more to life. Which is funny cuz its mostly about one man's journey to being sexual.  What he really is searching for is real personal intimacy not just sex.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I didn't like looking at facebook on my kindle until I got this app. It is great. I would recommend
B003VANOFY|4.0|Software crashes some of the programs I run(their all up to date just incompatible). I can hear mic noise in the headset even when the mic is muted (not a big issue just annoying). 7.1 sounds awesome especially while gaming, very comfortable even in extended wearing, love the volume dial easy to use.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app. I use it on my Kindle fire all the time. It is very user friendly. I would recommend
B0067Q42BY|5.0|it's a fast paced easy fun game with different styles of play. Great and color and graphics. good to relax with. Janet B
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. World community and human rights activists should do something about North Korea. I wish all the best to the main character of this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|FREE is great! No annoying pop ups!!! Highly recommended. Great Colors. So far no glitches with this app and did I mention the best part???---FREE!!!
0618154043|5.0|It had lots of info, things I needed to flesh out the other Tolkien stories. I found it an entertaining way to spend a sunny afternoon reading and rocking in my porch swing.
0553288105|2.0|well, I had high hopes for this one, I am a keen reader of all things Asimov.<br />yet this book never clicked, I read it anticipating something to be good it never came to be.<br /><br />The idea started nicely but the author really wanted for us to feel the different species, going so overbored that you couldn't connect to the characters or relate to them...<br />in the end there is a nice idea behind the book, would have made a very good short story but I fear not novel worthy.<br /><br />I am sad to say that I don't recommend the book,
B003UYUP58|5.0|It is an amazing book, which provides hop and at the same time focus on the reality of our quest in finding a cure for cancer. I loved the honesty of the author.
B009NI46F0|3.0|There were a couple of laugh out loud moments, but not too many.  There were many &#34;Oh my God's&#34; which for me is irreverent and tiring.  The lead character learns important lessons, the best of which is &#34;don't let others trample on your aspirations&#34;, but the over the top girly-girl stuff gave my basketball-playing daughter nightmares.  If you like lots of pink, pumps with diamond studded hearts, and chihuahuas, then maybe this movie is for you.  But for me, hind sight says there were better choices.
B0078XFYDA|3.0|Lively treatment for the believing billions of theists and ammo for the fearless few!<br />in god or gods we do not trust.<br />l
0143038583|4.0|An eye-opening expose of the processed food industry. The reader will learn about how food is prepared for his plate.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|This album rocks. Amazing drummer, key board, and guitar. The singer and lyrics are good, but the musicians are incredible.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome! If you are a science teacher.....you gotta read this. The problem solving skills he used and his sarcasm made this book especially readable. Once you start, you do not want to put it down!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was totally absorbed in it. Loved the characters,  and the way they were worked into history.  I jumped immediately into the sequel and was absorbed in that as well.  Can't wait to read the final book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Funny, everyday life. Great job. It's nice to read about everyday life. Put a smile on my face and my husband's.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The turmoil and horrors of this time in history were dealt with very well, considering the complexities.  The characters brought it all to life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its fun and hard somtimes my famliy loves it they bagg me to let them play it.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|The man that can play a guitar!  My husband can never get enough of him. He has been a fan for years
B00594XOZU|4.0|My best friend has this app. You can do memes, sketches, videos, and stuff. I mean, this is still kik, but we need the updated version. I hope this was helpful.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Great Album.  He did it right and put the focus on the older blues makes.  The making of this album couldn't have been more timely; six of these old legends died just after the recordings.  This album/documentary's grammy nominations and awards were well deserved.<br /><br />The CD arrived earlier than anticipated and was in great condition.  I would buy from this seller again.
044042321X|5.0|The graphic novel was quite impressive for someone enthralled with Game of Thrones. Beautiful drawings and very capable choices for which scenes to render. Loved it. Waiting for the next installment.
1401307450|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers has been my favorite band since high school. I had this book but it had been read a few times and it got water damage, this one was a replacement. Read this new copy when I got it and was happy to have a fresh copy. Its about Anthony Kiedis and his journey through life and at one point starting the band Red Hot Chili Peppers as the lyricist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wondered during the award ceremonies what the big deal was with this show. I decided to check it out and was pleasantly surprised. I can't wait for the next season!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not bad really, I wouldn't mind a little more building options in the game. It's okay other than that. The city bucks are a bit hard, I rather not spend my own mon ey.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series of books. I do lose track of the characters at times since the book skips around a lot. Book 4 left two big cliff hangers and I couldn't wait to dive into Book 5.  The hard covers are huge and pretty heavy so I was glad to get them on Kindle. I bought the whole series now because I need to go back and re-read all the books. I wish sixth book was published because I just finished 5.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think you sld get this app beacuse one it is relly fun and let me tell you my story...one day I was in corpus w/ my aunt and I was decorating her phone and I saw the app and started to play it and I loved it so I decided to get it on my own kindle fire and my phone so I cld play it!!!
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Jack Reacher IS 6'5&#34; and 240 pounds of mean.  Tom Cruise is not.  Jack Reacher can beat the crap out of 5 guys, Tom Cruise cannot!<br />Cruise is NOT Reacher!
B003OEO7CQ|5.0|I bought this for my sister and she loves it! It came in great condition including the case and works extremely well!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Best cd I have bought in a long time.  It is hard to find albums these days where nearly every single is excellent
B0063IH60K|4.0|My first download and experience with my Kindle. I made a good choice to begin my journey in the Amazon world.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|Even though I read the reviews, I never expected this to be AS HEAVY as it was.  After one camping trip the black finish was all chipped off from splitting branches.  Finish not very durable...
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great book. I can't wait for the next book of the series. And  I hope that this author has other series books
B001U9BRNE|5.0|You'll love this Blu-Ray disk- and the wide range of musical stars who appear to sing David's songs.  Entertaining and diverting.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The premise for the story was interesting, but it took me a while to get into the story. In the beginging it was slow read.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Decided to snag this since I just picked up a 3DS XL and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Definitely a must have for those pesky underwater missions! Those water beasts don't stand a chance now! &#62;:)<br /><br />Some other reviews stated that the extra Circle Pad on the unit had to be broken in a little bit before it felt normal, I was fortunate enough where it didn't feel grainy or loose at all, it felt just like the one on the 3DS itself.<br /><br />It IS Region Free! For anyone like myself who was a little worried that it might not work since it's straight from Japan, fear not! Install the battery, pop it on your 3DS and off you go. :)<br /><br />I'll update again down the road when I acquire some more compatible titles.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I generally like the book better than the movie, but it is just the opposite in this novel. There was more details and I like that,but it also slowed down the story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|50 shades you have met your match!!!! Can't wait for the next book to come out. Wish the series was longer!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|not a book I would rave about to my friends.  Felt like it was taking forever to get through.  I didn't like the ending.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse books. I've read every single one of them.. but this book felt rushed. I didn't think all the characters were rapped up appropriately and there was no time to explore all the relationships. I'm trying not to give anything away, I just thought it could have been done SO much better.
B00064WSNM|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it first came out in 1974 and listened to it a LOT back then, and I still do.<br /><br />The percussions and sudden transitions, the guitar and the violin, are breathtaking, and the lyrics, married to the music, are brilliant:<br /><br />\\"All the kids<br />who played the blues<br />Would learn my licks<br />with a bottle neck slide\\"<br /><br />The Night Watch is one of my very favorite songs, ever.<br /><br />\\"They make their entrance one by one<br />Defenders of that way of life<br />The redbrick home, the bourgeoisie<br />And guitar lessons for the wife\\"<br /><br />Simply a great album.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|This is a solid cd from top to bottom. Any Thin Lizzy fan will love this, it is a must have. If you are looking for a great hard rock cd buy this gem.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gave me a much better understanding of why Abraham Lincoln is such a revered figure in American history. Of course, we read in school text books of how he presided over the American Civil War and led the north to eventual victory to preserve the Union. But this book gives a wonderfully colorful narrative on how Lincoln miraculously was able to unite a fractious group of powerful men in his cabinet and lead them (along with a political constituency of Northern radicals, 'copperheads' and common men) to victory over the south. It revealed Lincoln's political savvy, magnanimity and prescience in a very interesting and readable way. Highly recommended read!
B001XV09UG|4.0|The video was as intriguing as the title was confusing. It began as a normal story then took many twists and turns through mentally challenging scenes. I watched it hoping I would reach a point where it all came together but that didn't happen. At least the end was a \\"they lived happily ever after\\" pleasure.
B00908DDZM|5.0|There is ample stuff here for those that like the mainstream pop rap but some of the songs dwell deeper into unchartered waters. And that is what makes this album stand out for me personally.<br /><br />You don't hear very many &#34;Same Love&#34; or &#34;Neon Cathedral&#34; type of lyrics being written or sung especially by rappers. For once rap music dwells on something more substantial and defies convention and for that alone this album deserves an extra star but alas I am limited to the standard 5 :)
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I like the Ice Age movies, great for kids and adults.  A great movie to watch for a good laugh.
159463176X|4.0|Love, loved, loved The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, so was really looking forward to another great novel. Although the story was good, it was not up to the caliber of those other great books. I found the book choppy with jumping around from family member to family member and past and present. I enjoyed reading about the history of Afghanistan, but the prior books were so much better.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I do like playing this game. It makes you think about what your last two movers were and what your next one is going to be.<br />I was really surprised, when I went to look at the different types of scores, to see my name mom the top 100 out of all over the world.<br />That made me feel good. I guess I'm not all that common.<br />Here you thought I was going to say \\"I'm not all that dumb.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I really liked this movie but I had to watch it a couple times to like it. The filming is a little dark and it took me a couple times to warm up to it.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|When I first got it I wasn't sure how to make it stand upright but watching the video really helped. This case is super awesome and I'm glad I bought it for my kindle.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great premise for the story.  Both likeable and unlikable characters and lots of action and suspense. What's not to like? Am ready for the next installment!
B000SZHCIA|5.0|Chet Baker voice conveys an innocence and vulnerability that is lost in today's pop music. I probably sound old, but I remember a time when vocalists set the mood instead of describing all the dirty details. True classic from an under-appreciated talent.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I am enjoying this game because it helps you along and rewards quickly. While I am not yet certain how cash dependent the game is; I will play for a long while just to improve kingdom.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This latest soundtrack of soon to be classics from the Boz is beautiful. After seeing him in concert recently for the first time, I think he has only mellowed with age & stays relevant with his easy to listen to songs....thumbs up fom this fan!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Beautifully shot, evocative, well-acted, Ang Lee's adaptation turns a story of the unspeakable horror of human possibility into a quasi- philosophical inquiry into the metaphysics of human:animal interaction-love of father and son and the role of the supporting but doomed Mother. Gorgeous to look at. Fascinating the first time through but finally shallow and somewhat confused,
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A good old rambling who done it with plenty of action and twists. A true page turner that keeps you on the edge.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Although listed by Amazon as a Quick time movie player, this app will not play Quick time movies without additional purchases.
0553328255|4.0|For real Sherlock Holmes fans I highly recommend buying this along with the Jeremy Brett- Granada series dvd's.<br /><br />Remember that some of &#34;Doyle's&#34; stories fell flat,  that's okay,  it accentuates the better one's.  This is an inexpensive way to enjoy hours of entertainment by the master sleuth.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I can't stress enough how much I love this game. It is the best app ever. You will be endlessly addicted to this game. The full version is worth the money. Again, it's AMAZING!!!!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|If you're a trek fan and especially if you have the other trek dvd's you won't be disappointed with adding this movie,  especially at the very nice price it's being offered at.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love the strategy in this game.  I would enjoy more communication with allied forces.  other than that this is one of my favorite kindle games.  If you like action, it is filled with it.  During off time you can do strategy to make your base stronger
B008Y73940|5.0|This movie really takes An alternative look being a lawyer, it really shows the moral dilemmas faced by Attorneys.  On one hand client deserves fair and impartial trial on the other There is the internal desire to seek justice served
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|If you have read the book, you will be disappointed in this movie.  The storyline only vaguely follows the storyline of the book.  In the book, the characters are richly developed, in the movie they are shallow and do not capture your attention.  I wish I had saved my money.  The book however is gripping, and full of suspense, romance, and intrigue.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a book full of action that will keep you on your toes. Plus tons of love and romance<br />Drhoades77@aol.com
1609419693|5.0|If you like Tina Fey's witty style then you will like this. Interesting inside info about her life and experiences.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every moment spent reading this book took me to a fully immersive world. Excellent character development and solid plot. A+++
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I consider myself an esigent fantasy reader.<br />I've found this book unexpectedly good.<br />I eagerly expexct to read more from this author.
0385536828|5.0|This is an extraordinary and complex love story, told with unusual craftsmanship. Love arises in beauty, desire, self-knowledge, intrigue, anxiety, betrayal, and ultimately, in the ability to inhabit the very thoughts and feelings of another person. And, let's face it, McEwan can write. I listened to the book on Audio, and was blown away by Juliet Stevenson's phrasing. Highly recommended.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm impressed with this game. It's simple, yet addictive, and it's easy to earn coins with the right vehicle and map combination. With new features (unlockable, not paid), this app could become even better.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a really clever, campy, and unique show. Sorry I didn't know about it when it was on so I could have supported it...
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is okay. It is basically like most other matching games. It's a little too fast paced if you want to relax and after so many times you have wait to play again. Plus having to pay money for extras isn't why I downloaded this game. I don't feel anyone should have to keeping paying money for a game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I purchased this book because I am a classroom special education paraprofessional and we were reading it in sophomore English class.  I hadn't seen the movie prior to purchasing, so the story was new to me.  A great, profound read!
B008NABUU8|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. I definitely think it is worth the money. Both my husband and 10-year-old daughter enjoy it!!!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I chose this rating because I just bought the Hefty Pack of Bucks, was charged $24.99 and I have not received the game cash in the game! I am FURIOUS!!! Went to the help section and its no help at all. Looked for contact info, couldn't find anything. Now I can't cancel the order and I'm out the $25, I have never been madder at a game in my life!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This is a fun game and challenging. Both I and my 10-year-old daughter enjoy it! The song choices are great!
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Too many cutaways to Lincoln telling whimsical stories. Would have liked a little more battle scenes. Tommy Lee Jones the best actor in the movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this Alarm Clock! As far as I can tell my Kindle Fire doesn't have an alarm, so this is what I use to wake myself up. I like the way it looks, I like the easy options and the sounds to wake up to. One of the best purchases I've boughten, I'm one very happy customer!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This practical and User friendly app is almost like having a commercial key pad calc.  Love that the numbers and function keys take up most of the screen. Practical and a breeze to use.  Very happy with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had no expectations when I bought this book, but based on the reviews it sounded worthwhile.  It definitely was!  I read it in 3 sittings and if I hadn't had to deal with work or life in general it would have been 1!  It was engaging and witty and the characters burrowed themselves into your heart within the first few meetings.  I especially loved the relationship between Sky and Six because it reminded me so much of how my bff and I interact. There were twists and turns I wasn't expecting and all in all it was highly enjoyable! I recommend this book wholeheartedly!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great movie. Not like the book but still fun to watch. I would watch it again and suggest a friend watch it too!
B000URWYTS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of a very eventful part of the life of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Growing up with bits and pieces of the history of his life, it was refreshing to read a full accounting of what actually happened.  He was a very significant architect of the early part of the 20th century and the book is well written.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|It performs simple operations, but sometimes it does not recognize division in the form of a ratio. I have to put the division sign, other than that it works fine.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I went to a few other online sources before finding this guide; only to be confused and/or anxious about trying to publish for Kindle. After reading this book I am confident and excited about publishing and will recommend this book to anyone else who needs help.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I really don't use it that much, but when I do it works fine. It is not the best one though.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I'm not generally a fan of horror, but like most people I've always loved the character of Hannibal Lecter. And while Clarice is also a singular character, I was always drawn to Will Graham and Lecter's relationship - and especially William Peterson's portrayal in Manhunter (one of my favorite movies). So I was thrilled to hear Bryan Fuller was working on this project, and that he was focusing on the earliest part of this relationship. I've not been disappointed. The show is smart, compelling, creepy, and yes, gory. But not without purpose. This is no torture-porn, except perhaps psychologically (poor Will). The casting is perfect, the cinematography and art design are beautiful, and so far the series is taut, compelling, intelligent, and just gorgeous. Hannibal's suits by costume designer Christopher Hargadon and the food styling by Janice Poon are reasons to watch alone!<br /><br />I've seen many comparisons to The Following, but I couldn't watch more than two episodes of that. That show is filled with woefully two-dimensional stock characters who claimed to be brilliant but in the end were, as I read in a review, \\"two dim bulbs punching each other out in a warehouse.\\" Hannibal is helmed by a creative and intelligent creator with a strong r&eacute;sum&eacute; filled with interesting, surprising character. His Hannibal is filled with characters who are believably brilliant, which makes it even more thrilling when they fail to see the killer under their nose.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen is sublime as the charming, empathetic, refined Dr. Lecter. He's more subtle than Hopkins' portrayal, to be sure, but you still feel his hidden power and danger, like a python coiled beneath Lecter's skin. I always loved Hopkins' Lecter, but I never really felt so the connection and empathy as I do with Mikkelsen. Even though it's clear who and what Hannibal is, we still want to be his friend as badly as poor Franklin. It's no mystery why the other characters are under his spell.<br /><br />Hugh Dancy is perfect as a young Will Graham, unraveling after a particularly difficult case. This portrayal is also unexpected, shown in the time before we met him and before, according to book canon, he was in a psychiatric hospital. He is increasingly vulnerable as he dives deeper and deeper in the psyches of psychopaths, yet we know he is powerful, and in a way that frightens him. His awkward mannerisms are convincing, not forced, in Dancy's hands, especially considering what Will is capable of. I'd hide in a house with just dogs to keep me company, too. Hettiene Park was a wonderful surprise to me, as I'd hadn't seen her in anything before. Her chemistry with Will is fantastic. It's hard in television to be a \\"no-nonsense\\" female character without falling into stereotype, and she easily skirts that danger with humor and intelligence. Lastly, Caroline Dhavernas is understated yet magnetic as Will's friend and colleague Dr. Alana Bloom. I think she is, so far, underused as a friend and possible romantic interest, but Dhavernas clearly has more to give to the role if Fuller allows her character to grow.<br /><br />Even if you don't normally watch horror, give this a shot. It's dark, gorgeous, and one of the most exciting things on television.<br />Hugh Dancy is perfect as a young Will Graham, unraveling after a particularly difficult case.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love being able to watch at my leisure, great picture and sound quality .  To order is quick and painless, so easy and you can start to watch your shows immediately .
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Being a scientist and geek, I find the Big Bang theory a complete laugh riot. This season is no different and they keep getting better. The scientific jokes are prevalent but there is a substantial increase in innuendos to the naivety of scientists in day to day life.<br />Enjoy!
B00271DNP4|5.0|the movie is faithful to the book's main points, altho of course some of the interesting but not pivotal events were deleted. all in all, a good flick.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Keeps you on your toes and makes you fall in love with Sookie the characters all over again!! Loved it!!!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I got this to make a pair of Bluetooth headphones and it works very nice ( I use it with a Tao Tronics Bluetooth Audio Dongle Receiver) and they work great together. I have not used it much as I am still waiting to get a new set of headphones so I don't know much about battery life but I have not had any problems with mine. Thank you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is so much better then the movie was<br />they cut to much out that it wasn't that exciding maybe if I hadn't read the book first , but I was disappointed in it .
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a quick read. The man, Tesla, is fascinating, although I am not sure the content supports the conclusion
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy is one of those records that, if anyone says they don't like it they are either lying or they've not heard it. One of the best rock or pop albums of its era, it inspired hundreds of artists and musicians. For me, it is the best British rock album of the time along side Sgt. Peppers and Aqualung. My favourite album of all is Chuck Berry's After School Session but Tommy comes second with just a few at second.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I had been waiting months since quell reflect and its finally here. Quell in itself was great, reflect was so awesome i played it start to finish 3 full times. And this is just another leap. Graphics and music are both incredibly done but with the new &quot;story&quot; it is off the hook. Is not just a raindrop in house any more. Puzzles are there, perfection or better is there, but now the puzzles have more goals and its all wrapped up in the memories of the narration. Do yourself a favor and buy this now.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I'm still reading the collection, and I'm enjoying it.  An issue that apparently other Kindle versions have is a non-existing/non-function Table of Contents - this version does not have that problem.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Very scary, very creepy...I will definately watch. Season 2. This is nothing like any television series I have seen before..
B00821PCJS|5.0|The first two seasons of this show are great with good acting and an interesting plot.  Can't wait for season three!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Apparently, unlike any other standard Micro USB Cables, the Amazon Kindle ones are the only ones which reliably physically work with Amazon Kindles, even though there are no obvious differences between the two.  This product works!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer has done it again.  Far and away my favorite author.  Please get the next book out as soon as possible!
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|Adult entertainment for sure.......HBO always has the best series. Love that amazon has it easily available. Hope season two is even better!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I found this book disappointing.  The first two books were page turners with interesting stories and interesting characters.  This one had more to do with politics than storyline and somehow the same characters became boring.  It took me a while to get into and I basically had to force myself to read a few pages each night.  The only interesting part came at the end of the book and now you can see there will be a fourth book.  I'm not sure if I will read it.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I watch this on television already and I feel this is one of the best shows out there. I downloaded this particular episode because it was pulled off air.
B003B02O14|3.0|Book is a good read but not believable.  Main character is too perfect.  Half way through the book I knew how it was going to end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome.so much fun. If u love horse this games for u. Try it you will love it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Very entertaining - Love the idea of Sherlock in a modern context. Solid acting and storylines. I watch very few TV shows but I'm hooked on this one!
B006FE83U4|5.0|One of the best loved novels of it's time, comes to life with power and force with no other than Gregory Peck.  Robert Duvall and Alice Ghostley have cameos in the movie.  Amazing work of art, story telling, and suspense.  It takes a real good look at depression era deep south living, prejudice and  moral values.  The court room scene still makes me shiver and weep.  One of the best movies ever made, and one of the best movies ever acted, by botht the child stars and a adults.  Gripping and haunting.  Read the book first, and then tune in give this a watch.  Not disappointing in its translation from book to screen.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Why does every cop have a bad boss. I have had many bosses in my life and most are good people. Of course sometimes their agenda differs from mine but Harry Bosch has the worst bosses in the country. The next book maybe he could get transferred and have a boss who is not a complete evil dimwit
B006BG7RI0|5.0|One of the best pictures ever.  This boxed set comes with a picture perfect Blu-ray version, and tons of little extras only made for the collector of this fine film.  If you are looking for just movie, pass up this product.  This is really just for the collector.  A keeper.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Very well written and researched book about what it is like to live in North Korea.  Captivating, yet horrifying at the same time.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|It's the same as taking a picture...you don't really need this app because even though you can change the format off stuff u can already do that. It seems to me that it only wastes space...
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Another great Ringo All Star Line up.  Todd Rundgren, Steve Lukather, Gregg Rollie, Plus others.  Some great Santana hits from Rollie, Some great Toto from Lukather, And of course Todd doing his thing.  And can't leave out Ringo doing his tunes plus some Beatles stuff.
0767020308|5.0|Wonderful performances from a great cast. Great choice of scenes and dialog from the book. It truly captured the essence of one of our great novels.
B002XXNSF6|1.0|I fast forwarded through most of it, hoping to get to the &#34;the interesting parts&#34;.  It never happened.  Completely bored.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is such a faithful version of the Jane Austen novel! l thought Amanda Root did a wonderful job, as of course did Ciaran Hinds, and the whole loathsome Elliott family.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Continually freezes or locks up. When it's not acting up, it's fun. Very difficult to acquire all collection items for each room. I've been playing for over six months and still haven't completed any room.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Even better than the first one. It was less gloomy, with more fantasy. I was creeped out but very impressed by the angel-prophet character, and loved the performance by the legless dwarf. Also loved the love song scene with Hellboy and Abe Sapien!
0385349947|5.0|I wish this book and movement had been available when I first started my career in theological education.  How difficult that journey has been!  Had I only had the courage to lean in at the faculty table my story would likely be so different.  While many would say I've achieved much, what they don't see is the self-doubt that lurks within.<br /><br />Sandberg's word to women is simple, yet powerful and affirming.  This should be required reading for all young women at the beginning of their vocation.  The hope that Sandberg offers is that it is not too late for those of us who've been around a while---we can still lean in WITH CONFIDENCE.<br /><br />Thank you Sheryl Sandberg!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Not the most interesting of the Harry Potter series, and probably the most depressing of Rowling's efforts.  Having said that, I found it a well done development of the story, leading up to the thrilling climax.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|i thought this book was amazayn one direction is phenominiall there baby pics are extrordinharry there childhoods almost seem really fabulouis this book is brilliam.  reccomended to all directioners  (DONT BUY KINDLE VERSION!!!)  (GO HARRY)
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This is what I consider the original computer nerd film.  We get to see a computer programmer live out his dream.  The special effects may look cheesy by today's standard but they were state of the art when this film was made.
B0072OFM28|4.0|there was some sticky substance in the case and hard to take out of the sleeve, but the DVD was good
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Yes the movie rocked.....It has action, some simple moments, and of course it was the directors second film!!! But if u like super heros film this is a must have!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|After reading and enjoying the first twelve books, I was looking forward to an exciting ending. This was not the case. There could have been better closure to this series. At the very least, an epilogue would have been nice, showing Sookie and Sam happily married with children, instead of leaving the reader guessing about their future. ( For that matter, Sookie could have even ended up with Quinn or Alcide. She deserved a happy ending.) This was the weakest and most disorganized book in the series.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Was a great movie, I have watched it several times.  It has its funny moments, its serious moments, and definately action.  The action sequences are pretty cool..Would recommend this movie to action movie watchers.  It rates up there.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Many, many sound options to choose from.  Very relaxing.  I lreally like that it has a timer option too.  This is a great app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At less u con turn monsters of not only<br />That it has lots of action me and my brother plays it<br />For it a long time the game is about Steve and<br />Craft stuff and fight mobs so watch out for<br />Those creepers.
B003G4W49C|1.0|This is a very poor book.  As a storyteller OSC writes as a transparent author, hopelessly burying his characters in adult psychology, to the point where the fact that they are children is irrelevant.  So steeped in adult procedure, OSC fails to actually describe children.  If you exclude the explicit references to age, these characters ARE adults. There are moments that are great, but overall read something else.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really fun....me and my 3yr old love to take turns playing this game. this game is additive.  highly recommended .
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|The title says it all. It's a good thing I got this as the free app of the day or I would have been quite upset over my loss of a dollar. I don't think that I have ever encountered controls more unintuitive than what this game has to offer. It does have nice graphics, and if you're willing to put the time and effort into training yourself with these controls, more power to you. Just be warned, by the time you've mastered this, you'll have played every map in every chopper and gotten every achievement in the grind to learn these controls.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just have to give this a 5 star rating, for keeping me entertained longer than other game I have played. &lt;(&deg;&middot;&deg;&lt;) Kirby dancing!!!!
B0050OMJIW|4.0|I re-read this book to see if it has stood the test of time, A classic that everyone should read,
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|First of all, I've seen many versions of Les Miserables, bot movies and stage. I've also read the whole book, and enjoyed it! Second, I understand when adapting something, changes have to be made, fior better or worse.<br />When I saw this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The only actors I'd heard of were Amanda Seifrid,  Anne Hathaway, and the man and woman who play the Thenardiers. So, I didn't judge anyone based on singing, like so many people have. I thought everyone did a great job on this film.<br />I noticed several omisions and additions to this movie, some good, some horribly wrong. Here are a few;<br />The prologue had a additional lyric sung by Javert, to explain the passport. Interesting to have it set on a ship on the sea, that's how I imagined it.<br />I dreamed a dream and Lovely ladies were reversed in the film, because in the French concept album, Lovely Ladies comes before I dreamed a dream. And, it makes sense for Fantine to sing about her life after she's fallen. In the book, she has a lover who abandons her, then she slowly falls in to prostitution. The stage and film make more out of that than the book. Anne's version of I dreamed a dream blows everyone else's out of the water, vut that's just me being biased.<br />Did anyone else notice a verse missing from Lovely Ladies, not the locket one, either. It's one with one of the women singing about herself, I think they cut that for time. Fantine sells her teeth to a dentist, and her hair to a barber over a period of months, which is described very well.<br />In Fantine's arrest, the man throws snow down her chest, like the book. That was shortened because the director felt we didn't need to hear more abuse after seeing it. Anne and Russell Crow do wonderfully here, Anne sounds so heartbroken. Javert is cold in the book, and Russell fits him perfectly. Hugh Jackman is great as Jean Valjean, wanting to help her.<br />Fantine's death was a tear-jerker, as always. In the book Javert appears to Fantine before she dies, but that was left out in favor of the play, where he comes after. I'm not sure why some of the lyrics were changed, except in the novel, she is promised she will see her child.<br />The confrontation was a surprise, because a fight was added. I'm not sure where the sword came from, but it was there. Somehow they manage to fight and sing at the same time. Valjean just grabbs a bar to fend off Javert when he comes to arrest him. He doesn't actually attack. I'm also not sure where the water came from for Valjean's escape.<br />Castle on a Cloud was shortened, not by much. The actress playing Cosette was good, very believable.<br />Madame Thenardier was played wonderfully, as was her husband I wasn't expecting Helena and Sasha to act together, but I was surprised with Master of the house. Those changes were horrible, Santa with a prostitute, really! Notcommic at all.<br />The meeting in the woods was in the novel, as was the bargain. Cosette was given a doll, too. When Cosette sees her, she's awe-struck, afraid lightning will strike if she touches her.<br />Suddenly was the only solo song, and it's beautiful! There is a chapter in the novel where Valjean is with Cosette, and they both start to experience love for the first time.<br />Yes, the chase did take place in the novel. There is a chapter devoted to the streets, and the convent itself, several chapters, in fact. Valjean really hoists Cosette over a wall in to the garden, using a rope.Look down is is amazing, with Gavroche comming out of the elephant. In the book, he lives there with other children. The slums and students are realistic, too. Marius's grandfather has a bigger part in the novel, where he throws Marius out after he sides with his father, after Marius learns about him.<br />Eponine does live near Marius, and she does visit his room, seeking money and letters her father writes to the poor. In this version, she knows about his grandfather.<br />This version combined events for thesong with Javert talking to the Thenardiers. In the novel, Marius goes to Javert, who tells him what to do. Marius witnesses Cosette and her father entering their room, and he doesn't know her name. Valjean is taken prisoner when he returns with money, then Javert arrests him, and the rest. His family are arrested, too.<br />Amanda makes a great Cosette, and the man playing Marius is good, too. They both have good singing voices for their love scenes. Poor Eponine is wounded, you can tell. The garden scenes take place before LaMarque's funeral, so they rearranged those songs. No one burst in to song during the funeral, instead, everyone was terrified, not to sure what to expect.<br />I wasn't sure how they were going to do One Day More, but it turned just like the play, the only difference being the visuals. Many things were shown, including building a barricade, and Cosette going to another house.<br />Eponine dresses like a boy, and takes a letter from Cosette, doesn't give it to Marius until her death. Instead, Gavroche delivers a letter to Valjean. that's why the lines \\"Took the letter like you said, met her father at the door, said he would give it, don't think I can stand anymore\\" are omited.<br />I felt the battle was like Rambow, with all the guns and deaths. Gaveroche's death was sad, just like Eponine's.<br />I'm annoyed that Turning was shortened, makes Marius the only one who cares. Empty Chairs was beautiful.<br />When Marius returns home, his grandfather receives him warmly, he really missed him, and wanted him to return. Valjean confesses to Marius his crimes, he is surprised, but agrees not to tell Cosette.<br />The final scenes with the Thenardiers are comical, with them stealing everything they see. In the book, Marius is shown a scrap of cloth, and recognizes it as his.<br />Valjean's death was a tear-jerker, too. Seeing all the people who died on the barricade was wonderful because they were in heaven.<br />I'm sure I missed a few key points, butthose were the changes I noticed.
0920668372|5.0|Me and my son love this book.  He even repeats some of the story to me now since we have read it so much.  He loves it when I say how the mommy rocks her little boy, \\"back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\\"  He also repeats the recurring song, \\"I'll love your forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\"  I literally cried the first time I read this to him!  It is such a sweet little book.

B008Y79IUE|4.0|Although coated in a patina of melodrama, this story of the unwinding of dreams and potential is difficult to watch but satisfying. The performances deserve the praise they got in the popular media and this early work from Jennifer Connelly may actually have been her best. The directing and music clearly increase the tension as you watch addiction destroy the lives of the four main characters. Some might see the directing as a bit gratuitous, I think it was well synchronized to the rhythm of music and the film. One of the strengths of this film is the overt grittiness...remember, this film was originally released NC-17 and you can see why. The story will likely haunt you for a few days after you watch it because you know - despite the melodrama - that characters like this are spiraling down their lives in the real world right now...right in this moment.

I carry a lot of baby weight and I barely keep my house in order (probably like a lot of other moms) .  I don't have a ton of time to exercise.<br /><br />If I can do it, anyone can do it.  Jillian keeps it interesting and I like her style.  I've only done the level 1 workout so far and it really kicked my butt.  You are definitely making the most of your time.  If you can fit in 20 minutes to exercise,  Jillian will make those 20 minutes count.

B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased this trology for my Kindle after reading the actual books.  I love this story and devoured these books in just days.  Now I enjoy the availability of just picking up my kindle to read these at any time without hauling 3 books around.
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|If you read and liked the book, you will no doubt enjoy this movie.  I enjoyed how well the movie adapted the book and made the most of the characters to bring a complex work together.<br /><br />If you have never read the book, you will be confused.<br /><br />Since there are multiple stories, separated by time, the movie jumps around a lot.  I can't see how anyone could make sense of it if they weren't acquainted with characters and story.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Wife is a big fan of &#34;Friends&#34; so purchased this as a gift for her. If you love the series this is a must have.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This movie is a wonderful, true-to-life story with all the annoyances, laughter, and love that life often provides. It is especially refreshing to see a story line that lifts the curtain on the mother/son relationship to reveal both its purity and imperfection without degrading it into yet another modern cynical or dysfunctional punch line. Bravo to the screen writer and the wonderful actors who brought the story to life!
B000025706|5.0|To date, this remains the most important \\"complete\\" set of the Mozart concertos, although not without the requisite cautions and reservations due to some controversial, but valid, interpretive choices made by the performers.  That being said, however, everything about this set bespeaks a deep understanding of the Mozart idiom, a great deal of thought and intelligence, and, most importantly, risk taking.<br /><br />The first risk - Schiff's decision to partner with Vegh - may not seem like one at all, but his sacrificing of some interpretive control to his colleague allows Schiff to completely surrender his focus to matters of interpretation.  And in that sense, the risks pay off.  Vegh is no mean accompanists but a brilliant Mozartian in his own right, and under his leadership, the Camerata Salzburg delivers performances with few equals.  What Vegh and company achieve is strikingly idiomatic, all the more so because it is exactly what Mozart (likely) had in mind.  There are too many examples of fabulous ensemble work to site individually, but there are some highlights: the dazzling string work in the second movement in K 453 or the magnificent horn work in the entirety of K 482.  The winds especially are just spectacular throughout the entire series, from their brusque humor in the outer movements of K 459 or the absolutely stunning bassoon work in the development of K467's allegro.  Of course, much of the praise must go to Vegh, who elicits just magnificent work from the ensemble.  What is most striking about Vegh's contribution, however, is his ability to drive the music forward.  A perfect example is his shaping of the developments in K 456 and the mighty 503.  Both works featuring episodic and somewhat repetitive developments as the orchestra and piano toss about the thematic materials.  In Vegh's hands, however, the music drives forwards and never outstays its welcome.  Particularly in 503, the secondary march-theme never sounds tedious due to Vegh's shaping of the music coupled with exceptional sense of pacing and flow.  It is, simply put, top notch Mozart.<br /><br />Of course, as the man at the center of it all, Mozart has rarely had such an earnest and intelligent advocate.  The playing throughout is perfection, something we come to expect from any pianist who tackles these monuments of the keyboard repertoire, but what is really special is Schiff's musicality.  He shapes paragraphs of sound brilliantly - the beautiful mood painting he and the orchestra conjure at the beginning of K451, the chase beauty of K 467's famous slow movement, or the sustained delicacy K 414's andante.<br /><br />Schiff's intelligence also is on full display in his perfectly-created cadenzas.  His \\"pumped up\\" version of Casadesus's perfect cadenza for K482's first movement is well-choses while his own creation for the finale seamlessly marries the music from the central interlude with the jubilant main themes.  Similarly, Schiff's bombastic cadenza for the allegro of 503 can be forgiven as it brings an appropriate sense of occasion to Mozart's most Apolloian concerto.<br /><br />What is most striking about the Schiff-Vegh partnership, however, is the energy and brio that so-often gets lost in Mozart.  Indeed, gone is that sense of \\"Dresden China,\\" that dainty preciousness that we so often find in Mozart concertos.  The vim and vigor applied to K 459 highlights Mozart's humor while the explosive openings of K 482 and 503 are unapologetically grand.  The risks the team take in underscoring the many moods of Mozart - the pompous and arrogant (K 179, 271, 503), the touching (K 414, 459, 488), the joyous (K 453, 482), the bravery (K 466, 491) - gives further proof that these works are the last word in both technical and emotional intellectualism.<br /><br />With so much individual thought brought to each project, however, there are choices that may seem controversial to some.  The expansiveness of K 459's outer movements undercut Mozart's intent in showcasing technical skill.  The paired-down versions of the three early Viennese concertos (i.e., no winds in 414, no trumpets or drums in 415) tend towards chamber music.  Most interestingly is the texturally sparse K 595, where Schiff and Vegh create a chillingly icy air for Mozart's swan song.  While it is likely Mozart would have written additional piano concertos had he lived longer, Schiff's conception of the work as a final farewell is certainly valid, especially as it is so exceptionally well argued.  Finally, there are times where Vegh and Schiff do not seem entirely on the same page, such as in K 271, where Vegh's forward drive does not mesh with Schiff's sentimental musings from the keyboard.<br /><br />There are many sets of these concertos that are fabulous, including Perahia and Uchida, both of whom are more \\"consistent\\" in the sense that their canonizing interpretations are less idiomatic.  And then there are those fantastic individual performances from Curzon and Casadesus which are required for any respectable Mozart collection.  But on the whole, Schiff and Vegh beat the lot with their intelligent, risky, gutsy, colorful, and, most importantly, idiomatic set.  Recommended for all who care about this music.n showcasing technical skill.

B005PK56TA|3.0|I love Connie Britton, which helped. I'm not usually into horror or scary stuff, but got hooked on this after an episode or two
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Always excellent writing and acting. It's a consistently good series. Having missed the early shows, it was fun to watch them in a few sittings.  I really love video on amazon prime!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling is a collection of classic fables written to provide moral lessons. Each chapter is a different tale and is preceded or followed with a poem or song to deliver the moral. The book includes three stories featuring Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera that are the basis of the Disney movie. The book also features Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a story likely familiar to many readers. The book also includes 11 additional short stories that are mostly entertaining and worth the time to read. As a whole, the book should appeal to the young reader as well as to older readers that desire a trip down memory lane. The book was free to read on my Kindle but I would likely pay several dollars to read it. I strongly recommend this book.
B007XELMO4|4.0|So it's not exactly unnoticeable - carrying a full frame digital Leica M9 on your shoulder, but it is far more comfortable and convenient than any system I've had before - granted all I've tried previously are neck straps.  I carried it while hiking and climbing in the Scottish Highlands, sometimes hiking 8 miles + per day, and climbed a couple 3,000 plus foot peaks with it.  The only thing I needed was a water proof cover, as it almost always raining there and you can't pull your rain coat over you pack straps.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I Love this!! It is so much fun and I love games. I can hardly put it down. I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was good.The best part were the games. I would recommend this book to someone who likes fighting and complex plots.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|one of the greatest Errol Flynn movie of all time he really makes you believe that he is Robin Hood
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Anyone who loves fantasy should give this a try...you have to read past the first couple of chapters to really get into it....and you must read this before you watch it. It's not as fun to read if you watch it first.
B002AWX6UM|3.0|I've read a lot of book in my day. This is one is an 'okay' read. The story is touching, but it is what I would expect of a translated copy. The introduction is enjoyable, but by the time you get 25% in, the story feels like its just dragging on.<br /><br />*Begin Spoiler Alert*<br />It just seems like the boys move from one village to the next, seeing more and more death.<br />*End Spolier Alert*
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I was absolutely in love and obsessed win this game, however when I got further in, I couldn't open the app and after many longs of waiting, I opened it again only to learn I had to start all over again. but overall, its a nice game to kill time
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The characters will stay with me for awhile.  I enjoyed the story even though I predicted the ending.  It was fun getting there.  I would defiantly read other things by Ms. McKenna.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I dig the 9 buttons and the adjustable weight for the mouse. Wish all the lights were customizable not just the center anchor icon where you cover it with the palm of your hand. As well as I wish the extra buttons were also programmable as mice buttons in of themselves (like mouse button 4, 5 etc:) instead of just shortcuts to keyboard single key or multi-keystrokes.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Ok movie. Would not have paid $15 movie price to see. Stared out with to much vulgar language for my taste.
B008602KQI|5.0|Held off watching it for awhile, glad that I did eventually. Was a really good story and entertaining. Hope the sequel is as good!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a fan of this series from the beginning, not because of the good writing style (it's mediocre at best), or because any of the books rate as great literature, but because the series was a fun escape and easy read at the end of a long day. Each book has been a complete story in itself and Ms. Harris has always done well to fill in just enough information that someone picking up nearly any of the books in the series could follow what was happening. The characters were fun, the stories painted a fully developed world in plain view yet never noticed and let's face it the tid bits of sensual scenes with attractive, dangerous male charaters were always a bonus for this mom of two.<br />I was sad to hear that this book would be the last in the series, so it was with anticipation that I began this final read. My dissapointment was multiplied by the lackluster send off this series seems to have received from it's author. This final book is definately anticlimatic in it's action and a half hearted attempt at a story at best, it really feels like Ms. Harris ran out of gas on this one. Maybe the author was over Sookie and her counterparts and was just dialing it in? Maybe the bottom had been scrapped awhile ago for story ideas in this series and this was the dead bits floating to the top, scooped up and called a finale? Whatever the case I was greatly dissapointed by this final chapter in the Sookie Stackhouse series, it definately did no justice to a world or characters that were creative and enjoyable and thankfully not sparkly. I hope to start another of Ms. Harris' series soon and hope to find her back on top of her game.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|great film this is to replace the one we had and now no one can finds watched it last night
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An excellent book. Compelling. It keeps you interested in the people right to the end. It also gives you a perspective into the honor and duty of most of the professional pilots of the the German Air Force. All in all, an excellent read.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this is such a great game and I love it. It is fun to play and very entertaining. Every one should get this game!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I love this game! The graphics and spaciousness of the map are fantastic. The only issue I have with it is that it will freeze (this isn't a one-time thing, it happens to me 2-3 times per day) and will sometimes stay frozen for hours. When you try to exit out it will lose all your progress...I spent about a week playing it and I was kn tiger shark and then I lost all my progress and now I'm back to the reef shark again. Besides that, though, it's a good and well-thought through app.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Of course its not movie quality special effects but the acting is good and it seems it has a lot of room for then story to grow. Not bad at all
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|liked it a lot.  great acting especially by Jude Law. Many twists and turns. Kept me interested and intrigued.  I give it 4 stars.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|King did a fascinating job mixing fact with fiction. Descriptions of the 60's make you feel as if you are there. You can almost smell, taste and feel the things Jake  is describing.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I was not fully aware of John Reed's accomplishments during this turbulent time in history.  One must remember that he was not advocating communism as we remember it from the Cold War Era.  But communism as an ideology that liberated the downtrodden (ie - serfs, factory workers) from the omnipotent Czars and rich industrialists.  He was one of the early avant garde who dared to speak against the  establishment, a basic right we all cherish.  No wonder Mr. Reed is buried in the Kremlin Wall.<br />All aspects of the movie were great.  Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton were superb.  The infusion of eyewitness accounts added to it's realism.  Must give Beatty a lot of credit for tackling such a controversial historical figure and the dreaded (depending on your perspective) topic of communism.<br />This movie is not for everyone.  But if you are a student of history and of course film, I think you'll really enjoy this movie.  Two thumbs up!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I enjoy watching a zombie movie even it is animation. I hope there will be a second season for this show.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best series on TV this year!!!  Great scenery, photography, acting, costumes, etc.  Addictive in the best way!!!  Can't wait for Season 4.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I genuinely enjoyed reading this book. The historical aspects mixed with fictional scripts made this a fascinating read. I would recommend this for everyone.
B009NY43NY|5.0|**Spoiler alert**<br /><br />I have enjoyed the series, and I think this is a good end to it.  She never could have ended up with Eric as her happy ever after, because she could not be happy as a vamp.  Ever.  She and Sam have always been drawn to each other, and I have thought for some time they would end up together.  I like how she did not smash them together at the end into a big committed relationship.  She left us with the possibility/probability that Sookie & Sam would end up together.<br /><br />I mostly enjoyed how Sookie has progressed throughout the series beginning as the town freak with very few friends to having a number of supporters & protectors.  She is a strong & independent character and she ended the series that way as well.<br /><br />I know there were some inconsistencies, but all of the books have inconsistencies, and I am a casual fan who doesn't read each book a hundred times so they don't ruin my enjoyment of the books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very fun and you can do what real horse trainers and care takers do it allows you to care for the horse as if it were real

B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Wow! Who saw this coming? The last album was a step in the right direction but this is a world beyond that. If you like melodic death then this is for you. (and it is really long!)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever for<br />all devices also it has events for world tours like holidays<br />Boring when dieing because u got to start over
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Its a new singer for Kamelot but the band doesn't miss a beat.This album is better than their last, but not quite as good as their classic albums, The Black Halo and Ghost Opera.
0345525558|5.0|An intriguing expression of the foster child system from the child's perspective into adulthood.  Story is spoken in the long-forgotten language of flowers.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|The Melodic Death Metal Band that Always Delivers, thats what DT is. This album has them shifting gears to a more mature melodic sound and experimenting with new song structures. Its pretty much all a success.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My son loves this game. I originally got it for me but he took it over...definitely recommend it for road trips...
1616550414|5.0|the book is beautiful and has a lot of interesting concept art for the many games as well as an amazing comic at the end
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Before seeing this movie I was skeptical if I would like it. The concept of a boy and a tiger sharing a life boat seemed far fetched. However, after buying the blu ray 3D version of the movie, I watched it a couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. I loved everything about it. The human story and characters were wonderful, the special effects amazing, yet not noticeable and not distracting from the story. It was magical and wonderful. I was transported to Pi's world and went along withe the ride until the end.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is the best game ever. It may take up alot of space but it is worth it. PLAY I T RIGHT NOW!
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Spock provided a few laughs, eye candy gets annoying, plot? oh yeah, robots. Loved the line about Decepticons getting all the good stuff.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was definitely the best book that I've read in a long time. It was so well written, and it took until the end to really know what decision was going to be made. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Agree with previous reviewer (\\"1\\") regarding CONS... start screen & turn off voice announcing category. Couldn't get the voice to be totally eliminated.
B00COMQZ7O|3.0|I enjoy my time at the piano and have many books that I use. One is from the movie, &#34;Thoroughly Modern Millie&#34; with all the songs. This is just the sheet music for one song which was a disappointment. But I will keep it, and one day may be glad I bought it.
B00846WWVM|4.0|fun and challenging at times. Can see where it could become addicting if you let it.<br />works fine on my LG motion
B00124PXW8|4.0|It is a good, classic film! Worth seeing if you never have for the classic nature on its own. Pretty great effects for the time it was created!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Functions perfectly on my Samsung note pro, kindle fire hd and the phone Galaxy S4
B0053O89WY|4.0|I love The Big Bang Theory and in season four I felt the addition of the female characters brought this show to a much higher level. In this season, as great as it is. I do not feel it is better or worse. At this point we are still stuck at the level season four left us at. Just showing our four favorite nerds learning to live life and still hold the sanctity of their nerdome. What I do like about this season is the story lines of Sheldon and Raj as we watch Sheldon slowly start to realize there is someone in his life who actually has feelings for him and Raj who is still trying to find that special someone. It all ends of course with an event that was three years in the making and now we move on to season six and see what will unfold in all of its nerdy glory.

B00AFEY354|5.0|'The Perks of Being A Wallflower' is the best film I saw in 2012 and one of the greatest I have ever seen. This film fills you with so many emotions with a cast that is probably one of the most relateable in a film. Even though there are a few extremes that comes with each character, their nature and their bonds of friendship are some of the most incredible. As the story unfolds there are parts that can make you laugh and cry and sometimes conjure up memories of your time in school with your friends because chances are something in this film may have happened to you. Emma Watson has to be spoken about just because it is her first major role since Harry Potter and she did an incredible job even though at some points her inner British came out. Logan Lehrman is amazing and of course Ezra Miller steals the show. Why he got no nomination at the Oscars is beyond me. While I have never read this novel I am sure most can say how well in compares to the book, epseically since the author himself wrote the script and directed the film.<br /><br />I love this movie and I encourage everyone to see it, even if you don't like movies like these it is guaranteed to strike a chord with you.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Compared to the usual extremely positive review this album gets, my review is quite negative. In reality, though, I see my view of this album is being pretty fair. I don't say it's a \\"bad\\" album simply because I'm annoyed at the praise it receives. That wouldn't wouldn't be the truth, because it's certainly not bad. But is it good? At times, but it doesn't approach greatness and it certainly doesn't approach being the greatest record of all-time.<br /><br />If I wasn't aware of the tremendous praise this album receives, I'd literally never be able to guess it. For something so universally-acclaimed, the listening experience is thoroughly ordinary. Forget the complaints that Thom Yorke sounds \\"whiny\\", or that it's \\"too depressing\\". My criticisms are not as superficial as that, and such complaints really should be ignored. My main problem is that there is a lack of substance to this record. Basically, this is slightly more intelligent pop music for people who have a bit more interest in music than your average listener. Comparisons to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" are fairly well-justified in that both records are not particularly interesting from a creative standpoint, but have the kind of blend of musical competence and style that makes them extremely popular with the mainstream music press (and therefore with their readers).<br /><br />After all, both are exceedingly accessible records. Unless you're seriously unaccustomed to any type of music that isn't played on the blandest of radio stations, it can't be said that OK Computer ever delves into any sort of challenging territory. While that's not a requirement for a record, I do think it's a requirement if the record is to be taken seriously as a true work of art, a masterpiece, and one of the \\"greatest ever\\". There are records from the 60s (hell, even the 50s, if we count jazz) that are likely to surprise you more than this album ever could. And if your mind is open, those are the type of surprises that winyou over and reward you the most in the end, I think. Listen to Pere Ubu's \\"The Modern Dance\\" from 1978 and ask yourself, which album surprised you more often? It may surprise you so much that you hate it, or you may only hate it at first. But the beauty is that you may come around to appreciate its willingness to shock you for the sake of a purer form of expression.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, OK Computer is by no means a bad record. It's a totally competent, easily-accessible pop album that is sort of a victim of its own incredible success. I don't \\"hate\\" it, and I don't complain that the singer sounds whiny, or that the lyrics are \\"depressing\\", or anything like that. I just don't think it's done anything to deserve its status, and at least at the time, it doesn't sound like Thom Yorke did either: \\"We write pop songs ... there was no intention of it being 'art'.\\"
B005LAIIJY|4.0|After 'Inglorious Bastards', the golden God of the wacky returns with Django Unchained. Once again he gives us everything we could ask for in a film that bears his name. Something out there, an incredible cast with the usual stand offish role that we have never seen before from at least one A lister and of course a movie that just makes you grin knowing you just saw pure awesomeness.<br /><br />'Django Unchained' does have some similarities from its predecessor, but there is no challenge to look beyond that and just enjoy this hysterical and intense romp. I did however feel that at some point there was a lull and wonder why a whole part of the story was there because I felt that the film could have ended and that it was not needed. Then all I had to do was wait until the end and just enjoy and I was left satisfied. This movie like all of Tarentino's work is great. Fun and completely out of control. Perhaps maybe for Robert Rodriguez and Edgar Wright there is not a single director out there quite like this guy. It was nice to also see him get some credit for his work by receiving the Oscar for best original screen play, as it was deserved.<br /><br />This is a fun movie and I am sure there are people out there that like it more than me, but when it comes to this film as well as the whole Tarentino library, 'Django Unchained' is an awesome addition to the collection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you ever enjoyed the Myst games, this is the game for you. It's a little short, but we'll worth the two bucks.
B009AMANBA|4.0|These days the average movie goes wants the instant gratification of a theater going experience. Our screens are filled with insane special effects, outrageous in your face dialogue of all sorts and more attractive eye candy than any human can handle. Rarely today someone comes along and decides I need to take a step back to a time when movies were just a little more meaningful. Great acting and an extremely movie story that may not take 90 minutes to complete.<br /><br /> Steven Spielberg gives us an incredible film in his latest 'Lincoln' This was a movie that has been talked about for years and after many changes all across the spectrum it finally comes to the theaters. What it is may not be the most exciting film, but it is a true piece of natural history. The movie does not just give us the points this historic figures life we know about. It dives deep inside to discover the fact that even a president can just be an average man. Not a perfect man by any means, but a good man. This movie is lengthy and gives you a true sense of power and meaning. The cast chosen could not be better. Daniel Day Lewis gave an incredible performance that won him another Oscar, which was worthy. Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and even James Spader gave great presence in their roles. The events that unfold are gripping even though it all takes place in political halls. The ending of course leaves you breathless and at the same time a true feeling of patriotism.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the pace and style that is not what the average movie goer these days is use to, this film may not live up to most of your expectations. However, if you are an appreciator of classic film work and are willing to look past the instant gratification of the current movie, then 'Lincoln' will be a true triumph in your eyes.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|The Martha Stewart Circle Edge Paper Punch, although pricey, is easy to use and produces wonderful doily shapes from 5.5&#34; to 11.5.&#34;  Sure, you can buy doilies at a store, but with this device, you can make them in any color and for the size you need.  Many uses for doilies are shown on the Martha Stewart web site, from stringing them as garlands to cutting them in fourths to use as cup cake holders.<br />The first purchase is for the system.  After that, one buys &#34;cartridges&#34; to provide additional designs for doilies.
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|I may not be the biggest fan of live albums, but when Iced Earth makes one all bets are off. 'Alive In Athens' is one of the greatest Iced Earth albums to date, the energy of the crowd the songs belted out by Matt Barlow and everything else just oozes with grandeur.<br /><br />Then when you look at 'Live in Ancient Kourion', not only do you get another great live album, but you get something completely different from the first. Of course since the release of 'Alive In Athens' Iced Earth has been in the studios recording 6 new albulms and of course we have heard many vocal changes. Stu Block brings a whole different kind of energy to the classic songs and he gets into it in the album. Asking for more crowd participation and some of his lines are just amazing. I would have liked to have had more songs from 'Glorious Burden' and 'Something Wicked Pt. 2' Still, what I got in this album is another phenomenal Iced Earth album.<br /><br />As of now Iced Earth is one of the few bands in which I have 10 or more albums from. They are just an incredible experience to listen to. The lyrics and musician ship and everything in between is like nothing you will ever hear. Even if you don't like Heavy Metal, this is a band that will change your perception on the genre.
B001JIFYSA|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember one or more protagonists that fall in love over nothing of substance, a jerk whose love for someone necessitated, in his mind, inconveniencing strangers at an airport, and a diatribe about the Iraq war from a British prime minister.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was using another app and started having problems so download the Yahoo Mail and it works really great!  Love my Kindle Fire.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book - with twists and turns and a surprising look relationships from a man's and woman's perspective - but in a fantastic mystery told through alternating diary entries.<br /><br />Read it - you'll love it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good graphics and very entertaining.  I didn't want to put it down.  I want to get the sequel for sure .
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I first watched this back when it aired in 2008. It's not so much flash and guns as it is an interesting look into what it is to be human. The dichotomy between how humans and robots view a situation is always fascinating, I love how Cameron views emotion as an effective tool. The best stories are not about the terminators designed soley to kill but have specific missions and seeing how they go about doing them. Also it has guns, violence and attractive ladies as the icing on this philosophical cake.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The life of PI is a 3d movie that I don't mind watching several times over. The 3d really adds that special something to this movie that it is worth the extra investment.. enjoy
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not mindless coin collecting or shooting.  This requires though, focus, and some creative thinking.  Can not wait for the next room.
B008518MOW|4.0|MIB is a great series. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this in 3d. There are several titles out there that I feel use the 3d with better effect, but it is still worth the investment. If you are on the fence,  I'd recommend that you buy this one, you wont be disappointed.
B005HSL626|5.0|I had never played this game before because I couldn't afford to buy the apps necessary.  Thank you for allowing me to play for free!  I am now addicted and may need to seek professional help in dealing with chopping fruit.:)
B0090SI42Y|4.0|Beings a child of the 80's my grandfather gave me boat loads of martial art/ ninja movies and I loved them.  This movie takes me back there and have fun watching the ridiculous action.
B000I0GGSW|5.0|Douglas & Garcia are both phenomenal in this movie...probably some of my favorite work from Garcia.<br />This movie still stands up well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This addition is slower and not as straightforward, than older version.  It does give you everything you need for local weather.  I would rather see the critical information captured on one page.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|It worked for me.  Since I live in Hawaii its good to get a good product and good choice.  So thanks.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I love movies based on true stories and this one was no exception.  It took you right back in to the day and time of prohibition. Very well acted.
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|It's an excellent concert overall.  Video is high quality, sound is high quality with a very strange caveat:  It is only Dolby 2.0 stereo.  This is not a mistype - hard to believe a modern recording not being 5.1 Dolby or DTS!!!!<br /><br />Still, the sound is very good, but on my system, it sounds better to turn off my Dolby Pro Logic and play it conventional stereo w/o any attempt by the receiver to play w/ making it something it isn't.<br /><br />The band is outstanding and I highly recommend this one, just like all the other Ringo All Starr concerts.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Started out exciting but after awhile the sexiness and thrill became annoying to read and needed a change of scene besides sex!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was much better than I expected. I will be watching the next one. If you are looking for a good movie you can't go wrong here.
0312383347|5.0|great book series, very fun read, exciting and funny all at the same time. would recommend reading the whole series and four between the numbers books.
B004GK2B6Q|5.0|This was a great family movie-perilous at times but graphics were fantastic.  Kids really enjoyed it.(6 and 8 yr olds)

0393316041|5.0|The late and great Richard Feynman meticulously and beautifully takes us on a journey of his wild, adventurous and intellectually gifted life in this collection of his adventures. This genius and Nobel Laureate was one of the great minds of the 20th century and demonstrates in this collection of his personal experiences why it is not necessarily WHAT you think but HOW you think that makes a great mind. If there is any reading that I would highly recommend to others, it would be this funny witted collection for precisely the aforementioned reason. A wonderful read and HIGHLY recommended.
0375842209|5.0|My wife really like it. Read it for a book club. Everyone enjoyed it. I may even have to start reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|everyone should have this game on their device. it is great for children terns even young adults. my best friend has this game and she has gone past the basics she has taken it to a whole new level. we even have compotitions to see who can make the better minecraft tower. you should get this its worth every penny and then some. :)
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|For Simon Collins fourth album he enlists some help and forms a new band.  A concept album which for most defines progressive rock along with multiple time changes, etc., etc.  It's hard to imagine how Collins has matured since his first album of basically electronica pop to this fantastic album of progressive rock.  Hints of this were seen on his album from 2008 entitled 'U-Catastrophe' which was a killer five star album.  So, how do you beat that?  Not sure if he beats it, but he just adds some new elements and produces a killer five star album that most of the mainstream music industry will totally ignore.  While you can pick up Phil Collins here and in previous efforts as far as the striking resemblance on how much he sounds like his father, Simon definitely keeps it fresh and totally in his own.  The track 'Beyond Illumination' even has hints of Peter Gabriel.  Fantastic.  And the ending track clocks in at over 19 minutes which, again, is usually a mainstay of \\"Prog\\".  If you're new to Collins then you will not be disappointed in this at all.  I've waited five years for his new release and it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />All of Who You Are 1999<br />Time For Truth 2005<br />U-Catastrophe 2008
B00AAX68HG|4.0|this is a really fun,but challenging game. can't wait to show it to my grandkids. the ads are a bit annoying, but we can handle it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.I can play this game for hours at a time,without even realizing that  I,ve been at it for so long..Great game

B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a good game. it has kept my nine year old daughter accupied for a long time. its not too challenging of a game. ive played some that were too difficult. but this one is fun.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|6-01-2013<br />THIS IS AN EXCELLENT HORROR MOVIE  AND  REMAINS  MY FAVORITE.OF ALL THE RECENT MOVIES I HAVE GOTTEN.<br />MR. TULLO
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|John just keeps getting better and better.  His friends aren't too bad either.  I hope he does more projects like this.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is great. Entertaining, great graphics. But it take so long for the fish to make a pearl. Then after that amount of time I come back to the game and the fish still isn't ready. The coral and plants each have a certain amount of time before they can be harvested also, but that time is very quick compared to the fish. I don't like feeling forced to purchase extras just to continue a game at a reasonable pace. It makes me less likely to play it and just find a similar game to play.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|Found it easy to read even though its a classic. Saw a movie on TV based on this book and that's why I chose to read it. It was interesting making comparisons as I read.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Good, quick story of a view of the inside life of teenagers dealing with cancer. Recommend if you are looking for something easy and don't mind a few tears.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I like it, but I can't use it much. I have satellite internet. It sucks up all of my download time to use it.
B00BXVKKPA|4.0|Maybe the album needs to really sink into me more but I feel like I'm hearing a lot of retreads of older songs and hooks and nothing really \\"new.\\" Airbourne is great and they rock yes, but this album was just good to me. I may have even liked No Guts No glory better. Runnin' Wild is still number one of all their albums, had the best hooks, riffs, vocals, and songs. This record you can tell O'Keefe is losing his voice a little which sucks and he has to tone it down for some songs. Hopefully he rests his throat more and takes care of his voice because this is some of the best rock we old school fans will probably get for awhile. I gave Runnin' Wild a 5, and NGNG a 4.25 so this gets a 4 mainly on the guitar work.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I have read many books about the Second World War and this book did not live up to my expectations. It had been recommended by a friend and was a choice by my Book Club. I suppose as a &#34;young adult&#34; book there is a need to constantly break from the story to give an explanation of the previous section but the frequency of this was disrupting for me.<br />Life for the main character was certainly a challenge but the story did not hold my interest and the ending although more interesting was somewhat of a disappointment.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|great story but i wish i could read the original swedish version, i always feel as though the genius of larsson's writing is lost in the translation.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Didn't think that I would enjoy this series because of the whole premise. But jumped right on second book as I really love the author's style and she drew me in immediately on The Hunger Games.  You fall in love with the characters and your hooked. Not just a kids book.
B004J64QSI|5.0|There is no wonder why this play has been enjoyed by so many for so long. I will watch it over and over.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|It's ok, there are a lot of other games that I find more interesting.  This can get boring really fast.  Just not for me.  I like to have games on my cell phone to keep the grandkids busy if we are stuck somewhere and they are getting bored.  This isn't for them.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The attention to detail & the interpersonal relationships of the characters are very well done. The only thing missing are the smells to completely immerse you in that beautiful place.
B000J2BRQU|4.0|This is a good time, hot car, hot chix, movie. It's not high art, just great fun. I recommend it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved it very glad that I read it.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book. It keep me guessing with very page.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|This is a classic story and very original for its time. As usual, the book was better but both the book and film are very short.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Perfect game i love it i have no problems with it what so ever rate 5.i think people should download this app. It is fun and addicting
0061950726|5.0|There but for the grace of God go I, is what everyone in the early part of this nation should pray.  This book should be part of American history 101

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this hidden object game is well designed so far. I will probably end up purchasing the unlocked version. It is much more challenging than just the average hidden object game.
B007RJJVSO|5.0|All the reviews before mine have discussed how experimental, 'artsy', proggy, etc. this record is. There are more than enough opportunities on YouTube and Spotify to give it a listen yourself. It took me a little while for this record to grow on me, but now I really enjoy it. Anyway, on to the vinyl edition of this... as with every other Steven Wilson and Opeth vinyl release, it's spectacular. Heavy-duty gatefold and heavy-duty LPs that play spectacularly. The art on teh cover is really cool and textured differently than most LPs, but in a better way. The inside of the gatefold just has information about the record and a picture of Mike and Steven. I wish they would have put more art into it instead of the pictures, but oh well. I'm buying this for the music. The inserts are the same. Pictures of the two, lyrics, that's it. Cool inserts, but I always love extra artwork.<br /><br />Bottom line is that if you enjoy this record, the best presentation of it is on vinyl. Well, I haven't heard the 5.1 DVD, but these LPs sound absolutely fantastic.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|Not user friendly and does not allow access to my songs on Amazon Cloud.<br />Not sure why Amazon removed the previous version of MP 3 player
034580404X|5.0|I really didn't know much about these books when I downloaded them.  Only that they were all the rage and I was curious. I was a bit disturbed when the BDSM part entered and wasn't certain I would continue reading, however my intrigue got the best of me.  I was enjoying the flirty relationship as it developed into a complete love story.  This love story is about unconditional love and accepting people with all their baggage and flaws and how that relationship develops - the good, bad and everything in between.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book was written so that the story, while sad and emotional, was very poignant and warming. The use of the local language was enough to give it the best Irish tone without completely confusing a non-Irish reader. The parts about trying out dating via the local newspaper were hilarious. It was a great little story.
B00008J2PG|5.0|IT IS AN OLD MOVIE, BUT IT HAS A LOT TO SAY AND THE ACTING IS GREAT. WELL WORTH VIEWING.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I liked that this was written from the man's point of view.  Funny moments and not a bad read for vanilla erotica.  Enjoyed the book and will recommend.
B006T3RM08|3.0|I'll reserve final word for after I upgrade the Mac Mini to Mountain Lion (still on Snow Leopard) and try out the new gestures.  But so far no issues.  The Apple keyboard and trackpad fit fine and the rim of the Henge Clique doesn't seem to be interfering with the trackpad at all.  And the whole set up lets me operate from the couch with the rig sitting on my lap which was the objective.  I still miss my DeNovo Edge Mac Ed., but I think that'll pass as I get more used to the new setup.<br /><br />Update 12/20/2013:<br />Haven't upgraded O/S, but have experienced the same touchpad fit issue reported by others here.  Michelle Parent's review is correct in my case too.  After scraping some plastic off the right side of the touchpad dock section I still had sticking issue.  After rereading her review I scraped both sides of the keyboard well and now the touchpad seems to be free of sticking.  I've downgraded my rating from four starts to three because I don't think a nearly $30 plastic tray should require DIY work to make it function satisfactorily.  If you choose to keep the product and do what I did, I do not recommend using power tools such as the Dremel.  Use a straight-bladed knife like a box cutter or Exacto and scrape the sides of the dock that touch the keyboard.  Scrape a little at a time and test the result as you go.  You probably won't have to scrape off much.

B009AMANBA|1.0|this is one of the most boring movies I have ever watched in my life. I mean the characters just sit down and talk to each other for 5/6 of the movie. Ridiculous!!! I will necver ever watch this movie again, no fighting, no action, just Lincoln sitting down and talking to his cabinet members and employees. hardly any black characters interact with the president in the movie. Pathetic.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a quick easy read.  He has a near death experience, and reflects on this experience logically, and is hard pressed to explain this spiritual event.  It changes how he lives and how he feels about his life and the present.  It's something we all wonder about and think about, even if we don't have any close calls.  The ending came quickly and abruptly leaving some questions unanswered.  I would recommend it to anyone who may be interested.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Best thing about this series is how well defined every character is,  They are real; believable.  Not stereotypical, but have the full range of human emotions and behaviors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I guess it's not fair for me to rate a Nicholas Sparks book because I love every one he's written.  I have a little trouble getting into them at first, but then BLAM I'm hooked.  I usually read while I'm walking on the treadmill for my 30 minutes.  Last week I got so into the book that I walked 1 hour and 40 minutes.  The treadmill shut off because I had reached the time limit.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger Than Fiction is now playing on cable.  I had heard nothing about this film, but the cast looked good so I watched it and was pleasantly surprised by my good fortune.  This film has many clever twists and turns as Will Ferrell tries to discover the identity of a voice that he hears while brushing his teeth or going through all the normal routines of his life.  And his life is routine.  He is a tax auditor for the IRS who lives by the book.  All that changes as he searches for people who can help him understand where the voice he hears is coming from.<br /><br />In an inspired bit of casting, Will goes to the office of Dustin Hoffman, a college professor who is an expert on literature.  Hoffman is obviously having a great time playing this role.  I was delighted with his \\"over the top\\" performance.  Hoffman's insights help Ferrell discover the famous author who is writing his story, Emma Thompson, also well cast in a role that allows her to showcase her many acting talents.<br /><br />Hoffman thinks her book is a masterpiece.  No spoilers here.  The reader of this review must decide whether the film is bought to a fitting conclusion.<br /><br />This movie is fanciful, creative, intelligent, well-acted, and just plain good fun often enough for me to be able to recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit off the beaten track.  That it is at times thought provoking is an added and unexpected bonus.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|What an killer live band!!!!  Forevermore alone is worth the price of admission. You feel like your in Japan along with the rest of the crowd. The bonus cd and dvd completes the pkg. I love Whitesnake  :-)
B000I3UMLQ|3.0|So Spock has a half-brother who looks like a pointy-eared Saddam Hussein, who manages to attract and then hijack a sad excuse for the Enterprise, all in an attempt to penetrate the Great Barrier (which has apparently moved from the edge of the galaxy to the exact center) and find the universal God.  That's pretty much the plot of this movie in a nutshell.  While Star Trek V: The Final Frontier does have its good moments, particularly in terms of the interplay between Kirk, Spock, and Bones, most Trekkies and movie-goers in general agree that this is without a doubt the worst of the six films featuring the original crew.  Even Gene Roddenberry was critical of various parts of this film.<br /><br />You could hardly ask for a more disappointing opening for a Star Trek film, as we watch a mysterious rider come upon a desert hole farmer (yeah, I said hole farmer) and release the man's pain.  That pointy-eared stranger is Sybok, the half-brother Spock has never bothered to mention.  One can only imagine the shame Sarek would feel (if Vulcans didn't bury their emotions) over this son, a renegade whose rejection of logic and embrace of emotions led to his expulsion from Vulcan.  If nothing else, we now know that Spock was by no means the black sheep of his family.  Following a vision of Shakaree, the legendary Vulcan \\"heaven,\\" Sybok puts together a small army on the Neutral Zone planet of Nimbus III and takes the tri-partite council of Klingon, Romulan, and Terran ambassadors hostage, all in an effort to bring a starship into orbit.  That starship is, of course, the new Enterprise, which has been dispatched by Starfleet despite the fact it has less than a skeleton crew - and almost nothing on the ship is actually working (despite Scotty's best efforts).<br /><br />Possible spoilers ahead as I talk about some of the problems with this movie.  First and foremost, Sybok's group of ragamuffin settlers is able to take control of the Enterprise with ridiculous ease.  Even some of Kirk's crew prove to be incredibly weak-willed in the face of Sybok's power.  If some weirdo came along and somehow freed me from my deepest and most personal pain, I would say Thanks, Dude but I would not devote myself to following this guru's every command.  I really expected more from the likes of Sulu and Uhura here (I can forgive Chekov, given his traumatizing experience at the hands of Khan).  And the Klingon ambassador, the once-illustrious master strategist Korrd - sure he's a drunken outcast now, but there's no way a fierce Klingon warrior like Korrd should go all sappy in the face of Sybok's mental manipulations.  Only Captain Kirk refuses any attempt by Sybok to brainwash him, delivering a classic \\"I need my pain\\" speech in the process.  I know some people were moved by the scene in which McCoy's deepest pain is identified and released, but I found it uncomfortable to watch and could only wonder why Kirk stood there and let it happen in the first place.  I also have to ask what the heck happened to that beautiful new Enterprise ship we saw at the end of Star Trek IV.  For one thing, the bridge has been completely redesigned, and I refuse to believe that any self-respecting crew of Starfleet technicians would have ever let this ship out of the dock given its almost infinite number of problems.  At the start of the film, the crew is on shore leave because they had to pull this dysfunctional ship back into dry dock for a vast retinue of repairs.  It also bothered me when Spock said he had no emotions, as that isn't strictly true - Vulcans choose to bury their emotions, but those feelings are still there far below the surface.<br /><br />Even though I pretty much worship the ground William Shatner walks on, you have to pin some of the blame for this film's problems on him, as he directed the film and co-wrote the story alongside David Loughery and Harve Bennett (who also appears in the film as the Starfleet Chief of Staff).  On the other hand, Shatner wasn'treally able to make the film he wanted to make - especially in terms of the ending, which is rather anticlimactic in its final form - because Paramount would not give him the money to make it all happen.  The production wasn't well-served by the special effects team, either.  With ILM wrapped up in other projects, the production team turned to another group that really wasn't up to this kind of major task.  It wasn't just the lack of money that prevented Shatner from giving the film the big ending he wanted - the special effects that were actually done for that ending were too crappy to even use.<br /><br />In retrospect, it seems that no one had full control over this movie.  Even as the director and co-writer, Shatner wasn't even able to prevent Sybok being portrayed as Spock's half-brother.  Still, despite all the negatives to this film, it's still well worth watching.  I'll take a three-star Star Trek film over many a four-star film any day, and there are a few really good scenes and quotable moments, such as the camping trip scenes with Kirk, Spock, and Bones and Spock's \\"not in front of the Klingons\\" quip.  Undeniably, though, this really is the one Star Trek film you can skip or choose not to revisit, as it disappointing in a number of ways and adds very little to the overall Star Trek story arc.really able to make the film he wanted to make - especially in terms of the ending, which is rather anticlimactic in its final form - because Paramount would not give him the money to make it all happen.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 8 year old loves this game. Recently I played and now I love this game. I wish there was a way to earn energy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've been playing this game for three years and never had a problem yet. Sure helps pass the time of day when the weather's bad.<br />Great game.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Enjoyed the insight into Aspergers disease, also recognised the symptoms in some people I have met. Definitely see this as an amusing movie in the future.
B004811PMO|5.0|Our family watches this at least 2 times a year as  classic songs are replayed in our minds over and over.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is an amazing headset with surround sound. It doesn't hurt your ears at all!<br />Great wireless range, even with walls in between. Clear and crisp sound.
B00BF11STU|3.0|ZERO DARK THIRTY is a very well-made film; cleverly photographed, well told, with a stunning central performance from Jessica Chastain as a CIA operative possessing both the determination and the sheer persistence to fulfill her quest to catch Osama Bin Laden.  The job is not always successful - along the way she loses colleagues and  friends, the victims of terrorist bombs and/or unexpected attacks.  Nor does she obtain full co-operation from her (mostly male) superiors, who seem more concerned with feathering their own reputational nests rather than accomplishing the job in hand.  However, I do have to admit that the film's structure - the us-versus-them notion, with numerous sequences showing the CIA operatives tracking their prey, as well as spying on one another - is a familiar one, dating from the Cold War films of the Sixties and early Seventies.  Only this time the enemies are not the Soviets, but those working for Al-Quaeda.  Other clich&eacute;s also prevail, including the passing of secrets in dark places, the use of extended long shots following characters walking along corridors, and the final sequence consisting of an extended raid on the Bin Laden lair.  Nonetheless the film is quite entertaining, if somewhat lengthy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There is always so much drama on this show. It is never boring!  Season 3 is the best season yet
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome! it is really fun. I would really suggest it. I love that game! super fun super fun game.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Just, well... tired. I'm loyal to Preston & Childs, but they have not done much to surprise me of late, and the pleasure of reading their most recent formulaic installments has faded to make the effort almost un-worthwhile. Thanks for another tale, guys.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|You won't find many books that incorporate the realism of Brooks with the imagination he put into describing how humans would survive a zombie pandemic.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Great story and enjoyed the humor sprinkled into the plot as it played out. I am looking forward to another chapter in the series.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I loved everything about this book.  As a 52 year-old, out-of-shape woman, it has been inspiring and helpful on my journey back into running.  While I struggle on a 30 minute run, my route taking me along a street Scott used to bike to work on, I imagine him coaxing me to keep going.  While I may never even run a marathon again, I know I can take my running to the next level by remembering that sometimes &#34;you just do things&#34;.
B004PZ4HC8|1.0|I had such big hopes for this book. I love zombie/horror anything, so my tolerance for bad fiction is pretty high when it comes this type of genre. The first chapter was tolerable with maybe one interview that was interesting. At first, I even didn't mind the question and answer style, but the large amount of time spent on military jargon was distracting and boring, along with the constant gratuitous curse words from the equally boring flat characters telling the stories. The characters being interviewed are so boring and annoying. They all seem the same. They had no endearing qualities.  It was hard to care for any of them. Most of the conversations in this book were about the military about what they should had done or not done, blah, blah.  There is hardly almost nothing about the zombies at all.  I just can't finish reading this book.  Just an bad bad book.
B005HIREJK|5.0|I Love SEIKO brand with black & yellow design. And also it always comes with quite good price and quality.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather app. gives me all I want to know and does it amazingly fast.  I recommend it for anybody.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille is on his &#34;A&#34; game here.  John Corey is his same smart ass self, but even more annoying than usual, if that is possible. The book also hands out some educational tidbits on Yemen relations that are much more fun than reading a text book.  Good solid book.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I loved this show, but for the last few years it started to go down hill.  This season is back with all the comedy and funny moments I love.  If they can take it out next season on the same high note I will say its one of the best series I've ever seen.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn't like how the book ended seemed like Eric and Bill just fell off the face of the earth! Very disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's been a while since I picked up a book and couldn't put it down., but this book just grabbed hold of me and I enjoyed every page.  It didn't hurt that I am a Philadelphia Eagles too...
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my 3 and 6 yr old kids absolutely love it! and I have fun myself helping them pass the knight levels. we highly recommend it!
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|I agree with Stech. If this app was not the free app of the day, I wouldn't have gotten it. The graphics are okay, but the controls suck.DON'T PAY THE MONEY FOR IT! I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a difficult butt still enjoyable game. Get the game. The bosses r pretty easy to kill once you get used to it.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I think he is doing a very good job in these Mission Impossible movies.  Plus the stories are very good.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game to help with reading. My 6 year old loves it. Highly recommended. Also it is pretty cool  to play.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love google search<br />It is very,very fast<br />Can get great google images<br />Much better than my Internet explorer<br />Lisa Frola
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Once I got the 500 free Amazon coins, this is the first game a I came to. I originally had this on my DS and I must admit, it was love at first play. But when the Android version came out, I went freaking CRAZY!!  This game lets you type in adjectives, and more! IF I COULD RATE THIS MORE THAN FIVE STARS, TRUST ME, I WOULD.
B00AWFEBDK|4.0|Diamond's take on the human experience 'until yesterday' is definitely worth reading, but the book could have done with a stricter editor.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I recommend this game better than free because it has all the seasons and free Swiss it will be coming out but it hasn't yet. I don't know why.
B0016492BW|5.0|This movie is the best out of all the movies they make! 1 place is this movie, second place is The Meaning of Life, third place is Life of Brian and fourth place is And Now for Something Completely Different! I know Life of Brian is on Blu-ray so I have high hopes to get it! Surprisingly that the Meaning of Life isn't on Blu-ray though I heard October 8, 2013 is suppose to be its release date!
B005H9B44A|3.0|To follow the story, it is very helpful to read Wikipedia beforehand. Much vocabulary, many character backstories, and preceding history is presumed by the story. The film would have been stronger with greater depth and focus on a smaller number or characters and sub-plots. It was too crowded and confusing. The romance had zero chemistry and the Natalie Portman character, Jane was portrayed less like the graduate student she was supposed to be and more like a schoolgirl pursuing her first crush.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was really disappointed.  Although this book might be an insightful glance into the mind of someone with a mental illness, I thought the book was repetitive and boring.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love reading these books by Khaled Hosseini.  I feel that the western world should read and know more about these cultures.  Hosseini does a great job of bringing these characters to life.  It was hard at first however, the way the book jumped around.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|this app is the reason I passed calculus. Haha but for real. this is the most handy app I have on my phone. every new phone gets it immediately.
B009NY43NY|2.0|As a finale in a series, one would expect something more from the plot. I have read series with endings that disappointed me, but still the story seemed finished. This series however, it seems almost as if the author ran out of new ideas, wrote herself into a corner, or simply left it open for more books. Granted, I doubt i'd want to read another one.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Amazing album with a set of unique lyrics and music. The paradise album edition is worth it for Ride along.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|Love this movie! Its over 20 years old and the special effects are STILL amazing! A must see for anyone!
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Just started this Aquaponic Gardening thing  and enjoy it . and so far this book  has most all the answers to my questions .very informative  on this Aquaponic .I like it a great deal .I would Recommend it to any one starting Aquaponics ....

B0029QRA1U|4.0|This turntable works great and meets all my expectations.  The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 Star rating was not being able to play 78 RPM records.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased with it.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I loved the series and wished to see it again. It was great to go through it again. I wished that it was longer than just one season.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Six months have already passed. Where is the year going???? Tangled will be a FOR SURE pick of my top books for 2013. RUN and READ THIS BOOK. So refreshing to have a male POV. Funny, sexy, witty - what more needs to be said. Well done Emma Chase. Will be eagerly awaiting Book 2.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Not my kind of book, too depressing, like things on the lighter side.  Wouldn't buy another Connley book for a while.

B0026KZ3T0|1.0|And they really charged alot to see this in the theater??? Wow, no wonder why we rent on Netflix or Redbox.... Then when we are disappointed.... its a cheaper loss
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I rented this movie for my grandaughter (5yo) and she loved we watched 3x.  As a grandparent, we watch a few movies.  This rates as one of the best.  I decided to purchase it w/o any thought.I will be surprising my grandaughter this wednesday with the movie.  Also, I am very impressed with the delivery time.  I ordered it on a thursday and it arrived monday afternoon.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am so glad to be a prime member.  What a pleasure to watch shows with Amazon Prime, and so easy to use.  Just great.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|This show is great, it's exciting, fun, and adicting! It's very hard just to watch one episode within the season, u just want to know more about what is going to happen!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Our book club picked this book for our June read and I can hardly wait to hear what the other ladies thought. My personal opinion is that I loved the strength of the women. They grew in substance throughout the book and ended being people we could identify with and admire. They met the challenge of life even under the most horrendous of circumstance. A beautiful story!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|If you are a fan of classic mysteries you know Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  This one volume set of the Complete Sherlock Holmes is a great addition to your e-book library and Kindle.  Keeping it in the cloud allows you to read it on your Kindle, your computer or your smart phone and always be able to pick up where you last left off.
B000JML7YC|5.0|Anyone who has even heard of this book should already know it is a great classic buy.  Of course highly recommend.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This is a story of a future world.  A major trial for its inhabitants and a story of self sacrifice, love and success.  The movie is well laid out and offers a complete story.  Well worth watching although violent and (in my opinion) only suitable for older teens and adults.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Anyone who has even heard of this book should already know it is a great classic buy.  Of course highly recommend.

0062059963|4.0|So the long awaited sequel to The Selection finally arrived on the scene and did not disappoint!  The Elite (The Selection, #2)  by Kiera Cass was an exceptionally well-thought and wove the reader through unexpected twists and turns, not to mention, donned another exquisite cover!  I can only imagine the next one...maybe white (wedding and red white and blue....just saying)?<br /><br />Cass continues with Prince Maxon, America and Aspen love triangle that will keep the romantics salivating for more, but also introduces more themes of rebellion and revolution that prove to be exhilarating and keep you on the edge of your seat, ready to devour the remaining pages.  All of the main characters develop beautifully and we even learn a little more about some of the secondary characters that provide interesting.  There is a twist that you will not see coming and of course, master of her craft, Kiera Cass leaves a definite bridge to The One (The Selection, #3)  that will debut 2014.  We here at All Booked Up cannot wait to get our hands on the final book of the series to find out who will American ultimately choose: Prince Maxon or Aspen...or neither...
B00669MFA2|2.0|J.K. Rowling obviously spent months writing some of the chapters in the last book, why did the film creators feel it necessary to change so many parts?  Yes, I'm aware that this isn't the book, but it does carry the same namesake and therefore should keep what the author intended.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|This item works as advertised.  My only complaint is that it is very unpleasant to look at directly due to the brightness of the LEDs.  I would imagine that is going to be a problem with any LED lantern.  I find gas or incandescent lanterns that put out the same amount of light to be much more pleasant to look at directly.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I hope everyone votes for this to put it up there with the other top-ranking helpful reviews -- this is very well-written.<br /><br />Like you, I'm much more upset by what Harris did to Eric himself than what she did to the Eric/Sookie relationship (though, like you, I too had hoped there was some \\"magical\\" solution to their dilemna -- I initially hoped Sookie would use the cluviel dor to allow her own aging for appearance's sake to slow such that even if she lived out her normal fae-blood life span as Harris had said she would, she could still be with Eric for a long time without being self-conscious). The dramatic and clumsy change from Eric to Sam in this final installment was indeed a huge slap in the face for her fans.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really enjoyed the game and the mini games that came along with it! I would love to see more extras added in!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome. It was first introduced by my friend who owned it in the play store.so I bought it for the kindle and it is awesome. Though it may not host on the hd yet, it is still awesome. It has almost the same features as pc. I totally recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For first time users  type these seeds in, 0.4.0,notches world, caves of herobrine, flat land and jpgameing these are some of the best seeds I .have used so far and some I made by my self.So hope you guys think<br />this is helpful.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was high paced and a page turner. I liked it because of the final ending and the capitol Sean's.  Then again the book was slightly tragic with Katness going insane. There should be a second trilogy about there children.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I really enjoy using this app and have had no problems with it to date.  It makes downloading and listen to music very simple on my smart phone and ipad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|first of all its the best game I ever had on my phone so I love it more than anny thing!!!!
B002361MLA|5.0|This book has helped me so much in life that I keep it next to my bed and on my Kindle.  Whenever I feel angry or anxious, I pick it up and read a few pages to remind myself of what's real and what's not.  It's not the best written book around, but what it says shines through.  Tolle goes to the truth that is the genesis of all religions before they get corrupted by the politics of those who take those religions over.  As such, it can be helpful even for those who adhere to a religion, but it could enhance one's own religious practice.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is one of the only gameloft games where you can pay, but you don't need to. It's fantastic, the a.I. it's great, gameplay is fun, graphics are gorgeous. 10/10 like skyrim with guns.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|The filthy hobbitses.  Oh wut?  Wrong movie.  Yes this one was very nice.  Not a bad shot at jamming a gigantic book into three movies I suppose.  I hope the next two are decent as well!
0385344333|4.0|Like all Lee Child Reacher novels, A Wanted Man is entertaining and worth reading.  One should read the Reacher series in order, so by the time you get to A Wanted Man you are already hooked.  I look forward to the next one, etc.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Was very funny with a pretty good morale.  If you are a video game, don't game jump.  That is the moral.  jk
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl with the Gragon Tattoo is the first of a trilogy that is well worth the read.  It is best to read the books before seeing the movies.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Just adding my 5 star review to counter the 1 star reviews from the multitude of &quot;Genius&quot; Kindle Fire users who had trouble reading the description.  Good app!  It does exactly what it says it does.  Thanks to the developer,  and to Amazon.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Look for the exchange between Castle and Sheila Blaine in \\"A Rose For Everafter\\". Priceless. Sadly, as all series go, tone and quirky-ness never last. I liked Season 2 for that fast paced repartee and those visuals of Nathan Fillion's eyebrow wiggle showing he is thinking of something naughty. He does that much less in 2013.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is silly funny and a really good book you should get it even though it's a lot of money it would be worth it when I read it it was like comedy gold I have read it at least 3 times or even more probably
B009FBX5M0|3.0|As a Bond film Skyfall--as others have put it--was a Skyfail. It was a great action film, but it went far astray from the positive direction of Casino Royale. The main question about the music, however, is, Why Thomas Newman? David Arnold seemed to click into the Barry style very well, and Newman just seems to be mimicking him (instead of himself for a change). As to the limited use of the Bond theme, it actually fits, seeing the limited use of the expected characteristics of Bond himself. I also certainly agree with the other reviewers about the absence of the title song, but that seems to be the trend to make an extra couple of bucks. Still, it is more of just an add on rather than something integrated into the film. I think back to Barry working Shirley Bassey or Tom Jones until they nearly fainted. He knew that the song was an integral part of the score. I wonder at what point Newman actually heard the song, as it has no relation to the score whatsoever.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|My husband says I should have been a lawyer, as I've read everyone of John Grisham books. I like the way he writes and I like everyone of his books. The one I love the most is a Painted House. I'm from the South.<br />Wanda
B005HSL626|5.0|Downloaded fine. This game is great for any time of the day. Love that you have to unlock items it keeps the player interested.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|I love the way John Grisham writes. I've read all his books. This book is okay as it is  light reading. I haven't finished all the book yet but so far I like it. It's not like his other books but it's okay so far.<br />Wanda Valdes from Central America
B008P9M614|4.0|I enjoyed getting the entire series at a reasonable price.  I stopped watching over the years and was most happy to see a product in one package.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Glad I put this on my fire. No stress, just a total take me away from the rest of the world game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this app! I gave this app five stars because the graphics are beautiful and the game is simply addictive. It corresponds with the new Wizard of Oz movie that came out in 2013. It is definitely worth the 99 cent download.

B008J05EL8|1.0|Did I seriously just pay $5 for like 2 fonts that I didn't already have? When people say &quot;rare&quot; fonts I actually expected a variety of fonts that I could use. This is bull. I want my money back.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is a challenging but fun game and I am enjoying it a lot. I recommend it for anyone that likes physics and games that require thinking. It is also really cute and not boring at all.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|Endgame is an incredible return to form and I'll always remember the time I first heard it. They finally went back to their heavier thrash metal roots from Rust In Peace. The System Has Failed and United Abominations were some excellent new records that showed the band heading in the right direction. Usually by this point, the band starts to slip and take a step down but Endgame is a huge step forward from United Abominations. Everything is at it's best here with Dave Mustaine's talented guitar riffs, killer solos and intelligent lyrics. Arguably their heaviest work to date. Megadeth's Endgame is without a doubt, their best effort since Countdown To Extinction and my #1 album of 2009.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game!<br />few drawbacks though. wish there was an easier way to expand the city. You run out of room way too easily.  Also getting rid of hills is way too expensive.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I read this book 30 years ago and loved it. Apparently it has been revised and I don't think it was as good as the original.
B0009YA3YU|5.0|I had never seen this before, but I'm glad I did. It was well worth what little I paid for it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I dont have an Xbox 360 or PC edition although i want one, i found Pocket Edition and i was like WHAT? So i bought it and LOVE IT!! I play it every day, and i got this game the day of my 11th birthday, which was also the day i got my Kindle Fire HD. Buy it.
B0009S2T0W|5.0|It's a very different story, but it has one of the greatest fight scenes of all time. Definitely worth watching.
B003DWG29A|3.0|Not at all what we expected.  Very dark and depressing.  I like a good psychological story, but this does not qualify.  Scary.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I was disappointed, but then many games like this are limited and just boring after a few plays, but that's just my opinion. I'm sorry I wasted time downloading it.
B00358ESI4|5.0|It was both informative and educational and at the same time held your attention. You felt the sadness and the fear of the inevidibilty of death. Everyone should watch and know.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I wish you had more shows of the series to see.  I felt I still needed to see the ending.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I had a hard time putting down the ipad.  Finished book in 3 days.  Only from 9pm to midnight since I do have kids and a full time job.
B005LJITS0|2.0|Ryan Reynolds = Worst actor ever. Get a better actor and maybe this becomes a 3 star movie. He makes a mediocre movie bad.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved the style of writing.  Being written as letters gave an immediacy that wouldn't have been found in a normal story.
0060989157|5.0|After reading Vince Neil's book Tattoos & Tequila and Nikki Sixx's The Heroin Diaries, I had to read this one also. Must reads for Motley fans!
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|What a great album, we really enjoyed the whole album.  The duets are super.  Take a listen you will be glad you did
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a best game I have ever played. the best!!! you should get this game. I loved it. have fun!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pintrest it can keep you on its site for hours before you realize it!!!! love every thing about it
B00181MHQU|5.0|Great story (Romeo and Juliet) and awesome music (Leonard Bernstein).  Even my young, six-year old granddaughter was enthralled with it.  She danced along with the movie!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I couldn't get rid of this game fast enough.  It's not my type of a hidden object game. Sorry again, I can't add more to this review.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Have always liked this movie very much. In 3D it really comes alive, the effects are outstanding. I would recommend this movie to everyone it was a great purchase.
B008HI7BMW|3.0|I'm not an audiophile, but this album does sound a bit small and tinny. Also, unlike the previous soundtrack albums for the other two Dark Knight movies, James Newton Howard did not collaborate on this one, and the elegant note he brought to the score is missing. It's a little annoying how many bonus tracks there are; it's harder than it should be to just buy the whole album. And, of course, the score is connected to the movie, and after The Dark Knight, TDKR was quite a disappointment.<br /><br />All that being said, the upside is that The Dark Knight soundtrack included very little of Batman's theme, an intentional choice made to throw off the audience. Thus, this album has the best realized version that we'll ever get (\\"Imagine the Fire\\"). It also has some nice themes for the new characters. Bane's pulsing electronic theme works better than the actual character, and Catwoman's theme captures the ambiguity of the character and plays nicely alongside the existing themes.<br /><br />Thus, while I wouldn't put it at the top of my list, I've found it at least entertaining to listen to, and worthwhile for Zimmer fans and Dark Knight completists.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! It was witty and funny and romantic and sexy! A great find, you'll love it as well!
B00000DHZJ|4.0|In general, I don't think greatest hits CDs are the best way to go, but Jimi Hendrix does have some pretty great hits. The right choices were made for this album, and the cover art is good. For anyone who doesn't want to delve deeper and buy all the albums these songs originally came with, this is a good pickup.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Considering I only paid four dollars for my copy, yes this was money well spent (which is possibly the highest compliment any consumer can give a purchase).  Zombieland a not too serious take on the zombie genre with plenty of humor mixed into the storyline.
B003DFLZB2|4.0|This soundtrack is an excellent mix of emotions. The James Newton Howard pieces are touching and capture Bruce's relationships with family and friends, as well as his memorable \\"education\\" montage. The Hans Zimmer pounding electronic infused tracks get the blood pumping. And the ending is an excellent foreshadow, both in the movie and in the soundtrack.<br /><br />My peeve is that this isn't a complete score, and the cuts are sometimes different from the movie and  in a different order. If there's a release of music that's exactly what's in the movie, I'm not aware of it. Still, this album is good enough.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I love this show. It is well written and quite entertaining. Each episode is better than the previous.  Amazing show and perfectly cast.
B001BZF9UY|4.0|This soundtrack is a powerful and bone-chilling accompaniment that uncompromisingly conveys the tone of the touchstone movie for a generation. It's hard to imagine how, in watching the legendary Heath Ledger performance, someone could write a musical accompaniment that fits it, without overshadowing or weakening it. But Hans Zimmer did. However, the whole album is full of excellent music that conveys the nonstop energy of the movie. The James Newton Howard pieces, the themes for the nobility of Harvey Dent and the city of Gotham itself, provide an excellent counterpoint. On the whole, this is a soundtrack that ranges from pulse pounding to heart stopping.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars? As with Batman Begins, these tracks are often different mixes from the movie and out of order. Even with the [[ASIN:B001QUYNHO The Dark Knight Bonus Digital Release]], it's hard to perfectly recreate the experience of watching the movie, and that's a shame. Still, a great soundtrack.
0805092447|5.0|Happy to report I've read this to our three grandchildren over the years, great colors to keep a four month old's attention.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Actually liked the book but not the ending.  However, after thinking about it - believe the main characters got exactly what each  deserved!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In true Khaled Hosseini form, managed to weave such tragic tales while offering a sense of hope... Nothing kitschy about this beautifully-written novel.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far so good. it's a little early in the game to request a review. It seems like it will be interesring and fun to play.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The power of words,and their ability to transport us to different realms,not only physical,but those places in our hearts and minds,is strongly represented in this novel. These words unravel in us what we thought we knew of ourselves!! And then replace grander feelings and images for what was ,perhaps,worn out in our own thought patterns. I feel LARGER inside be ause of reading this.......isn't that what we all hope to gain from reading anything?
B00C8985DU|5.0|On May 16, 1976, I saw Wings Over America in concert at the old Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland. Needless to say, I enjoyed the show, and was delighted when Capitol Records released a triple-record set of the entire concert that Christmas.<br /><br />In 1984, Columbia Records, Macca's U.S. label at the time, reissued the WOA triple-record set, and a two-CD set a few months later. That double-CD was issued by Parlophone/EMI a year later, and then in 1986, after Macca returned to Capitol, the Parlophone CD was issued Stateside.<br /><br />WOA was passed over when the remastered PAUL MCCARTNEY COLLECTION CD series was issued in 1993. Except for [[ASIN:B00003IQN1 a hard-to-find Japanese 3-CD set]] that was issued on Toshiba-EMI in 1999, WINGS OVER AMERICA has not been upgraded until now.<br /><br />Again, the folks at Hear Music and the Abbey Road remastering team have outdone themselves. The remastered CD is superb, and there is a third bonus disc of songs recorded at San Francisco's Cow Palace. Amazingly, all of the songs on the main album were recorded at just three venues: NYC's Madison Square Garden, the L.A. Forum, and the Seattle Kingdome, where [[ASIN:B00CG0YMI8 Rockshow]] was filmed. Also included is a bonus DVD featuring the documentary WINGS OVER THE WORLD, plus a new mini-film called \\"Photographer's Pass\\" that features a sequence of still photos from all of the tour stops in chronological order, set to the music of \\"Band On The Run\\" and \\"Soily\\" from the main album.<br /><br />The box is big enough to hold four books: one by journalist David Fricke, a book of Linda McCartney's photographs, a third book of Humphrey Ocean's line drawings, and a portfolio containing the three CDs, the DVD, and the complete tour itinerary, including three glossy photos, replica ticket stubs and backstage passes, after-party invitations, and other souvenirs. I found my old Capital Centre ticket stub, and put it in one of the pouches with the replicas, none of which were from the Capital Centre. Why not?<br /><br />CONSUMER ALERT: If you have purchased this box set, there is no need to purchase Best Buy's \\"exclusive\\" version of WOA, which I mistakenly bought online. The free \\"bonus\\" disc is merely the \\"Live At The Cow Palace\\" CD, which is the same one as Disc 3 of the Deluxe Edition, so I returned mine for a refund, which I received. In fairness to Best Buy, their version is probably a good purchase for the more casual McCartney fan who wants the extra music, but doesn't care about the WINGS OVER THE WORLD DVD (they can purchase the [[ASIN:B00CG0YMI8 Rockshow]] DVD instead) or the other fancy trappings of the Deluxe Edition, which is aimed at collectors. When [[ASIN:B003XX2O8W Band On The Run  (Archive Collection)]] was issued in 2010, Best Buy had [[ASIN:B004AFCOAK an \\"exclusive\\" version with a bonus DVD]] featuring an interview with Paul that was unavailable elsewhere, plus three BAND ON THE RUN songs from 2009's [[ASIN:B002QH2NUA Good Evening New York City [2 CD + 1 DVD Combo]]].<br /><br />Aside from that flaw, McCartney fans will love this package. [[ASIN:B00M2OZMIM Venus and Mars (Deluxe Book)]] and [[ASIN:B00M2OZJPS Wings at the Speed of Sound (Deluxe Book)]] are the next scheduled releases in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection, but I'm hoping that my favorite Macca album, TUG OF WAR, will be \\"archived\\" soon.Capital Centre.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|ZeptoLab excels in doing cute, without being childish. Om nom is just my favorite and Pudding Monsters is just as much fun. Until now, I had no idea mutant puddings could have so much personality. Gameplay is excellent and the graphics are just super. The only change I want is more levels.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|When [[ASIN:B009KKLQKO The Beach Boys Live in Concert: 50th Anniversary]] DVD was released at the end of last year, many fans, including myself, were disappointed that the DVD only contained 21 songs.  I guess that Capitol/Brother/Universal must have gotten the memo, because the double-CD of the concert contains over 40 songs, including such forgotten favorites as \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew,\\" \\"Wendy,\\" \\"Don't Back Down,\\" and even the instrumental title track to [[ASIN:B008LA7RM0 Pet Sounds (Mono & Stereo Remasters)]].<br /><br />For my money, this is the best Beach Boys live album since the original [[ASIN:B000002UT8 Beach Boys Concert]] album from 1964.  Get the DVD, as well as the companion documentary [[ASIN:B008KJZJTK Doin' It Again]], but most of all, get this double CD, because it will probably be the last time that the surviving original Beach Boys perform together.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't get much time to read for fun.  For 'Ready Player One' I made the time.  If you grew up in the eighties, are a nerd, or just enjoy a fun read this book is definitely something you will enjoy a great deal.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was the first book I've read from William landay and it won't be the last.  Good whodunit with one he'll of a surprise on the last two pages. Great pagturner.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Yes the game itself is Good IF it ever works !! Always logging you off for days at a time...very frustrating and I wouldn't tell anyone to play because of all the problems and glitches......
B005PK553C|5.0|I binge-watched this incredible show in a day. It is creepy/smart/twisty and I couldn't stop. AHS is one of the best shows I've ever watched!
B007WFR0QS|4.0|Heard about Emeli on National Public Radio, so wanted to check out her music.  Was not disappointed!  Emeli has a gorgeous, rich and heartfelt voice that makes her songs an absolute pleasure to listen to from start to end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4! I watched season 1 and 2 on instant watch and then couldn't stop... Season 3 was as good as 1 and 2... Great plot!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I play this game every chance I get. It's very addicting and very fun to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge and some fun!
B0073O8BOS|5.0|I thought these guys were done for when I saw that Mustang commercial every hour every day for a year. This is a great follow up to the first album though and I love it.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk rules and there isnt asingle track I dont like.<br />Sooo smooth and the interview track with Georgio is a blast. Shows the long way these 2 Artist came.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Some good stuff, nothing truly great but it is Christmas music and this serves that purpose extremely well, especially considering I am not a She & Him fan. It hasn't turned me into one, I still fall asleep listening to the samples of their other albums but I would recommend this to people that like a little fluff in their holiday playlists.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I couldn't put the book down till the end.<br />No spoilers here, but it isn't like the National<br />Treasure, and probably could never be made<br />into a movie because the locations are off<br />limits.  It would be good if they did, because<br />Tom Hanks needs to star in a movie that<br />doesn't bomb.
B008VSKPJO|5.0|An amazing voice and just one great song after another. I always tag a song of hers to any playlist I make. A great resurgence of the swing/big band revival from a few years back. Others decry the Brian Setzer sound etc but I think there should always be a place for people that know how to be inspired by history and make something to draw attention to those that came before. Give the kids something to discover all over again I guess.<br /><br />Plus she is an Irish Rock Mom. That is just something we should all support. She could have very easily fallen into the Irish Folk Vortex to never be discovered by anyone outside of Temple Bar in Dublin.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|When I find a movie that I can relax and watch over and over, I buy it.  This is one of them.  Good acting, great special effects and a story that flows.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I delayed getting this album for ages just because I kept hearing how I NEEDED to download it by people in oversized glasses, beards, and wool hats. But it finally went on sale so I chucked my juvenile oppositional defiance and embraced cheap music and have enjoyed it ever since. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but there are some great songs mixed in with a bunch of so so songs. They haven't really broken any new ground here, it is good because it feels familiar.
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|I bought this thing.  Folks, I like Lee Child and his books, but let's face it,<br />Tom Cruise is 5'9&#34; and the storybook Jack Reacher is big.  Lee Child said<br />Tom Cruise brought the &#34;feel&#34; of Jack Reacher that other actors couldn't.<br />I translate that sentence he said to mean &#34;Tom Cruise will make me more money<br />than an actor that actually fits the part.&#34;  Steve Austin would have been the<br />perfect actor for this, and there were no lines that the movie required Sir Alec<br />Guiness to read to get it right.  The story followed the book somewhat, but<br />was totally miscast.
B001VGFMBY|4.0|I love these guys. The world needs more funk and these guys bring it. Six more words required. Done now.
0307730700|4.0|Overview: This book tells the amazing life story of a man named Adam Brown who battled more than just the Taliban. In the midst of it all he found Christ and that is what saw him through. Adam grew up in Arkansas and wanted to do nothing but play for his older brother's high school football team. He wasn't a star but he did his best. He also was just an all around good kid, until after high school that is. After graduation he fell into the wrong crowd and ended up a drug addict, putting his family and friends in danger and ultimately himself in jail. After serving his time he went through several attempts at rehab but always failed, until he met his future wife. After meeting her he still had slip ups with the drugs but he had finally turned a corner. Through a series of small miracles he actually was able to enter the Navy on the tract to become a Seal and was able to put drugs behind him for good. The rest of the book follows Adam through his amazing accomplishments as a Navy Seal despite numerous injuries that would have sidelined other men, and an account of the battle in which he ultimately gave his life for his country.<br /><br />Pros: I learned a lot about the military that I was not aware of by reading this book. I also got a different perspective of the lives of military wives and children and gained an even greater respect for them. And, not that I ever doubted it, but reading accounts from the \\"War on Terror\\" strengthened my conviction on the necessity of it. Also, this book is a real testament to what someone with a real faith in God can be capable of, and of God's grace to see them through.<br /><br />Cons: Adam's life was not pretty. This is not a book for children. Adam's family wanted his story to be told without reserve in hopes that it could help others. That being said it covers alcohol, heavy drug use, profanity (in some of his correspondence), and violence on and off the battlefield.<br /><br />Conclusion: I enjoyed reading this and I would recommend that every American Christian read this book or one like it. Our Military deserves to be revered and respected for what they do for our country and we need to be remember why they must do it.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|Like so many others I heard Sail and checked them (him?, haven't checked wiki) out. I thought it was a good album just not worth the full 9.99 amazon and itunes asked for but once it hit the sale rack ... err page... I picked it up and found it to be a good deal. I can't listen to it from start to finish, because I don't need that much synthesizer in my life but it is pretty good in a shuffle with other stuff. Sail was a good choice for them to release as a single and to draw attention to a band that might have been overlooked during the electro pop craze. I doubt I would have given it a second glance had it not been for that and I might have missed out on some other good stuff. I don't quite get the genre smashing that is being attributed to it but I am old and jaded. When I hear a song in a mix I know immediately who and what I am listening to. I will check out the next album to see if they get the one hit wonder tag so many great songs have yielded over the years.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|I enjoy John Greene as a writer. I read \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" and loved it. However, I was sadly disappointed with this novel. The moral of it, which is stated at the end like most stories, was definitely one I can relate to. The rest of the book though I had a hard time reading. I pretty much forced myself to finish the whole thing because I hate not finishing something I started. I don't totally recommend it, but maybe I'm also being a little biased because I hate hate math. :p I hope others can enjoy it better than I did.
B0045EA1P6|4.0|Not the most flattering review title but I honestly thought that when I heard it in its entirety. You can really see where they were going with this. It lacks all the chart busting of the follow up but you can clearly hear them working towards that with this release. Like a really good practice run before it all clicks into place the second time around. Not many bands get substantially better after their debut. Jane's Addiction is about the only other one I can think of, maybe if I put more thought into it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a great time killer is super fun and awesome and my nine year old loves it. LOVE IT
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Great start for the show.  It was a like at first sight.  With the later seasons like grew to be love.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|While the graphics may be too retro for some people, the gameplay is solid.  Definitely worth a shot if you like Bejeweled-style games.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love it!  I enjoy decorating the aquarium after going through the levels. It helps the kids to learn how to control money too!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The book starts fast, then drags along for a while.  I love the witches house at the end.  Then cliff hanger so no time to waste onto the second.
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|This album is progressive rock at it's finest. A thick and densely layered concept album. There are many moments of musical muscle being flexed, but never at the expense of emotion and great songwriting. Simon Collins is an amazing singer with his own voice, yet he learned from some of the best (His dad Phil and Peter Gabriel), and it shows in the melodies and love of a great feeling that never gets overshadowed by musical wanking. Matt Dorsey, Dave Kerzner and Kelly Nordstrom weave thick waves of epic sound that recall the past but look into the future. This is not rehash of prog rock's past glories, but a springboard into where it should go next. Unlike many modern prog albums, this one gets more intense as the album progresses. They save the best for last, yet still manage to start out swinging. I simply love this album. My advice is to buy it, throw all your expectations out the window, listen closely and be blown away!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I lo ve it ,I'm older so it's taking me time to adjust to everything but II especially love the audiobooks because my eyes aren't like they used to be ,would recommend highly
B0012E6R3W|5.0|I have several albums from these guys dating back to the 80s.  This may be my favorite.  I love the tone of the recordings.  The guitar work is mind blowing.  The metal and songwriting are amazing.  The singer's voice is phenomenal.  It's great metal.  I can't say enough.
B005COO1X6|5.0|The setting for this story was a lot of fun; I've often wondered what goes on in those abandoned rest stops along the highway.
B0027MJU00|4.0|After reading \\"Gone Girl\\" I was a little apprehensive with a less experienced sort of backward piece. First, because \\"Gone Girl\\" was wicked jaw-dropping writing. Second, because I was deflated with the way it ended. Not with \\"Dark Places\\" though.. I feel like I just woke from a glorious, raw, nightmare; the kind where you wake up in a coffin of sweat that your body has heavily saturated into the mattress. The kind where a nap is required immediately after because your brain has short circuited deciphering the difference between reality and nothingness. The poisoned purity that Flynn created through the characters hovered an angst of energy around me from front to back. She is a maven who creates dark places in the mind that few are willing to venture. A-M-A-ZING!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is a complete set of everything Columbo - even the movies.  So many clever plots and famous guest stars...what's not to like?
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|most annoying game EVER!!!!!!!!! whenever I run out of (LIVES) I go back to the beggining.  it would be fun without those lives
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|A friend recommended this book to me; she loved it...I hated it.  I found it SO boring and predictable.  Pretty simple thinking in my opinion.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|just a short review. everyone else has already said the obvious.  yes, this is an astounding recording !  singers, orchestra, conductor, interpretation,  packaging,  all absolutely outstanding.  really brings out my kef reference four speakers. this is from someone who loves the knappertsbusch parsifal and the furtwangler tristan.  however, i want to add that one should never worry about possibly damaged items arriving. amazon is one of the most reputable firms i have ever dealt with regarding this issue.  they will make sure you are ultimately totally satisfied. they always have for me. [[ASIN:B008J1QFLU Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen (Super Deluxe)]]
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it.  Didn't watch it originally and was able to get three seasons watched in one week!  Will make you want to buy Season 3.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was very fascinating and had us captured. Definitely worth watching multiple times. It even has an edge in the end.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put this trilogy Down!!!! I can hardly wait to read More about Christian & Ana. If Mrs. James writes another book I will be first in line to Buy It! ;) Thank You for Taking Me Away to a unknown world...=)
B000ID1J5E|5.0|excellent acting, action packed.<br />Meryl Streep is always one of my favorites.<br />As always I am happy with Amazon service!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superb acting writing scenery costumes ... No trash just good old fashioned storytelling...keeps you wanting to see more..can't wait for Season 4 5 6 etc etc etc
B0034DGPEU|5.0|it held my interest. i really enjoyed it.  i hope to read more books like that.  Wish i knew what else is like that book I already read  the help.
B008J4L3E6|4.0|A little confusing to start with but once you had identified all the characters it was a &#34;just read a little more before I put it down&#34; story.  Almost on a par with James Patterson
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is honestly a must read. I loved it so much! Its a great read for all ages. Order it now!!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Good, liked the first couple books the best though. Overall one of my favorite series. Excited to read the next book.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini's first two novels are exceptional. He is an immensely talented writer and a gifted storyteller. So my expectations were obviously high for his latest work. I was hooked from the first page. The writing is again superb, and the characters are very compelling.<br /><br />However, I grew tired of the book's structure. It felt as if Hosseini or the editors were trying to be a bit too clever, shifting constantly between time periods, and introducing new protagonists every 40 pages - while there was really one over-arching story that kept the pages turning. It was a bit frustrating, as he's such an immensely talented writer that there's no need for all the twists. His use of words and his telling of a story is his genius. He should've stuck to that. (At one point, I felt like I was reading a Choose-your-own-adventure novel, and I felt like there could've been a family tree of sorts to help the reader keep everyone straight)<br /><br />In the end, I tried to view it more as a collection of short stories.<br /><br />But again, the writing is superb, and Hosseini remains one of my favorite writers.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great from start to finish. The ending had me at the edge of my seat and can't wait for the next edition! Would recommend it to everyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book wanted me to never put it Down and in some ways it really inspired and spoke to me
B00B22IJXK|3.0|It was ok, but you can't do anything that it says you can.I don't suggest getting this although it is good for doing small editing.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It was a quick and good read. The story was good even though it was very similar to random other movies and stories. The characters were believable even in the odd circumstances they were put into. All in all a fun read.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love yahoo e-mail. What would you do without your e-mails? Easy to use. Keeps you connected to your important messages.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Wow, from start with \\"intense\\" to end with \\"reprise\\", armin does another succesfull and variating album, with every musical aspect and fidelity taken to the top, along all the album has a deepbassline which I personally love the opening track has his classical intro, little dubstep in the middle, some sort of reminder of a classic daft punk song and finishing with heavy trance, a violin is the main element completing this as a new gem...<br />Next is \\"this is what it feels like\\" has a catchy chorus, nice piano and guitar riffs<br />\\"Beautiful life\\" hard hitting bass!! Great hook, good vocals, new and classic armin sounds blended perfectly<br />\\"Waiting for the night\\" beautifull voice excellent hook, memorable synthline, excellent song overall<br />\\"pulsar\\" another armin classic, good trance I love to hear and deep sounding bass<br />\\"sound of the drums\\" intro with piano and vocals, again, hard bassline!<br />\\"alone\\" another female vocal track with lots of feeling...<br />\\"turn this love around\\" this is my least favourite song, its good tho, but not my style, female vocals again<br />\\"wont let you go\\" this is what classic van buuren sounds like! The classical intro is excellent and aruna sounds great!<br />\\"in 10 years from now\\" is a transition, a break an intro to an excellent song<br />\\"last stop before heaven\\" pure deep dark trance, this genre is getting harder to hear, which I dont understand why, is the most introspective and reflective motivating genre, thumbs up for this gem!!<br />\\"forever is ours\\" uplifting intro, good synthline, good vocals<br />\\"love never came\\" yet again another classic armin intro and sound, excellent vocals<br />\\"who's afraid of 138?\\" The more than classic whom boom boom sound of armin, excellent breakdown, melody, riff and all,... at high bpm<br />\\"reprise\\" an orchesta at the intro, complete instrumental song, the great guitar sound of eller! Miss it on the album!, I wish he could participate more on the next album as in \\"imagine\\", andthis was the end of the journey,<br />Thanks to armin for another memory collector
B008XG1X18|5.0|I  like all the recipes, ideas,crafts and gardening ideas. It keeps you occupied for hours upon hours. I  love it.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|We saw this years ago. My wife is taking her PhD. and it was required for an ethics course assignment. The movie is layered with all kinds of ways to think about the movie, from a philosophical or just every day living standpoint. You can analyze or just go with the flow.<br />Performances were strong and believable by Connery (Forrester) and his unlikely yet developing relationship with Rob Brown (Jamal Wallace). Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Pitt, April Grace, Naturi Naughton and Busta Rhymes star in supporting roles and kept it real. F. Murray Abraham  won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Antonio Salieri in Amadeus and in my opinion plays a similar role as the close to achieving, but never making it, Prof. Crawford. He sees Jamal's talent but seems jealous of potential for the achievement that eluded him.<br />Here are the layers - is it about achievement? striving? power? race? prejudice? friendship? finding one's soul? the meaning of life? If you don't like any of that, there is the role basketball can play.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a great way to stay connected to family and friends. I enjoy facebook very much. Love to post pictures. It can be addicting.!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|game can start off slow if you don't manage those initial coins wisely.  Don't bother wasting coins trying to save something that islikely to fall off the sides.  The only exception would be your first set of whistles which you want to complete as soon as possible.  Right now i'm at about level150  and have almost 3000 coins
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I gave this season's Castle the best rating for the continuity, the portrayal of the challenges of<br />Beckett trying to achieve the best she could by going to the Federal level, while having to balance<br />that choice against staying in her comfort zone as a NYC detective and also trying to maintain<br />her new depth of relationship with Castle.  The actors in this series, as developed by the writer's,<br />continue to show an increasing intensity of relationships that could be disrupted by each choice<br />that they make, but saying more would be a spoiler. . .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|free, engaging, a bit of action, updated regularly.  Not much else you can ask for.  This is probably one of the games that everyone should have
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Great casting, acting, cinematography, special effects and sound track but, sadly, it doesn't come together in the edit room (or does it?). And I really wanted to like it. The 2nd time I watched it I wasn't as distracted by the rapid time line jumps as much as the 1st. Being able to spot the players the 2nd time through helped a lot. Maybe an edit that gives the viewer time to enjoy the epic unfolding before them would have been more enjoyable.<br /><br />After you come to terms with who is doing what, it suffered from the clichéd villains that are required by the movie industry today (big oil, slavery, homophobia, corporate greed, global warming, etc.). Not that I am a fan of any of the aforementioned bad guys, but come on, let's stop swiping the easy moral high ground just because no one will come out in opposition.<br /><br />And with my gripes, I plan to watch it again (and again). There's something about this movie that makes you feel as though there's more there and you're obligated to find it because you've been a lax viewer. Which is why it should be classified as an experience (as opposed to a mere movie).<br /><br />Damn those Wachowski's.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Propositional Statement: Imagine Dragons is another arena-rock version of The Killers.  As much as I'd like to dismiss them and tell everyone to buy Hot Fuss instead, I can't.  That's because Night Visions is way too good.  Whether they sound alike or not, Imagine Dragons are writing catchy songs that fill an album to the brim with energy.  In my opinion, the album fizzles out a little towards the end (from \\"Every Night\\" on), but by then you've already gotten your money's worth.  And forgotten that I.D. sounds eerily like The Killers.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|While aware of the hard life in North Korea, Harden does a good job of  sharing Shin' s emotions and motivations as a lifelong prisoner in Camp 14.  A scary, and sad picture of a world so far from what the rest of us know, Shin proves to be a remarkable person without ever intending to be so.<br /><br />We can only hope that someday places like Camp 14 will not exist.
B007WPM4P0|4.0|Birdsong was a perfect movie to watch on a cool rainy night--tragic, dark, and a movie where all doesn't go as it seems. A bit slow in the beginning, but well worth hanging in there for the rest.
B000U6DU92|5.0|We have just started watching this tv series via Amazon Prime.<br /><br />There are some lengthy reviews that cover what this show is about in depth. So I will keep this review short.<br /><br />Overall this is a very enjoyable show. My children (ages in range from 9 to 13) have enjoyed it. The story line is about a town that is tied to a business named Global Dynamics. (GD for short). GD is a lab like environment similar to other Government Labs. Engineers and scientists and other sciency type of people are encouraged to make great leaps in technology and inventions.<br /><br />And with great leaps come great challenges and thus the show is built around these wierd situations that wouldn't normally occur. There are several people who are not as smart around this town, the sherrif being one of them. These people have to often solve these wierd situations. The talking house gets mad. The DNA of the sherrif's daughter gets changed so she ages faster than normal. An extra sun is developed. etc etc.<br /><br />This is a great show. The love lines are very realistic in many ways. The interactions between the people in the town stay true from one season to the next. There is not this gratuitis show of sex to 'keep the excitement'. There is a genuine idea behind this that smart people are the ones that make the great advances in our world and that smart people are not lacking in common sense, not geeks, not nerds- but real people who are also smart.<br /><br />We have enjoyed this show.<br />Enjoy.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|exteemly fun game and your not obligated to buy anything! love the dinosaurs and I hope the game keeps expanding.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Not thrilled about the layout. But all my feeds transferred intact from google. Will suffice now no reprieve coming for Reader.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My kids - 2 and 4 - loved this movie and so did my hubby and me. It was not too scary, had subtle adult humor, and was not too violent. The Joker was portrayed well; it was Heath Ledger like. This was a great movie to unwind too after a long day of playing.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|If you buy the album because you like the single, 'Get Lucky' you may be disappointed. The majority of the album has a different sound than that track. However, I do appreciate the other tracks.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|an oldie but a goodie.  The kind of movie you never tire of seeing over and over again. good all around movie.
B00BD6KPFU|3.0|Why there is no HD/Blu-Ray version?<br />$24.99 + tax + shipping is not worth for a low quality SD show!!<br />I will rather wait for the HD version and for now borrow it from the local library - nowadays any library generally keeps at least 4 copies of any popular movie or TV shows.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|What can  I say that most of you don't already known.  It is a classically good movie.  I feel good every time I watch it.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I simply love Harry Bosch. No way around it. He aggravates me and makes me think. These short stories are simple renditions of Bosch in action. I see some readers were really disappointed. I knew going into them that they wouldn't be the typical Connelly novel, so I was okay with the quick turnaround of them.<br /><br />I would rather read a short Bosch story that buzzes by quickly than a bad novel by another writer.
0061537969|4.0|Since I talk to my dogs, it's nice to think they listen and respond. Many Truths are presented and even though there's some sadness, Right triumphs. That coincides with my philosophy of life.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book was written for a paycheck . Considering the depth the author put into all the other books it was sad to see her &#34;phone it in &#34; oh well wait till the book goes on the $.99 sale and read it .
B005HSL626|4.0|I like to play with my 2 year old granddaughter. We play for hours. Best game ever, really good. Thanks.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Life long AIC fan, own all their albums, yadda yadda.  I bought this the first day I could because AIC is one of my favorite bands.  I was hoping for some of the growth that AIC was showing towards the end of Layne's career.  Don't get me wrong, I like the new singer.  He meshes so well with the rest of band, and its hard to tell that it's not Layne out there singing.<br /><br />This album rocks, but there is no growth from the band.  This might as well be Black Gives Way to Blue, pt 2.  I think that Jerry has fallen into a song writing rut.  I still enjoy all his music, but there is none of the experimenting that earlier AIC albums gave us.  Jar of Flies?  Sap?  C'mon guys, stretch yourself again.  Show you have a sense of humor again.  Get used to your new singer, and spread your wings again.<br /><br />I definitely recommend that anyone looking at this album buy it.  Just don't expect much difference from Black Gives Way.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a pretty decent love story and I enjoyed it and was glad that it ended up with a good ending.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin has such a gift for meticulously parsing the world of war two centuries ago and weaving it all back together as a whole story. There have been so many wrong-headed commentaries about Abraham Lincoln and his presidency. This book has the heft of history as truth.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Lincoln, what can anyone say? Well, I've read most on the man and yet this book covered much more ground than I believed possible. I couldn't put it down. The insight and flow of Ms. Goodwin's writting is historic in itself. The Movie was brillaint, but it only covered that last months of this great man's life and times. The book covers so much more. Read it and be moved. Read it and know that Lincoln was a complex, brilliant funny man, who knew he was meant to move history. If I could go back in time and meet anyone, it would be Abraham Lincoln.
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|Haven't seen one like this in a really long time, if ever.  Gets deep into the psyches of troubled people whose journeys intersect with hard-hitting results.  A favorite.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Angry BIrds is both entertaining and challenging.  Though we are miles apart, it is a game that my daughter and I enjoy competing against each other in.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Except you have to buy the rest to make it better, as theres only few of each thing. Very addicting and cool though!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Jack Reacher, a story about a wanderer that solves crimes and helps people in need. Don't be confused by the premise of the movie; that says it all right there.<br />The movie starts quickly: a sniper kills five people, a bunch of characters are introduced, a plot originates, and (spoiler) a conspiracy is unraveled. Movie over.<br />All in all, I did not dislike the movie. For pure entertainment value, it was worth a watch. We see an interesting premise for a movie involving corporations, retired army men, some good fighting and action, and alot of shooting. A decent movie, but lacking at parts.<br />First off, I felt through a good portion of the movie that I was watching an episode of Law and Order, or some other cop/ lawyer drama. They would sit in the office for long periods of time, trying to solve the case, while the story just got away from me. If you like cop and lawyer dramas, then perhaps this movie is for you. I did not find it particularly realistic or interest grabbing, but perhaps will appeal to someone.<br />Secondly, there were quite a few oversights within the plotlines, or just general things that I noticed wrong with the movie, or just plain did not fit. Others I just felt were just plain stupid, and did not add whatsoever to the story. (Spoiler) There is a scene in the movie where a dirty cop takes a defensive position behind a hostage, in which relatively no part of the cop's body is showing. Nonetheless, Tom Cruise's character bursts around a wall and kills him in one shot, regardless of the many shots being fired in his direction in a very narrow  and tight spot. Just dumb, reaching parts like this. Maybe that's why he is called Jack Reacher. Because many of the parts do just that...they reach, but fall short of realism.<br />Sidenote: Tom Cruise is looking very old in this movie, like his skin is stretched over his bones, and not in a healthy way. Just my opinion, but the shirtless scenes did him no justice.<br />Do I recommend this movie: It wasn't terrible, but it was not great either. You may like it, you may not. You may finish watching it and say 'Meh, it was okay', much the same as I did.wasn't terrible, but it was not great either. You may like it, you may not.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|My friends and I love playing this game and getting better each week.  We try to beat each other each week.  Game is fast and good eye game.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I needed a solution to be able to listen to gaming on my XBox.  Always had to mute the sound so I wouldn't disturb others in the house when I was gaming.  At the recommendation of my Son that had this same device, I broke down and purchased this unit.<br /><br />The sound is GREAT, very rich sound and I didn't realize what I was missing with the sound muted.<br />Very nice not having cords stretched across the room that might get tripped on when moving around the room with the lights out.<br />The only negative is I get some popping at times in between game cycles.  I have not heard it during a game yet, usually when one game has ended and voting for the next map (COD).  It doesn't happen all the time, usually when first starting game play.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is fun and addicting! just wish it were a bit easier to get pearls. even though, I love this ap.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She was 1 at the time and learning to bounce.  She loved it.  My nieces and nephews range from 3 to 6.  They all enjoyed it tremendously!!!  However, it is not meant for older children.  An 8 year old got in it when no one was around and of course was too rough and popped it.  But I am ordering another for the younger children since they had so much fun with it.  Add pit balls and it is a BLAST!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game.  The the sounds are great. The action is pretty realistic.  The physics that are at the heart of this game really make it fun.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I was excited to play this game, but when I went to start it, the controls were horrible, and pacman got caught because of it.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I was ready to give this a 1 or 0 stars because I thought the controls were so bad. Picking things up isn't as intuitive as you'd think. With other games where you have to pick things you have to touch and hold before the thing is available to move. This game is different, you have to touch and swipe (almost immediately) which means you have to be fairly accurate when you pick something up. I love this game. Loved it on the DS. I just think people need to know about this. It's not a glitch, just a quirk in control. Now I'm giving it 4 stars. Not 5 stars because there's no other place to find this quirk out (it's just assumed you know already and that's annoying).
B00A7W29BE|1.0|Yes this is an app for devices with a rear facing camera.  Butt Kindle Fire owners were promised a free app every day.  Making the &quot;free app of the day&quot; one that doesn't work on the Kindle Fire makes no sense.  This isn't the first time either.  This is the app store for the Kindle Fire.  What all other devices access it and use it for their apps they should all work on the Fire.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Very good music and a great story. The combination of lyrics and great melodies offer a unique and timeless musical trattoria. How could it have taken so long to be recognized?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed the book, good writing and very clever. How does someone think of this stuff...has she talked to my wife?
B000065V42|4.0|This movie really is timeless. I loved it as a kid, and now my 10 year old loves it just as much.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read this book after I read the last other 3 and I liked them all very much, but it didn't matter, I enjoyed all author books. there been one or two much about, but he's batting a thousand with me. Hope he keeps up the good work.<br />Thank you David Baldacci for your work.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|Love the talented cast as well as Cyndi Lauper's music!  For a non-musical theatre person, she made the music so intricate!  Had the pop side but also kept true to musical theatre.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|To those people giving it 1-3 stars, leave. Now. Thank you.<br />Don't listen to them. It is, honestly, the best season so far. Watch, buy and enjoy!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An excellent book that everyone, especially middle school kids should read!!!!!  Heartfelt and honest.  I highly recommend this book to all!!
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Sincerely this is one of the most curious stories I've ever read. It's impressing how Gilian Flynn can make us share with so much reality the hardest lives of some of the most unfortunate and downgraded human beings... and you'll be sleeping only when you come to the end of the story!<br />Francisco Oliveira<br />Parede-Portugal.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|It keeps your intrest all through the movie. The actors were great. The story line was good also. I'd watch it again
B009MO57H6|4.0|When I first watched it I got into it and started to really like this movie. I wish Jill Valentine came back though. She is smoking hot! Anyways one thing bothered me that they're mission is global it isn't its just Alice and the group are stuck in another umbrella facility its virtualized to seem as they're in different countries when really they're in a facility planning to destroy it. Good movie though watch it. To continue resident evil movie series.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|While I'd rather watch paint dry or go out to the garage and hit my thumb with a hammer my wife loves this movie.<br />When I see her watching it I say, &#34;Oh, I see you are watching the dumbest movie ever made!&#34; She just gives me &#34;The Look&#34; and keeps watching.<br />I guess to each her own.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in theatres when it was released. That was about 4+ years ago. The general plot is about a guy Chris Gardner struggling with his son in San Francisco, after some trouble wife leaves him and their son. Gets kicked out of his house. Continues to make ends meet by selling bone density scanners. He's walking the street one day a.d sees a guy pull up in a ferrari Chris asks him two questions what does he do and how. The guy is a stockbroker so Chris applies for an internship. And he is trying to pursue happiness from a struggling life.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is totally Nicholas Sparks. It's one of his better writings. I couldn't put it down. I definitely suggest it to everyone who is tired of the same teenage story plots out there today.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|I like this movie. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are great actors. The other actors in this movie are good too. I like the modern description of old times movies really good and entertaining. If you buy this make sure you buy from Amazon.com their products are real brand new and great!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like this game it has real animals mythalogical animals and more. I also like how there's more to do than just wait for animals to get money. though it does bug me that all the lions are depicted as male yet can still breed
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I can't play as a girl. The only girl I can be is the lifeguard. I want to play as other black woman. Give us a playgroud like a home, multiple stories, household items a car you know like once we go on the playgroud. It's a really good game overall.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have unfortunately become an addict ever since finding out about Pinterest! It helps with organizing even the simplest of things! :D
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is awesome so much fun fun I know you will enjoy it as much as I have  my children love it also
B005HSL626|3.0|Avast and Kaspersky both see this as malware. Uninstalled. But was cool before last update. If it was only one of them, could argued false positive, but both of them makes it concerning.
B00969PR18|5.0|I got this while I was in Paris visiting grand kids and family.  It helped when we were exploring the neighborhoods.  Took it with us on our sight seeing excursions as well.  Nice that it works without access to a wifi connection..
B000FC130E|4.0|The author makes a joke himself in the book about this story being similar to Oz. I really enjoyed this book and I am glad I finally read it and I look forward to more of his books.
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|OK, it's not CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, but solid storytelling has its own merits.  First read almost 40 years ago, still an enjoyable read.  Surprised how closely the film follows the book, tho Coppola deserves props for excising some of the cheesier portions of the novel that are not vital to the story.  Wonder if any of Puzo' s Mafia books that followed are worth reading?
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|liked it some. i won't be doing this in the future if it's required. so this is my last time for the survery
1439170916|5.0|On page 388 in the paperback edition, the author writes, \\"Down to their innate molecular core, cancer cells are hyperactive, survival-endowed, scrappy, fecund, inventive copies of ourselves.\\" No kidding, Sherlock. That seems to be putting it mildly. By this point in Dr. Mukherjee's excellent book, I had come to appreciate the near-infinite challenges of combating cancer. The author's motivation for writing \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" was an effort to answer many of the questions his patients have asked him about the disease. There is no simple way of describing it. The doctor felt a \\"biography\\" of cancer would give people a better understanding. Despite being a very busy, full-time oncologist, the guy pulled it off in this deservedly Pulitzer-Prize-Winning work. Many of the assumptions I had about cancer were incorrect. Dr. Mukherjee's combination of the disease's long history as well as interspersing it with a few personal stories made for a very interesting and humane work.<br /><br />He covers such topics as leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, Pap smears, mammograms, carcinogens, mastectomies, chemotherapy, the Jimmy Fund, stem-cell research and end-of-life care. Sometimes, the scientists and doctors working on finding cures were their own worst enemies. Egos, politics, ethics, greed, and arrogance played (and still plays) a big part. Cigarette companies correctly come under some especially harsh treatment by the author. If you are interested in a more in-depth history of the odious tobacco industry, I suggest you read the superb \\"Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris\\" by Richard Kluger.<br /><br />At its core, the book is a celebration of scientific discoveries as well as inventiveness and the many people who have spent their lives tackling cancer. At times, the author's book had me optimistic and, at other times, slitting my wrists seemed the way to go. Never far in the background is the knowledge that legions of innocent people are taking dirt naps because of cancer. \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is very well written, highly informative, great history and I wished it had been around when some of my extended family members developed cancer. Do yourself and your family a favor and read the darned thing.ar in the background is the knowledge that legions of innocent people are taking dirt naps because of cancer. \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is very well written, highly informative, great history and I wished it had been around when some of my extended family members developed cancer.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|enjoyed the movie. it isn't a good policy to make the the buyer fill out a survey that has a word limit.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Not a real challenge for gaming adults, but a great game for young kids cutting their teeth on such things. And as an avid reefer, I can say that the game accurately educates kids on some relationships between reef inhabitants.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|There are three types of songs on this album<br /><br />1) Songs that sound like Suit & Tie (Fun/smooth/upbeat songs)<br />2) Nsync throwback song (just Mirrors actually)<br />3) Bad songs<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are more of #3 than 1 or 2. For all the hype, this was disappointing
B00340ESIS|5.0|Slightly dated, but truly the last screenwriting book you'll ever need. So much practical, useable information, that sets you up with an approachable workflow. Loved it. Wow

B009VIZDLI|5.0|Read this over two very busy days. I fell in love with Don, the protagonist. I loved the ways he measured and evaluated life. I want to embrace his rigid meal plan and have lobster in my bathtub every Tuesday night.<br />Although Don is a highly esteemed genetics scientist, he views life with a beautiful naivety, he knows the workings and technicalities of people, but just can't grasp that element that makes us chaotic, individual works of art.<br />And I laughed! Yep, I finally came to understand the intent behind LOL. There is a particularly amusing dance scene. I also enjoyed the talk on Aspergers. Go Aspies!<br />Don is obviously bordering on being dysfunctional in life and yet, his idiosyncracies started to make sense to me. I found myself agreeing with his practical approach many times.<br />Now there needs to be a movie!<br />This has become a favourite, and I'd read it again.
0425263916|5.0|I never read a book that fast in my life. I was changing a timing belt ordered a part in and done great book. I feel for the characters Gideon and Eva should just get married. Get the whole series it's worth it. This book is amazing get it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Thought I tried them all - then I found this!  Love this game. I may never play the others again.  Look forward to updates.
B00AG297GK|2.0|not to my liking not as funny as I thought it would be  pass on this one bad humor  theres a lot better ones to watch
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Being able to see how long it will take to charge my kindle, change the battery acid color, and see how charged it is is fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This ramble looses the plot so many times it becomes almost comical, except it doesn't.  It might have been saved with better production design but isn't, and the DP chooses nearly identical lighting throughout the time settings.  I hope everyone got paid a lot to laugh off this mistake.
B00CBKVMG8|4.0|Love the old time feeling if this movie, the honesty behind it. Ryan goslings character wasn't what I expected but the romance made it perfect.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Fun game, everyone at work is playing it.  I am the only one with a kindle fire and cannot get an update?  GLU has an updated v 2.1 but amazon only has the 1.1.0.  Why cant we get the update yet???
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Unless you've been hiding under a rock, the angry birds aren't unknown to you, so I'm skipping the content review, to mention the problem. If you buy the ad-free version of this here,  and you also have the google market/play store on your device, google will &quot;update&quot; your amazon ad-free version, with their free ad-supported version. Don't know where the blame lies, but it seems to be a problem with all the angry birds titles. The only way to avoid it is to go into the google store and set it to prompt you before updating.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|We ordered this and recorded this for a grandchild for their birthday.  This way even though they don't leave near us they will recognize our voice.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Avast! Mobile alerted on the latest update as it was trying to install. Maybe a false positive, but not worth the risk to me. Removed.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I did not like the movie at all. A complete waste of time watching it.  Don't bother ordering this one.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|friends told me about it so i ordered it and i loved it matthew is just the type of guy who would do almost anything for films in these days
B007XIC1GI|5.0|There's not much I can add to other reviews, except for my own complete amazement, my secret courtship with his words late in the evening, my longing to be a true friend of his during his hardships, yadda yadda. There's a certain humor to some of his passages and a little bit of a Metrosexual delicacy to some of his reactions to situations which makes him seem like a vulnerable human. It's touching, but its sick & twisted at the same time. I understand how and why we should push the boundaries, especially question the rigid & closed-minded Christianity mindset that some ignorant people have. Being perfectly perfect is sick and no one can be purely good. We all have evil s*** to work out. So be real and stop pretending you don't have any bad ideas and thoughts. Another raw & interesting ebook: [[ASIN:B008YNRAEY Dear Dad]]
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's really fun but sometimes the car is hard to control.  I think that you should get it. It's fun.
0385349947|5.0|A must read for men and women alike! It won't solve world peace but it does challenge how you think and it gets you talking which is good! ;)
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|They really scored a homerun with this game. It is a bit like temple run, but with completely different concepts. If you like superheroes like me, you will absolutely love this game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can't believe I read this again just as soon as I finished reading it. I never have done that before but I did, just so I can laugh so hard all over again. This story is full of mirth, every word that came out from Drew's mouth is worth repeating and re-reading. Though this book was just loaned to me by a good friend, the laughs I got from this is certainly worth more than twice the book's price. I think it's the most entertaining book of the year no doubt. You learn a lot about boys and girls/men and women's relationships from a man's perspective, and believe me it's enlightening and hilarious. For those that are just beginning a relationship and are wondering what your man is constantly thinking, this is definitely the book for you.  The sexual banter between Drew and Katherine is exhilarating and their sex scenes is so frigging hot!<br /><br />I don't remember ever disliking a man-whore kind of a guy like Drew at the same time love, adore and can't get enough of him like this one. Each encounter of Drew with his 4 year old niece are tender moments that would just melt your heart into a puddle of goo. There are so many extremely funny incidents your jaw and tummy would be hurting from laughing but the Thanksgiving dinner scene tops them all. I really, really love, love this book that I am going to get my own copy just so I can keep it on my shelf to read again and again. ( did I say I love this? :) ) This book is simply amazing!<br /><br />Such a great book for a debut I can't help thinking maybe Ms. Chase was at onetime a stand up comic! :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|game is fun and lots of things to do with interaction with friends very fun family game lots and lots of fun
3836527286|5.0|Whoever loves the Beatles, the Rolling Stones or classic rock at all will love to have this book. There are great pictures in it and it also has the unquestionable quality of Taschen's books. I really recommend it. It worths every penny.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|This was a good movie at first  ut it should have been a 1hr movie.. the acting was good but these 2 are falling into a typecasted pattern.. Ashton has to stop acting dumb..<br />stayed with it to the end - but struggled a little to do so.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|The story takes place at the very beginning of the Star Trek Timeline. The individual episodes are somewhat integrated; The acting isn't too bad either. I likely wouldn't have bought the entire season but since I have prime it was a good deal. I would recommend watching this season if you enjoy Star Trek store
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I'm not a Tarantino fan, but I did enjoy this movie. Lots of blood and gore, but also lots of humor and steriotypes.
B0054LJGWS|1.0|Footnotes at the back of the book instead of on the page chop up the reading experience.  Prefer the real book to the kindle edition.
B005HED08I|5.0|What fun to revisit some of my favorite shows!  Quality is great and no commercials. Can't beat that!  Love Amazon Prime!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This helps so much , After my daughter is finished I can with confidence be sure she has them all correct! Love this !
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It's opened my mind to whole new way of thinking! You will will never look at your partner int he same way
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a cute and fun way to play, much more interesting than farmville.  a great learning experience for kids to so they can learn about the ocean. can't stop playing it.  Im a biologist and i can guarantee this is worth the fun and money.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a nice conclusion to the Southern Vampire Series. It truly wraps everything up with a nice bow. Kudos to Charlaine Harris for giving Sookie her HEA. :)
B008602KQI|1.0|Who would keep having children just so that they might be killed for sport? This was very boring. Glad I did not waste money to see in the movie house.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|This was well done! A passionate story of Christ-like love given by 18th Century monks and the South American natives to whom they ministered.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I am a fan of the band and love this album. quite varied in style. It grows on you and is at least as good to their past 2 albums and strong the whole way through. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|This was a great kids' story, with the unbelievable but acceptable adventures of a young crime reporter and his faithful dog. The computer animation was constructed with unusual warmth.
B002MGNNFY|5.0|I think the movie can speak for its self, but if you love time traveling quantum physics badassery you'll love this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!It is very similar to Temple Run but better! You should get this game!!Subway Suffers is Awesome!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy read and I can take it everywhere. Love the plans and comments from others. Great way to challenge scriptures through other teachings. Keeps me in the Word.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife is one of the best shows on TV.  I cannot wait to see what happens next!  There are so many little l e plot changes it keeps you guessing.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Good book, sad to see the series end. Wish there was at least one more conning out, love sookie Stackhouse
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Star Trek brings back characters like a comic book, the best never really die, and that is not a bad thing.  This story tells a great back story and keeps you hooked doing it.  It has a way of processing necessary info in a way that doesn't bore you and still continue the story that has you stuck in your seat reading
B009NXV2RK|5.0|as usual Tom Clancy keeps you from putting the book down and up to date as this is what is going on today
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book for about 2/3rds of it.  The ending is highly disappointing. Language and structure are not bad at all.  But really, it felt like the author did not know how to unscrew the story after it went too far.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. The characters become very developed in this book, and you grow very attached to them, so to speak. Well, I did anyway. It was written beautifully and smoothly with amazing descriptions, so you really develop and image in your head of the circus. Loved the whole thing, I'm sad it's over.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I like the amount of detail about life in Germany between the first and second great wars.  I was a child in Great Britain during the second war but had no idea of conditions in Europe.  This gives an insight into why Hitler was so esteemed by so many.
034580404X|5.0|it was just like a brand new set from barnes and nobles but without the expensive price. same book better price.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|The three D cells should last for 2 years in a continuous pulsing mode (to alert you to where the lantern is in case of power loss). I decided that candles were a poorer choice for power loss duce to the fire potential.
630542845X|5.0|Incredible film. I've seen it bunches of times. I always feel I connect with deeper possibilities about who we are and what we are capable of each time I see it. Highly, highly recommended.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|*** updated Review: This game is pathetic... If in a multiplayer other player challenges you, it logs you out so I am giving only 3* now..<br /><br />This is a nice game, but has its flaws while we play on and make advancements get a message that connection broke and you want to Reload or Quit and if I reload all the advancements are gone which is terrible but still giving a 4* hopefully they fix it. the time to build the resources is quite high and when I skip it skips the production rather than time to complete, it would be nice if you give the aura it skips the time and complete the production.<br /><br />Other than this 2 majore flaws I still find the game rather interesting.
630471193X|5.0|This is a haunting and beautiful film that takes you on a whimsical journey into love, life, and what we are here for. It makes you really think about what's possible for us as humans, and the story is great. I loved Travolta in this. I've seen it many times.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Another wonderful score by Mr Giacchino.  Great album in its entirety but here are my favorite selections.<br /><br />London calling - Beautiful piano piece reminiscent of Glass that evolves into a villainous reveal.  Superb.<br /><br />Ship to Ship - Flurry of strings drive us into battle.  Horns swell and pierce. Ends with a nice call back to Eidelman's score from ST-VI<br /><br />Warp core values - Hero movement. Sacrifice and Heartache. Into glory we go.<br /><br />Buying the space farm - From sorrow and tears to revenge. Bittersweet piece.<br /><br />Kirk Enterprise - Light and hope pave the way.  To boldly go.  A welcome cap to this adventure of the Enterprise.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|My son and I watch this show together.  I'm only through a couple of shows but I like the idea so far.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Loved the setting of this book and the themes connected to societies expectations of young ladies during the early 1920s.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I enjoyed the intertwining stories found in this book.  I am looking forward to seeing how the movie translates this work into a screenplay.
B005COO1X6|5.0|another great work by the master; holds your interest from start to finish, injecting just enough humor to engage and pulling you in with just enough empathy to the characters
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is book is an amazing, all time classic. It obviously is an old book but the content and attractiveness could keep anybody with this book from beginning to end. It is interesting  to see a young mans life turn from innocence to bitterness. I give my 5 star rating especially for the end of the book. Though It is shocking, it leaves you satisified and knowing that you have read one of the best classics ever. A definite must! Enjoy!
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I would not waste my time on this movie of course unless your a huge matthew mcconaughey or Channing Tatum fan, then I guess have at it. This was a total waste of time for me. I ended up turning it off half way thru.... Need I say more. Both of these guys have done much better in there acting career.
B00847KFDS|3.0|Impeccably recorded, this long overdue guest star studded reworking of some of John Fogerty's best known songs doesn't quite make it. With the exception of Track 14, the guest vocal stars add very, very little to John's own impeccable vocals while Track 14, an inspired, gospel/cajun tinged rework of Ike and Tina Turner's definitive version of Proud Mary sounds so good on the sample that it justifies buying the complete album. However on the actual silver disc version Allen Toussaint's signature piano is mixed way down and turns the Rebirth Brass Band into a ersatz version of the Memphis Horns. It loses momentum about 3 minutes into the 4 minute song - like a bike tire with a puncture. Based on the Amazon sample this could have been THE definitive, high energy, NOLA authenticated version of this much loved song. It was a disappointment
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|This is another resident evil movie, lots of fighting, blood and bullets flying everywhere. So need I say anymore. You either like this stuff or you don't. I liked it for what is was, a distraction from reality.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|This game is different every time you play it. It really makes you think and strategize. It doesn't take long to play and you don't need to have WiFi to play.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This was a good movie for any Saturday night movie with the kids. I would recommend it to any parent.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|You will figure out what's wrong before it happens, but it's a nice ride.  It'll also make you think about some kids a little differently.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|Awesome performances<br />Storyline a little hard to follow at times<br />Would still recomend to anyone based on the performance alone.
B008602KQI|3.0|I hate to be one of those people who say the book was better, but it was.  It is okay.
B00AL3OD7C|5.0|I'm usually wary of remastered editions and reissues but I think this one is definitely worth it. Listening to 2112 in 5.1 was incredible, it was like I was listening to it for the first time again. Add to that, A Passage to Bangkok and Lessons are great tracks that assure this album isn't a one trick pony. Plus the title track made me jealous of my brother. His birthday is Feb. 1st and last year his birthday was on 2.1.12.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Love finding an author I haven't read before. This was my second Picoult book to read and I couldn't put it down.
044656740X|4.0|I had to read this book for my econ class, after you start reading you realize it have very good information. I strongly recommend reading this book. Honestly, it help me in with my achievements.
B002DW92SE|5.0|This book was very enjoyable. I have read a couple other Nick Hornby books, and this one was right up there for me.<br />As an obsessive music fan I found this book very enjoyable and funny. It was a good light read. I consumed it very quickly.
B009X00E18|5.0|I am very happy with this case. There are cheaper ones, but this one stands nicely and is so far very good for my Kindle Fire.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've used different mice in school and at home but I've never actually owned a gaming mouse. My previous mouse was a much smaller wireless Logitech mouse for school.<br /><br />Now that I'm getting heavier into gaming, photoshop, 3D Modelling, etc. I figured I'd get a new mouse for home that doesn't require me to suck up batteries. Figured, hell with it, I'll get a precision gaming mouse. For what it, the price is also better than competing brands and it had good reviews, so I went for it.<br /><br />Not dissapointed!<br /><br />Being as I'm used to a much smaller mouse, this one took some getting used to.  The software is awesome and the buttons are fully mappable as expected which I love. I've got the 3 left side buttons set to G, F, and R, respectively, for gaming. The extra buttons on top are used to browse through my desktop and tabs easier, since I'm always doing a lot at once (photoshop, music studio, 3D modeling programs, etc, and switching back and forth between them).<br /><br />Don't let the main picture fool you, this might look like a small round kinf of mouse but it's a pretty regular full-sized beast. The left and right clickers extend about half of the mouse's length which I personally adore because I don't cup my entire hand around the mouse, I usually keep my palm up and fingers curled on the bottons. So instead of using all the weights it comes with for a heavy rigid feel, I use two weights to keep it solid and hold it lightly in my fingers so i can move it easily.<br /><br />The DPI settings are awesome, and incredibly sensitive. While I use my desktop I like to have the sensitivity on the upper-mid range, though when I game, I'll probably be using this on the third of the four settings for that extra sensitivity. No longer will I be constantly adjusting the sensitivity in game menus as often. The ability to switch between DPIs on the go is fantastic, and you can custom set the sensitivity levels for each of the four settings yourself.<br /><br />The build itself feels just a wee bit cheap on the left side butons but other than that it's definitely solid.<br /><br />If you want a nice ultrasensitive mouse for a lower price range than the competitors and you want a nice comfortable feel, than this is the mouse to get, hands down.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|great game. love doing hair, clearing pimples, makeup, dressing &amp; jewelry. like doing the whole bit. need more shoes &amp; accessories. I play this with my daughter &amp; granddaughter.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|HAVE NEVER HEARD OF GARY BEFORE I LISTENED TO SOME SAMPLES OF THIS ALBUM.  I WAS IMMEDIATELY WON OVER TO HIS UNIQUE STYLE AND HIS FANTASTIC GUITAR WORKS.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever. Diane Keaton and Jack shine as a pair of same age lovers. He can't believe this is the relationship for him and it is all she thinks about.Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny.The crying at the typewriter is classic Diane.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|CLASSIC IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT WHEN REFERRING TO THIS ALBUM.  HAVE ENJOYED IT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND NOW HAVE A FRESH CUT TO ENJOY INTO THE FUTURE ON MY GALAXY ANDROID NOTE 2.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool. I play it almost everyday!I totally recommend it for everyone who loves horses and is an outdoor person
B0095P31L6|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie, but was disappointed. The characters were uninteresting and the story was not particularly strong.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Interesting twists and a head spinning look at relations in the third world, but the end seem to arrive suddenly
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The characters are highly relatable (at least for this bookish web designer), and the narrative arc reconciles atomic and digital sensibilities. Mr Penumbra's has proven that lit can be light without being dumbed down. And utterly enjoyable, just by the way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was such a great book I think other people would read it.<br />I liked this book because of all the action parts
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I absolutely loved \\"Fall of Giants\\". It was my first experience of Ken Follett's writing and the story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I was thrilled when \\"Winter of the World\\" went off the 3-day checkout list at the library (have they seen the length of it?) and I was able to have it to myself for more than a week. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Ken Follett is very good at telling stories, and this book is no exception. He has developed characters that you can enjoy reading about, and his level of detail and ability to create a situation that immerses you. He skillfully manages to drop you into a moment of time and convey the excitement, fear, and atmosphere of the time. His characters are drawn-out enough to give them distinct personalities, but not over-developed, which, due to the sheer number of main players, would probably confuse you while reading.<br /><br />I have two main issues with this book. The first is the actual writing itself. I don't know whether this is the fault of Follett himself or his editor, but there were numerous grammatical mistakes (a colon and comma are not the same thing, and the former should not be used every time there is dialogue), a lack of completely taking the book from its British form to an American one (several words were changed from British English to American English for this release, but others - such as \\"practise\\" and \\"high street\\" - were left in), and an abundance of over-exposition. I understand that, in a book of this magnitude and about these intricate historical events, exposition is necessary. But having characters repeatedly \\"recall that, in xxx year, xxxx tanks were brought into the city\\" is not the way to go about it. If you can't find a way to bring that factoid into the text in any other manner, it's probably not necessary to the story.<br /><br />The other issue was that this book, much more so than its predecessor, required a suspension of reality to make it work. When setting a book during the years 1933 - 1949, there are certain historical events that one wants to include. Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Stalingrad, the fall of Berlin...these are all important. However, it's not necessary to have every single one of them experienced first-hand by your characters. One character alone managed to be present at Pearl Harbor, D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, and the formation of the United Nations. And, while I'm sure there were a few people who were at all of these, the odds are extremely low. Given that, by this point, nearly all of the characters are actually related to each other in some way, shape, or form, it makes things even less probable. At the beginning, I felt that Follett had done a good job setting up his characters to be in the right place at the right time in this novel. But as it wore on, it became tiresome. I also had a bit of frustration with Follett's politics creeping onto the pages a bit too much. In \\"Fall of Giants\\", I felt he did a good job balancing different political views. In this one, any non-liberal/labor character was essentially evil, and all of the left-wingers were inherently good. I find it hard to believe that he could not have found a way to write at least one inherently good conservative, or one bad-apple left-winger.<br /><br />I truly did enjoy the book, but it paled in comparison to its predecessor. As another reviewer pointed out, it does make me wonder what the final book of the trilogy will bring, given that it's called the \\"Century Trilogy\\" and we're only 49 years in. But I'll probably still read it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I just got my Kindle Fire and for me this is a great app. Sometimes it feels like you need a ouija board to discern the little battery indicator on top. Not with this, it clearly and largely tells you the status of your battery and what you can do with the remaining charge. It's not sexy, but it sure is useful.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|loved him from the beginning so glad he can still sing wonderfully. No one else can do it so well.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We like to watch it for the comic relief and the characters are interesting.<br />We usually watch it on our lunch hour.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|It is a rip when only basic fonts are used and the functionality is questionable. What a waste of money!
1451695195|5.0|I am loving this book. Whether you believe in Heaven or the afterlife, I think Mr. Alexander takes you on a beautiful journey.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A well written ride of a tale! Everyone who reads this story will relate to it in some way. A page turner- time literally flew while reading this book! Wonderfully written, highly recommended!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Gives me an error when connecting but won't say what kind of error. So haven't been able to use it.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This is a solid interface. My monitors and cans sound very nice through this box.<br /><br />Vocals sound nice too, and there are no latency issues whatsoever, very crisp and sexy.<br /><br />If your on a budget, i recommend this box as well as the Golden Age FC1 mic.<br /><br />Holla at ya boy
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story is good and makes you want to find out what happens next.  Heard the author interviewed on NPR and it is an interesting twist in how authors can get a book out to the public.  I bought the second book right away, but haven't purchased the third one.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|This cd is very nice for those of you that's a Stevie Nicks fan grab this cd you'll enjoy it.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Nice to have on a 5 hr flight.  I watched on the flight outbound and my husband watched on the return.  Action packed .  I ave read a couple of the books.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Its still hard to believe Whitney Houston is gone I've always loved her from the first time I saw her on star search when she won over Brook Sheilds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is well digiened game and very additive and very good to play it is so additive that I got my whole family in to it I enjoy it very much I wish it were Easter to get gems for those who don't wish to buy them
B00005QDW5|4.0|If you're a pink Floyd fan then you'll wanna grab this cd it very good a lot of great songs on here.
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|Not nearly as good as the other movies.  I kept waiting for some really big shocks and surprises but they never came.  Never mind the fact that there were scenes in the preview that weren't in the movie.  I HATE when trailers do that.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|The game is fun but you have to buy a ton of stuff and the levels are too short and easy.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|The pace of Side Effects was excruciating. It took far to long to present the main characters conflict.  The resolution, while meant to be clever, was logically and legally flawed.  Life is short...don't waste it on this movie.
B0067R0APK|4.0|This app gives one of the best forecast for rural areas that I have ever seen. The alerts and maps are very easy to use.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|If you have been having problems with charging your Kindle Fire you need this app.  My kindle fire was giving me a hard time with charging where sometimes it won't at all.  But after looking to see what I can do (without have to exchange it) I saw someone say to get this app and ever since I got it I have not had problems charging it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What a show! Like so many others, I missed this when it originally aired. I was just astounded by the complexity of the characters and the quirkiness of blending the genres of western/scifi. It just works. The only thing I can compare it to was being 7 years old and watching Star Wars for the first time. Like Star Wars, the story and characters mesh in a way that makes you feel connected to something larger than yourself. I was sad when I watched the last episode. I am not a comic con, costume wearing, scifi nerd but I would consider myself a browncoat now.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|This is a great movie! It is satirical and still a &#34;fairy tale.&#34; I love it! It is very different from the book, but I definitely prefer the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband is a big fan of British TV.  I grew up in England so it's always good to see something great from home and this one is excellent!
B0029O08WA|4.0|This is a great soundtrack for the second movie in the Twilight Saga. It has many great songs from the New Moon movie. However the song, &#34;All I Believe In&#34; by Amadou & Mariam and The Magic Numbers was not on this soundtrack. It shipped quickly and there were no issues with the order. Recommend for sure!
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Downloaded but would not run on daughters Nabi2 or my Polaroid tablet. Went on Amazon on laptop and see now that it is not compatable with our tablets. Bummer:(
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read the other two books and couldn't wait to read this one, this is book is really good in details
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|another version of temple run guess it is ok will probably try temple run again.  this hard to play but free
B00992CF6W|4.0|A great game for tablets,ios,etc,but needs a few things.It needs to be more updated,version 6.1 you can't use tnt,redstone contraptions,and there's no food bar.But it does have mobs,metals,and coal,but I've never found diamond.Overall,good game but needs to be more recent.  4/5 for me.
1433502410|5.0|A great book to have, love the way you can read it and understand what you read in our English that is spoken today!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The greatest puzzle game I've found. Much more mind bending than other, similar escape the room games while not being impossibly hard at the same time. Amazing graphics, fantastic Sherlock Holmes esque music, and eerie sound effects makes this game so immersive and incredible. The added tinge of certain mythology makes this creative and adds mystery to the entire premise. Excellent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is completely fun to play. All ages will enjoy playing this game. I recommend this game. All sorts of animals and scenarios.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I have not read this book in well over half a century. But out of nostalgia and curiosity I ordered it for no other reason than that. Upon reading the very first pages I was reminded both of my youth and of the genuine beauty of the English language to express the thoughts and intent of the writer. The language of the 18th century, the idioms, phrases and &#34;salty&#34; talk was refreshing against the genuine lack of color in most modern writing either in print or on the screen, TV or otherwise. It was an excellent adventure for a man of 70 as it was for the boy of 10. Pick it up, place yourself in Jim's buckled shoes and enjoy. Recall if you can the excellent movie with the dastardly Robert Newton as Long Johnn Silver and see the adventure; the wild Ben Gunn, the portly Squire, the good doctor. Enjoy fine writing and a fine adventure.
B006ELF6AI|5.0|The first season kind of lost me a few times, especially when it came to figuring out what G stood for, other than that, the crossover editions kept me tuned in.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Good hand eye coordination and problem solving skills with this app.  Good for kids and adults and fun for the family.
1401310672|5.0|Ordered this book more as a gag gift for my mother who is new to texting and it is so funny. Lots of laughs.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is one of the greatest &#34;History of&#34; programs I have ever seen. I was mesmerized for the whole program. I recorded it on my satellite receiver, watched it several times. Decided I'd better search Amazon to see if it was available on Blu-Ray. (just in case, ya know!)<br /><br />I 'came of age' during the early day of The Eagles. Learned a lot about the group I never knew.<br /><br />I found out recently that The Eagles will be playing here in Dallas in October. *I* will be there!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really like this app.  I use it a lot. It helps to have a mini office on my kindle. I can change or make corrections on docs. Also great for downloading docs to read later.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|It was a wonderful, descriptive story of Cain and Abel.  Updated of course.  I live near the Salinas Valley and intend to go to the Steinbeck Museum one day
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good book about a woman who has been a victim of abuse and learns to love again. You will wonder why domestic violence happens.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|The concept of using random prime numbers for the chapters was enchanting.  I felt bad for the father.  He was doubly rejected.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it a great app defiantly worth it. Weathering is no good in comparison. Easy to use with no glitches
B0055SJVPW|1.0|I received this item with a hole in the front of the case and a scratched Blu Ray as well. I had to send it back and get a replacement. The second one arrived with the words &#34;DISK MADE IN MEXICO&#34; all over the back cover. Like I want to see this all over my back cover!!! I don't think so!!!....I have asked customer service many times to send messages to the warehouse, which they said they did, to please check all my purchases before they leave the warehouse, but I guess it is falling on deaf ears at the warehouse!! Oh well, there is always Walmart to purchase my blu ray's from!!
B009IF82SK|4.0|I'm quite sad to report that I found the sixth season to be an order of magnitude lower in quality than any of the first five seasons. There were some decent moments in season six, but I never had to be on the lookout for just moments in prior seasons.<br /><br />I think that it is mostly the writing that has suffered, and some poor character development. The actors mostly seem to be up to snuff, they just have less to work with. The show hasn't fallen off a cliff, but it is on some gravelly road.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are addicted!  We started watching this on Amazon Prime and finished it up couple of weeks ago.  Just ordered season 3.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am happy to see that Marvel has managed to do a good job of taking a story from comics to the silver screen and not loose their fan base. Of course it doesn't hurt to have a bunch of talented actors that love what they do enough to do their job well. I just hope they sign Robert D. on for another 5 movies.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game! I've gotten every star in every box and have gotten every achievement IN THE ENTIRE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You feed two Om Noms instead of one! One is the main Om Nom and one is his ancestor! If you're in the Stone Age you get a Stone Age ancestor!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I loved the movie when I watched it in the theater many years ago. A father and son separated by &#34;reality&#34; reunited by life as it really is.
B0064MPXFA|2.0|Lousy acting by all of the actors.  It's almost like they are just reading their lines and showing no real feel for the characters they are portraying.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This is a good movie if you keep in mind that it depicts the slavery them in a strong and probably accurate light. It is also gore movie along the same track the his other movies were made in.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|As good as anything he's ever done. The man is a brilliant, talented artist and I've been blessed to be able to follow his work over most of my life.  I appreciate that he hasn't cranked out mediocrities just for the sake of production but has put so much thought into this album that it radiates Bowie. Yeah I'm sqeeing like a fangirl, but that's what I am and have been for a long, long time. I hope I don't have to wait another ten years for an album. :)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't like the writers style. I would have put it down after the first couple of chapters except my daughter insisted it gets better. The books plot finally revealed and my interest finally sparked, I still found myself skimming over pages unable to read every word. Hers was an audio book, so perhaps the book is easier to listen too than it was to read.
B00942G4UA|3.0|complains about things but does not offer any alternative's. doesn't tell you how much food would cost if large companies were not running it.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|Seven chapters in and several glaring spelling errors. I always expect better from people who make their living as writers.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre novels never disappoint.  However I must say this one  grabbed me and held on throughout.  The structure and weaving the multi layers in addition to staying right on today's world affairs keeps me enthralled.
B006QSLBC6|4.0|It kept my interest throughout. Quite a few famous actors that I haven't seen for awhile. I would recommend this for just about anybody.
B003JA5MO2|5.0|I got the 180 gram vinyl version of Mojo. The records are very well made. Reprise doesn't mess around. I've seen some poor pressings lately but this not one of them. The quality is incredible. The packaging is also great. The inners are audiophile poly (very nice!).<br />The audio quality itself it also excellent. Warm and rich sound through my tube-pre. Levels are great, no need to fuss with anything. Just great music in the best format. I wish all pressings were done this well. I'm impressed and couldn't be happier with the records.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|A bit of fluff. I expected more from Tommy Lee and Meryl. Steve Carrell is not believable as a doctor.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I simply LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!! I wish season 4 would be free for those who have prime :) My all-time favorite show
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is awesome I am with you just about finished building until the game stopped<br />will get the full soon cant wait
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really a neat little app. They don't seem to know their horse breeds or colors, and the pink unicorns are a stretch, but it is still a cute thing to have a virtual horse.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I am having s great time playing this action packed game. There is no time for boredom while playing!!!!  So go for it!
B0074JODP8|3.0|Disappointed to find out one of my favorite songs, &#34;Bird on a Wire,&#34; will not play through but stops about 1/3 of the way into the song.
B001LX2J22|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It makes the new Hanibal series even better. I love them all.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is fun for all ages very cute and a great way to just clear your mind you don't have to think just do
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond dash is fun your able to play with other people off of Facebook and able to challenge them in it to see who has the highest score
B00BC24NT4|5.0|the best cold war writer for international espionage stories has made the transition to the world of counter-terrorism and he has brought all of the incompetence of the good guys along with him.<br /><br />fantastic novel. crafted as only Le Carre can do it
0060594896|5.0|Jack will make you take 100% responsibility of what you are and what you want to be.<br />A must read for all those willing to change.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|This is a great record from Josh Homme camp.  I particularly like it while driving around town.  If you like Queens of the Stone Age, you will like this.
B00846REIS|5.0|This novel is quite the page-turner. From beginning  to end the reader is enthralled with the ex changes between Eva and Gideon. With each twist, the reader is left wanting more and wondering what will happen next. This novel is an entertaining and erotic adventure. Great read for anytime.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while.  And I have to type 9 more words to finish so they will take my review
B0002YLC24|1.0|PROs: Cute, charming, well-directed, some nice shots of Paris, cares about the environment (as they blow smoke in each others face).<br /><br />CONs: Overwritten, banal, shallow, sophomoric, phony, smarmy, ethically-challenged, inane, predictable, pseudo-poetic, straining for profundity, posturing, whiny, self-absorbed, and basically uninteresting characters that lack chemistry.<br /><br />I think that covers it.
B00AERRKHA|5.0|I fehlt at home at once, even after I stopped reading her books for some years. I want more SF from her again.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Watching this movie in 3D was a really nice experience ! My Family and I had fun since this is our very first 3D movie we watched at home !
B008Q00KEW|5.0|This is Star Trek at it's best.  Wanted to watch it after seeing the new Star Trek movie.  Picard is at his best and it includes some of the subtle humor I appreciate in the series.
193700788X|1.0|I have loved this series from the start and purposely didn't look at any reviews before I bought and read DEA. I wish now I had. This was a complete and utter waste of my time and money. CH said that she would wrap up in a good way, but I didn't see any wrap ups. Just a lot of unresolved issues. Don't even bother with this book, you'll be disappointed also.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was excited to see Lincoln.  Just couldn't wait.  I think they could have shortened it.  I found it rather boring
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Actor George Dillon has said, \\"The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently.\\" The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work, Anonymous, one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age: the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I, the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, a prominent aristocrat and court insider, was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare, plays and poems of romance, tragic political intrigue, and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that, after 400 years, still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.<br /><br />Described as a \\"political thriller\\", Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that, like many films of the genre, begins with a jumble of names, images, and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything, but Emmerich invites us, in the words of Diane Ackerman \\"to groom our curiosity like a high-spirited thoroughbred, climb aboard, and gallop over the thick, sunstruck hills.\\" Steering us through the maze of Tudor history, the film makes credible the startling events of the time, providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience, cluttered streets, and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.<br /><br />Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film, Emmerich, citing Shakespeare in Love as an example, says that the film contains an \\"emotional truth\\" rather than a literal one because \\"the drama is the primary concern.\\" He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction, the writing of John Orloff, the cinematography of Anna Foerster, and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscar-worthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford, Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization, it more than makes up for it with style, spectacle, and an involving story.<br /><br />To some, the film may be skating on narrative thin ice, Emmerich, however, told an interviewer that \\"if we provoke, let's provoke all the way,\\" and provoke he does. According to Anonymous, de Vere, in addition to being Shakespeare, was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and, in 1573, the father of a son with Elizabeth, Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel). Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste, with neither the \\"Virgin Queen\\" nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi, the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armento) by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.<br /><br />The author of the play is a well-known writer who, though he is soon released, is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play, the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years, then forty years, as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil (David Thewlis), where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death. We also witness his marriage to a teenage Anne Cecil (Amy Kwolek), daughter of William, a marriage that never produced any lasting satisfaction for either party.<br /><br />As we return to present time, Oxford is forced to hide his identity because of the biting satire of his playsthat lampoon some of the more prominent members of the court, and also as a result of a political arrangement that becomes clearer later in the film. His initial choice to front for him is the same Ben Jonson but Jonson refuses, passing the mantle to Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor for the Lord Chamberlain's Men who seizes the opportunity. In a superbly comic performance, Spall portrays Will as an illiterate money-grubber who can barely speak coherently but is willing to sell his name to Oxford at a premium cost. The heart of the plot, however, focuses on the attempt to seize power from Cecil's son Robert, an episode that is known to history as The Essex Rebellion of 1601.<br /><br />This insurrection, led by Robert Devereaux, the Second Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) results in his beheading and the imprisonment of Southampton who is sent to the Tower awaiting certain death. Oxford's attempt to persuade Elizabeth to save their son results in a political deal that makes us privy to why Oxford was never able to reveal his authorship of the Shakespeare canon. While some critics may proclaim the movie a moment of singularity that indicates the end of the world as we know it (even before 2012), Anonymous may have the opposite effect, opening the subject to a wider audience who may be able to view Shakespeare and his times from a totally new perspective.<br /><br />In Robert Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Jubal said we're prisoners of our early indoctrinations, \\"for it is hard, very nearly impossible, to shake off one's earliest training.\\" If my intuition is correct, the prison gates will soon be swinging wide open, and the shaking will begin in earnest. As Victor Hugo said, \\"Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\\"
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|So glad beyond words this show got renewed for Season 2. The acting, direction, visuals, everything is far beyond the scale of what is usually on network TV. Yes it's gory and scary as hell, but the psychological factor is off the charts.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|good movie, thorough background on main characters for those who need to get up to speed with Star Trek . Action packed after the first right from the start. Wraps up nicely and am looking forward to &#34;Into the Darkness&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have been wanting to see this program for the past year and was so happy to watch season one and two on Amazon.  Watched them all within one week and it left me dying to see season three.  Fell immedidately into love or hate with the characters, all wonderful actors.  Maggie Smith what a hoot she is.  Now watching season three the last two nights and have one disc to go.  Borrowed season three from a friend.  Great show and great to watch on my ipad late at night!
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|At last there's a historical fiction series about my ancestors, the Vikings!  What I like most about it is that it really brings them to life - their culture, their religion, their laws, their daily life.  Several of the main characters (Ragnar Lothbrok, Lagertha, and Rollo) are based on actual historic figures, but of course, liberties are taken with their stories for the purpose of storytelling.  The accents are all over the place, and the dialogue is sometimes clunky; those are the major drawbacks.  However, the acting is good and sometimes great; the characters look like flesh and blood people; and the series builds momentum as it goes on, with episodes 8 and 9 my favorites.  I can't wait for season 2!
