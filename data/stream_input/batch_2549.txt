B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A little bummed that this has been extended to a 5 book story after being sold as a triology. That being said I still love Gideon and Eva. I can't wait till they get their true happy ending. Crossfire!
0345529057|5.0|I love  knowing I have all four books.  Wikk get the last book when I am done reading these.<br />Great collection!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was heart capturing and probably one of the best I've read including the other 2 books . There were some things I didn't want to happen and I didn't completely understand but, thinking about it I understand why Suzanne Colllins wrote it like she did. Things like this happen in really life and we have to accept and move on.<br /><br />This is a good read for teens 11 - upwards and young adults alike. Also, for people who like science fiction like myself but, there is some violence.  The characters in the book are very interesting especially Katniss, Peeta, and Finnick. The setting is very creative and over all I just love this book<br /><br />You might not really grasp what's going on the first but, if you take your time and really read the book carefully it'll make a lot more sense and you'll really infer the events taking place. When I read the book a second time I understood what was happening more.

B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend, known for their multitude of instrumental arrangements and focus on world-music brought into what is otherwise classified as an indie-pop sound. Well, that was Vampire Weekend on their first two releases, but with Modern Vampires of the City we experience a change, or even stray, from their well-known world sound. Instead, MVotC tends to focus more on the \\"pop\\" side of Vampire Weekend's talent - and, needless to say, does it in style.<br />While their previous releases are great in their own ways, neither Contra nor their debut captivated and pulled me in quite as much as MVotC. Of course a lot of fans are going to complain about their change in sound, but it can be easily argued that this isn't a change, but, rather, a maturation. Vampire Weekend is able to explore more sublets of their sound in a more simplistic style and form - essentially perfecting every part of their instrumentation that you never heard or focused on in their previous releases.<br />Modern Vampires of the City also sees Vampire Weekend at their best lyrically. \\"Unbelievers\\" alone is a song with so much depth in meaning, it's almost impossible to sum it up in just a few words.<br />I never bothered to purchase Vampire Weekend's previous releases - rather, I was satisfied just having borrowed them from a friend - listening to one or two songs here and there. After hearing Diane Young, however, I knew that there was something different about this release, and felt safe in purchasing it on the day of release. It honestly has not left the CD player in my car since.<br />Highlights: Unbelievers, Step, Diane Young, Hudson

1416596585|5.0|Steven Levy's In The Plex does a fantastic job of describing the history of Google and how it runs. It starts with Google's inception by Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford, and continues up until more recent events in China. The motives behind Page and Brin's actions are explained in detail. The information is very comprehensive, and describes many of Google's philosophies. It really provides insight into the decisions made by the company, in addition to how it operated from the beginning and continues to operate today. It is easy for even those not technically inclined to read, and explains both the technical and business side of Google. The book describes many of the major differences between Google and other businesses, including its employee structure and culture. Unfortunately, comparisons to other specific technology corporations are few and far between, in addition to context on Google's actions. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels that they would be interested in learning more about Google.

B000084HAJ|5.0|I still have this on LaserDisc, but the DVD is so much more convenient. I get a big kick out of the long-haried theorbo player who looks like he would be right at home in a rock band. He really gets into it. Anyone into early baroque music should have this in his collection.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia Day.  Disappointed In You.  Returned it. I guess I forgot that, to some people, \\"trilogy\\" means 5 books...  In addition to the lack of ENDING, the story and the writing went south for me in this book.  I wasted my time and feel like the author took advantage of her readers.  I will not be purchasing any further books by Sylvia Day.  Sorry to say Sylvia, you lost a reader.  Just a few days before the really late in coming release of Entwined With You, I was giving rave reviews of the first 2 books to friends.  I had to go back to those friends and tell them not to waste their money or time on starting the \\"trilogy\\" I had originally recommended.  I really wanted to love the final chapter of the saga and the ending.  Now, I don't care about either.  Especially because neither is likely to happen for 2+ more years.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's like the movie but you fight and have missions. Love it! You can earn new suites I love the movie too.

B008IJTFYW|1.0|Banner ads attempt to install bad software. Risky to phone. Find another app for the job. This one is highly suspect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazing because it challenges your reflexs and it is a lot of fun with it.You can go on Facebook and play with your friends to get more coins. Downloading the game was the best thing I have ever done!!!!!!!!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I didn't think I could ever replace my fan as that perfect white noise to sleep with, but this is amazing.  Most white noise machines are too artificial sounding for my brain and ears to sleep by.  With this app you can create a custom sound mixing from numerous sounds and volumes to get just the right sound.  I am about to travel overseas and needed to find some small solution to my nighttime white noise and this app plays on my kindle all night. There is even a custom timer for when I need it to turn off for waking.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book can't be rated because it's just that awesome. This book is an awesome emotional roller coaster ride and I loved it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Really. It's been a long time. Certainly some words have been wasted in this series, but the last three books have ended things brilliantly.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Addictive series ! Love all of the books the best so far, very romantic, sexy, heartfelt, but with a twisted ending!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is unique since it was written by a Neurosurgeon's experience while being in a coma from which he was not expected to recover.  Being a scientist he did not believe in after life so his narrative is very interesting and has a lot of scientific  knowledge of the human brain.  I could not stop reading it and think is the best book of this kind ever written.
0425263924|1.0|I don't usually write reviews but I felt I needed to.  Waited more than 6 months for this third and supposedly finale to Gideon & Eva's story.  Seriously WTF!<br /><br />I read this for Gideon & Eva's story, not Cary's or her parents' or his ex-fiancee's or even her company receptionist's!  Instead, I got a merry-go-round story about their relationship that established nothing that I don't already know from the 2nd book.<br /><br />Seriously Ms Day, I think you have lousy publishers who have given terrible advice & consultation.  You should have just ended this series on a good note, and then write another trilogy on Cary, another on her parents and another on her colleague and so on! You'll make more money that way than this!  Now you've pissed off your fans, as seen by these reviews

B0085MK2KS|2.0|Gould reduces Mozart sonatas to contrapuntal Bach; beautifully delicate lines into redacted snippets. The concerto is way too slow. The liner notes say it all, supposedly in his defense. OK. I get it. But the joke's on anyone who thinks they're getting anything to do with Mozart.

125000098X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer does epic family/history stories like no one else. Once again, in this third of how many books in the Barrington/Clifton series is remarkable and engaging. I find Archer is still as good at combining historic fact with characterized fiction as he was when he wrote Cain and Abel so many years ago. If it's a formula, then good for him because each book carries me away back in time for the hours it takes to finish the book. The characters change over the series but a little slower than, say Ken Folletts or James Michener's. We spend time with each Barrington and Clifton and it's only now that we see the future will likely revolve more around the next generation than the one that has held us for two previous books
B00BEXB18M|4.0|First of all , Dave's what? 53 years old. Sure he's mellowed, but this album rocks. I think Peace Sells.... and RIP.... and So Far.... are great albums, BUT they do sound dated. So, pining for an earlier era just doesn't make sense. This album sounds like it was recorded in 2012-2013. Dave has done a nice job here. I just listened to the disc twice in a row; I never do that. This is a nice rock album to BOB (not bang) your head to. I'm getting older myself, this is catchy hard rock, but not cheesy at all. Whether you like a Megadeth release or not, these guys are ALWAYS genuine, and I very much appreciate all of their art. Some I just listen to more often than others .  Give this one a try. To me it is a KICKASS album. Maybe two songs drag a bit and I do agree that some choruses repeat one too many times. There's a few cool breakdowns. The songs are very different from one another, so it never gets boring.I like the effect of the simpler and lower-end rhythm guitar parts, it creates a nice &#34;driving&#34; effect.   Edit:     two years later and I'm reading my review over. I apologize for referring to Rust in Peace and Peace Sells as &#34;dated.&#34;    I actually think they stand up very well today, and sound fresh.   Can't wait for DYSTOPIA to be released next week----- some early reviews are saying it is almost as good as ENDGAME. Let's hope.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! I couldn't put it down. There were many times I thought I knew where the story was going and then, zip, it went in a different direction. When I finished it I felt like I lost my best friend. Buy it, you won't regret it.

1451648537|5.0|Excellent book about a visionary technical genius of our time.  Steve Job's relentless pursuit of developing \\"seamless integration of hardware and software\\" formula in Apple products is very well narrated in this book. Consider the following axioms: \\"focus\\",\\"don't compromise\\", \\"the journey is the reward\\", \\"form follows emotion\\", \\"less is more\\", \\"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\", \\"real artists simplify\\", \\"embrace uncertainty\\" or \\"deep collaboration and concurrent engineering\\" and more. Any engineer or student or businessman or any person with a curious mind will greatly benefit from this book. It is sad that Steve Jobs died young in Oct 2011 at 56.
0425263924|5.0|I was super excited about this book coming out.  I have been waiting on it since I finished Reflected in You.  I love Gideon and Eva!  I love that they are both broken and are helping each other with their issues.  I know everyone is all yapping about the books being stretched out and all that but if anyone took the time to check Sylvia's FaceBook page or website you would see that she had nothing to do with the release date being pushed back.  If you don't want to pay $10 for the book then don't.  You don't HAVE to read it!  And maybe what started as a trilogy turned into a 5 book series.  Oh well!  I will be happy to continue reading about two of my favorite characters.  I will say that I really don't want to wait over a year to finish reading this series!<br /><br />I loved everything that happened in the book with the exception of Brett and how Eva reacts to him.  I feel like it set it up for her to really mess up and if that happens then she definitely doesn't deserve Gideon.  She shouldn't even be tempted!  I felt like if Brett were to push the issue which I think is the direction the 4th book will start out with that Eva will temporarily \\"lose herself\\" and cheat.  That is BS and I really hope I am wrong about it happening.  I really thought this book was going to be more about Gideon's demons and what exactly happened to him but I don't think I ever got a clear picture as to what happened.  With Eva it was all laid out there but he made comments about how he wasn't forced but was made sure he couldn't resist.<br /><br />I am excited to see what happens next!  I just hope I am not waiting another year to read the next installment!
B00AYJCEYC|3.0|have always liked Michael and was hoping this new album would have new songs by him not him singing everyone else's songs yet again!
1400079144|5.0|This book blew me away.<br /><br />I've done a lot of reading, from Milton<br />and Shakespeare to the Vedas and the Bible.  I'm familiar with symbology<br /> and quite a few esoteric religions.  Being a screenwriter, I also know<br />good writing from bad, and strong storytelling from weak.<br /><br />Dan<br />Brown's latest book is stellar.  The critics love to pick at his style,<br />but frankly I don't think their comments are relevant.  This book sucked<br /> me in and held me until the last word.  The writing is compelling; the<br />story is motivating; the mysticism is fascinating; and the puzzles are<br />downright genius.<br /><br />Way to go Dan Brown.  Keep 'em coming!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Let me start out by saying that if you are reading this review, I am assuming you have read the previous two books in this series and know what we have just been through in \\"Reflected in You\\". I also will admit I adore Gideon and Eva. They are both damaged yet together they are finding their healing, and building a functional relationship the best way they know how.<br /><br />I spent most of RIY cursing Gideon. Oh, Eva incurred my wrath a time or two, but in regard to Gideon, for a young man who was a billionaire at such a young age, I was expecting brilliance, not relationship cluelessness. Ultimately I got that there was a learning curve for a man who did not do relationships but who was suddenly eager to be in one.<br /><br />\\"Day One of my life was the day I met you.\\"<br /><br />Then in the end it all came together, all made sense, and while I felt he had tons of explaining to do, I understood the choices he made. His love for Eva and his fear for her safety consumed him. I loved the journey in RIY, and had big expectations for this one. I will put it out there: Sylvia Day did not disappoint. I loved every single moment of this one.<br /><br />\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"<br /><br />EWY opens up almost exactly where we left off. Eva has just left the hallway after talking to Gideon about her run-in with the detective regarding the murder case. Once again, I am drawn back into the story. Sylvia paints such a vivid picture of the sights and sounds around her that I feel like I am with Eva during her cab ride home, and continue to be right there with her throughout the whole book.<br /><br />Watching these characters grow has been such an emotionally satisfying experience. While Eva and Gideon's love for each other has never faltered, the way they deal with their relationship certainly has evolved. They talk out their problems. Dealing with situations together, trusting one another and developing together-- the progression of both of their characters is beautiful. I like that Eva is a strong heroine. She gives it to you straight. She's not afraid to have an opinion, and she really brings out the best in Gideon. I also really enjoy the detail given to all of the sub characters, too. As much as I want Eva and Gideon to find their happiness, I also find myself invested in almost every other character that has been introduced in this series.<br /><br />Tons of \\"stuff\\" happens in this installment. Some of our BIG questions are answered, while others still remain out there, and even more are added onto the pile. Eva and Gideon continue to be passionate and intense. They are far from perfect, but somehow when they are together it is perfection. Gideon continues to make women around the world swoon. For a self-professed non-romantic, he certainly has fooled me.<br /><br />\\"I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Day's writing captures the reader, and I was enthralled, reading straight through while missing a ton of sleep, but it was well worth it. I have fallen deeper in love with Gideon and Eva and look forward to them continuing to fight for themselves and their love.<br /><br />\\"You own me Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />I would feel amiss if I failed to mention some of the reviews I have been reading on this one. First and foremost, I am happy this series is going to be five books. Gideon and Eva have a ton of issues. Serious issues, that is. They have both survived very traumatic circumstances. They cannot be swept under the rug, or dealt with in a page or two. They are on a journey of discovery and healing, and that just cannot be rushed. As far as the ending goes, while I did want more, I would not ever say it was a cliffhanger. Finally, I also was frustrated with the delays of this book. However I think that Ms. Day is bearing the brunt for something over which she has little control. These books are published by Penguin, and they set release dates so send your complaints to them. I am anxious for book four and another Gideon fix.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love the hip, new take on the old star trek! Exciting, funny, clever! Love this movie! Even if you're  not a star trek fan, I would recommend giving this movie a chance. You might be surprised!
1847940676|5.0|Always the visionary, Anderson uses real-life examples and stories to show how technologies continue to evolve and change various aspects of our lives; in this case having ideas and bringing them to life through increasing access to manufacturing.
B000002GFC|5.0|I loved the band Cream in the late 60s. But I had forgotten just what made their sound so identifiable and appealing: the virtuoso guitar work of Eric Clapton and the drum work of Ginger Baker.<br /><br />Their best songs are here, and for anyone who knew them then, it's an immediate turn-back to what the late 60s felt like. For me that was a ride into nostalgia. Don't know if younger listeners will be able to identify as much w the tripped-out dynamics of songs like &#34;Strange Brew,&#34; but it's worth the experience to try it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I haven't played for very long, but it is pretty fun. It actually is rather realistic looking, except for certain parts of the horses faces.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Although I do not normally enjoy books about war, Follett makes this one extremely entertaining! Can't wait to read the second one!!
B003FL4O9E|4.0|I LOVED this movie when I was a kid so it was great to get to share it with my son. He was definitely into it though the graphics and action can't compare to the movies now a days. Still worth a watch though if you haven't taken a trip down memory lane in a while.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|With a Scottish setting, stunning visuals and a stirring soundtrack this movie promises much and things get off to a splendid start... but then the writers bring in that ridiculous spell which turns Merida's mother into a... bear?!?! This is where the movie starts losing the plot. I couldn't believe my eyes. From this point on I would sit there shaking my head - what on earth were the writers thinking??<br /><br />Merida's mother was a strong character who exuded regal charisma. What possessed the writers to turn her into a bear?? Her bear mannerisms and Merida's interaction with her... good grief. It was such a waste of a pivotal character. If that wasn't enough Merida's three little brothers turn into bears as well!<br /><br />Merida's character came across as a little bratty at times but not to the extent, in my opinion, that other reviewers have made it out to be. I personally liked her character a lot: spirited, strong, independent, yet with plenty of heart. In saying that however some of her dialogue towards her mother was over the top and totally uncalled for (eg 'You're a beast. I'd rather die than be like you!'). Gotta love that big mane of red hair though.<br /><br />'Brave' certainly does have plenty of strong scenes (my absolute favorite being the one accompanied by the song 'Touch The Sky' - this scene gives me goosebumps every time I re-watch it) but the whole 'bear spell' storyline was just plain stupid.<br /><br />I was hoping that 'Brave' was going to be more grounded in some sense of reality and history, as to opposed the over-worn hocus pocus themes that seem to permeate animations. And how Merida's use of a spell to change her mother is to be considered brave is beyond me. I do re-watch the movie to purely enjoy the Scottish setting - however very rarely will I watch beyond the bear transformation scene (about 38 minutes into the story) - the movie seriously loses the plot from that moment on and is painful to watch, especially when up to that point it's terrific viewing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was well made, however it easily had the potential to have been so much more, had it not been for the ridiculous 'bear spell' storyline. I just hope the writers are brave enough to admit that they dropped the ball here with that idea and will seek to make amends for any sequels.
B000EWBKKI|1.0|Movie is great but the BD disc failed after 5 years.  Had bought this as an archival movie (along with T1 & T3 and several other Schwartzenegger action flicks) due to the low price, played it a few times and kept it in a cabinet along with all my other BD movies.  However when I tried watching it again with some friends a month ago, it refused to load in 3 different BD players.  Disc is in excellent shape - no scratches, dirt etc - so I'm guessing it got 'disc rot' although I cannot see any difference between it and the other Terminator BD discs.  What a rip!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I was happy when they came out with this for the amazon app store. Some levels are tough. Enjoy people...!!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Yeah, the characters and plot are cliched and over the top. Yeah, it's full of absurdly cool high tech gadgets. But it's so much fun to watch this wild action film, I really don't care. And watch is the key word, both Cruise and Patton are striking. It is cool to watch a woman kicking butt. The chases, fights and special effects are engaging. At one point I even gasped. I've seen a few reviews here that complain that the movie is \\"unrealistic\\", well, that's pretty much the point.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Best book series  ever  written keep making them they are hilarious and I have read them all in the series
B004RKXHZY|3.0|Let me just say that I teach Literature in a middle school and I felt able to wholeheartedly endorse the first novel in this series, Anna and the French Kiss. In spite of its suggestive title, Anna is actually a girl with a good head on her shoulders who doesn't let herself be pushed into adult situations that she is not ready for. This book did not glamorize the sexual behavior of its characters, but matter-of-factly showed some of the negatives related to the choices they made and how those relationships may not last forever.  In spite of its much more wholesome title, Lola and the Boy Next Door immediately plunges the reader in the web of lies Lola has created to hide her relationship with the much older Max, with whom she is having sex (hello-statuatory rape?)even though she doesn't really enjoy it.  Lola wants to be different and stand out, so to accomplish that she constantly pushes conventions from her wardrobe to her love life.  She lies to everyone, even her lovable best friend Lindsey, and most importantly, to herself. Girls like Lola certainly exist-I have known a few of them. However, this book consistently challenges conventions at a level that many of my students did not enjoy.  They were very disappointed in the flawed Lola versus the straightforward and good-hearted Anna of the first book. The students who enjoy reading edgy, out-there books really liked this, but it is not for the majority of 12-14 year olds.  Lola's pursuit of a life of lies and deceit are excused by the author because Cricket had broken her heart.  I don't feel that is a good message to send to younger readers and they also may not be mature enough to realize the inappropriateness of her relationship with Max.  Lola is not someone to look up to, but rather someone to be pitied for her poor choices. Although Lola does come to realize that what she wants is not the road she has been traveling, be aware that while more \\"mature\\" issues were a side-note in \\"Anna\\", they are the storyline in this book. I hope Isla and Josh don't let me down in the next book.  This was not quite what I had hoped for.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an amazing book. It takes the reader to the heart of the War on Terror, and what it was like for Navy SEAL Kris Kyle.<br /><br />I am a Marine who joined in '09, so I heard some stories from people who were in the area that he operated out of and some from a MARSOC guy who trained with him and some of the other SEALs. Some people may not understand the hate that he had for Muslims, but they weren't there. Didn't go through what he did. I am not saying I did, but I have a similar mindset when it comes to them.<br /><br />He is the kind of Hero that kids need to idolize, not movie stars, rappers or singers. He stood for what he believed in and refused to back down from his ideals.<br /><br />People have said that he was a killer, he was and we need more like him. People who will kill so that others never have to. He made up part of the wall that keeps this country safe.<br /><br />He was and always will be an American Hero. Rest in peace Kyle you earned it.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|Nice cover for the price. The tablet fits well and is secure. The cover has quality appearance and feel. The only thing i would add is a place to secure a stylus in the binder which there is plenty of room. I would recommend this product to others.
B0027REDN4|5.0|Did you see what I did there!? Okay seriously. When Death Comes is the best album of 2009. This album is what B.A.C.K should have been. Full of power, energy, and attitude. In my opinion, B.A.C.K wasn't necessarily bad...it was just bad for Artillery. If that makes sense. I mean they had one of the most melodic frontmen to grace the thrash world in Flemming Ronsdorf. Much like Canada's Razor, their frontman was gone after a lengthy career but the band found a new injection for metal with a new lead singer. In all cases, this happened here. The title track is full of great riffs. The intro is great. Another positive aspect about this album is the production. This is how thrash should sound. Especially modern thrash, instead of over compressed drum tracks and repetitive riffs...Artillery has always been ahead of the average and one of the leaders of the elites. Their riffs never get old.<br /><br />Positives: Production is clean. Drum tracks aren't overpowering, in fact, the Stutzers play so well with the new singer. Carsten Nielson is back on drums just like the old days!!<br /><br />Some possible problems for old school fellas: The new singer isn't Ronsdorf in his prime, but he is better than Ronsdorf from B.A.C.K. Some riffs and ideas seem to bring you back to By Inheritance (to me that's a great thing) Example: Delusions Of Grandeur makes me thing of \\"Don't Believe\\" every time. More emphasis was put on melody than straight out thrash (the thrash is there) its just much more melodic.<br /><br />OVERALL: In my honest opinion, this album is full of nothing but perfect metal tracks. Its much better than B.A.C.K. It holds the past to the legendary status but it also shows Artillery is focused on the future. This is possibly the best metal album of 2009 with Megadeth's \\"Endgame\\" being its only competition. This is a must have.
0425263924|5.0|This book ends at a good point - Gideon and Eva commit to each other.  For those who don't want a fourth volume - you can just quit and assume that they live happily ever after.  Cary remains Cary and I don't understand anger at the developments in his story.  He remains an attractive character who is doing his best.  I've read the book twice already and will purchase the next books in the series.<br /><br />There are a lot of unresolved issues from these three books which need to be resolved.  I am glad that the story will continue.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book really sucked<br />This book wss the most awful piece of crap i jave ever read in my liffffeeeeee¡¡¡¡¡!!!!!
0143119680|5.0|Great book. Loved the settings and the characters. I recommended it to a friend, who downloaded it for her e reader. She loved it too and quickly downloaded the second in the seriers (Shadow of Night). I haven't started the second yet myself as I'm finishing another book before I start a new one.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great set of blue ray videos.  All my favorite movies and a couple extra that I have not seen. Very Pleased
B004ZNACA6|5.0|A nice package and the music is great. I have been a fan for years and it is nice to have it all in one package.
B001G8XON0|5.0|I ordered this movie as a Christmas gift for my brother cause I couldn't find it anywhere! I was really impressed about how fast it actually got here. It was supposed to arrive a couple days AFTER Christmas, but it ended up arriving on Christmas eve. Plus, the movie was pretty cheap for being a blu ray. I love it though and so does he. It made for a great gift.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|At first thinking about a Green Arrow show I was a bit skeptical, but then I watched it and it is AMAZING. Very well done show that anyone could enjoy whether you are longtime fan or an outsider. Great Action and suspense with a very well-knit story and cast.
B002RI91IU|3.0|Good writing as one would expect with Auster, but sometimes the work just does not sparkle enough. I do admire the writing, but not his tone.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Even though , its listed in with the dirctors cut , the Blu Ray , isnt it . Amazon lists it along with its pricing . I had bought the BluRay already  an thought it had the added minutes ,,NOT ! Still a great movie in whatever format , its one of the last  great westerns of the 20th century . Awesome cast good Director , cant beat that ! Val Kilmar gives a super performance as Doc Holiday an thats worth the price of the DVD .
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome but my friend Seth has 7.0 and I have 6.1 maby because he has iphone and I have kindal
B00821OX98|5.0|Quality was really good. Executive Producer Spielberg captures and draws in your attention in every episode. Special effects are very well done. Audio and visuals work just fine.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was a very surprising book. Plus mysterious. I loved it. I think it would be great for anyone over 10 years old.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very well done. You see the evolution of one of the greatest bands in history.<br />I loved every minute. Enjoyable.
B005LAII80|5.0|Even though I read many comics in my youth, I had only limited opportunity to check out the Dredd series. I very much enjoyed the few that I could find. The stories were interesting and clever, and I thought it was cool that you never saw Dredd's face. Anyway, like I said in my title, they did everything right with this film. Very gritty action, Karl Urban's Dredd is GREAT, Olivia Thirlby is also terrific as the rookie Anderson and Lena Headey is truly scary as the brutal Ma-Ma. The look of the film is rough but highly detailed and surprisingly colorful. There is some extreme violence in slo-mo and some quick flashes of sexual violence, so this is definitely an R-rated movie. There are some good special features that fill you in a little bit as far as what the Dredd character and society is all about. I understand the film didn't do especially well at the box office which is too bad. It was very well done and Dredd's stories should definitely be continued in (many) sequels.
030758836X|5.0|To be honest, I think this is in my top 10 books of all time, and I read A LOT. The only criticism i have (which isn't really a criticism) is that there is a little trouble connecting with the characters, so you don't know who to root for. Loved it nonetheless.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I sat down to read this after reading some of the negative reviews - so my expectations weren't high which is why I wasnt SOO disappointed. Everyone knows what is going on here - filler and fluff to extend the series....  I would happily buy all 5 books for $10 each if the books were good but Crossfire 3 was just.....  Idk - nothing?  It's like I read a whole book and nothing really happened.  Sure they got married, but it was so anti-climatic and just........ Filler.  Clearly the series could have been finished in this book.  I would have cut out 80 percent of this book!  Just wasn't interesting and probably won't buy the 4/5 books if they are going to be as bad....  Expected more out of Sylvia since she really is a talented writer.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Truly Boring!!!  If  you are looking for more of a storyline than two self-absorbed self-professing love-at-first sight goofs than this is not the book for you.  Completely unrealistic in all the premises.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Still can't believe I got this free a couple of years ago.  Love the prediction. Swiping made it that much better.
1781162646|5.0|I just finished the novel and I'm hoping I can express my feelings on a spur of the moment review. I'm not going to hold you in suspense here, I'm going to come out and say it paragraph one. Joyland is one of the best things King has written in years. I've been a fan of his writing for a long time, and as many of his fans can tell you, there's something magic about his early novels. He may have developed into a better wordsmith (or perhaps he would prefer the term \\"wordslinger\\") as years went on, but there's something about his older stories. Maybe it was the time and place, but the stories of the 70s showed a time when his imagination ran wild. Joyland may be written now, in the 2010s, but it is very much a piece of the 70s.<br /><br />The plot follows Devin Jones, a heartbroken college student getting away from the world and taking a job in a little theme park called Joyland. The summer of 73 Devin will tell you was one of the most beautiful and also probably his saddest, and King makes you feel both of those. Devin's a jack of all-trades in Joyland, sometimes he works the rides, other times he's forced to \\"wear the fur,\\" and during that time he learns the lingo of the carnival, The Talk as it's called. I don't know how much of the Talk King made up, and how much he discovered in his research, but it's a joy to read and really places you in Devin's world.<br /><br />But this isn't you're standard King story. As you can see it's published by Hard Case Crime, which means there's something of a detective story. Well yes there is. It's introduced early on as something of a ghost story, about the Haunted House ride really being haunted by a woman who was killed there years ago... and the mystery develops as the plot does.<br /><br />The supernatural and the mystery aspects, while a strong focus in the novel, are not really what this is about. While this book is certainly more \\"hard crime\\" than King's previous entry to the publisher (2005's The Colorado Kid) this one isat least more of a traditional mystery in terms of plot progression (No real spoilers, but I think it's safe to say I'm not the only reader who was annoyed by Kid's ending). This book is really more of a character drama though. We follow Devin's summer and then autumn and we watch him grow up. From the downward spiral he begins at, through those little magic moments that he claims he will never forget. Some of those moments are truly wonders to read. King turns what could be a rather boring moment of Devin wearing a dog costume and entertaining children into one of the best moments I've read all year. Devin states at one point that it's his last summer as a child, and by the end of the book you see him emerge that autumn as an adult. We go through it with him, and I know I felt for him before it was all over.<br /><br />In conclusion: This book may never go down as one of King's masterpieces, simply because he's even started off its publication treating it like a pulp novel... and that's a real shame. This is King at a high point, looking back over his career and telling a short but thrilling story. He managers to capture minds (and yes, I'll be cheesy and even add hearts there) with a story that shows his talents. I'm happy to give this one a full five stars and suggest it to anyone and everyone who may be even slightly interested. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.<br /><br />Note: I've read a lot of people are upset that this isn't published in Kindle format. I'll not get into a hardcopy/digital debate, but one of the big problems people state is that they're worried the print will be too small (a problem I'll be the first to agree that many of King's paperback book have). Worry not about that. I would say in terms of print, the font size and spacing is about the same as my kindle. There are more words on the page (I have a kindle touch, so this may not be the case for everyone) but font is perfectly readable.
B00008L3U1|4.0|This is a great family movie!  I highly recommend it to teach all ages of kids about the beauty of being different!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the same story as 50 shades of Grey but the writing seemed better.  Power players playing each other and having a good time at it.  Hot scenes.

B00991TCOG|5.0|This CD is wonderful. Lindsey is such a talent and her music has a style all it's own. I find this CD lifts my spirits when I need a lift. It's just...fun ! Totally enjoyable...and if you haven't watched her videos...do so!!! They are amazing!!
0307477401|5.0|His usual great attention to detail. He knows current political events and without taking a personal position he weaves them into his stories. He is one of the great masters of telling stories that keep you curious to the very end. His character, Kurt Wallander , is human like so many of us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!!! Everything from the scenery, the time period, the British accents and the acting make this series superb!!! Highly recommend.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I enjoy this game. It's a good way to pass the time. It's worth it to buy and play it.
B003O86MY8|5.0|For those who love David...and rock..this is for you. He never disappoints..this one too is a must for your collection!!
B008JJM88Q|3.0|This app force closes a lot. It works about three times a day and then it will not work for the rest of the day. It constantly gives an error alert message. As fun as this app is, be careful with having it on your device.<br /><br />When he can't guess who you are thinking of, then he wants to know the name. Well, ok, I can do that, however, there is no submit button. So how do I give him the name?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What an incredible book! This was so interesting it grabbed my attention from the beginning and I did not want to put the book down. Dr. Eben Alexander tells of his journey of seeing heaven during his seven days in a coma. I grew up believing that your soul goes to a better place when you die but, to be honest, death was still a little scary to think about. After reading this book it makes me feel better knowing that this is a wonderful place where we will spend eternity. Things do happen for a reason and I believe Dr. Alexander was taken on this journey and brought back so he could tell his story to all of us, skeptics and believers alike. There is no science to back up how this could have happened to Dr. Alexander, so it is harder to refute that God exists! Even Dr. Alexander will tell you in his book he didn't believe there was a God anymore before this event. You will have a much more positive outlook on life and death after reading this book. It really puts things in perspective.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Did not love nor hate it.  It was just another run of the mill adventure with the Mr. James Bond.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|This CD exceeded my expectations and more!! I am fan of all David does but I believe this is my favorite CD of them all. Loved the song choices....to me ,it showcases his talent in all areas. This CD will not disappoint in any way...there is something for everyone!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love the real love and real emotions between Gideon and Eva!! I felt like I was there with them.  Yes, the story ended a little abruptly but it just left me wanting more! I want their love story to be happily ever after. Looking forward to the next book but I DON't WANT to wait long!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|awesome game. great for children and adults! my favorite game. great graphics and lots of fun and amazing fish,corals,and plants. I love it!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|the best movie I have ever seem would watch it over and over again.  great purchase glad I could get this movie
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story was funny and heart wrenching at the same time.  It's an easy read, but the author is very descriptive and pulls emotionally in a short space.
0425263991|5.0|Deeper, Darker more intense than any of the previous psy/changeling novels, Nalini Singh creates a story that seeps into the readers very being and holds it captive. A twisted fairytale about love that lasts but never quite escapes the darkness. This book SEETHES.. it pulses it doesn't sing to our souls it drums to our hearts. Each beat a pulses and calling us to the dance.<br /><br />From the beginning Kaleb Krychek has been an enigma, a male that captured our attention, caused us to wonder.. Is he a good guy or a bad guy, the answer was and always will be yes.. the answer is easy, it's the question that's hard. Kaleb, lives and breathes for one purpose. Up until HoO we weren't quite sure what it was. Sure we got hints but the dance Nalini took us on to get here was absolutely brilliant. This fabulously dark anti hero becomes a man with not a heart, not a conscience but a soul. Sure he has \\"reasons\\", rational ones even, for everything he does but there are constant moments when Kaleb's light just shines out of his darkness and we begin to fall ever deeper under his spell.<br /><br />Kaleb's reason for living came as a complete and total surprise to me. A character mentioned just once or twice in a past book. A single past book, I honestly missed the connection. Well that is until someone brought up her name in one of the pre release discussions I was part of. Still didn't see her as the heroine to Kaleb's darkness.. And yet Sahara was a brilliant choice (yes I know enough with the brilliance stuff) an unknown woman with a secret past.. yet with connections to some of the most powerful Psy as well as her Leopard family.<br /><br />Sahara was the perfect choice as she was a light to Kaleb's darkness and yet she was broken, fragile, tortured.. Had endured enough of the dark to understand it, to accept it and to rise above it. Kaleb would need just such a woman. One who was never really silent and yet survived silence. A brilliant mind that managed to protect itself under the harshest situations, a fragile soul that shows us looks can be deceiving. This woman was never ever fragile!! How could any survivor be considered such? And yet even I have used it describing Sahara.. why? Because it is perfect. Sahara is a contradiction in terms and she has that inner strength that only those who shine with a pure intensity can have. They overcome obstacles with an innate grace most of us lack.  They become our silent heroes, the ones who really run things. The voice behind the leaders.. Sahara has earned her place in Kaleb's world.<br /><br />In a way, HoO isolates us from the rest of the characters we so adore in the Psy/Changeling Series and yet because so much of it takes place between just the two of them, the interactions with others is more powerful, more intense and honestly more important.<br /><br />What this book does is forge connections. While fighting Pure Psy Nalini gathers her forces to fight for the entire society.. It will be interesting to see where she is going from here. I know there is so much more going on.<br /><br />A great read! Well worth the wait.<br /><br />Shauni
0240816250|4.0|Could easily be called an encyclopedia of B&W this book is very comprehensive but also has some oversights. The organisation is strange, early in the book there is a long chapter on how to decide if you should do limited edition portfolios, a problem few of us will ever have to worry about, later in the book are much more important chapters on film exposure/development and printing skills. A major omission in my opinion is the subject of proofing negs, very important thing to do and something that must be done correctly but not a mention on how to make a proper proof. I think some of the chapters will be of very limited appeal to most photogs, after all, do we really need to test batches of film and paper to make sure they are up to spec? All in all a good book but written by people that love testing and the theory of the process instead of by artists. I should mention that there a quite a few really cheesy semi nude photos.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I gotta say that no matter how many reboots Hollywood throws out they still seem to amaze me. The story of these young youths going to a creepy cabin in the woods is a sure enough classic for horror films. I loved the original \\"Evil Dead\\" films. When my friends and I saw this on in theaters my jaw literally dropped by the end of the gore fest. I was so shocked that the MPAA approved this. The level of gore was so tense I was thinking I was already watching the unrated cut. It was endless. If you love raunchy, gory, bloody horror movies, this one will fit perfectly in you collection. Be sure to own your copy on July 16th!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|In the beginning I didn't know whether or not I would like it. It was similar to another book that I had recently read. I am glad I stuck with it. I found myself rooting for the protagonist.  I didn't expect the outcome but felt it was quite apropos. I will recommend it to my my book group.
0307352153|5.0|I really appreciate the message of this book. Haven't finished it yet, but it has been helpful to me in dealing with my leadership challenges.

0425263924|4.0|Love reading abt this couple to see them evolve and work through their pasts and fight for their relationship. Was so shocked by the speed of the developement of the book but with this couple what other way would work. Look forward to the next couple of books!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I love reruns, especially when you can watch them anytime you choose, with no commercials, and it is wonderful to be able to find the movie you want.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was like everyone else waiting for the release of this book even into the late night for its release.  It did not seem to have the drama the other two books had and kind of left me feeling like it didn't follow the true flow of the other books.  I can get over being left hanging at the end but the author note kind of rubbing in my nose made me not want to read the next one.  I know we all want to make money and get that but don't rub it in the nose of the loyal followers who have been faithfully waiting.  Sorry not your best Sylvia.

0307943232|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot line.  It is total fantasy and easy to get lost in the story.  It was a little far-fetched,but enjoyable just the same.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I don't think I've been more excited for a books release than I was for Entwined with You. That being said, I was very disappointed that not much was wrapped up in this book. Once again we are left waiting to find out what happens next. I did love this book I just wish it was a conclusion not a 'to be continued'.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I am a movie afficianado - i like all kinds of movies, especially those that are educational and entertaining - this is one.
0143122916|4.0|Very engaging/informative read. Very scary & informative of what's going on in N. Korea. It's like the holocaust over there except none of the rest of the world is doing anything about...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I agree with the other readers - no closure to anything, the book just ends.  I was so looking forward to this book.  The 1st time I've ever pre-ordered a book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have to agree with the numerous other one star reviews of this book, and I think it speaks VOLUMES that over 200 one star reviews were given within the first 48 hours of the release of this new book.  The \\"ending\\" was ridiculous and VERY disappointing.  Clearly the author is interested in making money off of this versus satisfying her readers.  There is NO REASON for this to be more than a trilogy.  If she added another chapter or two to this book, that would have been sufficient to complete the story.  There is not enough of a storyline to create another two books.  There wasn't a huge storyline in this book....it was more about seeing how Gideon and Eva's relationship has transitioned into a better and deeper place (how far they've come) than in the previous book.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the incredibly descriptive sex scenes in this book, as well as the new dynamic of Gideon and Eva's relationship (which is why I won't be returning it for a refund), I can say with CERTAINTY that I will NOT be buying anymore books in this series. I have decided to make up my own ending for these two love birds.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing as always. Can't wait for the next. Keeps me reading. I couldn't put the book down. I will read more of her stuff
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would soooooo get this game me and my two brothers love it.  I cant wait for the new update
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Are you freaking kidding me!? What a liar! This series was supposed to be a trilogy.. and now she leaves us with a book that I felt was HALF of a book. Then, if you look on her website, she has decided to turn the TRILOGY into a QUINTET. Trust me.. when you read this book, you will see that it could've been wrapped up in three. She was grasping at new ideas that should be left out. At the end of book two, we hear from the detective that the case is going on the shelf and although she knows Gideon killed the SOB, she is not going to pursue it... Then this book starts with the same detectives going on about the case and a lead, blah bah blah. Again, I say WTF?<br /><br />I am so annoyed with authors lately. I know you get money from selling books, but don't try to milk us like a COW! Be true to your story and don't string them along. Jesus, first Charlaine Harris with Sookie and now Sylvia day with Crossfire. What a disappointing year for book fans.
B00004VVN9|3.0|I love movies - for this movie you really need to be in the right mood - you will need to use your brain a little.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Saw this at the movies and loved it… then I found out that it was a TV series that had only one season; and I got it and I could watch it a million times. Classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Honestly this app is a lot better than I expected because they got buckets on the Apple version on iphone/ipod  and spawn eggs so I'm done with whining ok mojang? &Ograve;_&ograve;
0446533122|2.0|The  book was not torn or badly worn but had food smears on cover and throughout the book! It looks like someone was eating a chilidog while reading it. UGH!<br />The book is great....like most all of Baldacci's books.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|the trailers for this this movie (and many others) should have been the ones to win anything (if there was something to win).
B005PK57IK|4.0|Can be a road map for other people of how to handle infidelity.BRAINS always will get you out of troublesome position.
B004H4XI5O|2.0|The title is misleading, the book doesn't really get into the details of memory techniques. It is rather a biography of the author. It is an interesting biography but I didn't have that in mind when I bought the book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not as good as the last 2 books, but still a good read. Can't believe we have to wait for the next book again. Hopefully it won't be long!
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Movies - they tell so many stories - this one is a replacement for a VHS tape - this is what quite a few of my dvd purchases are.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Totally awesome Scifi show.  Great characters and interactions.  I highly recommend it for anyone who likes witty fantasy shows and strong female leads.
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|Darius  Rucker is  making that move as a multi genre  making  artist. following the footsteps of Charlie Pride and making a Powerful  statement. glad to see a Modern Day Black Artist taking on Nashville and country music and doing his thing  period.  in doing something that  Ray Charles and  Lionel RIchie also walked these music halls.  Rucker is on the right path and doing quite well in his now his 3nd life as a  Artist.  front man for a Alternative/pop Band Hootie and the blowfish  made a solo R&B Album and now doing country and doing  quite well.  now its all about  songs and performances that take him even further.  he has no limits. this album is cool and i like the throwback  feel of it,however nothing really stands out, however  his voice is on point and the music was tight.  however his best stuff is yet to come. glad to see him breaking that glass ceiling.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Always thrilling and Harry gets darker with ever step. An bsolutely addictive read. You will not be able to lift your eyes from the book!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|always wanted this movie - it is not so great, but the history of the situation can been seen in many movies
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend and I feel like it is well constructed and can absorb phone drops with out damaging the phone. Good buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game on the xbox, and it is AWESOME!!!! But with the pocket edition, i can create amazing structures on the road. Thank u for making this game mojang!!!!!!!!!!
0765365278|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  Characters well written, and I could remember their names as the book progressed.  His style of writing makes for easy reading on a difficult topic.  I recommend this to anyone who loves Science Fiction.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Seriously?  This is not how you end a book.  I feel like I was walking down the street enjoying the journey and suddenly hit a wall.<br /><br />Eva is horrible.  If you're not interested in someone you say it straight out, you don't invite them up to your apartment even though you're in love with someone else.  She turned into a total selfish bitch.<br /><br />I don't even understand half of what's going on, its just too busy to remember who is doing what because EVERYONE in the book has some drama going on.<br /><br />So not happy with this book.<br /><br />No.  Just no.<br /><br />Really next time just end mid sentence, it'll be less irritating.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|There is nothing more to say but Perfectly wonderful.  If there is one bad thing to say about this CD it is that it makes me miss him even more.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It is a great  movie. I could watch it over and over and I got it for a great price
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far I'm enjoying this game but I'm still figuring it out. As of now my only complaint would be more personalization...i.e. rotating buildings, picking out plants and where to put them.
0425263924|4.0|I felt the first two books in the series where better, halfway through Entwined I found myself needing a little more and actually went and checked other reviews to see if anyone else felt the same.  The ending was a little lackluster but, I suspect that's due to the story continuing.  I will be reading the other books in the series when they are released. Hopefully the wait won't be too long.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We loved it  can't wait for next season I think that lady that had a baby is still alive somewhere
B0042C1BP0|4.0|A modern twist to the old story of Le Chiffre and Bond card duel but I missed the Du Pont character. Was Mathis a bad guy?
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|download mistake, game not played, deleted but it keeps coming back maybe someday i will try it but not now
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I've always been fascinated with all things Apple and Steve is one of them. He was an amazing, complex man
B00B2YH7D6|4.0|Very similar theme to Back and Forth, but I invite more of a great thing.  Dave Grohl is talented and amusing, as usual.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game but right now getting very upset. It has taken my spares from two rooms spotless therefore. I have no trades. I know I'm not elite but I worked hard to build up items spending my coins. They should give them back but wont. They also took 54 coins and haven't given back. If they do return they will get a really great review.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a really good and fun app to just waste time on and build your city one building at a time. LOVE IT!!
0920668372|5.0|WHEN I WAS LITTLE MY MOM READ THIS BOOK TO ME I READ IT TO MY LITTLE SISTER AND SHE LOVED IT AND NOW WITH A BABY BOY ON THE WAY I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF HE LIKES IT(:
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Interesting love story, with an unusual twist. Really learned about the characters, and cared about them.  Easy read, unusual premise, and I do recommend the book.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek is my new hero. An ultra runner who lives off a plant based diet. This book is filled with the great adventures of his ultra races.
0425263924|1.0|This book was a waste of my time and money. Eva and Carey are too insecure and immature and I got tired of her second guessing Gideon every five minutes.  Why the hell he stays with her baffles me. Girl needs to get a damn spine and stop being such an ass.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should upgrade the items to go with the theme theme also you should make different clothes for all the characters
B0089LOKHG|3.0|A little tougher to get into and stay with than the other two. I think it could have been better, but often for me the third in a trilogy feels forced, rushed or just drawn out depending on the author's ability to wrap it up. Disappointed. I hope that the Divergent series last book ends better!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Small battles and strategy building. Age of empires ish but with a fun for kids theme. Had a bit of fun myself.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very fun and easy but believe me it gets harder.  I like to see who can score the highest with family and friends.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've had this game on my Kindle HD for a month now and just recently it was updated. Ever since the update, my game crashes more times than I am able to get into it!!!! Could the creators please fix this?!?! I love playing this game & like the new additions, such as the Vet Clinic, but if I can't play, then what's the point?? One other thing is the amount of energy needed to chop down a tree, could this be reduced a bit or could we get more wood for each chop?? Overall, a fun game & a great way to pass the time as long as it doesn't crash!!!!! I'm giving this game 2 stars for now but when the crashing stops I'll raise my rating to 5 stars!!<br /><br />Edit.... Thank you to the creators for fixing the loading issue. However, now we are unable to connect with our friends farms & the \\"Nearby\\" farm. It says that there is a connection issue but the connection is apparently still good enough for the creators to advertise other games and to sell the Trail \\"Bucks\\" (REAL money). I was going to change my rating to a higher one once they fixed the loading issue but now I am waiting until they can get us connected back to our friends cities! We need the items we receive in these cities to get past goals and Upgrade our buildings. Once this issue is fixed, I will be raising my rating but until then, this game while fun, is still at 2 stars.<br />****Second Edit to my Review.....<br />Ok, yesterday an update when through for this app. Now we are unable to load the game because it tells you that a new update is available and to go to the App Store to get it. However, we already have the update. I have notified Amazon & for all of you who are already playing this game, Gameloft is aware of the issue & are working to fix it. It should be ready in a day or two according to Amazon Customer Support. I personally think that Gameloft should have done a test run on their own Kindles to check if the update worked but what do I know, I'm only a PAYING customer (yes, I'm one of those that have actually spent real money on this app). Hopefully the game will be fixed ASAP!!!!! I will update my Review when they fix the app but right now, I'd give it a minus 1 star if that were possible.ve actually spent real money on this app). Hopefully the game will be fixed ASAP!!!!! I will update my Review when they fix the app but right now, I'd give it a minus 1 star if that were possible.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series! I thought it was a trilogy to find out at the end of this book that there will be another or others. I am both disappointed and happy. I don't know if I can wait a year to find out what happens next!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's been fun so far, but it's looking like a lot of other games where you eventually either have to buy stuff or get a bunch of friends to start playing.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Keeps you updated on your emails at anytime straight to your kindle.  Can check your email as soon as you get alert on your kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the graphics are great the game is fast paced you need quick reflexes to play .  every one should have this game
B0087WRGVY|4.0|Eclipse have returned to the world stage with their brand new record &#34;Bleed & Scream,&#34; and man does this baby smoke. Erik Martensson is seemingly everywhere these days with the melodic rock scene, from writing and producing, to rocking out with W.E.T. and Eclipse. It's easy to imagine that this guy would soon run out of quality material with all his irons in the fire, but rest assured, this album is terrific.<br /><br />Eclipse basically take the '80s  rock sound and production and effectively meld it to form their own unique sound. The song writing and  production &#34;Bleed & Scream&#34; is simply over-the-top and luscious, and their musicianship and concentration seem more focused than their previous album. The biggest treat, to me, is the killer vocals that Martensson delivers on this record. His singing is incredibly easy on the ears and well suited to this style of music, and one can imagine him fitting in quite nicely on the Sunset Strip back in the day. My favorite tracks from the album are....well every single one of course! &#34; The album is strong and cohesive, and it's impossible to think any melodic rock fan wouldn't enjoy this record.<br /><br />If you like what Erik Martensson does with W.E.T., or any other of his projects, then you'll undoubtedly enjoy this as well. This is easily one of the better releases from the year so far, and I always look forward another Eclipse release.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Saw it in theatres and was blown away. Haven't seen a true horror movie in a loooooong time! Plenty of scary moments & gallons of gore lol. Kinda sucks there's no Unrated cut included but hey, can't have everything I guess. All in All, great horror flick!
B00ATU5JRA|2.0|Mr sure why seemed like it would but it didn't hope it does for others give it a try ok
B00CH87HF4|4.0|great game to get lost in, not very much lag for how detailed it is ive ran in to a few items that wont let me upgrade but that seems to be. the only bug ive ran into
B00271DNP4|5.0|Being a great Harry Potter fan, I can only say that I love ALL the movies and give them all high marks.
B000IONJH4|5.0|Cult Sci-Fi movie that I think was made before it time. good story line, good special effects and good casting.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Reminded me of old Mario games.  Was very enjoyable and easy to use.  Any age group would enjoy this game.
B000P2A256|4.0|Love most of the songs. :-)  they arrived in a good time. :-)  and I only had problems listening to songs after I purchased the CDs. But now that there here. Its no problem :-)
B002RVCD6O|5.0|What can I say?  Another winner!  There will never be another Harry Potter (or another Dumbledore).  This movie is a turning point in the saga.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like this game a lot.  Would give it 5 stars if it didn't take real money to advance in the game.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I enjoyed it all the way through from start to end!  Had to stay attentive bc f it being timed made you push yourself but not to hard perfect.
0425263991|2.0|I had really looked forward to this book, but I found it disjointed and not much of the Changeling world in the story. This was pure Psy story and I really missed the Changeling's in this book. Sahara's stay in the Changeling's world was very short to say the least and Kaleb kept transporting her out of what was supposed to be a \\"safe\\" place for her. I think she was in her tree house for about an hour and spent the rest of her time at Kaleb's.  The book was somewhat of a disappointment for me.  I'd recommend getting the book from the library, but then I might be in the minoirity here. The story fell flat for me. I'm looking forward to Nalini getting back to the Changeling world.  But again, that is just my opinion.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This film is a masterpiece. You enjoy it over and over even if you see it multiple times in one day.

B003K1EYM6|2.0|I could not get pictures to download onto my IPad.  Not sure if it is me or the IPad or something else.  Will have to get someone else to help me make sure it will work on my IPad.  Hopefully it is just me not understanding the process.  Will know more in a few days.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I knew it couldn't really be the last book!!!!  OMG!!!!  The suspense is going to be a killer....when is the next book coming out?????
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Wonderful game.  Funny music, graphics, creatures. Challangable levels. Different creatures with different powers. I like it so much. You have to try it.
B00BXLU1EU|2.0|I thought it would help me pick up a WiFi network but it was just a toy s it was k for a gag

B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a great game only thing is it isnt update or I would give it 5 stars so when u add the update I'll give u 5
B0087JTAKW|5.0|So very different from Mitch Albom's other books but just as enjoyable. Intriguing. Thought provoking. A book for all times.
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|Recipe books and such just don't seem to work for me on Kindle. Would rather have the book to flip through. But the content is very useful and informative.
0425263924|1.0|The ending sucked what was the point of this book? Sylvia this book was just plain bad!!!! I just waisted my money and that makes me mad. and you made us wait all those months for nothing I won't be buying the rest of this series.
B0000004V2|4.0|In 1989 I was a teenager and only interested in Heavy Metal music.  I'm glad that I can now appreciate this classic recording almost 25 years later.  I read that a few British music magazines have recently called this the greatest British recording of all time.  If this is true, I feel that they may be a little biased by the fact that this album was a part a scene that later spawned Brit-pop.  Good guitar rock.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Good sounds  &amp; pictures.  Had to buy full version @ $4'99  not too challenging though.  Fun to play and see.  Some good scary voices
B001NLL93W|5.0|Torn between love and hate, good and bad this book will keep you wishing that it will never have to end.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book.  I don't know why there are so many bad reviews??  I love that there was more depth to other characters and Gideon's story is getting bigger and bigger!!!  I love that they are secretly together...so exciting.<br /><br />The only bad thing...now we have to WAIT for another book.  PLEASE SYLVIA...HURRY UP!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Collecting old sci-fi movies these are movies i saw as a kid.  I love watching this and remembering my childhood days.
1600595871|4.0|I am glad that I have added this book to my collection of books on book binding and construction of handmade books.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game, i would say, is kinda like a maze on some of the levels. It is very much like cut the rope. As i said, soooooooooooo addicting!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has so many sounds to choose from.  I also like that you can customize the sounds to create your own mix.
B00280LYIM|5.0|a really thrilling book thatll want to make you keep reading. it kept me awake all night long so its really good
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I waited almost a year to read this book which by the way.. was supposed to be the last one!!!! this series was a trilogy !!! Wtf just happened I'm so pissed right now!!! Don't get me wrong Sylvia still rocks !!!!. But it's not right!! I just really hope I don't have to wait so long for what I hope is the last one!!!  S*** I'm  pissed !!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So my first review. I'll keep it short and sweet. I love love loved the first two. Sylvia day wow what a writer. But she let me down this one. Trying not to sound too harsh, it was boring and I'm not talking about the love-making. The plot just seemed so lifeless like she couldn't think of anything juicy. Don't get me wrong I love the series and I would recommend it as a whole, and I will be back for more, It just didn't have me on the edge of my seat.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is a great easy read. Uplifting and inspiring. It comes my hope cup and strengthen my faith. This is a great place to start exploring who God is and how God makes self known.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am joining the masses in complaining about the ending. Overall, the story is good. But it was sad that after spending $10 and waiting so long for the story to conclude, the author throws in a delayed ending. Though I enjoy the characters and general story line and don't want that to end, the author clearly had alternative reasons for drawing this out. Really, really disappointed.
0385349947|5.0|This newest summary of women's progress in the work world and at home contains relevant data as well as personal anecdotes--funny, inspiring, and motivating to both women and men of all ages.  It should be required reading for all business degrees!  And what a wonderful graduation gift for any woman!!
B0055QYKQO|4.0|If you buy this and you have an older power supply 600 watts or less be careful, this thing will not boot with out a good power supply.<br />I had to dish out another 100 bucks for a new psu, but it was worth it, the motherboard runs great does what it says it does on the box.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I Loved the first two books! I could not wait to get my hands on the third and \\" final\\" part of the trilogy. Would not even really care that this was not the end of the trilogy if there was a story to follow. Honestly the first two were amazing and kept you guessing, You wanted them to work, You were fighting for them.<br />Nothing in this book was good.<br />I am so disappointed. I will have to really think about ever buying another book from her.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|First off,  let me state that I have been a mediocre fan of QOTSA but never die hard.  That has all changed with this album.  I have heard most of their material and have to say that this album to me is a great change for them.  There are great tracks on this album, but to fully appreciate it you have to play it in it's entirety.  I've read reviews about how slow the album is and that QOTSA are at their best when they rock hard.  As a whole this album isn't about rocking songs,  it's about the substance and feeling involved with the music.  To me the best songs are about Josh's experience with death, especially I Appear Missing, one of my favorite tracks on the album.  But hey,  If you are going to right a song about such experiences you better put your whole heart into it and he did and it shows.  To me this is a concept album and a great one at that.  I think some people aren't used to that from QOTSA but as all great bands do they have evolved into more than just rocking fast songs.  I am planning on seeing them when they come to my town,  I heard they have incorporated the awsome illustrations from the songs on their website.  Get this if you are a fan of GOOD MUSIC.  Listen with a OPEN MIND.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Very interesting about his experiences, particularly considering the fact that he is a neurosurgeon, but it goes on forever re: that experience.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Once upon a time I enjoyed this game but the recent update has caused it to crash every time it loads. I play on a kindle fire HD 7&quot;...rather, I used to play.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app is invaluable for managing files however whenever I try to play videos on it the app crashes my kindle fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoyed streaming this in HD. This was classic Downton. We can't wait until the next season can be streamed as part of our Prime membership.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I only gave this game three stars because it doesn't compare to diner dash or restaurant café on facebook. All you do is make the food and the game pretty much plays by itself. Not really a stimulation game
B007V65R54|4.0|I struggled with a rating for Silver's book.  I love his blog and am a huge fan of his work at Baseball Prospectus so I went in favorably disposed to the book.<br /><br />And after each chapter, I found myself nodding and jotting down notes.  I learned about some fields (earthquakes and professional poker) that I knew little about and I almost uniformly agreed with Silver's insights.  The Bayesian approach to prediction which Silver trumps also makes a lot of sense intuitively to me.<br /><br />So why not five stars?  After putting the book down, I struggled to figure out what it all meant.  The chapters don't really fit together all that well and the attempts at synthesis seem forced.  I think if the book had been presented as a series of essays on prediction, it would have been a no-brainer five star book.  But because Silver strove for something bigger, a synthesis of ideas about prediction and how to do it better, I found my hopes raised and then dashed.<br /><br />I guess I predicted the book would be perfect and Silver suffers (but just a bit) from my judging it against that prior belief.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|This calendar works well for me, it too does not sync because was wanting an exclusive email for the calendar but I have given up on that and try to keep everything in sync on my own,  not easy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book I knew going in that she had planned 5 books for this series so I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews. I can't wait for book 4 and 5. I love how Eva and Gideon are growing in their relationship and becoming stronger. If you liked book 1 and 2 and realize there are going to be 2 more after this one I dont' think you will have any problems with this book.
B0080SSYUW|4.0|Need a break from some heavy reading???<br />Try this.  A pleasant collection of stories,,,,,<br />except for \\"\\"FUNNY BOY\\"\\", which also was the best.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|downloaded this thinking I might play later, and now I can't stop playing it.  took me a while to get the hang of what the goal was (not just to join the puddings together, but to have them sitting on top of the stars at the end).  lots of fun and it's making me think in new ways.
0525478817|5.0|i thought this book was very good and very well written. as a 16 year old myself, i felt that John Green did a very good job in writing in the place of a teenage girl. much of the book depicted Hazel's thoughts, and i felt that her thoughts were realistic and similar to a teenage girl's. the segments about her parents and her friends and how she felt like she was hurting people by having a terminal illness were very striking, and it was interesting to get into the head of a cancer patient, ever though she is fiction. there was also a lot of anticipation in the book. you knew that anything could happen at anytime, and that keeps the reader reading. you never know what is going to happen. in many books, you can kind of guess what is going to happen and when, but in this book you never knew, just like how in real life; you never know what is going to happen. as the book went on, i really felt that i knew Hazel and and could commiserate with her and her troubles because her character was developed so well. details about her and her life were revealed early on in the story and it allowed me to focus on the story, instead of having to develop the characters for myself. i really loved that i could practically feel Hazel's feeling for myself. i also really loved this book because it is not only a book for teenagers or adults. anybody can read this book and relate to it in some way, whether its through Hazel, her struggles, or other characters like Gus. it is not necessarily a book about cancer, but a book about life and its ups and downs.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I was skeptical to download this app. I have not used it much since I loaded it. When I was using it, I used it for about 2 hours watching various videos from you tube. The app seemed to work just fine at that time. Like I said, I haven't used it recently, but liked it when I did.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|My boyfriend loves the first season of this show. It is very close to the book. The packaging and product were in excellent condition.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|A great final season to a fun and entertaining show.  Fun, entertaining and very enjoyable.  It has fun light moments and serious ones as well, a great balance.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Every aspect of the movie kept my attention. My kids loved it too! Would highly recommend this great movie! Awesome.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|seemed cheesy at first and prolly is but for some reason cant put it down,  nothing like a good neck flip to make the day go better....haha
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great coming-of-age story of courage and kindness. Both of my kids, ages 7 and 14, loved the book. I did too!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't believe it ended like that with no date for another book.  So what is up with Ann and what about<br />that video?  Really!  I will NOT buy any other stories from Sylvia Day however I will have this finish with this story.  I really hope Sylvia will focus on finishing this story and not make us wait so long for the next book this time.  I need her to focus on this story before writing any other books.  Really!  I still can not believe the ending was so bad and left so hanging!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful story telling! The main characters were very well-written and likeable. The chapters about the orphanage were disturbing, but crucial to the story. What a lovely and surprising ending - it brought tears to my eyes. I would definitely recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is like the new temple run. Only more addictive. Its also less confusing so its more often i decide to play it. I love the frequent updates. Its always fun with a change of scenery so this way it doesnt get boring. Ghe makers of this game have the right idea. :D
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was excited to find a Youtube app especially after reading some of the reviews, but after downloading I found that this app repeatedly places ads in the very center of videos you're trying to watch -- incredibly annoying.  I soon deleted it.  Why won't the Fire offer a decent plain Youtube app???
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This fun. I have played this with my grandchildren via computer and iPad. Can now play on my smartphone too!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The case has great quality, it has a great feel to it and it is very supportive of the Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend this ase very highly to anyone who is looking for good quality.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I know its alot like the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series but with different characters. Im half way through it and Im enjoying it. But read Percy Jackson first
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it! I can't wait to read what happens next in their lives!!lots of drama,love, and twists and that's why I loved the book.thank you Sylvia day! Can't wait to read the other books!
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Although many companies like the fictional \\"Great Benefit\\" have either changed their names, changed their methods of doing business, or gone bankrupt, the fact is that this was happening all throughout the United States. This movie tells the story very well with a great script and captivating characters. I really enjoyed it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn definitely loves to keep things dark and somewhat uncomfortable.  I couldn't put the book down about halfway through the book but when it ended i felt like I had been denied more information and more closure than I had received.  I felt the same way when I read Gone Girl.  It just ended and I just wanted one more chapter to give me more detail about what happened to the characters.  Definitely an enjoyable book and would recommend it to those that enjoyed Gone Girl
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Not like Cut the Rope but I has the same addictiveness to it and great fun fir hours at a time
B004GYY714|1.0|TuneIn knows about this problem and refuses to fix it.<br /><br />This happens when listening to a streaming audio URL and my WiFi is already set to never sleep or shut off, so no TuneIn -- it's not that.<br /><br />Fix this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|quality awesome playabilty awesome. multiplayer awesome everything. awesome. but update times my friend Dillon already got update 0.7.0 for the ipod but we don't cmon
B004D38HOG|5.0|And honest, very well written and enthralling account of portia's struggle with anorexia. Highly recommended. I was hooked from its gripping prologue to its feel good ending
B00881PTRC|4.0|I mean its fun but why cant you just do it on a piece of paper like old time.Get it f you want though
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is a pretty cool and practical app. I definitely recommend it. This the reason that I don't do reviews, I do not want to be told how many damn words I have to write!
B002PEP4C8|5.0|It was excellently and realistically written from the rape survivors perspective.  Characters are well developed.  It seems Alice Sebold writes well about what she &#34;knows&#34; (as in The Lovely Bones.)  Her second book was graphic, but kind of ridiculous.  If you liked her first novel, you'll probably enjoy this one.  Keep in mind however that this book is a realistic portrait of rape, its effects on the victim as well as on anyone else who relates to her.  Society is not prepared to deal with this trauma in any particularly helpful way.  I am a trauma therapist and would like readers to know that no one needs to live with the symptoms rape causes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best mystery/puzzle game that I have played.  The graphics are excellent.  Very entertaining.  I wish it had been longer.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Eva and Gideon. If ever two people belong together it is them.  Can't wait for the final book.
B00BMT9SQA|3.0|The movoie is to goofy for me . I didn't car for it.<br />Th actors were ex lent. . the plot was ok but they went to far with the humer.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I am hooked on this app.I have only had minor glitch. Took it off and downloaded it again. Worked fine after that. If you like games like candy crush saga and bejeweled this might be for you. Definitely worth trying it out. If you don't like it you can delete it. I like it and recommend kindle users to get this game. Great free app. Thanks-Shane
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love having this app because when i dont wanna get up it makes me get up. Lol it can be very annoying and that helps me wake up
0425263924|3.0|Yes, this book was total filler. Yes, it was just a setup for the additional two books. Yes, the book really had no coherent story--just a bunch of little secondary character plots strung together. Yes, Eva was starting to show her age a bit and act like a spoiled brat. And, yes, the \\"end\\" totally SUCKED (I was actually a bit insluted by the note from SD). However, all that being said, I would read about Gideon until my eyes fell out!<br /><br />The fourth book better be realeased quickly or Ms. Day is going to loose a lot of fans--if she hasn't already!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. Seen most of the movies. Just a few issues when loading the game, while on the internet it would close the game down and couldn't visit neighbors. So I thought, bad decision, I took it off my Kindle wheel, but left it on the cloud. I had to start from scratch... won't do that again.  I do love the game even with the stuff that doesn't load. Waiting for more great games to come out like these.
0800141849|5.0|I am just crazy for a love story, especially one that come close to my life.  Was extremely glad to get this one.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|this app would not load.  I did load the Kendal app. need help on loading apps to a Agptek tablet.
0061537969|3.0|Im not really liking this book that much. I heard it was so fabulous, but it seems kind of dumb to me. I hate to start a book and then not finish it so I keep reading. I'm about half way through.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Its cool because u can make ur own music to keep so yeah download this app now but you should be able to use your own music.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|whats the point of this an testing free app.if it doesnt let u do nothing at all.. this is a waste of internal memory....deleted
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Challenging puzzle game that is hard to put down.  Cute characters<br />and sounds. Makes you think to solve the puzzle.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I never.knew playin with puddin could be so good.  Purdy phun puzl game.  After playing just a few times my bald spot got smaller, I grew another 2 inches taller and the dog next door stopped barking.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve anything about their life.  Way better than the abflex...  good graphics and music.  Great time waster.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|IMDB Review:<br /><br />Seeing this gorgeous tango between Damon and Law, I was never less than captivated and riveted. Minghella has fashioned something literate, powerful, seductive, charming, tragic, and beautiful. His casting is nearly perfect. Damon is unforgettable as an amoral but fascinating character whom we even sympathize with by film's end. Law is stunning as Dickie, the man whose life Ripley adores. Paltrow is good, though she is not given a whole lot to do. Blanchett is perfect in a small but pivotal role that only adds to her already impressive filmography. This is a near-masterpiece. Minghella's talent for visual opulence is second to none, and his work here should earn him a directing Oscar nod. The same goes for many others associated with this brilliant achievement. The ending is as unsuspected as it is inevitable, that is, sad and unsettling. In fact, the whole film underscores these emotions. Whereas Highsmith's original novel was cold and sometimes inert, the film makes Ripley much more of a living, breathing character, and as such, a great symbol of tragedy. It may be some time before I forget this intense experience. Certainly one that deserves multiple viewings. One of the best films of 1999. I think this may be one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Bravo everyone. A moving, rich knockout!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed read the three books by this author.  I saw the movies after I read the books. and the books are al lot better.  The movie left out too much of the book.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it is a really fun game.but in zombies it is really to hard I am only on wave twenty.i'm stuck on a level in classic mode too
1594204217|4.0|I lent it out already and did not even get a chance to read, in high demand...heard about author on NPR
1432794426|5.0|Even though I haven't finished yet this book lets you see the human being our beloved Michael. A great father, friend and the greatest entertainer. Karen portrayed Michael as no other has. Ty Karen
B0065NAKRO|5.0|My husband and I love this game,  We play everynight before we go to bed.  It is simple to play and fun.  I have tried other Dominoes game and this one is the best.
0446554995|3.0|I have read the entire Pendergast series and have throughly enjoyed them.  But the this lastest story arc with Pendergast's dead wife returning and the &#34;Boys from Brazil&#34; plot makes this book especially unbelievable. I lost all attachment to the characters, the plot is way too contrived, and the book lacks the heart that they used to have.  When did Pendergast become like a severe comic book character that exceeds all normal human physical limitations? I used to really care about the surrounding cast members.  When Smithback was murdered way back, it shocked me and how it affected Nora Kelly made it that much more believable (despite a bizzare premise).  Constance Greene was such a great character, but she has added so little to the last few books, its been disappointing. It's nice to see a few of the characters grow, but their development is offset by exceedingly unrealistic events. I hope we have not seen Pendergast jump the shark.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Thomas Hardy really knew how to write some tragedy. When it was published, there was a big public debate about Tess - if she was an innocent or a bad girl that deserved what she got. Hard to believe from our perspective, but it'll give you an idea what life for women was like in Hardy's time.<br /><br />Acting and production values very good - recommended if you like period pieces.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|It has the action and great photography one has come to expect from this series of films.  Cruise is his usual with at least one scene with him running.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Can't tell too much, because I don't want to give it away, but the point of view is compelling and unique. This story mirrors the current news headlines, but puts the reader in a place they hadn't been before. I felt that the first part of the book went on too long, but on the whole felt pretty authentic. A great book for discussions.
B000LC55F2|5.0|One question raised by this film is: If science can explain how things appear to be magical, and illusion is based on manipulation of science,... which is the greater achievement?
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love Claire Danes!  What an incredible performance.  And Mandy Patinkin in one of the most remarkably reserved (in the best sense possible) performances of his career.  I'm hooked.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|When you do beat the game and it asks you to give the name of the character, it wont accept the answer, so you have to back out, and then it claims a perfect record.<br />Oh, and the permissions are more than unnecessary.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Entertaining puzzle game, cute characters, good for all ages, each level gradually gets more difficult, addictive, great way to pass the time
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A sort of coming of age love story with a nasty villain, set in a romantic time and place, and enough magic entertainment and intrigue to keep it from being soppy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book but once I did I couldn't put it down. Tons of unexpected twists and turns.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|Would have given 4.5 stars, since we wheel away from the book too much, but the lore is dead on, and as presented, great darn movie!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|CPU went from temperature's in the 80's and 90's (using stock cooler) to an average in the low 30's. Outstanding value and I can't imagine ever needing an expensive water cooling unit. This does the job at a fraction of the cost.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is definitely a 5 star book even if at the end you find yourself saying \\"oh dear Lord!\\"<br /><br />Who could be more romantic then a guy  who claims to not be romantic yet makes such grand gestures that makes even the readers heart ache. I love Gideon so much that if he were real I would be in serious danger of being one of his tons of stalkers lol!<br />And Eva, she is the kind of girl you wish was one of your best friends, she Is loyal, fun, and passionate, and full of sarcasm!<br /><br />These two together make such a hot and combustible couple, whom you can really feel the love they have for each other through the author's words! Sylvia, you did it again!<br /><br />Can't wait till her next book!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|As simply a toy, this product is fine. Its usefulness is more limited than some would let you believe, though. I lost interest 10 minutes after installing the batteries. If they hadn't been included, I would have felt I was being cheated out of my money.<br /><br />Pros: It comes with everything. I've known some devices where different pieces are sold separately, or they're defective, or what have you. The pen works, the UV ink attachment is included, and its batteries make it light up instantly. That's about as far as the fun goes before you start recognizing the problems...<br /><br />Cons: 1. Doesn't serve a purpose other then to look at. The UV light is the ONLY light on the screwdriver, giving it a very limited light-up range. Not even very fun when pointing it at a door pretending the screwdriver made it open (which I tried)... 2. The sound effects are pretty sad too, they're soft and sound more like a monkey trying to whistle than it does a screwdriver from the series... 3. Too many detachable pieces. The slider button cover can slip easily, along with the UV pen and regular pen detaching from the bottom make its PLASTIC design even less durable than I anticipated. The reason I emphasized plastic was because the other reviews I saw gave the hint that some parts were metallic, making it worth being a collector's item. At it stands, it's just a toy. A $30 toy.<br /><br />The final problem I encountered is the extension. I admit I was intrigues by the ability to have an \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" feature, something I hadn't seen in other Sonics I looked at. After installing the batteries, the activator button is live, essentially. Any pressure whether intentional or unintentional makes it go off. So when sliding the device from \\"closed\\" to \\"open\\" and vice versa, the button can be activated during the slide. It just seems like a flaw in the design, but it can be an annoying flaw if some youngster catches on and leaves the device in between on purpose.<br /><br />Overall, its size and purposes are impressive. It's a diverse multipurpose tool, but I would not call it durable, nor would I describe it as a must-have. To quote a different sic-fi series (if that's allowed): \\"Size matters not.\\" DO NOT be impressed by how big it is. This screwdriver is twice the size of my sonic screwdriver LED torch, but I think the smaller device I own will last longer and serve me better.<br /><br />Just make sure you have done all your research before making the purchase, and make sure you're buying it for the right age range. A young child may be very impressed with this as their first Sonic Screwdriver. For a 20-somethings like myself, I was disappointed.
0425263924|1.0|Half-way through the book - and still looking for the plot?  This book does not have the same feel at the first two, and very disappointing.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This version of the movie was even less funnier than the trailers. A lot of the dialogues from the trailers seemed to have been cut from this version. I would really recommend you never to watch this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really wanted this book to end, but it just keeps dragging on and on with different stories.  I didn't feel like their was even and ending of a good cliffhanger for the next book. The book is still steamy as ever, but I caught myself rushing through the book to try and get through the fluff. Really disappointed!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Initial thoughts:<br /><br />I recently purchased the Logitech 930 series headphones taking a risk on the problems that other reviewers have reported.  Out of the box I was really quite happy with the build quality of the product.  The headset seems to be very sturdy and not cheaply made.  Installation was super easy and fast.  I downloaded the most recent software from the Logitech website and was impressed with how easy it is to interface with. I also like the fact that Logitech gives you plenty of charging cable so that you dont have to be too close to the base station while charging and utilizing the headphones at the same time.<br /><br />Sound quality:<br /><br />Before I bought this head set I was using the Razer Megalodan head set.  I've had alot of issues with my old headset ie. crackling sounds, complete loss of sound, lighting on the headset in-operable.  For the $129 I paid a few years back, the sound of the Megalodan doesn't even come close to the sound that the Logitech 930 produces. The 7.1 surround sound is crystal clear as well as the mic.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I really like this headset, however, I will say there a few cons about it which is why I gave it a four star rating.  The head set is comfortable, however I feel that the ear pads are a little on the uncomfortable side as they will make you start to sweat after wearing them for 30 min or so.  It's not a deal breaker for me, but just something to think about.  The other caveat is that I wish Logitech would have included a case.  For $109 I wouldn't have expected one, but when this set first came out it was $159.99 and a case definitely should have been included for that steep of a price.  My Razer Megalodan head set came with an awesome case that I will now be using for my new Logitech 930 head set. Lastly, I think the G buttons and voice morphing are kind of gimmicky.  If I'm playing a game, the last thing i'm going to do is take my hands off the keyboard to touch a button on my headphones.  The voice morphing isn't really my style and i didnt purchase these headphones to utilize that feature, but hey whatever floats your boat I guess.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />All in all this is a great set of headphones.  I don't think you can go wrong for Amazon's price of $109. I think if you look at the issues that other customers had you will notice that alot of them were operating on the same channel as their router.  I made sure my router was on a different channel and i've had absolutely zero connecting issues.  For the price, look, and feel I would definitely recommend these to anyone.
1582406723|5.0|These are the best books ever. I am not a comic book guy but after watching the tv show I am hooked on the comics to see what will happen in the upcoming seasons.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Amazing storyline and movie. French humour has a class of it's own. The acting as well as the direction was fantastic. What was even more amazing was to know that this was based on a true story.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. its as good as the movie was. it starts Esau but then it gets harder. it truthy is the best game I ever played.
0547564651|5.0|It came quickly and the book was in great shape!<br />This is a great book to read, especially if you are  a teacher, It gives you a new perspective on students.<br />Thank you!
0375851569|3.0|Was given to somebody as a gift so I have no input from the person receiving this item.. This rating is just my opinion.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I have to admit, the first time through the album I thought &#34;eh, it's not better than High Violet, Boxer, or Alligator&#34;.  But, after further review and upon after many, many repeated listenings, I have to say that this is their best album released!<br />I Should Live In Salt is a no-brainer great song out of the gate.<br />Demons was also a classic National sound, loved the low baritone voice on this one.<br />Don't Swallow the Cap picks up the pace and I love the drum patterns throughout this song.<br />Sea of Love is very catchy and better and better every time I listen to it.<br />This is the Last Time is one of my favorite track on the album but the first time I heard it was like &#34;Meh&#34;.  Love the building up and letting down, oh yeah, and the lyrics.<br />Graceless is absolutely without a doubt the best song on the album!  I had to pick one and this is it.  The lyrics are awesome!<br />I Need My Girl is a great ballad, very emotional.<br />Pink Rabbits is like 2 songs in one...at the 3:30 mark they break into a chant &#34;You said it would be painless, it wasn't that at all.&#34; that I can't seem to quick singing over and over well after the music has stopped playing. :)<br /><br />There is nothing to dislike about this album, trust me, after a few repeated listens, the entire album just has a natural connection to each track and it flows very well.<br /><br />If there was a way to wear a groove into an MP3 like when listening to an LP, this album would be worn out!!!<br />Happy listening.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slow start for all the great reviews, but then it got so good I couldn't put it down. Fast read.
1433502410|5.0|This Bible  is very large but is chock full of information for someone who wants to go more in depth in studying the Bible
B008220BP2|4.0|Zombie Rom Com ???  Yep.  Not a horror flick, so don't expect blood and screaming.  The Zombie Apocalypse has occurred, and there is the usual pocket of humans surviving behind tall, concrete walls.  Outside roam the undead.  Mostly slightly worse for wear; with a few skinless, vicious types called Bonies.  Otherwise - but wait, what soft in yonder, uh, wrong play - If I only had a heart.  A beating one, as one of the corpses begins to have feelings for a human out scavenging for supplies.  Is it a cure?  Bonies not likey at all.<br />This film wouldn't have a chance without second banana Rob Cordday (The Daily Show).  His spot on, little drops of perfection make everything work amidst the amateur hour of the lead \\"actors\\".<br />It made me laugh, it's kinda dumb - but what Rom Com isn't?  7/10
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  Was a great vacation read. Wanted to know what happened to Victoria. Kept my attention well.
0425263924|4.0|I am a big fan of Sylvia Day's writing starting with the Renegade Angels Series.  While I am a big fan of the Crossfire Series and was really excited about this book, touting this series as better then FSoG to my friends, I felt this story was more filler than anything.  Gideon got real mushy with Eva, I thought he was going to cry every time he told her he loved her.  I really wanted to see the more manly side of Gideon too, like in the last books not necessarily with all the fighting(book 2) but something else.  The sex scenes were good but IRL at some point it's gotta hurt :) I was expecting the series to end and am kinda happy it didn't but hope we don't have to wait too long for the next installment and I hope Mrs. Day takes into consideration all the honesty of her fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and cool.But it gets you angry and they would give more time to find the thoughts things like Russian dolls and something else
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I will take Crossfire over Fifty any day! Love Gideon and I am glad that the story does not end here. Just don't make us wait to long for the next book.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This series has been a guilty pleasure, that I can't seem to put down. I enjoy the detailed nature of the characters.
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|This is a hot album from a new artist. I was taken with her free song \\"Sweet Talk.\\" All of the songs are great songs to relax to or get romantic with or pre-party with on Friday Nights. I loved it so much I bought one for $3.99 for myself and sent one to my best friend -- it is that good.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|This is the Third installment of The Men in Black (3). This Sequel Takes you back in time to when Tommy Lee Jones character was much younger. It follows along with the previous Men in Black movies. Well done.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|This is  a funny movie that I will recommended to everyone. Is an old movie, but is one of the kind.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I see a lot of reviews with readers disappointed in the ending. I am never thrilled when a book ends with a cliffhanger. However, I am excited that there will be more to come! I love the story of Gideon and Eva. I have enjoyed watching them evolve throughout the books thus far, and will continue to follow them when Day releases the next books to come. Whether or not this series was originally marketed as a \\"trilogy\\" makes no difference to me. I enjoy a good story this is one that continues to stay with me. Love it! Better than Fifty Shades, in my opinion.
0143119680|3.0|I really liked the rich historical context of this book and I liked the locations and descriptions used by the author. The only thing I didn't like was Diana. While she is smart, educated and sometimes witty, she is also just another woman swept off her feet into the arms of the nearest vampire. She begins to depend on Matthew also most as much as Bella depended on Edward. She has an obvious temper and a sense of independence but seems to lose the latter when she meets her undead knight. Everything she does or says revolves around Matthew to the point she almost drowns herself when he leaves her for a short period of time. It was very Bella-esque. While I understand the meaning and nature of their relationship, the dependence she has on him is a bit overly done from other novels. The reason I gave it three stars is because of the reasons I gave above and the character development was very detailed and it helped to mask the undertones of the needy relationship that was also going on.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy is another suspenseful and action packed Sequel  to the Jason Bourne Series. This sequel is just as full of international suspense as as its predecessors. You will not be disappointed with this movie.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|A lot of humor and action that anyone can going to enjoy from the beginning to the end. A lot of my friends like it too.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Ugh, I'm always disappointed when a book I've been really excited about doesn't really soar to my expectations. Perhaps therein lies the reason why I've been disappointed - I build things up too much.<br /><br />Eh, regardless, I was a bit put off by this book. Don't get me wrong, Sylvia Day is an excellent writer. The flow of the story and writing aren't the issues; it's the story itself. I think the best way to describe Entwined with You is it felt like one long epilogue. Carefully plotted sex scenes mixed with a recap of what happened in the first two books, while all these loose ends being tied up in a nice little bow. Then in the last 10% of the book, things start coming unraveled, the story ends rather abruptly, and there's a note from Sylvia telling us that Gideon and Eva's story isn't over yet and we should look forward to the next book. I mean, I knew going in that the series was going to continue, but just... ugh.<br /><br />It must be said, I don't mind waiting for a book, especially when it involves characters that I'm heavily invested in. If the story is worth it, the time it took to wait truly means very little. However, when I finally get my hands on a book after waiting, only to have to wait for yet another, when nothing has really happened in the current book... that is truly frustrating. I would rather read a 1000 page book and wait longer, than wait a fair amount of time and have the plot be rather stagnant. Get what I'm saying?<br /><br />There was effort to make things dramatic, albeit not very successfully:<br />1. The reappearance of Brett Kline, Eva's rocker ex-fling. Eh. Boring.<br />2. Detectives, sniffing around Gideon and Eva after Nathan's murder, hence the reason why they must remain apart. This could have been good. This should have been the crux of the entire plot (it started off that way, anyhow). Actually! The whole Nathan murder should have been, but apparently not. It seemed to be shoved under the proverbial rug, just so we wouldn't see Gideon as this monster. But let's be honest... HE KILLED SOMEONE. I mean, killed. Dead. Murder. Is this not an issue for anyone else? To me, the murder never really seemed to be in character for Gideon in the first place, no matter how protective he wanted to be of Eva... but eh, what do I know? I'm merely a reader. Okay, whoa... tangent... back to the detectives. We really only read about them specifically one time, and before that, they were mentioned in passing. The fact that the detectives were even an issue would have actually made me worry at all if Eva had seen them following her, for example, or if they came to visit her more than just once. Make me worry, damn it! Don't just tell me that they're a problem. I need to feel it.<br />3. Corrine, Gideon's ex-fianc&eacute; and the woman he was basically using to make it seem like he was leaving Eva. Okay, I don't know about you, but I'm over it. I'm over her. As far as I know, he was rather up front about their pseudo-relationship for the press, and is now all &uuml;ber-depressed about him no longer needing her. Okay, I understand the effect Gideon has on women. That fact was established in the first two books. I get it. Can we move on now?<br />4. Deanna, the reporter, and Gideon's ex-one time thing. Again, a bit boring. She was just sort of annoying, more than anything. And again, see above. Yet another woman feeling scorned by Gideon wanting revenge, or attention, or whatever. There was even a brief appearance of Anne, the married woman he had an affair with... and she was still warning Eva about how Gideon uses women. I GET IT! HE USED TO BE A COLD, MAN-WHORE. I'm. Over. It.<br />5. The island getaway. I mean, was this really s surprise to anyone? It was really sweet... but didn't he just kill someone like a week before? Eh, I just won't get over that, I guess.<br /><br />Okay, this really makes it seem like I didn't enjoy the book at all. I did, really. Like I previously said, the writing is great. And I'm really glad Gideon and Eva are finally moving forward toward a (fairly) functional relationship. Although it must be said, obsession is not functional and neither is rushing into marriage after knowing each other for a month, but that's neither here nor there. I just wasn't all that impressed with the story, I guess. Lots of sex. I mean, lots of sex. Too much, actually. I know Gideon and Eva have an explosive, sexual connection. I don't need this re-established. I read the first two books, and now this is the third... so, let's move on. As mentioned before, the storyline began to wrap up a lot of the loose ends, and at the last 10-15% of the story, there was a clear set-up for books four and five. It just feels like the story was grasping at straws. Very tiny, insignificant straws.<br /><br />Eh... I suppose I'll just wait for the next book.ly glad Gideon and Eva are finally moving forward toward a (fairly) functional relationship.

B000LC4ZF8|5.0|More good clean fun starring a young Tom Hanks that I think showed his versatility as an actor and I think got him recognized
B009MO5G90|2.0|I can't believe i bought the entire collection of RE movies, they are so lame. I guess I was really bored and I am a fan of the original Playstation games etc, but Jovovich is good enough looking to carry the entire weight of this bland series of movies. Her husband is marginally talented, and basically I mean he has 0 talent... no eye for cinematographic visions regarding camera placement or original shot creation/style. All the movies including this one in 3D are bland, lifeless dirges into banality. The characters look like they are in Halloween costumes and merely speaking the dead dialogue into a void. The action scenes are trying to be camp and comic book but come off staged and fabricated like a high school play. Milla doesn't really even fill out her spandex lol, she's hot in a way but this series of movies really turned me off especially realizing the complete nepotistic situation of husband and wife/director/actress scenario going on throughout all the films. The only thing they've brought from the original mythos of the game world is the cheap tacking on of hundreds of Umbrella Corp. logos pasted all over every scene, their eyes, their wallets, their guns, their whatevers... no matter what it's got an Umbrella logo stamped on it. The 3D bumps it up to 2 stars, but not by much.
B0071BY1CO|5.0|Very nice clear clean print. 3D effects just right. Movie fills in back story very well. Enjoyed the film. Worth buying.

B000002J2D|4.0|ATTWT is one of the most overlooked and underrated Genesis albums. I think a pinnacle is reached here for the late 70's prog Genesis......It wasn't mixed as as well as Trick or Wind in my opinion... keyboards tend to drown things out in the mix at times... still amazing stuff from Banks. Phil's drumming is fantastic as well on this album. May be his best. Probably some of his greatest work vocally too. It grows on you after a number of listens.
0812993845|1.0|There is simply no reason for the characters to do what Kinsella has them doing; the book falls apart almost instantly.<br /><br />It is a disappointment, but the last couple of her books have lacked the sparkle and wit of earlier works.  I think this is my last Kinsella, at least for a long time.<br /><br />Zero Stars...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm finding it hard trying to rate this book and As much as it pains me to do it I'm going to have to give it 3 to 31/2 stars. This book lacked so much of the Eva and Gideon from before. Where was the fireworks, the explosions. Basically we got sex and lost of it. Not that it was bad but it was so out of character for  them to be so explosive and then suddenly realize they trust one another and their possessive sides take a back burner. It was like they talked, sex ,  talked, sex, argued a little nothing crazy made up and of course had sex...yes I get they are addicted to one another but I miss the crazy. I think I need the heart stopping moments just because that's who they are. Yes I want a HEA but I want the drama and angst they bring. I waited for something to make one of them explode but it's like they were so calm. I need the feisty Eva and ever so possessive Gideon.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock is one of the modern era of British television shows that are changing the game. It is a smart, witty interpretation of the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle character that holds with the Holmes mythology, but at the same time is a sharp modern tale.

B0001I561E|3.0|Firstly let me say that both my husband and I LOVE Aladdin. We have been eagerly waiting for it to come out on Blu Ray only to be constantly disappointed as other Disney films made it out first. For my husbands birthday I decided to go ahead and purchase Aladdin on DVD. When the DVD arrived, however, we discovered that the Platinum Edition is not a typical DVD but rather a dual layered DVD disc that is not necessarily compatible with every media device. Our Blu Ray player (which is designed to play DVDs as well) could not read the disc. It played fine on our computer (an older model) and our older DVD player, but not the new Blu Ray we purchased a few months ago. Upon closer inspection we realized that the problem was a compatibility issue and were able to watch it on an older DVD player we had stored away. Thankfully we had the DVD player or else we wouldn't have been able to watch the movie. I re-read the product description and didn't see anything that mentioned a chance for compatibility issues, though when I looked the DVD up online it mentioned repeatedly that this particular dual layered disc might not work for all players. The seller ought to add a note letting buyers know. It was very disappointing to have spent so much money for a product that was a great deal of hassle. That being said, we love the movie and are very satisfied with the quality of the product. It came in a timely manner, neatly packaged and in perfect condition.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a complex movie detailing the nature of the spiritual journey throughout our many lifetimes. In a very creative way it showed how our actions have consequences that extend far beyond the present moment and how the soul evolves through its many life experiences. It also gave us a glimpse of a potential future in which genetic engineering and purposeful deception are used to both control and demean the serving class.This is a very thought-provoking movie with an excellent cast of characters that one will want to watch more than once to fully comprehend its depth.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Movies will never get any better than Labyrinth. David Bowie did the music, Jim Henson did the puppets. It has an amazing story, great acting, great visuals, great everything. This is the pinnacle of movies. I grew up watching this movie, and I still play it about once a day.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is nice, fun to play when you speed things up and it gets challenging which is very good.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Orphan Black is starting to gain some major buzz - that's why I gave it a try. The lead actress - Tatiana Maslany - is someone I recognized (and had liked) in other small parts in a few Canadian shows. Nothing would've prepared me for her performance in this show, however! She's freakin' awesome! She plays several different characters (and their accents) so convincingly.<br /><br />The show itself is kind of a mix of Alias meets Lost... but more realistic. lol. There's so much crazybannanas stuff going on, but at the same time it just kinda flows so effortlessly that you never think it couldn't happen. Very clever and hip. I'm encouraging everyone I know to give it a try.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Great storyline.  The ultimate &#34;reality show&#34;.<br />What if we were ALL on some sort of &#34;Tv Show&#34; for the rest of the universe to watch?<br />haha.  The Earth Channel?

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this unique novel written in the first person. I felt as if I shared the character's journey as well. There were parts when I laughed, cringed, shouted for joy and even cried for \\"the hero\\". I felt the author really gave a gift to the reader as I could not wait to read my kindle. It was addicting and I felt that I owed the characters my complete attention, as I savoired each page. Pat was a heart wrenching character that kept promising himself that he would \\"get better\\".His mother tried to help him rally from his downfall. His father ignored his struggles. Overall, the family dynamics seem typical, somewhere the reader can understand and relate.<br />At times we struggle to search what our true intentions should be in relationships, work and love. Pat struggles through out the novel to find his \\"silverlining\\"! I enjoyed all the characters in the novel. They became familiar to me and I enjoyed how the author tweeked each one. The heartbreak of Nikki was believable yet to read about Tiffany who plays such a powerful role(don't want to give any juicy details away)is breath-taking, almost exhausting! I don't know if I want to see the movie, as I adore Bradley Cooper; yet I am still savouring this delicious read!!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  Some things I loved, others not so much.  As a avid fan of the Crossfire series I would recommend reading it and will read the next two.  But after two exceptional books I guess I expected more.  Hopefully the next one will rock!

0142421715|5.0|I am twelve and my friends encouraged me to buy these books. It turns out it was the best decision ever. I liked this book a lot better than matched. It was a faster paced book that was a lot more exciting. I do think that it was a little confusing wit the perspective switching. Normally I do not get confused when authors do this, but they seemed to speak and think in the same way so I was constantly trying to remember who's point of view I was reading. Though I still loved the way it was written. It was always making me want to read more
B00A6N757C|5.0|Best line of the show:<br /><br />\\"So you do have balls! RUN!\\"<br /><br />Pretty much sums the entire season up, methinks.<br /><br />-Springer
B003G4W49C|4.0|The story was well paced, interesting, and obviously well thought out. The plot was cohesive and flowed well. Even the dialog (often a sticking point in this genre) seemed genuine.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a great buy!  I've read the books, and now am hooked on the series.  Every episode leaves you wanting to watch the next!
B00C7O8MJ8|3.0|I like the music but I thought its just a remix of the origional....I didn't really care for selection #6 though...too loud and just noisy
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The writing in this book was superb. I think this is his best writing to date as I've read several of Mr. Sparks books. I was a little spooked about the ghost element he has added in his last two books though. I love the story telling. My spouse and I were driving around town so that I could read the book out loud to him. I loved, Mr. Sparks portrayal of the cousins, we laughed and we laughed. The ending, well I will not spoil it, but I'm sure it has already been mentioned. I didn't like the ending because I like happy endings, but I understand and respect Mr. Sparks for not glorifying adultery. It's a high compliment to say that even though I didn't not like all the elements in this book, it was captivating and I could not put the book down. From time to time my husband and I still talk about the book. The characters were real to us. Great job, hopefully your next book will be WITHOUT ghosts.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Utter disappointment very frustrating too long of a delay in coming out and now this total frustration and very disappointing

B009T8XBBO|5.0|I love this game and play everyday. Highly recommended if you like this genre. Well worth the small investment. Go ahead and get it.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|The first season hooked the whole family.  We watched all the way through season 5!! Can't wait until season 6!  The bonus is enjoying Baker's antics and cuteness as Patrick Jane.
B00821PCJS|5.0|A captivating look at survival in a &#34;what if&#34; scenario of aliens coming to take over our planet.  The storyline is surprisingly realistic in an unreal setting.  The scenes flow nearly seamlessly and the acting is believable and well performed.  Every episode is exciting and caused that &#34;I can't wait to see the next one&#34; feeling.  I highly recommend this for any sci-fi/thriller/fantasy afficionados out there.

Average time without a frozen frame is about 8 minutes.  -- Using a DVD player which is about 8 months old, which I've used without incident innumerable times, I experienced playback problems numerous times while trying to view this DVD.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Sherlock is a versatile actor and shows a lot of diversity in his role.  Watson is far from a side kick, without her it obviously couldn't work but it's obviously more than that, she is what makes him tick.  I recommend the show and can't wait for the next season to begin!

B008S4FZHI|3.0|Not up to the usual Patricia Cornwell standard.  Too much about the dysfunctional lives of Kay Scarpetta, Benton Wesley, Marino and Lucy.  Not enough suspense and puzzling.  And the final outcome was not really credible.  Will think twice before I buy another book by this author
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Loved the book from beginning to end - sorry when it finished. The bits about New York, the drugs, handling treatment in the rehab place and the stories and people.

B008JJM88Q|3.0|Ok, this app is like 20 questions.  I see by the questions how it figures out the answer.  Any clever person or someone who has a large trivia base can do this.  It is only about characters,.  I was not surprised when it figured out Jane Austen by the questions, and even Sponge Bob Square Pants.<br /><br />But I am sure most who do not catch on, will be amazed.  It is interesting and fun.  I find however, for me, it gets old fast.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I went into it with an open mind and ended up enjoying it as much as the first two in this series of 5 books. I get people are frustrated at the release date set back on this book but...chill out, she's a writer and a human being with a family and is allowed - dare I say it - a social life. It can't all be about churning out books, and with as many books as Ms Day as produced to date she's doing a really great job.<br /><br />The story line moved at a great pace, had plenty of ...excitement...to keep me entertained and sucked in. So much so I read 70% of the eBook on the first day, and stayed up late last night finishing it. The events in the book seem realistic and not just there for the sake of having stuff going wrong or to cause tension.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one in the series :)
B005C0DHIK|3.0|This is a decent documentary, but paints a picture that is not 100% fact. The shaky camera was a little frustrating, but it does put the viewer in the moment and makes them feel like they are a part of the action taking place. I did not know much about fracking before and learned about it some from this documentary, but even more so by doing research after watching it. Some shenanigans have been highlighted since this was released including the bits about flaming tap water. It has become clear the writer/director was not providing all of the details that he clearly knew - likely because it would have got in the way of a better story. It is sad really, because it makes it difficult to trust him and I believe his points could have been made without this. I have not yet watched FrackNation, which supposedly gives an opposing viewpoint on fracking than the one presented in Gasland. I would just recommend that after watching Gasland that you also do further research by basic Google searches (Gasland fraud). Do not take this documentary as 100% fact. Should we be concerned about fracking, the chemicals used, the potential polluting of our waters? The answers are al yes.  John Fox is making a follow-up - Gasland 2, so it will be interesting to see how far he goes in correcting or continuing to propagate some of the sleight-of-hand methods he used in this first Gasland documentary.

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|In 1979 Roderick Thorp wrote the bestselling novel, Nothing Lasts Forever, likely little knowing that his created strange iconoclastic hero John McClane would be such a long running success of a series of films: since the first film version DIE HARD was created in 1988 there have been five films that sustain audience interest in this wildly unimaginable character - Die Hard, Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Live Free or Die Hard, and now A Good Day to Die Hard. Thorp is still given credit in the titles of the characters despite the fact that he died in 1999. But Bruce Willis lives on and in the current version he encounters his son (played by the very talented and hunky Jai Courtney) and the action is doubled.<br /><br />John Mclane (Bruce Willis, aging well) has been a New York City and a Los Angeles cop who somehow always has explosions in the air and on the ground in every undertaking. But now, the take-no-prisoners cop, for the first time, finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack (Jai Courtney) - unaware that Jack is really a highly-trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover that their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.<br /><br />The cast tosses in bit parts by Sebastian Koch and Yuliya Snigir as the father daughter Russians with a secret, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, Amaury Nolasco, Cole Hauser as the CIA good guys, Rasha Bukvic, Sergei Kolesnikov, Roman Lukn&aacute;r as the Russian bad guys, and particularly funny Pasha D. Lychnikoff as a singing Cabbie.<br /><br />As directed by John Moore with a minimal script by Skip Woods this is a very noisy, megalomaniacal destruction derby of cars absurd and annoying to the max!), fire explosion mess of a film, but then it IS a Die Hard genre piece and the interplay between Willis and Courtney make it fun to observe how close to the tree the apple falls! Rasty, nasty action film for those who love them. And it looks like Australian actor Jai Courtney is on the rise.  Grady Harp, June 13o the tree the apple falls! Rasty, nasty action film for those who love them. And it looks like Australian actor Jai Courtney is on the rise.  Grady Harp, June 13
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Love the original, love the sequels. The idea itself is not so original, but here again it is all in the execution. Graphics, gameplay, all are very well designed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|- please note: I knew there was going to be more than 3 books in this series because I follow Sylvia on Twitter. So the fact that this is book number 3 of 5 was not a surprise to me.<br /><br />I was one of those people that felt a little disappointed with the 2nd book. So when I finished this one, I was definitely a happy camper. I enjoyed this book a lot. I felt that it answered some questions for me that I had from the 2nd book. I also loved that Eva as an individual, as well as Eva & Gideon as a couple, became stronger. Yes the secondary characters get a lot more play in the book, but I didn't mind it so much. Also, the 'cliff hanger' doesn't feel like as big of a cliff hanger as the 2nd book had, to me at least.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book and look forward to the next two.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I was in my 20's when this occurred.  For me the movie certainly clarified and brought back memories of the events.<br />I've run across people like me who love the movie and people who just don't like it at all.

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved &#34;Safe Haven&#34;!! Great plot and actors/actresses. Nicholas Sparks outdone himself with this movie!<br />A great chick- flick no doubt about it but my son who is 24 also loved this movie
014312336X|5.0|A fascinating tale of a brutal murder, against the every-day life of Peking in the turbulent years prior to the Japanese invasion/  The book captures the flavor of how both Chinese and westerners contended with the Chinese capital.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a great and engaging show.  The writing has improved for the second season and I look forward to the third coming out!
B009MYARIK|3.0|This is a silly, far-fetched, implausible story about a couple who are being impeded from consummating their marriage by the sister of the bride who would like the marriage annulled. It is funny and if you are interested in light, escape reading this may appeal to you. It is not one of Sophie Kinsella's best books.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|I really had a hard time getting into this movie, which was probably no fault of the movie but I was keeping my 5 & 6 year old grandsons who continuously needed e away from the TV while I was trying to watch it....Made it hard to follow the story line. Just a note to let you know that my grandsons had already watched this movie and both told me they loved it!
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell exhorts the advantages of intuition, of fast decisions, but admits that in certain circumstances rational pondering is advantageous. Easy reading in a journalistic style, but without real insights.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok so not so much of a \\"trilogy\\" but makes me excited this means another one!! I want more Gideon Cross!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I was a little apprehensive about renting this movie because I was not familiar with the video games portrayed in this movie. But it did not take me long to become very interested  in the story-line. Good movie that my young grandsons really enjoyed also!
B007QEHQY6|2.0|The rest of the set is okay, but the one disk shows the wrong information. The disk showed up as Joan Jett. The disk data was not available for Holst from that seller (EMI). Adding the disc to my library required manual input of all tracks, a chore I hate doing.<br /><br />  P.S. - I really love Joan Jett, just not classically :-)

Gideon and Eva continue to navigate their sometimes rocky relationship with plenty of steamy and touching moments throughout.<br />When I heard that there would be 5 books in the Crossfire series, I'll admit that I was disappointed. I wanted G & E to have their HEA. But I feel like its necessary for their story to extend it. It would've felt rushed otherwise.<br />Nice job Sylvia.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|When my Kindle Fire HD's battery icon suddenly changed from a green pulsing indicator into a solid white battery with a lightning bolt in the middle, I tried multiple times, unsuccessfully, to reset my device and resync the battery with the charger (per the instructions on the Kindle help forum).<br /><br />I became increasingly irritated at having to continually go to the device settings to check on how much battery life I had remaining. Luckily I came across this handy little app!<br /><br />Not only does it show me how much battery life remains, it also verbally notifies me when to recharge and when it's fully charged and it shows me the temperature of my battery! It allows me to choose the color of my battery and lets me set the intervals, in percentages, for when to notify me. I honestly couldn't be happier with this app.<br /><br />I actually prefer it to the old green indicator, before it went postal on me! This app is user friendly, fun, and reasonably priced...with many other extras! I highly recommend this app for everyone who has had, or eventually has, the same issue as me.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton is always a winner in my book, but this movie has an excellent supporting cast as well. Plus, i teach a reading class at a community college and this movie is based on a short story from the 1990's which makes it great supplemental material for a reading project.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The critics panned this movie;  I must have watched a different version than they did, because I thought this film was a wonderful throwback to the old adventure film genre, but with modern pacing and excellent use of CGI.  The music was a winner too.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Although a cartoon, the story was engaging and the plot was solid. The dialogue had enough chuckles that kept both me and my 6 year old chuckling. Most intriguing was a few of the music pieces were great...some Afro-middle eastern battle anthem, sounded great in surround.<br />And besides, can you ever go wrong with Star Wars?!

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This story is getting ridiculous. The series should have ended with this book. This is just another case of trying to suck more money out of the readers. I'm very disappointed. I certainly won't be buying another Crossfire novel.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|This is a exciting thriller with many twists.  Some scenes made my jaw drop in surprise.  The pacing and direction are top notch, I highly recommend it!
B004PGAQMW|1.0|I purchased this video because I wanted to watch it, obviously. First off, it was annoying how you needed to download the downloader for this video to work. Secondly, it didn't work. The download started, but it never showed up. All I got was a .jpg of the cover and that was it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun for children of all ages kinda complicated but very very fun.<br />I've been playing it nonstop. I would get it if I were you.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love Dragonvale because you can train your own dragon! the only down side is it does not load that fast it takes five minutes on my kindle fire. but other than that I highly recommend  this game to everyone!!!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I love Josh Groban and have enjoyed each album, but I really like some of the songs on this new release.  There are a couple of very slow songs - a bit drab, but the majority are great.  My 10 year-old really likes the first two tracks.  We play them over and over for the beat.  Good music from a great musician.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Very well made, and very fun. I'm already half way through the game. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle games.
0740745271|3.0|I have had a previous version of this series which I really enjoyed. This one - not so much. I think the author spent way too much time touting the &#34;health&#34; aspects of reading this book -  improved vision, relaxation, etc. I got this book because it was fun. Previous books had many more 3D pictures to view. This one spent too much time on verbage and had less than 1/3 of the actual pictures of previous books. I would reccomend earlier versions.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Beginning of a landmark series!  Great story lines and memorable actresses/actors-PBS has another homerun with this one!  More than just &#34;birthin' babies&#34;!
B005H9B44A|4.0|Lots of action and adventure.  Show got better as it got closaer to end.  This is my 1st Amamxon Prime viewing.
B0045XKJBI|3.0|Agai, trying to set up my fest...couldn't find a cheaper copy on-line...probably could have bought it at Walmart for less.  The premise gets a little more ridiculous but entertaining to watch.  Also, get on with the consummation.

B0016BP0PW|3.0|Hubby wanted this movie...I watched it w/him on TV a while back.....in my opionion, it's not a bad movie & I did truly enjoy it....but it isn't a movie I would watch over & over in a short period of time.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I only orderd thecord because it said it was 5 ft long and not close people it is 3 ft, no different than the one that comes with the Kindle fire.<br /><br />So if your looking for a 5 footer this isn't it.<br /><br />No Way, Not happy
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I only wish for the worlds to be bigger but other than that best app ive ever bought
B003O2RQKI|5.0|Absolutely Great performance. The recording is exceptionally good and the way it is filmed allows us to appreciate the mastery of Lang Lang as pianist. The way he played the third movement of &#34;Appassionata&#34;  is memorable; and I kept thinking how impressed and pleased Beethoven would have felt had he listened to this kind of performance.
B0089PJFFY|5.0|Anne Frank was a willful young lady with dreams that surpassed the life WWII afforded her. The Diary of a Young Girl was such a great read. Reading her words made the war feel all the more real to someone so far from the action.<br /><br />Her diary was an amazing account of the years Anne and her family spent in the secret annex hiding during WW II and the prosecution of the Jewish people. Anne was spunky and kind and passionate. She went through puberty and disliking her parents, just like every other teenager, but her daily struggle to remain hidden was one unlike anything the youth of today have had to experience.<br /><br />I felt like I lost a friend upon completion of her diary. She was a truly gifted writer and an incredibly deep thinker. I urge the readers out there to check out this novel. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />http://nobodyputssarahinthecorner.com
B001QB5SFO|3.0|I enjoyed it. My wife saw it on TV and had to have it. She has watched a couple of times and will watch it again and again.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Huge letdown, the big build up to the final book and then nothing. The author has the right to change her mind, and I have the right to dislike her change!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is a thrilling novel featuring a sociopathic spouse and the lengths they will go to in order to get what they want.<br /><br />It all starts when Nick Dunne's wife Amy goes missing. Amy is not just any ordinary wife, she is the inspiration for the Amazing Amy, a series of children novels written in tandem by her parents Rand and Elliot.<br /><br />At their home, evidence of a struggle and blood that has been messily cleaned up leave the police with little to no clues in regards to her whereabouts. The story slowly begins to unravel and the reader is taken on a roller coaster ride of whodunnit.<br /><br />I thought the novel was devious. It was my very own dirty little secret. Completely irredeemable characters with psychotic tendencies. I think that's what  kept me reading til the very end. Gillian Flynn really gave a bit of a glimpse into a killer's mind.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />http://nobodyputssarahinthecorner.com

B000F1IQNM|4.0|I laughed, and laughed.  This movie is good to watch for the whole family.  We all enjoyed it, and its sequel.
1781162646|5.0|This is a lovely story. Full of beauty, full of wonder, full of humanity. It put me in mind of what Bradbury might have written had he been a bit better at writing about grown-up people. It has that Bradburian sense of place (heck, it's about carnies; a Bradbury subject for sure) and nostalgic view of the past... But it's a worldly-wise nostalgia that is all King's own.<br /><br />That quality can also be found in what I think to be this story's closest relative, \\"Hearts In Atlantis,\\" in the collection of the same name. Like that story (which happens to be my favorite piece of his work), this book displays none of the mis-steps that King all too often makes: lapses in plotting; clunky metaphors and/or description; excessive grue when it's not appropriate; cheesy foreshadowing. The main characters are living, breathing humans about whom you truly care, and the writing presents them to you in such a way that you are effortlessly pulled along the stream of their lives during that long-ago autumn. It's just so good. :)<br /><br />The tone of the book makes an abrupt shift at the end: From mystery-infused coming-of-age sweetness to PURE PULP CLIMAX (!!) ... But King pulls it off beautifully. I think this is one of his most satisfying endings.<br /><br />So, all in all... If you like the more \\"literary\\" side of King (Hearts In Atlantis, Bag Of Bones, Duma Key, 11/22/63), this is most definitely for you. If you prefer the schlocky side (Under The Dome, Cell, Dreamcatcher)... You'll still be dragged along by the story, and very satisfied with the ending.<br /><br />So how can you go wrong? :)
B004PIA4BI|5.0|I love to have backup batteries to my favorite electronics.<br />The BST-41 is a decent battery and I have no issues<br />with my new one so far.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really have no idea what people are complaining about?! I loved this book!! I loved that Gideon and Eva were finally ale to talk out their issues like a normal couple , I loved that there was no drama that went on and on for to long , the ending didn't bother me at all because there was a happily ever now . There together as a couple and there good . There doesn't need to be an epilogue or a HEA because there is going to be another 2 books . Overall I loved it. And really liked how Gideon was so much more open with Eva in this book then he was I'm the past two

1416511946|5.0|I'm amazed Nikki Sixx is alive. I found the book somewhat inspirational for those who have family members addicted. Though not all will have  happy ending. This book is written differently than most auto-bios and maybe that's why I liked it so much.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It great but horrible at same time the train keep going fast when you have them boots you yet hit by jumping to hard and them block thing they have them 2x you go under and then jump over really? But other than that the game is tight and cool

B001P5M7QE|2.0|This is good for about the first five minutes, and after that it becomes increasingly boring. The gags are too simplistic and obvious. And I like Monty Python!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another excellent one. It was sizzling hot, with so much romance, which I love.  Hate the wait for the next book though.<br />---------<br />I find it amusing how other readers are stating that EWY was full of drama.  But I have read throughout these negative reviews and see more drama on those.  I don't see a problem with Ms. Day wanting to stretch the story and making money in the process. Last I checked, she is not doing this for charity.  Again, I can understand the disappointment about the story line, but not to the level that some readers have taken it.  Chill out, it's just a book and it's only 10 bucks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's a great app and fun and challenging. I like this app I strongly recommend it<br />Get it right now
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I'm another one of those people that doesn't write reviews unless the item is really good.  I've had this game for a while and got through the first 3 levels and wanted more.  When I found out there were 2 more levels I was happy and they didn't disappoint. The graphics on this are well done and the game is fun once you know what you need to do.  There is variety between each level but beware some levels are harder than others (or seem so) and it's not always the higher numbered levels that are the hardest.  This game makes you think about what order things need to be done in to get to the objective (covering all 3 stars).  I have had no trouble with the operation of the game but there have been a couple of levels that were really, really challenging and to get to the next level you have to at least get all the puddings to smush together.<br />At $.99 it is worth the money --> if it is the app of the day and FREE you are a fool to not try it.

0770437400|5.0|When I picked up World War Z, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the novel. What I found was so much more than just a recounting of a Zombie Apocalypse. I believe the acclaim that this novel has received is largely well-deserved. Brooks' \\"what-if\\" scenarios are well-thought out from sociological, psychological, and political points of view. The novel itself is structured as a journalistic account of a zombie epidemic which humanity barely survives, and at great cost. Each chapter is written like an interview with various witnesses of the War - and the characters are taken from a refreshing variety of roles and settings in the Zombie War. Although the characters are mostly allowed to tell their stories uninterrupted, I found the \\"interview\\" questions to sometimes be a little obvious and somewhat distracting, considering that the hypothetical interviewer, who is supposed to represent the average reader, can be a little naïve and obtuse. Aside from these minor distractions, the book can be seen as less of a zombie thriller, and more of a commentary on the current state of society and humanity set to the backdrop of impending extinction of the human race. As someone who has not generally been a fan of zombie lore, I would recommend this book to a general audience who just wants to stop, think, and reflect every couple of pages.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have thought long and hard if I should leave a review.<br />I won't say much about the book but I'd like to explain my four star rating even though most left less than three.<br />In all fairness,the book has stuck to the path I've imagined it would take after the cliff hanger ending of book two.<br />I do admit that new characters and new dramas where included which I thought was irrelevant considering this was a trilogy and as the third book supposed to tie all ends.<br />I bought this book straight after it came out as I've been hanging to read more of Gideon whom I've considered my fave fiction man.<br />I started reading the book and I noticed that the review and stars started to decline from four to two and a half. That caught my curiousity. After reading a few I did the ultimate no-no...  Skipped and started reading the last few chapters.<br />Guess what! Did do me any good as it just got me more curious as to what happened in between. So here I am re reading the book from the start. Now I have finally finished it and sure I agree with some comments and review.<br />But to give less than four stars is a bit harsh. The writing style is still the same. The characters strength and flaws are still consistent from book one to now. Then there are new characters and new drama, well I guess they were added as the intention of this serial was to extend further and introduce book four and five.<br />To me, reading this book answered a few questions and i also could accept that I am happy with some scene that I can say this could be the final book for me. It might not be the extreme happily ever after i have expected this would be but nonetheless it tied up a few loose ends in my opinion.<br />I was and still am a Gideon worshiper so I truly enjoyed everything this portrayed in this book.<br />The reason I gave this a four star as i was disappointed it didnt end. Just like everyone else, I was miss guided by the fact that this was supposed to be a trilogy. But knowingthere will be further two books... I am not sure if that will be the case or not. Who knows when book five is released further books will be added to this serial. That's just my opinion. A trilogy should stay a trilogy. There's only so much you can do or extend these type of sorties til you start to wear out the  characters and your readers.<br />To those who are still thinking of buying, don't let my opinion sway you or anyone else. If you loved X (Cross) from the very start, you will truly love him on this. I did.<br />But I have to think long and hard when the next book comes out. Forking $10 per e-book is a tad steep. Perhaps reduce the cost considering you've misled us with the trilogy series from the very start.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVED it!! But curious when the next installment will be out!!!! Can't wait to read more!!!! LOVE GIDEON AND EVA
B005M4K94G|5.0|The first recording was bought for 99 cents at South of The Border on our way to our Honeymoon in Florida in Jan of 1980. It kept us awake for the next 16 hours. Cassettes have since faded away and in the 1980's a CD was purchased. This has become the go to music for super relaxation, as we old folks called it, Head Music.<br /><br />If you love this version of Santana and have thought you listened to it with joy for years on end, you are a fool if you do not get the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs version.  Your hair will stand on end once again.  This is probably my 10th MoFi CD and even before that great definition Vinyl all way back to their beginning in 1977.<br /><br />If you know this album you are probably as old as I am.... late 50's.  You have heard it for a long time and the $30 some bucks will not break your bank account.  You have to have this.  I was going to write this track at this second sounds like the music it always should have sounded............<br /><br />It is just too awesome of a recording to miss out on.  Ordered 6/3/2013 on Amazon Prime.  Played 6/5/2013 and still playing.... OOOOHHHHHHH  the sweet music rendered in clarity.  Don't be a fool and pass this one up.  Mine is numbered 4104.... Don't know how many they made but don't miss this opportunity.
0446573027|5.0|David Baldacci is a excellent writer.  On top of that I was happy with the quality of the book I received and when I received it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game is fun and addictive. Once you complete all the puzzles it is just about the coin increase. I am level 188 and almost 8000 coins. So no it is just a great time waster when I am bored.  Hopefully game circus will update it again and give us more puzzles to complete. The lack of puzzles is the only reason I considered 3 stars.
0670034711|5.0|A very good book about working through relationship issues and learning to take care of self and liking yourself for who you are.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Fun and easy game. I wish it was a free play and lives weren't restored for continuous use....but all in all fun game!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Another puzzle art work game from zeptolab. The puzzles are amusing and funny. Great game to kill some time and practice the mind.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Amazingly accurate book on understanding day to day male/female interactions. Some of the conversations he used as an example were verbatim from conversations and arguments I've had with my boyfriend. Absolutely a MUST read for either gender. I feel like I've learned a lot!
B002KKCVY6|4.0|I love the brand Teva and have always had good luck with them.  I bought this particular pair because I needed a new set and this particular style was on a very good sale.<br /><br />I normally wear a 13.5 - I bought these in a 13, and these fit fairly well.<br /><br />They are a bit stiffer, both the insole and the straps, than other Tevas I've owned.  That's the only reason I didn't rate them a 5.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is entertaining and easy to learn. Definitely worth a try if you like hidden object games. Will definitely play again.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|you need to keep up the good work you did great I love how you made this it's epic keep it up
1476733953|5.0|To me, the best stories are those set in a world completely foreign to my own. A world constructed by the author in a believable way. Hugh Howey did this masterfully. I was hooked from the beginning (which was offered as a free, short-story eBook) and quickly ordered the paperback. The first section was reminiscent of Vonnegut's 2BR02B, but set in a future, dystopian world. Then it takes off in a completely new direction. I loved every minute of this story and recommend it highly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this app! It's one of the best ones I've ever played,but it updated on my iPod and not on here? What's up?
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I started with the trial version, and feel in love with it. For me the purchase of the full version is worth every penny.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are wonderful in every scene they share.  I really liked this movie, it had a good plot with twists and turns and I enjoyed every minute of it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the first two books, and was so looking forward to this one, but a gut feeling told me to read reviews first, and I'm so glad I did. There is no way I'm gonna purchase the book now that the series has been unnecessarily extended.<br /><br />I'm only writing this review so that the author knows how many readers she is losing with this series extension. And it bothered me to no end that the kindle price is even higher than paperback. Such a shame, Sylvia Day is a really good author that has been talked into making really bad business decisions. As for this series, which I thought was so much better than 50 Shades, I'm really Done with You.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Great story, great acting...love Bill Nighy, he's wonderful and James McAvoy?  Well, he is smart as hell!  Love his character in this.  Very enjoyable British series!  They are SO GOOD at these!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I have had so many problems with this app from losing my cash, to land that was purchased and now it is not accessible! I have been working with gameloft for 4 months to straighten this out. At first they were going to send me the &#34;cash&#34; replacement but never received it, they said it was a softwar issue and they are working on it! The game itself is very addicting and a lot of fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you saw the first two season, get ready for season 4 by watching season three.  Have your owned marathon.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I like the other two books of this series but I really, really hate this one. First of all, the series was supposed to be trilogy, but it's NOT! The story continues to the next series (big bummer). The story line went around and around and around with too much unnecessary information, so boring! the sex scenes were too long (too much) and less focus on Eva and Gideon but more to other characters. Basically, it didn't live up to my expectation at all. Totally disappointed =(
B0057LUI0O|4.0|Since purchasing this movie, I've watched it several times. There's some great comedy in this animated flick and some  poignant moments as well. Very vivid and colorful family friendly film.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A must read for anyone living in the free world. It will open your heart and mind to a human rights issue that much of the world isn't aware of.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is the first book written by Stieg Larsson that I've read. The drama and mystery through out the book is captivating. I am looking forward to reading other books by Larsson. I highly recommend the book.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I wanted to see this in 3D at the theater, but didn't get a chance.  However, I managed to see it and loved it!  This version is the best way to experince this great movie!  If a sequel is ever made, I have no intention of missing it!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I would really give it 4.75 stars because the ending was a little abrupt, but it was one of the best books of the series.  It was different, but I liked the difference.  I felt the previous book in the series tried to revisit every couple and I found that tiresome.  So I did not miss that the changelings had a small role in the book.  I liked the mystery of the unknown identity of the female main character.  I liked the intensity of the relationship between the two main characters.  I liked the partial redemption of Kaleb.  What a twist...taking an assumed bad guy and making him a hero.  I was not disappointed, but was instead delighted by the twist of this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out so I could finally see how Eva's and Giedon story ended and now it looks like there will be a fourth book etc!!!!! Good thing I love me some Giedon Cross. The connection between Eva and Giedon in this book was of the charts hot!!!!!  The things he said to her gave me butterflies..lol...So many things were left unexplained I hope we get all the answers and the happy ending in the next book. What are you waiting for buy and read today you will not regret it.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is like the computer or handheld game 20q, only this game deals strictly with people. Its extremely we'll executed and has managed to guess my celebrities extremely accurately. I did trip it up twice with lesser known artists, but to the programmers credit, I was trying.  Great fun as a time killer or parlour trick at a party. I downloaded it because it was free, but I'm keeping it because it's awesome.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They need to hurry up and come out with the next season!!  Love it!!  Very addicting.... a different kind of drama
B0037272K4|4.0|I heard about A.Avidan through a remix of his &#34;Reckoning Song&#34; by Wankelmut and discovered that it was actually an acoustic song. I liked it very much and searched for this band. It turned out to be this rock group from Israel which had a very charismatic singer, who reminds me of Jack White especially when he uses falsetto.<br /><br />The songs are very &#34;easy-listening&#34;: middle tempo rock n roll and lots of acoustic guitars. The thing which makes it great is the fact that it's not an average album: it contains a lot of interesting musical ideas (also peculiar ones) in a very popular context.
B004P8ITGU|3.0|I thought it was written for teenagers. It was reasonable but compared to Grisham's other books not what I expected.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Holy crap!!!! This was twisting and turning at every moment. My jaw dropped on multiple occasions. Oh my God I just can't handle this.... such an amazing storyline and put to life so well by Sylvia Day. I can't wait to read more!!!
B00BU18U82|4.0|I think the game is fun, and realistic but it needs to have multi-player and there needs to be animals, pedestrians, and the cars need to stop when you are trying to pull out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this calculator to be simple yet very effective. The buttons are convenient and easy to use. That about sums it up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You get to be creative have fun and even play with friends. I love it. If u like to be creative u will love this app
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so addicting and entertaining; yet its SOOO SIMPLE!!!! I totally recommend the game especially since its FREEEEEE now!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climb racing it's awesome if you don't have it GET I T NOW I'M TELLING YOU I love it
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The physics are a ton of fun, and the variety of vehicles and maps keeps it interesting. The forest level is hilarious. And it's a free game that's actually free; unlike many &quot;free&quot; games in which you reach a wall and can't go farther without buying some weapon or whatever, you earn plenty of in-game-currency just by playing the game and trying to beat your own scores. Excellent game. 10/10 would play again (and again).
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great story. Love everything about it. Keep up the great work. Man, I can't wait to start the next volume!!!!
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|Had to force myself to continue reading it. Couldn't really feel the emotion.  Too many names of mountain ranges. Not sure how that played into the plot!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|It was a birthday present and they loved it. It is their favorite tv series to watch so it was an easy gift.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am giving this book a one star as the storyline was dragged as a filler for TWO additional books to this trilogy. S. Day has let  her Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell fans down ... This book does NOT provide the HEA that so many of us have anticipated after such a LOOOOONG wait.<br />******************SPOILER ALERT******************<br />The book begans where Bared To You ends Eva has just left Gideon's apartment with the reality of knowing he has killed for her, now the two of them secretly rendezvous while waiting out the pending murder investigation.  In the meanwhile Eva does not share this with her BFF Cary therefore straining their tight knit friendship as Cary is on to her that she's holding back with events in her life.  Gideon is dealing with the pathetic Corrine who just can't move on from him now that she sees he's actually capable of loving. Oh and let's not forget the scorned reporter who is just ADAMANT in revealing to the world how selfish and jerkish Gideon Cross WAS pre-Eva. Although Nathan is no longer alive he continues to bring MORE drama in Eva's life.  Eva's poor poor mother and her control issues STILL continues and due to an INCIDENT her and Eva's relationship is more strained.  The details of Gideon's past are unraveled further but not truly resolved. This book was allllll over the place the last chapter was very frustrating with all the last minute twists n turns OH and the ONE major announcement that seemed MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS BOOK was not truly officially made it put a damper on the actual action and we the readers were not fully able to enjoy that FACTOR as it seems to still be a half told secret to NOT ALL of the MAIN characters I personally did not understand the need for its discretion :(<br />I agree with previous reviewers that Eva does not seem to appreciate Gideon as she should and I am TRULY lost as to why she would even care to entertain Brett even as a FRIEND he is definitely tooooo little toooo late!<br />At this time I am not sure if I will buy the next 2 books although I am eager to find how the story ends. But at the rate Mrs. Day is going I am a little worried it just might not be the happily ever after that we soooo think Eva and Gideon deserve. DISAPPOINTED IN YOU!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the real deal and don't buy the copies and crap; if I were you I would only buy minecraft and survvalcraft.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is a gift for my grandaughter I hope she likes them both and this will not hinder my opinion in any way
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This is supposed to be fantasy. This series is filled with gritty details that test the limits of what is comfortable reading concerning gory stuff and also contains episodes of soft porn!<br /><br />Mr. Martin likes to get the reader to invest in characters and then kill them off. Once or twice could be acceptable but it seems that ALL his characters must be killed off or left in catch 22 situations. I read the entire Song of Ice and Fire series and came away with complete dissatisfaction. How Martin came to receive such hype and accolades, I don't know but I wouldn't recommend this series at all to anyone!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Gave this app a look after reading about it on Reddit.  Extremely fun to play especially if you have a warped sense of humor like I do.  Cook up new killer organisms, viruses, parasites, etc. and release them to (hopefully) take out EVERY LIVING HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET.  Who wouldn't enjoy this kinda fun?  LOL

B000OVLBFS|5.0|I really liked this one because it was the first in the series and deserved to be to be the first.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|Loved everything from the first scene to the last... the swordmanship, the deadly assassins & non-stop action. Recommend to all who enjoy Japanimation/Anime.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|It is a little too light on believable Police work. It relies too much on cop-ply intuition and not enough on actual evidence. The female deputy actually was more believable.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 5 year has every monster high doll and this movie made her collection even more valuable to her heart.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Star Wars I love it when it first came out and its still on of my favorite movies that I could watch all 6 movies all in a row.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Very satisfied with action, actors, comedy. Love to watch over and over again. Im a 70's baby so all the action stars made my day!
B0034G4P94|4.0|I got this for my husband, he says it is a great movie and would recommend. Arrived in stately fashion which is what i love.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Great film to watch over and over again. I thought it was hilarious. Have not laughed so hard since the first one!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my daughter, she loves these movies very much, highly recommend. Love  how quickly movies arrive.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|All three Batman in this series is great! This one is a great ending full of surprises and satisfactions, will watch over and over again.
1400052181|5.0|Amazing true tale of the origins of the HeLa cells and the family of the woman they came from. Well written, clear and compassionate. Truly a fantastic read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this for free and very happy with the game. It is very easy to use and fun for all ages. I love the bonus content of videos when you build the theater. The one downfall to this game is the notifications are very very annoying and cumbersome at times. At one point in six hours I had eight notifications from the game.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|in spite of the huge cast of characters the narrative. remains captivating. I loved the detailed descriptions of the worlds in which the events take place
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Once again Tarantino hits a home run while tackling a tough subject. it's hard to believe, but this movie is better than the greatness of Inglorius Bastards.  Quinten is a master of character development and gets more out of his actors than any other director.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was captivating and exciting . I loved the concept, although it was a bit far fetched. But, then it is fiction. Just did not like the way it ended. I did like the twists and turns - that kept me reading every minute I had.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It has a lot of adds and very single time an add pops up but otherwise this game is a lot of fun and addicting it is a great way to entertain kids
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Puzzles are interesting and just complicated enough to keep you playing and not totally frustrate you. Can't wait for more rooms.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you were going to get a game. This is one you should get.I love playing solitaire games.and if you play lots of card games you'll like this one also.
1449437524|5.0|I have loved the Oatmeal for a long time and this is one of his best works for me. I have purchased this for several other dog owners and they all find it very nice and funny.
0061564893|5.0|Some other researchers now pick apart some of his assumptions/conclusions, but I still think he has raised doubts in the order of contact with the New Worlds, Australia and Antarctica as well. Fortunate confluence of knowledge and interests t in the author o be able to eek out a long forgotten part of our human heritage.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. The characters are vibrant and the stories so touching. The way Asha connects to her family and how her own family reconnects is brilliant.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Soooooo many unanswered questions.... Where to even begin. Well, I really can't, to be honest, because anything I have to say will give away major spoilers. Just know that I LOVED it, and other than all the unanswered questions, I don't understand why everyone is so pissed. As much as I would have loved for it to be wrapped up, I don't feel like she is stringing us along. There is definitely enough storyline to fill 5 books, and none of it is fluff. I will follow that woman wherever she wants to take us ;-) Just please don't make us wait too long.... Throw us a bone or something ;-)
B004LROUNG|5.0|I read this book in 4 days and could not put it down. Great characters, almost all flawed in some way. Wish the main character wasn't so damn perfect, though. Haha.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is pretty good. I got it free for the app of the day. I will say that if you are looking for a pudding simulation, you will be disappointed. Nothing can beat real pudding. However, for a puzzler, this game is smooth and a great time killer. Kudos to the devs.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show.  I watched the 1st season in a week the second one I'm working on now!  :))  Keeps you guessing!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Well!  This was a great addition to the series, I loved catching up with Cary and Trey plus Tatiana.  Eva's boss Mike and his hunky boyfriend Stephen, so pleased for them, and I hope they don't think Eva and Gideon stole their thunder.<br /><br />Oh my what a mess between Eva and her mother, but love how the story is going between her and her dad.<br /><br />Corinna needs to stay away, she is beginning to get on my nerves now!  Get back with her own husband who clearly loves her.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon just get better and better, how much does their love show.  And how intense its got.  So loving their journey.<br /><br />Oh my Brett is going to have a tough time accepting that Eva is totally head over heels in love with gideon , hope he's going to be man enough about it.<br /><br />Don't like the abrupt ending, but it does make it better knowing we ain't finished yet.<br /><br />The smexy scenes OMG hot hot hot!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I say decent because it is boring at the begining took a bit to get the idea of it - then it did turn around and had a good finish.  Be prepared to be bored for the 1st 20 minutes then you will enjoy the rest of it.  Great finish :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Eva and Gideon are on fire in this book best one so far I love Eva and Gideon's relationship they are truly the best book couple ever can't wait for the next one :)

B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I'd like to preface my review of this album with the following statement:<br />Layne Staley was a part of this band's roots and is remembered by the rest of the band and their fans, and the same goes for bassist Mike Starr.  Sean Kinney has their initials on his bass drum, for anyone who was unsure what LSMS meant when you see new live videos.  It serves no purpose to criticize them for continuing their career and basically the only life they've known.  Reviews of this album shouldn't be based on anything but the music itself.  That being said, thank you to those who gave honest and respectful critical reviews.<br /><br />Moving on, this is the 2nd album from the current lineup of Alice In Chains, featuring original members Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney, along with bassist Mike Inez and singer/guitarist William DuVall.  My first impression of this new album is that it sounds like a natural progression from \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" and now that this lineup has found their identity they were able to push themselves more this time around.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Hollow\\" reminds me of \\"Grind\\" from their 1995 self-titled album, and right from the first notes, Jerry's signature sound comes through.  The 2nd song \\"Pretty Done\\" reminds me of \\"Lesson Learned\\" from the last album in its pacing and style, but also sounds a bit more like Jerry's solo work.  Of course, being the lead guitarist/vocalist and songwriter means his solo work is going to mirror AIC's tone so that's not a bad thing.  Track 3 \\"Stone\\" is among my very favorite songs on this album, it starts incredibly heavy and just keeps climbing with interesting changes throughout.  Again, since this album kind of picks up where \\"BGWTB\\" left off, I hear similarities in the songs on both, and the main guitar riff from Stone reminds me of \\"Check My Brain\\".  Tracks 4 and 5, \\"Voices\\" and the title track, show of the harmonizing between Jerry and William over acoustic guitars, and the spacial effect of the title track makes me think of the \\"Sap\\" EP.  Track 6, \\"Lab Monkey\\" is the song I just cannot stop listening to, love it!  To me, that kind of track is undeniably signature AIC, like \\"Acid Bubble\\" from BGWTB.<br /><br />Tracks 7-9 are good, not the best on the album, although track 8 \\"Breath On A Window\\" to me feels almost like a \\"Dirt\\" b-side in the best way.  Things pick up again for track 10 \\"Phantom Limb\\" and that's where the best of the album stops for me.  Track 11 \\"Hung on a Hook\\" is my least favorite song on the album for no other reason than I feel it just doesn't fit.  The closing track is good, but I think had that one been moved up and the title track was the closer it would have been a more cohesive set.<br /><br />As much as I loved BGWTB, especially for the hauntingly beautiful title track, I feel like they took what worked on the last album and built on it and did a great job.  If I can take a rest from \\"Lab Monkey\\" long enough to enjoy the whole album I'm sure I'll love it more with each listen.  I can understand why Jerry said he could be happy if this ended up being their last album.  It's a very strong album, and it's evident that it was made as an album, not just a collection of songs; there is a distinction there.  Another reviewer said it perfectly, this is \\"Grunge\\" for adults, not angsty teens.  This music has the attitude and grit of the music that teenagers like, but with a maturity to it that comes from decades of playing music together, which makes it odd that people would expect that to stop, or even want it to.ck makes me think of the \\"Sap\\" EP.  Track 6, \\"Lab Monkey\\" is the song I just cannot stop listening to, love it!  To me, that kind of track is undeniably signature AIC, like \\"Acid Bubble\\" from BGWTB.<br /><br />Tracks 7-9 are good, not the best on the album, although track 8 \\"Breath On A Window\\" to me feels almost like a \\"Dirt\\" b-side in the best way.  Things pick up again for track 10 \\"Phantom Limb\\" and that's where the best of the album stops for me.  Track 11 \\"Hung on a Hook\\" is my least favorite song on the album for no other reason than I feel it just doesn't fit.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Either way, you should load your disc, pick 'Shadow of the Colossus' and lay back a bit, as it all starts \\"right\\" from there..<br />The first string plays as the intro cinematic and choir starts. First few ten seconds, brief silence synchronizes perfectly with scenes. I knew it right there this must be something very special.<br />The intro continues to impress me, the entrance to the forbidden land, the contrast between the two, the first view of the great bridge (I can't help but think how on earth could anything build such thing of this scale, even with today technology).<br /><br />This large land is lifeless, yet beautiful in its way. You can go almost everywhere right after the start with your best and only companion, a horse named Agro. No music will ever play on your way to the Colossus, this emphasizes solitude atmosphere even further. Worry not you won't miss the way (often) as your sword will mostly shows it, wherever sunlight can touch it.<br /><br />Riding Agro is much more like riding a horse (than any other games). You can kick him to run forward, steer left or right, slow down or stop (you can even do several stunts). But you cannot simply use Analog Stick to control his direction or speed directly (as in most other games). This could be annoying at times (to get him do exactly what you want). Why wouldn't the game developer just let you control the horse directly (much simpler that way)?  A well thought reason there is.. you will be experiencing this whole world from the protagonist's sole perspective, exactly by design. This way, Agro in your perception will be truly your sidekick, he will annoy you several times, yet many others he will save your ass, and get the job done perfectly. During your quest, you will perceive Agro's loyalty and various emotions, e.g. fear of height, frightened by the Colossus, joy of running at you. You will feel his bravery and strength as you steer him full speed toward gigantic Colossus. You will feel that he is really alive -- never just a lifeless vehicle as you may have felt in any games. Worth to mention that Agro's animation is very best I have seen in video games.<br /><br />The Colossi are definitely the best parts, each of us will have our own favorite(s), yet they're all unique, impressive, and deeply memorable. The area inhabited by each Colossus almost guarantee a \\"Wow\\" too. The first encounter scene for each Colossus is priceless. Gigantic appearance (compliment by epic soundtrack) mostly left you in awe, fear, sometimes despair -- how on earth am I suppose to take it down? or even to get on to it? Fear not, you will. Once you figure it out from trials and errors, the music will be changed to a different more cheerful yet epic soundtrack, e.g. The Opened Way. It confirms that you're turning the tide against the Colossus. Striking the final blow thus taking it down, however, gives a weird mix of great achievement, sad, and guilty. Why have these Colossi to be killed? Is this really the right thing to do? Who am I and the girl for that matter? Several answers lie in the end, just probably not the ones you expect though.<br /><br />Final words:  Top notch art direction, graphics, soundtrack and truly emotional best experience are what 'Shadow of the Colossus' has to offer.<br /><br />note:  actually Agro is female, in Ueda's (the game director) vision. It doesn't matter however, as this game leaves you interpret most aspects by yourself.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|It does what it is supposed to do, but there is a bit of a learning curve and it is not as repeatable as I would expect.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Really a fun book. A huge love letter to growing up in the 80's. do yourself a favor if this is you.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've haven waited so long for this book and then am left completely hanging...I gave 5 stars because I love the story but there was not much to this one but sex after sex with these two.<br />So many unanswered questions, how long do we have to wait now!!! Ugh
B005UG542S|2.0|I am familiar with the books, so the liberties taken in Part 2 spoiled the parts that were done well.  The final battle and sequence of many events were totally fabricated even though Voldy came to an end.  Harry breaking the wand?  Please, it was the last straw.  I won't watch this again even for free. I'll have to reread a few of the books to get the taste out of my mind.
B0002ZXCY4|3.0|I had great expectations for this album - I had heard a lot about it and knew that it was an extra-dimensional space opera (which is the best kind of opera IMO :D). Additionally, an impressive cast of musicians and vocalists were assembled to bring this saga to life. The songs are all solid.So why the 3 star rating? The Voice/Narrator. The Statements this character makes detract from the listening experience, and breaks up the flow of the songs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't put this game down. It challenges my mind, keeps my fingers busy, and is fun beyond words! Totally recommend it!
B00BG23LYS|5.0|Fantastic riffage, sophisticated melody and a haunting narrative - what more can you ask for? I thought their last LP (Blood Lust) was great, however they really took their music up to another level with this record.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Just so you know, I watched \\"Expendables 2\\" just to give it a shot because some folks told me the first one was good even though I thought it was an insult to my intelligence, gender, sanity, physical well being, and all things in this dimension of reality.<br /><br />The verdict? While not NEARLY as insulting as the first one and possessing of something sort of resembling a plot, it was not a good movie. If the first one got zero stars this one would get 1.5 - 2. At least there was effort made this time. One thing to beware of, every single joke Schwarzenegger makes falls flatter than steam rolled sheets. The other guys aren't exactly funny at any point, but they pass for having the basic requisites for being human.<br /><br />If I complain about everything wrong with the movie we will be here all day, so I'll just tell you my favorite part. The best part of the movie, hands down, is when Chuck Norris shows up. It's clever, it's funny, and it really hams up the \\"Chuck Norris Jokes\\" you see online. If nothing else, that was worth the price of the DVD rental.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|There's a reason why the Beatles top every music lover's BEST LIST. When this album was made I wasn't even born. Still genius production values. Still genius writing. Its still all good. Don't believe me? Need proof? Try listening to a Justin Bieber CD some forty years from now and see if it still holds up. I'll wait for your reply.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye is and always will be the best poet of our time.  His ability to create music was truly a God given talent.  No one,<br />absolutely no one can match him when it comes to an insight into how music is forever changing and how he was able to keep<br />up with all of it.  No one has been or no one will be like him.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book was great I wish the ending had been different but I am really excited this story will continue I LOVE Eva and Gideon as well as Cary. I do hope I don't have to wait as long as I did for the next book. Also love the fact that Sylvia Day doesn't skip years down the road I love that she keeps the story going on from day to day!!!!  I will never get tired of reading their story and the twist and turns that come up in this relationship.
B008BP1MVC|5.0|This is an amazing album and even better on vinyl. The record is pristine and comes with album art and a sleeve for the record that has the lyrics to all the tracks written by Lianne herself. In short, its awesome. Get the vinyl.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use! Great for doing my budget! I don't need to search for a calculator in the junk drawer anymore.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|One of those movies we can just watch over and over again. The aircraft carrier and flight scenes, with their accompanying high-energy musical soundtrack, are just amazing! The romantic storyline is fun, and the primary plot development of Maverick's character is one of those &#34;overcoming your personal demons&#34; stories that is encouraging, with a happy ending.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book kept you intrigued and it was written so that you could picture what was going on in the story. If you love horses you will love this book!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 seasons of Fringe ... one of the most creative and complex shows we've seen in recent years, it always had us talking afterwards and eagerly looking forward to the next episode. Fun, intellectual, good writing weaving together a long-term unfolding story-line. A bit gory at times, especially if Walter was doing an autopsy in the lab (!), but it always kept us intrigued. The final Season 5 was not so good, would have been better if they had wrapped up Season 4 as the ending of the series. Still great to watch the old episodes on DVD ... we've watched the whole series twice now, and it is still great entertainment!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so wanting this book to be as good as the other two,especially when your paying 9.99 for the book. I love the character's and kept waiting for something to happen.....nothing. And now there is going to be another book. Thought this was a trilogy? Very disappointed.
B0015AARJI|5.0|No special comment needed here. This controller is the real thing.  The analog works, the charging works in legit packaging.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved book 1& 2 but this one was definitely a sexathon please tell me who has the strength or inclination to keep up with these two? Enough is enough...go out to eat or to a movie for a change, at least that would have made the story a little more realistic and less \\"repetitive\\". Not that much else happened in their lives that couldn't have been written in 75 pages. I'm addicted to Eva and Gideon and really waited for this book to be released but nearing the end when I realized I will have to wait ENDLESSLY for book 4 of this TRILOGY (ha ha) to be released, I was a bit annoyed. Sylvia has made me rethink my decision of downloading ANY trilogies before all 3 books are written and available. Trilogies in general are a pain In the Tush to begin with...writers are getting greedy.In regards to this particular review, I am giving it a 4 and that is being generous ONLY because of my fondness of these 2 characters. The next book better complete the Nathan issue, the old boyfriend drama, moms cheating heart and the Corrine problems or I'll be crossing Sylvia Day off my readers list. Hope all the reviews written by her fans get read and make a difference in the content of her 4th and hopefully final installment of the Crossfire SERIES!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. It was long enough to be interesting but it didn't drag on too long. Worth every penny!
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|They said it was suppose to be a medley of the songs he sang on Jimmy Kimbel.  So far I haven't heard a one.  Not happy with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok love this app its so fun love it so much everyone should everyone should play it all the time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The twist at the end was unexpected and did not see it coming.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|This is a very well done X men movie based on Stan Lee's Marvel characters. The movie is dynamic throughout no real dull moments. The characters are genuine and credible, except for Sabertooth's look which can be described as a homeless biker with hair extensions. I also didn't care too much about the dark X Men Uniforms but it is a believeable adaptation for a modern day movie. I enjoyed the inside joke about the yellow spandex on board the blackbird but I personally would liked to have seen a movie version of wolvarine's classic costume...In this regard I have to give five stars to Super Man movies.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Keeps me and my Adult ADHD... huh, what was the question again. No really though at least unlike candy crush I don't have to pay or link it up to my facebook to move on!
0689835604|3.0|We don't live in the same town, so I'm not sure about this book. He seemed to like it when I gave it to him, but now he is walking and playing with other toys. Still loves books and like most children he has his favorites.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Fine acting.  Great scenery.<br />Lots of action.  Very realistic.<br />Felt present in the movie.  Could really relate with Elizabeth I.
0671449028|4.0|Cute concept and my grandson seems to enjoy it. He will bring me several books to read when I visit and this is one of them.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Shows great courage, incredible flexibility and creativity on the part of the boy realistically shipwrecked at sea with wild animals.<br />Beautiful scenery.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I've always LOVED these types of games, and this one is awesome. Doesn't require Internet or money to play. I've whiled away endless quiet hours at work with this game. Also, you can play on for HOURS. It's not one of those games where you play for 5 minutes doing the same 5 things and have to put it away until you have more in-game energy or jewels or coins. Excellent game that focuses on the player and not the developer's wallet.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another awesome book tell the end... Crossfire series is my favorite books by far.. What is sad is the ending to the first two were great but not the last.... All I got to say is there better be book 4....
B00847KFDS|5.0|I'm not one for recording artists going back and re-doing their hit songs.......BUT this album is totally different. John Fogerty and crew have done a masterful job in bringing a newness and freshness to his hits of the past that I didn't think even possible. The cuts on this CD really surprised me.......I would have never thought &#34;Bad Moon Rising&#34; (one of my favs from the CCR days) could ever sound this good in a different format and approach, while retaining its roots in the original issue. And the sons of Fogerty, along with Dad, really do a superb job on &#34;Lodi&#34;. In fact, there is not a weak or bad cut on this CD. Highly recommended.....this album should really go up the charts!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this app. I like that we can actually take care of the horse. I just wish we could have an option of what we want our first horse to be
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game but I got to level 50 and had everypony and all shops but then the game got to big for my kindle lost ALL progress and am very sad. :(
1432794426|5.0|I have not read this book as of yet; however I have heard so many great things about Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy, written by Dr. Karen Moriarty--a book that explains, vindicates, and celebrates Michael Jackson!<br />Thomas A. Mesereau [MJ's defense attorney] endorses this book:<br />&#34;If you want an eye-opening portrayal of the real Michael Jackson -<br />delivered in a rare blend of disclosure, respect, insight, and passion - this is it!&#34; That statement and the title alone caught my attention on wanting to order this book about &#34;The King Of Pop&#34; Michael Jackson.. As a child--oldest of six children and parents not being able to afford to buy posters or magazines for me as a child-- I had a desire to learn more growing up about M.J. but never had the chance; now I do . Michael Jackson was a proud man from things I have read so far in Dr. Karen Moriarty's postings on her Facebook site. Knowing his passion to please his fans and bring more to the earth, Dr. Karen Moriarty shows that M.J. truly loved children of this world. I for one will never believe the gossip people say about him!!!! He was humble and spent money he made for children less fortunate and visited sickly children in the hospital. Yes, Michael Jackson was a great man. I believe all of his fans love him and miss him . I am honored to buy this book by Dr. Karen Moriarty. I truly believe she had a great insight into the King of Pop, like she knew the big star not only by his fame but his soul as a person. Will write more after I read the book.... From a fan most excited beyond belief !!!!!!! “I shall highly recommend this book for all Michael Jackson fans.&#34; &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; Lora
B0073RQMBY|5.0|My son loves it but he plays with the Spinosarus and T-rex more, maybe because the size of this Velociraptor is smaller. I think I should buy 2-3 more velociraptor for him since Velociraptor always hunt in group. I really like the shape, size and durability of this dinosaurs, and its face is very cruel, which is the things I like most.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I have it for Xbox and pc too. But I'm frustrated that the update has come out for the iPod and not the kindle fire, what the heck ? I'm really disappointed
B0073QNIH6|4.0|My son loved it and I think it is a great toy. The detail, color and size are perfect. But his face is a bit good-nature and I think it should be more cruel, since I know Allosaurus is a very ferocious dinosaurs. Beside, its jaw is a bit smaller than the others (T-rex, Giganotosaurus), so it is difficult to eat some prey (in my son's game), haha. However we are also satisfy with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think its worth the money and really cool! its also fun! u will enjoy it theres tons of updates.
B0073QYC2G|4.0|I don't thing there are much improvement for this Dinosaurs Figure, the only thing I am not happy with it is that the neck and the head of the Ginganotosaurus are not straight with his body, so my son have some difficulty to make the Giganotosarus and the T-rex fight together. However the appearance and durability are great and excellent. The size is also match perfectly with the others dinosaurs such as T-rex.
B008393Q2O|3.0|This was a free app of the day so I gave it a try.  It's not one that I will use.  I was comparing it to the Color Notes app on my phone and wanted to see if this one would let me be better organized.  Its an ok app but I'm sticking to Color Notes.
B0073RSVMC|4.0|Overall we (Me and my son) love it. The size, appearance and durability have nothing to complain, just say they are great, The only thing that should be improved is the color of the T-rex. Personally I don't think the bright green color is the best for this T-rex. However this is still a great Figure for Dinosaurs-loved people.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This was a free app of the day.  I've got other timers on my phone but this one beats them.  I have used this numerous times since downloading.  Comes in hand for just about everything! I'm giving it 5 stars because I like it.
B00004U8P9|5.0|A great B style movie that is packed full of laughter and silliness, with great stars just begining their career's.
1451695195|4.0|This is a very inspiring book, but not as good as &#34;To Heaven & Back&#34;, which I had just finished.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game and I think you should buy it because it costs only 7.00 ! Like I said minecraft is awesome and I really think you should buy it
B00BI745AA|5.0|5 Star all the way. Worth watching. Even my husband enjoyed it. The acting and music were great and worth it.
B003O5MO6G|4.0|This is the final Byrd's recording that had all of the original members, except Gene Clark, who (in my opinion) was never driven to be a Byrd. He left early in the group's career, but they did not seem to suffer his loss.<br /><br />McGuinn still excelled at that Rickenbacker 12-string, playing lead lines that anyone can recognize. The wonderful surprise for me, was the emergence of Chris Hillman, as a major force. After his career as a bluegrass mandolin player, taking up the bass guitar was the best thing he ever did! Nobody was playing rock/country bass the was Chris did, and I loved every note.<br /><br />Very very good album.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I searched around for an app that would be good for my 3 yr old autistic daughter. I came across this one and was intrigued. I purchased it for my Kindle Fire. My daughter absolutely loves this app. She gets excited when she gets things right and gets to go to the next page, it keeps her mind busy and she loves doing the puzzles.
B000002J0P|5.0|What can I say? The purity of this music has stood the test of time. It is so easy to hear the differences between songwriters. Each song, for example, written by Stills--sounds like a Stills song. Nash's style is also immediately recognizable, and so is Crosby's. These men were young, energetic, full of joy, and their music has brought me a ton of pleasure.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The special effects and the gritty performance of Naomi Watts are the stars of the movie.  Those who love happy endings will be pleased.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put it down. An unexpected but logical end.  Family relations  very profoundly detailed. Really<br />Liked the novel. I recommend it if you like legal thrillers.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It is a good game, however it requires alot of patience. More of a check in maybe twice a day or so to breed, hatch, collect, etc.
B004VB3V0K|5.0|Haskell is a very intriguing language and very different from the traditional procedural approaches used in the most popular languages (including most Object Oriented languages). This book offers a gentle introduction to FP using Haskell. The author explains topics very clearly and uses many examples which the reader can run themselves.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This Book is amazing, it lives up to all the other Diary Of A Wimpy Kid books, which is a big accomplishment! So worth it
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia does what  she does best. Making & bringing us beautiful music? I have been a fan of hers since she first came on the music scene,,,,. love her.....
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played.you should so play this game it's cool. you can earn points to get armor.we'll iron man armorial.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Music keeps u movin.great dance workout, love Pitbull.It is a great album, he excels at what he does best. Giving great music to his fans......
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I've always gone with &#34;the book is better than the movie&#34;.  This proves it to be absolutely true.  And how!
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Please, I beg of you. You don't know how to write good music anymore. You are old, wrinkly and your voice sounds dull and dry and monotone. It is so painful listening to each album you put out through the years after Rust in Peace. You have lost your way. It's like watching somebody wander off into the forest.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|An exciting story and very unpredictable.  Many things happened that I did not expect. The characters are all very interesting.
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|This album felt more mainstream as if the band ran out of juice and creativity.  It's the same sound samples with a good guitar riff with solid drums.  I wish it were better but it's too polished for me without \\"ear candy\\" of riffs, vocals and drums.  I prefer earlier AIC and Jerry's solo releases.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I loved the depth this book had when it came to character development and plot points. Although, this was a little too focused on the political aspects of WWI and woman's suffrage, I still felt enlightened by how extensive a reach politics really did have during that point in history.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A hero in every sense of the word, as are many others. God bless our military men and women. To hell with a commander in chief who doesn't acknowledge a military that salutes him as he walks by!
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|this movie had me from thee word play it was exciting and edge of your seat action its a real who done it for the people involed on thee elevator but the veiwer knows from the jump that its the devil satan the evil one or what ever you call hin the only other one that seems to even have a clue is the spanish security gaurd and he is pretty well up to date on the prince of darkness thanks to his mother and grand mother.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Maybe some of the governmental &#34;higher ups&#34; should read this. They would appreciate our men and women a little more
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to my other Willie Nelson CDs. The sound quality and choice of songs is simply wonderful.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very nice bag with plenty of storage. I am currently able to fit my camera (Nikon D40x) with 50 1.8 and lens hood, 85 1.8, 18-105, Nikon D100, 18-55, 50 1.8D, Black Rapid RS 7 Strap, and still have room for one more lens. All of my other camera items fit nicely in the front pocket including two chargers. The straps have a lot of padding to them and it seems like this would be very comfortable to wear all day. As my camera collection grows I may have to get a bigger bag but this fits everything I own currently in an easy to access backpack.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|this is the best trailxtreme yet. it has diffrent bikes to unlock. dress up the driver. And awesome obsticals.  love it. @
B005TBN3EU|3.0|It was good for a few laughs, but basically too much like part 1, which was much funnier and better because it was a new concept.
0345529057|5.0|First became aware of this author from watching the HBO series, 'A Game of Thrones.'  As well done as the screen version is, there is a much richer experience to be had from reading the books from the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series.  With so many characters and locales to keep track of, it's nice to have a &#34;hard copy&#34; to refer to for maps and family trees, etc.  This series is like a grown-up version of 'The Hobbit' and the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy by J.R.R.Tolkien.  Wonderfully complex, and timelessly human.
0425263924|3.0|In my opinion the first two books where amazing, having some of my best scenes ever, -I have read hundreds of romance books so I know what I am talking about ;)  So, I was excitedly waiting for book 3, expecting the story to move forward, but I instead found each of the characters stock in the same situations. I also felt that the chemistry Eva felt towards Brett where disrespectful to Gideon's character, also even though I love reading hot erotica scenes I feel that Mrs. Day use them too often and is even too graphic, we all know by now that Gideon is a sex god, what Eva's work day entitles, what they eat, her gym time, blah, blah, blah...  What I expected in this book was...<br /><br />****Spoilers****<br /><br /> Gideon talking about how he felt on seen Eva being abused in the videos, and his office fight with Nathan, I  wanted to see  Gideon's mother digging for info on his abuse,  and Gideon's brother showing a motive for his hostility. But most of all, what I wanted in this book was Gideon behaving mad, possesive, and all alpha male like before.
0544002318|5.0|This is a fantastic book with so much valuable information, including running technique, excellent recipes and a fascinating awe inspiring story about a great runner.<br /><br />I admired him as a runner but after reading this book I also admire him as a person. There is so much more he could have talked about.  His divorce, the type of person his ex-wife is, the man who was supposed to be his friend...but he didn't.  This says a lot for the character of this very funny and really interesting man.
030758836X|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this purchase. I read this book in 3 days. One night I couldn't sleep, I found myself up at 2am reading this book until I had to get ready for work. I was actually sad when it ended (which is a scary thought when you think of the book being about a couple of nut jobs).Gone Girl is brilliantly clever and wildly entertaining.
1452101248|5.0|Bought two of these, one for my daughter, one for myself.  Cannot wait to try some of these delights which we had already seen demonstrated on TV series.  Daughter was more than pleased with her double gift, coupled with Vegan Cooking for Carnivores.<br /><br />Thank you for prompt shipment which was appreciated.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great.  It works as described and has helped me maintain my battery life does not drain my battery like most of the others.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't know how anyone who loved the first two books in this series couldn't love this one! Sylvia Day, if you want to write 10 more Crossfire books, I'll devour each and every one of them and GLADLY pay $9.99 a piece for them! Can't wait for book 4!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is the funnest shooter I've played on any platform. It's juts fun to play. It's deep if you want, or just a fun game to kill some time.<br />But it gets everything right. It looks fantastic, and runs great on my Nexus 7. The control  is spot on. I've played a lot of this type of shooter over my 40 years of gaming, and this one is the best by far. Why? Because it never gets frustrating. As soon as I stared playing I knew this was something very special.<br />Thanks for making me a very happy gamer.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Pretty good movie, shows the more dark side of the Batman. Took it to a level where the dark knight needs to be.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|True to the book and attention to details as in all of the LOTR movies. I watch these over and over again. Can't wait for he extended edition to be released!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I was so excited to get this dvd for my granddaughter, it is one of the classics that I was missing.  It came in good condition and was delivered very quickly.  My granddaughter watches this 3-4 times a day when she is over
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was such a let down. It was time to wrap it up with Eva and Gideon and Mrs. Day just keeps dragging it out.  I will not be purchasing anymore of her books. The first 2 were terrific but not this one.  She must be all about the money. Completely disappointed!!!!
0425263924|5.0|I felt it was a huge surprise to find out there will be two more books. I am always sad to have the book end. Now I get to live out my Gideon fantasy a little longer.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I had to reload and start over.but see this new game a little different will write another one after I play this new one more
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game. Play it at least once a week if not more. Addictive with great graphics and multiple ways to pay
193700788X|5.0|Just finished this today, and if you have enjoyed the last few Sookie books, you will enjoy this one as well. The reviews on here really had me worried, and I'm glad to find them, for the most part, totally unfounded. It seems everyone who REALLY loved Eric with Sookie (but is completely blind to what makes Eric Eric, including his past actions over the entire series) decided they hated this book, because it did not end how they wanted it to. I thought Eric acted exactly as he had been depicted previously. I love Eric, and his arrogance, and all his negative qualities that makes him who he is. All along Sookie has told us again and again what Eric's faults were, that he was manipulative and extremely political. It's why in Book 4, when he's wiped clean of all that, she first finds himself falling for him. Given his characterization throughout the series, his actions in this volume seem spot on, though he's not in it as much as other characters.<br /><br />The only times I found it wasn't written in a similar voice, is the few expositions that are written in third person. All of the text that is from Sookie's point of view, has the identical feel of the previous books. I think the third person exposition exists as a way to avoid the part, in previous books, where all in one chapter the villain would suddenly come up, and have pages and pages of explaining of their evil plot. I'm not sure the attempt succeeded, but the Sookie narrated chapters stay very true, and they didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the book. The book starts off with a few of them, but I promise, once Sookie takes over, it's back to normal.  We get Sookie narrating southern living, and her spunk, and suddenly, horrible things happen, but she keeps going. Someone said Sookie never swore before-- in her thoughts, she has always allowed an occasional god dammit, or \\"tired as hell\\". She is a strong woman, and not a saint, and has made that clear to the reader throughout her series. Her scenes with Eric in this book made me really respect her for sticking up for herself, where in previous books, I would somehow get annoyed at how stubborn she was, here that wasn't the case.<br /><br />While not as good as the middle books-- which to me, are the best in the series-- it was my favorite read of the past few volumes. I read it in less than a week, since I only read it during my daily commute, but I could have easily blown through it in a day if I had had the time to do so. If you have enjoyed the entire series thus far, you will enjoy this edition as well. Diantha has become my favorite, with Pam and newly introduced Karin, close on her heels.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It made me want to learn more about the inventors. I will tell my husband to get this too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched Downton Abbey Season 1 on Netflix one weekend. They did not have Season 2, so I went right over to Amazon Instant to purchase it. It is a great show!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After all the hype and wait, this book lead NOWHERE! I could deal with the ending if Ms. Day developed some type real anticipation.  No what if, no imagining what's next, NOTHING!  Another thing that irked me was that she pull a few one liners from 50 shades.  Ms. Day you're a veteran in the field and most creative I must say but mirroring ELJames, tacky.  I like the fact that she's trying to develop other characters in the story just makes it the more richer BUT nothing really made sense.  I agree with another reviewer that this could have been a novella instead and I still would have bought it. Drawing out for the $, possibly.  Next time I'm waiting until all the books are out to read them and buy them at a fraction of the price.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|This is a fun romp of a read.  The characters are fun, but a little predictable.  The plot held my attention and did not work my brain too hard.  Its what I call a \\"Calgon\\" book.  It takes you away.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Cleverish use of a inky yarn to knit a crappy afghan that grandmother would have been ashamed of for its loose ends and embarrassing cast offs, and that friends would regift through various loosely connected incarnations of baby blanket, doily, and dishrag for centuries to come, hoping that one day it would unravel completely into something more purposeful. It was both kind and criminal to make such a confused piece. Hopefully this rehashing of well-loved Wachowski themes will be appreciated more in its next life (Matrix>VforVendetta>CloudAtlas>Etc...). In the meantime, consider trying harder and doing better--or die trying--because nothing else mattersssssss, never care for what they knowoohohooooh, cuz I knoooooowohhhh. Wait, wth? What is this related to? Oh, yeah, music.<br /><br />The long and the short of it: the best actor was that kid in Halle Berry's apartment (forgive me for not connecting to the characters enough to learn their names). Tom hank's accent flubbing was enough to make me cry.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved the Southern Vampire Series for the Sassy characters and fun plot twists. Sadly, you will not find either in this book.
B0028K31CE|5.0|He is one of the most gifted singers/songwriters of all time! He is dedicated to his craft and it shows.  His music is incredible!
B00C061I3K|1.0|This album doesn't suck, but it's not great either.<br /><br />It's rehashed 70s Chic disco. With a few solid electronic bits (e.g. Motherboard is great, Contact is okay) that last about 30 seconds before they go \\"meh\\" again. Not new in any way shape or form.<br /><br />One great way to tell that there is a issue with this album is that all negative reviews are met with \\"God you're stupid\\", \\"you don't get it\\", \\"%&&* You're so dumb, this album is awesome, I hate you\\" responses.<br /><br />I've never seen so many people get mad at people who don't like this album.<br /><br />Anways back to the album. It's slow, theres people talking all over it, and the one song that sounds fresh  (Get Lucky) is dominated with CHIC's disco sound....so that one sounds good of course.<br /><br />I'm glad I listended to it on spotify for free and didn't buy it.<br /><br />Alternatives:<br /><br />Old Disco:<br />Anything by Chic.<br /><br />New Disco:<br />Dmitri from Paris<br /><br />Downtempo french electronic:<br />Air: \\"Moon Safari\\" (1000x better than RAM)<br />Air: \\"10,000 Mhz Legend\\"
B007HO392S|2.0|Carrie has a great voice, but this cd does not do it justuce.She was straining and yelling to reach the notes.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I get to the end of this book and I just want to start it over again. My only complaint is that he does not have other content for me to read yet. If you read through this book and agree that it is awesome, then go buy a copy of Vernor Vinge's &#34;Rainbows End&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to play, my five year old likes it. The graphics are nice and realistic. Great for a free app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turning book that I couldn't put down.  She made me love the characters and want more!! A must read!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a pretty fun game it was one of the free paid apps. It keeps me amused for a while I recommend that you try it and it's definitely worth one buck.
B00003CXPD|5.0|If you are feeling low on a rainy day pop this disc into your DVD player and sit back and cry and smile.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|You should buy it is better than any of the other games. The towers are practically made for destroying blooms.<br /><br />.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This movie made you wonder what our country was doing playing with the A bomb toys. Thank goodness the Russians weren't as crazy as we thought they were. Nothing is left to the imagination. A TV movie production that should be seen by every person on earth.
B0031FNYGS|3.0|I specifically chose Schleich over Safari and Papo brands, because in the description it said &#34;Origin: Germany&#34;. When I got the item, which is very pretty by the way, I immediately turned it over, and it says &#34;Made in China&#34;. I feel a bit deceived, because I am trying to avoid Chinese made toys for my kids.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I enjoyed the characters immensely - Team Kaleb, y'all!  The heroine was so smart, gutsy without being a hardass. She knew her man and she knew what she could do and did it. Enjoyable to see Vaughn (hawt) Lucas (HAWT) and Judd (yum) etc.  Clear storyline with vivid details. My only complaint is the different terrorist strikes bring to mind to many current events in our world. I read to avoid those sharp edges and it brought me out of the story a bit.  Also any plot with horrible child abuse is a painful read, even with the happy resolution.
B007V65R54|3.0|Nate silver is a very smart and accomplished guy, but at times the book is a compilation of how great he is - I guess it is part biography and part analysis, some parts I have enjoyed a lot and some I found boring.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Oh wow! A FAOTD that isn't full of questionable permissions and tracking/adware. On top of that it's fun to play. Glad I installed it.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I'm a Mac Addict. I've owned pretty much every device ever invented and although I love their form/function/ease of use, the one thing that's irritated me is the cadre of ever-changing power cords. I currently use a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air. Dragging two power cords everywhere with me was annoying. This little adaptor has been a game-changer and it's a fraction of the cost of a second power cord. I recommend it to everyone who is struggling with two devices and two cords.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The twists and turns in this show leave me breathless and wanting more! Such an awesome show.. Beautifully shot with saturated colors the visual is as much a delight as the mind blowing script!!! This show rocks and I think is the best tv has come up with in decades! Please dexter don't end! Season 9 if you please!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! I could watch it again and again, highly recommend it.
015206057X|5.0|My son received this for Christmas this past year. He is 2. He LOVES this book. He brings it to me all the time to read to him. The counting is wonderful and since reading this book I have actually watched him counting things. Great book! Great price. I would buy it again!
0316056898|5.0|love love love this book.  Laughed so hard I have to read it a second time to make sure I did not miss anything.  Everyone I know wants to borrow it, I had to make a list.  Could not read in public because I was laughing so much and getting stared at.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Classic Austen!  Persuasion was a fun read which I thoroughly enjoyed in spite of its predictability.  I recommend it enthusiastically.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Great price and we use it all the time! Fit great on our stoller and I'm glad we didn't spend the money on the one that Baby Jogger sells.
B0002YLC24|5.0|With the new Linklater, Before Midnight, just out now nine years after Before Sunset it is a 'must see' even if you saw it the first time around - if you didn't it is required viewing - if you did you need to see it again to remind yourself how good these two are together!
B005974C94|5.0|What a great DVD. Eric and Marsalis are great together. The music these two generated is great to listen too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yeah this app is cool. I love subway surfers. It is much better than temple run. my friend showed me this game and I have been hooked on it ever since.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Summer 1977, graduated from High School and saw the original Star Wars at least 10 times.  I loved all of the alien creatures, especially Chewie.  As the stories progressed, a little guy named Yoda came along to teach life lessons to us all.  The Blu-ray set brought back all the memories that I remembered and the ones that I had forgotten, as well.  The trilogy is truly a collector or admirers' dream come true.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was so disappointed when I reached the last page to discover that it was not the end of the story.  How long do we have to wait now to read what happens???
B004NDVJA0|5.0|Once I put this in my cd player, I didn't take it out for about 2 weeks straight.  This album is emotion and meditation set to melody. When I listen to this, it's as though my mind lets go of all stresses in my life and I'm able to relax. Very glad I made this purchase and will be looking for more work by Agnes.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Loved how this book was spoken from the dogs point of view.  A great read.  Looking forward to more books by Garth Stein.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Its great love it my experience have been great I recommend it to all. Up until today all I have purchase have been really nice!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is an AWESOME game if I could I would give it a rating of 100 stars I love how they changed it. You can change the characters outfit. That is why I think Subway Surfers is an AWESOME game!
B001KO8AQ6|4.0|There is nothing more wonderful than after a hard days work listening to this album. It is very relaxing. And as always with Dido, you get a feeling of what she has done in her life. It is an album full of stories.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. Please take the time to read it. It grips your soul from the very start and doesn't let go.  The writer makes you feel as if you are right there in &#34;The Kitchen House&#34;.  It was well worth 3 sleepless nights of reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is it me or are we always late on updates we've been waiting for this update forever and now your making us wait even more other than that it is a good game I love first app I bought when I got my kindle
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Good thing I am not a professional movie critic or this movie would have gone nowhere. Wasted 3.99 to download, just did not think it was that good of a movie.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have read all the books (Martin is a good storyteller).  One thing is the TV series does not completely mirror the books; they take a few liberties here and there (some stuff I think they just make up to fill some parts).  However, the acting is usually very good, and I love the drawf character.  Once in a while they throw in a nude scene, but fortunately it is usually somewhat connected to the story or to showing how a character is through his actions.  There's lot of intrigue, and occasionally a battle or something violent, but most of the story is in various double crosses, back stabbings, and other such court behavior.  Since I have read all the books, nothing surprises me except the way they sometimes handle the various scenes depicting what happens (again through their own vision).  If you saw the first season and liked it, you will like this one too (I did).
B008JJM88Q|2.0|This app would've been much better, but each question takes 10 to 20 seconds to load and I frequently get errors telling me to try again. Not to mention the questions it asks are unethical. I answer that it's a boy, then 5 questions down it asks if it's a girl. Plus the names are messed up, like Catkiss Everclean from the Hunger Pain.
B002VCR03A|5.0|This book is really cool. It is honestly really good , I recommend it to any bookworm. I loved it ! Wondering if there is gonna be a sequel? Can always hope . . .
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This is a very solid CD.  William Duvall when he screams in \\"Stone\\" - I'm not your tour guide - sounds fantastic!!  If you like Alice In Chains I find it very hard to believe after repeated listens that you will not LOVE this CD.  Keep giving it a chance.  It's phenomenal.  Great songs, extremely strong instrumental performances, great vocals from everyone.  Solid production.  There really is no flaw on this CD.  My favorite CD of Alice In Chains is \\"Jar Of Flies\\" but this might come in second.  It is a very slick CD.  I love \\"Jar Of Flies\\" and \\"Dirt\\" which are my two favorite but this one may become my 2nd, it's SO SO SOLID.  They have a unit now of extremely polished and master musicians and their style has been so perfected but still sounds fresh, current.  There is nothing lacking on this album.  With time I think this CD will resonate for the next few decades.  It's excellent.  No questions.  Just keep listening.  Love \\"Stone\\" especially, \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Voices\\" are great - every single song connects with me, they are all great.  The reason some may say different is because this is a very HARD record, \\"Jar Of Flies\\" was more acoustic in ways, this one ROCKS.  There is some acoustic - but much harder than I expected and am pleased being almost 50, it's good to rock out and ALICE IN CHAINS has.  Truly fantastic, keep listening, you'll see yourself!!  Great record, think it should do very well.  Radio jump on this one.  This will be a classic in time.
055380684X|5.0|This book was well written and one of a kind! I am a serious flutist and the ideas presented about practice were unique and applicable! I highly recommend this!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Ugh, emotionally devoid of any interest on my part. And I can not imagine caring about the fourth book! This should have  been tied up.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is extremely fun to play and the music makes you feel like you are in the setting! if you get this game I hope that you feel the same way as me
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was well written and thought out. It will keep you thinking, and the underlying message is phenomenal.  I definitely recommend it
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I saw it at the local theater and decided that I have to added to my personal collection. Very touching film.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, this is a bit weird. I read this book because I have so many women friends who said they had read it.<br />I am a male, and I didn't really expect to like it.<br />But somehow, it always managed to keep my attention, and made me want to read more.<br /><br />In some ways, it reminds me of the erotic books I read during my college years.<br /><br />The details in the book are quite amazing.  Either the author did incredible research, or has actually experienced S&M.<br /><br />I guess in some ways, it really is just an unusual, erotic love story.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I've just started to read the Honor Harrington series of books.  This was as good to read as the fist one On Basilik Station.  I enjoyed it.  The characters are interesting and the plot moves along.  Added to that you get a lot of background story are well - lots of threads being drawn together.  Now onto the next one!
0425263924|2.0|I am sick to death of authors taking financial advantage of their fans.  The ending wasn't even at a logical breaking point and the plot has lost all intent.  Sylvia Day should be embarrassed and ashamed.<br /><br />Just search kindle refunds in the bar above and tell the editor and Ms. Day that enough is enough by returning your version.  I've already returned mine.
B00628RFPM|5.0|I purchased this movie so my middle school students could watch it. The movie was thought provoking. It was both heart wrenching and heart warming. The innocence of the boys was what you wanted them to hold on to, but knew that reality would be encroaching on them soon enough. The movie brings home the injustice and travesties of that era through irony. It was an extremely well done movie that moved me as an adult and brought home salient points to my students without exposing them to the horrific situations the Jewish people had to suffer through. I highly recommend this movie.
B000NQRE1E|3.0|Just a word of warning for those who do not have Blu-Ray players:  This appears to be a joint DVD/Blu-Ray release; however, the only DVD item in the set is the film itself which runs to two discs.  The special features, including the deleted scenes, are on the two Blu-Ray discs.  The deleted scenes and, I believe, a number of the other special features, are available on the DVD \\"Special Collector's Edition,\\" which is over $10 more expensive than this edition.  Maybe it's just assumed these days that everything on these joint releases is on Blu-Ray, except for the movie itself.  That's certainliy okay, if such is the case, and it would be better if the home page on amazon for the release specified as much.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this is an amazing app. i have a motorola razor HD and had no problems with it. the fun thing to do is call a friend from a landline (home/office) and a bit into the conversation ask if you can play a quick game with them. Put your cell phone on silent and start playing the game. they think you are doing the guessing. it freaks them out how good you are. sometimes i tell them its an app, sometimes I don't.<br /><br />for the adult users,  it does porn stars. after the 5th question it asked if it was a porn star. then it asked if the character was fat. I answered yes.the next thing the start image pops up and it's a picture of ron jeremy!!!!!<br /><br />i got it free, but i would have paid $1.99!!! very fun!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I played other hidden object games this one is one of the best. I'm looking forward when the sequel comes out I can't wait
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I've been a fan of Cinderella since 1987 and couldn't wait to give this disc a spin. Every song on this album is well written and very catchy. From opening track Solid Ground to closer Babylon, this disk takes you into the depths of the Mississippi to the streets of New Orleans, Tom Keifer does not disappoint. I ordered mine and since getting it a couple of weeks ago, I cannot stop listening to it. Do yourself a favour and treat yourself.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game that has you waiting to play again. The only bad part is that goals build up fast and you can't complete them fast.
0374275637|3.0|The author offers some rather mind-boggling observations, and you get hooked.<br /><br />THEN you start noticing that he makes huge, sweeping statements of fact with absolutely no objective support.  He just blows a bunch of smoke and moves on, leaving the reader blinking in his editorial wake.  What he says is interesting and thought-provoking.  I just wish he'd offered more rational support for his statements than \\"Because I said it in print.\\"  That doesn't cut much argumentative mustard for other scholars or critical laypeople.<br /><br />Some parts are flat-out silly in their pretension.  He's got a good mind and he's trained it well.....but a touch of humility would make him a more credible scholar.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I played this once and found it cute but wasn't too impressed. Then I found I keep going back to play it multiple times a day. Eating people is fun. I'm sure i'll tire of it in a few weeks, but its a lot of addicting fun for a free download.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|Zero Dark Thirty has the perfect title! It describes the rating it deserves ZERO! The Dark must be referring to all the \\"black\\" scene periods in the movie, and the thirty part of about all the action of this 2 hour and 34 minutes long movie offers. 5 Academy Awards?  What a joke! It is also a bit inaccurate to say the least. The Seal Team took off from an aircraft carrier and returned to the carrier with OBL's body! To use of the one of the more intelligent words Maya used in describing  herself from this film is to say it is a MF-ing waste of time to watch it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great way to continue the series! Really satisfying! Many cool unexpected events. Can't wait to see the movie that is near (:
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter loves the show and absolutely loved the game.  It's happy and charming and while there is a paid store inside, it's entirely possible to be patient and just play day to day to progress in the game so far as I could tell.<br /><br />The first downfall came after about 2 weeks of playing - the game chose to reset all its history and start us back at the beginning.  My daughter was understandably a little upset at having to do everything over but we figured \\"hey, it's free, and it doesn't hurt\\".  Then it happened again... but this time after a much longer period playing, earning, and slowly unlocking more and more of the ponies and characters she loved.<br /><br />I would highly recommend against this game simply because there's apparently no guarantee of saving state. I can't imagine how annoyed I would be had we actually spent money to acquire in game items too.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's cool and all but it don't have the 7.0 yet. I love kindle but if this how some of the apps act like this. Imma get a new tablet. But the game is still cool.
B006HL9G10|5.0|this app works exactly as stated.  I use it on a kindle fire with no problems.  I love addition of the website with groups.  I can not recommend highly enough.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's pretty rare to come across new ideas for story content, but this one is great!  I love the world that this author has built.  The heavy underground darkness of the silo setting weighing down on everyone truly adds to the sense of creeping paranoia that builds throughout the story.  The silo is as much one of the characters in the story as Juliette or Bernard.  I would love to see this play out as a miniseries.  The sets, the costumes, the epic battles, the loves stories, and of course, the political oeuvres.  I'm definitely looking forward to more from this author.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|included film, extras and a booklet that came with original storyboards. this movie is part of the canon, a must-have
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is a beautiful and wonderful CD Love it!<br />Carol King just won the 2013 Gershwin Prize of the Library of Congress Music Award. This CD is awesome, a regal living remembrance of her.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My friends were asking why I didn't update my game I said I didn't know that there was a update so I went to update it but it would not update. I am mad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved minecraft on the computer and x-box and now its on the go sooooo much fun they need two update more though
B003PBB4ME|5.0|this thing is awesome. its extremely helpful in making movies with my dslr cannon rebel t3i. thanks to whoever designed it
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is fun but is quite repatative. the items floating all over the screen are a bit distracting at times.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited months for the last book of a trilogy,  only to find out that there will now by 4 or 5 books.  Very disappointed in not only that,  but that the ending just really went no where.  Its like she stopped in the middle of a sentence.  I raved about this series to so many people and recommended it so highly.  I can't believe that she stopped it where she did and there was no forewarning at all.  I guess the $$$ signs and potential earnings meant more to her than the actually storyline.  I will never recommend a Sylvia Day book again.  If you haven't already ordered it for the 10.00,  i would recommend you find someone to borrow it off of if you feel you really must read it.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I have been looking for a portable card game like this forever so awesome. Easy to learn but still fun with lots of challenges
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to who I really am. I always was called shy and felt bad about it. I don't like to socialize or do team building so I seem distant to others. If you are uncomfortable in social settings, would rather stay home than go to a party, prefer to have an office with a door, this book is a must read. I no longer feel like an outsider in this world and I'm not shy. My son is an introvert also and I wish I would have read this when he was younger. He shouldn't feel bad for only having a few close friends and not wanting to go out with groups. We are introverts and proud of it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I made with way through season 1 and 2 in one weekend. This shows definitely trumps Elementary (the american version of Sherlock in modern times) as it stays more true to SACD's storylines and character traits of Holmes and Watson.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited for 7 months for this book only to be disappointed after reading it. The story is going nowhere that obviously Ms day is stretching the story unnecessarily. The third book did not accomplish anything. It is so stagnant. There is no plot.  After the long wait, Ms Day owes the reader to the give a nice climax and closure to the story. Instead, she stretched the story in order to make 5 books of what is supposed to be a TRILOGY.  I felt cheated, disrespected and betrayed. Ms Day and the publisher are obviously trying to make money. Ms Day, you underestimated the intelligence of the readers.  The success of a book rest on the hands of the readers. But if the readers felt disrespected, then they will not be interested to buy your 4th or 5th series. I am done with Crossfire series. Fifty shades author has so much respect for readers that she ended the trilogy with the readers feeling satisfied and happy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I always play this game. It is a good replica of the events of the movie. I recommend this game
B003G4W49C|4.0|Forgot how much I liked this book the first time I read it. Just as good the second time around.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story was so heartbreaking and still so wonderful. It's horrible that those institutions ever existed to abuse so many children.
0385349947|5.0|I bought this book in hard cover and then went back and bought in audio so I could share it with others who work with me. Love it!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|bought this along with several other movies and enjoyed them all.  will purchase additional items in future. what more can I say.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|was so surprised that this was really a very good movie. Arnold has gotten older but this movie played on the fact that he has gotten older and it was good.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|good movie and fair price. bought several others at same time and enjoyed them also.  what more can I say
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|i did not purchase the book. i watched the video and use Dr. Mosely website as well as other fast five forums ( myfitnesspal ) and the 5:2 in the UK.... to learn the do's and dont's. i have been on the diet a couple of weeks and have lost inches already. There is also tips on his web site \\" if \\" your one of the odd ones that is not losing weight following the plan. I am loosing - i like being able to eat healthy normal on feast days. i enjoy the new energy. it is worth the try if you can make the effort. i am walking daily with a 10lb weight vest and do weight lifting (mostly- push and pull 20 mins ) 1 or 2 days a week. female/ 50 yoa.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|saw this at the theater when it first came out and must admit with our new 3D tv the movie was just a good.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this is a cool little game. not to hard but enough to make you think. graphics are great and very smooth.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I like the about the filming of psycho.  I sure wouldn't take a shower when alone.  All good actors.  I highly recommend.
B00005N6RU|5.0|This is another scarey movie, but with a Hitchcock twist which he does so well.  The beautiful, cool-blonde, and sophisticated Tippi' Hendren plays in it .  It seems like she brought all the birds with her when she arrived at the village.  A must see for those who love Hitchcock.  Susan
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I read this thinking it couldn't be as bad as the reviews I saw and it wasn't. But it definitely wasn't worth the wait in my opinion. I hope she finished strong with this next book and that it's the last because this was just whatever. I didn't have any of the same emotional connection to this book like I did the first 2. Seems like it was just an expensive way to add more supposed episodes to the mini series based on this series.
B00000K19E|5.0|I love this movie!  The symbolism is terrific for those who are awake and not just looking at it as a Psy-Fy Action film.  Every time I need a refresher about what all is going on in the Matrix that we do live in I put the CD in my player and watch it.  It keeps you real.  Susan
B009G78EE2|5.0|Finally a great hip hop album again! So many great songs, great message and awesome beat. I would highly recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Was having an issue with connecting my charger.  Couldn't get it to charge without wiggling the cord and to get the orange light to come on and then would have to prop something underneath it to keep it tight. This new charger was supposed to be bigger and solve the problem.  IT DID NOT! Still have to fight with it everytime I need to charge it, which is frequently. Very disappointed.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|This was a delight to read. Like all the books in the series, it dragged a bit, but knowing that there would be an ending made it worthwhile. The plot development and delivery did not disappoint. After following this for years, I am so glad that Sanderson was brought in to complete the work.  Well done.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|The best for unwinding on the way home from a stressful day at work. Your family will benefit from this as well.
B00AYQNOU8|2.0|I saw Samsara and I thought I would like it at first, but it transformed into this wordless PC guilt trip deal. When the geisha actually shed a tear, I was done. And then there was the performance artist. This movie was trying so hard to be deep. Nice photography, and for that I would watch half of it over again. But seriously, when you get to \\"the Americans\\" being overweight in a fast food restaurant, or, in another tableau, staring into the camera clutching their gunbelts, you can't help but think that the stuff from the rest of the world is also just a collection of cliches. I would have loved to have traveled through all those different countries making it, though. So I'm both jelly that they got to do it, and eye-rolly that they didn't learn enough from the experience to impart something truly insightful to the audience. \\"Shocking to the first-world gaze\\" is not exactly the same as \\"mystically mind-opening\\", but like a lot of bad art we're supposed to be in awe of their masterful technique and that oooh, they \\"went there,\\" and ignore the fact that it's basically wank. Being extreme is not enough anymore; privileged first world types who want to peer into Reality by exploring awe and horror vicariously are, first off, annoying emo-tourists, but should also keep in mind that \\"the other\\" is not yours to condescendingly interpret in terms of yourself, or your portraits are just taxidermied likenesses, not windows into souls. You don't just go into the cauldron and watch it swirl about you, floating on top and taking notes with half your mind on how you're going to exploit it. You become it, and are changed by it. The movie should draw the viewer in that deeply. I'm that guy, I'm that girl, I'm infinite space and eternal stone, I died too and I've been in prison, I picked rags on a trash heap and lived in paradise and I see behind the masks. Because now I remember. You can't just notice that your heart should be broken, it has to BE BROKEN and heal again and then you have some art. The road out of the broken heart is the poet's gift to the rest of us poor suckers. But does Samsara generate true compassion, union of the viewer with its subjects, or do we just feel pity? And guilt? Guilt is bulls***; success is when we feel love.u have some art. The road out of the broken heart is the poet's gift to the rest of us poor suckers.

B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|I looked all over for a flight simulator app that my son could easily use, and this is it. He loves shooting down the other helicopter. It's challenging enough for him, but not so difficult that he never wins. I start him out working on sight words or math apps, and inevitably find him shooting down helicopters. This is by far his favorite app.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Haven't finished it yet, but good game. Nice that it was free also. Angry birds is a great way to pass the time.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|Showcases a time when Kiss ruled. A must have for true diehard fans.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|As I've come to expect from this dev, this game is very well thought out and fun to play each and every stage. The graphics are nice, and the HD is definitely appreciated. Keep up the great work!
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|This lantern is great - we went camping with it, and it still worked after being rained on for 3 days! We like the little blinking green light that tells you where it is, too. Our only complaint is that we wish it was just a little brighter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was stolen while we were camping, and then the usually more pricey Rayovac Sportsman lantern was cheaper for a while, so I replaced it with that. If anyone wants, I'll write a comparison once it gets here!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Full of talented musicians.  A warm story of forever love.<br />Freddie Highmore is wonderful  while Robin Williams is a fun character that you will love and hate at the same time.
B0038P59A0|4.0|This movie was a little dark and sinister, but a good mystery movie with action and suspense.  I enjoyed it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This item is exactly as described and is greatl. Have watched it fora couple of iimes already am having movie nght again KLM MN
B000002JNJ|5.0|We just LOVE Pantera and have since we were, well..........before most people....for over 15 years anyway. If you like Pantera, you have to own them all....Cowboys was just the beginning! BUY IT!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This item is exactly as described and is greatl. Have watched it fora couple of iimes already am having movie nght again KLM MN
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh is amazing! I have seen Hamlet performed many, many times as well as seen all of the DVD/VCR movie productions ever made. This ABOVE ALL is the best production and performance that I have ever seen. Definitly worth owning!
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|bout her life.  In the end, however,one learns that Davis had befriended,or, at least, let him visit her and her third husband, William Grant Sherry at their Laguna Beach, CA home.  It gives an early idea of how much Davis was admired in Great Britain.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|An awesome free product.  visually appealing and very functional. Just as good as our ipad app. We are happy with it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app has literally EVERYTHING.  it's not one of those games that all u get to do is just do their make up. u get to do their outfits too. u just don't get everything on there. (meaning the people,some makeup dresses, and some other accessories.)
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I think it would be better with like a free part where you get to play what ever but other then that i like it
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I have to say this book would probably make a very interesting movie but the book is driving me crazy. It drags on forever. It jumps around too much from this year and back to that year, like I'm going to remember all these dates and what happened when? There's a ton of characters and not enough information given about each to clearly remember who some of them are or maybe it's that too many chapters pass before they're reintroduced again. Plus it's tricky on a Kindle to skip back several chapters to refresh your memory. Currently, the story is at 80% on my Kindle and (maybe)it's starting to get just slightly captivating. I'm hanging in there because it was highly recommended by a friend but I do not think I will read another one of her recommendations. Ugh, this book has left me frustrated!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I am really enjoying this game.  I like trying to figure out how to get all 3 stars for each level.
B000FJXQUC|1.0|movie sold as new, came in as a double DVD, after watch the movie you could see it was a bad copy made for a video.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|not only is it awesome but it works great on my kindle fire. I love the way my kid says wow.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My 30 month son loves this movie, this is the one that started all, a good five star rating to the theme and story I would definitely recommend this movie  which is not scary at all it has a nice plot.
0425263924|1.0|I, too, was left hanging like other reviews. I waited forever, preordered the book, and at the end I was like WTF. So annoying. It does seem like they are trying to make a dime. fail. I wont be reading book 4&5. And there was way too much sex in this book
037582913X|5.0|This hardcover children's book is a great keepsake for adults and a durable book for kids. The cover is perfectly glossy, and even the paper is high quality and durable. I remember this book from my childhood, so I'm glad I could still get it today for my family.
0345803485|1.0|Story line was interesting but the grammar was poor author also used holy s##t about every other paragraph got old after awhile.  Would not recommend.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|this is very well made.  the acting is superb and the message is splendid.  it is very romantic with the best movie kiss ever.
B005CM1IMU|5.0|Introducing my kids to this classic flick, that launched Susan Sarandon and Tim Curry into mainstream is a must see. Plus Meatloaf is hilarious.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Trilogy? I was taught that meant 3, am I not correct?  I feel he story has been dragged out and that it lost it's way during this 3rd book, it was like the author is attempting to stretch out the story for another book and I feel she has sold us all out and is focusing on the dollars rather than quality.  I can honestly say I will not purchase any further books in this 'trilogy' as it is very watery now.<br />I am very disappointed and would love to ask for a refund as it certainly did not deliver the high expectations it was advertising.  In addition the launch date continued to be pushed back.<br />A longer third book would have been a fabulous way to finish this book.<br />Listen to your audience please!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting this book to see where Gideon and Eva's story took them. Ms. Day did not disappoint. Their story is a crazy whirlwind romance that gets better with every book. I cannot wait for the next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's very realistic. I grew up around horses so this helps to keep me from getting homesick. I just wish it was a little easier to get diamonds.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG....I can't wait for the 4th book....this was my fave so far. I can't wait to see what Sylvia Day has in-store for us next.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love playing this game, the only thing that I would change is once you pass all levels be able to go to the next one instead of waiting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have a couple of other Bible apps on my phone, but this is the one I turn to most frequently. It even has Greek and Chinese traditional versions. And i can't wait to view the videos while traveling. Kudos to the developers!
0425263924|2.0|*FREE OF SPOILERS** The main problem with the third installment of The Crossfire Series is it didn't go anywhere.  Without giving away too much, this book would have fared better if it HAD left us with a cliffhanger: (perhaps an arrest of Gideon for Nathan's murder, have something happen to Eva to show a softer, scared, vulnerable side to Gideon & actually explore how lost he truly is without her).<br /><br />This did not feel like a new book, just some extra chapters added onto the second installment. There was no meat to sink your teeth into with regard to character development.<br /><br />I did enjoy two of the \\"racy\\" scenes (particularly in the private plane), but nothing had me anxious to turn the page in suspense for what was next.  In the end (which apparently this isn't), it didn't really leave me wanting more.<br /><br />People who are giving THIS book 5 stars do not read enough books.
B007SGM084|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because what can I say it's awesome!!!I enjoyed every minute of it and I hope she would write more books. I love how she captured imperfect romance perfectly
B007O4XX9K|2.0|It sounded more lke a practice session. It did not meet mu expections. Maybe he should stick with the Eagles.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It has great graphics and I love how the destination changes like from Tokyo to miami. I enjoy playing this game
B00908DDZM|5.0|Hands down the best hip-hop album of the past 5 years. There is literally no other person in the music industry today more deserving of fame. Macklemore, you earned it bro.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great!!! I definitely enjoyed playing it!!! And the graphics were wonderful. However, it was pretty short, I wish it were longer. I can't wait until the next chapter.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great fun! The graphics are nice, the images are fun, something useful for kids to play with as they will find it fun and will also develop their thinking.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This app is so creepy..it actually guesses who I'm thinking about. It works fine for the Kindle Fire and I haven't experienced any issues with it so far.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|This was a great price for Rod's latest CD. I really like this CD, and a few of the songs I absolutely love. It is great to see Rod back to his true rock and roll style. The &#34;oldies&#34; were ok but I was getting bored. I was yearning for some new rockin' tunes in Rod's great gritty voice. I found them here. The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is that i feel Rod has more and maybe ever better music in him.  Another rock CD or the country CD I have heard rumors about have me looking forward. This CD is definitely worth the price. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive and fun it can halt all boredom it requires focus I really like playing this game and getting high scores and prizes
0694003611|5.0|My son is going to love this book! Thick pages in the book to last a long time. Love it!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|James Dashner<br />this is my favorite book in your whole series. I listened to all my songs while I read your books. Your books made me cry!!!<br />Thank you for making this series sooooo much!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My old charger for my original amazon kindle got busted, I contacted amazon customer service live chat, they give me free credit and got this baby for free! woot!
B00A7W29BE|2.0|Got this Free app on May 31,2013 and still can't locate where it downloaded to. I'm sure its worthy of 5 stars, but I may never know unless I purchase and download it again.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Ok I am going to try to keep this review as short as possible but I think I might have to sleep in the doghouse tonight since my wife came home and found me having disturbing yet amazingly strange sex with my new QoTsA album. My wife was shocked at first but then decided to cry since I haven't touched her the day I pre-ordered this album 3 months before release. I tried to explain to her why I was having strange sex with the Like Clockwork album but she couldn't understand and for that I am sleeping in the doghouse tonight (well my couch to be honest) but that turned out to be a mistake when she got up at 1am to get something to drink. After the wife got her glass of water, she caught me having sex AGAIN with the QoTsA amazingly new album \\"Like Clockwork\\" and for that she forced me out of my own house and I had to check into a Motel 6. Do I regret it? Hell no! I called her the next day and told her to tell the kids that I won't be home for awhile, probably a week or two? She didn't understand what I was going through and I tried once again explaining to her how QoTsA is important but I could tell she didn't care that much. She was too focused on the whole \\"YOU NEED TO SPEND TIME WITH ME AND THE KIDS, THEY ARE IMPORTANT\\" drama. Yeah OOOOOOOOOOOOKay, like that is important because it isn't, QoTsA new album Like Clockwork was FAR more important. Anyways yeah, buy this album if you prefer QoTsA than the wife cause I know I do.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Purchased this as a Free app on May 31,2013, but can't locate where it downloaded to on my Zeki tablet. I had NO problems with Netflix app downloading and installing. I'm sure this is a good app. Until I find it, I may never know. Customer service was unable to assist me with this app and Genius Scan app.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|So much of t.v. right now is downright garbage. Mindless pap meant to deaden your cerbellum. There is so much to think about while watching this show, you can't help but love it!
B004NELBPC|1.0|Even though I read through the negative reviews for the latest update, I had hoped developers had listened and fixed the app.  This app is useless on the Fire in its present format. Too bad since I am a fan of the Huff.  I'll either read online or pass it by completely. But will NOT be using this app.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Fantastic show, worth every penny and then some. Wish I would have found it sooner, since there is truly nothing of value on t.v. right now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game I have ever played!!! The best part or the.game is when you go to Miami!
B0090SI460|2.0|Returned it twice because the 3D did not work properly, Blu-ray didn't play at all.  Even after 2 tries it didn't play.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|What a FANtastic movie.Non-stop action,funny,full of acting greats,great transfer to blu-ray,great story,great casting,in color,and great direction.You'll miss a lot if you blink.So watch it twice.....support your favorite artists.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this as a gift for graduation and it was a wonderful gift.  It was delivered very quickly and was exactly as described! It was for my daughter's boyfriend and he loved it!
B009MF56GC|5.0|Just as much fun as the 1st Expendables.Non-stop action,great casting,great acting,great story,great transfer to blu-ray,and funny.WARNING:You'll need to watch at least twice to catch it all.Great movie...support your favorite artists.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Our son took ours to school.  I needed to order a new one to keep our two kindles powered up.  We are a multi-Kindle family.
0425263924|1.0|Very disappointed. This book was so repetitive and drawn out. I wanted to smack Eva almost every other page. It really could have been 100 pages or less. A lot of sex scenes, but no advancement in the storyline and absolutely no resolution to anything. The stuff the author added could have been used in another book with different characters, it was so random and unneeded. Definitely no longer interested in how this &#34;series&#34; ends. And would definitely not recommend spending $10. It was a $2.99 story if that.
B007REV4T8|4.0|finally, after much confusion from casino royal and quantum of solice it is finally coming back to the basics of what makes Bond Bond. the cool cars, gadgets from &#34;Q&#34;, bond girl, and more. hope it continues
1780387105|5.0|Some great songs in here. They are well outlined and explained.  The ringed binding makes it easy to use.  This book is a most useful tool and a great compliment to the justinguitar course.
B002VWNID6|4.0|good classic movie to watch once or twice a year. has all the elements of a good &#34;Robin Hood&#34; film<br />also recomend Braveheart with Mel Gibson.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love th game so much I have all versions of the game I have Been playing PE for the longest amount of<br />Time I saw the new update was out I look on my kindle fire hd but no update why does the kindle not have the new update did they stop marking it for th kindle?

B0060MYM3S|5.0|got the first season two weeks ago and had to get the second season asap. has everything a midevil series should. can't wait for season 3 to be on dvd.
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|Engaging game - fun locations, the hints can sometimes be unhelpful but there are only so many options per scene anyhow that it isn't too difficult to narrow down your next move when you get stuck.  Puzzles were easy and sometimes that's nice !
B008CLI4N4|5.0|love the series! has everything a good medevil series should. including magic, gods, dragons, knights and kings.<br />also recomend Spartacus from Showtime
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was such a fun game, please don't take too long getting the next edition out!  What I loved was each puzzle took some thought and problem solving, BUT was not so stupidly hard and impossible that it caused an increase in blood pressure and ultimately a loss of interest, I can't wait for the next Room!!!  This one was pure genius and I expect the same in each future edition!!  Thank you
B0091REZMW|4.0|mystery manor seems fun. I am new to the game but have enjoyed it so far. I cant wait to see how mysterious the game gets.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie was great and I loved it so much, and ordered additional movies I am a fan of these kinds of movies and hope to order more in the future.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've purchased the entire available series after watching them on TV over the years, because last season just ended and there is nothing else comparably good or entertaining. Can't wait for the next season.<br /><br />Series start with two boys, brothers whose characters and personalities emerge as you go through the episodes with them.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Classic sounds with a modern vibe!  For those who demand the highest quality in songwriting, audio / production, musicianship, and longevity, and who enjoy music that takes you on a journey, always surprising you with each turn, this is it.<br /><br />Not a continuation of \\"Grace for Drowning\\" (another superb SW release), rather, a new chapter for this fantastic band.<br /><br />Exceptional musicians!!  Exceptional songs!!  Audiophile quality recording!! (One of the finest SOUNDING audio quality releases I have heard)<br /><br />Marco (Drums)- Creates a terrific vibe and enthusiastic energy everywhere;<br />Theo (Various Brass) - You add so much to the music! I never dug the flutes in Jethro Tull, but your contributions are outstanding;<br />Nick (Bass) - Exciting, diverse and intense (I love the regular bass AND stick work);<br />Adam (Keys) - Wonderfully blends jazz influences with a myriad of cool sounds into this high octane outing;<br />Guthrie (Guitar) - Amazing talent, can nail any style, and oh, that solo in \\"Drive Home\\" -- simply incredible!<br />Steven (Who's he???)- Creative force, excellent songwriting, powerful and moving lyrics (Raven), etc.<br /><br />Drive Home, Holy Drinker, and Raven are my faves but all songs are strong.<br /><br />My only complaint???  Its not long enough.  Seriously though, GREAT record Steven and band.  Keep up the TERRIFIC work.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Waited too long to read the conclusion of the TRILOGY only to find out it's not over... until TWO more books that will be released sometime in the future? That's a horrible way to treat fans and encourage any loyalty.

B0002KPIQY|4.0|So let's see if I have this right. When this movie was originally released, they edited out the nude scenes with Jolie because she had become famous and I guess it was decided (or she decided) that it was no longer appropriate to have her exposed in such a way. Then after she became even more famous, they re-released the movie and put all the nudity back in. Oh, sure, makes complete sense. Other than that, a great movie. Even though I had to buy it twice.

B009MO57H6|4.0|I would have given this movie five stars, but the ending which is yet another cliff-hanger non-ending, is getting to be a bit old with this series. So end it already. And if they don't produce another, which is always a possibility, then it was all a lot to do about nothing? That said, Resident Evil has always been a winner with excellent acting and amazing visuals. Jovovich was born for the role. But I've only got one more sequel left in me; let's hope the filmmakers do also.

No wonder Supernatural fans are fiercely devoted.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very good movie.  Lost my 3 year old granddaughter for the first half, but she loved the second half.  Very enjoyable.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did not enjoy this book near as much as Khaled Hosseini's first two.  It seemed a little disjointed to me. I would put it down at night before going to bed and when I would pick it up to continue the next day, I would have to backtrack to see which character he was referring to.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|great game, simple, colorful and puzzles enjoyable to solve. just what  you need to take your mind off troubles or to keep a grandchild amused.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|Bought this along with two micro SD cards to use in a PSP.  Much cheaper than the proprietary Memory Pro Duo sticks.  I've had no problems with the adapter after many months of using it.  It just sits in the card slot so I don't see how it would break.  Recommended.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Loved the music and I saw the movie so I wanted the CD to be able to watch it again.
1476733953|5.0|Some of my favorite novels include 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Brave New World so I guess you could say that I enjoy good dystopian fiction.  This book does not disappoint.  The world that is created by Mr. Howey is extremely vivid, you could just imagine what something like the silo would feel like.  Into this bleak world he deposits well thought out characters who are very &#34;human&#34; for lack of a better term.  You could see yourself coming into contact with these kinds of people out in the real world.  They are flawed, helpless, hopeful, and by the end of the story you come to grow to love (and hate) them.  If you enjoy dystopian stories even a little bit you should pick this up.  It reads very quickly and if you're like me you won't want to put it down.  Highly recommended.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I loved the music and it is great to play while driving your car and you can sing along to all the wonderful songs.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|loved this one.it was long and challenging. not all pieces in the search puzzles to mix it up a bit. good search game.
B009HEP41A|5.0|I love Karia Knightly and drove 60  miles to a theater to see this movie in Dec as it was not playing in my area.  So I knew after I saw the movie that I wanted to add it to my collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is 1 of the best game I could have downloaded. Subway surfer is a great game. Download the game and rate it yourself!;)
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|I'm very disappointed in this movie. Burton is usually amazing this was slow and not much story with it. A bit creepy and guess if you haven't watched \\"pet semetary\\" then may hold your attention. not recommended. Wont ever make the classics in my book. save your money or rent b4 buying at $20.
B003Q6D2B4|1.0|I am new to Amazon & I love it. I only shop with gift<br />cards to limit my spending, or who knows what!<br />I recently bought this movie &#34;Red&#34; and then deleted<br />my tracking receipt. I tore off the plastic wrap on the<br />movie tonight and it was empty! I don't know how<br />to find who I bought it from, or even if I can prove<br />I got no movie.  so my review is &#34;I hate it&#34;!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The concept of this film is bizaare.<br />Hardly inspired but certainly iconoclastic just for the sake of being so.<br />And then submitting two possible interpretations at the very end - what does that add?<br />It begins with an odd premise in the first place - a vegetarian family in India that runs a private zoo full of carnivorous animals who moves it to Canada on a ship - well it's a new first at least.<br /><br />It's implausible from the beginning but succeeds thereafter as an involving fantasy with appealing visuals.<br />The tacked on alternative ending serves little purpose but I guess does serve to bring it all down to reality in a certain way.<br />An oddity is this film's obsession with vegetarianism vs. meat eating.<br />From the Buddhist ship travellers assuring the Indian family that the gravy is ok for a vegetarian (even though it might have meat in it???) , to the father showing the son the violence of the tiger as it attacks a helpless young goat, to the implied gorging of the tiger on the orangutan, zebra and hyena, to the vegetarian family with carnivores to an island of more meerkats per sq. foot than ever seen before providing more flesh for the tiger.......see what I mean?<br />The whole thing is nonsensical.  Or maybe it just requires more suspension of belief than the usual movie fantasy.<br />Also I understand why he is called Pi, but what does that have to do with anything else in the story?<br />Including his ability to memorize and calculate incredible numbers of digits for the value of pi?<br /><br />Even though there never was a moment when I thought \\"Gee why didn't I think of that\\" I give it 4 stars anyway for the wtf factor alone.
B009OA57MI|5.0|Good game overall needs some more planes also the aiming for the machine gun is a little off but overall fun and I've had no problems with it also I don't see y so many people rated it so low thanks RORTOS.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book & was terribly disappointed. The best thing in this book are the sex scenes. The majority of the time I was reading, all I could think was WHY? Why would 2 intellegent people make such stupid choices. So much of this book just makes no sense in the real world. Once again I have to ask WHY? This story just feels like the author thru stuff out there for shock value. It was like watching a train wreck.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like it a whole lot it's a great why for me to release stress and most of all just simply have some fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update for I devices but not kindle fire when will it come out please respond anyone I want it to come out for kindle there is servers finally
B004PYDBVM|4.0|From the very first chapter of The Aquariums of Pyongyang, one is gripped by the horror of living in a country that is one gigantic concentration camp, where the population is brutally controlled from the cradle to the grave and if you're unfortunate enough to break one of the Dear Leader`s rules you find yourself thinking, like the old saying goes, you're better off dead than red in its most literal sense. This story should be read by anyone who values freedom and wants to know what it feels like to lose it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|No Spoilers....I understand if you thought this was the last book, that you might be disappointed with the ending. BUT, Sylvia said months ago that this wasn't the end and there would be 2 more books. And, obviously, as you neared the ending, you had to have come to the realization that this wasn't the end. I think EWY was perfect! They needed this book to work through some issues and bring some more questions to the surface. They are too riddled with problems, individually and together, for them to get their HEA so soon.  They have only known each other a few months when this story starts, and this one only covers a short time span as well.  I think their relationship needed everything that happens in this book, and I'm excited for what comes next. I suggest people read this book with an open mind that their journey is a long one, filled with some painful moments and some pretty darn hot ones too. lol  This book definitely gives you some very steamy moments. Eva and Gideon are just made for each other, and I believe that they will get their HEA.  We just need to trust Ms Day and enjoy the ride.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Nice historic flow. Would've loved to have seen more of Corey Taylor from Slipknot for a young point of view.
0765325950|5.0|I love this series and have been reading it for 20 years.  I am both sad that it has come to an end and excited to finally learn what happens to everyone.  While not my favorite book in the series, it's a wonderful book and great end to a fabulous tale.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|I actually read West World in paperback and saw the movie as a new release, at the time the movie blew me away, nothing like today with no C/G and HD but it was 70's sci-fi at it's best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so Awesome, I even recommend to other people that like temple run is the same only this tome your running from an inspector
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you loved Firefly, this is awesome.  Answers a question or two from the series and then adds more.  I am hoping for a sequel.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It ended as I knew it only could in my mind, but was a wonderful ride. I drove seven hours to have my first Kindle autographed by Mrs. Harris in Shreveport and have enjoyed all her writings. It is sad to say goodbye to Sookie but all things do come to an end.  I reread some of my faves and look forward to new offerings from this yummy creative author, who has seen me through  many a night full of insomnia.  I will always pine for Barry the bellboy!
B001EN71CW|5.0|The best series ever axed.  The followers of the series offered to pony up the cash to keep it going.  The show was just that great.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Some people have complained about the story lacking in the film or the action being too congested, but I loved it. I really like everything having to do with the era it was set in. From the detectives to the art deco plastered all over every building, it was an amazing film. Emma Stone is a bombshell. Sean Penn puts in a nostalgic role of mafia kingpin. Plus, what's not to like about Ryan Gosling? Great watch, a perfect magnifying glass to the world which once was brimming with neon signs and the struggle against corruption.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|As a few other reviewers have stated, all discs sound fantastic except &#34;The Long Run&#34;  the sound level is much lower than the other discs. A minor annoyance to some,  I ended up purchasing a single copy of the Long Run from an independant dealer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the way it works. Adds are not bothersome. Definitely recommend this to everyone. Free is the is bomb. Can't go wrong with this app.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|If you loved the movie, you must own the soundtrack. This is a classic, you only get the basic songs from the hits.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|I love all of the Dr. Panda's!  I would have given this 5 stars but it keeps crashing on the fish tank and I can't seem to get past it.  All the others have worked so I feel confident they will have a fix for that soon :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Holy WOW!!! I love this series. This book kept me wanting more,  I like how they struggle make it work between them. How they make time for each other. I honestly can't wait for more.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I like it much better than the 1st. there is a lot of characters.also the1st froze up a lot this one dosn't
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So grateful to whoever posted the refund info, very angry with the author and no longer will read this novella series. Go take advantage of someone else.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was seriously like trying to squeeze water out of a dry well. I tried.  I just couldn't make it happen. Bared to You and Reflected to You were such good reads--full of angst, heartache, mystery, and killer love scenes. I waited months for Entwined only to find that it was a book without a plot made up of bogus filler scenes. I have numerous friends who were waiting to read this book right along with me, and when I told them that at 40% not a single thing had happened, they were like WTH.  Bottom line, it was written in a way where the entire story was dried up before it even began.  How this book received any 5-stars is a serious mystery. What is really sad, is that this book could have made this trilogy kick some serious reading butt, but instead it made the series crash and burn. And now it is going to be dragged out further??????? Um...no.  I actually was hoping that Eva would have cheated with Brett or that Gideon would have impregnated Corrine, something...anything...just so we could have felt and seen some angst. There was virtually no plot whatsoever. And then all of these random characters and scenes that did nothing to help the storyline. So lame.  The only thing that makes me feel better is that Amazon fully returned my money and I get to move on to Shy and Hop and the Chaos gang. Thank GOD.<br /><br />Here is my breakdown of this book:<br /><br />Angst:  None<br />Heartache:  None<br />Mystery:  None<br />Big Moments:  None<br />Scenes worth discussing:  None<br />Character development:  None<br />Sex:  Way too much, every other page, unrealistic and over the top<br /><br />Sorry Sylvia.  If it is any consolation, I loved your first two books.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game ex dpt when it freezes.... keep up the good work..... need more updates I play everyday more chips daily please
B000FCKPHG|5.0|first read it when my daughter was 8 and in piano...i said she had a &#34;gift&#34;...little did i know that is a hallmark of the fixed mindset.  this philosophy is applicable in all areas of life to all people.  i share it with others everywhere i go!
B00CH87HF4|1.0|This game has so many bugs that are infuriating to many players and has even led to uninstallation by quite a few people. If you do decide to download or try the game, make sure you read the complaints on the forums to know what you're dealing with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I wasn't really expecting the level of difficulty this game had. Is heard of Temple Run before, but this was the first I'd played. It's a great, solid, tough endurance game, and I'm hooked.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day did it for me again.  I loved this book.  Could not put it down.  It had a perfect mixture of angst, loving moments and sex.  The story flowed flawlessly to me.  I personally can not wait for the continuation of Ava and Gideon's story, hopefully we will not have to wait nearly as long!  Great job Sylvia!!!!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|All in all I am pleased with the new Megadeth record \\"Super Collider\\". There is a song or two on it that has a different vibe or feel to it. I do recommend this though. I purchased this from Best Buy because it had 3 bonus tracks, two studio cuts and a live track from Countdown To Extinction. The 3D cover is really cool. I have heard reports of the bonus tracks being hidden on some pressings of the regular version. Enjoy!
B000O14VAU|1.0|(I have seen Underworld several times, and ADORE THIS MOVIE!!!)<br />i'm REALLY DISAPPOINTED in the way the streaming is working....<br />the movie will be playing nicely, and then all of a sudden, it just stops and reverts back to the<br />main screen!!!  this happens SOOO OFTEN NOW, I AVOID USING THE STREAMING<br />program. sad, really, because there are quite a few movies i would<br />like to see! :( AND I HAVE ALREADY PAID MY ANNUAL FEE....!<br />the other problem for me is, i will build a list in my &#34;watchlist&#34;, and then when i get to<br />one of the movies, which i have been waiting to see....it's been REMOVED FROM THE<br />STREAMING PROGRAM!!!  that is such a let down!  either don't offer those movies<br />or LEAVE THEM IN THE PROGRAM!!!  why are they taken away?!? i know it's all about the dollars, but GIVE<br />US A BREAK!!!  WE ARE YOUR MOST DEVOTED CUSTOMERS!  (otherwise, we would be like the<br />rest of the world, and stick with netflix!!!)<br />sorry to be so vehement about these problems, it's just, i praise amazon so whole heartedly, sooo<br />often, i feel when i am being ill-treated, i want you to know....  thank you for reading this,<br />and HOPEFULLY LOOKING INTO THESE PROBLEMS FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE YOUR<br />MOST ARDENTLY LOYAL CUSTOMERS.... :(
B0015DROBO|5.0|Definitely a good read. Great twists and turns trying to figure out just what happened. Recommend for all those who enjoy a mystery and suspense.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphic but there should be more mini games. I am having trouble getting to the free gems app. I think it should also be easier to earn more money.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wow! I couldn't put it down. Very intense. I guess Jacob killed Hope. It kind of made you guess if he did.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Super presentation. A wonderful well acted movie with outstanding music. Most enjoyable.  You did an outstanding  job in packaging a shipping.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I LOVE this game. I got it on my kindle because I have played it on my mom's phone, grandma's phone, and grandma's tablet<br />Once you get yoused to it it's really fun and easy. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An outstanding story. Kept me in suspense throughout  A real wild ending. Could never have guessed. Grisham is a marvelous writer .
B009NG1Q96|5.0|OMG you people out there should totally read this book. You will fall in love this book. I can't wait for the next one.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Being new to these games, found this just tough enough to keep me interested instead of frustrated and quitting too soon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Build whatever you can imagine while trying to stay alive. Almost endless possibilities, and updates are still coming. Also, dont listen to the people who rage about it and says it sucks because the new update isnt on the kindle yet, it will come. Apple always gets things first, so you just have to patient.
B00785P2QC|3.0|pretty annoying that so much of the game's goals are based on using the player as free advertising on facebook and other places, like leaving this review.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|It is honest to goodness telling of the early struggles and impressive journey to their success they are reaping today. They are really entering their golden years when the group is more important that the individual.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode is back! It took me a listen or two to get used to the new sound they were trying out with this album, but it was definitely worth it. Playing the Angel is perhaps my absolute favorite of their works, but Delta Machine is quickly finding itself in second place.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This book was better than AFFC only because of we got some POVs from the main characters but thats about it and deserved one more star compared to the last. As others have said the plot revolves mostly about characters getting to Meereen.<br /><br />No major battles are in this one because Martin decided to cut them both for the next book. If six years were required to write this then I very afraid of the story ever being completed. The arc with Quentyn Martell and some other minor characters could be complete removed with no effect on the story. There are too many minor characters in these last two book that should have been cut.<br /><br />The first three books have satifying endings while the fourth and fifth felt like a filler (anime term) books with characters getting into place for the next books. Martin is often compared with Robert Jordan and I think this book compares to The Path of Daggers in plot movement except with no battles. In WOT, Jordan started dragging and the series got boring like these fourth and fifth books. Also like Jordan he is dragging us along at a snails pace.<br /><br />Martin repeatedly uses the same phrases like, \\"Where do whores go?\\", \\"You know nothing Jon Snow\\", and \\"If I look back, I am lost\\" is getting annoying. The fourth and fifth books should have been condensed into one book with some major editing or the fifth included the battles in the North and Essos. If one of the major characters is not coming back in the next book then I am done with this series where no major characters are safe. Once with Ned Stark would have been fine but not this other cliffhanger in ADWD.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game... lots to do, keeps you busy... love city building games like this one. Bonus points for being free....keep up the great products...
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Great movie for my kids to watch, while you're trying to get caught up cleaning the kitchen, etc. Thank you...
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Really cute fun and challenging game. I love finding games that both my kids and I can enjoy. This is entertaining and kid friendly
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cromwell must have read our bad reviews of her last book. She picked up a little. Still not as good as hee first few Scarpetta books. Again a forced, not fleshed out ending. Might be time to retire Scarpetta. Or Cornwell.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|It uses the match up two at a time premise.  A storyline is included to get you into the mood of the game.  It is a quick easy game at the beginning at least.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|That one quote sums up Kaleb entirely. And when he said it I actually sighed. I didn't think I'd ever have a Nalini Singh book I loved more than Judd and Brianna 's story. KoS came very very close. But this one, Heart of Obsidian, was simply perfect.<br />I had moments that I cried, laughed and then went Aha! There was a moment when Kaleb mentions something and I was just in awe of how Ms. Singh tied it in. Those fans who have read all of the stories will know that moment when they read it. Its subtle but it leaves no doubt about the situation he 's talking about if you've read all the psy/changeling stories.<br />I especially liked Kaleb's reason for everything he does. Sahara is a truly exceptional match for him in every way. A lot of times even the strongest heroine will get, diminished I suppose, once she's matched with a book's hero. That doesn't happen here. Even better...Kaleb doesn't do the basic dominant male thing and try to show us hes stronger and therefore knows best in a situation. He not only never questions her strength and abilities he actively encourages Sahara to utilize them and freely admits that even as powerful as he is she will always be the stronger one. And not simply because he adores her and therefore wouldn't hurt her.<br />I will be rereading this book several times just as I do all my favorites. But Heart of Obsidian will top that list now.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I only watched it all the way through because my son recommended it, and it's important for me to be a supportive father.  But it was painful.<br />Even if recommended by your son, avoid this movie!
B00718Y3CA|3.0|I wont give away any of the movie if you haven't seen it but it's a great one!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The seller advertised this as a BluRay & DVD Combo pack and only sent me the BluRay disc, I wasn't too happy about that, but it's still a great movie!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First what's up with all the negative reviews???? This book was awesome I have waited a long time (8 months)to read it and yes I thought it would be the last one in the series but the more I read the more I knew it wasn't going to be over just yet and I was so happy about that their story is far from over I never want a good book to end Gideon and eva have come a long way I was so glad the book played out like it did they have worked through a lot of their problems but still have a few to go and now trying to figure out some of the mystery to some of the things going on I can't go into details without spoilers it keeps your attention  the book is far from boring but I noticed some people complaining about the author just trying to stretch the book out to make money I don't feel that way she is good at what she does and the story is great one of my favorites it's not like you can read this or any of her books in 30 minutes like some I have read and paid to much for but any way's it's worth the price, buy it read it  you'll love it if you liked the other ones and sylvia please hurry with the next one that's the only down fall is waiting

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read and enjoyed his first two books.  I read 'The Kite Runner' twice about a year apart.  I think he has an amazing story telling ability and I find myself quickly absorbed in his characters and their inter-related adventures.  I probably will reread 'And The Mountains Echoed' because I am enjoying it so much.

B00138F8NC|5.0|It's a great album, from start to finish, Bowie is at his best, surrounded by capable talent, he weaves and excellent album dealing with the modern worlds oddness (as usual) each song leads well into the next, and it's capped by some great interludes that tell and interesting story.  The music is more 90's style, but backed with the old sensibilities of Mr Bowie, and it works, it works well, very under appreciated, but certainly worth a listen to any Bowie aficionado, or anyone that appreciates the quirky, artistic work of the 90's, of which David Bowie was such a huge influence on.

1439199388|5.0|This is now my 2nd favorite health-related book I've ever read (behind Perfect Health Diet). I first heard about it when I heard Chris Kresser's podcast with Velasquez-Manoff.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at how our bodies have evolved with microbes and parasites, and how our immune system is keenly tuned to tolerate them. The author discusses how our cleanliness has led to the current epidemic of allergies and autoimmune diseases which was nearly absent in our \\"dirtier\\" past. He discusses the seemingly lack of these afflictions in rural and less-developed parts of the world, such as people raised on farms and in more primitive societies, while those in developed areas suffer from a rampant spread. He sites hundreds of research studies and books (43 pages of references) and many anecdotal stories (including inflicting himself with a hookworm).<br /><br />One of the more fascinating aspects of his research is the evolutionary aspect of the immune system and these symbiotic organisms. He discusses an evolutionary lineage of life with microbes from your great-grandmother, to your time in the womb, to your childhood, and all the way to adulthood and old age. He shows how your great-grandmother's life and your experience in the womb can cause effects in adulthood.<br /><br />This book is densely packed with amazing research and stories. It's very well-written and reads like a novel. I plan on applying what I've learned in this book to my life and family's (when I have one). I've learned not to be overly-worried about cleanliness (that's not to say I'm never going to wash my hands again; I DO work in a hospital). I plan on getting out in nature more. I'll be walking barefoot in the grass (which I'm already doing a lot). I want to visit a farm soon, because being exposed to other animals will introduce more microbes to you. If/when I have a family, I want to ensure my wife get's out in nature and visits farms while pregnant. I will ensure my child also visits farms and plays outside. I won't be dumping Purell on her/him all the time (or ever). And of course I'll be sure everyone in my family eats a diverse diet including plenty of fermented foods with a probiotic supplement. I currently get probiotics from fermented foods, goat kefir, a greens supplement with probiotics, and a probiotic pill which I take once a week (kind of for insurance).<br /><br />I strongly recommend EVERYONE reads this book!

B00BEXB18M|3.0|I've got just about everything Megadeth has recorded. Super Collider is a throwback to the mid 90s sound. Problem is Dave's voice hasn't improved, and some songs on here are downright ugly (title track especially). Kingmaker and Dance in the Rain are the 2 best tracks here, with Rain being one of the strongest songs they've done (imho). The rest is so-so, take it or leave it.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|First off: no, this does not sound like classic Megadeth. Nor does it sound like the last 4 albums, although it does bear some resemblance to 13 in that it's not as fast or as heavy.<br /><br />I won't do a track by track. I will say that there are some weaker songs, namely the title track and Burn. I do enjoy both tracks to an extent, and actually I think burn is a fun song.<br /><br />I think this album follows a musical arc: the first few songs are good, but not fantastic. Kingmaker is an exception, which is a great thrash/hard rock hybrid track and it's a great track to run to. But the next 3 songs are all only decent, not great. Built for war is repetitive and has some silly lyrics, but has a good overall riff and a neat middle section. The best of these songs is off the edge. It has a very VR feel to it, and a great middle section/solo section.<br /><br />The next few songs are incredible. Dance in the rain and beginning of sorrow are two of the absolute best tracks I've ever heard from this band. The songs are darker and heavier, with some thrash elements, but also some more pop sensibility. They also do some things harmonically that aren't usual for this band.<br /><br />The rest of the songs begin to drop off a little in the \\"incredible\\" factor, but are still mostly great songs. I actually have listened to the entire album several times for the last few days. It stays with you afterward.<br /><br />The style is more like traditional heavy metal, some pop-rock sensibilities, and some hard rock and thrash metal. It bears more resemblance to Youthanasia or Cryptic Writings era Megadeth. Some have said it sounds like risk, but that's idiotic...this album is actual heavy metal and has a lot of actual riffage. Risk was almost not metal at all.<br /><br />It's different, but this album has some of the most inspired and fresh material from Dave and co. in a long time. The last few albums have been good, but a bit formulaic. Not anymore.<br /><br />A lot of people will trash this because of some of the weaker tracks or because it's not classic Megadeth. Who really cares, though? Listen to the content, not the aesthetic, and you will find some good stuff here.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappoint  I love the first 2book but this one I could finish n the feat the two more book  I won't read cause I didn't like this book at all I really trey to like it but no
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was a pleasant surprise.  I had never heard of it before it was recommended to me on Amazon based on my past purchases.  I'm so glad I read it.  The story was lovely, sad & warm.  I highly recommend it.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|So far this cable does as it should. I just wish it were longer. I also dread having to replace it. How can Kindles work so well and Kindle (necessary) accessories work so poorly and die so quickly?
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|I could not be happier with this purchase. This album is dope upon dope and the vinyl just made it that much doper. The records and sleeve were in mint condition, the sleeve folds open like a book revealing some awesome artwork and a sturdy vinyl in either end, and it even came with a free mp3 download of the entire album, which didn't really help me as I already owned the digital version, but hey, this is the way to do it if you don't.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|My father took me to see this man in concert for a hospital benefit 25 years ago (I was 30yr old)...not looking forward to it at all.  He blew me away, I was so grateful for the experience.  Now, he comes out with this PERFECT CD, with perfect artist's to complete this journey.  I never knew, Dolly Parton could sing like this!  Enjoy the REAL music, not computerized crap.  Michael McDonald's voice w/Paul is great.  The outstanding Leon Russell is a thrill to hear...Patti LaBelle & Willie Nelson just make you push repeat.  Honestly, the song choices and awesome vocals, blow away Tony Bennet's duets CD's...by far, Paul Anka is MUCH BETTER!!!  More thought seems to have been put into this CD.

B003YFIUW8|3.0|Room, by Emma Donoghue, is a novel about many things. At the very heart of the story, we find Jack, a five year old narrator who tells the story of his living in captivity with his mother. Since he was young, Jack has been taught, by his mother, that the Room in which they are held is the entire extent of the world, and that everything outside isn't real. Like the narrator's misunderstanding of the world, you two will be misunderstood if you come into this novel thinking it's only about a boy, his mom, and a room. This novel tests relationships, shows a mother's love for her son, and really treis to understand some of the more unpleasant aspects of our society.<br /><br />But you probably knew all of that entering into this review. You look at the front page of this book and every review is 5 stars. So I'm guessing you're wondering why/how I gave it 3 stars? Well, before I begin, let me clarify something. I actually give this book 3.5 stars, but as Amazon only allows whole numbers, I had to make the decision whether or not I wanted to round the 3.5 up or down. As I thought over what exactly could push this book either way, I realized a lot of things, both good and bad, about the novel. Eventually, however, I had to give it a 3.<br /><br />If you know the premise of Room, then you basically have read the entire first half of the book. These 150 something pages detail the day-to-day life of Jack and his mother, presented through Jack's gripping narration. But, with anything living in captivity, the activities of the prisoner are, if anything, tedious. In vivid detail, the reader slowly gets to watch Jack and Ma do everything over and over again. There is no strength in repetition here, however, Donoghue isn't building motif. Instead, what she produces is an incredibly slow, dull trek through well-imagined hell with the ocasional scary demon every few pages. Serving as an intro to this story, this section is very poor, but ultimately that is forgivable because it's kind of a necessary evil to understand the psyche of the characters.<br /><br />The next two paragraphs have mild spoilers.<br /><br />After the section about Room itself, Jack takes part in a pulse-pounding escape scene. And boy, is it fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat, reading it like a full blown thriller, and for a second, I thought this book was going to be a masterpiece. But the escape scene occurs in the very middle of the book, and you finish it, and start reading the \\"after\\" scenes, and you realize that the escape scene was the climax. And there's still two hundred pages left. Room is shaped like a very large, very flat isosceles triangle. You have the slow buildup of the Room on one side, the escape in the middle, and the slow winding down of re-immersion afterword.<br /><br />And boy, are the Re-immersion scenes boring. It's essentially just introducing Jack to things in the real world, and we watch him struggle to accept that they are, in fact, real. While interesting for about thirty pages, the rest of the long section proves incredibly boring as well, just slowly slogging through the outside world. Emma Donoghue does this with incredible imagination and attention to detail, but at the end of the day, a good writer can only make something slow and boring a certain amount of Good. And Donoghue did the best she could, but it's still not very enjoyable to read. I should note, however, there are some very, very emotional scenes in this half (specifically the interview scene and the scene with the real Grandfather), which unexpectedly made me tear up.<br /><br />End of Spoilers.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with Room is also what I find most interesting about it: the narrator. Jack is a five year old, and from the first page he is instantly believable as a narrator and horribly out of place. Jack constantly waivers between being of above-average intelligence and being borderline autistic. For a kid that can use complex metaphors and long words like \\"omnivore\\", he takes an awfully long time understanding the severity of the situation or the existence of something outside Room. And maybe that is how developmental problems work, but for a novel, the experience is jarring at best. You, as a reader, come to love and car for Jack and his Ma, but you will be ready to scream in frustration as Jack fails to comprehend his mother's orders during the escape or continues to demand being breast fed long after he is informed that its not normal. Towards the end of the novel, the one character you really become interested in is the Mother, and how she had the ability to even keep Jack in the first place. Unfortunately, Jack, as a narrator, can provide no insight into this, or anything else, really, that isn't him, and a lot of it has to be inferred by the reader. But, because of Jack's ADD like tendencies and juvenile voice, the clues for the reader to pick up on are virtually nonexistent.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy I read Room. It wasn't too long of a read, it flowed well, I was interested in the action, etc. But it wasn't quite as \\"wow\\" worthy as everyone else seems to think. In the end, I have to give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.ke \\"omnivore\\", he takes an awfully long time understanding the severity of the situation or the existence of something outside Room.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it and read the remaining four books in about a week. I frankly cannot wait for book six to be released.  Like any book it isn't for everyone, but I obviously found it very enjoyable.  The books are quick reads and are not overly complex. I only give five star ratings to books that I feel are literary greats.  This book and the rest of the series are very good, but not great. I highly recommend that if you enjoy fantasy then you need to give this book a try.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Boomers are the last generation to see improved life expectancy and prosper from overall quality of life.The never ending quest for profit, greed drives the corporate model that has created poison they call food. Most will not care or notice till they get sick, or there kids, maybe close family member, it will effect everyone in one way or another rich and poor sooner or later. For those in the city try living on what you grow. Respect, real value, appreciation and perspective cannot be gained with such a disconnect from what you put into your bodies.
1400069289|3.0|The first few chapters were really interesting, and then most of the rest were fillers. I was hoping to know more about what really goes on in the brain when it forms and keeps habits, which this book does a half-assed job of.<br /><br />Too much fluff. It goes on and on and on describing businesses and their employees, which is great, but it doesn't really belong in this book. Some of the stories hardly are related to habits at all.

030789701X|4.0|I love it already from the bit I have read so far. It has lots of great information about Skyrim. The hard cover is a bit cheap. The top corners of it got messed up in shipping and the bridge got wrinkled as I looked through it. I would recommend not paying the extra for the hard cover but getting the soft cover version. The hard cover does have the bookmarks though and that is helpful. It does cover a lot. I will use it a lot for my current saves and I will have a character some day where I use nothing but the guide.

1439163154|2.0|I can't say I expected tons from James Franco. The transition from actor to author isn't usually an easy one to make.<br /><br />This book is basically a collection of a dozen stories, usually around 10 pages or so each, sometimes broken into a few parts, about growing up in Palto Alto, California. The stories range from the sexual records of pre-teens to stories of near-rape, violence, and lots of legal violations. I can't say this book was anything short of exciting. Didn't have me flipping through the pages, anxious for the next story to begin, but I was able to get through the whole thing feeling reasonably entertained.<br /><br />James Franco did do a pretty decent job of capturing teen attitudes and how strongly they vary depending on the person. I could feel the infatuation rising off some of the characters, the misery when stuck in the slump of depression, the desperation and fear of getting in trouble with parents, police, teachers. He portrayed the racism, sexism and ugly thoughts running through many kids' heads, even if they know what they're thinking is wrong.<br /><br />It was an interesting premise--taking a town you grew up in and writing about it in a candid, honest way, as Franco delivered to his readers. We got to delve into his memories, readers can be reasonably sure Franco was describing a detailed account of his own childhood, along with many of his friends' and girlfriends'. His attitude towards Palto Alto (less than affectionate) was a refreshing change from the nostalgia and patriotism many people feel towards their hometowns.<br /><br />Great premise, poor delivery.<br /><br />The execution of Palo Alto was awful. Many of the incidents were over-dramatized and saturated with unrealistic material. Basically it's a bunch of kids, most under 15 (eighth-graders), smoking, drinking, having sex at wild all-night parties, driving around recklessly, and breaking so many laws they face community service, jail time and mean probation officers. One thought running through my mind throughout the book was, WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?? Who lets their kids mess up this bad before even hitting puberty? Adults had less than a starring role in this story, if you're a fan of strong parental guidance, I wouldn't recommend this book.<br /><br />Some of the stories were extremely lewd (\\"Chinatown\\") and others were downright unbelievable (\\"Camp\\"). One particularly annoying habit James Franco had was trying too hard to be insightful and deep. He included lots of little unnecessary details meant to be touching, but instead falling flat.<br /><br />Another thing that can really get under a reader's skin was the points of view Franco used. I say points, plural, for good reason. While staying in first person, the reader was inside the minds of a different character per story--or so it seemed. Sometimes you'd have repeats, (the character Ryan seemed to be James as a teenager, so he got the most time of anyone) and sometimes it would be a female perspective, or a side character whose name we'd never heard before. The relevance of the varying narrators was questionable, I feel like Franco could have easily gotten his point across without this system. It's commendable Franco tried it out, but once again, horrible execution. I was often asking myself who's eyes I was seeing the world through, usually this wasn't revealed to readers until the end (in another failed attempt at depth). It was confusing and overall very frustrating.<br /><br />In a nutshell, James Franco should seriously stick to acting.hought running through my mind throughout the book was, WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS??

B008XBCJ34|5.0|This review is for the 3D version and I have broken it into two parts, the film and the picture quality.<br /><br />The Film<br />-When I first saw this movie in the theater I was truly blow away by the epic scope of the story and the concept of as whole. While the story is not original, no story really is, the execution certainly was and it is an extremely entertaining film. James Cameron is an epic film maker and that's what this film is in every way.<br /><br />The Picture Quality<br />-This is by far the best 3D film I have watched on my television and really what I would call reference quality, even better than The Avengers, which is saying a lot. Even if you are not crazy about the film you need to own this to fully appreciate your 3D television.

B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Kept my attention, the interaction between Kaleb and the heroine is fascinating and intimate scenes are very sexy, but I can't see Kaleb as a good leader for an entire race. He simply lacks the any real empathy, remorse, or guilt over ANYTHING he does except to one person. The whole story line of this series has emphasized the value of emotion and honor. Kaleb is emotionally stunted - with VERY good reason- but except for the one person who is \\"his\\" and who he would \\"never hurt\\" he was quite ready to destroy millions of innocent people (-well MAYBE not those under 16 years old)! Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. He admits to killing or coercing anyone else who has or will get in his way. (Threatening the college age daughters of a human rival?) Ick. Powerful? Yes. Deadly? Yes. Someone Anthony or Sophia or Zie Zen or even Vasic should have to be ruled by? No! Those people have been working for the freedom of their people. Kaleb has been working for the freedom of ONE person.  He wants to be the absolute ruler of the psynet, has only one person who he will answer to and behave for, and if she is hit by a bus - goodbye world????? She is his moral compass. Scary. Left LOT of questions.  What about previous story of needing empaths to fix the psynet? Where are all these empaths?  What is the group of 10 rebels up to? Why is Nikita \\"not silent\\"? (quote from Kaleb), what about Sophia, who anchors the only wholly sane place in the net?, what will happen to DarkRiver or SnowDancer? how will the psynet be fixed? This book doesn't go there at all, so hopefully the next one will!

B00C1CO0XS|4.0|George Benson sounds EXACTLY like Nat Cole in this new set. It's uncanny - especially so since his singing comes over as just ass sincere, heartfelt and alive as Cole's originals. Most tracks use the original arrangements as their foundation, and then expand from there - but everything stays perfectly within the Great American Songbook genre.<br />So why 'only' four stars? Because the repertoire contains a few songs I dislike (Nature Boy, ugh!) and the selections are pretty predictable (many other listeners won't be bothered by this). Plus, the arrangements could have been a bit more adventurous without breaking the boundaries of the genre. Plus, some more Nat Cole Trio stylings would also have been welcome.<br />But if you're in the market for a first-rate, brilliantly performed, traditional tribute album, this will hit the spot perfectly.
1451695195|4.0|Does consciousness cease when the brain dies? &#34;No&#34; says Dr. Alexander.<br />His book is based on his personal experience of brain death. Provocative and a helpful contribution to a body of literature that suggests that consciousness continues after death.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Could only have been written by someone who understood combat and the special brand of craziness it engenders. Great read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A fun and different game that consumed me. I enjoyed the elaborate puzzles and couldn't put the room down once I'd started playing.

B003UESJ9M|1.0|This movie had a severe lack of plot and story line.  Beau couldn't figure out who he wanted, Kelly or Chiles.  The movie never did address the \\"affair\\" with James and Chiles.  Was there one?  What actually happened to Beau's and Chiles's career?  UGH!  I'm so glad this movie is over.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I woke up at midnight to start reading this book.  I was having such a good time and then turned to the next page and NOTHING.  As with everyone else I returned it.  Books need to END at some point and this was the point, but no ending.  I will NEVER read anything from this author again.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Another replacement from VHS to DVD. Well worth the $$ spent for the replacement. It's so much better this way.
