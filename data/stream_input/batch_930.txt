B001M4YZ90|4.0|This movie is HILARIOUS- full of sophisticated humor.  It's like The Godfather without Don Corleone and none of his family drama.  Just a funny gangster flick, but not too over the top.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|That was the most long winded book I have ever read. I skimmed the last few chapters because he had pounded that conversation into our heads throughout the entire book. The unnecessary business concerning Noetic Science served absolutely no purpose in advancing in the story. I kept saying out loud to my husband \\"when does this story end?\\". To Dan Brown's credit, he does include historical background in his books that enhance and enrich the stories. But, dear God, get to the point! I loved \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and so I am disappointed with this latest tome.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Radiant Records came through and I received my copy in the mail on 10/26/09 as advertised.     This is unmistakably Transatlantic. The musicianship is superb, as one would expect given the players involved with the project.  Interestingly after the fourth listen, I really think that Pete (Bass) shined on this one. All of the players have their brilliant moments, and their collective talents come together to form a very creative and cohesive effort, one which will take many listens in order to fully digest - Just like all good prog.
B000OJAE1C|5.0|After a friend recommended this book to me, I picked it up at the library and began reading a story that was so full of mysteries I had a hard time putting it down each night.  I read a few chapters daily and was constantly surprised by the adventures that were revealed in each chapter.<br /><br />The main character Daniel was endearing, and all of his relationships were wonders.  The book is like an adult Harry Potter adventure without the witchcraft.  It's not the type of book that I normally read, but it was a book that completely engaged me and left me feeling satisfied at the end.<br /><br />This book is a true work of art.  It has many components and should appeal to any book reader.  The Shadow of the Wind is good from the title on the cover to the very ending.
0810983915|4.0|Another great Diary of a Wimpy Kid book! This book is 217 pages but, like I did, you'll get carried away and read it in one night. You do not have to read the first book to understand the others. This book is for boys and girls and I think nobody younger than 7 should read this book. Please take my advice and buy this book!
0060090367|1.0|It was absolutely painful to get through this book about a self-obsessed young woman who can't see beyond her own pathetic life. I wanted to shake her and slap her into reality. Pages and pages of heartache about her forlorn lovelife are just plain depressing. I really felt such hatred for this character that the \\"humor\\" fell flat for me. There are far better ways to spend your time than reading such drivel. This book is so bad that I won't even try to sell it at my garage sale. I'd hate for someone else to waste their time with it!
0307266303|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I felt like it was written specifically for me. I am a sports chiro and see lots of runners; the first thing I did upon finishing it was to place it in the waiting room with the note, \\"All injured runners must read this book!\\" The personal story was great. The chapters on the development and history of running shoes and on the current theories about how human evolution was influenced by running totally blew me away. He basically summarized everything I've been researching over the past few years in my own personal quest to enjoy running again. I was so inspired that on my last long run I took off my shoes and ran around barefoot (in the grass) for the last half hour. Can't say enough good things about this book- buy it!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD series. The characters are complex and the storyline is delightful. I am always looking for a new tv series to watch and now I'm hooked.
0060254920|4.0|This story chronicles a very bad boys day of imaginative roll playing and final acceptance of his place in the real world. I loved reading it to my children and watching as their little faces lit up in recognition of, perhaps, adventures they had endured during their own 'bad' periods of behavior. I give it an emphatic 'BRAVO'

B002ELM5HY|5.0|Former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler has rewarded his fans once again with an outstanding solo album that bears repeated listening.  \\"Get Lucky\\" is as good as any of the previous six albums Knopfler has put out in the past dozen years (including his collaboration with Emmy Lou Harris).  \\"Get Lucky,\\" perhaps more than any of the other efforts, revisits his Celtic folk roots, but adds the distinctive Knopfler touch, fusing many musical styles.    As always, it is strong story-telling that lifts his singable melodies to memorable heights.  The opening number, \\"Border Reiver,\\" is the album's first single.  It is reminiscent of his best rock tunes, including \\"Money for Nothing\\" (with Dire Straits) and \\"Boom Like That\\" (from his Shangri-La album).  Knopfler introduces us to many intriguing characters in the 11 new songs presented here.  My personal favorite character is his uncle who was killed in World War 2 while playing the bagpipes to lead his Scottish regiment into battle, now immortalized in the song \\"Piper to the End.\\"  My favorite song is \\"Remembrance Day,\\" that movingly (and with a perfectly used children's choir) recalls fallen soldiers he has known.  (Make sure to Google \\"Morris Men,\\" who are also honored in this song.)  Knopfler also pays tribute to John Monteleone, the craftsman who made Knopfler's guitar and is famous for his handmade mandolins.    Expect to fall in love with this fine new album.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's books.  They're full of interesting historical facts, although sometimes I wonder which facts are real and which are fiction. But, it does inspire me to learn more about things that he writes about. This book starts out very good and builds to a climax about three-quarters of the way through it.  But then it just settles back down, and the rest of the book seems to bog down with drawn-out conversations, and never builds to what I consider a satisfying end. This book was okay, but my very favorite book of Mr. Brown's is Angels and Demons, followed closely by Deception Point.
0882709194|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone interested on the origin of the species.   Everyone should read this book and learn from it.  Finally, the truth is told!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I've mostly only used the triggers so far with a racing game but let me tell you that they have been a boon.  You can feather the throttle so much easier with these triggers.

B002KVSJ7S|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing just one track. I am thrilled with the entire CD; ALL the songs are great. I think Mika is a fresh new talent with a sound that is pleasing to all age groups.
B002RTJ52G|5.0|This album took me completely by surprise..the Spandau Boys are back, with 2 new wonderful tracks and new renditions of 11 of their hits from the 80s. \\"Once More\\", the title track and opener, is the first new released song from them in 20 years, and showcases the band back in full form and in classic Spandau Style. If you enjoyed their big hits from the 80s, such as \\"True\\" and \\"Gold\\" and yearn for 80s style pop, you will absolutely fall in love with this song as it has all the elements of the band that made them famous: emotive, soulful, heartfelt lyrics and hooky pop sensibilities. Equally as fresh are the reworked versions of the older songs, which are given a facelift with a fresh, more organic feel, sounding less dated then their heavy synth-laden ancestors. Highlights for me include \\"To Cut a Long Story Short\\" and \\"I'll Fly for You.\\"  All in all, all songs are performed and executed to perfection, not a dull track in the lot, with an energy, vibrancy and production that is first class and reaffirms to me that Spandau Ballet must have \\"True\\"-ly been one of the best bands of the 80s generation!
B002JTHFUS|5.0|outstanding collection in this set as w/ any b-sides too  the two versions of \\"WIRE\\" are totally impressive as being \\"Yoshino blossom & disapearing act\\"   two yrs ago when the re release of the Joshua tree came out  really thought Unforgettable fire  would be in the same year!  now it has finally come out thru U2  in true fashion.     on the dvd archive footage  they should have had the whole Croke park 85 show included terrific show & they did Springsteen's my Hometown     must have addition from the 80's   don't push me to fall...tonight,tonight
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown's writing has not only not improved it has gotten worse.  The plot is weak, the writing is poor, and the book is an overall disappointment.  I will not read any of Dan Brown's work in the future.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|I won't review the movie; if you want a review, go to imdb. That being said, I saw this in theaters, purchased the 2-disc collectors DVD when it was released, and now that I've gone Blu-ray, am replacing that DVD. So I guess I like this movie.    In upconversion, the DVD suffered from haloing; where bright whites tended to unnaturally bleed into adjacent colors. Like when a person is backlit with a bright light, but is not dark from the front, the edges of that person would glow. I found this extremely distracting. The Blu-ray solves this problem, but the graininess in darker scenes is about the same. Scenes are sharper, but when they're in the back of the store, for example, the shadows are still full of grain.     I'm glad I replaced the DVD, but am a little disappointed in the grainy artifacts that still exist in the transfer.
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|This movie is a little bit darker and a lot more cerebrel than the first three. Aside from that it is pretty good. We enjoyed it.

0316069906|5.0|Early in Eating Meat, Foer shares an anecdote of his starving Jewish grandmother, fleeing the Nazis and offered pork by a kind peasant. She is dying of starvation but rejects the pork, explaining, \\"If nothing matters, there's nothing to save.\\" While Foer loves his grandmother, the story-teller, the life-giver, and the lover of kosher beef and chicken, he uses her quote as a sort of epitaph throughout his book to pave the way for his conversion to vegetarianism, a conversion that separates him from a lot of his family traditions that define who he is. For him and many others, including myself, the relentless and unspeakable cruelty that animals suffer because they are treated like commodities to be savored for a few minutes is something that deeply matters and we should not willfully be ignorant or deny animal suffering.<br /><br />Eating Animals is a deeply personal book, propelled, Foer explains, by the birth of his son. What kind of person does he want his son to be? For Foer, raising his son to empathize with animals and as a result not eat their slaughtered flesh is the kind of son he wants to raise and of course he must change as a parent to lead in this manner.<br /><br />The book is very nuanced, never dogmatic, but keeps a crystal-eyed focus on animal suffering, including firsthand accounts of what happens in the slaughterhouses. For me, the book's most moving passage is when Foer asks the owner of a slaughterhouse if there was ever a time he had difficulty killing an animal. The slaughterhouse owner confessed there was a time a cow licked his face and leaned against him for twenty minutes in a display of affection to his killer that made the slaughterhouse owner pause. But sadly he killed the cow anyway. I shared this anecdote with my college composition students and asked them if they could kill the cow after being licked in the face and 95% of them said they could not. I hope Foer's book, enjoying lots of buzz, justifiably so, has such an influence on millions and millions of people.ions of people.
0385504225|5.0|Brown writes a magnificent story.  History, suspense, relentless action.  There's occasionally an aloud \\"OMG!\\" surprise.

0979127661|5.0|Chesterton's 'Orthodoxy' is his spiritual autobiography and as such does not explain why any other person believes, but rather why HE believes.  Still, important strands of thought are present that many readers (this one included) find compelling.  This is in large part because many of the philosophies GK is responding to are ones present today.  Writing in the early 1900s, it was in the midst of optimistic scientism and euphoric humanism, and not too far removed from Darwin and his Malthusian outlook.  And, coming before the ravages of the 20th century- before Hitler's eugenics program and the communist purges made the consequences of such thinking obvious- Chesterton's condemnations, coming in hints and allusions as he traces his thinking, appear prophetic.    This particular edition was clean and crisp, with no extra commentary, for a pure Chesterton experience.  (It does have an index at the end which some may find useful).
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I would reccommend this book to anyone who loved Dan Browns other books. It is written terrifically and shouldnt be considered as controversial as the other reviews make it seem. This book doesnt denounce faith in anyway.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|If you loved her Fearless cd, then this album is for you! I like all the new songs especially Jump Then Fall. Untouchable is a heartfelt song with a catchy chorus. The piano version of Forever & Always is great and seems a little slower than the original, but still good. Superstar is a moderately-paced and interesting song that is supposedly about Joe Jonas. This album has a ton of bonus content with music videos, pictures from her Fearless tour, the video for Thug Story, and behind the scenes content. Overall, it's a great cd and worth the money.
B002R0EIVI|5.0|Great to know that the KINGS' fans have an opportunity to obtain a copy of his last performance.  Even if it is just a rehearsal, someone like me, who didn't get the chance to see him perform live, I can cherish his talent in this way.  \\"HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DIED!!!\\"
0385504225|3.0|I live near DC so it is always fun to pick up a book like this and read about places I have visited or seen, know about, or could visit.    This particular Robert Langdon novel took me longer to get into than The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, but once I did, I enjoyed it.  It was fun, and that is about all I can say.    There were some issues for me with clarity, some things never really got cleared up.  For example, Inoue Sato-Director of the Office of Security for the CIA, is she part of the female break off group of the Freemasons or not?  it was alluded to numerous times in the book, but we never got a clear answers.  The masons seem to be a go to secret group for books and/or movies like this (National Treasure and From Hell spring to mind) and I don't mind that, but give me something that the others haven't.  Something new.    My one beef is Brown's villians.  WHY are they always....odd..for lack of a better word.  We have had the Albino Monk, the 'brothers' from Angels and Demons, and then we have the Tattooed 'monster' from this book.  I think it is easy to see the 'monster' in those that do not fit in, that don't blend, unfortunately it is usually the monsters we don't see that are the scariest, and Brown doesn't seem to utilize that sort of slippery slope.    this was a fun book, what more do we need!

141654917X|3.0|Picoult sets up a fascinating framework for a  very complex, heart wrenching story.  The parents of Kate,  who has a rare form of Leukemia, with a high mortality rate, are determined to have another child who would be a genetic match for her.  They conceive Anna, who has spent her entire life donating parts of herself to keep her sister alive.<br />At thirteen, Anna is expected, in a last ditch effort, under a highly unlikely successful outcome, to donate one of her kidneys to her sister.  Instead, she sues her parents for medical emancipation.<br />Most of what follows is predictable.  However, the ending is so bad, and could have so easily been avoided, that it is unforgivable.  If you read this book, stop reading it after the judge has rendered his decision.  If you can't resist finishing it, and you're as annoyed, as I predict you will be, read several of the other somewhat negative reviews afterwards, and realize you could have been spared your grunts.
0061339202|5.0|Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, (known as `Mike' and for the record his family name is pronounced \\"cheek-sent-me-high-ee\\", His name comes from \\"Saint Michael from the province of Csik,\\" Csik being originally a Hungarian province) is one of the world's leading researchers on Positive Psychology. The author of numerous books and published papers, Flow is recognized as his most influential book and has had a far reaching impact, selling millions of copies, and used extensively in academia, business, sports, psychology and life coaching.<br /><br />Flow integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology, and spirituality to;<br /><br />\\"Present general principles along with concrete examples of how some people have used these principles, to transform boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment.\\"<br /><br />Our Professor describes his work as the effort \\"to study what makes people truly happy.\\" The emphasis here is on the word \\"truly\\"--because to him, happiness is not simply an emotional state. The happiness he points to involves the continual challenge to go beyond oneself as part of something greater than one's own self-interest.<br /><br />Mihaly acknowledges throughout that Flow research is deep rooted in Ancient Wisdom starting with Aristotle's the good life. Aristotle's model of the good life is `Eudaimonia', \\"the state of being well and doing well,\\" often translated as meaning `happiness'. The Taoist philosophy of `doing without doing', Yogi traditions, Jesuit teachings, heavy reliance on Stoic and more recent philosophy and his own extensive scientific research of which he documents many examples, including in the notes section reference to a `pot pourri' of high achievers.<br /><br />We are introduced to how the principles of Flow can help us overcome external influences by so doing this also positively impacts, first of all ourselves, and then our experiences with close \\"Full\\" interpersonal relationships, good health, wisdom, awe, maturity, charity, moral development, self-control, purposeful striving, creativity, and professional accomplishments.

B002H3F7F6|4.0|This album has the opposite tone of 2008's Yo-Yo Ma's bright and cheerful winter CD. Sting and his musicians create an atmosphere of darkness, cold, seriousness, and silence. Some of the songs are in the classical domain, e.g., Michael Praetorius, Henry Purcell, John Dryden, Franz Schubert, and J.S. Bach, which I surmise brought the support of the Deutschegrammophone label. Other pieces are traditional, contemporary, and also Sting's own compositions. I like Sting's quiet and contemplative singing and the acoustic instrumentation is well arranged and performed.  The Middle Eastern oud and ney in There Is No Rose of Such Virtue is a nice touch. This is private music, however, not for the crowd, unless your holiday guests need to wind down. Indeed, the only \\"up\\" song is Soul Cake, a Paul Stookey work, although the moderate tempo The Burning Babe by Chris Wood does raise the energy level. The poem, Christmas at Sea, put to music by Sting and Mary Macmaster, hence its Celtic flavor, is my favorite of the album. I suggest to effectively counter the gloom and gravitas, play the album louder than usual and appreciate the fine musicianship. The album's concept itself deserves kudos.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I love this soundtrack - it is an awesome mix of tempos, genres, and artists.  From the well-known Killers to the lesser-known Anya Marina, this album truly delivers.  The lyrics, the melodies, and the emotions from the soundtrack evoke the same feelings as the book.  Being a huge fan of the Twilight books, I have high expectations for bringing the text to life, but hopefully armed with this authentic soundtrack, the movie will deliver.      Highly recommend for Twilight and non-Twilight fans alike.  You will not be disappointed.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I love Juno for reasons not only great in number, but reasons that are hard to express.  Firstly, Ellen Page is a likable teen girl who just happens to be pregnant. I can't imagine anyone other than Ellen playing Juno. Juno is a sarcastic, at times dead pan, normal girl who have her freaky quirks. Her sarcasm only hides the depth of emotion that she has, and Juno rarely lets anyone in her inner sanctum. She knows love, pain, both emotionally and physically, has high hopes for her baby, which is why she gives the baby up, and shows the true maturity it takes to raise a child. She knows that there are better things for her baby that she can't give and that there are things she wants for herself that would not be possible if she had a child. She is a child herself, just with a hardened, skewed vision of life.  Secondly, Bleeker is a cute and has an innocence to him that you don't always see in teens in movies. He loves Juno and wants to be there for her but it unsure of how to be and just does what he can to get by in the film but that generally means not sticking up for himself.   Next, I like that the movie looks differently at teen pregnancy. I am not saying that being a pregnant is easy, should be glorified or is a wonderful thing, but it is still a pregnancy, which is considered a blessing and a beautiful thing. Juno shows that it isn't just a have an abortion or \\"screw up\\" your life type of situation. People can find blessed miracles in garbage dumps of situations.   I recommend this movie for EVERYONE.

B001SN78JO|1.0|I was forced to watch \\"Yes Man\\" on a bus traveling from Washington, DC to New York City. There was no way to avoid it (the sound was up full blast, the screen right in my face), although I wish there had been. I guess the bus driver could have chosen a worse movie than this jerry-built contraption for Jim Carrey, but not by much. The story involves a depressed, negative man (Carrey) who is forced by a self-help guru (Terence Stamp) to agree to everything everyone asks him to do. If \\"Yes Man\\" were merely a typical Hollywood \\"comedy\\" that mistook frenzy for laughs, I could have borne it. But \\"Yes Man\\" crosses over far too often into the realms of the offensive. The \\"jokes\\" include one of the most distasteful sex scenes in cinematic history (you'll know it when you see it) and a scene between Carrey and a German shepherd that conjures images of that perennial laff riot, Abu Ghraib. Carrey flounders in the awful script, as do other talented actors such as Stamp, Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper and Fionnula Flanagan. I would advise even die-hard Carrey fans to skip this one.
0882709194|5.0|This excellent 150th Anniversary Edition of Origin of Species has a new 50 page introduction that examines what science has shown us since Darwin published his musings. As Darwin himself wrote in Origin of Species, \\"Why, if species have descended from other species by fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?...As by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the Earth?\\" Comfort then lays out the statistics of the millions of fossils found and the dearth of transitional forms, just as Darwin feared.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Comfort quotes many eminent scientists, such as Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute and the scientist who led the team that cracked the human genome, with their insights into how modern science has informed our view of Darwin's theory.<br /><br />You can read the entire book online and decide for yourself: [...]
B00005JMJG|5.0|I always enjoy movies that are a little out there. Eternal Sunshine passes with flying colors.   This movie is relatable, but not in a way that makes it boring.  We all know the story of having love, losing love, and wanting to make that pain go away.  This movie takes that and twists it so that you can see what life would really have been like without them and how it would be better and worse and why ultimately you are who you are because of what you got out of the person and how you helped mold them.  I like Jim Carrey and it was wonderful to see him take on a more serious role and do so superbly. Kate Winslet can play crazy and out there like no one's business. Kirsten Dunst adds a young fresh twist to the movie along with Elija Wood and Mark Ruffalo plays geeky just perfectly.   I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a mind trip and/ or a movie that is serious without being totally depressing.
B001CZVVVY|5.0|I entirely agree with M Van Loon.  This is a marvellous performance with superb singing from all the artists.  While it is probably unfair to single out any one performer I have to give specific praise to Netrebko, Schafer and Roschmann.  Simply gorgeous voices and all of these artists have such good acting ability that it brings a new dimension to opera.  Over the years having seen many Figaros I have to say that this one is in a league of its own.  As to the previous comment which critised the sparseness of the set, I would have to question the rationale of going to the opera. Is it to hear glorious music well sung and acted or is it to see beautiful costumes and colourful sets?  To my mind the minimalist staging concentrates the mind on the singing and the performance of the artists.  If I want to see authentic costumes I can always go to a museum!    It also has to be said that the quality of the Blu-ray is top notch.  Wonderful clarity and detail with stunning sound.  Nothing to dislike.      On a personal level I enjoyed the introduction of the Cherub acting as a sort of unauthodox 'guardian angel'. This is a graceful performance which added to my overall enjoyment of the performance.  I suppose that strict purists can always take issue with any deviation from the norm.  However, I like to regard opera as a continually developing art form.  New interpretations can often bring new life into familiar territory without diminishing the appeal of the original.    This disc also has very interesting interviews with the artists and selective excerpts from rehearsal.  The disc is excellent value for money, being cheaper than many standard definition opera dvds.

B002C6K7N0|2.0|Dave can still come up with killer riffs, this album is once again an amazing guitar display...just like all Megadeth albums.   However, since The World Needs A Hero, Mustaine's vocals have become flat and boring, this continues that trend and is what holds this back from being classic and instead makes it just another Megadeth album.   Dave has...adimittedly...never been the best vocalist, but with some slight variance in delivery and even emotion in the vocal melody it used to work.  This is monotone, flat and fairly boring.  Almost amatuerish sounding in delivery, it doesnt sound like he spent much time on phrasing.   I felt UA was exactly the  same... the trend continues here.     Other reviews mention theres no swagger...no swing... no its not jazz...but this still fits exactly.  All the parts are here: musicianship, songwriting, production etc.   But somehow it just doesnt knock your socks off with that fifth cant-put-your-finger-on-it element.   My opinion is that no band that changes members like Dave has with Megadeth will ever gel.  There is a reason the Friedman albums are so good... continuity.   Dave has his latest crew on auto pilot.       Its his show, and I doubt he takes much advice from anyone, but Dave could benefit from some tips and coaching on how to keep the songs interesting vocally.  Theres no hook. Its a killer thrash fest from every other area, (though the solos seem to be too many notes just for the sake of too many notes....not so the friedman era...the solos had FEEL).  But overall some great songwriting.   The vocals ...to me....make it another forgettable album from Dave and his latest lineup.  The pre-hype (and many here) said its the best thing he's done since Rust In Peace... sorry...nope.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I enjoyed the new song \\"This Is It/I Never Heard\\"--both versions have something to offer.  The demo cuts are awesome! I especially liked \\"She's Out of My Life\\" with acoustic guitar--would have been interesting to see an MJ Unplugged Special! \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" had slightly different lyrics.  Liked hearing \\"Beat It\\" without the instrumental track...sounded like an a cappella group, except it was all MJ.    The pictures are nice, but some of the MJ pictures could have been bigger.  There was one with the stage lights ringed in purple which seemed like a waste of space.    My biggest complaint, other than we could have gotten more alternate or unreleased material, is the way the CDs were packaged.  If the record co. or whoever designed the packaging wanted to go with slots for the CDs, why not at least have a sealed bottom aka a pocket slot for the CD?  Otherwise, the CD could slip out of the bottom of the case.    That being said, I do sort of like the CD case shaped as a book.
0140185232|4.0|A wonderfully witty and thought provoking look at manners during the time between the two world wars.  Set mostly in France, this study of American expatriates revolves around Elliot, a socializing connector who views all non-French societies as barbaric, and Larry, a WWI fighter pilot who has looked death in the face and decided he wanted to live differently than most of the people he now meets.  Great questions arise during the story about our public image, possessions, happiness and why we are on this planet.  The book starts out slow but picks up once the characters start interacting.  There is a long section at the very end where the author, also a character in the story, retells a conversation he had with Larry about Larry's Hindu beliefs.  This section is expository, so can bog down, but the content is fairly interesting.
B002N14GP4|5.0|I heard people say this movie was a good one. \\"Scary\\" movies are not exactly my most favorite because they don't \\"scare\\". However, even though this one didn't scare either, I found a few times my heart beating pretty quickly. Awesome suspense and a great buy. Has to be one of the better movies of 2009. I didn't expect it to be this good of a movie, but Ester is sure a creepy one.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There have already been hundreds of coherent and thoughtful reviews on this album, so this review will probably be lost in the jumble. Still, I felt compelled to say something about this album since I just recently discovered it and wanted to explain why I really enjoy it.    First, let me start with the original release. In my case, the only \\"Let It Be\\" I had ever experienced before buying this CD was the released version in its 1980's and 2009 editions. Up until recently, my opinion of \\"Let It Be\\" was that Beatles fans should just take it for what it is...a slightly jumbled, unfinished collection of rehearsals/early takes. In my opinion, the original release has some great moments and catchy songs that I am convinced would have developed into beautiful Beatles classics had they been fully worked-out and realized during recording sessions. This isn't to say that I don't like the original Let It Be release. On the contrary, I like it very much; however to me, it has a chaotic/pieced together feel and at no point in listening to this CD do I think of it as a polished and complete Beatles album.    With all that said, I purchased \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" a little while ago to see how it sounded. I went into it being pretty skeptical and not expecting much. I was pretty upset with how Let It Be...Naked was being marketed: i.e. The way the Beatles wanted the album to sound, etc. At the time, I don't think the Beatles knew how they wanted it to sound so I doubt that this selling tactic is really true. With that said, after listing to Let It Be...Naked all the way through I was pleasantly surprised. My first impression was that this album now makes Let It Be sound like a fully realized album. I understand that this was sort of artificially created (with song selection, editing, mixing tracks, etc.), so for some this may be a contentious point. That being said, I really loved the takes and song selections on this album. I think the title does a decent job describing it.....basically it just feels like some crud has been scraped away for the album and on the whole it is more direct and to the point. As someone who likes the original Let It Be release, listening to this album was a wonderful treat which helped me rediscover and understand these songs in a new way.    For me, this is a necessary Beatles album to own, whether you are a fan of the original release or not. I would still recommend to any Beatles fan that they own both versions of this album, however I think that \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" presents some of the original material in a new light and it is a pleasure to listen to from front to back.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Casino is just as good as \\"Goodfellas\\", Scorsese's other wiseguy film that often overshadows Casino.  By just as good, I mean brilliant, perfect, and mesmerizing.  The movie is fast-paced, has a great soundtrack, with music pulsing throughout the film, has the best voice-over I've heard (it's integral to the story), the acting is perfect, and well, it's just one of those movies that does exactly what it tried to do.      Highly recommended as well is listening to commentary by Scorsese and some of the actors.  Scorsese's thoughts on the film are wonderfully enriching to the film viewing experience itself.  We find out that Scorsese is interested in the \\"conflict between the sacred and the profane\\" (no surprise there if you've seen other Scorsese films), so he shows this right away at the beginning of the film, by showing Lefty's blown-up body descending into a fiery hell, while the music playing is Bach's \\"The Passion of Christ\\".  Sacred and profane, all within the first minute.  Also, Scorsese says that he wanted the film to explore \\"the spiritual growth\\" of the gangsters who are \\"living in a sinner's paradise\\". Wow.  Not many directors can give you that in a film. Actress Sharon Stone talks of \\"the psychological density\\" of the characters, and actor Frank Vincent reminds us that the gangster \\"does not feel your pain\\".      Wonderfully entertaining.  The only caution I would give is that if you are offended by harsh language and violence, stay clear from this film. Otherwise, even though the film is close to three hours long, it's so engrossing, it seems to be a thrill ride that's over in too short a time.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|My kids and I loved the new diamond edition, I don't remember Snow white looking and sounding so good.
0385504225|1.0|I could barely finish this dull, boring book. It is just a watered down version of DaVinci Code, set in a new location.
B00008IAMD|4.0|This is an incredibly moving recording of the voice of a man looking back on his life.  His voice is gravelly and tremulous and sometimes makes you flinch ('Bridge Over Troubled Waters'), but his rendition of 'Hurt', 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face', 'We'll Meet Again' and other songs carries the wisdom & insight, pain & weariness of a life lived to the full over seventy + years.  The guitar and piano instrumentals play as smoothly as a well-maintained vintage engine and support the vocals without 'screaming look at me do this riff'.  This is not a CD for those who worship youth, beauty and a strong beat but it offers much to people who ponder the purpose of life and take stock of what they've done.  As the saying goes, old age ain't no place for cissies.
B002NACY2M|4.0|Fresh from his reunion with the Police and his album covering the hits of Elizabethan composer John Dowland, Sting now offers \\"If on a Winter's Night.\\" This is not some Christmas album with yet another cover of \\"Sleigh Ride\\" or \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" While there are some Christmas songs, these are not the usual Yuletide fare as Sting offers up an odd look at the relationship of Joseph and Mary in the \\"Cherry Tree Carol.\\" Long time Sting listeners will recognize new versions of \\"Gabriel's Message\\" and \\"The Hounds of Winter.\\" There are a number of traditional English songs here and Sting is accompanied by a company of excellent musicians. There are other influences as well. The charming \\"You Only Cross My Mind in Winter\\" is based on a piece by Bach while \\"Cold Song\\" is based on a poem by John Dryden. Needless to say, this is not an album for everyone. Some of the songs are as dark as a winter's night and Sting sounds mournful and melancholy (even by his standards). It's a wonderful concept and very few artists could pull it off. Critics of Sting will call it pretentious and there may be some truth to that. The bottom line remains that Sting is one of the most versatile rock/pop artists of the last few decades having taken on rock, world, jazz, classical, Spanish and Portuguese songs, and, now, traditional English folk songs. This is a fine album for a night by the fire with a glass of brandy or a mug of hot mulled cider but, again, it is not for everyone. Fans of Sting's Dowland album will probably like it but if you prefer his stints with the Police or even his more popular solo stuff, you may find \\"If on a Winter's Night\\" a bit too cold for your liking.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|This is a very well done movie, but there is one seen that was a bit much for me. You definitely want something really bad to happen to the \\"bad guys\\" in this. I do like that Wes Craven did the remake of his original film; you get the same vision for the film that way.........just done in a different time. Mentally prepare yourself for a few disturbing images when you watch the director's cut. Awesome ending though!
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I was somewhat disappointed.  Just a little bit of newness as far as content, the pictures are nice, demo's interesting, but hardly anything aside from the song (\\"This Is It\\") to represent the theme I would have thought was meant for this CD. I bought my copy from the MJ This Is It website, and it comes with a poster.  The cost was more, but I'm going to start watching very closely, what I purchase about MJ, from now on.  It seems \\"a-piece-of-the-action\\" is par for the course these days.<br />LUA,MJJ!
B00297FEUI|5.0|No over critical, super analyzed review of this soundtrack here.  With me, if I go to a movie and like the music, I buy the soundtrack.  And that's what I did with the score to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.  With scores like 'Forest Battle' 'I Rise, You Fall' and 'Prime', it's worth it.  Just like the first Transformers film score, Revenge of the Fallen is worth having in music collection.  The Transformer theme is now down in my most favorite themes of all time, as it should be.  It's great music from awesome films!
0385504225|5.0|First off. I won't give anything away in this review. What a great adventure. Fantastic book from cover to cover. The only problem: How can any Langdon adventure ever beat the Da Vinci Code. It simply can't just because it was such a fantastic blend of a brain roller coaster and thriller. The lost symbol is close but not quite there. Brain stimulating wise it offers almost as much - but how can you beat how we forever view \\"the last supper\\"... Ok to my review:  As a big fan of early American History and the great city of Washington DC it was a pleasure to read. Also loved the kudos to the ancient world and especially the ancient appreciation for the brain. (the only super computer of the time - makes sense why they had such a interest in the brain - and how we today may sometimes overlook it) The spiritual conclusion in the book is just out of this world and could and should spark a new \\"religion\\". (like we need one more) A very open, non denominational self empowering spiritual \\"following\\". Sign me up!!  Dan Brown I thank you. As \\"a creative\\" myself I know it must be frustrating for you to know how hard it will be to ever beat the Da Vinci Code's success. Keep trying - I will read everything you'll write. I would also like to read a book about your seemingly fantastic and open views on spirituality and higher powers, in a non thriller (non-fiction) format.      A related comment to the Langdon series: I wish the movies would have been better of both Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons . What Dan Brown gives us via his intellectual observations and insightful writing seemingly can't be translated to film. So far it's Dan Brown 2 Hollywood 0. Here's a challenge to European/international film makers: Please try to cut a deal with whomever holds the movie rights and give it a go. Italian, Swedish, British, French, Czech... Perhaps the less commercial and more serious style of foreign films would suite the subject matters and the intellectual content better. This way a larger audience would be introduced properly to Dan Brown's magnificent work. (I am sure that the last two films have disappointed both book fans and potential Dan Brown readers) I am not holding my breath for the Lost Symbol movie...but I will probably go and see it, just for the \\"cheap\\" cinematic visit to Washington DC.
0307269981|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is such a fun protagonist - kind of a cross between Artemis Fowl, Dirty Harry, Sydney Bristow, and Daniel Tammet. Stieg Larsson is clearly fond of his character \\"Kalle\\" Blomkvist (perhaps based on himself?), and indeed it is difficult not to grow attached to many of the \\"good guy\\" characters in the novel.<br /><br />If you like suspense, drama, and action, you'll likely enjoy this book. You'll get caught up in the worlds of journalists, cops, security people, and bad guys as you try to sort out the information they have and solve the mystery/ies.<br /><br />My only complaint - and it's a light one - is that I feel two items require too much suspension of disbelief. One involves Salander's untrained mathematical achievements, and the other occurs during the final few chapters of the book. Nonetheless, I give this book five stars for plot, characters, pacing, and writing. I loved it.

0739384171|5.0|I enjoyed this second book in the trilogy and can't wait for the last one to be released. The lyrical quality of the prose makes it difficult to believe it's a translation from Swedish. The content is sometimes graphic (especially in the first book, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) but the story is very compelling and the characters are well-written.

B002MW50KO|5.0|I never imagined I could listen to the old Christmas songs with \\"new ears\\" again, but Dylan has made it possible. I enjoy \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" more each time I hear it. Who'd have thought!    Years ago I saw Mabel Mercer when her singing voice had completely gone - she literally couldn't carry a tune (apparently it came back some, later), and her brilliant vocals are still seared in my memory. Many reviewers seem to feel their job is to judge Dylan's voice - that is, the voice of a singer who has spent forty-five years trying to convince people that each of us has the right to sound the way we sound. The question is not, \\"What's wrong with his voice?\\" The question is, \\"What does he do with it?\\" For my money, it's extraordinarily expressive. The \\"beauty\\" question seems to me to be entirely beside the point.     I can't imagine anyone quarreling with the way Dylan sings \\"The Christmas Blues,\\" which is the perfect match of song and material. But I equally love the way he puts his stamp on traditional material. As I said, it's as though I'm hearing familiar songs for the first time.    Two other points I haven't seen covered in these reviews: the backup singers have been compared to cheesy vocal groups of the fifties, but that's exactly what Dylan didn't do - instead, he used a very tight vocal group, few in number. If you listen to the backup group itself, it's quite remarkable.     And finally, I have yet to see anyone mention this - the spicy picture of Bettie Page on the jacket - she became a born-again Christian!
B00012QM8G|5.0|SPOILER ALERT - Don't read this if you don't want any spoilers!    This movie starts with a member of the SS party named Oskar Shindler. He has one purpose in life and that is to live richly. He takes advantage of the Jews lot in life under German rule to open a manufacturing facility.     This movie leaves nothing to the imagination and I suspect that is the way director Steven Spielberg wanted it. You see the coldness of it all. A man, and worker for Shindler, is shot in the head for having one arm. Shindler thinks of this more as a business man one worker lost and therefore one more to hire and train. It isn't until his workers are all driven to concentration camps that the reality of what is happening to the Jews really strikes Oskar.     The SS in this movie appear to have no heart. They don't view Jews as humans but rather as rodents. They think nothing of killing them, even the children. In the camps the Jews are humiliated by beatings and forced public nudity. They are shot \\"arbitrarily\\" as Oskar puts it. Such awful scenes led \\"some Jews to complain to God in anguish\\" (Fisher 275). Many Jews continued to hope for better times just as occured for the biblical Job. God allowed Satan to take everything from him, but he was rewarded for his suffering when God replaced everything. Their enduring hope was shown in the Jewish prayer recited in the beginning and end of the movie.     Throughout the movie Shindler moves to protect \\"his\\" Jews by listing them as \\"necessary workers\\". He tries through reasoning and cunning to save as many lives as possible even putting himself in harms way to do so. In the end Shindler saves 1000 Jews by enlisting them as workers. He allows and encourages them to engage in thier religious celebrations including allowing them to leave their jobs early on Friday to prepare for Passover. Passover is the Jewish Sabbath taking place \\"from sunset Friday night to sunset Saturday night, because the Jewish \\"day\\" begins with nightfall\\" (Fisher 277).  Oskar's actions toward the end of this film show that some SS members did have a heart and that not all hopeful Jews would be let down.     Works Cited:    Fisher, Mary Pat.

B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I'm another huge fan of the late MJ, probably since I could walk. I hate to have to say that this is just another greatest hits cd. I wish they would have maybe waited and put a few unreleased songs on it that we haven't heard that are in his vault of songs. There are a few \\"Demo\\" versions of past hits like Beat It, Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\\" and 2 others but honestly, they are not that big of a deal. The new song \\"This Is It\\" really isn't even that great and feel that this was the push to make the cd sell because it was a new song. The packaging of the discs is ok but found out that the built in sleeves that the discs slide into have NO bottom and they fall out...duh!<br /><br />Unless your a huge fan and need to have everything then pass on this until there is new unreleased material. I feel that this was all rushed out to make more money off MJ and the worst part is its all music we have already! This is just my opinion, I am a loyal fan of MJ but with everything that happened I feel that it would have been more respectful and exciting to wait and put out new music.

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I bought this book as it's one of the few \\"mainstream\\" thrillers currently available on Kindle to Australian customers (sigh). I was pleasantly surprised. My Kindle has had one hell of a workout with this book that I simply could not put down. This would have to be one of the best thrillers I've read in many year. Larsson develops his characters slowly but deeply throughout the novel in a way I believe European authors do so much better than most. I particularly enjoyed the way the key characters were built up separately in the early stages of the story only to come together in such an amazing way mid way through. There was enough complexity in the Vander family to keep me guessing and reguessing at each turn and the final reveal was stunning. I loved how the book then proceeded further to nail the dirty corporate that landed the hero in jail in the first place.<br /><br />I'm heading back now to buy the other two books in the trilogy while my Kindle recharges! Such a shame that Larssen isn't around to keep this kind of writing going.

B0006J28BO|3.0|The Cat Returns is a film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hiroyuki Morita.  When The Cat Returns was released on DVD in the United States, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contains the film and some special features.<br /><br />The first bonus feature on the disc is a roughly nine minute long documentary titled, \\"Behind the Microphone.\\"  During the documentary, you see some of the voice actors recording the English dialogue for the dub version of the film.  There are also interviews with some of the English dub actors (Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, Elliott Gould, Andy Richter, and Tim Curry).  It's a decent documentary for what it is.<br /><br />Next is a thirty-four minute feature titled, \\"The Making of The Cat Returns.\\"  This was originally produced for a Japanese audience.  However, instead of putting English subtitles onto the piece, English voices are dubbed over the entire production.  Over the course of the piece, you learn about how The Cat Returns came to be, there are interviews with the director and some of the crew, and you learn about the voice acting and the music for the film.  Personally, I think this feature would have been stronger if the Japanese audio had not been dubbed over and having English subtitles on the feature instead.<br /><br />The next feature on the disc are the Japanese trailers and television spots for The Cat Returns.  There is Japanese audio, but no English subtitles.  This extra runs for four and a half minutes, and includes six promotional spots.  The spots are in one continuous piece; there is no way to select which ones you want to see.  The final menu option in the special features menu allows you to register the DVD.<br /><br />All that is on the second disc of The Cat Returns is a storyboard version of the film; basically, it's the movie, expect it only utilizes storyboards and none of the actual animation.  To be honest, I don't understand the point or the appeal of seeing the complete film with storyboards instead of animation.  I think the DVD release would have been stronger if it had just been one disc, and had only had perhaps some brief storyboard-to-animation comparisons for some of the scenes.  I think that putting in the second DVD is a waste.<br /><br />The animation and storytelling in The Cat Returns makes the film a very enjoyable viewing experience.  While this film shares some similar ideas with Catnapped!, I felt that The Cat Returns was the stronger of the two films.  The writing and storytelling were much stronger in The Cat Returns, and the concepts were executed much better in this film.  The Cat Returns is also a good film for a family viewing experience.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli's films, then you should see The Cat Returns.  Even with the unnecessary second disc, and the few minor complaints about the bonus features on disc one, this is a DVD that should be in the collection of any anime fan.e film with storyboards instead of animation.

B001P50HOI|4.0|A YES concert speaks for itself and this CD perfectly captures their 2001 tour.  My own personal reasons for always remembering the show I saw at Jones Beach on Long Island, New York is because the show was on Friday September 7, 2001.  Four days later, we were attacked on 9-11.
0470477237|4.0|At first thought I would give this a 3 out of 5 stars.  However it is so comprehensive with regards to social media and the impact it is and will have on commerce and marketing I am giving it a 4 out of 5 stars.      At times I found the author to be right on the mark and quite insightful and at other times I found myself thinking that the incredibly insightful person who wrote the book had been  kidnapped, forced to drink the \\"social media Kool-Aid\\" and live with Care Bears for 45 days, thus morphing his sense of society.    Having said that, this is absolutely well worth the read. But if you find yourself from time to time thinking \\"where is this guy coming from?\\" ignore your apprehension and just read on to the next section, he will come back to reality and it will get good again.

I read nonfiction, historically based fiction, work with people from the USC Testimony to Tolerance, and more.    I anxiously awaited this movie for MONTHS and was not let down at all when I got to watch it on opening night.  I will be buying and showing clips of this after my Holocaust study this year.  As far as historically accurate, it is of course is a wonderful fantasy portrayal by Tarantino.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BIG fan of his, but I am now.  As far as my literature studies goes - I will be able to use this movie to guide students into fantasy creative writing.  I will have them take an important event in history and REWRITE it as their fantasy creation.    *********OH YES, THE BEST PART, THE NIGHT OF THE MOVIE?

0385504225|5.0|Anything and everything you might want to know about the Masonic Lodge. Fast-paced thriller but I took my time to get all the historical facts and nuances.
B001E57SH8|2.0|Very disappointed. Not the usual Zippo quality. The first time I filled the lighter it ran out of butane within 5 days even though the usage was nominal.  Difficult to handle with one hand while trying to light it.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I've been waiting for this release since the day I found out it was coming. Now that it's here I'm so relieved to hear it and NOT be disappointed as I am with so many other anticipated Prog releases. This one delivers man! The arrangements are incredible and the harmonies are even better than the two previous releases. Hearing Roine's voice before Neil's in the opening track was a pleasant surprise and the rest of the disk just keeps getting better which each listen.       The bonus CD is also nicely done one of the better \\"Disk Two\\" I've heard in quite a while. All musicians as you might expect get to demonstrate their talent and this album in particular seems to play more like a true recording as a band verses separate arrangements being electronically sent to each other.   I think this is the bands best yet and I hope not the last, hey so I'm greedy, what do you want from me? The art work too is stunning and demonstrates how it would be such a loss is downloading music replaced buying something physical.       Guys, (Chic's don't dig Prog) if you like the first two CD's then I think you'll really enjoy this one.     Steve
0882709194|5.0|Wow, after looking at all of those negative reviews, it seems that many \\"doest protest too much!\\" People are so angry over this, as if they are unwilling to even think critically when it comes to their own religious beliefs (i.e., evolution), which is exactly what Ray Comfort gets at in this book, he DOES a thorough review of the evidence (or more accurately, the lack thereof) that evolutionists promulgate. He goes through it piece by piece and allows you to decide for yourself. Are you simply believing what the propaganda machine/the media and your college teachers say about evolution, have you really considered the evidence. Folks in the evolutionary camp like to treat \\"creation scientists\\" as if they are not real scientists at all, when most of them have graduated from stellar universities like Yale and Harvard, these aren't \\"stupid\\" or \\"ignorant\\" people. The only ignorance is intolerance and being unwilling to critically evaluate what you believe and why you believe it. At least creation scientists are open to debates and discussion of the any evidence that is unearthed, whereas (you might see for yourself from some of the reviews) that often evolutionists don't want any opposition or debate. Maybe they secretly know they stand on sinking sand? I think everyone who believes in the theory of evolution (emphasis on the word theory) should give this book a look, what do you have to lose? You might even get saved!
0143038583|4.0|Omnivore's Dilemma equips an eater who can eat just about everything with the knowledge to better pick and choose.  To get us eaters from here to there, Omnivore's Dilemma takes what I found to be a unique approach:  it focuses not so much on our food per se but instead focuses on the four production and distribution systems that grow our food.  Investigating the practices and effects of each system, Pollan, the author, writes mostly from first hand experience, recounting for the reader his journey from the pasture or corn field to the feed lot and grocery store.  At times, his vivid prose paints what can be a sensationalized image (although the documentary [[ASIN:B0027BOL4G Food, Inc.]], in tracing many of Pollan's steps, suggests he is less sensationalistic than one may first believe).  At others, Pollan's curiousity can get the better of him, causing him to wander in an academic ether with no clear way back to the book's main message (such as the chapter on the ethics of eating animals).  Even with these shortcomings, though, the information Pollan conveys is so compelling you readily excuse his indulgences.  Leaving you appreciating the book for telling you what is behind the labels on the food we buy as compared to what the marketing department is saying.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|Good portrayal of Beethoven's tempestuous character and very effective excerpts of some of his works of that period on the sound track, especially the 9th symphony.  Somewhat too sugary regarding talk of God and attaining heaven. Very good depiction of his deafness and attempts to \\"hear\\" the music. Also very effective presentation   of the ending of the 9th and his discovering the audience's reaction - too many liberties with the copyist's conducting, but it's forgivable.
B002NXSRW0|1.0|If you know anything about GI Joe and like it as a child, don't watch this movie.  You will probably be as ticked off as I was.  Directors and writers ruin so much these days.  If I could rate it lower than what I did, I would have.  The guy playing Duke shouldn't be in any movie.  He's horrible.
B00005221M|3.0|The Bottom Line:    This version of Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans looks great (it was directed by Michael Mann after all) but the central romance never really clicks and, despite being a great actor, Day-Lewis can't breathe much life into lead character Hawkeye at all; say what you will about middlebrow epics like Braveheart and Gladiator, but they at least succeed in getting the audience invested in the leads, something this movie is unable to do.    2.5/4
B002JTHFUS|5.0|This is a great collection, and the sound quality is excellent on both CDs and the DVD. The one minor complaint is with the DVD... the documentary is the same one that is found on the U2 Go Home...Live From Slane Castle DVD, but the live performances still make it an excellent DVD and well worth the extra price.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|The poem alone has cause a 3rd purchase (No rips). Something is wrong or off here, Michael was going to base his comeback, perhasp final bow and repair his fortunes on a production that would showcase a song that was co-written by a well known song writer and not contact him about using it or give him proper credit?  He was just going perform would have been 50 sold out and highly publicized concerts and hoped the co-writer wouldn't find out about the music???  MJ of course believed that he wouldn't immediately be sued over this mega hit, wouldn't ruin the long waited/requested concerts or that the media wouldn't go for blood??? (Yeah-Right!!!)  Put away the emotion be it like or dislike for MJ and think this through using the information we have been given. This is truly not an attack on Paul Anka or Sony, but something is off, something is missing from this story and I only have the word of those who are still here to tell it.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|i will not spend too many words on this.    this album is nothing the band hasn't done before, but much lower energy, to repetitious from song to song. should have stopped on the Uprising single!!!
B00164KYV4|3.0|The Bottom Line:    This ensemble romantic piece is never very funny or moving and there are a million movies out there which can generate more laughs or tears, but at the same time I couldn't bring myself to hate it; sure it has no real ambition towards being a good film and waslittle more than a mercenary attempt to get couples into theaters around Valentine's Day, but it's watchable and never mean-spirited, so if you want something stupid to watch with your date you could do worse.      2.5/4
0345479092|3.0|I love her method. This is actually a good book.    However, anyone who REALLY needs this book probably won't have enough time to really read this whole book in a decent amount of time.    It's long, drawn out, and isn't easy to navigate. It takes forever to get to the point... but it has good points.    The No Cry Sleep Solution is much better for those who don't have many peaceful hours to finish reading this one.    But, if you were to read this book BEFORE there was a problem, it would be really great.

B00005QW4K|5.0|In this third (and probably final) installment of the Evil Dead series, not only do we see a drastic change in scenery (Medieval England instead of American woods), we also see much less graphic content. You don't have internal organs bursting out of human bodies, but living skeletons on fire and breaking apart. There is only a minimal amount of gore, and the black and slapstick humor takes over. But is that necessarily a bad thing? Of course, not. Even though the film has an overall different style, it still has that same sort of wicked charm that the first two film brought out. Plus, you still have Bruce Campbell as the main character, so it's bound to be bad@** throughout. Again, this isn't as violent and daring as the first two Evil Dead films, but it's still very entertaining to watch. I'd give this an A-.
B0000714BP|5.0|The first two times I saw this movie, I saw only bits and pieces of it, different bits and pieces each time. Even in chunks, I liked it. Once I saw the full film, I fell in love. Patrick Swayze pulls off his role with stunning ease, making you forget that there is really a man under the make up, women's clothes, and wig. Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo tackle their roles with the same enthusiasm and manage to be equally as charming and convincing.<br /><br />The movie tackles domestic violence in an understated fashion, showing a woman who is cowed and bullied but eventually, with the help of three \\"women\\" who have a courage she lacks, finds that courage and stands up to the coward that abuses her.<br /><br />There's a little bit of romance, a little bit of action, more than a little drama. There is, quite literally, something for everyone in this movie. It's great for a lot of laughs, a couple of tears, and just a really great movie night at home.<br /><br />Even my 8 & 6 yr old sons enjoy this movie!
B00275EHCI|2.0|Surrogates is a movie with a really interesting premise and a really nice cast and the most uninspired, lackluster, rehashed story I've seen in a science fiction film lately. Luckily, it has a really interesting premise!    The story sets us in a near future world where no one leaves their house, instead opting to hook their brain up to a machine that allows them to telepathically connect to a synthetic body that goes out into the world. This saves everybody the hassles of catching diseases, having to use energy, getting maimed or killed, etc. Also, of course, the synthetic body does not look like its operater, instead being either a beautiful representation of themselves, or a completely different person or gender altogether. A person's bodily image becomes precisely what they desire.    Naturally, something so idyllic yet strange has detractors, and the plot follows Bruce Willis as a detective as he attempts to track down a weapon that is capable of frying the synthetic surrogates in a way that traces back the line and at the same time kills the operators.    So we have a seemingly utopian society with obvious flaws under threat and a man who is not sure what side he is on really unravelling the mystery up to an unexcitedly predictable ending.    I guess I wasn't paying attention well enough since going into this I thought it was a scifi action film. I misunderstood something since there are no real action sequences, although there are a couple of chases that are more plotpoints than action sequences. So action does not come in and pick Surrogates up by its bootstraps to become a better film.    In the end, it was pretty boring. It was fascinating to watch the actors pretend to be synthetic bodies, often not moving entirely naturally and little things like that. And the idea itself, while treading very close to The Matrix and others of that ilk, does lend itself to a lot of imaginative possibilities, many of which are actually touched upon in the film.    If you dig scifi, and think the premise is cool go ahead and watch it. You won't find any reason to watch it ever again, but you won't regret having seen it the one time either.
1401323820|4.0|The book is short, only 130 pages. It's a great 1-2 day read. Fast paced writing and good action scenes. This isn't pulitzer prize winning writing, but I didn't expect that. Its exactly what I expected- fast read, entertaining and well done. I love how ABC has worked this in with the tv show. I watch the show also, and I could see the show characters in the book, and that was ok with me. That may bother some people.
1594488878|4.0|Heeee's back -- the Nick Hornby of High Fidelity, of About a Boy.  Once again he gives his views on art, using music as his vehicle.  Once again his characters stand up on the page and argue right in front of you.  Tucker Crowe is a musician who brings in mind Dylan, Springsteen, and Leonard Cohen (how hilarious that combination would be in real life) who walked away from his career at his peak, and in the 20 years preceding the opening of this story has acquired a Salinger-like mystique.  The reasons for this, how he passed those 20 years, what has become of him is all explained in this book, but are not the driving point of the narrative.  An English couple make up the other two central characters, and the effect the past has on them and why in some cases it is difficult to move on.  Highly recommended.

B002JTHFUS|5.0|I've never been very happy with U2's 1980s work on CD.  The mastering was not done well for the format and it really took some life out of it.  Now that has mostly been corrected (Rattle and Hum is the lone 80s album yet to be remastered).      This box set is fantastic, in the tradition of The Joshua Tree box set from 2007.  You get a beautiful book with pictures and comments from Eno, Lanois, and others reminiscing.  The lyrics are there as well, something excluded for the CD release.  Also some nice black and white photographs on textured parchment that are frame worthy.      The first disc is the album, sounding better than ever.  Adam's bass is more pronounced here and the dynamic range of the CD is finally put to good use, giving as a better feel for each song.  Very well done.  There's stuff in there that I had not heard before, only ever hearing the old CD version.    The second disc is full of extras.  Only a few songs had not been released in the past.  Most of it is remastered stuff that appeared as b-sides for the singles or on the Wide Awake In America EP, making that EP obsolete.  Disappearing Act is a great song, featuring recently added vocals by Bono, much like Wave Of Sorrow on Joshua Tree.  Yoshino Blossom is a good instrumental that had not been officially released.  Then there are two remixes of Wire and an excellent Sort of Homecoming remix done by Daniel Lanois as he was working with Peter Gabriel on So.  And because of that you can hear Gabriel on this quite excellent version of the song.    Everything else on this disc was released before but it sounds better than ever, just like the album itself.  It also compiles all the releases that occurred surrounding The Unforgettable Fire into one set.    Now onto the DVD.  It features music videos from this album.  Two for Pride and \\"live\\" videos for Bad and A Sort Of Homecoming as they were released to MTV.  We also get The Unforgettable Fire documentary - so it is basically the old Unforgettable Fire Collection that was released on video cassette back in the 80s (and it is called that on the box set).  So that's the first time it has been released on DVD.    The second bit on the DVD is live material.  A couple of songs from the 1986 Conspiracy of Hope Tour and U2's Live Aid performance.  The second Pride music video (Sepia version) is found here as is a bootleg video of 11 O'Clock Tick Tock.  I'm not sure why the bootleg is on there as the quality is not all that good.    Overall the set is great.  The one complaint could be that they didn't include the concert from Dortmund that was recorded for this tour, but I can also understand why it was not included.  Much of that music was covered in the restored DVD release of Under A Blood Red Sky that featured the full concert outside of Fire as that footage was unusable.  However, it would have been nice to have a live version of The Unforgettable Fire, a live version of Wire, and a live version of A Sort of Homecoming.  Indian Summer Sky was only played a few times and it didn't come off well.  Promenade, 4th of July, and Elvis Presley and America were never played.  So ultimately the only critique I'd levy would be the lack of performances for those three songs (the performance video for Sort of Homecoming wasn't a real performance video nor was that concert performance a real concert performance - it was a soundcheck recording with audience reaction thrown in).      I'd guess that U2 either doesn't have the rights to the Dortmund show, they don't like it, or they're saving it for a release at some later date (a boxed set of U2 live shows on DVD would be nice).      But that is really a minor complaint.  This great album sounds better than ever.  The DVD gives you some good stuff and the extras CD is full of goodies, old and new.    A must buy for any fan.
B0000CDLC8|4.0|Content-wise, this double-disc DVD-Audio set is pretty much the same as the 3CD set, but it is mixed for 5.1 surround sound that can be played back in a DVD-Audio player or a DVD-Video player in Dolby Digital.<br /><br />The album is a collection of songs performed live at venues in Southern California between the band's landmark \\"fourth\\" album and their creatively stellar 'Houses of the Holy' record, circa 1975. This DVD-Audio disc captures a time in history when live audiences came to hear performers play and would sit through and enjoy 25-minute versions of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and 19-minute \\"Moby Dick\\" drum solos. Today, audiences more often than not have to be mesmerized by pyrotechnics, lasers and video screens rather than by virtuoso performances.<br /><br />One of these performances of note is on one of the band's signature songs \\"Heartbreaker,\\" featuring the guitar handiwork of Jimmy Page, which on How The West Was Won includes a long, stream-of-consciousness solo. The tune starts off meandering through a few verses until it gets to the solo. This is when the 5.1 mix takes a very tasty \\"Heartbreaker\\" solo to new levels, considering that the crowd interaction with the solo makes the listening experience richer. About 30 seconds into a hoedown portion of the solo, the crowd starts to clap along. When listening to the DVD-Audio mix, you want to follow along. You feel like there are other fans directly behind you, yet the performance is still in front of you. Ultimately, Page breaks the solo down into a little sloppy classical guitar work and you get a chance to hear some of the more subtle additions that the DVD-Audio format makes to the recording.<br /><br />Another example of little details sounding better on DVD-Audio is on \\"Going To California,\\" where you can hear the mandolin better than on the CD. It sounds more rich and textured on DVD-Audio and in surround sound.<br /><br />The surround mix doesn't put too much besides crowd noise and acoustic ambience in the rear speakers, but there are times when it seems like the engineer is pushing to make more of the recording than is there in terms of an adventurous surround mix. A good example of this is on Robert Plant's vocal on \\"The Immigrant Song,\\" which is mixed in such a way that seems a little too loud for the rear speakers for a few brief moments.<br /><br />With surround sound now in the mix and backwards compatibility to all DVD players, all Led Zeppelin fans should have 'How The West Was Won' on DVD-Audio. The most important reason is the historical importance of the performance, paired with the excellence in musicianship captured in the master. But buyer beware -- this DVD-Audio makes listening to Led Zeppelin more fun live, but it is not a reference caliber DVD-Audio surround sound disc. We have yet to delve into the master tapes of the classic Zeppelin records and attempt to remix them for discrete surround. Some say that because of the four-track recording techniques used on the early albums, the project may be close to impossible. Others suggest that it can be done and point to the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' as an example of an older recording taking on wonderful audio quality in DVD-Audio and surround sound. Nevertheless, 'How The West Was Won' is better and more exciting on DVD-Audio than on CD. -- Jerry Del Colliano, 10/2003there are times when it seems like the engineer is pushing to make more of the recording than is there in terms of an adventurous surround mix.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I loved the two previous books and couldn't wait for this one.  I was sorely disappointed.  It is clear that Brown did his research, but he also gets carried away sometimes.  While in the airplane, the main character hears the XYZ engines slow down.  Like he would know, or care, the name of the manufacturer of the plane's engine.  Minor issue but distracting nonetheless.    The book is full of action and is very suspenseful in true Dan Brown fashion.  However, I figured out the identity of the book's villain fairly rapidly.  It was predictable and a common thread in many fictional stories.    He did his usually excellent job of painting a picture for us with words.  I could easily visualize all the buildings and locations he described.  Unfortunately, this was all tossed out the window when the big national security issue threat is revealed.  Had I not been reading this on my Kindle, I would've tossed it in frustration.  It was, frankly,  stupid.  A man this creative couldn't come up with something better?    In my opinion this is a book you can totally skip.  Or at least check it out from the library so you don't want any money on it.
1592402038|5.0|[[ASIN:1592402038 Eats, Shoots  &  Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation]]    I bought this book as I am undergoing a course in proof reading. Lynn Truss gives an entertaining point of view of the proper use of punctuation. Her presentation should serve very well for anyone to remember the salient points of this art which is vanishing little by little.
0385504225|2.0|I really pity Dan Brown his success. Having achieved a thrilling formula in The Davinci Code, he seems intent on reusing it here with little effect. I loved The Davinci Code, for all its flaws. It was fun. This book is not fun. I hate the villain, not in the good way either. He bores me. I am tired of the damsel and the professor routine. The dialog is thin. The Langdon character seems dumbed down, caricatured. The surprises are not surprises, the riddles are too formulaic. All in all, it flopped.    I am sorry Dan. I don't mean to criticize. It is just that I waited so long to be taken on this ride, and paid my money for it, and here I am trudging my way through this lesser work. I can only imagine the pressure put on you to write the next great novel. It didn't happen this time. I get this vague feeling you weren't ready to write this book, that this book was not from your soul the way your last was. This feels like your publisher made you do it, or maybe this was written to be the next movie. It simply wasn't written from inspiration, or that is the way it seems.    That all said, I think Dan will be back, and bring us something more worthy next time. I will buy your book, and forget this one, and hope that the next ride is thriller. Keep at it Dan.
006123205X|5.0|It is like someone is watching over your shoulder and reading your very thoughts.  I realized that I must not be the only one thinking and reacting the same way.  I was not aware of the consequences of my actions and now see how it is not all that difficult to adjust how I present things and more specifically my expectations of the opposite sex. My husband and I listened to this on cassette years ago and have had great discussions with great results.  I purchased the CD for my adult son as he ventures off into relationships with women. I would recommend this as a tool for all young adults.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am completely spoiled to this 20 minute business! I used to work out 45-55 minutes with Billy Blanks Monday-Friday. While I saw definite endurance and muscle tone progress I was not seeing much weight loss. I randomly found this on Amazon one day and thought it would be a great change of pace. I had tried Denise Austin and was scared that Jillian might be as completely annoying- SHE IS NOT! I was thrilled with the first try out of the video (I started at level 2). I alternated between 1 and 2 for a little while before even thinking about 3. 3 stills kicks my butt to the point I feel like I cannot keep up my form as well as I should through the entire exercise. I have lost 10lbs., have muscle tone that I would have envied at the age of 20, and am completely sold on Jillian! I will never waste my time with a 45 minute workout again! 20 minutes with these results? AWESOME!!!!
0316017922|5.0|Most people perceive \\"Outliers\\" as a book that highlights a logic behind success that has more to do with a legacy and opportunity than a high IQ.   Let's rephrase this a bit. \\"Outliers\\" are observations of the writer in relation to why some people are able to score financial success while others, with apparently higher intelligence, must bite the dust. The book is about Financial success.    The underlying force that makes a financial success is the need of every human being for a system of support and guidance. The success stories show a silent sustenance of an intelligence, usually older person(s) totally supporting the endeavors of the one that becomes the financial success the book speaks of.     It does make wonder whether humans are puppets on a string played against each other in the arena of Earth by some subconscious force basically our own; the average person has very little knowledge of, how it works, how it fits together with the conscious, and part of the collective mindset. Emotional intelligence has more to do with it than a High IQ. Would \\"Bill Gates = Microsoft\\" be an entity without his parents and friends?    One such remarkable observation is a passage on page 142 - 9.:  \\"Jewish immigrants like the Floms and the Borgenichts and the Janklows were not like the other immigrants who came to America in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Irish and the Italians were peasants, tenant farmers from the impoverished countryside of Europe. Not So with the Jews. For centuries in Europe, Jews had been forbidden to own land, so they had clustered in cities and towns, taking up urban trades and professions.  70% of the Eastern European Jews who came through Ellis Island in the 1930s or before WWI had some kind of occupational skill.\\"  A fact of American History often ignored.       Whether birth-dates are crucial to become a hockey star is debatable...this has more to do with the cut-off dates imposed by the organizers and where each person's individual birth date is in relation of these cut-off dates.     The same is applicable in the field of education: to enter a class where automatically, as a result of your birth date, you are the oldest of the class, enjoying the opportunities of your maturity that makes learning an easy ride versus  a person with a birth date that makes him/her the youngest of the class and a possibility of showing problems with both maturity and comprehension.     As the saying goes: \\"Your environment can make or break you\\". The book shows the importance of the environment in which one is born, a support system that comes in many shapes and forms, to facilitate automatically failure or success. \\"Outliers\\" is a great read for any parent or educator with adequate documentation.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This series is intense, thrilling and violent. I would think twice before letting younger teens watch it. But the rest of us can thoroughly enjoy the machinations of Gemma, Clay, and Jax.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|Before I get started, let me say that I hope this movie catapults the idea into the public that - with the right idea, creativity, and people who can help fulfill a vision - a small budget can go a long way. As a matter of fact, there is nothing in this movie that can't be achieved for free (outside of the theatrical ending, but the alternate ending that's floating around online is completely achievable for free), sans the cost of the camera. A group of friends who are aspiring actors could do this. I don't mean to over-simplify it, because there is a lot involved with something like this, and I know a LOT of people try things like this with no success, but, in theory, this movie could motivate a lot of people to possibly cook up some great, entertaining stuff on a low budget! And for those of you who think, \\"Blair Witch Project,\\" the only thing this movie has in common is the camera perspectives and suspense.<br /><br />Something else I keep seeing is people saying there are no special effects. Well, there are. As a matter of fact, it's full of special effects. What makes that great, however, is the very fact that the special effects were so subtle and fluid that they didn't ring through as special effects at all. When I say special effects, I don't mean 3D craziness or someone looking like their arm is coming out of their butt. What I mean is doors opening/closing, things moving, fire happening out of nowhere, etc.. There's one big one in particular I don't want to detail, because I don't want to provide anymore spoilers than already provided in the reviews here. Long story short, you see things happen on the screen that couldn't happen without the use of some kind of prop. For those of you who have seen the movie, I'm specifically referring to the night before the final night. What'd they use to make that happen? Pretty good effect, even if it was something deviously simple. =)<br /><br />Now, where the movie is concerned, I'm not quite sure why some people are walking into this thing expecting the world. I mean, yeah, there's the hype behind it and people saying this is the scariest movie ever and yadda, yadda, yadda, but at the end of the day, it's a low budget film with a amature feel that ends up going away about 20-20 minutes in the movie. If it's below you to go watch a movie and just allow yourself to get into it, then this isn't the movie for you. No, it's not the scariest movie in history (anyone who says that has either forgotten some truly terrifying movies in the past and they need a refresher, or they just haven't seen the right scary movie yet), nor is it filled with A-list celebrity acting.<br /><br />Once I got past the expectations I had from all the hype (which stuck with me for all of maybe 5-10 minutes into the movie), I sat back and enjoyed the ride. The techniques used to scare you are simple methods with a level of realism that truly appeals to your imagination. This isn't the Jeepers Creepers type of creepy where you leave the theater thinking this thing is going to steal you out of the night and eat your eyeballs out of your head or whatever. It's the type of creepy where you hear something go bump in the night, but instead of thinking it could be someone in the house, your imagination starts running wild! Now, if you can't relate to that, then this isn't going to be an enjoyable movie for you. Movies are birthed out of imagination and the way I see it, there's nothing wrong with - as the viewer - allowing your imagination to go wherever it needs to for any given movie to do what it's there to do. It's creepy, suspenseful, and you'll be delighted to know that there isn't an M. Night Shyamalan type of ending waiting for you, so go and be thoroughly creeped out!<br /><br />Bottom line, do you want to see it? Then go see it. If not, then don't. Don't go see it expecting the greatest movie ever made. Don't NOT go see it just because there are however many negative criticisms you read. I was skeptical asto how good this would be, but I really just gave in to allowing my imagination to go where the movie wanted it to go and it made it so incredibly creepy that I can't tell you the last time I was this creeped out. Ironically, it was probably the original Poltergeist that had me this creeped out! I say ironic, because it's in a similar vein and Steven Spielberg (who wrote Poltergeist) is the one who made this movie hit the big screen en masse ala that which comes out of hollywood. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />-StephenI really just gave in to allowing my imagination to go where the movie wanted it to go and it made it so incredibly creepy that I can't tell you the last time I was this creeped out.

B001GCUO16|5.0|I usually don't base my opinion of a movie on what's its based on as a story or compare it to other movies in its series, i just take the movie as a stand-alone feature. and this one is an Excellent action movie from the fight sequences to the visual effects involved.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E: 8 out of 10: I was never a big fan of the Short Circuit movies. It was not just the thespian outings of Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg I had issues with; I also hated the freakin robot. In addition, while I have admired some Pixar releases in the past (The Incredibles in particular), I am hardly the biggest fan of the studio and often admire some of their competition (such as DreamWorks Shrek) more.    Therefore, I did not go into Wall-E with very high hopes. Had I known it featured the music of Hello Dolly I may never have seen it at all. After the first twenty minutes, I was blown away.    I will let other reviewers explain the Chaplin style magic of the piece. Suffice it to say wow. When the movie settles into somewhat of a plot it does bog down slightly (There are at least one to many scenes of robots we do not care about chasing other robots we do not care about) but in reality it is simply a different magic.    Emotionally satisfying and wonderfully subversive Wall-E is necessary viewing for adults. I am not sure if it necessarily a good film for young people with poor attention spans, but thoughtful kids will get much out of it.    Moreover, kudos to Pixar for making one of the most individualistic anti-commercial films I have ever seen.
0446615625|5.0|Synopsis    It exists at the fringes of Washington, D.C., has no power, and consists solely of four eccentric and downtrodden members whom society has forgotten. Their simple goal is to find the \\"truth\\" behind their country's actions.    One man leads this aging, ragtag crew. He has no known past and has taken on the name \\"Oliver Stone.\\" Day and night, Stone and his friends study wild conspiracy theories, current events, and the machinations of government hoping to discover some truth that will hold America's leaders accountable to its citizens. But never in Stone's wildest nightmares could he imagine the conspiracy the Camel Club is about to uncover...    After witnessing a shocking murder, the Club is slammed head first into a plot that threatens the very security of the nation, full of stunning twists, high-stakes intrigue and global gamesmanship rocketing to the Oval Office and beyond. Soon the Club must join forces with veteran Secret Service agent Alex Ford, who becomes an unwilling participant in one of the most chilling spectacles to ever take place on American soil. It's an event that may well be the catalyst for the long-threatened Armageddon between two different worlds, and all that stands in the way of this apocalypse is five unexpected heroes.    My Two Cents Worth    I am a big Baldacci fan because he always fulfills the basic contract with the reader: to tell a great story. His multiple story lines are complex, and he presents a rather large cast of characters, but he is certainly talented enough to keep you in the book and turning pages. I prefer to make appointments to get the most out of his novels - that is to set aside at least an hour at a time to get the most out of the plot. This is surprisingly easy to do as the story unfolds and you lose yourself in the continuous action and brisk pace. This is not one you can follow reading ten minutes at a time.    I have read some reviews that are critical of the characters or the action that occasionally defies reality, but I have never found this to be obtrusive at all; it is a well presented work of fiction that is wonderfully entertaining and satisfying.

0446604844|5.0|Synopsis    Sidney Archer's near-perfect world implodes when her loving husband Jason reportedly dies in an airplane crash. Questions arise when attorneys working on an international high-tech merger worth hundreds of millions of dollars reveals that Jason was stealing corporate secrets that would put the merger in jeopardy.    A savvy FBI agent investigates the crash and becomes suspicious when the evidence suggests that Jason not only sabotaged the plane, but engineered a multi-million dollar embezzlement plot. The loving wife is crushed at the allegations, but is even more shocked when she discovers that her husband had switched planes at the last minute and was likely alive, but missing and thought to be held captive by a group whose ultimate goal was to move in on the action and acquire the corporate merger for a rival company.    With the aid of her lawyer, Sidney sets out to rescue her husband and reveal the truth. She proves to be a capable heroine, outwitting the murderous goons at every turn and uncovering an immense conspiracy that holds Jason's future in the balance. * * *    My Two Cents Worth    My fifth Baldacci in the past month, you could call me a fan. Okay, I am a avid fan, but for good reason - he knows how to tell a story. His research is remarkable, allowing him to write with discipline and precision.    The industrial espionage theme of the book moves with an electric pace and I found myself completely captured by the plot. I read 140 pages in the first sitting, which was enough for me to find it difficult to get out of my mind. I actually got out of bed, unable to sleep, and read another 92 pages. This is a rare event for me. I was also aware that I did not read nearly the 100 page per hour that I usually average for the standard size paperback.    The only problem I had with the book was with the character of Sidney Archer late in the book. I was with her until the action found its way to the east coast and she left home to save her man.  She morphed from a young and intelligent mother of a two-year-old girl into a mercenary that would have make Rambo blush. I applauded her mission, but found it a stretch to believe that she had more lives than an alley cat.    If you are a fan of espionage, intrigue and high-action, give Total Control a read.

0316143472|3.0|This book is just mundane.  I hate to say it, but Sedaris has gotten old and apparently with oldness comes boringness.  \\"Naked\\" is one of my all-time top 5 books.  But now, well, David Sedaris has given up all his faults and vices, except for being anal (pun kind of intended).<br /><br />The book starts out strong, typically hilarious slice-of-life Sedaris, but then he gets all into quitting smoking and it turns into the kind of self-improvement stuff I just have no time for.<br /><br />I can't believe I'd ever say this about the man I once considered my favorite author, but I didn't even finish the book.

The movie is good and I do recommend it because there is something romantic about it, something that attracts you into watching it. The two leads are wonderful together and there is no doubt about that and I truly hope that they get to do another one together.
B00000J7JO|5.0|After the lacklustre 'One Hot Minute', the Chili Peppers got their mojo back in the best possible way with 'Californication'; their best and most consistent album. Most people credit the return of John Frusciante for the turnaround, and it's true he makes a big difference. Frusciante displays a surpising range of influences, varying his playing from metallic shredding to tender, melodic solo work. His diversity comes as a welcome change from the rather stiff Dave Navarro, whose style just wasn't suited to the band.     However, the remainder of the band have improved their approach as well. Anthony Kiedis' singing is much stronger, and there are some surprisingly strong backup vocals and harmonies on many tracks. Also, Kiedis' lyrics are a bit more thoughtful and emotional than before. And the band in general have re-thought their whole approach, clearly realising that the rather ham-fisted experimentation of 'One Hot Minute' was a dead end. On the surface, they seem to return to the sound of 'Blood, Sugar...', but there is a clear development and maturity on display here, and some subtle twists and turns that work surprisingly well.     Basically there are four different styles on the album:    1) The old-school rap/funk/rock Peppers sound ('Around The World', 'Get On Top', 'Emit Remmus', 'I Like Dirt', 'Purple Stain', and 'Ride On Time'): A clear return to their early sound, but these songs are all given slightly different moods and feels. The frenetic 'Ride On Time' is different from the rock-oriented 'Emit Remmus', which is different again from the sexy/funky 'Purple Stain'. Reflecting the band's increased maturity, these songs are much more melodic than similar tracks from 'Blood, Sugar...'.    2) Mellow ballads ('Otherside', 'Porcelain', 'Road Trippin', 'Californication'): these are all strong songs, and work much better than 'My Friends', for example. Again, there are different feels to each of these; compare the intensity of 'Otherside' versus the very restrained 'Procelain'.     3) The mid-tempo songs with a more pop/rock influence ('Scar Tissue', 'Easily', 'This Velvet Glove'): really strong hooks and melodies in these songs. 'Scar Tissue' was a deserved hit, and the other two songs are hidden gems of the album.    4) While the band have basically airbrushed 'One Hot Minute' out of their history, hints of that album's sound are evident in the straightforward hard rock of 'Parallel Universe' and the vaguely prog-rock 'Saviour', with its shifting moods and tempos.     And everything works. The band sound equally comfortable on everything from the most frantic rap/metal to the tenderest ballads. There are literally no weak songs or awkward moments to be heard here. If you wanted to be really picky, you could argue that 'Porcelain' is a bit under-developed, and 'Ride On Time' something of a throwaway, but that's all. It's pretty much the perfect album, and it fits together well considering the diversity of the individual tracks.     With 'Californication', the Chili Peppers reminded everyone why they were one of the best rock bands of the 90's. The album also looks forward to the more sophisticated direction of 'By The Way'. This is simply one of the best albums of the decade, and is an essential purchase.

B002Q4U9YU|4.0|Before I get to the review of the actual product, I just want to say one thing about Michael Jackson, the man. I have been a fan and collector of his music all my life, accumulating a number of CD's, t-shirts, and even Barbie dolls in his likeness. So when he passed away this last summer, it was really disheartening for someone like me, who actually appreciated him in his lifetime, to see him suddenly deified and commercialized in so many ways. Even a year ago you'd be hard pressed to find someone admit to liking Michael Jackson, but now that he's gone he's \\"cool\\" again. Hypocrisy at its finest.<br /><br />But anyhow, whether the \\"This Is It\\" CD would have been released as a treat to his fans anyway or if it's just another attempt to capitalize on his image after his death, I don't know, but either way it's actually a high-quality collectible that should be appreciated by both hardcore fans and casual/new fans alike. With so many MJ compilation albums available, this may at first seem like a pointless purchase, and in many ways it is redundant. When it was first announced that this album was going to be released, I was under the impression that all the songs would be updated remixes of the versions he was was planning on performing in concert, but unfortunately that isn't the case after all. The main incentive here is the one new song, a ballad called \\"This Is It,\\" which actually isn't new at all as it is a demo recording from the 1980s, with newly recorded background vocals from the rest of the Jackson brothers. I personally find it underwhelming and dare I say boring, but at this point it's being marketed as his swan song so it's kind of bittersweet. Disc 2 is a short collection of unreleased rarities, with three demos of early songs and a spoken poem. The standout is a nearly acapella version of \\"Beat It,\\" a very interesting take on a song we all know so well.<br /><br />The real treat here is the packaging. Bound in a hardcover case, is a 36-page booklet chock full of photos from the This Is It concert rehearsals, many of which are previously unseen. My only concern is that the sleeves which hold the discs are not entirely sealed along the bottom, with only a small dab of glue at either end keeping them together. I'm sure regular wear and tear will eventually take its toll and cause the discs to slip out altogether. Overall I rate this item pretty highly, even though much of it is just a rehash of music we already have, because all taken together it's the closest a lot of us will get to experiencing the stage show we'll never get to see, and it proves once again that his music is amazing and timeless no matter how many times you hear it.om the This Is It concert rehearsals, many of which are previously unseen.

B002MW50KO|1.0|Sorry Amazon won't let you less than a single star rating on an item. This album is not even worth giving it a single star more like a minus 5 stars!<br /><br />I have been a Bob Dylan fan since the 1960's, but this is the worst of Bob Dylan that I have ever heard. Everything else that he has ever done was top notch, but this is the slug at the bottom of the barrel. Bob has never a great singer because he made his voice sound raspy to sound like his hero Woody Guthrie.  This album is horrible and it sucks!  After hearing this I would say its time to retire and give up singing.  It definitely sounds like Bob is over the hill, or it is just a pathetic attempt to convince himself and others that he is a christian. Give it up and go back to Judaism. It is not worth the shame and to sound like you are washed up. Bob actually sounds like he is trying to imitate Leon Redbone doing a Xmas album.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|Let me begin this by saying that I am a very big Terminator fan. I loved the three previous films, the third being the weakest in my opinion, and even loved the way that the television series was so true to the mythology of The Terminator. Though the Terminator Salvation did stay true to the mythology in terms of characters, location and historic story development.it simply fell short. Mc.G is an okay director....though the only thing I really half like of his is Charlies Angels full throttle. The cast is outstanding, and do put in a good performance...but the overall story of the film is wanting. Unlike the previous Terminator outings this film is not about fighting the future...instead this film is about a futuristic fight. The Terminator story line was simplified into a futuristic war movie. Don't get me wrong...it was kinda cool to see the war with the machines in live action...but they could have and should have done more to make this story not only follow the mythology but \\"feel\\" like a Terminator film, quite literally you could have called this film Transformers 1 1/2 and it would have been just as good. The need for the future to be unknown, changing, and chasing after the present is one of the coolest things about the Terminator movie franchise and is one of the things that is desperately missing from this film...and keeps it from fitting comfortably in the Terminator series.<br /><br />I literally felt robbed after this film, not only does the film not feel like a Terminator movie...but after its all said and done, as a viewer you realize that it was nothing more than a set up for a squeal. The failure for the Production Team to get the idea of the Terminator Mythos correct is devastating to this movie, and the shotty writing and reliance on spacial effects to carry the film is it's downfall. In short this movie is allot of popcorn fun...but a very bad Terminator Movie.

0439023491|5.0|When somebody told me that HUNGER GAMES was a top 5 read, I didn't believe it. I read it, just to prove them wrong, and within a chapter, I was hooked. Suzanne Collins brewed up a really good stew, and never left out the ingredients needed to make it amazing! And with CATCHING FIRE out, I just had to wonder what Collins had lined up for us this time. To put it simply, every single time I looked for the fastball, the curve got me most of the time! That's how good Suzanne Collins is!<br /><br />Back in the life of Katniss, you'd think it was all golden. When in reality, it is somewhat sweet and sour. It's great that she won the games, but everybody seems to be taking it in different strides. Some even seem a little cold hearted, not to mention the feeling of the Capitol itself, cold blooded! Some people you grow to like more and more, and some of them, you just can't trust. Rebellion is in the air. And a victory tour is in the midst as well. To boot, Katniss and Peeta have to be quite convincing. Is it possible? There comes a point where you know betrayal will rear it's ugly head. And all the while, the Mockingjay sings the song it desires to sing.<br /><br />It is said that Collins is working on book #3, and the release is TENTATIVELY slated for 2010. I suppose tentative is an ideal word for the conclusion to this trilogy. I just can't imagine what will be revealed. I've read both of these books, and I'm HUNGRY for whatever Collins has to offer. Whether the flavor is sweet or sour, rebellion will happen, and this is really going to get interesting! How interesting can Suzanne Collins really make it? I guess we'll find out, and we won't really know what to expect. Not at all!
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown is an author I will always pick up since I find his novels very entertaining.  This is the fifth one I have read and I liked this one better than \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\" but less than \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" (my favorite).<br /><br />This one was very similar and style and tone to both DaVinci and A&D, but seemed to be a bit more formulaic and a re-do of those novels just set in a different location.  The three main things that bothered me about this novel:  1) the main character of Robert Langdon reappears to take center stage again but seems to be more dense and, at times, just oblivious and constantly in need of help from other sources.  2)  As I was reading, I began to grow weary of the characters looking at something that the reader isn't privy to, being amazed and enlightened by it, and then the next chapter starts without the reader knowing what had been revealed.  While it can heighten the suspense, after multiple usages of the device, I just was annoyed and impatient.  3)  Three characters go through incredible physical trauma but within hours manage to flit around Washington with a huge amount of stamina and no after-effects.  It stretches the reader's ability to believe that people can be near death and a couple of hours later are able to fully function and are just \\"tired\\".<br /><br />Even with the negatives of this novel, I still found it enjoyable.  My personal take is that if this weren't a Dan Brown book and if it didn't have all the hype associated with it, people would find it entertaining and a good read.  It's just not a novel that can stand up to all the expectations - not an \\"it\\" book in my opinion but a fun one anyway.

B0000DIXDR|3.0|Patrick Swayze 1952-2009. The year was 1963, Kennedy was alive and screwing, women's lib was on the verge of eruption, the summer of love was just around the corner, and the Houseman family are spending the last few days of summer at Kellerman's Resort in the Catskills. Dr. and Mrs. Jake Houseman are part of the more affluent middle-class who probably make their home somewhere in Long Island and are unabashed intellectual liberal snobs. Their daughters Lisa and Baby (real name Frances after Frances Perkins) couldn't be more of the cliched big sister/little sister polar opposites: Baby is an intellectual idealist who was more than likely forced into university (and don't you just love how Jake talks over his daughter as she suffers through a dance with the owner's nephew that she's going to be an English major when she tells him she's going for economics- get that MRS from a hotelier my dear!) and Lisa is an oblivious brushoff who is going to get hitched to the first Wall Street trader that knocks her up (interior design school be damned!). All of a sudden the roguish Johnny Castle bounds into the dance hall to samba his way into the gowns of all desperate housewives to sell dance lessons- all else verboten or it's your a$$, you working-class southern hick! Then baby carries a watermelon, pays for Penny's abortion, does a half-a$$ed performance with Johnny, he pops her cherry, and they dance to a Bill Medley classic bringing together rich and poor, opening the floodgates of freedom and love, and the rest history...    Thank God I was 13 when I finally saw this saccharine-coated load! Now I distinctly remember the TV ads for Dirty Dancing back in '87, and I think it's a bit of false advertising. I was expecting something along the lines of 9 1/2 Weeks or Wild Orchid mostly because of the tight, grainy black and white shots of writhing bodies and the bright fuchsia title font. Who knew such a suggestive title could sell such an innocuous, and at times comical romance that revolved around rather intricate dancing. Dancing With the Stars my a$$! I think Eleanor Bergstein was going for a Pride & Prejudice spin on her romantic pratfalls when she was a teen mambo queen bumming around Catskills luxury resorts. I give this film three stars because the only thing that hooks me is the dancing, the soundtrack, and the realistic hardscrabble lives of undiscovered professional dancers who will do anything to survive.    The cheap thrill for me (and I suspect many others) is Baby's initial descent into the dark side. Now she \\"wanders\\" into the staff quarters and sees one of the lackeys struggling with watermelons. Now he makes fun of her for dancing with his wannabe boss, but he's impressed with Baby's sass (as well as sincerity) and they cross the bridge (ooh, symbolism alert! Death! End of innocence! SEX! SEX! SEX!). I can't help but equate the scene where they approach this gigantic, dimly-lit barn-like structure with Joyce Carol Oates' Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been? where Connie plays pretend in the diner where the big kids hang out. So lackey butt bumps the doors open to reveal a rock n' roll orgy of fierce looking sweaty people grinding away to Do You Love Me as Baby muddles uncomfortably through the throng of sin. Johnny and Penny flash through the doors to the wild adulations of their fellow upstarts and take their place as the brother and sister king and queen of dirty dancing. Baby can't take her eyes off Johnny's tight abs and matching a$$ and Johnny gives her a once-over making her feel 2 inches tall before teasing her onto the dance floor. It all plateaus from there.     All in all a distracting coming-of-age flick that could only get better with time or get wrecked with a sequel. And Dirty Dancing has weathered the storm of both gracefully.
B00006JDVV|1.0|The last part of this movie would not play and it had glitches throughout the movie.  Wasn't real impressed with this one!

0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is an emotional story that would fit very well in a high school curriculum. The novel takes place in the future but is highly rooted in the Cold War era. It tells the story of a young boy who is drafted by the military to be the world's hero in the final war against an alien race of insect-like creatures. The reader will be sympathetic to Ender and also be discouraged by him. The novel has amazing characterization. Readers should feel something for each character, no matter how minor. There are many supplementary materials for this book including sequels and comics to incorporate into teaching lessons. This book can also be taught alongside the Cold War in a social studies class.
B002BIMNDQ|5.0|Most entertaining book I've read in the past 10 years.   I recommend reading this to ANYONE. And it's absolutely hilarious!  It will hopefully get translated into many languages so that more  people can benefit from it!
1577314808|1.0|This is an entry into a new way of seeing and being, and Tolle breaks down the process with crystal clear prose, if one can slow down enough to allow the shift in perception that our culture makes difficult. This is a guidebook. You have to practice what you learn. But I've not seen another spiritual book that lays out the situation we are born into as human beings--and the solution, which is, after all, beyond language--in as clear and deep and thorough a way.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I remember seeing \\"Paper Moon\\" when it was first released. I was eleven at the time, and developed a crush on little Tatum O'Neal! The film had director Peter Bogdanavich's sweeping vision of the Depression era, but it was also an ideal vehicle for the father-daughter team of Ryan & Tatum. Relatives doing movies together can be a tricky thing--you're never sure if there's going to be great chemistry on screen. Lucky for us, the chemistry here is terrific (it was good enough to earn first-timer Tatum an Oscar win). The late, great Madeline Kahn even wanders in halfway through the film as exotic dancer Trixie Delight, bringing some funny moments with a slight touch of pathos in her characterization (and earning her a nomination as well).   Shot on location in & around Kansas/Missouri, Bogdanavich's black & white visual look perfectly captures the wide-open isolation of the nation's countryside, decades before buildings & shopping centers cluttered up the land. Attention to authenticity is apparent in every frame, from the dirt roads, vintage cars & weathered buildings to the old radio broadcasts, right down to Addie's \\"Cremo\\" box.   It's a small, subtle gem of a picture, a blend of comedy, drama & visual style.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Enfant terrible to muzak schmoozer...<br /><br />What kind of voyage is Dylan on?<br /><br />Let's first examine some lyrical comparisons...<br /><br />* 1966 - \\"the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face...\\" (Visions of Johanna).<br /><br />* 2009 - \\"Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus...\\" (Here Comes Santa Claus).<br /><br />* 1978 - \\"Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled', Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field...\\" (Senor Tales of Yankee Power).<br /><br />* 2009 - \\"Whose got a big red cherry nose?

I found myself humming Jingle Bells (not on the album) in October. But is this a good thing?<br /><br />Yup - the times they are a changin'.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.   The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.   I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful \\"Beetlejuice\\" animated episodes).   However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Contrary to Dylan's slapstick Christmas In the Heart, this is a serious work of reverent and inspired musicianship.<br /><br />About half of the fifteen songs celebrate what Sting describes as the \\"magical elements\\" of Christmas. The rest are more generally seasonal in focus. As Sting explains in the very comprehensive liner notes, \\"...we are gathered here to celebrate and explore the music of Winter, the season of frosts and long dark nights\\".<br /><br />And yes - the otherworldly mood of winter is conjured up as seven musicians \\"wrapped in scarves and coats\\" collaborate and improvise with uncommon excellence.<br /><br />Traditional instruments, Celtic overtones, and the voice of the former Police lead vocalist now sounding decidedly choral, come together to warm the heart in a most surprising way.<br /><br />I particularly like Soul Cake, with background vocals by the Webb Sisters (the sublime Webb Sisters according to Leonard Cohen), which weaves the melody of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen into the music of Paul Stookey. Gabriel's Message with haunting horn work by Ibrahim Maalouf, and Sting's own The Hounds of Winter are other standouts.<br /><br />The low points for me are Cold Song and Now Winter Comes Slowly, the two pieces with music by baroque composer Henry Purcell. Sting reaches, but clearly can't pull off the basso profondo needed to do justice to these works.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is a very good CD that I'll be going back to time and time again, even though it clearly isn't what Sting fans might expect from the erstwhile rocker. Interestingly, the iTunes database identifies the genre as \\"pop\\". It's decidedly not...<br /><br />Notwithstanding Sting's disclaimer as to his agnosticism, this is a profoundly spiritual work. As he writes, \\"...the sacred symbolism of the Church's art still exerts a powerful influence over me\\".<br /><br />Indeed. As he put it many years ago when writing for the Police, \\"We are spirits in the material world\\"...
B002OB9KPE|4.0|This is not a review.  This is a thank you.      Thank you to Neal and Roine, who 15 or so years ago fronted bands that got me interested in music again.  Thank you to Mike, who is such a beast of a drummer he could seemingly play anything wants, for choosing to be involved in this project (and yes Mike, you do ROCK).  To Pete, not so much thanks but congratulations.  Congratulations for being a prog rock bassist who has survived despite starting your career in the 1980s.   And finally, thank you to all 4 for coming together again to make more music, especially to Neal for deviating from his calling to work on this.     As for the music.  Listened to it once through in the background.  So far, I'd have to say it sounds like, well, Transatlantic. The 78 minute song is clearly broken into distinct songs, but from what I can tell they blend together into a concept of sorts.      The bonus disc looks like it has some interesting covers and I can tell you Roine's bluesy \\"Lenny Johnson\\" and Neal's ballad \\"For Such a Time\\" are both good songs (if not prog).      If you like what they've done in the past, my guess is you will like and appreciate this as well.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|OK first and formost, excelent and fast shipping recieved before I said I would even on standard shipping.  Now to the movie, all I can say is Snow White on blu-ray is trurly a sight to behold.  Disney did a fantastic job with the print and looks awesome, well as awesome as a movie of that age can look.  Sleeping Beauty actually looked better, but for the age it was fantastic.  Buy it to add to your collection, well worth it.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I really enjoyed this book up until the last 50 or so pages. I found the characters engaging, the plight of a state official who confronts the system he has work for interesting and the investigation of the crimes to be different then other \\"mystery\\" novels. I wont spoil it for those who have not read it but the end, simply, sucks. Its as if the unusual novel i had been reading for 490 pages suddenly became just like the numerous novels ive read and quickly forgotten. That said i recommend this novel. Maybe you will not find the end as trite as i did.

1597801577|4.0|Paolo Bacigalupi is being heralded as one of Science Fiction's best writers of recent years, having won and being nominated for multiple awards.  His debut novel The Windup Girl caught my eye from the moment I heard the title.  \\"Is this related to Steampunk,\\" I thought?  \\"Is it Green Punk?\\" Which only just before the release received any sort of specific meaning.  It certainly sounded like it could be on both counts.  I was further grabbed by the truly beautiful cover art by Raphael Lacoste.   The final cover actually has a more yellow-tinged look to it to further evoke the smog like conditions of the city.    The Windup Girl is a extremely vivid dystopian future Thailand in a world besieged by food plagues and mistrust. Paolo's superb prose doesn't waste one word in describing the setting.  The world has contracted and segregated itself.  Everything bad that environmentalists now fear has come to pass.  We have run out of fossil fuels, most animal life has died off, and there are massive food famines caused by various food born plagues some of which have terrible effects on humans outside of killing all the crops.      Governments and Nations have toppled.  The oceans are rising and former places of power are now under water. Religious zealousness rules many parts of the world while the majority is controlled by extremely powerful Calorie companies who grow/design the mass of the food supply. Power is generated by Giant elephants called Megodonts and human labor that is wound into springs to power most anything including Airships and other vehicles.    The narrative is broken into 5 view points, which works well to speed things up somewhat through the slow middle.  However, it was difficult to like and connect with many of the characters as they are designed to survive in this terrible future and make some very tough choices sometimes too easily.  Even the Windup Girl character is hard to to sympathize with, which is surprising given the despicable things done to her.  You can't feel at all for the Calorie Man and Jaidee who is supposed to come off as a hero of sorts is more of a disappointment even to the end.    The Steampunk aspect is more like Clockpunk with the spring tech, but I wish it was described a bit more in depth. Especially in regards to the functioning of the New People or Windups as they are more commonly known. Even with this element I'd say this is as close to Green Punk as anything I've read so far.  The Green Punk mentions are apt in regards to the way people now have to make use of every scrap they have since production of goods is now much more difficult and costly.  And this definitely does not have steampunk's romanticized view of things and focuses on believable technology.  In fact this is a future that is all too real for my liking and very depressive in nature.    Bacigalupi  is a voice that must be heard.  Paolo's work is sure to influence the next generation of writers, but I fear he will become a writers' writer. Meaning that he'll garner high praise and good reviews, but not the large sales he truly deserves for the almost too realistic views and ideas of a future I hope never happens.  In the end The Windup Girl is a bit too depressing for my taste but it has an amazing setting with a great opening and almost as good ending yet suffers in the middle with a less than great storyline and mostly unlikeable characters.  I give The Windup Girl 7 out of 10 Hats.  Paolo's style may be a bit too post modern for some tastes, but his work is light years ahead of what most authors are willing to try.  Readers of Ian McDonald's River of Gods and China Mieville would absolutely love The Windup Girl. Bacigalupi has left the door open for at least more short stories in this world, which I would check out.
B002MBAJ4M|4.0|The good news is that the Gov't Mule sound is completely intact. And literally adding fuel to the fire is new bassist Jorgen Carlsson, who's ferocity adds another dimension to the jam band masters.  His opening bass line on the first track \\"Broke Down on the Brazos\\" is startling, you easily forget that Billy Gibbons is guesting on the song.  Carlsson propulsive and innovative playing proves to be the perfect foil for Warren Haynes signature style.  There's a little less jamming this time around.  The band has never sounded tighter, Haynes vocals never more soulful.  \\"Any Open Window\\" and \\"Inside Outside Women Blues # 3\\" sound like an homage to Hendrix and his legendary rhythm section.  Haynes never really strays far from what this band is all about, yet there's new vitality in this intoxicating mix of southern blues rock.  It's hard to imagine but this might just be the best work this band has ever produced.  Yes, it's that good!
B002C6K7NU|5.0|Ho aspettato molto prima di pubblicare questo post, un pò per mancaza di tempo ma soprattutto perchè volevo ascoltare bene il Cd in questione prima di parlarne, per non essere influenzato dall' entusiasmo di avere tra le mani un nuovo lavoro di una band che amo tantissimo al di là del discorso strettamente musicale.    Ed ecco finalmente in mio possesso questo God e Guns , il tanto atteso nuovo lavoro dei Lynyrd Skynyrd che ha già scatenato i fans di tutto il mondo tra detrattori ( pochi comunque ) e sostenitori di questo album e sul quale dico subito la mia prima di entrare nel dettaglio : bellissimo, mi piace, lo trovo molto divertente e coinvolgente, ottime canzoni ( l'unica che non mi piace è Floyd )  , si ascolta con grande piacere e mi lascia un senso di grande soddisfazione e carica emotiva dopo l'ascolto...ma vediamo di approfondire e puntualizzare il discorso.    Sono passati ben sei anni dall'ultimo lavoro in studio degli Skynyrd , quel Vicious Cycle del 2003 che celebrava in qualche modo i trent'anni di prestigiosa ma tormentata storia della band di Jacksonville, e nel frattempo il destino ha continuato ad accanirsi sui membri di questa strana e sfortunata famiglia con la scomparsa prima di Hughie Thomasson poi di Ean Evans e Billy Powell che hanno avuto comunque  il tempo di collaborare in parte alla realizzazione  di questo progetto .    Il titolo , God e Guns , rappresenta in due semplici parole l'essenza della storia e dello spirito del popolo americano,  come ha recentemente dichiarato Johnny Van Zant in diverse interviste,  e la canzone che porta lo stesso titolo all'interno dell'album ne è il manifesto, e in effetti non si può dargli torto rivisitando la storia più e meno recente degli Stati Uniti d'America in tutte le sue varie evoluzioni, rivoluzioni e sfaccettature.    Va detto che il sound dei Lynyrd si è fatto nel tempo sempre meno blues e sempre più country rock oriented nello stile dei fratelli Van Zant intesi come Johnny e Donnieche in coppia hanno realizzato alcuni ottimi album in perfetto stile country rock, e in questo album ne abbiamo conferma in pezzi come Simple Life, ennesima dichiarazione d'amore per la propria terra, le proprie radici, le proprie tradizioni e diciamo pure un orgoglio sudista mai sopito così come in Southern Ways,  Unwrite That Song, That Ain't My America e la stessa God e Guns dalla suggestiva iniziale atmosfera western, mentre l' influenza stilistica quasi hard rock di Rickey Medlocke si sente maggiormente in Still Unbroken , pezzo quantomai rivelatore della natura della band alla luce della loro storia recente anche se è un pezzo che giaceva nei casseti da tempo sempre da dichiarazioni di JVZ, Little Thing Called You e Comin' Back for More con un sound comunque molto arioso che potremmo quasi definire \\" commerciale \\" senza sminuirne comunque la qualità, continuando in ogni caso a raccontare storie e situazioni di una America che è molto più presente e reale di quanto non si creda, rimarcando ancora una volta che l'America non è solo New York e le varie luccicanti metropoli che abbiamo quotidianamente sotto gli occhi.    Inutile dire che i fans più accaniti e nostalgici della band storcono il naso di fronte a sonorità così differenti dalle origini, esistono infatti addirittura gruppi in rete che considerano i Lynyrd Skynyrd un gruppo musicale solo fino al tragico 1977 punto e basta, atteggiamento a mio parere assurdo così come è assurdo fare paragoni tra la band attuale e il passato considerando che è rimasto il solo Gary Rossington a testimoniarne le origini e la storia, tralasciando il discorso su Rickey Medlocke che entrando fugacemente come drummer ne è uscito praticamente subito pare per forti contrasti col leader Ronnie Van Zant.    Parliamo di epoche musicali diverse, alchimie tra persone , amici , musicisti purtroppo irripetibili e quindi non ha alcun senso paragonare il sound delle origini con quello attuale, semplicemente si può giudicare se le canzoni e i concerti sono ancora degni di attenzione e io trovo che lo siano assolutamente , ma a mio parere ancora di più continuare ad essere fan dei Lynyrd Skynyrd nel tempo significa far parte di una comunità , di una grande enorme famiglia, significa amare un simbolo e una icona della musica, nel bene e nel male.    Due parole infine sulla bellissima confezione della Special Edition che contiene 2 CD con 3 bonus track e 3 pezzi live in più rispetto alla edizione normale, un bellissimo libretto con tutti i testi e suggestive fotografie e soprattutto un commosso e doveroso ricordo di Billy Powell e Ean Evans con una bellissima foto e dedica.
B002OB9KPE|4.0|I purchased the super deluxe version with the extra CD and the Making of DVD.  First of all, Bridge Across Forever is one of my fave CD's and Stranger in Your Soul is one of my favorite prog songs.   The Whirlwind CD is very good, and, compared to the other two Transatlantic CD's, is more consistent throughout. Bridge and SMTPe had some weak areas (Temple of the Gods).   One of the things that really stands out on the Whirlwind is the bass and guitar. The fairly well known rumors of grumbling by Roine and Pete over Bridge (and Roine's re-release of his own mix as proof) are not necessary here. The bass is strong with excellent tone! (I actually envy this bass tone). Roine's guitar parts are well executed with good tone, unlike the spacey wah-fest filler from Bridge.   The lyrics are overall very good. Some of Neal's vocals as usual are borderline too high; will be difficult to do live.  My favorite songs are The Wind Blew Them All Away, Rose Colored Glasses, EverMore, and the Finale. Although this is one big song it fits together nicely and some stand up on their own well.  This would be 5 stars.    The bonus CD (CD2) is hit and miss. The first four songs are new, but I really don't like any of them. Lenny Johnson has an interesting feel but it really doesn't go anywhere. For Such a Time is basically like I Can Only Imagine and would play well on Contemporary Christian (CCM) charts. Since I don't like candy-coated CCM, this is not necessarily a good thing.   These songs wouldn't be all that bad, but the Giant Hogweed song is SO GOOD that it makes these look like less than filler. The Giant Hogweed song has interesting parts, dynamics, funny vocals, and a great, fun feel. This song is 5 stars. The CD, however, is about 3 stars.  The Making of DVD is the usual. Not bad but about 15-20 minutes of interesting content in 90 minute DVD.
B0018CVQFM|5.0|I am not a big time fan of CSN, but some how I always felt that there is a distinguished voice among them, until one day I bought the cd called American Dream.  When I listened to the two songs \\"Clear Blue Skies\\" and \\"Soldiers Of Peace\\", I knew that this is the man that made the band.  I always wondered why doesn't he have a box set?  Then a week ago I was in a music store looking for something new, something different, when I came face to face with Reflections.  I had in my hand what I was looking for, or what I was hoping for.  It was a must buy for me.  I know it is very expensive, but it comes down to paying almost a dollar a song.  Not bad.  This guy has an Angelic voice.  What ever he sings, I'll listen.  By the way, if you listen to \\"Liar's Nightmare\\", it is the music of \\"Masters Of War\\", by Bob Dylan.    Peace.

B002QP145C|5.0|This war movie has to rate as one of the greats!  The plot begins as tried and true; soldiers say goodbye to sweethearts, wonder how they will fare when faced with combat, try to get another sweetheart along the way, etc.  Then the waves of Russians are on them!!  From there on it is full-tilt gritty and very well done.  Unlike most war films, the viewer gains a sense of how quickly soldiers become weary veterans and how the ragged few who remain gain a sense of fatalism when surrounded by so much death.  The battle scenes are plentiful and memorable.  No cheesy gasoline explosions here. Hollywood should be jealous that a small budget Finnish movie can deliver a knockout blow at 1/100th the cost.
B000FSME1A|5.0|This is my favorite \\"Vietnam War\\" film, though it is more of an anti-war film set during the war.  The characters and soundtrack are all likeable and eccentric, and some humor is thrown in at times.  The director's cut adds a lot of previously-unseen footage, most of which adds to the film's side stories and character backgrounds.  Overall a very powerful visual depiction of the chaos and confusion of war.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I've watched it about 6 times... I liked it...!  Especially the part where everybody dies..... LOL
B002DKGWSE|4.0|It's quiet hard to make critical comments to such a piece of work.First if you've already seen the ORIGINAL you have the best preperation for this one.If not be warned this chiller makes you feel uncomfortable from the beginning.Is it the story or it is just the question through this whole picture WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I don't wanna start this whole Vigilante discussion but the film gives the best excuse.  The Movie itself is perfectly made, i find it even better in some scenes most of all the family situaton.Goldwyn and Potter are truly believable and Dillahunt as Krug is abolutely first grade.  The DVD itself has good transfer, the sound is ok, the extras are some deleted scenes and a small doc.  I strongly advice this one not to be watched alone,it could deliver some dicussion points.  Strongly Recommended.

B002NPUCRQ|4.0|After the success of [[ASIN:B001EYGOEM Fearless]], Taylor Swift and her label decided to re-release it. With some re-releases, you get shoddy remixes or re-toolings of the big hits, perhaps an acoustic version or two and a live track. Not so with the platinum edition. This is more of an extended version of the original album than the simple run-of-the-mill repackaged original version. The platinum edition has five entirely new tracks, plus a piano/acoustic version of the original release's \\"Forever and Always\\". What makes the new tracks and re-release worth purchasing is that you're definitely getting an improved and superior version of 'Fearless'; the new tracks are mixed in with the originals and you can't really tell that they were produced any differently than the original tracks. They are of the same quality and caliber, enhancing the experience of listening to Taylor Swift. They aren't much different from the originals; these new songs are mostly about young love, ambivalence, optimism (even in the face of heartache or tarnished relationships).<br /><br />The Good: This isn't the typical 'country' music many are familiar with. Taylor Swift, having written most of the songs herself, brings a lot of her personal experiences and reflections into the music and the songs feel more authentic. While she's in the genre of country there's also a heavy presence of pop running throughout the tracks. 'Fearless' has a theme to it; songs about young experience and \\"fearlessness\\" in the face of many obstacles and new experience; on the track \\"Fifteen\\" she sings about school and not exactly fitting in, an experience everyone can relate to in some way. On \\"Hey Stephen\\" and \\"You Belong To Me\\" she sings of crushes and young love. \\"Jump Then Fall\\" is all about taking a chance on love. The mass appeal of Taylor Swift is probably how relatable her music and persona is. Unlike many artists her age who are singing about partying in clubs or trying to make 'country music' that's either too stereotypical or too dance-orientated, she's singing about life and things she and everyone experiences and goes through. Another good thing about this edition is that it comes with a DVD of the music videos from the singles released as well as some behind-the-scenes footage. For me, this enhances the experience because you're able to see and hear the creative process and witness how involved she is. It helps to also get the point across that there's a real person behind the music and lyrics and she's not just a puppet or product of her music label and the industry. Also, the video of her CMA performance of 'Thug Story' with T-Pain, a definite fan-favorite moment of the past year, is included and makes the DVD a true must-have. Sure, it's silly and definitely not country but it shows the versatility of Swift and her willingness to make fun of herself and have fun.<br /><br />The Bad: There's not a lot to complain of. If there's a flaw to the album is that it can be a bit light and upbeat. The tone of the album, even when she sings of unpleasant feelings and of insecurities or unfulfilled loves, she never truly goes 'deep' or to a pure unhappy place. It gets a bit annoying that emotionally the album feels a little heavy on the positive and optimistic vibes, but again, that's a personal criticism. \\"You're Not Sorry\\" is probably the least 'happy' song with the new track \\"Untouchable\\" following close behind. Also, a minor nit-pick but the cover artwork doesn't reflect that this is really a new product. All that it looks like is the designer or label being lazy and short on time and sticking a black background behind the same photo from the first released. Perhaps the thought was that the black background and 'platinum edition' added in would give the impression of newness but the black background and her expression change the vibe or tone of the album from upbeat and optimistic to slightly moodier and depressing, which the album and music are not. Minor critique that doesn't detract much from the music. The new tracks are good but it would have been nice if the label also included many 'pop' versions of her singles that have been released through iTunes and other online venues over the course of the year.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|We owned an old VHS copy of the film. The DVD and Blu-Ray set are certainly worth the upgrade.

B000003S0F|5.0|If you are looking for great rock music of the early 1970s, the golden era of rock, look no further. The music of King Crimson has possibly influenced as many bands and musicians as that of Pink Floyd's. King Crimson is one of the most prolific rock bands ever and Robert Fripp one of the most influential musicians of all time. They have been releasing great albums since 1969 to this date. My favorite phase of their musical development was the very beginning, their first 4 albums, which I find more peaceful and beautifully structured. I am sure to many fans of this great band what is missing in these early albums is  world class drums and bass, heavy riffs changing the tempo of music. To me this is the perfection of that early music of King Crimson. They were able to achieve variety and complexity of their progressions by other means. The first album, In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969), with Greg Lake (who left shortly before completing their second album to establish EL&P) is such a classic and novelty that its place in the history of rock music has been established for ever. However, what unites the following 3 albums In The Wake Of Poseidon (1970), Lizard (1970) and Islands (1971) is the absolutely superb mastery of flutes and saxes by Mel Collins. The jazzy feeling of these 3 albums has a lot to do with Keith Tippett, a jazz piano player who participated here as well. The following album Larks' Tongues In Aspic started the saga of the new King Crimson lineup with Bill Bruford on drums and John Wetton on bass and vocals and their sound became much harder and heavier.<br />Coming back to Islands, it features 10 musicians including obviously Robert Fripp on guitar, mellotron and Peter's Pedal Harmonium; Mel Collins on flute, bass flute, saxes and vocals; Boz Burrell on bass guitar and lead vocals; Ian Wallace on drums, percussion and vocals; Keith Tippett on piano; Robin Miller on oboe; Mark Charig on cornet; Henry Miller on string bass; Paulina Lucas singing soprano and Peter Sinfield adding lyrics and sounds. The sound of this album is as full as the lineup. Again, for the most part this is more of a peaceful jazz influenced rock suite than your typical rock album, but given time, the effect is spectacular. This album is very even and when I say that the title track could be my favorite, with its prelude Song Of The Gulls, I am probably doing injustice to Formentera Lady and Sailor's Tale which are beautiful and very artistic. My favorite songs of King Crimson are these softer, mellower ones: Cadence And Cascade, Epitaph, Exiles, The Court Of The Crimson King, Song Of The Gulls, Islands, I Talk To The Wind, Lizard - Prince Rupert's Wake, The Night Watch, In The Wake Of Poseidon, Lady Of The Dancing Water. I guess for the most part the above songs could be called the best of early King Crimson. Once again, I absolutely appreciate the greatness of their harder, heavier and later music. I just like to float in more peaceful background more often than not.no and Peter Sinfield adding lyrics and sounds. The sound of this album is as full as the lineup.

B001U7B4T8|2.0|I have this entire concert on Laserdisc (minus for some reason \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\" by a woman singer whose name I can't remember which was on the actual concert. I've watched it many times over the past decades and it never fails to move me. There were a lot of early '80s concert and early '90s concerts which were released on VHS before the DVD appeared and I have found most of them on LaserDiscs although ironically the cheapest place to buy them has been from Japan!<br />This show is essential watching for anyone who loves Dylan. Imagine Dylan and Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young (vocal and guitar solos), George Harrison (vocal), and Eric Clapton (vocal and guitar solos) backed by Booker T. & The MGs and B. T. (with Steve Cropper) and G. T. Smith (Hall & Oates) and Anton Fig on drums doing \\"My Back Pages\\" and you know this is not a show that will disappoint.<br />Dylan is even thrown in for good measure.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|All the way from the packaging to the CD labels to the absolutely, BEAUTIFUL remastering work, it's well-worth the price for BOTH the STEREO and MONO sets!  Sir Paul himself commented that they sound as close to what they heard in the studio as the original masters.  What higher accolade could there be?  All in all, it's a well-overdue remastering job that FINALLY gives justice to the work of George Martin, the engineers and \\"button pushers\\" in Studio 2, and, of course, The Beatles.  --JR
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is a review for the Rhino version with the extended tracks.  The sound quality is wonderful and the packaging is fantastic as well.  I love the extended tracks like I say in my other reviews of Yes albums.  Fragile was the second LP I purchased and it holds up very well today 38 years later.  Rhino can do no wrong so far in my book.

0061914177|5.0|In Crush It, Gary Vaynerchuk lays out a simple road map for entrepreneurial success. If you're ready to get motivated and stop working to put money in someone else's pocket and work hard to put money in yours, this is a great read.    I picked this book up and read it in less than 24 hours. It is a quick read in which Vaynerchuk's voice, wit and humor shines through.     Don't be fooled - this book will not tell you that it's easy to become an entrepreneur and you can do it overnight. Gary V. didn't build his empire in an evening, and you won't either -- but by following his examples, his wise use of social media and his drive to work hard to succeed, you can start to pave the road to living your passion.    This book doesn't disappoint, though. You leave with a sense that the journey will be difficult, but the end result will be worth it.
0882709194|5.0|The reading and comprehension of the FORWARD of this book requires the reader to have a sufficient degree of Agile Mental Capacity.  You cannot choose to be stuck to and married to unproven pseudo-scientific dogma.    The FORWARD of this book is clearly written and does not dictate or lecture to its readers what they must conclude.  You can make up your own mind based on the facts presented.  To do so takes a degree of academic integrity the evolutionary hysterical haters simply do not possess nor are able to generate out of their unreasoning fear that there might be a 'real' truth which would free them from their comfortable shackles of pseudo-academic tyranny  Reading the previously posted attacking reviews, note the repetitive use of the same verbiage which reveals an inability to properly communicate concepts and diminished intellectual capacity.      These are blind and narrow-minded fossilized minds who are rooted and stuck to unproven unscientific presuppositions (even long after they have been proven to be invalid by real scientific peer review - i.e. the Latest Missing Link \\"Ida\\" Holy Grail hype pushed by Jorn Hurum (University of Oslo Natural History Museum) and the History Channel (touted on its show that the 'Ida' discovery was \\"the most important find in 47 million years\\").  These guys all ended up with lots of egg on their faces after spending millions to purchase the \\"Ida\\" fossil and produce their hyping programs only to find out from real scientists that \\"Ida' is really just a part of the cat family.    Why does this FORWARD elicit such moronic hysteria responses and abject fear of Ray Comfort's viewpoints?  It's the fear of the truth and the recognition by the hysterical non-thinkers that their fragile worldview beliefs are placed on a pseudo-science based on the beliefs of a racist, bigoted White supremacist (BTW, Hitler loved Darwin and justified his murder/Holocaust of millions on the basis of Darwin's theories).    If you are truly seeking the truth and of an open mind, read the FORWARD for yourself to consider and keep in context while you read the rest of the book.
B002JIOQCO|4.0|This is a much more mature album but maintains the full on rock influences of their eponymous effort plus a little bit of adventurousness.    The opener 'California Queen' is followed by 'New Moon Rising' and it's not hard to see why both these tracks have been released as singles.  From this great opening pair Wolfmother continue the hard rocking with 'Sundial' offering some Hendrixesque guitar.  'In The Morning' slows things down but only for a moment.  Hardly time to catch your breath before '10.000 Feet' and the title track have one scratching their head for another influence superbly executed.  Think of Budgie circa 1972 and it is very difficult not to draw the conclusion that Stockdale & Co have been exposed to this brilliantly neglected British band.    'Far Away' brings a temporary halt to the sonic barrage with a beautifully crafted song leaving the feeling that you've heard this before but can't remember where or when.  'In The Castle' opens with an almost prog keyboard intro and psychedelic feel before Stockdale hits his strapes again.  The concluding track 'Violence of the Sun' is the most surprising with the band sounding really comfortable with one another playing a mix of jazz and r'n'b with 'wall of sound' drumming.  This is a new improved Wolfmother which will please old fans and probably gain some new ones.    A definite step forward while maintaining the appeal of their first album.  The new line-up gel well together but as before AS is the core and driving force behind Wolfmother.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|I picked this album up out of impulse, and I was largely rewarded.  I had heard no Arctic Monkeys beforehand, but this album has had a lot of praise.  So I bought it, and after a few listens the whole album nearly grew on me.  It sounds like a more mystical Queens of the Stone Age/Muse.  At first, like everyone else, I didn't really dig it, but after a while I couldn't stop listening to it.  The whole album is filled with phenomenal bass and drums complimented with catchy guitar riffs and dark melodies.  Instrumentally its an amazing album.  The frontman had to grow on me, but by now I'm singing all the songs with him.<br /><br />So I'll agree with the rest of the reviews and say, Let the album grow on you.  The only songs i liked right off the bat were \\"Dangerous Animals\\" and \\"Dance Little Liar\\".  I will also say that those songs are the best on the cd, in my opinion.  Other awesome tracks include \\"Pretty Visitors\\",  \\"Crying Lightning\\", \\"Potion Approaching\\" and \\"Fire and the Thud.\\"  The album has a sort of moody stubborn style, which separates it from the formula rock albums.  The concept of the album is what keeps you listening to it.  It an album that moves you slowly but steadily.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Cornerstone\\" and \\"The Jeweller's Hands\\" are yet to grow on me and I doubt they will.<br /><br />This being my first Arctic Monkeys album, I'm quite impressed.  I hope to pick up more of their cds in the future, because they seem like the type of band to always bring something new to the table.  This album has a unique concept and it doesn't sound like any regular rock album.  They have, possibly, the best bassist and drummer out there in the business right now.  This album is a huge success and is now largely owned by way more than just their fan base.  I had no previous experience in listening to this band, and now i gotta say that I'm a fan.  I listen to bands who are concerned with making art instead of selling cds.  Arctic Monkeys are true artists and this album is a beautiful work of art.of art.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|I had a small cosmetic problem with the DVD case I received with my movie. I put the concern out there to the company and before I could predict whether it would matter to them, they RESPONDED. And most agreeably, I might add - all tilted toward the satisfaction of the customer. I actually felt someone was singularly devoting their time and attention to me, not from a customer relations script but from a real sense of trying to understand and remedy my problem. I run a small business myself, and one thing I impress upon my employess is this - mishaps in production and service explain the customer's problem, they do not justify it. That being said, the customer is deserving of something more and above an explanation; they now deserve satisfaction beyond the purchased item. Well, that is exactly what I received. Kudos to the folks at HELVIC55.
0143144766|3.0|I am a fan of detective stories and have not read any of this author's works when I came across a Time Mag review. It had called this a light summer read with less confusing characters and convoluted story line than most of his works. Well I found the story line novel and somewhat engaging but the pseudo Hippy speak was most grading and by the mid point I was almost wishing it would end. But it did pick up toward the end and finished with a satisfactory conclusion. Would I read another? Well I'd most likely pick up a Connelly book 1st.

0061914177|1.0|When I saw the author's interview on CNN, I couldn't wait to get and read the book. After I got the book,I was amazed. How did this thing ever get published? All of these positive reviews, more amazing still. One reviewer, Tracy H. Sells, sees the book for what it is: rambling platitudes, pointless personal experience and stuff about putting your family first. I wanted to specifically know how he did it. The exact techniques, not that anyone can make it in America and that social networking is a game changer. That's old news, appropriate to the late 90s, not at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. His website is impressive, so is his success, but as a book author; no. However, this did lead me to think that the experiences that I am having with social networking, trying to revolutionize the antique industry would be enough material to put out of a book slightly better than Crush It!
B002P6TA94|5.0|Compared to the first album and original lineup, the second album and lineup's sound is much less Zeppelin and more Sabbath. The guitars don't come over the top with their jangly, crunchy stripped-down sound. Instead, they seem to rise up, much more solid and present. There's a sense of girth here, probably due to a more sophisticated studio production process.    This is in no way a bad thing. Andrew Stockdale's vocals really tie things together and form the bridge needed for pilgrims between the first and second iterations of Wolfmother. The idea of album as an evolving being, with songs moving logically and emotionally from the one before it, is improved upon. There is no jarring Apple Tree that pulls you out of the songflow, another sign of the growing sophistication of this Australian band.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|The liner notes are really good.  Sting explains that winter is his favorite season and he deliberately stayed away from holly-jolly merry Christmas songs.  The photos are also awesome, particularly a scene of all the musicians gathered around a bank of candles playing their instruments.  That sets the mood of the piece - rather quiet, introspective and kinda gloomy.  Also on many of the numbers Sting does this really weird thing with his voice, like he stayed up all night smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey.    Several years ago Sting contributed a version of Gabriel's Message to one of the Very Special Christmas CDs for the Special Olympics.  The version on this CD is vastly inferior.    I did like Soul Cake, which I remember from the Peter Paul & Mary Christmas CD many years ago.  Also You Only Cross My Mind in Winter, where Sting adds lyrics to a Bach piece.  Christmas At Sea, which is a Robert Louis Stevenson poem set to a traditional Gaelic song, is pretty good.      The musicianship is extraordinary.  Sting's vocals, not so much.  It seems like a good CD to hunker down with in January, when the wind is howling and Christmas is over and you're already pretty depressed.  It sure isn't like any other Christmas CD you have in your library.
B000V86OKG|5.0|If it were possible the second season of Dexter is perhaps even better than the first. Dexter's new girlfriend, Lila, turns out to be quite the hand full as his relationship with her puts more and more snags into his life.<br /><br />One of the things that really makes this series interesting is the internal monologues that we hear as Dexter comments on life as he goes about his daily life. Often these thoughts are ironic commentaries about the world he is living in as he tries to assimilate into a world of people who seem so different from himself. Given his early childhood trauma of seeing his mother butchered he has suppressed his emotions in order to cope. As a result he goes about through life as a detached observer of life, and the people around him. It is his curse and his advantage over others. He can perhaps see people and situations more clearly than others given that his reason isn't clouded by the feelings, or the norms, that people passively accept or are guided by. Though, on the other hand, this has meant that he has had to work harder than others in order to act normal, which is something everyone else takes for granted.<br /><br />This is an intriguing series which just seems to get better and better with each season.

0061914177|5.0|Hello Gary,<br /><br />I pre-ordered your book because I knew if your name was associated with it then it would be filled with passion and useful information.  One of the things I admire about you is that you give everything of yourself in everything that you do.<br />I have found that books are just like movies, there are really no \\"bad' movies or \\"bad\\" books.  There are just movies that you like and don't like and the same thing pertains to books.  Personally I think something can be learned from every book.<br /><br />I love this book and here's why I love it.  You ask a question in the book that to me is worth the price of the book alone.  The question was \\"are you willing to do whatever it takes for the chance to live entirely on your own terms?\\"  The answer for most are \\"no\\". It's can be a little frightening to put yourself out there and be willing to do whatever it takes.  The funny thing is that when you I ask myself this question I have some ideas of what I might encounter but I can never know for sure.<br /><br />I haven't worked on a job in more than 8 years now.  Personally I would rather die than work for someone else so your book spoke to my very Soul.  The very people that need to read your book probably will never know that it exists.  Most of the people that will read your book are the ones that already know that following one's passion is the only way to go.<br /><br />I get so tired of seeing people live these quiet lives of desperation. Your book provides an idea of what is possible if one would just take the first step.  Thanks for a very intriguing and inspiring book.<br /><br />If everybody liked this book it probably wouldn't be a good book.  I like the fact that you pushed some buttons.  I like the fact that you were authentic and transparent.  For those who didn't like it, I'd like to know what kind of results are they producing in life?<br /><br />You're the man...Gary Vee.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Rick in Dallas
0385504225|3.0|This book was probably one of my least favorite Dan Brown books, but was still fairly good. The plot was like a roller coaster in the sense that sometimes it was good and fast-paced with tons happening and other times it was slow and boring and seemed to not even going toward a climax. Brown has definitely written better in the past. Definitely worth reading for a minor history of D.C.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|I will admit that I was a little skeptical about Wolfmothers new album due to the fact that the band broke up and the only one left standing was the lead singer/guitarist. Personally I think this new line up is better and their sound is better. I can not stop listening to this CD. I got it today and have listened to it literally about 4 times now. I read that they were really into Kyuss and that that was the sound that they were going for. Kyuss is one of my favorite bands and I got to say that they hit the nail on the head. This album is straight up stoner metal. Buy this album now.

B00008WT5C|5.0|I'm not going to break this down song by song, but suffice it to say I have listened to a lot of rock & roll records in my day, and Let There Be Rock is an absolute gem.  The echelon this record reaches is very scarcely populated indeed.  The raw power and crunching riffs on this album are downright addicting and if they can't get your blood pumping, I'd suggest therapy!<br /><br />Bon Scott was the heart and soul of AC/DC; my God, when they drew up the prototype rock & roll singer, Bon was it.  Witty, charming, lyrically funny and clever, and with a voice that could strip paint off the walls, Bon and his mates are awesome on every song here. Ladies loved him and blokes wanted to be like him; I don't recall anyone ever saying anything bad about Bon.  I love every single song on here, including the usual suspects Let There be Rock and Whole Lotta Rosie, but do not overlook a hidden gem in Overdose.  Again, the riffs will sweep you up and blow you completely away.<br /><br />I'm not going to knock the Brian Johnson version of AC/DC.  Brian seems like a great guy and was a very good choice to replace Bon (if such can indeed ever be done).  However, for my money the AC/DC between 1975 and 1979 is absolutely off the charts and all of their CD's should be in your collection if you like good old fashioned a**-kickin' rock and roll.  Few, if any, have ever done it any better.

B002FE5XVK|5.0|I was not a huge Talking Heads fan.  I enjoyed their music but never owned any of their albums.  I have a large collection of concert DVD's and have just recently started purchasing blu-ray concerts.  So I was intrigued by all of the positive reviews I saw for Stop Making Sense.  The concert is excellent.  The band is tight and having fun.  The energy level borders on hysteria,  but it never takes away from the music.  The audio is excellent.  The video quality is average,  but the average quality does not detract from the overall experience.  This is one concert film that I will view over and over.
0739321005|5.0|When I read the book I was fascinated by Obama desribing his own youth, his problems, thoughts, encounters, in such a candid and frank way. I found the idea entrapping to listen to the book being read by the author himself. So I purchased the CD. And I like listening to it.<br />Moreover, I have a dyslexic student who comes to me once a week to study English. I am going to take parts of the book and use it in combination with the CD to train his understanding of written and spoken English.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Received DVD with great speed, new as advertised and all for a great price.  Thank You!
6305428042|4.0|This DVD is a Halloween classic. A childhood favorite and over all family friendly movie, I recommend it to anyone who enjoy cute family type films.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|The Proposal starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is a cute, harmless romantic comedy. Bullock is one of my favorites and parts of this film remind me of While You Were Sleeping (the movie that made her a household name). Reynolds is funny but I don't quite believe the chemistry between him and Bullock, seems kinda forced and off-kilter. The Proposal was better than expected, Sandy never disappoints!
B002P6TA94|4.0|The heaviosity flows freely on this new Wolfmother album.  (Or is it heavitude?)  But I like the fact that this is hard rock as opposed to Heavy Metal.  In other words, it's filled with loud and heavy electric guitars and high-register lead vocals, but the songs don't bludgeon listeners into submission.  For one thing, there's a variety in tempos on the Egg -- it's not all freight train, sometimes it's a limo.  I hear some of what one of the other reviewers described as \\"more Sabbath than Zep\\" on the album, in songs like \\"10000 Feet,\\" but I still hear some Zeppelin in several of the songs too.  My take on these homages to past \\"rock gods\\" is that Wolfmother maintains its originality while incorporating elements that worked so well for great genre bands in previous decades.  It's something I liked about Wolfmother before, and I'm still enjoying it with this new incarnation.<br /><br />Regarding the Deluxe Edition, it's interesting to me that the one-CD version has 12 songs on the disc, but when they added the 4 extra tracks for the Deluxe set, they decided to split up the songs 8 and 8 (eight tracks on each CD).  And the extra tracks are not just stuck on at the end, they are integrated into the song sequence with the original 12 cuts.  So maybe the band is just presenting two different versions of the album?  \\"Shorter\\" and \\"Longer?\\"  I'm interested to learn more about that situation.  Anyway, I'm glad I went for the Deluxe - the four extra songs sound just as good to me as the other twelve!
B001PR0YBM|5.0|I loved this film. It had visuals and was one of the best films although very different than the others from Studio Gibli.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Wolverine, X-Men Origins, was a very good movie that answered a lot of questions concerning Logan's start in life. While it was not a critical success, it was an enjoyable waste of time that is exactly what I got to the movies and buy DVD's. I enjoyed it and I hope that you will too.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|...yet this may be my all-time favorite album (discovered two years after its release).  Fantastic melodies and music and vocals.  So much heart and sincerity...and sorrow, but ultimately optimistic and comforting.  The DVD is beautiful as well.  A highly recommended package, of course.
B002HWUU2C|4.0|I picked up the new The Swell Season CD today, called  Strict Joy. I got the deluxe edition, which has a second CD of live tracks from the last couple of tours. A total of 32 tracks - 13 make up the new CD and 19 are live tracks.    A quick glance at the writing credits of the new songs betrays that this is more of a Glen Hansard album. Marketa Irgolva only has a couple of writing credits. But her voice and piano are very present, and the harmonies are still sweet.    The album opens with a couple of good, solid upbeat tunes (Low Rising and Feeling the Pull). Not until the third song (In These Arms) do we get a song that sounds like the Once soundtrack, with Irglova harmonizing with Hansard over soft acoustic progressions. These three songs were released over the last couple of months as singles on iTunes but this is the first time I had heard any of them.    The fourth song, The Rain, comes back up in tempo with full band and impassioned relationship-based lyrics from Hansard.    In fact, relationships seem to be the theme of this album and there doesn't seem to be any effort to hide the fact that it's a very Fleetwood Mac-ish break-up album. The songs are loaded with references to the on-again off-again nature of Irglova and Hansard's relationship. Lots of songs about longing, people.    But where the Once soundtrack and  The Swell Season CD are mostly softer, acoustic based discs with a couple of rockers, Strict Joy is a better balance.    Not knowing anything at all about these two (except for the movie) when I saw them the first time live, they were mostly acoustic and quiet, which is what I kind of expected. The second time through, however, Hansard had most of his band The Frames with him, and they did lots of really upbeat, rocking numbers. Some of The Frames tunes like Fitzcarraldo were fairly face-melting. That rocking side of the band comes through more on this disc.    A good example is High Horses, which starts out as an arpeggiated, repeating piano riff but really takes off at the end with full band coming in and bringing the energy level waaaaay up. This one will be on par with Fitzcarraldo live. The Verb does something similar structurally, with some very nice call and response vocal trade offs and a great build at the end with a nice use of strings.    Irglova's two songs are strong. Fantasy Man is pretty obviously about Hansard and is well done, with dare I say an Eastern European vibe to it (it would make sense, since that is where she is from). I Have Loved You Wrong is the standout here. I remember seeing this one live and thinking, what the hell is this song? It's a very trancy song, with a repeating bass line and very tasty piano noodlings. But the repeating vocal bit that takes the song out was mind blowing live, and although it is understated on this version, the song is done really well on this disc. Might be her best song.    Suffice it to say, if you like the music from the movie Once, and/or the first Swell Season album, you'll love this. And if you dig The Frames, you'll probably like it too. I am still discovering that band, so I don't have a ton of insight there. But the new material picks up where the last left off, with enough familiarity to link it to the previous work but also with enough of an evolution so that you don't feel like you are listening to a re-hash.     There really isn't a bad track on the CD although the last two songs are a bit sleepy, although very pretty - especially the outro to Somebody Good, which closes the CD with some gorgeous vocal harmonies between Hansard and Irglova. A nice way to wrap up the CD.    And of course you get what amounts to a full live CD as a bonus of you get the deluxe edition. Which is nice.    I reviewed the CD and the last couple of Portland-area live performances on my blog at [...]. Check it out!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I am a \\"newbie\\" buschrafter.  Up until I bought this knife, I only owned pocket knives.  But after viewing many videos on \\"buschcrafting\\" on YouTube, I felt compelled to get a decent knife.  This knife is great.  I used it for \\"batoning\\"/splitting wood.  I know I will not outgrow this knife anytime soon (probably not in my lifetime).  As other reviewers have stated, this is one \\"solid knife\\".  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Looking forward to years of service as I gain experience. In my opinion the value of this knife can not be beat.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|\\"This Is It\\" is a true event. This is real. The effort - that's what counts the most.<br />As Michael said at the last day of his preparations for the concerts:\\"Thank's for taking me this far. I can take it from there. I know I can do it.\\" He did show that his desire and dreams about come back were strong and real...for his children, for us, for the purpose. He overstepped his physical pain and public humiliation.  He was ready to go.<br />It does show the creativity process and perfectionism of Michael' work on stage, his gentle and intelligent personality. You may like him or don't. But I belive everybody will learn about his message to the people: Love is important, Give your love back to the world, Love each other and our home-Earth, We are one, Make a change.<br />If you are going to see the movie, please, stay till the very end of \\"This Is It\\"- there is a beautiful surprise after the credits. You will see that Michael loves and cares about us. He will be back...on his own time...<br /><br />MJ is all about Love to the planet Earth and all it's creations.<br />I like his music. Now I listen his poem and think about how we make our own destiny. I can feel his pain...his innocence.<br />He can touch your soul with his lyrics. Personally, I do not like his \\"Thriller\\" era that was his blessing in a music industry and also a curse in his life.<br />I can relate to his more mature period.<br />\\"Black And White\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\",the inspiration behind \\"We Are The World\\", \\"Earth Song\\", \\"They do not care about us\\", \\"Speechless\\",etc.<br />He is a true Artist. He is a Human.<br /><br />They say:\\"He was famous because he was not normal\\" - this opinion is for the crowd. We all have two sides that are forever in conflict. But rare unique human as Michael Jackson with his philosophy of \\"Heal the World with Love\\" brings very strong moral message. His talent is able to touch the soul of people who are prepared to listen and open the mind of those who are able to think.<br />For me Michael is like a meteorite.<br />Burned out but left bright light...<br />There will never be like him again. Genius and Love is a very rare combination.<br /><br />Many years ago I read novel \\"The American tragedy\\". It does remind me the line of personal tragedy in the society that based on materialism and stereotypes.<br /><br />Allow yourself to know Michael Jackson in his deepest emotions.<br />So, listen his songs and poem \\"Planet Earth\\" and open your heart, feel it, make a change...<br />L.O.V.E.ut but left bright light...   There will never be like him again. Genius and Love is a very rare combination.    Many years ago I read novel \\"The American tragedy\\". It does remind me the line of personal tragedy in the society that based on materialism and stereotypes.    Allow yourself to know Michael Jackson in his deepest emotions.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|When this series came out back in 1994, i was just getting into high school and i have to say that what Winnie Holzman did with the writing of this series, really saved me and showed me that i was not alone. Her character's were so true to life that even today, 15 years after the show got cancelled, it still has an effect on people's lives. My mom bought this DVD series for me for my 30th birthday and i still love the show, it brings me back to when i had those thoughts that Angela felt and did those things that they did. Claire Danes' character Angela Chase, was very much me when i was in high school. I wore the flannel shirts, the combat boots and the jeans. And i even had friends like Rickie and Rayanne and had that huge crush on that unattainable guy like Jordan Catalano. The only disappointing feature in this DVD series is the fact that Jared Leto didn't come back to do any commentary or talk about his experience when he was on the show.   To this day, i wish that ABC could have at least gave MSCL a second season, because i would of liked to have seen through the eyes of Rayanne, Rickie, Sharon and Jordan more that what they showed from the first and only season.  I miss the 90's because even though i hated being a teenager, i miss what it was like to discover new things about yourself and feeling your first crush, that first puppy love that it's so strong you think you'll die, or that first really embarrassing zit or the first time you dyed your hair.   This series showed me that i have a voice and i can tell people what i really think and feel and it has made me the person i am today.  I would recommend this series to all teenagers who feel lost and think that no one understands them. Even though the clothing and the music has changed, the feelings are the things that have remained the same and to me that is the most important.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|David Foster could not have brought together such outstanding artists under one roof - how could I have missed that event.  Obviously the songs the artists sang had something to do with David's involvement so you are not going to hear something outside of that space; but the show was well done and very personal.  It is an excellent Blu-ray to own - the video and audio quality was worth it.  It is definitely a disc to see more than once.
0802130208|5.0|A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is decidedly a modern classic.  If you know New Orleans, it's like being there.  If you don't know New Orleans, you'll finally know what that corner of heaven is like!  Full of the best dunces on earth.
1400049628|5.0|This short book is a funny look into what it would really be like to be in a zombie infested world. This is a pretty good book but I also recommend Max Brooks' other book World War Z.
B0000009SF|5.0|As a long time Zappa fan,this album strangely has never come across my path. After reading the powerfully positive reviews here I just purchased it. Think of this as a more sophisticated and lush sounding Hot Rats. Buy it now!!!!!
0307346617|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I really enjoyed the writing style. I am a real fan of zombie novels and this is by far one of the best out there. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a good book.
0061730327|5.0|This book tells a compelling story of perseverance of a young man in Malawi who builds a windmill out of scrap parts to provide electricity for his family.  I was anxious to find out how he did this, but soon realized that his story of survival through famine and difficult economic times was an equally captivating story.  The moments of despair are enough to make you cry, but the moments of hope are so uplifting you can't put the book down.  The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is never preachy, but you can't help note the contrast between the world of depravity in Africa, and the world of excess in the West.   In his effort to promote progressive thinking in his community about issues such as the environment, AIDS, and technology, it is no wonder so many people have rallied behind William Kamkwamba to help him continue his education.  This has become one of my favorite books of the year.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I was surprised by the quality of the digital film transfer. If you haven´t seen this movie before, here´s an excellent opportunity to know it. This is not a regular sci-fi movie, and I think this is really what makes it unique in the genre.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|I wasnt at Woodstock, but i sure knew what was happening in the music world---wanted to be there but could only follow it in the papers and TV---this boxset has to be the Ultimate viewing material available to us to date. the quality is way better than past releases (especially VHS)extended scenes with the crowd makes you closer to what your watching, you can feel the vibes--all the bonus material especially the bands that didnt get included in the original release kept me excited as i got to view some of my favourite groups in action with the times---all in all, if you want a step back in time to view what you missed not being there and if you were there, a trip to your past--BUT THIS GREAT COLLECTORS EDITION WOODSTOCK 3 DAYS OF PEACE AND MUSIC
0312570740|5.0|This is very well researched and well written account. If you know anything about markets, trading, politics then you simply have to read this book. IT certainly allows you to draw your own conclusions about the man.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|When this movie came out the attitude around it was it was another superhero movie, but those who had read the graphic novel knew better (I was not one of these people).  After seeing the movie and then reading the book afterward I realized why this was such a groundbreaking show that surprisingly moves with the book.  Overall it's a movie that should not be presented to young children without the much tamer version of book form being seen first.  Even at that parents should decide if their children can handle some of the more graphic scenes in this cinematic and cultural ride.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I always enjoy listing to Michael Buble and this is no exception.  I expect to hear some great covers and this album provides that - I particularly enjoyed \\"Cry Me a River\\" - it was a new take on the song - the intro to the song is great and is not at all what I expected.  His voice as always is smooth and reminiscent of past greats.  However, I really enjoyed his two new songs as well.  \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is an upbeat, fun song that you can't help but sing along with and feel happy when hearing it.  Overall, this new album is a great addition to Buble's work, providing a great mix of old and new, and hits the mark.
0385504225|3.0|THe book started off at a brisk pace and kept me totally interested. Somewhere along the way it got too convoluted and went off in all directions until you were almost dizzy. It became too bizarre , especially the weird tatooed protagonist. Enough is enough, Mr. Brown.
0882709194|5.0|Great book from Ray Comfort. It's always nice and refreshing to see someone like Ray boldly present facts instead of the usual, emotion-based vitriolic that poses Darwin as \\"proven by science\\" when, in fact, Darwin is simply an unsupported tenet of the religion of Scientism.    This book reveals how Darwinism is hardly proven by science, but is a crutch for those who want to justify living how they want even when their conscience tells them there is a God, and they will someday be accountable to Him!    Nice work Ray.
B0017HEYEI|3.0|I was happy to be able to by a DVD not a Blue-Ray. The only problem with this import was it was all in Korean including the menues. You have to use your intuitive skills of menues, since you are reading Korean or unless you know Korean, to swith the language to English and turn off the subtitles. It wasn't that dificult. We do have to do it everytime we play the disk. But movie plays well and is of good quality.
0882709194|5.0|Despite claims to the contrary Ray Comfort has in no way changed any portion of the original text that Darwin penned. He has merely appended a clearly identifiable preface to the text which offers up alternative viewpoints. Darwin has enjoyed an essentially unchallenged position in our public school systems for well over 50 years. Yet a large number of graduates are still not convinced.<br /><br />Now, when an attempt to propose possible alternatives to Darwin's theories is made, the evolutionary crowd like ravening dogs begin to howl. Rather than being a well-reasoned, open-minded, scientific group that encourages free thought they seek to silence their only opposition.<br /><br />Perhaps this is due to frustration arising from failing to prove their own theories after these many years or maybe it's related to Darwin's misgivings about his own work. Whatever the cause it is rather interesting to see such an abject hatred on the part of these scientific minds.
0385504225|2.0|There are some very long reviews here, but I will try to keep this simple.  The premise of the book is based on a very New Age Philosophy that the reader and main character have trouble believing.  The story relies on too many coincidences and \\"Oh I just realized/remembered\\" to be believable.  One of the major plot points is based on a character not sharing information until late in the book that they very easily could have shared at the beginning and had no reason not to.<br /><br />Ultimately this reads more like National Treasure than The Da Vinci Code except without the humor.
B001684L0A|4.0|This is a first class movie in its own right.  I did not give it 5 stars only because nothing is perfect.  There seems to have been a lot of emphasis on historical accuracy, that and the cinematography transports you back to 1776.  The acting is wonderful as the characters seem three dimensional.  This is not for the pre-teen folks as the cruelty of life is not whitewashed. Every citizen should watch this! (Also loved the pop up history facts.)
B0019X3YXM|4.0|A very warm and enigmatic romantic comedy that magically explores issues of destiny in love, grief and healing from having lost a partner you loved dearly. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Doesn't quite match the crisp songs and exhilarating guitar sounds a la Soundgarden or Smashing Pumpkins. OK Computer and In Rainbows are classic like an \\"A\\", but I can only give \\"Half to Thief\\" a B- at best. Maybe if I'm just completing my collection, but not as essential as the others.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|Anyone who saw Michael Jackson's This Is It will agree that it was a spectacular motion picture event.  Certainly, upon leaving the theater I know most people will want to relive the songs you heard in the film.  Thus, this quasi-soundtrack was released just for that purpose.  However, as great as the music is, this collection just seems like more of the same...and that's exactly what it is.  Without the visuals and new arrangements that you see in the film, this album is just flat.  As a 'greatest hits' package, it fails since previously released albums do a much better job of presenting Michael Jackson's musical legacy:  see HIStory, Number Ones, The Essential Collection.  The second disc of demos is a nice little touch, but anemic compared to what they could've done with this.  My suggestion is to buy the mp3 EP 'Selections from Michael Jackson's This Is It', which contains the two versions of \\"This Is It\\" and the contents of disc 2.  Chances are the most fans already own the songs on disc 1 many times over by now.
0547258305|5.0|Katsa is a Graceling. Her Grace is killing. She doesn't like to kill but the King makes her. When she meets Prince Po her world is about to drastically change. Can she be in love and still be herself?<br /><br />I don't usually like these pure fantasy novels. I'm more of an Urban Fantasy person. Kristin Cashore might have just changed my mind.<br />In Graceling Cashore has created a magical fantasy world full of surprises. She took a concept that has been done one million times-superpowers-and completely made it her own original work of art. The land in which Graceling takes place is full of endless possibilities.<br />Katsa is an strong female character. She has good reason to be. Katsa's growth as a character is amazing. It never felt rushed or unjustified. It takes some authors three to four books to achieve this much character development. Kristin did it in one book. She has a knack for it!<br />The relationship between Katsa and Po was of course my favorite part. I thought it played out perfectly. It wasn't overdone but it did leave you wanting more.<br /><br />Kristin Cashore is a name we are going to be hearing for a long time to come. She is a fairly new name on the YA Fantasy front but I think she will be right up there with Robin McKinley very soon. I loved Graceling and I can't wait for Fire. If you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for? 5 Stars!
0061719544|5.0|I was not a fan of Craig's until I read this book. His life has been a sad road to self-discovery, but through it all he seemed to have an inner sense to succeed. He is multi-talented and I think it is because he has so much to draw from in his own life. The hardships gave him the strength to plow through the most difficult of professions and come out a winner. Moreover, this book if anything is the testament to the \\"believe in yourself\\" motto, and now we believe in him.
0307269752|5.0|Fun books to read.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out in the States.  Couldn't put these books down once I picked them up.
0882709194|1.0|Ray Comfort doesn't even understand how bananas came to be the size, shape and color they are (they are a product of human selective breeding in agriculture).  The last thing we need is \\"Bananaman's\\" absurd take on Darwin's work.  If you want to read Darwin, read Darwin.  If you want to read Comfort...fine, gives the rest of us a laugh at your expense.
0307460444|5.0|I do not understand any of the negative reviews; perhaps unable to follow directions?  I absolutely love this cookbook (thanks Martha!).  This cookbook is worth the purchase price just for the frostings alone.  Of course, key to making the recipes work best is a (Kitchen Aid) stand mixer.  I made a variety of cupcakes for my step-daughter's birthday; a friend brought 18 cupcakes from Sprinkles.  At the end of the day, 12 Sprinkles cupcakes were left and none of the ones I made were left.  Favorite recipes (so far) are:    Red Velvet w/cream cheese frosting  Boston Cream Pie (I made these in the large muffin tin - gorgeous)  Peanut butter w/pb & jelly frosting (use natural p'butter)  Mint-filled brownie bits (I make mini's using Jr. Mints)    Cupcakes are the current \\"rage\\" at parties, gatherings, etc.  This cookbook is well thought out, inspirational and full of great ideas and -- most importantly -- the cupcakes are truly delicious.  I highly recommend this cookbook.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|The Lost Symbol reads as though it was written for a screenplay, and not the big screen, but a 30 minute television show.    Brown goes into great detail about the locations and how one gets from point A to point B, but does very little to build the characters in the novel.  His antagonist is a weak, insane sad case of a person, his protagonist is a puppet all through the novel, never taking a position on the white horse, but always being the pawn of other players.  The rolling of all of the events of the tale into a single night is incredulous.  The CIA Supervisor is a far less than believable character.    All in all, this was a disappointing follow up to the DaVinci Code.  It was a 30 minute story crammed into over 100 chapters of a book.
0385504225|5.0|It's no wonder it took Dan Brown so long to write this book.  The meticulous research, the finely woven story line along with a deep spiritual message work intricately together to produce his best book to date.  A definite re-read
0307472590|5.0|I've been reading only in English for 10 years now, so I was really looking forward to this novel.  It really went beyond all my expectations.  The narrative was splendid and the metaphors were really breath taking. I loved the life lessons that were dropped here and there, depictions of our reality, true jewels of life:    \\"El tiempo me ha enseñado a no perder las esperanzas, pero a no confiar demasiado en ellas.\\"     \\"Estamos dispuestos a creer cualquier cosa menos la verdad\\".    \\"El destino suele estar a la vuelta de la esquina. Como si fuese un chorizo, una furcia o un vendedor de lotería: sus tres encarnaciones más socorridas. Pero lo que no hace es visitas a domicilio. Hay que ir a por él.\\"    \\"La televisión amigo Daniel, es el Anticristo y le digo yo que bastarán tres o cuatro generaciones para que la gente ya no sepa tirarse pedos por su cuenta y el ser humano vuelva a la caverna, a la barbarie medieval, y a estados de imbecilidad que ya superó la babosa allá por el pleistoceno. Este mundo no se morirá de una bomba atómica como dicen los diarios, se morirá de risa, de banalidad, haciendo un chiste de todo, y además un chiste malo.\\"    \\"Las palabras con que se envenena el corazón de un hijo, por mezquindad o por ignorancia, se quedan enquistadas en la memoria y tarde o temprano le queman el alma.\\"    \\"A veces una se siente más libre de hablarle a un extraño que a la gente que conoce. ¿por qué será? Probablemente porque un extraño nos ve como somos; no como quiere creer que somos.\\"    \\"Hay pocas razones para decir la verdad, pero para mentir el número es infinito.\\"    \\"Los libros son espejos: sólo se ve en ellos lo que uno ya lleva dentro.\\"    \\"Ya tiene la vida suficientes verdugos para que uno vaya haciendo doblete y ejerciendo de Torquemada con uno mismo.\\"    \\"A veces nos creemos que las personas son décimos de lotería: que están ahí para hacer realidad nuestras ilusiones absurdas.\\"    \\"No hay segundas oportunidades, excepto para elremordimiento.\\"    \\"Las personas estamos dispuestas a creer cualquier cosa antes que la verdad.\\"    I can really keep going... It is really one of my favorites novels, I loved it!
0446560065|5.0|Totally enjoyed \\"Simon's Cat!\\"   Having shared our house with cats for many years ( [...] ) it is so very obvious that Tofield has experienced the quirks and wonders of these impressive furry friends as well - every cat purrrson should have a copy!  Enjoy!
B001GCUER0|2.0|In Season One, both Don Draper and Peggy Olson have a strong story arc.  We get to know Don better through his long-lost brother.  And we see Peggy rise from secretary to copywriter.  What do we get in Season Two?  Almost nothing.  Don is back to his old tricks and that's about it.  Oh...and he's against dropping the Mohawk Airlines account for the American Airlines account.  Really riveting stuff there.  And Peggy.  Now that she's a copywriter, it seems like the writers didn't know what to do with her during Season Two.  I guess the best you can say about her is that she gives free advice to the priest on public speaking.  Again--really riveting stuff there.  It seemed like Season Two focused more on the supporting characters, such as Sal, Ken and Paul.  But why spend so much time with the supportining characters and not enough time with the leads?  This was the problem with Season Two and one of the reasons why it was boring.  Not recommended.
1843560267|5.0|I have a copy of the [[ASIN:0226039331 A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd Edition]] for in-depth NT study, but there are times when I prefer the abridged Liddell and Scott: when I'm not in the mood to deal with heavy lifting (BDAG is bulky); when I want a non-NT perspective on a word; and from time to time I look at Classical texts that have vocabulary that's not included in the BDAG.  The larger text of this re-print is much appreciated too.  I usually frown on paperbacks and adhesive binding--but this is sturdy and makes for a good price.
B002ZNJWI6|5.0|The characters are good if not great, and the story is epic and amazingly imaginative. Great.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|tinto brass refused to have his name associated with it after seeing the final edit. there are some hard core scenes which were added after filming. the odd part about purchasing this movie was the store clerk who kept trying to persuade me not to buy the product. i told him that i purchased it for the historical significance and not for the porn. but it sure is nice to see helen when she was younger.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown can always impress me with his excellent writing skill.  This book is better than Angels and Demons
B00005RYKU|2.0|Though it seems to have come out in 02, cell phones don't exist here in a kind of crappy teen slasher pic. The 16 year old at the center is suspicious from the start, but most of the film is a build up to her worst fears coming true. The script is mediocre, so the tension isn't there and the evil guardians don't ring true either.
B002P7UCMC|3.0|Pretty good, I'll need to listen to it more to get into it but its a little more of the same as Rosenrot, got a few catchy songs but nothing that stands out, but like stated before, maybe I just need to listen to it a bit more, a lot has come out recently so I haven't had enough time to get a good listen to it all. The single \\"P*ssy\\" just sounds a bit basic in the vocal area for my liking.
0142403873|5.0|The other reviews say it all. This is an awesome book and my son loves to read it over and over. I recommend it to kids of all ages.
0307269981|4.0|I bought this as soon as I finished Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  I really enjoyed that book - the characters, the plot, the mystery.  It's the same characters, and I still enjoyed them.  But the ride was less enjoyable - to put it simply, it was just less interesting.  There was less of a mystery to be solved, and it ended somewhat predictably (although, so did Tattoo).  I still plan on reading the third in the series (Kicked the Hornets Nest), but while Tattoo was one of the most fun books I've read in a while, this was just good.  I'd recommend it to people who read Tattoo, but you don't need to rush out and read it.  Take a break from the characters - and the occasionally choppy English translation, and revisit this later.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown grasps the reader by the first chapter and does not let go until this enlightening and wild ride back into the mysterious past of American founding fathers and Masonry is finally concluded in his last chapter. It is for the skeptic, the believer, the conspiracy theorist, and for those who want to be entertained. One can not help but be in awe of Brown's research and literary genious. This story is sure to be one that will last and cause quite a stir. Read this book!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I put this in for my 3yr old the other day because even though he's a boy, everyone has seen the movie and must see it. IT's a classic after all.  Anyways, I had come into the kitchen to get started with supper and immediately after the moving got going, I could hear nothing but giggles and laughter.  My 3yr old was cracking up at the animals being silly.  He LOVED this movie to say the least and I'm so happy to be able to share a movie with him that I grew up watching.  I recommend it to all. And fellas, no matter whether you have  a boy or a girl, they will love it!!<br /><br />I'm getting a blu-ray player soon so I'll update with how that looks!
B00009RDG9|3.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones.  Benicio Del Toro's not bad.  Connie Nielsen looks great.  William Friedkin is a good director.  So what happened?  A more developed script would've helped. The Hunted boasts impressive knife fighting sequences - albeit mainly of Tommy vs. Benicio. Throughout the film, Tommy Lee looks wracked with guilt because of his past but doesn't do much about it. Meanwhile, Benicio plays the war scarred assassin with no way out.  That's pretty much the storyline as The Hunted combines chase sequences, Rambo First Blood forest scenarios and a one way ticket to the end.  There is a tremendous opportunity to up the psychological ante in the Hunted, but it never quite materialises.  Still, this is watchable especially if you're a Tommy Lee fan.
B000005DQR|5.0|Sampling really is a bad word to use here. White magic may be better.<br /><br />When you think of sampling, you think of taking a sound and insterting it into your music, not taking 100s per song, and creating entierly NEW music.<br /><br />The almost ambient work Shadow does here is increadible. Think of one of those plants at the bottom of the sea that constrantly shift, sway and rotate. That is Shadow's tracks do on Entroducing. On each listen, little micropoints of sound emerge, and the songs seem to change each time around.<br />If I say almost ambient, it is only because this music is loud enough to be the most agressive on the ambient scale, and many times ducks into a sound level way beyond what we would think of as ambient.<br /><br />Again, with the masters, genre labals become useless.<br /><br />Many of us have Shadow's disease--combing the shops, looking for that obscure record, that thing that you have been seeking since high school that pops into your hand when you are 35 and have forgotten or given up on.<br /><br />But the fact that Shadow can take our affliction and turn it into art, meticulous art, high art, is sweet revenge for us all. Not many would have even concieve of this, never mind have the talent or concentration to be able to make it work on this level.<br /><br />Found sounds, of course, have been part of music for years. But like the Beatles or the Stones or Steely Dan, there is that THING Shadow has. It is almost too otherworldy to deconstruct OR maybe we just don't want to, in fear of its losing its viceral charm: the music just seems more layered, more nuanced,  the cymbls seem to crack more crisp, the bass has that extra medloic kick at the end--it is like watching a Scorcessie film where the images seem more real than real.<br /><br />The fact that this real guy, who walks, talks,  dresses and thinks like us, is one of us, can do this with a bunch of records is just astounding, and makes me love this all the more.<br /><br />VIVA SHADOW!
B001GCUNW6|5.0|\\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" marks the third CG animated film for 20th Century Fox via Fox's CGI division Blue Sky Studios and the third \\"Ice Age\\" film directed by Carlos Saldanha (also directed \\"Robots\\" and \\"Gone Nutty\\").  The film is co-directed by Mike Thurmeier (\\"Horton Hears a Who\\", \\"Robots\\", \\"Gone Nutty\\") and a story by Jason Carter Eaton and a screenplay by Pete Ackerman, Michael Berg (both worked on previous \\"Ice Age\\" films), Yoni Brenner and Mike Reiss (\\"The Simpsons\\", The Critic\\", \\"It's Garry Shandling's Show\\").  Music is composed by John Powell (\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", \\"United 93\\", \\"Kung Fu Panda\\").<br /><br />Back in 2002, the original \\"Ice Age\\" film focused on the friendship between creatures Manny the woolly mammoth (voice over by Ray Romano, \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\"), Sid the weird looking, not-so-bright and clumsy ground sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo, \\"ER\\", \\"Miracle at St. Anna\\", \\"Titan A.E.\\") and the saber-toothed tiger (aka smilodon) named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary, \\"Rescue Me\\").  Also, seen outside of the main core of the group is side-story featuring a squirrel known as Scrat who has a passion towards acorns.<br /><br />With the first film focusing on the migration to avoid the Ice Age and the main character's friendship, the second film \\"Ice Age: The Meltdown\\" (2006) features the melting of the ice and focuses on Manny finding another woolly mammoth named Ellie (voice by Queen Latifah, \\"Mad Money\\", \\"Chicago\\").<br /><br />This time around for the third film \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\", Ellie is now pregnant and is soon to give birth.  Being the worried and concerned father, Manny is highly anticipating the birth of his child and each kick, he often accidentally tells the whole herd that Ellie is about to give birth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his friends are not in a better place. Diego is getting older and feels that he is not the agile fighter as he once was as he now gets dizzy and can't even chase after his prey like he once used to. So, Diego feels as if he has to leave home. Sid feels alone now that his best friend has other responsibilities.  As for the nutty squirrel known as Scrat, upon discovering his beloved acorn, he becomes smitten with a female squirrel named Scratte who is also passionate for the acorn.<br /><br />Manny creates a playground for his upcoming child and surprises Ellie with it.  Meanwhile, Sid feeling that he has no one ends up falling through a hole and discovering three eggs.  Wanting to be a parent himself, he brings the three eggs to the village.  Because of the size, Manny tells Sid to return the eggs back to its mother but Sid of course has other plans.  Not wanting to be alone, he ends up sleeping with the eggs and when hatched, three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex's come out and Sid becomes the designated \\"mother\\" for the three which he names Eggbert, Shelly and Yoko.<br /><br />Excited about being a parent, he tries to introduce to his new children to his friends but instead brings the three to Manny's playground (which was supposed to be for Manny and Ellie's child).  The kids of the village then join in on the fun and because of the Tyrannosaurus Rex's nature, they begin to roughhouse the children and end up swallowing a few of them.  Also, in the process...the three young dinosaurs end up destroying the playground.<br /><br />Manny and Ellie arrive to find the destruction and Manny is upset that Sid didn't listen to him and now the playground he built is destroyed.  To make things worse, the true mother of the three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex now wants her children back and leads the huge dinosaur right into their village.<br /><br />The Tyrannosaurus Rex ends up getting her children back but with Sid not willing to give up the children, he is taken as well by the dinosaur.<br /><br />Now Manny, Ellie, Diego along with the two weasels Crash (voiced by Seann William Scott, \\"American Pie\\" films) and Eddie (Josh Peck, \\"Drake & Josh\\", \\"The Wackness\\") end up going after the dinosaur to find Sid and find themselves away from the ice and into a new land where there is no snow and dinosaurs exist.  Not knowing how to survive around the dangerous dinosaurs, they run into a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg, \\"Hot Fuzz\\", \\"Sean of the Dead\\", \\"Star Trek\\") who knows his way around the area.<br /><br />So, the group try to survive the dangerous dinosaurs, tough terrain but most importantly trying to be careful for the nastiest dinosaur of them all...Rudy.<br /><br />\\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" on Blu-ray comes with three discs.  The original Blu-ray is accompanied with the movie on DVD and also a digital copy.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1, AVC@36 MBPS), I'm always impressed to see how hair/fur continues to look better and better via CG and the sheer detail found in each character and its surroundings are much more evident now than ever.  In fact, this is probably the most vibrant \\"Ice Age\\" film due to the fact that the film is taken outside of its ice habitat and into the land of the dinosaurs where there is a lot of lush plant life, sunlight, etc.  Overall, CG animated fans will love the picture quality of this film.  Sky Blue Studios did a fantastic job!<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital) and as fantastic as the picture quality was, the audio quality is just as magnificent.  Talk about an immersive soundtrack, dinosaur growls all around you and how its utilized through the surround and rear surround channels are nicely done. Front and center channels feature the dialogue and the music which are crystal clear.  Also, good use of LFE during the action sequences.<br /><br />Both video and audio quality for \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaur\\" receive high marks!  Fans of the film will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio commentary - A commentary featuring Director Carlos Saldanha,  co-director Michael Thurmeier, producer Lori Forte, John C.

In fact, if you are a big fan of the character of Scrat, you are definitely going to enjoy this film!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" is the best film of the series yet and an exciting and hilarious CG animated film to own on Blu-ray.

B000M341RI|5.0|In the spirit of full disclosure, most of the films and literature on my \\"all-time favorite\\" lists are British, so there is definitely something about our cousins across The Pond that appeal to my sensibilities, although I am not of British descent, but \\"Monty\\" is special. Being from the Missouri Ozarks, the Yorkshire accents in the movie couldn't be further from what my ears are accustomed to hearing, but in no way did that interfere with my thorough enjoyment of this film. It is warm, sweet, a bit melancholy, and touching while managing to avoid being sappy...and absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />The key is the situations in which the characters find themselves that are funny and not so much the characters themselves.  The result is believability and dignity of each character, even while they find themselves in very undignified circumstances.<br /><br />As a side note, The \\"translator\\" section in the Special Features is puzzling to me because they translate slang terms with which most Americans are already familiar, i.e., \\"DIY,\\" \\"tw-t,\\" etc., but leave out British oddities that are unknown in the USA, such as \\"chuffing Nora\\" \\"kit,\\" and \\"taking the piss\\" and some terms that, after repeated viewings, still sound like gobbledygook to the average American.  No matter. Everyone I know who has seen the film understood what was going on.<br /><br />This film is not raunchy, tacky, or vulgar, so do not let the premise put you off.  It is a lovely story about human beings discovering their dignity in the midst of very undignified circumstances.  Highly, highly recommended.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|About fifteen years ago I walked into the teachers' room at a school where I was working overseas. A coworker was playing the Beatles' \\"Drive My Car,\\" and after about ten seconds I stopped what I was doing and stared at the boombox in the corner. Something sounded different. Something sounded very different... and really really good. My coworker looked up at me and said, \\"What... what's the problem?\\" So I asked him, \\"Did you by any chance tape that off a record?\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he said, \\"I taped it off of one of my dad's old singles. Why?\\"<br /><br />\\"Because it's in mono.\\"<br /><br />He paused to listen for a moment, then just stared at me and shrugged his shoulders. I never told him how much better it sounded because he probably didn't believe me in the first place. But I use that story to make a point: If you love something and know it well, the differences are obvious.<br /><br />I've waited a long time for these on CD... over twenty years, in fact. I suppose my search started right around the time I found out that mono pressings even existed. I had looked for them for years on cd but didn't have much luck til about ten years ago. The Dr. Ebbets' mono CDs helped as a stop-gap... heck, that's all we had a for a long time... that is, other than compressed, phony \\"monos\\" you would sometimes find on eBay, but even then the Ebbet's stuff were ultimately vinyl tranfers, taken from the Japanese red wax monos.<br /><br />This box set comes from the master tapes themselves. These are the real deal.<br />And the sound quality is incredibly rich, more so than anything heard from the eighties releases.<br /><br />Now people are going to ask what the big deal deal is all about. Most fans would not get all that excited about shelling out another $[...] bucks for a set of recordings they believe they already own. True, the differences between the stereo and mono version are subtle, but to the faithful they are anything but.<br /><br />Some basic facts to know about these mono recordings. George Martin and the Beatles were personally involved in the mixing of the mono recordings, making their overall sound as true to the original intent as anything we have. Some vocals are more prominent, harmonies are coalesced (a very big factor in mono/stereo difference), certain instruments and/or sound effects are more or less evident, the drums come through more clearly on many tracks, some songs are a little slower or faster (Lucy in The Sky - slower, She's Leaving Home - faster), and some tracks are shorter all together (Helter Skelter - loses the fade in at the end - a mistake on the part of the mixing crew, actually.  The list is pretty long and varied, so I won't go into it too deeply, but Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, and The White Album are good starting points for such exploration.<br /><br />Now once the Beatles finished mixing the Mono recordings, they left it to engineers to attend to the stereo mixes, mixes that often sound a bit different. Now, don't get me wrong; many of us, myself included, were brought up on the stereo versions released on cd in the late eighties. They're wonderful recordings, because, ultimately, music is music... but again, they don't exactly represent what the Beatles wanted as the final product.<br /><br />Lennon himself once said, \\"You haven't really heard Sgt.

1881273628|5.0|I was skeptical of this book, but a friend recommended it to me, so I read it. I was very surprised at all that it taught me. While at times some of the stories used to illustrate the theory get a bit tedious, I could clearly see that the philosophy behind it was right on target. I can really see what my language(s) is and how valuble a tool this is for nurturing relationships.
B001PPLJJ0|1.0|I've read the book and seen the movie and while the movie is less tendentious and historically false than the book, it has serious moral problems as one reviewer notes.  By sexualizing Kate Winslett and making her vulnerable through her nudity, it pushes us to both sympathize and eroticize her character, judging her despicable behavior much more difficult.  But make no mistake: she was not powerless despite the movie's shameful attempt to make us believe she was. Nor is her \\"secret\\" remotely believable in the context of the times.  I've reviewed the movie elsewhere, and am very sorry that so many viewers and reviewers think this is a profound treatment of the Holocaust or the human condition or anything at all:    [...]    The greatest irony of all is that Kate Winslett, playing a foul-mouthed actress on \\"Extras,\\" said that the only way to get an Oscar was to play a \\"cripple\\" or be in a Holocaust movie.  The writers of \\"Extras\\" certainly got that one right.

0316036692|5.0|I just finished Outliers, and I really enjoyed it. Gladwell's insights into the everyday things we take for granted are not only interesting and entertaining, but informative. I can't wait to read his next work.
0446401307|4.0|The Overlook seems to have gotten mixed reviews but I think its baggage of being originally a newspaper story released in parts (the novel was expanded and deepened a bit) has made fans go into it with the idea that they wouldn't like it. No, it's not the strongest in the series but its pretty exciting in that it's a mystery that's solved in pretty close to a day. The story, involving terrorism, feels very contemporary, and the mystery's ending is pretty surprising, if a little bit unbelievable.     It's an exciting entry in the series and while probably not the best place to start the series it's fun to see Bosch in a story that's more fast-paced and thrilling than usual.
B002P6TA94|5.0|WOW, not sure how this record was gonna be. Loved the self titled for what it was, lumped in with the rest of the retro rockers when it came out, kinda same old same old but there were some good songs, but DAMN this record kicks A$$! so many great tracks. real maturity and POWER to these songs sorley lacking in today's modern rock. If you love 70's rock with a bit of a modern edge....you will love this record. Get the deluxe version, the extra tracks are worth it. you won't be sorry! finally a real ROCK record that has the balance of hard rockers and mellow yet powerful ballads that swirl and uplift. Give this a whirl and expand your mind..Rhianna won't mind kiddies.

B002LVVCIK|3.0|Once again, Michael Moore has made a film which entertains and moves us, while making us think about important issues. And he deserves praise for highlighting the perversions and inequities in our system.  Unfortunately, his scapegoating of the entire free enterprise system and his proposed solution of \\"Democracy\\" do not rise above the level of demagoguery.<br /><br />Like his other movies, \\"Capitalism\\" is not so much a documentary as it is a propaganda piece masquerading as a documentary.  In its zeal to make a point, the film rambles through a series of emotional anecdotes and provocative scenes.  It is at best incomplete and at worst incorrect in its analysis and conclusions.  Moore clearly knows little about what true capitalism is or should be, but it makes a convenient scapegoat for things he doesn't like in our society.<br /><br />While watching the film, I kept thinking of the commonly misquoted expression \\"Money is the root of all evil\\".  But the true quote is \\"The LOVE of money is the root of all evil.\\"  It's a distinction that many, including Mr. Moore miss.  The thesis of this film is that Capitalism equates to Greed which leads to the repression of the poor by the rich and is therefore Evil.  But the examples the film gives us are actually the result of the corruption of the system rather than the system itself.<br /><br />The ideal of capitalism is not greed, but rather enlightened self-interest.  Greed is the perversion of that self-interest and it often leads to corruption.  And it is the results of that corruption that Moore rails against and that we should be justifiably angry about.  For example, it's hard to disagree with Moore that it is unconscionable that banks that receive billions in taxpayer bailouts should be foreclosing on homes that they sold toxic loans to.  But this is not the fault of capitalism, but rather the result of the system derailed through excessive corporate greed, power and government corruption.<br /><br />In a true capitalist system, government's role is to ensure fair competition and open markets where individuals and firms acting freely and in their own self-interest lead to results that produce the most efficient allocation of resources, or \\"the greatest good for the greatest number\\".  And indeed capitalist systems have produced societies with unsurpassed standards of living.  The problem is that the system tends to get corrupted, in one of two ways.<br /><br />In the first way, the one so well illustrated in this film, \\"winners\\" amass enough wealth and power to be able to control and corrupt the system designed to keep them in check.  This can lead to lead a backlash, which this film advocates, and the second type of corruption of the capitalist system, the seizing of resources from the rich and redistribution of wealth.  Moore euphemistically refers to this \\"solution\\" as \\"Democracy\\", but it is really his version of socialism.<br /><br />For me, the biggest irony of the film is that while the atrocities it details are not really examples of capitalism so much as it's corruption, the film itself is a wonderful example of the benefits of capitalism.  Moore, a man from humble origins, has been able to apply his talents and hard work to create a film which others choose to produce and distribute, and we choose to pay to see.  To the extent the film succeeds, the marketplace rewards Moore, giving him the resources to produce more films and distribute them more widely.  As a society we are better off as a result.  And in that sense, the film's success is the best argument against it's anti-capitalist message.'s role is to ensure fair competition and open markets where individuals and firms acting freely and in their own self-interest lead to results that produce the most efficient allocation of resources, or \\"the greatest good for the greatest number\\".

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I was astounding by the detail of information and the graphic of the video.  This is a video that every family should have in their family.  My family really enjoy this video.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Props to Kenny Ortega and the editing team for a really well constructed movie, made in a fraction of the time a feature normally takes to produce.  Nothing about this movie seemed \\"thrown together\\" or rushed.  It's a neat homage, concert film and documentary rolled into one.  An unintentional work of art, as the footage was never meant to see daylight.  Much better than I expected, and very moving in spots.  (Those who stay through the end of the credits will be rewarded with additional small treats.)      No question in my mind, this would have been the live show to end all shows.  It's almost difficult to comprehend so many mind-blowing production numbers in one two-hour concert.  MJ said in an interview that his intention was for fans to leave the shows unable to sleep all night, needing to stay up 'til dawn to talk about the experience with their friends, and I believe he would have achieved that.  He had many fresh ideas for what are now considered his classic works.  \\"Smooth Criminal\\" has never been a favorite of mine, but I liked it here a great deal.  After seeing this movie, I believe that Michael would have not only made it through all fifty shows at the O2, but would have been absolutely smashing, wowed his kids and his fans, and achieved the comeback and respect he so strongly desired.  As one reviewer noted, Michael Jackson wasn't about to just phone this one in for a payday, despite what some detractors have suggested.  In the collected footage we're privy to here, Michael looked to be in astonishingly good form as a singer and dancer considering he hadn't toured in over a decade.  If he was \\"frail\\" or otherwise compromised, there is no evidence of that here. Work obviously brought out the best in the man.    I would have liked a touch more of MJ speaking/instructing/interacting; it could have been a little longer of a film to accomplish that.  No one would have been fidgeting in their seats if the movie was 2:15 instead of 1:48.  To me, those were some of the best moments, a rare treat to see a master craftsman in unself-conscious work mode, oblivious to the cameras.  So one hopes that there will be lots of special features on a blu-ray edition (the whole videos, maybe?  More interviews with the dancers/crew/band?  More outtakes of MJ just being himself?) But a terrific film, a must-see for any Jackson fan, not only the die-hards. When this comes out in Blu-Ray, it will be in my library.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Being a fan of the whole Saga, I could not miss out this soundtrack in the first place. The soundtrack for the Twilight movie was really one of the best ones I've heard in a long time, and being a huge film buff I've heard tons of them, believe me.<br />As we all Twilighters know, the movie will be out in November, so I couldn't really say how will the music fit in the story. This soundtrack has a particular vibe to it, it's very different than the first one for sure. What I like most about it is the fact that Thom Yorke actually wrote a song for this album, which is absolutely amazing to have an artist in his range. The rest of the songs are pretty good, and the mood varies from very dark to happiness and love (which is kind of obvious, since we all know the story!). I must add that Muse contributed to this soundtrack with the song \\"I Belong To You\\" (which you can find on their latest album \\"The Resistance\\" but in a slightly different version with the second part sung in French), and I cannot wait to see the movie to see in which scene will we hear the song! There are some bands that have really surprised me with their song writing, because I wasn't a big fan before this album. One of such bands are The Killers. I wasn't a fan before hearing their song \\"A White Demon Love Song\\", it's very emotional and meaningful to the New Moon storyline. Also, I want to mention \\"Shooting The Moon\\" by OK Go, which is a brilliant song, especially the instrumental in the end!<br />Even though this soundtrack has a different sound than the first one, I rate it 5 stars. It really grows on you when you listen to it more than once, it has something special and meaningful for the New Moon plot. If you're asking about the genre, I describe it as pop/rock, alternative and indie. It's a good combination, trust me.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I can't find anyone who doesn't love THE BIG BANG THEORY.  For some, it is a guilty pleasure; for others it is simply the best show on television.  For whatever the reason, this surprise hit show connects with everyone.  And even more amazing, Season 2 is even better than Season 1.<br /><br />The premise of THE BIG BANG THEORY is still fresh, fun, and ever evolving: two young, genius, nerdy, socially awkward science professors named Sheldon and Leonard share an apartment. Across the hall, in moves Penny - a sweet, beautiful, blond bombshell who waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory.  Sheldon is wonderfully brilliant and \\"waaay out there;\\" he has no idea how to connect with the rest of the human race.  Leonard, a brilliant, comic book loving, super-hero pj wearing, sci-fi worshiping genius helps guide Sheldon through intricacies of human interaction, while falling in love with Penny.  And Penny keeps them both real, grounded, and somewhere in the vicinity of planet Earth.  As their friendships develop and grow, THE BIG BANG THEORY just gets better and better.<br /><br />It continues to be a phenomenon how unbelievably funny THE BIG BANG THEORY is. The writing over two seasons is smart, creative, and consistent. Somehow, the characterizations are masterful and avoid being over the top, and each character continues to grow and develop. The acting and comic timing are always inspired. This cohesive ensemble cast continues jell and the relationships deepen, and this talented cast just keeps surpassing all expectation.  There are so few shows that have ever given me a belly laugh in every episode; THE BIG BANG THEORY is definitely a member of the elite group, and is, in fact, leading the pack.  Clearly everyone involved in this effort cares for the show and for each other, and that is what makes THE BIG BANG THEORY work so well.<br /><br />Several favorite and beloved episodes have come out of THE BIG BANG THEORY's 2nd season, with my personal favorite being the Christmas episode, entitled \\"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis.\\" In this episode, Penny gives a truly thoughtful gift, without realizing exactly how thoughtful it is.  Another favorite in my family is the \\"The Lizard-Spock Expansion,\\" where we first learn of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.  There are many other favorites, but these two particularly stand out.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Big Bang, give it a try. Your sides will ache from laughing so hard. And personally, I still think the theme, sung by Bare Naked Ladies, is the best theme song on television.  It makes my feet do a happy dance every time.Bath Item Gift Hypothesis.\\" In this episode, Penny gives a truly thoughtful gift, without realizing exactly how thoughtful it is.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|If this had come out 20-30 years ago, Jet would have gone down as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.  Times and tastes have changed but that does not take away from the music on this CD being as great as it is.  The album is lined cover to cover with awesome songs.  Unlike a lot of bands these days that release only one or two good songs while the rest are garbage, Jet has put a lot of work into the entire album with each song having merits.  The songs for the most part are rocking upbeat and fun.  I love to blast this CD in my car while cruising down the road.     Keep an eye on this group and check out their other work too as Jet flat out rocks!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the 30 day shred after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say it is fantastic!  I workout at a gym probably 4-5 days a week with cardio and decided I needed to start with some strength training.  I did this video for the first time yesterday and I can feel the burn today.  I felt like 1 circuit is not really enough though but great if your short on time.  I did circuit 1 with 5 lb. weights and then did circuit 2 with 3 lb. weights and it was a perfect workout for about 40 minutes and I torched 512 calories per my heart rate monitor which is about what I get in a 50 minute jog (I am slow but still)  buy this you will love it!!
0307269981|5.0|This is the second book of Lawsson's trilogy.  It is about how the main character becomes the way she is.  It is a must read because the third book won't make as much sense.  I am sorry that the author has died because he is an excellent writer.
B001KEGRC0|2.0|I presumed the video, \\"Grand Canyon Adventure\\", to be an adventure-based, scenic video tour of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. Having never been there, I had hoped to \\"tour\\" the Canyon vicariously via this BD offering.    Sadly, it was nothing of the sort, being instead an environmentalist's message about dwindling water levels of the river itself. This was the theme of the entire video... a message about choices of water usage.     While there were several very nice shots of parts of the canyon, they were presented with a message, which detracted from the desired 'adventure' theme. I guess I should have been a more critical reader of the reviews before purchasing the video.    In conclusion, if you are interested in viewing/learning of opinions about the current \\"health\\" of the river, i.e. water levels and flow, then this video may be just right for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a nicely done tour of the canyon or of the river, as I was, then you'll want to look elsewhere.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I just had to include a review of the movie \\"This is it\\" for all the fans... have not listened to the soundtrack so please forgive me..    When the movie came on and we heard Michael' voice... the crowded theater became hushed and completely silent... \\"This is It\\" will move you, thrill you, make you laugh, shed a tear...     The creative genius of Michael Jackson is evident from the way he \\"feels the moment\\" \\"... he teaches the musicians to let the music \\"simmer\\"... so interestly put;... but that's Michael..    He gently makes a point but is always in control of how the choregraphy should be executed and deftly demonstrates what he feels inside.. the moves are fluid and instinctive.     He is not content to rest on his past laurels... Watch \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and be mesmerized by the innovative blend of vintage movies with the seamless present.day.. and Michael acting as a gangster (WOW) ... sexy man...    Finally, the humilty of this legendary icon... he is a perfectionist and works so hard... insists on the best from everyone from dancers, musicians, singers, producers.. when he makes a constructive criticism, it is wonderful to see how fitting his input is.. You find yourself saying ... \\"of course\\"..     He encourages those around him to give their very best.. you will hear many \\"God bless you\\" when some one does something that pleases him in rehearsal...     \\"This is it\\" says it all... experience it... You will appreciate Michael Jackson as never before..
B001AVCFK6|2.0|I came to watch this movie with great expectation and came away with a headache. I rate this movie a 5 overall---it is no match when compared to the original--it was interesting but the actors really did not excite me---see it after you drink a six pac and smoke weed then it may make overall sense to you.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|I will first start out with saying that I was just turning a mere four years young when this album first debuted in Oct. of 1984, but even then the classic song 'The Unforgettable Fire' resonated through my head, capturing me in its swirling carnival of colors. It would in fact define what I considered 80's music, which is, in a sense, what the Unforgettable Fire is for U2, their most 80's sounding album. It wasn't until much later (2001 to be exact) that I knew whom it was this song belonged to, that I've since have been trying to emulate with my own music.<br /><br />With U2's previous works they had shaped their sound, dynamics, and stage shows. As one can hear on the later half of the war album (excluding 40, a most beautiful song), however, this sound was becoming limited, and unable to quench the thirst of U2's ever yearning growth. It seemed in fact they couldn't- or shouldn't- sing that song again. In order to explore new sonic arenas they turned to Brian Eno, who brought along his good friend and fellow co-worker Daniel Lanois (both of whom's workings I was aware of long before I was of U2). Through them, and the absence of the dreary studio environment, ideas began to form, and songs became more than songs, but landscapes of sounds, or soundscapes. Orderliness was juxtaposed with random, raw, emotional, gut driven playing and singing.<br /><br />What we got from that is the Unforgettable Fire. A mix of pure pop genius, architectured poetry of both music and words, and the feeling of suspended free fall. Most of this is endured by Eno's love for flawed, raw takes, and in-completed ideas. So much so that the most popular song, and radio friendly of the bunch, 'Pride', sounds almost out of placed with its well crafted sound. This is not to say there was no deliberateness on U2s part. If this new remastering does anything, it brings out the wonderfully crafted sound that U2 brings to the album. This in no way sounds like a band with whom in 83 (a year and 8 months earlier), put out the raw sound of rock/punk that was War. Maybe it wouldn't be their most well crafted of attempts to refurbish themselves, but it would definitely lay the ground works for future endeavors such as The Joshua Tree (the newly re-hashed 'Disappearing Act' (featured on the bonus audio CD) is fairly safe to say the start of what would become 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking For'), Achtung Baby and even their newest No Line On the Horizon, which touches upon the Unforgettable Fire regularly (ie Fez-Being Born).<br /><br />So is it worth revisiting this album, in which would corner stone U2's career? (Live Aid would have meant nothing if 'Bad' had not been written.) The answer is an unquestionable yes. This newly remastered album brings to life the layers of sound interwoven amongst the cinematic pictures that these songs create. The bonus material is great, and it's wonderful to see the small barren stages of U2's earlier career, and thus putting more importance on the songs and the performances to sell the audience. It is also wonderful to see the 80's style they paraded, and to have some music videos from the era, as it is still beyond me why the 1980-1990 collection of videos has yet to be put on DVD.<br /><br />So a five star rating to the album that, to me, defined the 80's, and in a 'leap', defined the career of what we now know U2 is, simply unforgettable!put out the raw sound of rock/punk that was War.

B001HYX3IY|3.0|There are sections in this book which are thought provoking and interesting to listen to. There are other sections in this book which are far far too drawn out. The author has extensive experience in New Guinea and Indonesia, and talks at great length about them, focusing more on these islands than any continents in the world. If only Jared Diamond would condense his fascinating information, without needlessly listing out every single detail for hours on end on things like Asiatic languages and what types of crops can be found where, this book would be outstanding. As is, it is very difficult to pay attention and that is because some areas are so terrible boring, you wouldn't want to. However, if you can make it through the long unnecessary drawn out parts, the interesting parts are well worth it and eye opening. If anyone knows why some nations advanced ahead others, it is Jared Diamond.
0385504225|1.0|An author can get away with a limping writing style if he can back it up with good pacing and a strong story, but Brown offered neither in this book.      A substantial portion of the story is told in flashbacks, most of which are inserted into the middle of current action, effectively killing all forward motion and suspense.  I have never seen so many flashbacks in so few pages.  All current action was bookended by flashbacks, causing me to see clearly why flashbacks are avoided as much as possible by more savvy writers. Critical suspense scenes, death scenes and violent struggles are not the place for a character to take a two page trip down memory lane and review some old conversation they had with so-and-so that might or might not have some tangential relevance to their crisis of the moment.      As another suspense killer, characters were prone to wander off into plodding intellectual discussions about the more esoteric meanings of some whatchamacallit or other--without seeming to have any sense of the urgency they were supposed to be feeling.  Some revelations were necessary, but I kept expecting them to sit down and have themselves a cup of tea while they pondered the mysteries of the universe, regardless of the axe poised over their heads by the plot. I got the impression that Brown got so excited about the subject he'd introduced that he lost all track of his own plot.    To further stymie forward motion in the plot, Brown recaps at the beginning of nearly every chapter, like a television series that replays events from the past episode before beginning the current episode.  This was especially annoying because the chapters were so short that it created an ongoing sensation of taking two steps forward and one step back.  Either this was filler or Brown thought most of his readers would be putting the book down for a week between chapters.  Maybe they do...  it certainly drags enough to encourage that.      As for Langdon...  He sounds like a stuck record.Brown doesn't seem to think that he can stress it strongly enough that Robert Langdon absolutely, positively and and even downright categorically refuses to buy into any mystical mumbo-jumbo.  The redundancy is so extreme that Langdon becomes nothing more than the voice of the skeptical masses so that Brown can spout off with his rebuttal in the form of more enlightened characters.  Langdon becomes more plot device than hero.    The net impression this book left me with was that its primary purpose was to provide an excuse for Brown to pontificate about his beliefs and preen.  It was not a worthy read.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|What can I possibly add besides what has already been written?  I imagine only my perspective but here it is:<br /><br />I thought this movie felt like a poorly written overblown knock off of many films, including Far and Away.  It seemed to me that Nicole Kidman was trying to recapture some aspects of her character in Far and Away.  She failed miserably, in my opinion.  In fact, I believe that despite her natural talent, she missed the mark entirely in this movie.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman IS an excellent actor but he was sadly too silent in this film.  In my opinion, this hurt the movie as well as his credibility as an actor to allow Nicole Kidman or even the Half Caste boy to overshadow him.  While Nicole Kidman seems to be scrambling to recapture her lost past or better days, Hugh Jackman seemed to be gagged.  I have to wonder if this was written into his character because he was starring opposite Nicole Kidman or if the writers just didn't know what to do with such a versatile actor?<br /><br />The story?  I felt as though I was being preached at.  As though I were a half caste boy being dragged away to the \\"lock lock,\\" I was being sermonized for almost three hours about how evil certain ethnic groups are.  If the mission's job was to \\"breed the black out of them\\" as the minister said to Nicole Kidman, then this movie seemed to have a very political agenda to breed any free thought out of its viewers.<br /><br />Before you say, \\"Racist!!!\\" and cover your eyes and ears, I would say that one of the best (and most underspoken and underwritten) characters was Hugh Jackman's brother-in-law.  The actor playing him had one really great dialogue on the island \\"lock lock\\" that stuck with me long after the tripe Nicole Kidman has since past from my system (thankfully).<br /><br />If the goal of this movie was to let people know how bad things were for the aboriginal people of Darwin, Australia, then they failed for the most part.  It was too sedate and too unconvincing.  Ivan saying, \\"No Boongs!\\" but then letting the brother-in-law in (I wish I could remember his name; sorry) to have a drink actually came off flat.  If Ivan had remained adamant that no aborigine could come in, even in the midst of their impending deaths, THAT would have really said something to us all about how straight-jacket-like were the caste restrictions and ethnic bigotry.<br /><br />In all, the movie was so overblown that one rightfully expected \\"the wet\\" to come.  But it never did.  This movie was flat and failed to do anything but show that even with top notch actors, a big budget and all the trimmings including a plethora of good material,  it can fail to deliver anything but sub-standard dreck.

0321543726|1.0|Written with not much of a target audience.  Beginners will enjoy Walter Savitch's Problem Solving with C++, and people with more background should read Accelerated C++.    Please be wary with those 5-star keeners, they didn't even mention the list of errors in this book.    And yes I pre-ordered this book and returned it within a week after receiving it.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The only benefit I had from buying the remastered version of Rubber Soul was to learn this is my favourite Beatles album. Looking at all the \\"new\\" Beatles cds I decided to get just one and give it a try. Why I did pick this one first? I do not know or maybe it is too long to explain, but no White Album nor Sargent Pepper's this time. For the rest I do not care about the \\"improvement\\" in sound some claim it was achieved with the remastered versions. To me it just sounds louder with enhancements of the bass all over and the vocals here and there (which by the way you can obtain by equalizing the music in your stereo or computer if you wish to do so). For example, in \\"You won't see me\\" it just sounds weird that the vocals overpower the music at some points where it did not before. Then it makes me wonder WHY MESS WITH PERFECTION? It is like if an old masterpiece gets a new blend of colours just because new technology is available and it can be done. If a work of art was done in a way, it is supposed to stay in that way, be it a paint, a sculpture, a book, or a piece of music. Now I am afraid to get dissapointed with the rest of the remastered collection. Therefore, this is it for me as far as the \\"new\\" albums. I rather stay with the Beatles music and sound as I learned to love and enjoy, instead of trying to love different versions of the same song.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was 17 when the Beatles released their first album here in the states.  It changed my DNA.  Those old mono albums I still have.  I stop listening to them a number of years ago for fear of damaging them and did a transfer to CD.    It never sounded quite the same as the vinyal . With the new mono set I can once again hear what I first heard those many years ago.  Nothing compares.  John sounds like he just chewed on razor blades on Twist and Shout.  \\"Your Gonna Lose That Girl\\" the best breakup song ever written was unbelievable.  Many good and informative reviews here so I will not get into that.  Just my own feelingsof listening to these sounds again they way I remember them.  Just takes my breath away.
B000002L5P|5.0|Full disclosure here; when The Smiths started inching closer to becoming my favorite band, I didn't, initially, think that their first album was that great. Not for any particular reason, mind you...I just didn't find any of these songs clicking the way tracks from their other albums had done. It was sheer laziness that lead to me to realize how great this album is (it's amazing what you can discover when you want to listen to \\"Reel Around the Fountain\\" and are too lazy to turn the rest of the album off). This 1984 debut album from Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke, and Mike Joyce is a perfect example of the music that they would continue to bless us with until their breakup a mere 3 years later. The songs are upbeat, poppy, and melancholy with bitingly true and poignant lyrics with a beauty that only The Smiths could provide.     Out of the album's 11 songs, only two stood out the first several times I listened to the album. The opening track \\"Reel Around the Fountain,\\" a beauty, moody opener. It's one of The Smiths most beautiful songs without a doubt...The other was \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves,\\" with the incessantly catchy refrain \\"I'm not the man you think I am...\\"     But this album has 9 more songs and every single one is great. With that said, there are songs on here that reviewers of this album have already pointed out; You've Got Everything Now, Miserable Lie, This Charming Man, and Hand in Glove. I love each and every one of these songs, but I want to talk about the more underrated tracks.    First of all, \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,\\" one of the most beautiful songs in The Smiths catalogue. The lyrics are terrific, but it's the way they all flow together and the way Morrissey sings them with a subtle sense of urgency that makes it so great. \\"Still Ill\\" is a great song, a sort-of nostalgic memory converted to music...Morrissey has said that \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\" is one of his least-favorite Smiths songs. Moz is a little too self-judgmental itwould seem, as I've loved this song since I heard it. \\"I Don't Owe You Anything\\" is rarely spoken of, but here's another slow-moving song. The amount of longing and pathos that Morrissey injects into these lyrics is very powerful. No other singer/lyricist could sing \\"I don't owe you anything...But you owe me something, repay me now\\" and make it sound important. The album closes with \\"Suffer Little Children,\\" a song about the Moors murders. This is the least accessible song on the album without a doubt...It's the song I never thought I would really start to enjoy, but after several listens this is a great song too. Not the kind you'd put on just to pass time, certainly...But it's great.    This album and the rest of The Smiths catalogue show why the band has had the staying power it has. Recorded in 1983 and released in 1984, this album has a sound that identifies it as an `80s production but this is nothing like any of the music that was coming out of that era. The Smiths, in their brief career, created something that was beautiful and unique...And it's remained the same since then. This debut album is one of their strongest works and is either my favorite or second favorite of the band's work.     The Smiths aren't a band for the masses and I like that; the fact that some people can't appreciate or enjoy this band only makes them more special in my opinion...A budding Smiths fan or a long-time Smiths fan will not want to pass this album up, as it's a musical masterpiece and, if you are a Smiths fan, I'm sure you'll agree.    GRADE: A
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I couldn't get this film out of my head for days. It's beautifully done horror.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I had a dream about five or six years ago that Bob Dylan had released a Christmas CD. No joke. Now it seems that the dream has come true. I can not believe the type of reviews that I've seen for this thing. Critisizing just about everything... from his voice, to his disloyalty to his Jewish heritage.  Hey... go back about thirty years and maybe your critisms will be relavant...<br /><br />If you've been paying any attention to to the Didge these last fifteen years, you will notice that he has been on a kick trying to span a wide spectrum of Americana and roots like material. This is just another entry into that style. Surely if 1960's  Bob Dylan tried to do a Christmas album it would be quite strange (in my dream it was like \\"heeeeeee-eeeere coooommmes saaaaantahhhh!--\\") but considering the stuff he's done of late, this is right up his street.<br /><br />It's fun... it's a bit comical, but if you put it on during the holidays, and don't tell anybody what it is... they'll either dig it, or won't know the difference from any other disc you put on. It's Dylans style of the last decade+ that I dig.  If you are still looking to him to be the voice of a sub culture, sorry, you missed the boat. I personally am holding out for the vinyl edition, available at the end of November, I can already tell it's gonna be rich, and I can't wait to play it for the fam over some heavilly boozed up nog and cider! Happy birthday JESUS!!!!
0451169514|4.0|Wow, what a book!  There's a lot to condense down into a brief review, but more than anything else, the characters made this book.  The story was an interesting one, but the characters are what brought it to life.  The book was not at all what I expected it to be:  a book about an evil clown that goes around killing people.  I was surprised by it at every turn, and the fact that it took me a month to read is a testament to how much I enjoyed it.  I was so busy with other stuff that I would have ordinarily given up on it, but I stuck with it to the end and it was well worth the trip.
044024367X|4.0|This is not as strong as others in the Jack Reacher series. It starts out strong with Reacher kicking butt and taking names, and really for the first two-thirds of the novel, the menace of the bad guys is there. However, during the last third if not half of the book, \\"Never mind\\" seems to be the theme. The weakest of endings severely wounds a strong effort at the onset. For those who are interested, the book also carries a slightly stronger anti-Christian tone than others in the series even though Reacher would never be mistaken for an evangelist.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|As I own many traditional holiday music CDs I ordered this assuming it would be nothing like my others and I was right. At first it seemed a bit 'goth' to me and somewhat dark but many of songs are ancient with (to my ears) a Celtic quality, and Sting's voice is, as ever, haunting. I particularly like 'Soul Cake' and 'Hounds of Winter'.  If you are bored with Fa-La-La this is for you, if you are looking for Santa, this is not.  However, I am reminded of the T.V. series 'Clatterford' when the Jennifer Saunders character says she \\"had a lovely time at Madonna and Guy Ritchie's party...until Sting played the lute\\".
0756405890|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, and loved it. I couldn't wait for the next two books in the trilogy. But each time I check, the date for book #2 has been moved *another* 6 months or more into the future. Patrick Rothfuss finished writing the books a long time ago! Come on, Publisher, please just PUBLISH because there are lots of readers out there who are waiting impatiently!
B000026FOA|4.0|This album seems to be one of his more somber pieces of work.  As mentioned in the title, this album is not my favorite of his, but it does offer another perspective into the fascinating, and slightly mysterious world of this man.  The title seems appropriate to the album's feel of the transition from autumn in to wintertime.  As a true Nick Drake fan, you should own this.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|I saw this film when it opened on July 24, 2009. Mixed reviews from fans and critics were the usual flair upon its release, but something struck me about this movie. The film went on to gross $37 million at the box-office despite the thrashing it took from critics, but everyone couldn't help but notice the Oscar-nomination worthy performance of its 12-year-old star Isabelle Fuhrman. I just viewed the film on DVD for the first time since its theaterical run and I'm still seeing just how riveting and engaging this movie really is.<br /><br />\\"Orphan\\" is NOT a horror film. It's more along the lines of a SUSPENSE THRILLER. When I think of horror films, I think of sex-crazed teenagers being sliced up one-by-one by a machete-wielding maniac (Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, Micheal Myers, etc.). The only real weapons wielded here is just a hammer, a knife, and a .38-caliber pistol. You think scary when it comes to horror films and \\"Orphan\\" isn't scary. Has some frightful moments, yes, but scary? Wishful thinking!<br /><br />Set in the winter-bound parts of Conneticut & Canada, the story centers on the Coleman family: Kate (Vera Farmiga), a Yale University music teacher recovering from alcoholism and bouts of depression after having a stillborn from her third pregnancy; John (Peter Sarsgaard), an architech whose nice guy persona overshadows his increasing issues with Kate that led to past affairs; Max (Aryana Engineer), their deaf 5-year-old daughter who communicates through sign language and their oldest son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who feels bitterly neglected & increasingly isolated from his parents. As a way of coping with the loss of their would-be 2nd daughter, Jessica, and to amend their existence as a family, Kate & John make a fateful decision to adopt a young girl at the local orphanage.<br /><br />It is here where they meet Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a sweet-looking 9-year-old Russian girl harboring some deep-seeded issues of her own despite her angelic smile and sympathetic mannerisms. Upon arriving home with new stepdaughter in tow, a series of events unravel to make everyone question the background and sincerity of this little girl. Daniel dislikes her immediately, Max forms an unhealthy bond with her new stepsister, Kate begins to seek out further information about Esther's background, & John just plays Devil's Advocate with all that occurs involving Esther. What's wrong with Esther? Is it true that behind the smile of this little angel beats the heart of a psycho killer?<br /><br />The answer, and the big secret about who she really is, lies within the confines of this 123-minute thriller. I agree with everyone here that it moves at a near-torturous snail's pace, that being the film's major fatal flaw. But the story itself is so entralling and engaging, you can't help but to excuse that misfire. Fuhrman's performance alone keeps you involved in the twists and turns entrenched here. Only a young, superbly talented actress like Fuhrman was able to pull off a psychological undertaking of switching from sympathetic manipulator to disturbed sadist and it's why I feel she should've gotten an Oscar nod. But due to the overall dislike of the film itself from most critics and for her young age, she didn't get anywhere near sniffing distance of the balloting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I was so inspired by this film and became such a fan that I created my own 20-song, hard-rock CD Mix (liner notes & all) of songs inspired by the movie (my own psuedo-soundtrack, if you will, but John Ottman's score was cool). Seemingly destined to go down as a cult favorite, if not a classic, \\"Orphan\\" was a solid & enjoyable thrill ride that's essentially \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\\", \\"The Good Son\\", \\"The Crush\\", and a more mean-spirited version of \\"Problem Child\\" all rolled into one. That's why this movie isn't a horror despite being classified as one. This film has a depth, substance, and intuitiveness to it that Jason, Micheal, & Freddy couldn't touch with a bloddy axe. Just take sweet, little Esther home and let her hold you, thrill you, kiss you, .... kill you!!! Can someone out there please say \\"CULT CLASSIC\\"? - DEM -eet, little Esther home and let her hold you, thrill you, kiss you, .... kill you!!! Can someone out there please say \\"CULT CLASSIC\\"? - DEM -
B002DGSQC8|1.0|I thought the \\"updated\\" version of this text it would be an improvement upon the previous version. If this is an improvement, I really feel for the owners of the previous version.<br /><br />My main, in fact my only, rub with this version is that it's so horribly formatted.  In the paper edition of this book, the author presents a rule relating to the elements of style.  He follows this with a misapplication of this rule. Then, he corrects and comments on the misapplication. Here's the rub: In the Kindle version of the book, YOU CANNOT READ THESE COMMENTS AND CORRECTIONS!<br /><br />It's like having a coach mumble instructions when you are on the court. It's maddening.<br /><br />It looks as if the publisher thought there was another inch of display to right of the screen. The problem resolves itself on the iPhone when you put the phone in landscape mode. However, this cannot be done with the Kindle and no amount of text augmentation or minimization corrects this error.<br /><br />The result is me using my phone AND my Kindle to read this text. Thumbs down.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Wonderful service. Fast delivery  Awesome series. Can't get enough. I've watched this twice already.
B00000F14B|5.0|Took longer than i thought it would to get here but well worth it. They dont Make e'm  this good any more. If you dont have it, get it! if you're like me you allready had it on VHS but wanted it on DVD for even better Sound.
B000GCFO08|5.0|First off, let me just say I am pretty new to Silent Hill. I've beaten Silent Hill 2 and 5 over the year, plus I've tried SH 1 & 4.<br /><br />I just recently watched this movie from beginning to end and was astounded! (I hadn't seen the whole movie when it first came out, only about 30 minutes.) Anyway, you don't need a Blu-Ray to appreciate the beauty of this film but you do need a home-theater to truly get the feeling! The ambience was very well accomplished, it felt alot like the games, this movie stayed true to the gamers & did not try to attract some brainless hollywood fanbase which probably couldn't even understand the movie anyway. I was surprised that this movie was actually a good game adaptation! Most of it's imitators failed miserably: Doom, Resident Evil, were there any others? I believe the reason it was so accomplished is thanks to Cristophe Gans who, if you watch the special features you will see is a true Silent Hill fan. However don't be fooled, this movie packs some mind-blowing special effects. It is a big budget film. The story is beautifully put together, not too confusing nor too revealing, just perfect. The imagery is dazzling, the colors, the details in the environment, everything was perfect in my opinion. The soundtrack stayed true to it's origins which is great. My only complaint was that Room Of Angel was not in the movie, too bad. Not a big problem though, this movie still falls into my all-time favorite movies category. If you are a fan of the games, well you've probably already seen it but for those of you who know nothing about the games, I think you could actually become a fan. This movie deserves at least a rental, if you're the least bit open-minded and not restricted by gore and action boundaries, you will enjoy this movie.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|I have always really enjoyed this story - wore out my old VHS video copy. We watched every January holidays with the kids. Great story, great 'one-liners' from the characters and everyone should see it.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The book is barely ok. My rating is 2.15 stars.    After an interesting start, the good guys all went stupid in terms of decisions and priorities.  I almost found myself cheering for the dark side.    After a fair amount of misdirection, the ending sort of fell apart.  Over the course of reading several Brown books, it is apparent that misdirection and weak endings are taking over his work.  As long as people keep buying, I predict that his next effort will have a very manipulative body and a frayed tail.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|Usually artists that focus on remaking songs never sing the songs as well as the original artists.  I know I actually get frustrated when I hear song remakes because its hard for me to appreciate the song when I keep hearing it from the original singer.  Well Michael Buble is an artist that definitely knows what he is doing.<br /><br />It has been two and a half years since Michael Buble has released a CD, but he is back with `Crazy Love' which came out October 9th.  This CD features two original songs along with his always original take on eleven classics from various extras.  He lived in recording studios from LA to Vancouver (his hometown) for the past 6 months to create as he calls it his \\"ultimate record about the inevitable roller coaster ride of relationships.\\"<br /><br />As a child I was always with my two grandmas and we drove everywhere.  Their favorite music was Frank Sinatra and big-band music and honestly Michael Buble's versions are a breathe of fresh air.  I love how he smooth and young his voice sounds throughout his `Crazy Love' CD.  It is mostly consistent with his other CD's so if you liked them, then this one will also be a winner and even if you haven't really liked Buble's music before but like one of the original tracks, its still worth checking out his take.  I did feel this CD was more pop-like than his others, but he still kept the big band jazz in the background.
1594132666|3.0|I read this because someone recommended it.  I liked the \\"Eat\\" section, was bored by the \\"Pray\\" section, and enjoyed the \\"Love\\" section.      What I did NOT like: the incessant whining tone and teariness.  I understand Gilbert went through a lot, but so have a lot of others.  Get a grip.  One reviewer called this \\"navel gazing\\" and I have to agree.  I think Gilbert should walk in some other people's shoes for a while and then see how bad her life is.  Try having your whole family out of work at the same time, or facing serious illness.  Getting a divorce because you \\"just can't stay in the marriage anymore\\" is way different from getting out because you are being beaten or cheated on.    What I DID like: I admired Gilbert for trying to solve her problems and feel better without pills or other types of self-medication or self-destructive behavior.  It's not easy to face your fears and insecurities and I found myself sympathizing with some of her issues since I also have them.  It made me feel like I can solve my problems too.    I think her writing style is good and I enjoyed some of her descriptive passages.  Overall, I enjoyed the book for what it was and might consider reading her next one.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I purchased the first season just to see if I would enjoy it, I could not get the second season fast enough! Now I must wait for the third. So far it seems that each season deals with a different wife. The story is compelling, the actors are great, costumes and scenery are fantastic. This is an amazing trip through history, very well written and beautifully acted. There is some violent scenes and it is not for children as there is alot of sex in it. If you don't have showtimes this is an excellent gift to receive or to give. There are hours of enjoyment that you can spread out over days or cuddle up for the day.
1439102813|5.0|I read and LOVED the novel \\"Still Alice\\" - what a marvel of research and writing, despite the disturbing topic of early-onset Alzheimer's. The book is written in Alice's voice and the reader experiences what she is going through and feeling at the gut level. The author is a neuroscientist and really knows her stuff!<br /><br />The author, Lisa Genova, self-published this book with encouragement from the Alzheimer's Foundation (I think that was the organization). Then Simon and Schuster picked it up (3 publishing houses wanted it) and the rest is history...it debuted at #5 on the NY Times bestseller list.... and I think much of its \\"publicity\\" has been word-of-mouth.<br /><br />Genova is working on a new novel, \\"Left Neglected\\", \\"the story of a woman whose car accident results in a brain injury that creates a known condition called 'Left Side Neglect'. In that condition, the brain doesn't see or process anything on a person's left side\\". She talks about it in the back of Still Alice (which I have already loaned out).<br /><br />It will be a long time before I stop thinking about Alice and her struggles, her identity, and her family. This book was amazing.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Of course Sid the Elf is very familiar with The Shining. But we hadn't reviewed it until now. Why? Good question. For October Horrorgreatsuccess Sid festival it was a no-brainer. This is one is in the pantheon of horror films. Also, Scatman Crothers has been a Sid favorite since 96 and the crazy likely homeless nutjob at Yankee Stadium. Sid has seen bits and pieces(that's what it's like...u know where it's going) of this film many times over the years but this viewing was a little different. This time Sid was watching with his carefully crafted critical eye gained with thousands of B's on our odometer.<br /><br />Knowing full well what happens in the movie, after not seeing it for at least a few years, Sid found Jack really interesting. Even in the begining of the flick you can see that he's a little psycho. And while we're here, could anyone else have played Jack Torrence? Sid says absolutely not. He plays a nutbar to perfection. And nobody else could have pulled off being a maniac and hilarious at the same time(exhibit A: the \\"Have you lost your f**kin' mind scene). Now, The Shining is in no way shape or form B, but it is a horror classic so it's in play for Sid. This is especially true when you account for the Chuck factor and the awesome visuals accompanied by cool/creepy music.<br /><br />The Shining was an overall awesome experiance. It is obviously a must for any horror fan who hasn't seen it. Also, if you're a horror fan and haven't seen this movie, shame on you. If you're missing the B element in this Sid review, don't worry. There are several B's on the horizon. Can Sid interest anyone in a little Maniac Cop? As for The Shining, here's a quick rundown of the film's scariest moments:<br /><br />1. The dog and the butler. Holy schnikies.<br />2. The little girls<br />3. The cranberry juice pouring out of the elevator.<br />4. Scatman getting it and Jacks's war cry<br />5. Who's the old lady?<br />6. redrum<br />7. the picture at the end
B000000993|5.0|I'll admit, it took me quite a few listens to actually fall in love with this album.  If you're new to Tool, I personally would say not to get this as your first or second album. I'd first buy Lateralus. But anyway, it takes some patience to love it. Some key tracks would be, Undertow, 4 Degrees, Sober, and Swamp Song.
B0000TB014|5.0|My family and I sat down and watched this togeather. This was great we really enjoyed it. Michael does awesome work. The video was not to long at all, it left you wanting more so see.

The one thing my son said to me is that no matter who is in the video with Michael, he always draws your eyes back to him and that is so true.    I LOVED IT
0385504225|2.0|This lackluster effort by Dan Brown reminds me of the way that Thomas Harris followed up on the brilliant \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" with the putrid \\"Hannibal\\". It seems that Brown tried to use essentially the same plot as the \\"DaVinci Code\\", just substituting names and some minor details. Virtually every character type established in The Code was represented again, but not nearly as well. In spots, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was mildly interesting but Brown's stilted writing style was much more noticeable (and annoying) when conjoined with a lesser plot. Lastly, it would be nice to see some continuity in the storyline from book to book. Brown developed some very likable characters in \\"Code\\" and it would have been nice to see at least one make even a cameo appearance.    In short, I found the book to be sub-par with a less than believable plotline. If you're expecting \\"The DaVinci Code\\" Part II, you'll be disappointed.
B002HWUU1I|4.0|Who doesn't already know the charming story of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, the creative (and for a while, romantic) couple who acted and performed in that indie film gem from Ireland, \\"Once\\"?  It was a bit of an underdog triumph when they won the \\"Best Song\\" Oscar last year for \\"Falling Slowly\\", arguably the best romantic ballad of the decade.  Now they follow up that success with a new album under their collective name, The Swell Season.  It's a more polished affair than either their debut album or the \\"Once\\" soundtrack, but it's also much more cohesive.  You won't hear Hansard's raw, shouting vocals that punctuated the songs from \\"Once\\", but that's not a problem.  This is definitely a mellower affair, and the songwriting is every bit as strong and more mature. It's not as cathartic as some of the songs from \\"Once\\", but it's still quietly moving.
B002436WJE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The only problem was some of the filming.  At times you could not determine in which car the main character was located, especially since the chase vehicles looked identical.  I think that every parent should see this movie, especially parents of girls.  Despite the intense  action, there are relatively few profane words.  That is a real plus for me.  I guess I would see more movies if they were not profane.  Liam Neeson did not disappoint in this movie.  I have enjoyed watching him in the past in \\"Star Wars, The Phantom Menace\\".

B002M3SP28|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a favorite writer - his style is crisp and clean and the chapters are brief. I knew nothing about mountaineerig or ever read about the history of climbing Mt Everest, but this story had me studying the Everest landscape on Google Earth and searching for web sites that had information about Mallory and his life. It is unfortunate that the book did not include a single picture of Mt Everest, or the route that the Mallory team used in the attempt to reach the summit. The disclaimer that the book is a work of fiction etc., etc. is a stretch (OK, it may be historical fiction) but does that alone disqualify the publisher from including some helpful maps or photographs of the \\"characters\\" in the story?

0385504225|2.0|This book, while entertaining, is FICTION, yet it highlights the TRUE involvement of Masonry in the foundation of our nation.    While it is an entertaining read, as Dan Brown points out symbols, codes, and clues to the Mason mind set, his fictional story points out the seemingly hidden yet obvious intentions of secret societies. Secret Orders like the Golden Dawn, Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and others have all been infused with mystical cult ideas from Hermeticism.    (Hermeticism is a false teaching which includes both panentheism and Monistic-polytheism and it promotes the notion that other beings such as gods and angels, ascended masters and elementals exist in the Universe as parts of the All.)    Many false teachers promote the heretical Hermetical slogan, \\"As above, so below.\\" This occult teaching misleads people and gives them false hopes! One should read the Bible before reading this or other books like this to understand the TRUTH about Jesus, the universe, creation, and the gospel of salvation brought to humankind. This is quite a FICTIONAL STORY laced with TRUTH about secret orders, their codes, secrets, rituals, meanings and how they influenced, and continue to influence, powerful people in our nation and other nations of the world.    The final chapters of this book are Dan Brown's attempt to promote the New, (and old), Age philosophy of man becoming God. Dan uses quotes from the Bible and blends them skillfully with untruths. He tries to link all religions and science together as a path for man becoming God. This subtle infusion and intermingling of truth with fiction will, sadly, fool many people!    Jesus said, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\\" The way to heaven is through Jesus! Those who think they are becoming God, by using their mind over matter, to gain wealth, power, and position are only fooling themselves. Our only hope and salvation is in Christ Jesus!
B002H3F7F6|4.0|When I first listened to this album (which I purchased immediately, being a huge Sting fan) I found myself... unfulfilled, to say the least. I agreed with some of the other reviewers that his voice doesn't quite have the same punch it usually does. Resolute to put it in the back of my collection, I wisely decided to actually LISTEN (in the recliner, no distractions) with headphones and not through computer speakers. Although his voice shows signs of fatigue (anyone remember a little 'tour' that him and the Police had last year? That might have played a part in this) the lyrics and musicianship turn out to be a saving grace for this album. I even learned to get used to this new 'seasoned' voice of his, much like I did when I started to embrace Joni Mitchell's whiskey soaked rasp on \\"Both Sides Now.\\"    I encourage those Sting fans who've already bought this album to listen to it again without too much distraction and you too might find it to be a diamond in the rough after all. Let's trust our friend, Gordon Sumner to continue to bring great music to those who appreciate real music.

B0007KTBIU|4.0|This was my first DVD purchase from Amazon.com.  It arrived on-time and shipped with proper protection for the DVD.  I greatly enjoyed the film with the vibrant colors of the scenes and wonderful musical scores.   I would highly recommend this film!

B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I'd say just go to iTunes. They're offering disc two with demo tracks for $6.99.
B001CTDH76|4.0|I didn't get into this show until about halfway through the season, and then it was only out of idle curiosity.  I am glad I did.  I won't waste your time with what it's about--you probably already know that--and get directly into why I like it.<br /><br />Why I like it is the character of Patrick Jane.  I've been watching TV and movies regularly for 20 years now, and I can honestly say I do not have him figured out.  While it would be easy to dismiss his motives as being guilt (making up for all the years he posed as a fraud) or revenge for his murdered family, I do not think it is that simple.  I think there is something more to him, something that he hasn't revealed yet, and Simon Baker does a magnificent job portraying this very interesting character.  I am looking forward to the second season.<br /><br />PS:  As for the whole \\"Mentalist\\" versus \\"Psych\\" debate, I will say it is all a matter of taste.  I tried \\"Psych\\" and did not like because I found the lead character highly annoying--but that's just me.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|I generally don't buy anything post-'85. Had often heard the name 'Michael Buble' bandied about, and I genuinely thought he was some idols runner-up pushing out some few albums consisting mainly of covers. Then, while browsing through the jazz section in a local store, a stranger struck up a conversation with me, and opened his diary with a list of recommendations that others had made to him. On a page all on its own I saw written the name 'Michael Buble'. I asked the gent why he's want to listen to that. Said he'd seen snippets from a DVD and could not believe that a white youngster could sing jazz so brilliantly. He said if he could find this CD/DVD he would buy it without hesitation. Thought I'd give it a listen myself. KAPOW! Here I had someone singing like Sinatra, except much, much better. I never previously bought any of this type of music because I never found it done in a way appealing enough to me. But now I had found it. A couple of Buble albums later, this remains my favourite. The live situation brings out the genius in this incredibly talented man. He sings so utterly effortlessly and has a magnetic, electrifying yet adorable and comfortable stage personality. The arrangements are also so stylish. His voice is now human, now taking on the timbre of some unknown wind instrument. I am indeed overawed! And oh - regarding the covers... keep singing them Michael, because you surely make them your own.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|What attracted me first to this series was Nathan Fillion; ever since seeing him in [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] and [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]], I have followed him with great interest.  While this is your typical \\"buddy\\" cop show, what makes it work is the visible chemistry on screen; not only do he and Stana Katic remind me of the early years of [[ASIN:B0007XBMA2 Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2]], but I also like the relationships he has with his mother and daughter; with each one, he is a different person, and he pulls it off very well.  If you didn't see it when it aired, give this one a chance.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I purchased this title with the Biography title of John Adams.    It is an excellent program, although I had trouble keeping straight the characters,  Watching this series the second time solved that problem.  In this series, all details were paramount.  This viewer felt as tho she was in Boston, or New York, or Philadelphia, in those early days!  The \\"Boston Massacre\\" story was told way differently than it was from my grade school days!  And that John Adams was the representative in court for the accused British soldiers was never told in grade school history!  David Morse portraying George Washington was a perfect casting choice!  Various details of the various characters were also revealed in this series.  For example, the founding fathers are always depicted in paintings as having hair, as school childeren, we are told they wore wigs.  But when the founding fathers go to their lodging or home, they took their hair off & hung it, like they did their hats.  That John Adams had a temper, I didn't know previously.  He was a man, like any other man & this series doesn't \\"sugar-coat\\" his flaws.  In fact each character's flaws as well as their strengths are revealed.  A sad scene was when john went to the home of his son Charles, in a dirty back-street of New York, only to find his son passed-out from booze on his kitchen table.  John shows a little \\"tough-love\\" to Charles & disowns him right then & there.  Abigail is saddened by this, because he was joy in her life the years John was in France & England.  Another gizzley scene is when a doctor performs a mastectomy on John's daughter \\"Nabby\\".  The viewer feels as tho she is going to witness a battle-field scene of a limb amputation.  Even the fact that the teeth would be decaying is part of the make-up as the scenes of life progresses.  The genuine love & friendship are also portrayed here.    This video set features a sub-program \\"facts are stubborn things\\", in which various little factoids are displayed like sub-titles through the programs.  These are very interesting, although in somecases, they are not displayed long enough to be read.  In cases like this, I simply \\"re-wound\\" as I would a vdeo-tape and re-read them.  The first time i watched this series, I din't use that feature.  What is supposed to happen, I think is if the viewer clicks on that factoid, there is supposed to be further information.  Perhaps, viewing the DVDs on my computer will allow that further exploration.  When I attempted to click on it with my TV & DVD player, nothing happened.      The only negative things I have to say about this series is the length is a bit too-long, but if it is viewed in segments, as it would have been aired, it's much more comfortable.  And, I had trouble keeping-straight the characters.  What exactly causes the \\"rift\\" between John Adams & Thomas Jefferson, that lasted for many years is not made clear.  That Abigail's death is the event that leads John to \\"touch base\\" with Thomas again, reveals that John held grudges for a long time too.    I am glad I purchased this video set.  It might be a good reference for junior high or high school papers also.  This video set was purchased used & it was in perfect condition.  If there is a sizeable price difference between purchasing a used copy or new, my recommendation would be to purchase the used copy.

B000002BFL|3.0|If good intentions translated into great results every time out, then Bruce Springsteen on THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD would be an undisputed home run. But I have to say, honestly, that I've found listening to it a frustrating experience each time I've put it on.<br /><br />First off, why is it that the Boss has convinced himself that he's more sincere and more heartfelt when he MUMBLES all of his words rather than sings straight out? Seriously, I had to read the lyric sheet most of the time to figure out what he was singing (I did make out the word \\"methamphetamine\\" in \\"Sinaloa Cowboys,\\" though). The more fundamental issue for me, though, is that I simply don't find Bruce Springsteen as interesting when he's NOT singing about HIS life experiences, or at the very least those that he's more familiar with directly as opposed to just having read about. And it's not just a matter of \\"artists should stick to what they know:\\" Steve Earle, for example, has a LOT of third-person-narrative songs, many of which are much more engaging than what is on TGOTJ, and as wild as Earle's life has been, I'm still sure he didn't experience ALL he sings about first-hand. But even Springsteen's first truly solo album, NEBRASKA (which has some aural kinship with TGOTJ) had third-person songs that grabbed you at once, as well as several first person ones where he sings simply, unaffectedly and touches your heart. That just doesn't happen for me with TGOTJ, although the last song, \\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\\" comes close.<br /><br />I wouldn't have singled out TGOTJ like this were it not for the feeling I've had that with each release since then, Springsteen has become more and more remote and disconnected from the experiences he sings about. He shouldn't have to keep making BORN TO RUN over and over again, granted, but it wouldn't hurt for him to go back to it once in awhile and see what made it work. Or, for that matter, NEBRASKA.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I can't tell you how excited I was when I got word that Snow White was coming out on Blu Ray, and that was before I learned of the Diamond Edition. There are SO many special features to this edition that really makes it come to life, and takes you back in time. As a little girl, I would sit for hours watching the original and now, my little girl will sit for hours watching Snow White, as well. She's even going to dress like Snow White for Halloween!     Blu Ray just makes each scene really come to life, and the behind the scenes footage was a first time look for me as well.     5 Stars here, much better quality than I expected, given the film is so much older!

B002Q4U9YU|1.0|CD1....As far as I am concerned this is it, is the biggest piece of crap and scam ever put out by Sony. WTF, I was expecting an album with all the songs from the movie like a.....soundtrack!!!!!, not a bunch original songs I already have. I've been a fan since I was 12, I am now 53, and I can tell you...Michael would have no let this garbage out, unless it was all material from the movie. This is what I really call taking advantage of someone's death.    CD2 ..... is OK, but 3 songs and a pom doesn't cut it for all the hoopla raised by the release of this CD. Heck buy the MJ remixed suites I,II,III and IV mp3s separately, that's much,.... much better than this garbage and it is how I better remember Michael....with the J5.    Sorry SONY this is FRAUD!!!!!!and very missleading,... and if i am reading the reviews correctly, there are a lot of pissed off people out there.    WL

Not only does this book serve as a quick refresher course on what an element actually IS, but each element is beautifully presented, with everyday examples of its presence in our lives. This would be a great coffee table book for anyone interested in chemistry, science, or the nature of things.

B002MEW7YY|5.0|Saw this production on HD-theatre and on PBS re-run; and the Zimmerman production is wonderful.  I have seen a number of Lucia's with great singers (includidng La Scala) but it was always hard to get to the end.  This production makes the story more \\"watchable\\" and very enjoyable to the very end (which I will not disclose in a review). Have been waiting for this release since the initial showing, and can not wait to add this to my collection.  The singing, of course, was MET opera superb.
1594488878|5.0|At the end of Hornby's latest and highly entertaining novel it's as if you are standing in a room in which steamer trunks have been opened and the contents strewn everywhere.  You did not realize there was so much stuff--good stuff--and you are left wondering where did this all come from and how do you organize it succinctly in an Amazon review?<br /><br />Anyway, Juliet, Naked begins with Duncan, an instructor at a community college in the drab seaside town of Gooleness on the English coast, a man who has not noticed that he has slipped into middle age while he pursues what he considers an important mission and most others view as an obsession: everything there is to know about an American rock star, Tucker Crowe, who famously dropped out of public view at the height of his career back in 1986.  Duncan curates a website and discussion groups for self-proclaimed \\"Croweologists\\" who pick apart Crowe's life and music.  The Croweologists preen with their knowledge and expertise.  One of the most recent additions to the website is a picture taken by a fan who believes he has tracked Crowe to a farm in Pennsylvania.  Meanwhile, Duncan's girlfriend, Annie, is considering that she has wasted the last fifteen years with a man whose true love is his obsession, leaving her facing middle age unmarried, childless and working in a tiny civic museum.  What no one expects is that Tucker Crowe will enter this world built, after all, entirely around his own past and the one recent photograph, and force everyone to question perceptions, obsessions and hobby horses, and just what it means to \\"have a life.\\"<br /><br />Hornby writes fluently and he writes wicked funny.  He is a talented carpenter of classic novelistic structure.  He endows his flawed characters with an appealingly honest humanity.  But he is controlled: he keeps the \\"big themes\\" right on eye-level and does not insist on beating up the reader.  He's an unapologetic moralist who resists sentimentality and oversimplification. Good guy, fine writer.
B002Q4U9YU|2.0|An all demo album(with the \\"This is It\\" song) would've been better. Look, I love MJ, but let's be honest here. The free world already owns these tunes! I thought multiple hits packages were bad enough when he was here, we don't need anymore. It's time for the Tupac treatment.

0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol is about what you would expect as a years-late follow-up to Da Vinci Code: a formula that works and keeps you turning the pages, shallow characters and plenty of suspense and action. But two things drag this book down:  1. The plot that you read his books for winds up tightly as you would expect, but then you get 45 pages of drivel that try to tie up loose ends and make the make arc of the story relevant to your spirituality.  2. Brown's treatment of Masons goes beyond the casual and intriguing education that you read his books for and digresses into infatuation, glorification and justification of their traditions. I knew little about Masons before reading this and now feel like I know less.    I'm glad I read this as an easy, fast-paced thriller, but by the end I felt like I was reading Dianetics.
0676978010|1.0|I was not aware that Ms. Klein was a non-English speaker.  How else could one explain her complete misinterpretation of Milton Friedman?  Either she does not understand Milton Friedman's own words or she purposely chooses to distort the meaning.    Save yourself a few dollars and hours of wasted time.  Skip this book and instead read Milton Friedman's far superior  classic, \\"[[ASIN:0226264211 Capitalism and Freedom: Fortieth Anniversary Edition]].\\"    Yes, I agree, there were many bad players during the 2008 economic meltdown leading to \\"the Great Recession.\\"  Don't forget that the U.S. federal government played a significant role in the fiasco ranging from the lack of SEC enforcment of existing securities laws to the lack of Congressional oversight of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the many failings of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and Treasury to the long-term effects of deficit spending and heavy borrowing from foreign countries.  However, NONE of these failings originated from Friedman's market-based philosophies or policies.    There is a very simple test of Mr. Freidman's ideas.  Which policies were more prosperous for its population, China under the Communist ideals of Mao (the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, 30 million dead) or China under the market-based reforms of Deng (the most-recent Asian economic miracle)?  Which policies were more proposerous for its population, East Germany under socialist rule, or East Germany after reunification with the market-based West?    The many flaws of Ms. Klein's book are well discussed in the following article.  Google the following text.    \\"Defaming Milton Friedman:  Naomi Klein's disastrous yet popular polemic against the great free market economist\\"
0307454541|5.0|I found this book a while ago due to the bright cover and the need to kill time in a boutique bookstore while my son was with his math tutor. And along with Caleb Carr's The Alienist, which I also found in the same bookstore years before because of its cover, this is a great piece of original mystery fiction that should be regarded as excellent fiction rather than just a mystery. The success of this work and the next book - The Girl Who Played with Fire - testifies to its qualify. The girl in question is a Dickensian character but totally twenty first century - a combination I did not think possible. Her male counterpart is something of a cad by American standards -- but also a hero journalist American readers should be as comfortable with as any other \\"outsider\\" going after the truth. I read a couple of books a week and have written two mysteries I am now trying to get published and I envy the late Mr. Larsson's ability to write - even in translation his work is wonderful. If you like contemporary fiction, or mysteries, or offbeat characters -- this is the best book you will read for many years.

B002BSHWUU|2.0|I had been waiting for these remasters for years.  I was expecting to be be blown away by the remastering but sadly, I just shrug my shoulders.  For the vast majority of the albums, the original releases actually sound better than the new remastered versions.  Revolver in particular is terrible.  It's muddy and does not have the clarity of the original release.  I can only hear a slight improvement in Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be - an album that never sounded great in the first place so the only place that it could go was up.  Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, and Abbey Road are just a tad louder - that's it.  Big disappointment.
B002R0EIVI|5.0|Rarely am I so gripped by a movie that I did not want to blink! With all sincerity, this is by far the BEST film in all respects. I just returned from the Premiere and I can't wait to go back to the theater tomorrow to experience the magic again.<br /><br />As this movie is from the footage of rehearsals for his 50 concert performances in London, Michael Jackson was extraordinarily \\"hands on\\" regarding every facet of the concert \\"experience\\" he was creating.<br /><br />What I paid special attention to was Michael's appearance as far as health is concerned. I can ASSURE you this Gift to Humanity named Michael Jackson was at PEAK performance. He looked radiant, happy, he had a huge amount of energy, he was clearly in love with the process of creating something to make this world a better place - and he said so during rehearsals.<br />With such super high energy that went into the rehearsals, I think just about anyone would have difficulty winding down to go to sleep. It is my pure opinion that Michael accidentally too more medicine to help him sleep, without realizing it was too much.<br /><br />The energy Michael and ALL who were involved in these rehearsals exuded that \\"It\\" quality - the kind that is almost indefinable in words - that transports you with awe INTO the experience.<br /><br />The movie Director, producers, special effects, make-up, costume, musicians, the dancers who performed with Michael during these final rehearsals before his passing are all PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />I feel we owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the special souls who actually took the footage during the rehearsals. What a GIFT you have given humanity.<br /><br />THIS IS IT is an extraordinary legacy that will remain with me forever, and I believe it will with you as well!<br />10 Billion Stars!

B001WCBPCW|4.0|Kasabian caused a sensation in its native UK with the release of its 2004 self-titled debut album. Their second album, 2006's \\"Empire\\", was generally not well received, although I loved it. Now, after a long lay-off, finally comes the band's eagerly-anticipated third album.<br /><br />\\"West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum\\" (12 tracks; 52 min.) kicks off with a rousing \\"Underdog\\", which is followed by the best track on the album (for me), \\"Where Did All The Love You\\", with an irresitable underlying beat. After a short (and pointless) instrumental, another great track follows, \\"Fast Fuse\\". The first half of the album concludes with less urgent, but still quite ok, tracks \\"Take Aim\\" and \\"Quick As Thieves\\". I rate the first half of the album 4 stars. The second half starts off with a nice \\"West Ryder Silver Bullet\\" but then loses focus and intensity. Too many unmemorable tunes, frankly. The last highlight is \\"Fire\\" (1st UK single), opening slowly but then crashing in, and another great sing/hum-along. The closeing track \\"Happiness\\", though, is a headscratcher, a complete departure of the \\"Kasabian sound\\" (featuring a soul-sounding choir no less). I rate the second half of the album 3 stars.<br /><br />In all, this is quite a disappointing album for me. Gone is the brash, thundering sound of the earlier albums. I've seen Kasabian in concert before, and they were fabulous. I'm gonna venture that most of the songs from this album will rock much harder live than on here, and I can only hope to get an opportunity to see these guys live again (they don't tour the US much, sadly).
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I hate when reviews turn into wars between two different kinds of customer.    This is an excellent movie - but it is not a standard sci-fi blockbuster. If you liked Independence Day or Aliens /and/ you want more of the action and 'freaky evil aliens' themes of those movies, District 9 will be a one star experience, even a zero star experience for you.    If you don't know where South Africa is, or what 'Apartheid' is, it will also be a confusing experience.    No rush to judgement, there are plenty of good movies that you can watch without needing to enjoy a weird alien-filled allegory about how humans treat each other. Because that's what District 9 is, it's first and foremost about humans and how we treat each other. Like some of the best thoughtful science fiction out there, it uses the aliens as an allegorical vehicle to describe the way our world is, and how badly we treat each other sometimes. It's not always fun to watch, there are sometimes pacing issues, but all in all, an excellent movie for a certain kind of audience.    ALSO: Can we please get spoiler warnings?? Or a way to tag the reviews of others that are spoiler-filled? I find it offensive when someone drops a one star review on a movie, but essentially gives away the whole movie. Be kind, its possible to explain why you hated something without ruining it for others who may enjoy it.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I just got back from seeing This is It, I bought the CD yesterday, at first I thought the same thing as everyone else, that the cd was just a whole bunch of songs I already own, which it is actually. I guess it is just the powers that be way of making the fans feel as if the were a part of the concert experience? Every song that is on the cd is in the same order in the film.     P.S.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I was in the movie theater and watched with awe the entire premiere of this phenomenal movie just after midnight October 28.<br /><br />THIS IS IT the Movie is extraordinary. Rarely am I so gripped by a movie that I did not want to blink! I was hoping the movie would be made available in DVD - buying this DVD is a MAJOR GIFT!<br /><br />During each rehearsal Michael Jackson was passionately hands on regarding every facet of the concert experience he was creating.

When you see this movie you will understand why.<br /><br />{An Update} Tonight, December 3, 2009, I saw the final showing of this amazing film for the 5th time. I was just as glued to the screen as I was the first time. I never cried before for what I could only describe as a poignant ending, but I did tonight. THIS IS IT is so much more about the care Michael Jackson had for humanity, and our planet.<br /><br />He said, \\"I've always loved trees, I get upset at the mismanagement of our planet, that every minute trees the size of a football field is cut down in the Amazon rain forest... It's up to us to fix this and we only have four years left before it's irreversible. People say the government will fix this, \\"they\\" will fix this, \\"they\\", they who? It's up to us.

B00005JLSE|4.0|You can credit `Chicago' with bringing the beloved musical back into our lives, even if it doesn't really deserve the full credit.  Just the year before the marvelous (and superior) `Moulin Rouge!' managed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and surely paved the way for `Chicago' to win the Oscar.  The year before that `art house' master Lars von Trier gave us the brilliant `Dancer in the Dark', and while it didn't manage a Best Picture nomination, it caused a major stir with the critics and definitely got a lot of people talking.  So, what I guess I'm trying to say is that, while `Chicago' is regarded as the musical of this generation, it didn't capture that title on its own merits.<br /><br />It is a great film, truly absorbing and thoroughly entertaining; but it is far from the best musical of this generation.<br /><br />Taking a saucy stage play and giving it its due on the big screen is a big undertaking.  I have seen the stage play a few times and devour it every time; it's that stunningly entertaining.  For me, and this should really go for nearly everyone, a musical lives and dies with the VOICES carrying the songs.  If someone cannot sing, they should NOT be in a musical.<br /><br />I wanted to get that out of the way.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Roxie Hart, the aspiring singer who gets a little carried away during a lovers spat and takes a man's life.  Claiming self defense, Roxie gets help from attorney Billy Flynn, who capitalizes off her story to get publicity.  Roxie's doting husband Amos waits in the shadows as his wife's popularity grows, but when Roxie finds herself being `forgotten' by the public she has to go to even greater extremes to keep their attention.<br /><br />I really liked the way that director Gary Marshall constructed the film.  It has this out of body quality to the musical numbers, which makes sense in the setting.  It gives it a very `showy' feel that gives the illusion of watching a cabaret variety show.  This approach is needed to give the film some style; style that suits the premise and atmosphere.<br /><br />The film is very `razzle dazzle'.<br /><br />As far as the performances are concerned, there is a lot of love here.  Thank GOD Catherine Zeta-Jones won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of the washed up Velma Kelly.  She ravishes on screen and just completely engulfs every scene she is in.  Her `song and dance' pleading with Roxie is sensational to put it lightly.  She clearly outshines the rest of the cast, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the cast falters.  A lot has been said about Renee Zellweger and her lack of singing talent.  Like I said, a musical must be judged on the VOICES carrying the songs, but in this case, it is that lack of talent that works in her favor.  She is an aspiring singer, and one gets the impression that she is aspiring because she lacks the talent to really survive.  She is arrogant and pretty confident, but the fact remains that she hasn't made it.  She needs this trial to become a star, and that speaks volumes for her natural talent.  I adore Zellweger here.<br /><br />As far as voices go, one doesn't get much better than Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.  They are the best vocals in the bunch, yet sadly they give the most mediocre performances.  I love Reilly, and in 2002 he had a stellar year (appearing in THREE Best Picture nominees; `Chicago', `Gangs of New York' and `The Hours', as well as the independent film `The Good Girl').  His Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars was clearly a nod to his success as an actor, but he was nominated for the wrong film.  His subdued and emotional work in `The Good Girl' should have nabbed him the nomination.  Latifah has a showier role, and her `vavavavoom' performances really add some color to the film; but she's sadly lacking in screen time.<br /><br />Reading that they once considered Kevin Spacey for the role of Flynn makes me a little sad, since he is not only a stunning actor but a brilliant singer and he would have chewed this up (and may have even walked away with an Oscar) but the lackluster Richard Gere took on the role and just does NOTHING for me here.  His voice is very mediocre, his performances are awkward and while I actually found his quick witted delivery in his spoken scenes to be entertaining he just never really comes together as a complete character to me.<br /><br />I was put off.<br /><br />The film can at times be all over the place, but it makes up for it with ample amounts of style that get poured all over every scene like syrup.  It works.  Yes, it is overrated, but that doesn't mean it doesn't prove itself a visual feast and a memorable experience.  When you look at the year that was 2002 you instantly think of `Chicago', and rightfully so.  Sure, `The Pianist' was a much better film, but `Chicago', without a doubt, is the one you are going to want to watch again and again and again.<br /><br />And BTW, those set pieces and costumes are all sorts of spectacular!en walked away with an Oscar) but the lackluster Richard Gere took on the role and just does NOTHING for me here.

B000001EL7|5.0|This band has been overlooked by the rock-n-roll hall of fame for the last 10 years.I was lucky enough to see all of the original members in 1978 on the Dynasty tour.You can't say enough about this band.
B00005QGAX|4.0|When this album was first released I could not figure out why it was considered \\"rock\\" or a transition to \\"rock\\".  I still can't figure it out over 20 years later.  But, listening to Michael Jackson's work in 2009 underscores how sophisticated an artist and singer he really was with songs like \\"Man in the Mirror\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\".  He was only 28 years old (or younger) when he created all of this work which was released just two days following his 29th birthday, on August 31, 1987.  These songs took him into the next decade without sounding dated---that is genius!<br /><br />After Michael Jackson's death, I purchased the Special Edition and a copy of the original version released in Japan.  The gem on the original version is the introduction for the song \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" where he speaks a verse before he begins singing.<br />Don't understand why the following spoken introduction was removed from the later versions of the song:<br /><br />I just want to lay next to you for awhile/You look so beautiful tonight/Your eyes are so lovely/Your mouth is so sweet/A lot of people misunderstand me/That's because they don't know me at all/I just want to touch you/I need you/I love you so much<br /><br />See: \\"Bad(album \\" at Wikipedia for a list of additions and omissions between the Special Edition and the original Bad albums.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|We don't own a Blu-ray player or a Sony PlayStation 3 (that plays Blu-ray), so why do we need a Blu-ray Snow White?  Well, for the first time in seven years, Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I have it because I'm participating in the campaign to get the word out about it.  The complimentary copy that I received from One2One Network is the Diamond Edition which includes both the DVD and the Blu-ray in the same box.  While we don't have the ability to play a Blu-ray, we have a few DVD players, a DVD player built into a small TV, the XBox 360 that plays DVDs and a DVD player in the van.  We could totally make immediate use of the DVD that is included in the Diamond Edition and still be prepared for the technology upgrade should we ever decide to get a Blu-ray player or game console that plays them.<br /><br />In case you had never realized it, Disney has a Halley's comet method of releasing classic movies - every once in a long while.  I'm not saying that it's a bad thing.  Actually, from manufacturing and marketing standpoints, it's genius.  Classic movies probably aren't a perpetual high-sale item so short-run, high quantity, occasional releases limit dead-stock on shelves while also giving the marketing crew the ability to work the \\"limited\\" angle.  Essentially, what it does is make you decide if you really want the movie or not because like the commercials say \\"Once it's gone...\\" you don't know when it will be available again.<br /><br />I remember several years ago (well before I had kids) laughing at my aunt for her collection of Disney movies.  As each new one came out, she would purchase it.  She explained, \\"I don't have grandkids now, but I will\\" and that she wanted to make sure she had the movies when they were ready to watch them.  Until that time, I had never noticed that you couldn't just walk into a store and purchase any Disney movie of your choice.  I had always thought that \\"get it before it's gone\\" thing was just a marketing pitch.  But sure enough, ever since then, I've paid attention and watched movies come and go - usually re-introduced to accommodate the changing technology.  In this case, Blu-Ray.  Seven years ago, it was probably to introduce the movie in DVD format.  So seriously, when a Disney movie comes out that we might want, we consider if we want to buy it because we don't know when it will be available again!<br /><br />We sat down and watched the movie last weekend and my girls loved it.  They are familiar with Cinderella and several of the other Disney princesses, but despite having various Snow White toys and books, they just didn't relate to her.  For one of their birthdays, we got a Snow White figure set (Polly Pocket size) that contained a few outfits, four pair of shoes and two dwarfs.  The girls cast the dwarfs aside and welcomed Snow White into their Polly Pocket environment.  Never did I hear them refer to her as Snow White.  They just really didn't understand because they had not seen the movie and even though I've read the book to them, they just didn't gravitate to the characters.  We also own a Disney princess joystick video game that hooks up to the television.  I was always surprised that they didn't like playing the Snow White \\"Hide and Seek\\" game.  The day after we watched the movie that we received from One2One Network, the girls began to unearth all the various Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs paraphernalia that they had.  The sad part is that it has made me realize that just reading the stories in a children's book isn't enough to really bring the characters to life.  I'm wondering what other stories I read and movies I saw as a child my daughters haven't had the opportunity to fall in love with yet!<br /><br />Now about the movie itself... it's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for Pete's sake.  I'm certain that you don't really need me to review it.  But the Diamond Edition DVD/Blu-ray combo pack does contain an exclusive look at the opening sequence of Walt Disney Pictures \\"The Princess and the Frog.\\"  It also contains some family games as well as various backstage and bonus footage.  It's Snow White... it's a classic... it's worth introducing your kids to.<br /><br />... and all along, my aunt was right to purchase those videos before she needed them.he Frog.\\"   It also contains some family games as well as various backstage and bonus footage.

6305558167|5.0|Of all the Arthurian legend movies, Excalibur is the best. It follows the legend almost to the letter. It is a John Boorman in every way. One of the pleasures about this movie are the many famous stars who are seen in what must have been one of their first roles. Shot before the digital era, what you see is for real. Music score (Carmine Baruna) is hauntingly appropriate for the mood that's set.
B0017HMF6W|2.0|Many have already begun to praise this Blu-Ray, especially Warner´s PR-department. And yes, it certainly has all the obvious advantages of 1080p. If I had nothing to compare with, I probably would have been more pleased. I´m sorry to say this, but I find the colors extremely dull and ugly, and the image quite a bit too dark. Please take a look at the old DVD if you can. It is much brighter (maybe even a bit too much so), but the color palette is definitely much, much warmer in every scene. Just look at Cary Grant´s famous tan. On the DVD it looks like a tan, but on the Blu-Ray, his face looks dirty. And daylight scenes have natural looking blue skies on the DVD; on the Blu-Ray they´re often dark turquoise. Hey, this film is a comedy thriller, not a gloomy drama. I cannot imagine that this Blu-Ray exhibits the hues that Hitchcock wanted. No other color film of his has this murky look, so why should \\"North by Northwest\\" be an exception? Better luck next time, Warner.   And by the way, I have shown the two versions to several friends, and they all agree with me. At least I know now that I´m not the only person on the planet who´s very disappointed with this release. Comments please!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I just got the three season pack of the original series-remastered, and so far I have watched about 9 episodes.  I have to say the remastering is awesome.  They were very tasteful and kept the graphics down to earth, and very 60's looking.  Just nice to see the Enterprise in some more shots than just panning by the screen left to right like it used to be.  So for the remastered version, I give it 5 stars.      As for the packaging of these, I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking.  Very very lame packaging.  There is a cardboard insert in the big plastic box they come in.  Then in the cardboard insert, the DVD's are just in a plastic rack that opens like a flimsy book.  There is no attached labeling to know what DVD is what, but instead they send separate \\"cards\\" that have disk and episode information on them.  It's rather hard to explain the whole configuration, but I just think they could have done something better with the packaging, cause this is just flimsy and clumsy.      Overall, this is a very good set, and I would still recommend it to any Star Trek fan out there that isn't truly hardcore.....meaning if they want to see it exactly as it was in the 60's, then don't buy this set...buy the older set that is just like the originals.  If you want to see the originals, but touched up a bit, and with some neat scenes of the Enterprise and some other misc touchups, then this series is the one for you!
0446892882|5.0|Do you wonder why your teeth are falling out, why you have diabetes, arthritis, heart problems, insanity, cancer, or other health problems? Well look at your candy bar, your sugared coffee, your donut. They are killing you! William Dufty brings out the truth, kicking and screaming for the reader to see. He goes into the history of sugar production, how sugar made armies and empires fall, the reason why certain diseases seem to spread. Sugar! Yep, it's that simple ladies and gents. Mr. Dufty also chronicles his own addiction to the white stuff. He points out that sugar is really a drug...refined as much as cocaine and gasoline, stripped of any nutritional value and pumped into cookies, cakes, canned goods and cigarettes for the mass public to consume on a daily basis. He also shows the reader how certain heroic figures tried valiantly to keep sugar out of almost every single food item now sold in grocery stores. Twisted tales of big food corporations and government meddling are included. It's a very sordid story, and sadly people don't seem to get the big picture, which is - sugar is deadly. Sure, it may take years before the diseases appear, but if you have a high sugar diet, you are probably far from a robust human being.<br /><br />An excellent book!
B000WC3864|2.0|THE EVIL DEAD    (USA - 1982)     Aspect ratio: 1.37:1  Theatrical soundtrack: Mono    Whilst on vacation at an isolated backwoods cabin, five students are terrorized by ancient spirits which possess and kill them, one by one.    Clearly the work of talented filmmakers going places, this OTT gore-fest is alternately loud, excessive, stylish and disgusting, in roughly equal amounts. Debut director Sam Raimi throws everything into the mix, perhaps to atone for a flimsy plot and stock characters (well-played by an excellent cast, including cult-performer-in-the-making Bruce Campbell), and while much of it is tongue-in-cheek, some scenes leapfrog the taste barrier with unconscionable glee (Raimi has since admitted the 'tree rape' sequence was a mistake, for example).     Sadly, the movie is rendered monotonous by its excessive pace and comic insouciance (the sequels - beginning with EVIL DEAD II (1987) - went even further in this direction), and the movie quickly succumbs to the laws of diminishing returns; once you've seen one drooling demon getting its head cut off, you've seen 'em all! Fantastic low budget production values, however, and the makeup effects are dandy.
1569242739|5.0|The GOOD:    - these cupcakes are tasty. i made the peanut butter cupcakes and gobble gobble we ate them in less than 24 hours. yes, that is how my family rolls.  we just cannot help ourselves. i use almond milk because i cannot have soy milk or milk milk currently.  cupcakes still turn out great. i have not tried too many of the recipes though, but i am still glad i bought this book.    The BAD:    - a lot of the recipes call for soy yogurt.  i tasted it and soy yogurt tastes awful. i guess the cupcakes may still turn out okay but i could not try it because it ended up making my baby gassy in the worst way. sigh. so if you are allergic to soy and milk, don't get this book.      The UGLY:    - well my main complaint or rather, what i like least about this book that i actually like A LOT, is that a lot of the recipes ask for soy margarine and shortening.  i only cook with butter or oils because margarine and shortening still gross me out.  i would like this cookbook to offer an oil alternative since they obviously will not use butter.   i like baking with oils because baked goods seem to remain more moist for longer.    OVERALL:    - i still love this book.  i like the way the recipes are laid out, i like the pictures, i am able to substitute real butter for shortening or what not when it asks for it ( i think i have done this already...sorry i'm a tired mom and cannot remember :P )  this is a great buy! book is well-priced to just buy it anyways.

No one could put it down until they were finished. Of course, now we're all anxiously awaiting the next book in the series!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I was 20 when \\"Man in the Box\\" came on MTV (back when it played mostly music), and from that point on I was a die hard fan of AIC. I was in Saudi Arabia doing a tour of duty in the desert and \\"Dirt\\" was the soundtrack of my existence there - it f-ing got me through. Shortly after returning home, I saw AIC on the Lollapalooza tour and nearly suffocated because I had to be up front and watch Cantrell play the guitar. \\"Tripod\\" came out after I left active duty and it was part of my new civilian rebirth.    I have a history with this band. Alice in Chains is woven into my life. Jerry Cantrell has been an influence on my guitar playing. I lived in Seattle until 2002 and saw Mr. Cantrell hanging at the Crocodile, and I might've seen Layne Staley in the U District but never would've recognized him. And when he died I thought, that's the end of Alice in Chains.    But much like Pink Floyd didn't die when Syd Barrett lost his mind, or after Roger Waters quit, 14 years since \\"Tripod\\" we are blessed with a new AIC album, Black Gives Way to Blue.    This CD has not left my stereo since I bought it, except for loaning it to a couple friends who just couldn't believe Alice in Chains was back. From the haunting, goosebump-inducing opener \\"All Secrets Known\\" (a declaration of intent, acknowledgement of legacy, and sonic antenna for the spirit of Layne), to the emotional and personal final track \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\", Cantrell and company prove their right to carry on simply by virtue of their honesty, killer songwriting, and having a lot of relevance to say.    There are songs here so quintessentially Alice in Chains, like \\"Check My Brain\\", \\"Acid Bubble\\", and \\"Lesson Learned\\", that it seems 14 years was merely a hiatus. The sound quality on this album - the production values, if you will - are amazing, with the guitars and drums and layered vocals expanding and enveloping the listener in heavenly sound fields. The songs grab you by the neck, kick you in the crotch, and throw you down till you succumb to the sweet melancholy that comes standard with every AIC album. Unnamed bands that tried to cop the Alice in Chains vibe sound limp and pathetic by comparison 'cause without the actual members of AIC it has no soul.    Yes, Layne Staley was a unique voice that can never be replicated or replaced. That's as it should be. But the three remaining members, plus Jerry Cantrell's co-singer William DuVall, still have something to say as Alice In Chains, and they ensure that \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" honors Layne while moving Alice In Chains forward with ass-kicking conviction, sincerity, and crushing riffs. This isn't a Jerry Cantrell solo album - it's too multi-faceted and energetic to reside next to the slow tempo sludge fests that constitute his solo works.    If \\"Dirt\\" hadn't been such a beginning-to-end masterpiece, the bar wouldn't have been so high for \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\". The ONLY thing that could've made it better is if a cool, sensitive singer with unwordly talent hadn't suffered the disease of heroin addiction.

B0007TKNII|3.0|THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA    (UK/USA - 2004 - color & sepia)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS    France, 1870: The Paris Opera House is haunted by a mysterious figure (Gerard Butler) who tutors a young opera ingénue (Emmy Rossum) and becomes enraged when she falls in love with a handsome nobleman (Patrick Wilson).    Joel Schumacher's long-planned adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ultra-successful stage musical opens with the greatest set-piece of this director's career: A spine-tingling shift from grainy monochrome to saturated color as the timeframe switches from 1919 to 1870, restoring the dilapidated Opera House to its former glory in a swirl of visual effects trickery. It's a powerful moment, one which encapsulates the very essence of this venerable cinematic warhorse. What follows is every bit as sumptuous as the stage show, with a younger cast in familiar roles: Newcomer Rossum is an angelic Christine, beautiful and talented in equal measure, while Wilson shines as her lovestruck admirer, whose dalliance with Christine invites the Phantom's wrath, played with strength and conviction by Butler. Simon Callow and Ciarán Hinds provide comic relief as the Opera's new owners, and there's strong support from Miranda Richardson (the Opera's ballet mistress, bound to the Phantom by more than mere coincidence), Minnie Driver (generously eccentric as the obstinate diva whose monstrous ego and limited talent prove to be her undoing), and veteran Murray Melvin as the frazzled orchestra conductor (a sublime, near-wordless performance).    The film is a spectacle in all senses of the word, designed and photographed to glorious cinematic excess. Webber and Schumacher financed the production independently, so the finished product is true to their respective vision, but while the results are a feast for the senses, it's also compromised in unusual ways: Except for the chandelier sequence and an earlier scene in which the Phantom murders a nosy stagehand (Kevin McNally), Schumacher de-emphasizes the horrific elements of Gaston Leroux's original novel in favor of Gothic visuals (note the Cocteau homage during Christine's first visit to the Phantom's subterranean lair), and he's too quick to reveal the Phantom as a flesh-and-blood creature without any supernatural trappings, which undermines his potency. Those unfamiliar with the stage show may also bristle at the amount of dialogue which is SUNG rather than spoken, draining several crucial scenes of their dramatic urgency, especially during the film's final stretch, though the climactic pay-off is genuinely heartfelt. Romantic, resplendent, defiantly old-fashioned, this 'Phantom' overcomes its minor obstacles to emerge as a triumph in every department.

This album is very near that feat of brilliancy. I love the arrangement of each track, how they flow so well and how the band works in all of the instruments and sounds and tones. I don't want to provide a track by track breakdown/review, I want you to listen and be your own judge.    I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to expand their musical boundaries or if their just curious about Muse, go ahead, buy this album!

I myself do NOT want to see some of these go out with no pride! If you still have it .....rip it!, if not do not become an old act that we just hang on to as if they were still good (Randy Travis anyone?) Do NOT mean to be so critical, but damn, I am spending my money on these cds too!, I am happy for a forum like this and appreciate it!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|People are passionate about Star Trek, and in particular, Kirk and Spock. I get that. I feel it myself, being a fan of The Original Series since my childhood in the 70s (those of you \\"in the know\\" will realize that my screen name bears this out). When I first heard about this project, I reflexively felt that it was going to suck. I felt certain that it was unnecessary, unwise and above all, risky For J.J. Abrams in the extreme. My first thought that it might be something approaching tolerable did not come until I understood that Simon Pegg would be playing Mr. Scott, but even that little enthusiasm was dampened by learning that the original Mr. Spock was making an appearance (???). More and more it sounded like a jumbled mess made by a self-avowed non-fan.<br /><br />And so it was with this preconception and a skeptical outlook that I went to see this movie when it came out. Imagine how stunned I was to learn that in fact, this is a gripping, loving re-imagining of the series that not only retains most of the important elements of the original, but actually improves upon and delves deeper than Star Trek has ever delved before, albeit in somewhat different directions than its creator would likely have gone. To those who say it is not faithful to Gene Roddenberry's vision, I have to say I agree. Unfortunately, I also have to say that when a movie gets made that is 100% faithful to Gene Roddenberry's vision, it ends up being Star Trek The Motion Picture. I therefore patently disagree with the outlook that Star Trek bereft of layers and layers of syrupy self-reflection is not Star Trek at all. Remember that Roddenberry absolutely HATED what they were doing with The Wrath of Khan, arguably the best picture in the series.<br /><br />Well, it WAS arguably the best. Until now. I cannot praise the decisions made by Abrams and his crew enough in every single casting choice. These people could not possibly be better in their respective roles. They seem like a smart young bunch, and that being the case, I'll bet you dollars to donuts they were all, to one degree or another, scared to death of what they were doing. They had every reason to be. But they all pulled it off, to a man (and woman) - nailing the roles and yet each one making it their own. How they managed to do this must owe in great part to Abrams' skillful direction. When the man is tending something, it can be great - the worst Lost moments were when he was distracted, and Cloverfield, well... see what I mean? Chris Pine is to be commended most of all here, his brash portrayal of Kirk is exactly what the character needs... no DEMANDS... without even a HINT of a trace of being a parody of Shatner. I stand in awe of this feat.<br /><br />I stand in awe of this movie. While some disappointing choices were made (I really didn't get the Big Planet Moment, it does kind of look a lot like a smack in the face to purists - and yes, Nero's motivation was weak) nothing can detract from the pure joy of having Star Trek back and on top of its game to the extent that this film has succeeded. In addition, the brilliance of the storyline that takes advantage of Nimoy to veer this series off into an alternate reality not bound to canon is absolutely spectacular. I never saw that coming and it is among the best ideas to be had here. To everyone who has complained that Abrams has turned Star Trek into Star Wars, I'd like you to take a moment to think a bit about that comparison. Star Wars, a franchise run by its creator, makes some prequels - how exactly did that turn out for you? Star Trek is the exact opposite. Its creator is no longer around to bore the socks off of everybody with his \\"vision,\\" and instead, younger, more creative minds have succeeded in making this series more relevant than ever. Cheers to J.J. Abrams. I hope he gets to make a bunch more of these movies.<br /><br />Edit: And of course, I'm being downvoted, I can only assume because I am not being kind enough to the memory ofthe \\"genius\\" of Roddenberry. Whatever, I just tried to be honest. To those of you who value smart entertainment over slavish reverence, get this movie. You'll like it.atever, I just tried to be honest. To those of you who value smart entertainment over slavish reverence, get this movie. You'll like it.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|Let me just start of by saying im the biggest MJ fan out there and this is why it pains me to say this that the \\"This is it\\" is a total cash grab for sony and a major ripoff to loyal fans who are yearning for an entire album of new material.  I can't believe sony even had the nerve to put out another greatest hits collection.  I swear to god if they put out another one next year i will protest in front of their headquarters.  But let me just briefly comment on the album.  Its an album with a bunch of songs that you heard a million times before and of which you probably already own.  Second disc is a few good demo tracks and that luke warm this is it song which sounds like a demo.  Out of all the unreleased songs over the internet this is the one they choose.  Let me just get to the point and say that this is a ripoff and anyone who buys this filth is obviously a gullible delusional idiot or lacking in commonsense.  This is a disgrace to MJ's legacy and career and I just hope that most fans refrain themselves from bying this filth and urge sony to release the dozens of unreleased songs they have in the vault.  If I could I would've given this album no stars at all, GOD I'm so pissed.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO MORE GREATEST HITS ALBUMS DO YOU HEAR ME NO MORE.

B002S0OBFK|1.0|Quite possibly the biggest letdown of the entire year.  What happens when you mix one part hype with one part horror?  88 minutes of snooze with 2 minutes of mild excitement.  I cannot believe that I just dropped $14 in the theater for this garbage.  What baffles me?  An 85% on RottenTomatoes.  Unbelievable.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|So, after the first listen or two, I was thinking this was a solid 3.5 or 4 star album.  After constant listening (because I can't stop), I'm compelled to give it a 5 star without thinking twice.  My justification for the rating has little to do with the musicianship (which it stellar), or the production (which is near-perfect), but has more to do with the fact that this is Emotional music.  Listen to the entire 55 minute suite on Disc 1, and relate the story to \\"incidences\\" in your own life, and if it doesn't move you, you need to check your pulse!
0385737947|5.0|I don't know why, but I saw this book, and without reading the back or anything, I bought it.  It's amazing. It's weird, but in a good way. Once I finished reading I just wanted more.  I read this book in 4 days, which is a record for me....  I'm telling you, you can't get your head out if this book once you start reading it!!!!
0385341008|4.0|I'm so sorry that I did not pace myself better to allow this book to last a little longer.  I sped through it in 2 evenings and don't know what to read tonight!  Juliet is fablulous as are all the characters.  I'm so intrigued with this part of history during and post WWII that I will now be doing my own research and reading more on the topic.  Hard to imagine such isolation during an incredibly historic time and how that impacts a community.<br /><br />I'll be passing my copy on to my friends and family shortly!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|A few observations. Mother Nature's Son sounds like you are sitting next to Paul as he sings. The horns sound brilliant in that song. There is a bit of an unpolished aspect to that song that I have never noticed. The vocals, horns and strings on pretty much every song are bright, crisp, just perfect! I have listened to these songs my whole life and I bought Sgt. Pepper in stereo before listening to this set. Lets not kid ourselves, any version of their music is better than 99% of anything else out there. Notables are The White Album and Revolver. I've always thought Abbey Road is the most solid and consistent album they have but somehow White Album is both their best and worst offering. I'm not into Number 9 and Piggies etc etc but I love Cry Baby Cry, Sadie, Prudence, Mother Nature, Honey Pie, Savoy. Note that Savoy Truffle is so radically different. That was the first song that stuck out when I was scrolling through this album. Everything just rocks my stereo on that song. Sgt. Pepper sounds perfect. I prefer the mono because the stereo separation, particularly with headphones, makes the music less cohesive. This set is the best collection ever created. The packaging is perfect. I agree with a previous reviewer that you should get some jewel cases to put the discs in and leave everything else in tact as a collectors item. I have yet to hear Abbey Road, and my favorite song Here Comes the Sun but that will be the next thing to do. I'm still absorbing some songs that were a hit before I was born, though I was born a long long time ago...Only one complaint. \\"For No One\\" vocals are terrible. Sad, as that is one of my favorites.     Edit 12/05/09: When you buy this set, the first songs to listen to, in order: And your bird can sing, Yesterday, Mother Natures Son, She's Leaving Home, I am the Walrus, Back in the USSR. Not all of the songs sound better in mono (For No One unfortunately!) but the one that I keep going back to is \\"and your bird can sing.\\" The drums and bass come out so much stronger than before. Many reviewers have noted that they sound like a rock band in this set, and this song cements that idea. USSR is a similar example.    Update 11/1/10: I wanted to make a note that I am reading \\"Here, there and everywhere\\" by Geoff Emerick, the record engineer for the Beatles over most of their career, including Sgt. Pepper, for which he won an Grammy for his engineering. In it, he says twice that much more work went into the mono mixes than the stereo mixes. He says specifically that the mono mixes for Revolver and Pepper should be well received by music aficianados. This statement was written prior to the mono set release, so it was not intended to plug the box whatsoever. The book is a fascinating narrative of the happenings of what went on in the recording studio. Reading about how they made Pepper is amazing.
B0009X75RO|5.0|Excellent movie.  Singing and dancing outstanding, serious and funny parts and the actors seem really into their roles. This one I will keep forever.
0307269981|5.0|Book 2 in Larsson's trilogy was even better than the first. Book 1 was slow to start while book 2 throws readers into the action in the first pages and then it never slows down. I cannot wait to sink my teeth into book 3! This is a must read if you like thrilling mysteries, strong, intelligent and mysterious female protagonists and characters who continually fight the corruption that invisibly permeates the most powerful institution in the world!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|As soon as I heard that Patrick Swayze had passed away, this excellent movie came to mind and I added it to my collection.  The acting and the dancing were great and the story rang a bell.  I am old enough to remember when families from the city flocked to the Poconos for summer vacation and to escape the heat of the city for a few weeks.  Love affairs began and ended and friendships were made, sometimes for life.  Patrick Swayze was terrific and this was the movie that brought him the popularity that lasted throughout his career.  It is a classic and one of those movies that one can watch over again from time to time and still enjoy it. Highly recommended.    Anne Meteyard

B001FB4W0W|1.0|I live in rural Colorado and due to our confusing postal issues- we have PO Boxes and no home delivery- I've been leary of ordering online. I should have listened to my inner self. I not only waited WEEKS for this to arrive, but I also never received my package! AMAZON had no way for me to put my billing address (PO BOX) in the order, in addition to my physicaL address so it never delivered. Also, I thought I was buying from AMAZON, but no, I was buying from a seller, who refunded my money before I even knew I couldn't get the package. Moral of story- I will order from Barnes & Noble from now on. They get my packages to my FRONT Porch

1416594787|5.0|In his introduction, Dawkins mentions every book he's written except 'The God Delusion,' which he references only by saying his intention in this book is to present evidence, not attack theology, something he's done before. Unfortunately he doesn't succeed. The book was wonderful. Like all of his others, I learned new things which only contribute to my understanding of that most wonderful theory, something he explains most wonderfuly. It is, however, full of tangents of criticism against his opponents. Personally, I am fully on his side and agree with all said tangents, yet I can't but wonder why he includes them in a book which will obviously only be read by those already of his understanding. A great read, don't get my wrong, but the only times I yawned were during his tirades of which I am so familiar. Write more sir, you constantly enlighten me, but understand who it is who's reading your work. You're preaching to the choir.
B002HNAAZ8|4.0|I've been a huge Danger Danger fan ever since I found a used copy of their debut album thirteen or so years ago.  I've worn out ever album since then, including the awesome \\"Live and Nude\\" album.     So I was very excited when I found out D2 would be recording another album and would be recording it with Ted Poley on vocals. Well, I believe I hyped it up to much in my mind that after my first complete listen... I was a little disappointed. It wasn't bad but it wasn't what I was expecting either.  I'm glad to say I gave it a few more listens since then and it keeps getting better and better.  Yet another great D2 album. It's great to hear Poley again (even though I loved the D2 albums with Laine) and Marcello's guitar work is exceptional.     If you are a fan of Danger Danger, please do yourself a favor and pick this one up. It did take me a few listens to get into it, but once I did, I was hooked.  This one ranks right up there with the first album, Screw It, Four the Hard Way, and The Return of the Great Gildersleeves.      Thank you Danger Danger.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|Frankly, I am price conscience when it comes to HDMI cables - I have a very hard time justifying a $60 (or more) for an HDMI cable. This cable simply works and comes at an attractive price.     Good looking braided cable that feels expensive and will serve your HDMI cable needs. It arrives in Amazon's \\"frustration free\\" packaging which means that it is shipped in a simple brown, recyclable cardboard box (with a little paper outlining the warranty). No plastic to cut, no twist ties to unravel, no added packaging/marketing. Simply open the box, remove the cable, and install it. Easy.    DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL CONNECTION: [...]
B002HWUU1I|3.0|I feel like I am a HUGE Swell Season fan.  However, in my opinion, this album is nowhere near as good as the Once soundtrack or their self titled album.  In the first album, Glen's guitar work blew me away and I didn't get that from this album.  I would still recommend owning it if you are a Swell Season fan but try not to compare it to their first 2 because you will be disappointed.  It's much more mellow, almost too mellow.
B0009UC7QQ|1.0|1.  I can intellectually understand the sentiment that many folks have for this film.  I also understand that this is a movie, a fantasy and not reality.  However, I can \\"believe\\" in the reality of something like... Star Trek compared to this completely odd,  unrealistic,  and basically dumb plot as outlined in the Truman Show.<br /><br />2.  As is the case with most movies, it comes down to the narrative, the story and this story is so unbelievable with so many holes in it, that it really does detract from the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />3.  Bottomline:  If you're someone who tends to think (even a little) while watching movies, then skip this amazing dud.
0375413405|5.0|I purchased this as a gift so I haven't really examined it closely, but the shipping service was excellent.  Thank you.

B002UD56I6|5.0|This movie was awesome !! It was so sad though to see Michael in his last days and you could tell that at times he was dragging (and maybe even drugged). It was nice to see all of the back stage footage instead of just a concert. It showed Michael the man. He is a perfectionist and was involved in all aspects of his concert. The movie shows the kind and gentle soul that was MJ. It is too bad that people shunned him for the last 10 years of his life and vilified him now love him after he is gone. Rest in peace MJ !!
B0002CHIJW|4.0|This film is infamous in many ways.  It has what is believed to be the longest rape scene in movie history (approximately a half hour of brutally graphic violence).    It also features a castration scene that caused many theater goers at the time to throw up.  It has been banned in numerous countries, and most professional movie critics have labeled this film one of the worst ever.  I don't agree at all.    Camille Keaton does a brilliant job playing a rape victim who ultimately gets brutal revenge against her attackers.  The rapists display the worst possible male qualities and do so in a very believable way.  As a male, I found this a bit nauseating. But as part of the film, it is very effective.     The directing and overall cinematography are very well done and (famously) done without a soundtrack.  I believe this is a very important film within the horror genre (although it is more suspenseful than scary) and is also a significant part of film history in general.      The title and cover image for this film seem to portray the movie as a low quality \\"skin flick.\\"  That's not the case at all.  It's extremely graphic and disturbing, but in a artistic and quality way.  Just don't plan on watching it as part of family movie night at your home.  I don't think anybody under the age of 18 should see this film.        Other than the cover image, the DVD presentation is well done and includes trailers, reviews, movie posters, etc.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|1.  This genre isn't my kind of thing, but from time to time, I basically have to watch a film here or there.<br /><br />2.  With the above being said, this film was better than expected.  The acting was pretty good (esp the supporting cast), the overall storyline had some unexpected twists and most importantly, there was a level of maturity typically missing from these types of films.<br /><br />3.  This film should be a definite winner for those who enjoy these types of films and a very pleasant surprise for those who typically resist these types of films.  ie, a good solid film for most folks.
B000ZELISO|1.0|Just to give an example of how inadequate this movie is, the title is \\"the half-blood prince,\\" and it's never fully explained why. They just gloss over it quickly during the rushed finale. Snape says \\"by the way, I'm the half blood prince...\\" wtf? No battle scene or funeral at the end.  They cut so much fundamental material out of the story, it is just unbelievable. Ends like Monty Python and the holy grail, did they run out of money?
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Love it. I wish I would have bought the saga on blu-ray though. Excellent movies. I got this never seeing the last one 'rocky balboa' pretty much assuming it would suck, but I actually enjoyed it until the way they did the final fight, too many lights and angles and shades, almost gonna make someone have a seizure or something.. haha. But it was good.
0307716988|5.0|As I read this book, several times now, I can hear Michael's voice speaking the words to me.  This is like he is your best friend and sharing his thoughts, interests, enthusiams with you.  I loved Jacqueline Onassis' introduction to the book, and pleased that this highly knowledgable woman obviously appreciated the creativity, charm, and intelligence of one of the world's finest entertainers.  She was also not a heavy handed editor, since you do not get \\"her\\" from the book, you get pure Michael Jackson.  It almost has a raw feeling to it, and only a truly gifted editor can reach that peak of achievement.  A tribute to her and to Michael.  I'm glad this gifted, creative editor worked with this gifted, creative artist to give us this tremendous book.<br /><br />From television interviews with MJ that I've seen in recent months, he was much like me and gave different answers to sometimes similar questions, and those answers were what he felt and believed in that moment.  Living in the moment.  I believe this book is a collection of some of his innermost thoughts on life, entertainment, and his own creative path, at the time he wrote it.  What a shame it is that he will not be able to give us a similar reflection as a very old man who's seen and done it all.  We are all the richer for having MOONWALK back in print, but so sad it will be his only book.  I'll certainly be buying more copies this time.  I was appalled to see that in my local library some of the pages had been razored out of their copy.  Beautiful photos.  And I esp liked the \\"sketches\\" done by MJ himself.  QUITE the creative genuis.
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|Love Love Love this movie. Hugh Jackman is great in it, perfect for the role, a few disappointments here and there (mainly what they did to deadpool) but nothing that doesn't give this movie a well deserved 5 stars.
0756405890|3.0|In an episode of SEINFELD, George famously pitched his idea to an NBC executive concerning his premise: A show about nothing. It would be just like everyday life in this show; they would eat, go shopping, read a book. Nothing flashy. Nothing too insane. To me, as I read THE NAME OF THE WIND, this is what was always coming to mind. And, you know what, it's not necessarily a bad thing!<br /><br />The story is about a man who's apparently too powerful for his own good, and has attracted the attention of a well-known scribe. This scribe, Chronicler, wishes to make a book about the life of this very powerful man, Kvothe. Over the course of the book, Kvothe's story is told in first-person and details his life as a young adolescent through to his times at a renowned school called the University.<br /><br />As for this story, I compared it to Seinfeld for good reason. Each chapter reads like \\"a day in the life\\" of Kvothe. Those little aspects of a fantasy hero's day that you wouldn't expect to read about are very prevalent throughout the book. Whether Kvothe's studying for a test, trying to balance his funds, or chatting it up at a pub with his buddies -- it's all here. Which leads me into the actual writing of the book.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is a very competent wordsmith, and his masterful use of language, in and of itself, proves that he will be a mainstay in the fantasy genre for many years to come. Even as I say that THE NAME OF THE WIND will detail some very boring days in Kvothe's life, I will say that I was very rarely bored with it. I am a slow reader, so for an author to keep me going through a 700 page tome...that's an accomplishment. This book was simply a joy to read.<br /><br />The reason that I've scored this book in the average range is because, honestly, this book does not deal with a whole lot. The story is interesting, flows, and is very engaging at times, but it constantly reminds you that this is the first stroke of a much greater portrait of a man; one that is, barely hinted at. I understand that Kvothe is intelligent on an Ender Wiggen-like scale, but it doesn't quite live up to the promise that the synopsis on the back cover details.<br /><br />And, as I said, Kvothe is very much the fantasy archetypal badboy. Any problem that arises, he gets through it eventually. Predicaments are set up so carelessly that it's almost like watching an episode of HOUSE. A problem presents itself, there are a couple setbacks, a misdiagnosis here, but eventually everything will work out. This happened many times. In any given situation in the book, you can expect Kvothe to act exactly how your typical badboy (or Joss Whedon character) would. You just know, as soon as anything devious presents itself, Kvothe will be on the case sooner or later.<br /><br />Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but with such creativity oozing from the book, I expected more from its main character. Note: I love HOUSE and Joss Whedon (Sounds like a nice pairing, huh?).<br /><br />Finally, on the critical but-probably-only-in-my-case side of things, I found almost all of the characters, with the exception of Kvothe, Ambrose and Elodin, to be very similarly characterized. It was very hard to get a clear picture of any of them in my mind, and ended up mixing them up constantly. Kvothe's University friends especially.<br /><br />To wrap things up: I liked THE NAME OF THE WIND. It was a very good debut novel by all means, and a very unique way of viewing a fantasy world. It was a promise that something very grand could be coming our way in DAY TWO, but that's all this book really was to me: a promise of something greater, and a lengthy one at that.I understand that Kvothe is intelligent on an Ender Wiggen-like scale, but it doesn't quite live up to the promise that the synopsis on the back cover details.

B001QWQJ5Q|4.0|Imagine the legendary \\"Flight of the Phoenix,\\" except the crash is on a barren alien planet... and there are nasty flesh-eating monsters. And a serial killer.<br /><br />That describes David Twohy's most artistically adept movie, the raw and dusty \\"Pitch Black. This cult movie starts off as your average gang of embattled, ill-matched castaways struggling to survive, but it that becomes utterly brilliant as it slowly slips from gritty sci-fi to harrowing, claustrophobic horror. And yes, even Vin Diesel gives an awesome performance in this one.<br /><br />After a meteor storm, a sleeper transport crashes on a desolate desert planet. Most of the passengers survive, including a stowaway kid and a dangerous prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel). Unfortunately, it turns out that the entire planet is a desert because it's blasted by three suns all throughout the day, and the survivors have little food, water or shelter. Oh yeah, and Riddick has broken out.<br /><br />To find the necessities, a small group led by Carolyn Fry Radha Mitchell) sets out across the desert -- and discovers a swarm of vicious omnivorous creatures in a cave. Fortunately they can't come out into the light. But when the group finds a geological survey station, they learn that a monthlong eclipse is about to fall over the planet -- meaning the creatures will soon eat them all if they don't escape from the desolate planet, and some of them aren't gonna make it.<br /><br />Personally I haven't liked David Twohy's work except the 1996 sci-fi film \\"Arrival,\\" but \\"Pitch Black\\" is the kind of brilliant cult movie that almost makes up for an otherwise okay-to-bad filmography. This is not a polished space opera, but a dingy, grimy, dirty sci-fi movie full of recognizably ugly technology and stained morals -- not to mention some truly grotesque deaths. And not all of them are from the winged beasties either (think chest impalement).<br /><br />And Twohy gives the movie a very bleak, vaguely disturbing look -- endless chalky deserts filled with bones, grimy ships torn to pieces, empty skies, and searing pale light that makes everyone look half dead. Even the beautiful colourful expanses of space seem vaguely ominous. But the whole thing suddenly becomes jump-in-your-seat scary when the monsters attack, and start eating people as they run.

0739319175|5.0|The story moves at a breathtaking pace, with more twists and turns than you can imagine. Brown has done his research carefully. Who knew there were so many secrets in Washington DC? The voices are all good on the audiodisc, although the hoarse voices of two of the characters sometimes make it difficult to understand them. I listened to it on the car audio, and often went out just to drive around and hear more of the story. OK, maybe he uses too many juicy adjectives and metaphors, but it keeps you in suspense and involved. Nothing will disappoint you here. Brown is a master.
0307473708|4.0|I watched the showtime show before reading this book, so I may be partial to the show (which is just so well done), but the book was very good, very interesting.  The premise is awesome and the content just makes you want to read more.  It's not quite as involved as the show and it's different plot-wise, but definitely worth reading.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Dumas, Stevenson and Conrad are rolling over in their graves while attempting to slap their forehead and asking &#34;Why didn't I write this one?!&#34;<br /><br />The novel starts just prior to the Tokugawa Shogunate and shows how history should be taught.  History is what happens as people live their lives not just a series of dates.  The writing style is along the lines of Louis L'Amour.  I felt like I was there as the action happened.  I could smell and taste the salty sea air.  I could feel the rocking of the ship, etc.  This is one of those huge novels I was afraid to read.  Mainly, because, I was sure that the book would fall apart halfway through and I would lose pages missing some of the action.  And with the Kindle, I can choose the font I'm comfortable reading.  Finally an edition I can read without worrying about destroying the book in the process.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Let me say up front I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I did grow up watching original series re-runs, the tapes of the movies that my father bought, I've seen episodes from across the various spin-off shows and I've read some of the novels here and there so I've got a good working knowledge of the show. Having (like so many) assumed that Star trek was dead after the lack-luster Nemesis and the cancellation of Enterprise (a show that remains underrated in my opinion) I was rather surprised over a year ago when the teaser trailer for this movie popped up before Cloverfield announcing that J.J. Abrams was bringing it back. Having raised my expectations since then I went to a screening last night with hopes for a good Star Trek movie. That in short was what I got and more.<br /><br />To start off with there's the cast. It's never an easy task replacing a well known cast with a new group of actors especially when the cast in question is those of the original Star Trek series but not only has this film done it has done well. I was initially skeptical of Chris Pine as Kirk but Pine not only fills the rather large shoes left before him but fills them admirably and by the end of the movie you have no doubt that he is Captain James T Kirk. In truth that statement can really be applied to the entire cast of \\"new\\" old characters but in particular it can be said of Zachary Quinto as Spock and Simon Pegg as Scotty as both (like Pine) fill some rather large shoes very nicely indeed. There's also a nice (if underused) villain in the form of Eric Bana as Nero plus a fantastic supporting cast including the ever excellent Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike plus Ben Cross and a woefully underused Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. And then there's the return of Leonard Nimoy to the role that made him famous in some of the best and most unexpected scenes of the movie. In short it's one of the best Star Trek casts ever and the best for a feature film (in my opinion) since The Undiscovered Country.<br /><br />This Trek has also got some really good production values in fact they put other Trek films to shame. The set designs have echoes of what we know from the original series but give a nice modern feel to them and this is especially true of the bridge of the Enterprise itself. The film's CGI is (in two words I use very infrequently) awe-inspiring on the big screen especially when it comes to the various ships sued in the film but especially of the Enterprise which (on the outside) looks like a perfect meshing of both the original TV series ship and the one used in the original series cast movies. In fact if one can find nothing else to say about this film it is that it has the best special effects in the history of Star Trek to date.<br /><br />The film is an action film by any definition of that phrase. From the opening teaser sequence right thru to the end the film is full of space battles, sword fights and fist fights. The fights are all well staged and put similar sequences in the two most recent Trek films to shame. The space battles, thanks to the excellent CGI mentioned above, also come across as the best yet done for Star Trek as whole (or at least what I've seen of it). Yet while this might be an action film it hasn't lost what makes Star Trek so good to begin with.<br /><br />That would be story. In what can be called increasingly rare in the Hollywood action movie the writers actually take the time to explore character development. This is especially true of the background and early years of Kirk and Spock. In fact it is the journey of these two young men whose destines has always been intertwined that forms the emotional center of this movie. Spock, always seen as the logical being, gets some emotional material in this film unlike we've seen in Star Trek prior to this point with that character (at least since he died but as they say that's another movie all together). That really brings us to the Nimoy scenes and the stick issue of continuity.<br /><br />As I said I'm not a die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me the following. While this film features the original group of characters from the original series they're different versions of them. This is thanks to one of the tried and true plot devices of Star Trek: time travel and interference with the past. That said the interference causes a lot of changes from the subtle to moments where I can see some going \\"blasphemy on the alter of Roddenberry!\\" In particular there's two plot points (one of them being a relationship) which might do that but for those of us who realize (as the movie itself says) that the past has been altered and this is a new time-line it shouldn't be anything too upsetting and if fact it makes for some fascinating viewing. The film is also full of nice little references to various Trek stories of the past especially the best of the Trek films The Wrath of Khan. The scenes with Nimoy (including the most impressive Vulcan mind meld I've ever seen) illustrate this point beautifully: this is the end of the beginning (albeit a forty plus year beginning) and the start of a whole new Trek (no pun intended).<br /><br />Another aspect that brings the point of this being both an ending and a new beginning is the score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek has always been known for some nice film score and this film is no exception to the rule. The score is bombastic when it needs to be and personal when it needs to be. Giacchino also makes very sparing use of the classic Star Trek theme itself (something done wisely by David Arnold with the James Bond Theme in Casino Royale) until the end credits to let the audience know for certain that while things might have changed this is still Star Trek. It might be on the same level as the Goldsmith or Horner scores of previous films but this is still a Trek score and a fine one at that.<br /><br />If this new Star Trek movie is any indication there's a life for this little TV series after all. With a fine cast, well designed sets, fantastic CGI work, well staged action, nice scripting and good music I can say one thing for certain. If this is the future of Star Trek then may this new Trek live long and prosper.die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me the following.

0452286751|5.0|The Fountainhead is about Howard Roark and his struggles as an architect. Roark combats a successful rival architect, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. In the Fountainhead Rand addresses several issues: individual strength, good versus evil, and the threat of fascism. The combination of the underlying themes and Rand's amazing writing makes the book entertaining and influential.<br /><br />After being amazed by Ayn Rand's writing and storytelling from Atlas Shrugged I looked for more books from Rand. My search brought me to The Fountainhead. I was once again carried away by a brilliant story.  I look forward to reading more from Ayn Rand.  I highly recommend Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I have a lot of exercise viedos, but I wanted something that I knew would be specific to pregancy.  This video answered my quest for a pregancy workout.  I try to work out everyday.  I walk, do videos, lift weights, and a little jogging.  I wanted a quick workout I could do when it was raining or bad weather.  This is a great workout for pregant women because the trainer is pregnant and gives you excerises that will help you with the pregancy.  The video can be a little corny at times, but overall it is a quick way to get a workout in and also prepare you for childbirth.  I would not say the workout is hard, but I would not say it is easy either.  She gives you variations so that you can make the workout harder or easier (depending on your fitness level, or just your day).  She works through all the target areas.  The video has a parnter workout section, I have never watched or completed that section so I cannot comment on that portion.  The trainer is very informed and easy to follow.  You do not need extra equipment or a lot of room to do this video.
1594481717|5.0|Fifty years ago the advice to young people was to get a good education in one of the professional fields and you would always be able to get a good job, earn a living and support your family.<br /><br />Fifty years ago, the \\"society was built on logical, linear, computer like capabilities\\" -  capabilities that were left brain focused.<br /><br />According to the author Daniel Pink, there has been a major shift in how the world works.  The mainstay of the economic engine a few years ago - \\"knowledge workers\\" - is being replaced.<br /><br />Those things that are logical and linear are now being done in Asia.  What was once the prestige occupations in the US are now commodity functions and can be done in Asia much cheaper.<br /><br />The book starts off with a short lesson on the way the brain works.  Then the author traces the rise and eventual decline in knowledge workers and the implications.<br /><br />As we enter the Conceptual Age, we will be more concerned with feelings and experience than with material things. This gives more importance to the right brain directed activities.<br /><br />He then discusses what he calls the \\"six essential right brain directed aptitudes: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning.<br /><br />Pink makes a very compelling case that we are moving away from the focus on accumulating more material things to a focus on more meaning in life.  If you expect to succeed in this new world, you will need to become more in tune with the High Concept - High Touch way.  \\"Meaning is the new money\\".<br /><br />A very important work that looks ahead rather than toward the past and gives us a good sense of where to focus our efforts.<br /><br />A very thought provoking work.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Sons of Anarchy was a great show to watch. Cant wait until Season 2 is available!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|It's been awhile since I have found a \\"new\\" show on TV I like. So admittedly, I am a late-comer to How I Met Your Mother. I just recently started watching in 2009. After watching a few episodes and being really intrigued, I decided I had to watch from the beginning with Season 1.    As I got more familiar with the characters, I came to appreciate just how perfectly the show was cast. The characters are all unique in their own way and their quirky friendships with each other feel genuine. Their interaction feels so familiar, like it's the way I interact with my own friends. Of course I don't meet with friends in the bar below my apartment every night, so it's not exactly the same..    Ok, moving on, another reason I really like the show is the main character, Ted (Josh Radnor), is an actor I have never seen in anything else before. So I have no preconceived notions about him, which makes his character more believable. It's kind of annoying how a lot of shows recycle the same actors from previous shows. It's hard to let go of those character's personalities and quirks from other shows. Anyway, Ted is a neurotic buffoon obsessed with finding the right girl and getting married. He's so honest and geniune but has a knack for scaring girls off for those very reasons. It's fun to watch as he struggles to find love, as his diverse group of friends take turns encouraging and discouraging him.    Now that I have said all that, I have to contradict myself. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris, from Doogie Howser and some other movies) is amazing on this show. It's incredible how he is morphed into this ultra cool guy the last several years after being a geeky boy genius in the late 80s, early 90s. But although his character is ridiculously over-the-top sometimes, he really resonates with me. There's always a guy just like him in every group of friends. The womanizing, cocky, condescending ass who always has a plan. Without him, no one ever goes to the club or on crazy adventures. So let me say now that its ok for supporting characters to be recycled as long as they re-invent themselves. And I will conclude by saying that I love Season 1 of How I Met Your Mother and strongly urge to watch it as soon as humanly possible if you have not yet.

0061730327|5.0|This is a wonderful, inspiring, well-written story about William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery.      The book spends alot of time on William's background (which, in itself, is interesting).  He lives in a dirt poor country, with a corrupt government.  William's family are farmers,  On good years, the family grows enough food to sustain them throughout the year.  Often there is some left, which can be sold at market.  This money is what pays for school.  William is determined to get his education and not become a farmer.  In 2003, a drought struck, causing a famine, in which many people died.  William had to drop out of school but still remained determined to learn.  He walked to the library & discovered a book on windmills, then a book on energy.  He taught himself how to build and power a windmill.    His windmill was made of scrap materials found around the village.  By the time he was done, he had lights in his home, this was a first.  Until now, the family would use kerosine lamps, which emitted alot of smoke.      After hearing stories about a boy with a windmill, a reporter came to the village.  His story then began to circulate over the internet.  He now has sponsers, a scholarship to college & speaking tours.  His house now has a well, for water, which his family shares with the village & is professionally wired & lighted.

B001W63DX2|5.0|I bought this dvd not only out of interest in learning more about Iron Maiden, but also based on the strength of the other Banger Production films, \\"Metal: A Headbanger's Journey,\\" and \\"Global Metal.\\"  I wasn't disappointed on either count.    This is a good-natured documentary of the Somewhere Back in Time tour.  There's no tension or drama a la Metallica's \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" or Wilco's \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart.\\"  These guys seem to really enjoy their music, their lives, and each other.  There is NOTHING old or tired about them, and that makes watching them for an hour and forty minutes pure fun.    Writer/director Sam Dunn tells us at the beginning of the film that Maiden is his favorite band.  He and Scot McFadyn have paid the band an immense tribute with this film.  It is well-executed and enjoyable from start to finish.  Excellent.

141041986X|5.0|I'm awe inspired by Suzanne Collins talent.  She had me before the first page was read.  The anticipation leading up to the `games' was intoxicating making me abandon duties, family, and life.  There was no let down; the payoff was brilliant and the anticipation worth it.  I found myself, angry, frustrated, teary, excited, scared, hopeful, multiple times each.  Granted the concept isn't new but the author's version stands impressively high.    It's a rare book when you can get this attached to the characters.  Characters you love, root for and don't want to throw the book because of how stupid and whiny they are.  Finally a strong female that kicks butt all by herself.  Spunk is an understatement.  She knows when to hide emotion, and when to cry for real reasons.  She has compassion, empathy, charity, but also knows when it's time to kill, and continues to hold onto her humanity in horrific circumstances.  I think I have a new hero.    You know a book has made an impression when you drive people crazy with talk about it.  Even further when you finally put it down to get some sleep and your dreams are filled with post apocalyptic games of survival until the morning comes when you can read again.  I can't remember the last book that had me this obsessed, trying to find any waking moment to read, and angry when I'm interrupted. Bravo Suzanne Collins, Bravo.    J.B. Fisher author of Sunset and Enigma

0385504225|3.0|This book has too many words -- WAY TOO MANY WORDS.  It is clear from the outset that this was written to be a screen play and each of the chapters was intended to be \\"shot\\".  But I did read the book in its entirety so I gave it three stars.  I read Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and really enjoyed it even though it was clear the heavy lifting had been done in the book \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\".  Brown followed that up with \\"Angels and Demons\\" which seemed to be based on tour guides of Rome and Vatican City.  That book actually expected the reader to believe that Langdon could zip around Rome in minutes.  Anyone who has ever been in Rome and seen the traffic knows how ridiculous that is, but it is a work of fiction.  Not as good as Da Vinci Code but still enjoyable and now we have \\"The Lost Symbol\\" which seems to have been based on a Discovery Channel Documentary with an eye on the next movie that is sure to result.  So what about this novel pretending to be something other than a screen play?<br /><br />This has Langdon zipping around Washington D.C but unlike his previous outings where he was a major leader of the mystery, in this book his role seems to be that of a confused bystander watching events unfold around him.  His major contribution seems to be to explain the latest \\"symbol\\" while stating with a sense of discovery \\"But that's a Myth\\" followed by \\"I am only interested in Peter Solomon\\".  He is then whisked by events -- usually out of his control -- to the next symbol, while being out smarted at every turn by the antagonist.  Brown does spice up the plot with what he hopes are a couple of red herrings which will certainly play well in the movie.  But there are whole sections here that add little to the plot and the chapters are burdened with unnecessary descriptions of the geography and Masonic practice and belief.<br /><br />I bought the book.  I read the book.  I will probably see the movie.  But Brown will have to do better in his next book.  Maybe he should take on Sasquatch, UFO's, or Captain Kidd's Treasure, I'm sure the Discovery Channel has something that he can use for a plot.tch, UFO's, or Captain Kidd's Treasure, I'm sure the Discovery Channel has something that he can use for a plot.

B002DZX96C|4.0|I'm fond of Alfred Brendel's Schubert, Haydn and Mozart so when I had the opportunity to pick up this newly reissued set of Beethoven sonatas for just over $30 from an Amazon reseller, I grabbed it. Since I've spent thirty-plus years with the Arrau cycle, starting with the LP's, and also had the Schnabel set in my library, I admit that I have fairly fixed ideas about what the Beethoven sonatas should sound like. Arrau, born in Chile but for the most part trained in Germany, is often called cold, detached and analytical (i.e. \\"Germanic\\") in the studio; but I think this is dead wrong. His identification with the mythic-heroic elements in Beethoven is reflected in his playing, which is full of emotional depth - sometimes so much so that it is almost difficult to listen to. Brendel, too, is often referred to as an intellectual pianist, which I suppose implies that his playing lacks emotional depth; but after listening to his survey of Beethoven sonatas, I think this assessment is also wrong. It's true that Brendel may not project the same level of suffering that Arrau sometimes finds in these scores (and this may be a relief at times), nor does he reach the celestial heights scaled by Arrau; he instead, however, favors structure and the working out of various ideas, which doesn't make him any less Beethovenian. Perhaps the best way to differentiate the two is to describe Arrau's orientation as \\"Romantic\\" whereas Brendel is more of a \\"Classicist.\\"<br /><br />There are many moments in these sonatas where Brendel's playing seems scaled down compared to Arrau's and you often end up thinking he's missed an opportunity to make a statement. Arrau, on the other hand, has often been accused of excessive point-making; and while Brendel too can belabor a point, he doesn't often go to Arrau's length. But it is in the process of reaching for the stars that Arrau, who may occasionally reach too far, reveals more of Beethoven's conflicted/spiritual aspects and no doubt, more of himself as well.<br /><br />The sound-world of these pianists also comes into play. Arrau is plush and organ-like and while very modern in his playing still incorporates rhetorical flourishes that are reminiscent of the 19th century giants from whom he descended (Arrau's only teacher was Martin Krause, the last pupil of Liszt). This is especially evident in his traversal of the late sonatas, which to my way of thinking, has never been surpassed. Brendel is more compact, if not austere, in his playing which has a bell-like ring to it (if you could call him a descendant of anyone, it would be Kempff). Sometimes he makes a clipped ratta-tat-tat sound, as in the rondo of the Waldstein sonata, where Arrau's pianistic finish is just more sophisticated. And there is a tendency toward the finicky that can be bothersome (opp. 7 and 28 are representative). Yet Brendel's playing can also have an unsettling rattling element which makes his performance of the Moonlight sonata one of the best I've heard. This same rattling effect can be heard in the Tempest sonata, which is also excellent.<br /><br />Let me say that I was prepared to be disappointed from the outset after listening to the first two sonatas (op. 2 nos. 1 & 2), which are missing the joy of early Beethoven and lend credence to the \\"cerebral\\" label so often attached to Brendel. Certainly these sonatas are well thought out, perhaps even a little too well thought out as they have a calculated feel to them. Opus 2, no. 3, on the other hand, sparkles. There are ups and downs from this point on as not everything is equally inspired - indeed, there is no ideal set of Beethoven sonatas. Sonatas no. 5 and 6 are from recitals and both succeed very well (too bad the applause wasn't edited out though). And Brendel really shines in the two op. 14 sonatas and also in op. 22. Perhaps his matter-of-fact treatment of the funeral march from the the op. 26 sonata is a little lightweight, missing the gravitas that Arrau brings to it. Missingtoo is the contrast that Arrau draws between this movement and the sunlit finale. His insistent finding and/or infusion of meaning is in contrast to Brendel's more straightforward approach, which doesn't lack imagination but sometimes just doesn't reach the same high level of inspiration. A case in point is the second movement of the thirteenth sonata, one of my favorites, which Brendel efficiently dispatches, but which the visionary Arrau transforms into a statement of kaleidoscopic proportions. There is simply no comparison between the two. Having said that, let me point out that Brendel is far from superficial - in fact, his sonatas are for the most part well balanced and sometimes can be a refreshing tonic to Arrau's persistent inwardness.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by Brendel's readings of the late sonatas. The Hammerklavier, recorded live(!), is outstanding, as is his reading of op. 101. He also turns in a fine op. 111, sounding, in fact, very much like Arrau. I was less taken with op. 109 where some of the phrasing is too plain - but I recall Harris Goldsmith calling Arrau's phrasing in the late sonatas \\"Furtwanglerish\\" (which was meant to be a pejorative) and even though his readings may border on overstatement, to me they are infused with an epic grandeur that has never been equaled.<br /><br />In summary, if you are looking for a Beethoven cycle in digital sound that reflects the Kempff style of playing, then you'll be satisfied with Brendel.Arrau draws between this movement and the sunlit finale.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I watched the entire first season and loved every episode. I, unfortunately, don't have the channel that this show premiers on now that I'm in college. I hope they put the second season on the official site like they did with the first season.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the producers earlier TV shows: Hercules and Xena: The Warrior Princess. I believe I like The Seeker even better though. The cinematography and tone of the series is amazing. In his previous series he had quit a lot of comedy in them. The Seeker is darker and for fantastical.<br /><br />Definitely worth adding to any movie collection.
B002KAJ0AO|4.0|Being long-time fan, I am in agreement with 3 or 4 star rating. This is an okay standard album for them, no Millennium, but it's hard to compare with being on top. Glad they are still together. Favorite cut is 'All of Your Life'. AJ does a great job on 'If I Knew Then', 'Masquerade' is pretty standard BSB, 'PDA' is just stupid. I will still buy their albums.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Lots of bonus footage and deleted scenes. Worth the money if you are a true fan!
B001UV4XTC|3.0|Larry Gopnik is a middle aged man living in the 1967 American Midwest, with a simple, but familiar life routine. His faith, job, and family define his place in the community. It may be not much, but it is all he's got... One day however, he finds this routine deeply interrupted: his wife asks him for a divorce; his job is threatened by poison pen letters; his brilliant, but socially dysfunctional brother moves in with him, unable to hold down a job. And from there, things get worse... Larry subconsciously reaches out to people around him for help (once by having a panic attack in his lawyers office), only to be referred to a rabbi. And then to another one, and another one...<br /><br />I read somewhere an opinion that A Serious Man was too esoteric to earn a wide audience following. I want to assure you that is NOT a reason NOT to see the film. I think one universal truth about humans is that, regardless of our individual religious affiliations, we all seek deeper meaning to our lives, past paying our mortgage and taxes... The various rabbis the hero seeks out in order to help him make sense of his trials and tribulations may as well be imams or catholic priests. Larry's quest for the meaning to his suffering is akin to what most of us go thru at some point... All of which makes him a sympathetic character. The story, as told by the brothers Coen, is witty and engaging; the lessons are true and wise. Be ready for little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought. This is definitely a film best appreciated when one is in a ruminative mood. However, the lessons could as well be told in three sentences or less, rather then an hour and twenty five minutes of film. If you are a linear thinker, you may find the pace of the story frustrating.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|OK. If you're like me, who own every single album of MJ music, and have all his songs, then you MUST have MJ's \\"THIS IS IT\\"!  It is worth every penny. The booklet is beautifully designed and composed. It just shows how much MJ respected and loved his fans, he always wanted for us to have the best of HIM.  When I listened to the first track on disc 2, I became litterally speechless and tears just automatically filled up my eye sockets. OMG, that's all I can say. You have to get the CD and experience it yourself. Michael Jackson is truely the ultimate entertainer of our time. His music and soul are so beautiful, so genuine, so gigantic that overwhelm you, but at the same time you feel you cannot get enough of HIM.  MJ, you're still the THRILLER!     I want to add an extra note on \\"This Is It\\". Like most of MJ fans, I hate Sony for the way they treated MJ in the past (but I think that period of time got a lot to do with Tommy Mottola). However, I got to give kudos to Sony for the way they technically handled \\"This Is It\\".  The quality of the sound and mixing techniques is SUPERB!  This time around, (putting MJ's angelic vocal aside) the sound engineering on each track is so great that I feel like listening to those songs for the first time. Kudos to whoever did the sound engineering for \\"This Is It\\". MJ would have been very happy and proud!
B0027REDK2|4.0|So I bought this for the demo of \\"The Chauffeur,\\" and I was not disappointed. I also loved the release of \\"Like An Angel,\\" but was horrified by the demo of the same (WHAT was with the backing vocals?) As for the rest, I could not really tell it was all \\"digitally remastered,\\" and the UK versions were different from the US version literally by seconds. All in all, though, I was pleased.<br />As a fan of Andy Taylor, it was interesting to me to hear how much more the guitar was prevalent on the four Manchester Square demos. I was also intrigued (listening to the songs on my iPod,) by the use of mono versus stereo on \\"New Religion.\\"<br />I recommend for every fan. I'd also recommend this CD above the regular \\"Rio\\" CD. I look forward to (we can only hope!) the \\"Collectors Edition\\" SATRT .... from all I have heard, THOSE are the demos I want to OWN!
0743297334|4.0|I've read the majority of Hemingway's books and this is the only one I return to.  It has a great deal of atmosphere and always gives me a taste of what post-WWI life was like among a certain set of worldly adventurers.  I feel like I'm along for the ride when Jake goes fishing or to the bullfights, and Hemingway makes me taste the cold beer Jake drinks in the heat of the day.  At the end though, I feel a certain distaste for the maneater Brett and also Jake, because he's so taken with this ultimately shallow woman.  Is this a great book:  no, but \\"isn't it pretty to think so.\\"  It's just very good.  I would recommend to anyone who likes Hemingway another American writer named James Salter who is celebrated but not nearly as much as Hemingway.  For my money, Salter out-Hemingway's Hemingway.
B0011Z3334|5.0|I was introduced to Paramore via \\"That's What you Get\\" on Rock Band 2 for the PS3. I really liked that song so I looked into getting more Paramore. When I previewed their mp3s it turned out that all the songs I liked the best are on this album. It's really a great one.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|It was midnight Oct.27, 2009 and i saw this movie. It is great and i would love to see it again and again, so i'll be one-of-the first to buy the dvd. What an entertainer he was and still is to me.       Dianna Lynn Elmore
B002R0EIVI|5.0|since this is created from reheresal footage, it's a little rough but also polished making it all the more interesting.  watching each song being staged & then seeing a full performance is fascinating.    the film meets all expectations, well done & highly recommended.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|This is it... are you serious? It should be more like the way it was. Because all the songs except for the demo's are all from previous albums. They could have at least put in this album from what was actually in the movie. I am sure they have the full recordings somewhere... Michael's voice was much deeper and sound I think better because it was his actual voice and not something remastered. Very very disappointed. I probably will not but the album now that I know it isn't what it's supposed to be. RIP MICHAEL!!!!
0743298039|3.0|Seriously, I can't believe all the stellar reviews.  The book is fine-- lots of twists and turns, but way too long and all the little snippets and hints are laboriously pointed out within the book.  Heavyhanded and contrived are good words to describe the book-- doesn't mean it's a total waste, just not a work of note.  It's also kind of annoying in how hard it tries to pull together all the strings of the story.  .  And I am SO tired of authors dropping titles like \\"Jane Eyre\\" in their novels, as if hoping that the genius of the former somehow rubs off on the latter.  It doesn't.  It makes you sound 13.  I definitely didn't lose myself in this one.  I honestly would have stopped reading it if it wasn't for the fact that my book club was reading it.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This GPS receiver works great connected to my netbook using Microsoft Streets and Trips. No complaints! I recommend getting one!!!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|As others have said, the discs come in cheap trays that prone to breaking (several of them were broken when I received the set) and the trays are held together by nothing more than packing tape which the trays have a tendency to separate from. For the price of a brand new set, one would think the spartan packaging could have been upgraded.<br /><br />But, the series is great and anyone looking to buy this set already knows that.
B001GCUO16|5.0|It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase \\"summer movie.\\" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action.  But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that  mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action is just plain spectacular.     One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't \\"talk down\\"  to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.    This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine.  People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it. I saw it with two people that have never seen any X-Men stuff and they loved it. One of the year's best. It's A complete movie that flows so very well.
B002H3F7F6|2.0|I had great hopes for Sting's X-Mas CD. It seemed like a natural, and could have been a grand-slam. He's already recorded a slew of X-Mas music; the sublime Gabriel's Message, a beautiful Ave Maria with Dominick, Panis Angelicus(sp?) with Pavarotti, Do They Know... on which he's the highlight, a nice I Saw Three Ships. Sting used to be able to sing the phone book, but this is, like his two previous efforts(Sacred Love and the lute record) painfully boring and disappointing. We can only hope that he can return to form one day as Bruce Springsteen has come reasonably close to doing. I'll be pulling for him. He's one of The Greats. Just not right now.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Good:  I tried out this headset the moment it was released.  I figured something with 7.1 surround sound would be awesome--and quite frankly, it is!  The sound is great, and makes playing games like Call of Duty or Halo much more interesting.  I can hear their footsteps!  The cushioning of the headset, both the top and on each ear, is comfortable.  I won't have my ears being cut off from oxygen, because the cushioning itself breaths.  I recommend people to buy this, despite the cost.    The Bad:  Sometimes, not often, you'll hear static and the occasional sounds like your ears are popping.  It'll go away after a couple minutes or more, but I still hate when it occurs.  The batteries are only AAA, so find something that stores a lot of power, otherwise you'll be changing out batteries constantly (that is, if you're a major gamer).  Another minor complaint, is that I wished the headset wouldn't require a cord going from the headset, to your Xbox360 controller, in order to have voice communications.      The Verdict:  A great buy.  Keeps the noises of my speakers from destroying the walls in my house, and lets people sleep in peace while I enjoy my video games, and even movies!  Once you get used to the occasional static and battery changing, it'll be a great experience in the long run.
B002JTHFV2|5.0|This is a review of the 2009 Deluxe Edition (2CDs) of U2's The Unforgettable Fire.          As a college DJ, I was one of the first Americans exposed to, and to play, the music of U2 when their debut album Boy was released in 1980.  That album, together with their third album, War, cemented U2's status as a major rock band.  But it was their next studio album, The Unforgettable Fire, that catapulted U2 to superstar status.  The experimental nature of U2's first of many collaborations with producer Brian Eno and engineer Daniel Lanois and the strong songwriting on the album, together with a growing awareness that U2 was a unique, politically conscious band, gave U2 a special cache and took them to another level.  The following year, U2 was one of the most highly anticipated acts at the 1985 Live Aid concert, and their follow-up studio album, The Joshua Tree, was probably the best album of the 1980s.  The groundwork for that masterpiece, however, can be found on The Unforgettable Fire.     Unlike U2's prior, more straightforward, work, The Unforgettable Fire had an atmospheric feel to it, undoubtedly as a result of Brian Eno's involvement.  I always felt, however, that the album sounded somewhat muddy, and the initial CD release of the album certainly was.  This new re-mastering cleans up the sound without compromising the atmospheric feeling that pervades the album.  The album has probably never sounded better than it does here.  Larry Mullin's drums, Adam Clayton's bass, the Edge's guitar and Bono's voice just leap from the speakers.   The albums closing song, MLK, is just phenomenal.       The second bonus disc is not too shabby either.  It includes various B sides and outtakes, including all of the Wide Awake in America EP.  That EP's \\"live\\" versions of Bad and A Sort Of Homecoming are actually superior to the studio versions, and they sound terrific on this new re-mastering.  The second disk also includes a cameo appearance by Peter Gabriel on another version ofA Sort Of Homecoming.  .  The Deluxe version is very nicely packaged in the same manner as U2's prior \\"deluxe\\" releases (The Joshua Tree, Boy, October, War and Under A Blood Red Sky).  The CDs are housed in a booklet that contains the lyrics to the songs on the original album as well as some nice pictures and essays by Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Bert van de Kamp (commenting on the album) and the Edge (commenting on the bonus material).    So is the deluxe version worth ponying up the dough if you already own copies of the music?  That depends on how big a U2 fan you are.  There is no doubting that this is a nicely packaged much better sounding version of a classic album with some excellent and some interesting bonus material.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This box set is spendy; however, the sound is terrific and if you were to buy each one separately, in the long run, it's more economical to purchase the box set.  I have not yet purchased the mono set.  I am happy with this sound set so far.  Being a teenager in the 60's brings back a lot of fond memories for me.
B000077VR3|4.0|So, I saw this movie for the first time with some friends about 3 years ago, and I have to admit that I didn't like it. I was mad at the ending. But, I found that I kept thinking about the story. Life was busy, so about a year later I rented the movie, to see if I was remembering it correctly and if I liked it. Same thing. And now, 2 years later... I finally bought it. And, I have to admit that I really do like this movie, but it's different. It's eccentric. It's beautiful. And crazy. And funny. And very romantic. The story underneath everything is so beautiful.    And, I just have to say that it's beautiful because we, as women, but also as human beings (male and female alike) were made to love like this. Love deeply, wholly, passionately. That doesn't always happen in life, sadly. But nonetheless, that's what our hearts long for. \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\\" How true.     ps... there's also a song that fits that quote. It's \\"Made to Love\\" by tobyMac.     I wouldn't recommend this movie for kids, mostly just because of the first few scenes. She is a prostitute in a brothel/night club after all. But, the story is one you'll remember for sure. (But, it's because of those scenes and because of the eccentricness of the movie at times that I make it a 4. Some people probably won't like it)

B00009RDGA|5.0|Paper Moon, directed by Joe Bogdanovich and adapted from the novel Addie Pray by Joe Brown, is one of my favorite movies. It manages to be funny and serious at the same time. I've seen it four times and I don't think I'll ever get bored with it. The humor and acting is timeless.<br /><br />Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) loses her mother during the Great Depression. When Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal), an old friend of her mother's, arrives in town for the funeral he reluctantly receives the task of making sure Addie gets to her aunt's house in Missouri. Addie tags along with Moses while he swindles widows and others out of their money and shows him that she can be just as deceptive as he can. Along the way Moses picks up a lady friend named Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn) and her maid Imogene (P.J. Johnson).<br /><br />Tatum is absolutely marvelous as Addie. This is the best performance I've seen from a child actor. She is funny, intelligent and headstrong. She refuses to leave Moses' side until she gets her two hundred dollars back from him. I still can't believe that Tatum was only ten when she took on the role. Her facial expressions through out the movie are hilarious. It's remarkable how well she acted at such a young age. She certainly gives her more experienced father a run for his money. Her performance is by far the best in the entire film.<br /><br />Kahn and Ryan also give stellar performances. Kahn is spectacular as an exotic dancer who tries to appear as innocent as possible. Her best scene takes place on the hill when Addie refuses to get back in the car. She is funny and heartbreaking. It's no wonder she's one of the funniest comedic actresses of all time (in my opinion). Ryan shows the audience that Moses may be a con man but he still cares about Addie, a girl he hardly knows. He brings out the human side of his character.<br /><br />The cinematography is great. The decision to make the film black and white really allows me to suspend belief. I can truly imagine that the movie was shot in the 1930s. The scenic shots of the countryside are also beautiful.<br /><br />There are many scenes in the movie that audiences won't forget. The money exchanging scene done by Moses and the hill scene with Madeline Kahn and Tatum O'Neal are two that come to mind. There are also plenty of one liners that are hilarious; every character has terrific lines.<br /><br />Paper Moon is a film that, once you watch, you won't forget. It's a film that you can watch over and over and always find something new to laugh at. I highly recommend this movie.he 1930s. The scenic shots of the countryside are also beautiful.

B002JTHFUS|3.0|this album was a huge letdown for me...    i was expecting a lot more from this after 'war' came out..    i think the production values and the recording engineer  softened their sound too much, this album was just not  up to their standards.    yeah, it had a few good songs on it, like the 'unforgettable fire',  classic U2, but the rest was hit and miss, and 'pride' was just  another typical song for its time..    u2 had really lost the mark by this album, and would fall even  further with the 'joshua tree', which i personally cant stand,  and at that point i gave up on how commercial they had become..    its too bad, because they really could have kept going, and made  even better songs and albums, but everything had become hit and miss.    well, back to this package, yes, its nice to have the b-sides, and the  extra tracks, i like the dvd disc too, because i can replace the laserdiscs  of it..    but in the end, its too little, too late..
B00002SSRZ|1.0|This is one of Santana's greatest albums so it is a true shame that it was put out in such a poor version.

I actually prefer to listen to my cd copy and never play the DTS. A total waste of money and a true shame because it could have been great...

I feel privileged to watch this great musician develop right before my eyes.<br /><br />(No, I don't work for the guy. :P )<br /><br />It's just that in the electronic music scene it's rare to see someone deliberately create music that sounds like no one else's- everybody wants to sound like \\"whatever's big at the moment\\". Deadmau5 takes risks, and Deadmau5 aims to create music that will make you say \\"That's gotta be Deadmau5 I'm hearing, or someone who sounds a lot like him.\\" He imitates nothing. And consequently HE becomes \\"whatever's big at the moment.\\"<br /><br />\\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" is, for tracks 1-10, one piece and one project, not a collection of individual songs. Starting with the well-spiced opener \\"FML\\", the lineup includes two mixes of \\"Ghosts N Stuff\\"- and one of them is the Rob Swire vocal version. Yes. If you never liked it before try it as a natural extension of \\"Moar Ghosts N Stuff\\"; that's how this album treats it, giving it the feel of a single track.<br /><br />The next piece, \\"Hi Friend!\\", is so much fun. After that the album mellows a bit, taking the listener into a place akin to trance and ambient. As a result, tracks 5-10 blend well, one into the next, and are relaxing, soothing.<br /><br />Track 11 is the encore song, an Amazon exclusive remix of \\"Ghosts N Stuff\\" that feels kind of tacked on because it is. But that's okay- it kind of peps you up after the deep soundscapes of \\"Soma\\" and \\"Strobe\\". I can listen to track 11 over and over all by itself.<br /><br />The final verdict: I would buy \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" again. It's the kind of album you just plain want to own. Joel Zimmerman works insanely hard at his job. I look forward to following his entire career.
B0000025KI|5.0|Maybe I'm all alone here, but the reason the River is such a good album is the way the vocal melodies seem to have REALLY improved for this one.  Bruce Springsteen was never one to write catchy vocal melodies because his attention mainly focused on lyric writing, his emotional voice, and the millions of fans who can relate to said lyrics.    On the River however, we're treated to all the things that made Bruce Springsteen great on albums such as The Wild, the Innocent and the E. Street Shuffle, PLUS the addition of immediately enjoyable vocal melodies.      Perhaps this was due to the fact that the rock scene in the early 80's changed for many musicians and forced them to write simpler and catchier vocal melodies in order to make it big and make a splash on the commercial radio scene, or perhaps Bruce just felt like changing his songwriting around a little bit to diversify his talents.  Who knows.      The River remains a classic album for those who appreciate great vocal melodies combined with the important lyrics of Bruce Springsteen from the past.  This is one album Springsteen fans MUST own.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I was even in the fourth or fifth row far to Steve Vai's left.  Although I can't point myself out in the crowd, even during those camera shots, I was there and I recognized one of the people in the audience.  This was a guy who I remember was in the front row, pretty close to the center, and he had an Yngwie Malmsteen shirt.<br /><br />Okay, about the DVD.  There were a few seconds of talking edited out here and there, and I was a bit disappointed about that, but it wasn't really that big a deal.  I remember him performing another song during the encore just before \\"Liberty,\\" but it's either missing from the DVD or I'm just remembering incorrectly.  I also assumed that they didn't film his front act's performance, but his front act came out during the show and played lap steel for a couple of tunes.  For the viewer watching the show on DVD, they see a special guest, for the people who were there, it felt kind of like a friend was coming onto the stage.<br /><br />This concert shows Steve Vai's talent as a guitar player, but I have to give just as much recognition to his amazing band.  Steve Vai has said that he can't spend more than a few years with one band at a time.  I was expecting to see Billy Sheehan on bass that night, but what I got was something very different.  Say goodbye to the quadruple guitar playing and hello to a mix of violin and guitar.  Alex DePue had an electric violin strapped around him, which was probably good for switching between keyboard and violin.  Ann Marie Calhoun was an amazing violinist, with a bit more of a traditional classical sort of style, and... I don't want to say anything about how she looked.  Bryan Beller was a great bass player, and was a much better choice for this band than Billy Sheehan.  Jeremy Colson had played drums for Steve Vai with the previous band, and of all of the drummers that Steve Vai had played with, Jeremy Colson probably has the most rock in his playing.<br /><br />Dave Weiner has returned, yet again, because he's such a help for Steve Vai.  When your first gig with Steve Vai is doing the tour where Alive in an Ultra World was recorded, you have a lot of weight on your shoulders.  When you're mentioned as more important to the recording than the artist who released it, by the artist himself, I'm not sure if the artist will want to get rid of you.<br /><br />Except for Bryan Beller, each artist gets their own moment in the spotlight with Steve Vai himself being off the stage.  Dave Weiner's tune was pretty good.  I can say watch out Steve.  Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun did a duet that included \\"Eugene's Trick Bag.\\"  And what's a concert without a drum solo?<br /><br />Steve Vai's moments were great.  His playing was amazing, he had great stage presence, and his singing for the songs with singing was also pretty good.  I will mention the acoustic set as a highlighting moment, but the rest of the show was also great.  There is a lot of great jamming to enjoy and cherish again and again with this DVD set.r Steve Vai.

B002MW50KO|5.0|Maybe that's why I like it. Actually, I have never heard of Bob Dylan until they mentioned him on NPR and that he was releasing a Christmas album. I heard a few clips and decided to try it out and it's quite different. I guess I'm a new fan now. I would recommend this album to everyone.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you don't understand much of audiophile nuances and just want to get inexpensive headphones without giving up on quality - get these. Headphones that give you a lot of sound for not so much money. Of course, there are better sounding, more comfortable, easy-to-use and durable headphones but you'll pay at least twice for them and still won't get everything in the package. Sony MDR-7506 gives you good external isolation (in and out), long flexible cord and most importantly - amazing sound that will make you to forget all these old cheap phones you own because \\"why spend another 20-50$ on headphones\\". THAT's why. If you still tight on money - simply go for similar MDR-V600 or MDR-V6 (tried them and loved as well).

B001DDBCUK|5.0|I have been very happy with the transaction to purchase the Sex and the city - The movie dvd.  The price was reasonable and also the postage.  I was happy with the time frame that it took to arrive to my address.  Overall I am very happy.  Thanks to the seller.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This movie surprised me. I was expecting B movie treatment of heretofore unknown superheroes. Far from it. This was one of the most stylish movies I've seen in a while. I cared and identified with the characters. I understand they came from a popular comic book but it was all new to me. And that made it all the more impressive that I was drawn into their world, a very serious world with a history that was different and compelling. I can't imagine a sequel. I hope one isn't made since it would surely diminish the accomplishment that was this movie.<br /><br />Michael J. Foy<br />Author of The Kennedy Effect
B000RJO578|5.0|The guys from Shaun of the Dead are at it again.  This is easily one of my favorite movies. It has the same type of humor as Shaun but this time instead of a zombie attack, they are cops in a small town.  Buy this and watch it.  You will laugh a ton without a doubt.
B00004RFFS|4.0|The DVD movie arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.  I have played it and it has no skips or scratches. I am pleased.   Thank you.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|For anyone that likes zombie-romance-comedy movies, this one is for you.  Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are two of the funniest actors ever in my opinion.  This is a classic.  It can get a little bit gory but barely.  It might make you jump once or twice too.  But what this movie is really about is comedy.  It is pretty much relentless laughs right from the beginning.  It's really intelligent humor too, not that slapstick stuff.  I recommend this to anyone because it's one of my favorite movies ever.
B002P7UCMC|4.0|I got it at Best Buy the day it came out but I wanted to really listen to it before pitching in my 2 cents...     While I do not think this album could surpass my favorites (Reise, Reise, Mutter, and Sehnsucht) I do not think it should be compared to them. LIFAD (like Rosenrot) is in a different class. There are subtle nods to previous works (especially Rosenrot and  Reise, Reise) but it stands on its own. It does so very well too. There is not one song on this album that I do not like. Only songs that grew on me or kicked me in the a**.     I am happy I bought this. If you get it, I suggest buying the deluxe version as well. You get some really amazing extra songs and a pretty, boxed, fancy, fold out digiack. Even if you don't like Rammstein, buy it just for the box. It's that cool o.o
B001UUY3A2|5.0|There are lots of great films in the martial art genre, but few which transcend the genre. This one does. It's a first rate movie which happens to be about a martial artist.  The acting is totally believable. The plot, based on a true story, conforms in many ways to the \\"hero\\" archetype discussed in Joseph Campbell's work. The direction and technical aspects are all \\"A\\" movie quality, and, IMHO, academy award material. The martial arts sequences are dramatically filmed, but not overdone, and Yen's ability to transmit the look of Wing Chun Gung Fu, a style which he studied just for the film, is impressive.  At this stage of my life, with 36 years of studying and teaching martial arts, I rarely feel the need to purchase a martial arts film. As soon as I watched this one, I knew I should own a copy.
0143116177|5.0|This is the kind of history I like -- history that tells a story. Niall Ferguson reveals the rise of paper money, fractional-reserve banking, the bond market, the invention of the joint-stock corporation, marine and life insurance, and the housing bubble. This is a great read. I loved his words on collateralized debt obligations: \\"At the time, the sellers of these `structured products' boasted that securitization was having the effect of allocating risk `to those most able to bear it'. Only later did it emerge that risk was being allocated to those least able to understand it.\\" Despite the crises, Ferguson asserts that developed financial systems are efficient and promote developed economies. Yet, he says, the human mind has an inherent capacity for fallacy. If you believe the tech bubble and the housing bubble are the last bubbles we'll ever see, then think again.
B0007939NO|5.0|Always a great choice if you love musicals, Brigadoon is even better on DVD. Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, and Van Johnson are outstanding, as is the score by Lerner & Lowe. A must-have for both musical fans and lovers of Scotland!
B002R0EIVI|5.0|I just got back from watching the advance showing of This Is It.  It was wonderful.  The movie is really well done and it shows a side of Michael that most of us have never seen.  I was very pleased at the amount of footage there was.  It showed Michael performing his classics and interacting with his cast and crew.  His sets were amazing and the things he was going to do were unbelievable.  I cannot wait until this comes out on DVD.

Most likely a disc dvd set with added rehearsals.  The film is 112 minutes long. The dvd will be out in time for Christmas, that's why its only running for 2 weeks.    R.I.P.

B0000046KX|5.0|I'm a musician as well as someone who adores great music, regardless of genre. I'm always on the lookout for new artists and new styles of music. But rarely am I surprised. This CD is one such time. From the very first note, I knew that I was in for a VERY rare treat! Kind of like when you stumble upon a bottle of red that renders you speechless with its complexity and sensuality. You just want to savor every last sip! What happens now is that I try to come up with words that are adequate to describe or praise Patricia Barber enough. And truthfully... there are none. Her music paints pictures you've never seen before. It tastes like the finest five-star cuisine you have ever experienced. And it caresses you like the most exquisite, passionate lover imaginable. On one hand, I want to keep Ms. Barber all to myself for fear that when everyone else finds her the inevitable will happen... fame and the big SELL-OUT. On the other hand, I want her to bathe in the praise that is most certainly, most deservedly, earned. I want her to know the success that belongs to others far less accomplished. But most of all I want to hear her grow and expand and keep making the music that only she can. So like a very fine bottle of red I will share Ms. Barber with everyone who will dare experience perfection. \\"A Distortion of Love\\" is a meritage, a blend of Patricia, Marc Johnson, Adam Nussbaum and Wolfgang Muthspiel. Producer Brian Bacchus squeezed out every succulent drop from these players, any of which stands on their own. So enough talking. Get this amazing CD. And when you do, put it on, open up that bottle of red you've been holding back, light a candle, and prepare to be moved as never before.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Canon products tend to be expensive and looking for \\"just as good\\" off brands is a sensible approach but IMO not when it comes to the battery. Why put an expensive camera at risk by inserting a battery made by ??? This battery works great. It holds a charge forever and more importantly was made subject to Canon quality control standards.
B000001ES9|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about this album! IT IS GREAT! A Great start for my favorite band. And look, we all know this isn't Peart on drums, but Rustey still opened the band in AN AWESOME WAY! RIP Rustey.  And some people criticize the album because it sounds too much like Led Zeppelin. Well you know what? WHO CARES! At least this band made their own lyrics! It would've been worse if they covered Zeppelin! Great start! Five stars! Enough SAID!
B0026RHR6K|3.0|The show, Battlestar Galactica, will go down in history as an incredible phenomenon that inspired a new generation to love science fiction and the word \\"frak\\". I can say nothing bad about the series, I LOVED Battlestar Galactica and I cannot wait to watch the episodes over and over.     ****Note: I purchased \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series\\" from FYE.com, but it is the same product. I did have one issue with my FYE order- the fourth season was missing one of the discs. I hope that was a one-time occurrence and would not be an issue to anyone who buys this. I returned the product and decided to purchase the seasons separately here on Amazon, instead.      My one issue resides with the packaging. It is poorly designed, so you will have problems finding proper placement in your media area for it. The package would appear to have a lid, but it is not really a lid. You cannot actually remove it; you can only slide it up, just enough to extract one of the season packages. The individual seasons are exactly that. The seasons are in poorly made cardboard cases, which house the dvds and nothing else. There are no episode guides (which was VERY FOOLISH, considering most people probably do not know which disk will have which of their favorite episodes, etc.), and like I've already said, the packaging is poorly designed. The Complete Series does come with one interesting item: the Centurion Cylon figurine (which, I must say, is difficult to remove from the plastic packaging on the top of the box) which didn't seem worth the purchase, but was interesting to look at.     I hope that those who love Battlestar Galactica or want to watch the show, having never seen it, will buy the dvds, but I would not recommend this product.    ***Note: Although the Complete Series is cheaper than buying each season individually, the end result is worth it! I want my Battlestar Galactica dvds to last a long time (and not fall apart after a short time)!
B0000714BP|5.0|I saw this on tv the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!
B000002JBG|5.0|I cannot really give a review on the whole entire cd as I did not listen to its entirety, but I mainly got this for basketball jam. I rented this movie recently for my son to watch with me, because I seen it on cable in the late 90s, but had no memory of it really. I developed a SEEEEEEERIOUS jones for Basketball Jones! I had to HAVE  this song! Be fair warned: You cannot get this version on MP3. I went to listen to this song on youtube, then it took me to my first exposure and discovery to the original, the original version being a year older than me. I do like the original, but love this better, especially the chorus part. I enjoy Fly Like An Eagle and I Believe I Can Fly. I Can Fly I heard over the radio back in its day. Basketball Jones makes me wanna get jiggy with it ( oh, right! That is Will Smith's department! LOL!) And hearing the brief few seconds in the movie, man, Barry White has a voice ON him!
B000ZELISO|4.0|I think this is one of the better Harry Potter movies. I liked the humor, especially from Ron (Rupert Grint), who has more to do in this movie and makes the most of his opportunities. The special effects are great and the sense of impending doom is well conveyed via a clever use of muted color- much of the movie is almost sepia. Jim Broadbent, as might be expected, makes Horace Slughorn an interesting addition to the cast. Michael Gambon has not always seemed to find the role of Dumbledore coming naturally to him, but this time round he is at his most convincing. Alan Rickman, as ever, is the creepiest and most mysterious figure in the story, Helena Bonham Carter is the epitome of uncontrolled evil and Daniel Radcliffe brings Harry to life in a way that must now be second nature to him. Emma Watson as Hermione is a little sidelined in this film, but Bonnie Wright as Ginny is now very much a young woman and it's easy to tell why Harry is finally seeing her as something other than Ron's little sister.     The main issue for many people seems to be lack of fidelity to the book. Like most lovers of the books, there are scenes I would have liked to have seen, notably Dumbledore's visit to Privet Drive at the start of the story, but the movie has to be considered on its own merits. The last 4 books are huge and contain far more material than could ever be included in a movie. The director and screenwriter have to consider how to move the story along in order to get to the conclusion; and they have to produce something that will work on the screen. A book can look into people's heads, but a movie needs something to happen to make it watchable. I think they did a good job in this respect and brought the film nicely to the point at which the final showdown can begin. Everything that was included made sense in the context of the story, even though in many respects it wasn't the way the book did it. As other reviewers have said, forget the book and you'll find the movie worksvery well.    Why only four stars? Simply because the movie is not a complete and self-contained entity. It assumes familiarity with the characters and it leaves the story to be continued. The full set, when it is released in two or three years, will be five stars. This is an instalment in a series- but a very good one.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I bought this latest Dan Brown book for my Kindle, planning on saving it to read on an upcoming trip.  Well I made it a whole two weeks before I brought down and started reading the book.  And once I started I couldn't put it down.  The detail and storyline sucked me right in.  I know that many of his books get plenty of attention and the entire plot and details are broken down and examined by professional to determine the \\"truth\\", and I have one thing to say about that.....it's FICTION, with enough truth thrown in to make it believable.  Why do you think he is such a popular author....it's because you want to believe the story he is telling.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  And what a ride this story was.  Buy it and share with your friends!
031606792X|5.0|I loved these books, the caracters as they develope and unfold, how they become a little part of you and how vividly real the author makes the story.    All those bashing \\"Breaking Dawn\\" I just cannot agree with you.  I laughed, I cried, I had a good time.      I am so bumbed \\"Midnight Sun\\" may never come into fruition (see her web site), what she provides there is as well another amazing story we may never get to read finished.  Very sad...(for all us Twighlight readers).
B002JTHFUS|5.0|The remastered CD sounds great, though a little bit of hiss from the original master tapes is apparent. The definition of the drums and bass especially is a vast improvement over the previous CD. My only gripe is with the DVD ... overall it's good, but why not include the entire Amnesty International Conspiracy Of Hope show? Their whole set was originally only about a half hour; why include just a half of that short set? Because the rest of the songs were covers? Come on. Also, why does Bad from Live Aid fade out after the whole long \\"Bono in the audience\\" bit? The performance joyfully went on forever and the band had about a minute to go before they finished; why fade out just as Bono walks off the stage? Minor gripes perhaps. I'm pleased with the box overall.
1563899426|5.0|Fables is a graphic novel bringing together a very wide variety of fairy tale characters in a common world, all interacting with each other in fascinating ways. The concept itself was definitely enough to hook me, as I'm a sucker for fractured fairy tales. Everything about it was amazing and for a person who typically has difficulty understanding graphic novels, everything was extremely clear and easy to understand. Parts are a little melodramatic, but it is still an enjoyable read all the same. The various fairy-tale cameos are such a blast to spot, adding another dimension to the story. While I found the ending to be extremely predictable, it was, again, a great read, and I can't wait to learn more about this universe!<br /><br />Rating: 5/5

0739328190|1.0|I read this and all recent books claimed to have been written by Obama. I also read that he had help from professional and ghost writers. Obama's books are more narcissism than evidence of a concern for social and economic justice under the US Constitution. Obama is just another great orator with less maturity, experience, and wisdom than most of our national and world thinkers. This book is just one more work of liberal Democrat propaganda. We all have dreams from our fathers...and mothers...but we choose to leave them out of print, so the book is just campaign and election fodder from a youthful and naive left-wing radical...and his even more left-wing and radical revolutionaries. At least Obama can truthfully claim to be African-American, an geographic-ethnic classification claimed in error by most other American blacks. After all, Obama may have been born in Africa and flown to Hawaii, or at least his father was a full African.
0312370849|3.0|I picked up this book at the library.  The cover just drew me in.  I had read \\"Suite Francaise\\" last summer and the description on the back of this book reminded me of it.  I enjoyed the story very much, but I didn't like the ending.  It seemed a little too perfect.  My favorite part of the book was the story from long ago.  It was heartbreaking.  I will look for other books by this author in the future.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I bought this GPS and compared it to the GPS that comes with Microsoft Streets and Trips program. I like this better especially that it has a longer cord of five feet and has magnet to use even on the outside of the vehicle if necessary. Its reception is excellent!

It has helped me make intelligent decisions of investments made and perhaps more importantly, potential investments NOT MADE.  Many of the errors I have committed have occurred when I have strayed from his ideas.    Graham was thoughtful, pragmatic, brilliant and ultimately very generous with his thinking.  In my humble opinion, he was/is without peer..    Read and digest this book and you will be well served..

Of course not all of Madge's fabulous videos are included like: This Used to be My Playground, Bad Girl, Nothing Really Matters, You Must Love Me, Oh Father, and Drowned World. Overall, I think this collection is great - I had no problem with the picture quality or audio. Frozen is my favorite Madonna video of all-time! She looked so gorgeous and tranquil in that video. I am glad to have Erotica and Justify My Love in this collection even though some parts are censored. No matter how terrible I am feeling, Madge can put a smile on my gloomy face. Long live the Queen!!!
B000002J03|5.0|I've always read and heard that Led Zeppelin was often undersold throughout their 10-11 year reign by music critics. If this is true, it leaves me dumbfounded. From the first riveting note to the last, this album / cd is still as jaw-dropping and ferociouly exquisite as the day it was released. Forget Guns 'n Roses and ANY other band that claims to have picked up where Led Zep left off. My friends, it all begins and ends right here.
B0015RB72W|4.0|Duffy's debut album, \\"Rockferry\\" was released shortly after Amy Winehouse's success in 2007. Since then, labels left and right have been trying to find the next Amy Winehouse. Enter Mercury Records and their signing of Duffy. While the Winehouse comparisons are inevitable, I will say that's not a fair comparison. She's more like a melanin deficient Deniece Williams. In fact, \\"Rockferry\\" sounds a lot like Deniece's 1981 album, \\"My Melody\\", the 60's inspired album that was produced by The Stylistics producer Thom Bell. Duffy's songs \\"Warwick Avenue\\", \\"Delayed Devotion\\", and \\"Hanging On Too Long\\" sound like they could have been outtakes from that album. As much as I wanted to give her five stars, I just couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.  Hopefully, on her next album, she can establish her own identity.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|...break out the ear plugs that is.  I get it Sting is facinated by over 5 centuries of music and has broken it out to torture our eardrums.  I can appreciate what he has done as an intellectual experience -- now that I've experienced it once I can put it away and try to forget about it.  I guess you figured out it's not my cup of tea and I like tea. Be warned listen to it before you buy.  Sample it -- I found the sound of his voice grating on the nerves -- most of the time distorted and unpleasant.  Liked the pictures and the liner notes explaining this but it still doesn't get my money back.
0385493622|4.0|I've dipped into a lot of books for \\"the general reader\\" about mathematics.  I've hardly finished any of them, not because I'm not interested in math, but because I would get bogged down in.. in what?  The mathematics, of course.  For those of you who are still haunted by Mr. Shepherd back in high school and still want to know why he spluttered and his eyes popped out when he was writing equations on the board, then this would be a great book for you.  There's the human interest story; Andrew Wiles sweating bullets for months because his solution, on which he had worked for seven years, to a 350 year old problem, was falling apart.  There's historical romance; eccentric mathematicians and their passions.  And by golly, there's mathematics, delivered so smoothly that I hardly broke a sweat over the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.  This is a beautifully put together book that is a pleasure to read.
0385504225|2.0|I am just starting chapter 32 (out of 133). So I'm about one quarter of the way through. Thus far  The Lost Symbol is a little difficult to swallow. All of Brown's books suffer from information dumps, but in this one he doesn't even try to disguise them.    Characters other than Langdon are literally just one dimensional things for him to talk at. Langdon will lecture for five paragraphs and then some other character will say \\"interesting, go on...\\" it makes me wonder if Brown has given up. For some reason in his other works I have been drawn in. The information dumps were tolerable, maybe necessary to get the reader up to speed in a timely manner so they can come along for the ride that is the rest of the novel.    Spoliers ahead.    Another issue are the so called cliffhanger chapter endings and view point shifts mid-thought. Katherine recounts her first time crossing the space between one door and another door in total darkness. She thinks about how simple their navigation system is. We have to wait several chapters to find out they put down a strip of carpet to guide you. So often Brown has the character think about something but refuses to tell us exactly what it is. If it's not going to spoil the plot just tell us! It is rather anticlimactic to wait five chapters to discover the ingenious navigation system is a strip of carpet!    Then there are the internal inconsistencies. Maybe someone who knows more about physics and science can answer this for me.    The entire purpose of having the lab in a dark enclosed area separate from the rest of the world is to prevent outside energy from throwing their measurements off. Okay, I can buy that. They can't have lights in the massive chamber surrounding the actual lab because the energy used to power the lights, or the photons emitted by the lights would muck up their readings. Fine. Then why can they have a hydrogen fuel cell, computers, and lights inside the lab? Is it because they know exactly what, and ho much is put off by the fuel cell and the electonics? If that is the case why they have a light outside the lab, determine what it emits, and calibrate for it?    It seems like brown just wanted an excuse to show the characters  struggling with a fear of the dark and to artificially create tnsion. And the tension is lame! Oh my God, it's dark, it's really creepy and suspensful. No it's not. Not in the least.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|\\"Sons Of Anarchy\\" is IMHO, one of the best shows on TV right now, if not THE best.  My wife & I are devoted fans of the show & never miss an episode; once you watch it, you're immediately hooked & will find yourself anticipating the next one.<br /><br />Boasting a first-rate cast, with \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" actor Ron Perlman as SOA leader Clay Morrow, British actor Charlie Hunnam as second-in-command Jax Teller, & \\"Married...With Children\\"'s Katey Sagal, who is superb in her role as Clay's no BS, hard-as-nails wife, Gemma Teller-Morrow, \\"Sons Of Anarchy\\" goes for the throat & never lets go.<br /><br />Every episode contains plenty of violence, colorful language & sex, but at times is hilariously funny; particularly with SOA member Bobby, who, when he's not running guns, beating the tar out of his enemies, & minding the club's money, \\"moonlights\\" as an Elvis impersonator in nightclubs as well as local parties & bar mitzvahs (Bobby is the only Jewish member of the club).<br /><br />I can't say any more here than what's already been said, except if you're a fan of shows like \\"The Shield\\", then you're gonna go nuts for this one!  If you haven't seen the show yet, start with this DVD first & then watch the new episodes on FX (which are even MORE intense than the first season's).  I'm sure you'll also get hooked on it!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|A rambling book of ridiculous scenarios, which is a terrible follow up to the Da Vinci Code.  It starts out bad and gets progressively worse where by the end it is a series of ever more preposterous settings.  It will take real work to get through the book.   It appears Dan Brown can, at this point sell anything he writes, but if he puts out many more like this one, his books will be a hard sell.
B000GIWRIY|4.0|Ian Anderson has always seemed older than his years, from the Man V God introspection of [[ASIN:B00000GAIW Aqualung]] to being one of the first major bands to embrace folkier elements (even during the rise of punk-rock) with [[ASIN:B00008G9JN Songs from the Wood]], so it is no surprise that their later music has aged as well as their earlier classics. \\"Roots To Branches,\\" Tull's final album in their multi-decade tenure on Chrysalis records, is one of the band's best 90's albums, in a league with [[ASIN:B000GIWRIE Catfish Rising]] and [[ASIN:B00070DK1E Crest of a Knave]].<br /><br />This was also an album where Jethro Tull stretched out musically. Anderson's new-found fascination with Middle Eastern music pushes some of these into sonically rich territory (\\"Rare and Precious Chain,\\" \\"Dangerous Veils\\"), while some of the extended arrangements sound alot like old fashioned fusion music, especially the title track and \\"Veils.\\" Martin Barre is still a guitar monster whose lead blasts show an artist that should get a lot more recognition that he does.<br /><br />Anderson's turf is as defined as it has always been. He remains lyrically obtuse as ever (\\"Beside Myself\\") and delightfully cantankerous. His smirking \\"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\\" could easily have been a part of [[ASIN:B00006JKOM Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die! II]] should such an album exist. And the thinly disguised parable of \\"Valley\\" (world conflict as a battle for water between mountain communities) is wonderful. The lost world of old haunts, \\"Another Harry's Bar,\\" is a quintessential old man's lament from a man who's penned his share (with echoes of classic [[ASIN:B00004Y6NW Dire Straits]]). Also, if you were wondering, Anderson's flute playing is a predominant as ever.
B000FC130E|4.0|A transplant to London like Richard, I was amazed to realize how little I'd questioned some of the odd names in town.  Gaiman's brilliant in the way he twists absolutely everything, his descriptions are -- well, I can't call them \\"lush\\" as they're frequently covered in some sort of viscous fluid, but they're incredibly vivid.  Messrs Croup and Vandemar are fantastic, Dickensian and horrible and truly chilling as they create the most lovely sentences.  They really stick with you.    I suspect that a familiarity with London is needed to take this book to the next level, though non-Londoners can read it as a fantasy novel just fine.  I only saw the UK series after reading the book, and the book's fine without it (and the book hasn't aged weirdly, like the series did).  But this shouldn't be dismissed as just a fantasy book.  There's a section of the book with the Black Friars that's very real and scary, and a description of madness that is about as frank as they come.      I really enjoyed \\"Neverwhere\\", and if you're a Londoner, bonus.

B002HWUU2C|4.0|The new album is great, but Amazon lists 20 songs for the second disc.  It only has 14 songs on there, and the songs that were left off are the reason I bought the 3 disc set instead of just the Strict Joy cd.
B002P6TA94|5.0|Like most people who loved Wolfmother's 1st album I was breathlessy awaiting their follow-up with the usual mixture of hope & dread. Then when the news came out that this band basically disintegrated hope & dread were replaced by curiousity & questions.   Could Andrew Stockdale soar with new mates?   COSMIC EGG is the 4th great album of the year. It builds upon their last album with shimmering sonic landscapes pulverized by jackhammer beats. These are retro rock's grandchildren taking their ancestors' lightning & using it to thunder across the sky with all of the energy of a volcanic eruption that you joyfully surrender to.   The classic sci-fi movie, ALIEN, teased us with the promise that \\"In Space No One Can You Scream\\". But Wolfmother counters this with \\"In Space Everyone Can Hear You Rock\\". (If you look at the cover work you know what brings this to mind.)   I tell people who have never heard Wolfmother to imagine some mad scientist --say Frank Zappastein-- throwing Led Zeppelin and Yes into 1 of Seth Brundle's phone booths together & see what comes out of the next one. I bet it would be Wolfmother.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|The Globalat BU-53 GPS receiver has increased the number of satelite I receive on my Street and Trips program from the orignal MicroSoft receiver.  The MicroSoft would pickup 3-4, the GloblSat picks up 7-11, it has reduced the loss of signal and the number of times the program drops.  The only problem i the connection wire is a little short, if it was a foot or so longer it would allow for a greater range of mounting locations.

1595141979|5.0|As I stated in the previous book reviews for the 1st & 2nd books in this series ... we got this on a recommendation of my then 13 year old daughter's BFF. We tore through the first book in a few days time (the both of us) & so it was off to the bookstore where we got this book (Book 2) & book 3. It took us about the same amount of time about 3 days total for both of us to read this book and the about 3 days for us to read the 3rd. The books catch your attention early & keep it with action & suspense. Good pick for you tween/teen & even yourself ... Give it a try!<br /><br />You really start to get into the Character's of Rose & Lissa ... there are other characters that are moving but these two are so dynamic that they get you and you start to wonder ... what will happen with these two? This book has some shockers ... the end especially so be ready to be rocked to the core!
B002UD56I6|5.0|My boyfriend and I saw this in IMAX at Midnight Oct 27th. Being a huge fan of Michael since 1983, made me so happy to experience this moment. My boyfriend didn't really like Michael til he saw the movie. And loved it too and thought it was one of the best movies he ever seen. He's now a fan too.    The crowd clapped and screamed Michael's name at the end of every performance. There was also some clapping and whistling during some performaces. Michael's performance was just as excellent as the 80's, maybe better at some times. It so was wonderful to watch this. Throughout the movie, he tells how to do stuff and the beats of the keyboards and sounds. He tells/shows how wants the special affects and more. Thriller is the best performance I ever seen him do for this song. The whole thing is awesome with creepy zombies special affects. Earth Song was also the best ever, but sad at points. The whole movie was just excellent from beginning to end. I felt like I watching a him perform onstage and not on the screen. It felt so real, like he was right there in front of us. This is an experience I will never forget and always remember. It's sad, that None of us will ever see him perform onstage again. But watching this movie, makes me feel like I just walked away from watching him perfoprm in concert. If I could rate this above a 10, I would rate it way, way up. It deserves more than a 10. I definately recommend watching *This Is It*    Sadly after seeing the *This Is It*. It makes me a little depressed and sad. Cause of watching him for many, many years. Sadly he's gone. Watching *This Is It* made me so happy, like he was really there. Like I said in another post. It felt so real. In reality, he's gone forever. But his legacy, memories and music will always live on forever in my heart.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson's This Is It(commonly known as This Is It) is a 2009 American documentary?concert film directed by Kenny Ortega that documents Michael Jackson's rehearsals and preparation for the concert series of the same name scheduled to start on July 13, 2009, but canceled due to his death eighteen days prior on June 25. The film is now the highest grossing concert movie and documentary in the history of cinema.[6]The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers and directing his team, and additional behind the scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. The film's director Kenny Ortega confirmed that none of this footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made for his fans. Ortega dedicated the film to Jackson's three children. The footage was filmed at both the Staples Center arena and The Forum in Los Angeles, California. Despite originally being set for October 30, the film's release date was rescheduled for October 28, 2009 due to a strong demand by Jackson's fans. The film was given a wide worldwide release and a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28, to November 12, 2009. Tickets went on sale a month early on September 27, 2009, to satisfy a high anticipated demand; to date, the film has broken numerous records via tickets both pre-sale and sales worldwide.Since the film's confirmation, AEG Live has faced criticism; mostly consisting of claims that they had only made the film to make a profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family had confirmed that they didn't support the film and some family members went as far as to try to stop the film agreement in August. The film has also been surrounded by multiple controversies, including allegations regarding the appearance of body doubles in place of Jackson; which Sony denied, and an outrage from Jackson fans; with some going as far as to start a protest against the film. On August 10, 2009, a judge approved a deal between Jackson's estate, concert promoter AEG Live concert promoter AEG Live, and Sony Pictures. The agreement allowed Sony to edit the hundreds of hours of rehearsal footage needed to create the film. Sony subsequently paid $60 million for the film rights.[7]The trailer premiered during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, along with the simultaneous launching of the film's official website.[8]The film was released to mainly positive reviews from both critics and Jackson fans; the film's portrayal of Jackson and his performances were generally praised, while criticism mainly consisted of both critics and fans having felt that the film was made just to profit off Jackson's death and that Jackson wouldn't have wanted the film released because he was a \\"perfectionist\\". In the film's opening weekend it grossed over $23 million - in the United States alone - making the film number one at the box office[5]and making it the fifth highest-grossing Halloween debut.[6]The film's worldwide revenue gross was in total $259.3 million during its theatrical run making it the highest grossing documentary or concert movie of all time. The film begins with a short text introduction stating the purpose of the footage and its intent \\"For the fans...\\". After short dialogues from various dancers, Kenny Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing his song \\"Speechless\\" acapella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the \\"toaster\\" mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of \\"Jam\\" is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaption of soldiers dancers for \\"Bad\\" which are also used for \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of \\"Human Nature\\" which he performs acapella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" come next (with scenes from the film Gildalike the one where Rita Hayworth sings \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\"), with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\" Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. A small animatic introducing the Jackson 5 is shown afterwards, and Michael then rehearses Jackson 5 songs: \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground).\\" Before he concludes \\"I'll Be There\\", Jackson tells his brothers and his parents that he loves them. Jackson stops only to report problems with his earpiece. After this, Jackson sings with Judith Hill, one of his back up singers, on his duet song \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the \\"Thriller\\" vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing \\"Thriller\\" with the vignette intertwined like that in \\"Smooth Criminal.\\" Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of \\"Who Is It\\" is shown next.During the dance sequence, puppets are suspended in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the cherry-picker is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing \\"Beat It.\\" Jackson creates the ending he wants for the song, a long drum build up in which he tears off his jacket and burns it. Footage of Jackson and the band rehearsing \\"Black Or White\\" is shown next, in which he instructs his band to skip the second verse and later allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar rift. The video-sequence for \\"Earth Song\\" is shown next, featuring a little girl who wanders through an abundant forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song both onstage and using the cherry-picker, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of Global Warming and the lack of reversible time left. Afterwards, Michael is seen conversing with Ortega, his dancers and band about the shows, trivial dance moves and his hopes for the concert series. He then performs a quick version of his song \\"Billie Jean\\" featuring an extra dance sequence. Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Jackson performs \\"Man In The Mirror\\" with strong backing vocals. The movie concludes with Jackson's arms extended on stage and the message: \\"Michael Jackson King of Pop, Love Lives Forever\\". The credits are shown next, with a montage of rehearsal clips and \\"This Is It\\" being played in the background. After the show, a live recording of \\"Heal The World\\" was played. Then, the audio of \\"Human Nature\\" was played, with an exclusive clip of Michael rehearsing it on his last day. Then, a clip of what could have been a Dome Project video of \\"Heal The World\\" was shown, in which the girl that appeared in the \\"Earth Song\\" video was shown holding the world and a signed message, by Michael, saying \\"I Love You\\" followed by his own signature.

160094048X|5.0|It was worth waiting for, you guys!  The authors of Veganomicon and Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World work their magic on cookies this time around.      First off: it's adorable.  The pictures, the colours, the font.  Yeah, I like the font!  It is such a charming cookbook, I really enjoy flipping through it.    Also, these seasoned pros give very handy tips for baking novices such as myself.  Equipment, ingredients, substitutions, troubleshooting, they've covered all the bases before laying out the recipes.    And the recipes themselves!  Wow.  I've made a few that were previewed this spring, the Magical Coconut Bars and Chocolate Peanut Butter Pillows, so I knew this was the real deal. But.....this just has it all.  All-time favorites, regional classics and innovative variations, everything you could possibly want in a cookie.  Snickerdoodles, Cheesecake Brownies, Sweet Potato Blondies, I mean really.  It's insane.      I picked up the book last night (my bookstore got it early!) and made two recipes from the \\"wholesome\\" section: Banana Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies and Applesauce Softies.  Utilizing natural sweeteners and whole wheat flour, they were hearty, earthy and healthy.  And delicious!      I leave you with this: Vegan Lemon Bars.  There, that's all you need to know.
0142000671|2.0|First and foremost, let me note that my review and negative rating has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed swearing in the book. The fact that people mention the word \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" with the ocassional insult don't and shouldn't constitute as heavy-duty swearing. It is in no way inappropriate for ninth graders - most ninth graders use far fouler language in everyday life than that mentioned in the book. The way that Crooks is referred to (some prefer to call in the \\"n\\" word) is not always an insult - it is simply how people called others of different coloring. I just felt that I had to explain my reasons, that's all. Moving on, the book isn't entirely bad. Steinbeck's ideas are convincing, and even though slightly depressing, I (as a reader), felt that they were not expressed entirely well. I found the repetition of certain words, purposeful or not, somewhat badly done. It just did not achieve what could supposedly be the intended effect.<br /><br />The characters could have been described in a much more detailed manner. Since this book was probably written with the goal of a novel easily adapted to theatre, the fact that description was toned down was understandable - but still, it felt very lacking. Though the description used for George and Lennie made it easy to picture the two main characters, again, the repetition of certain words really detracted from the passage as a whole. One thing that gave the novel the impression that it was rushed was the fact that some characters that were introduced in the beginning of the chapter two didn't really play a part later on. For instance, the Boss, Curley's father, seemed to have importance in chapter two, but he faded into obscurity after that. The dialogue, on the other hand, is quite fluid and natural.<br /><br />Even though the conflict in the book was very obvious, it could have been worked on and produced with much more profundity. The ending as it is is powerful on its own, but I can't help but feel that something is missing.<br /><br />All in all, that concludes my review. Please take into account that this is not meant to offend anyone: it is simply my opinion.issing.     All in all, that concludes my review. Please take into account that this is not meant to offend anyone: it is simply my opinion.
B002SJIO54|5.0|Very good movie, doesen't try to do to much in CGI,just enough.Leanes a bit about race,but thats life.I think people would treat AI this way if we could.But if AI made it this far they will be the boss.All in all one of the best new movies out there.I watched it and liked it,good acting and good plot.No stars,no over acting.Hits on a few topics.Greed is all around.Power is priceless.But Who has the power?
B0025KVLU6|3.0|This review is not about the White album. The remastering sounds great.    It's about Amazon's horrible shipping. When I received the album in a cardboard envelope, I took off the cellophane, and excitedly put the disks on the CD player.    While I was listening to the jet blasting through the speakers, I looked at the casing. It was crushed. The spine had been stomped on, squeezed or mashed in the shipping process so that it was crumpled. I looked at the cardboard sleeve, and it too had been creased from crushing.    I emailed Amazon, received a very quick apology and told they'd send me a new jewel case. I emailed back, and explained it was not in a jewel case, so they sent me a new copy.    Same packaging, same crumpled look.    Their solution? Here's what they say:    I'm sorry to hear the replacement Audio CD had the same problem as your first order. This usually doesn't happen. Since it's likely another replacement would arrive damaged, I won't trouble you with another order.    Please return the Audio CD for a full refund.    I responded as follows:    Really? That's your solution. Send it back, we'll refund you because we are incapable of sending the CD without it being damaged?     So every single person who orders the Beatles White Album from Amazon.com will receive damaged goods.    Really. Instead of changing your packaging of the product so that it arrives at customers' homes undamaged, you prefer simply to have those who complain receive a refund, and happily continue sending out products that are damaged every single time.    Hmmm. I own stock in this company. I've bought quite a few products through this company. But I'm beginning to see attitudes and behaviors that I saw at Montgomery Wards years before it went belly up.    Guess it's time to check out some other online retailers.    Beatles music lovers, check the case of your CD. Hopefully, it's not bent along its spine. But it sounds to me like, they have no intention of sending it in proper packaging.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I rented this DVD.  It looked quite interesting on the trailer so it was a, \\"Why not?\\" sort of a rent.  And I loved it.  I absolutely loved every aspect of this movie.  The script was so clever I was savoring every dialogue.  The casting was perfect down to the t.  Nobody could have played Emma Thompson's character like she did.  There's a scene where she talks about a fantastically depressing book that she'd read while researching death...haha~  who else could deliver such a line?  Nobody could have played Dustin Hoffman's character - a college professor and the only person who actually believes and tries to help out Will Farrell's character who claims he hears his life being narrated by a woman.  The process that he goes through to help out Will's character is ridiculous yet so logical.  Get this.  Since Will is in some sort of literature (or so he says) Dustin uses his literary expertise to help figure out the genre of the literature thus figuring out how his story/life will unfold.  That is ingenious writing at its best, wouldn't you say? I love that Will Farrell plays Harold, the main character, in this.  He's known more for his obnoxious comedy but I think this kind of role really suits him.  I think he possesses a unique vulnerability that makes him so likable and perfect for this particular role.  The comedic inserts throughout the film isn't the kind where you laugh out loud.  It's the subtle kind where you just smile and go 'dang, that was a clever line!'  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a good play with words.  Let me just say that I'm now the proud owner of this DVD.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|I can't believe this fool wrote such a horrible review of this wonderful and charming remake!  Sir Richard Attenborough was every bit as good as Edmund Gwenn and I think that it was one his most memorable roles.  As for Mara Wilson, she CAN act and played her part with great character and warmth.  She only made one other movie and then chose to persue her education rather than becoming another \\"has been\\" child star as the writer put it.  The rest of the cast was absolutely perfect from Dylan McDermott to Elisabeth Perkins, William Windom and all the others.  John Hughs made a new classic in \\"Miracle\\" and Bruce Broughton composed a memorable and magnificent score.  This film has and will take its rightful place in the annals of truly great Christmas movies.  Now, if they can just bring to DVD the Fred Astaire TV classic movie, \\"The Man in the Santa Claus Suit.!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Great film. Very insightful! Michael was very cute/funny and wanted to get everything just perfect. This concert would have been amazing! I esp. liked the \\"smooth criminal\\" part where he put himself in the black & white film. I don't know if non-MJ fans would like this, since it's just rehearsal footage. This film made me feel happy after seeing it, not sad or even bittersweet - just happy.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|We are enjoying the series.  Quirky but entertaining.  A must if you like vampire stories and very sexy too!
0375413405|4.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie. I was impressed with the delivery time that was so quick despite it came from america to UK. The content of the book is presented in original way, hand sketch diagrams and type writer fonts.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|omg, i love this cd! i couldn't wait to receive it. when i finally got it, it was well worth the wait. all of the songs on the cd sounds great. this is one of my favorite bands and will always be. i'd get it if i were you. :)
B002BJGYUS|4.0|As a fan from the very first show and suffering from withdrawals I was happy to have this on DVD. This is a replaement for me since my first set was damaged. I love the extras that they have been so kind to include especially the \\"GILMORE-ISMS\\"! If only MY brain could work that fast and witty. If you are a fan of the show this would be a required purchase because it does establish the characters and their relationships to each other; if you are a fanatic this set is great of the \\"Making of\\" the goodies and gossip the aforementioned Gilmore-isms and of course the ADDITIONAL scenes. I would say watch once for the entertainment and a second time with the \\"on-screen factiods\\" activated, such fun! Wish all TV Show sets were this much fun!
0307346617|5.0|One of, if not the best, horror novels I've ever read. The writing style is superb, the anecdotal stories of survivors guiding the reader through \\"World War Z\\", from its humble beginnings to the aftermath, in an incredibly well paced and readable fashion. Even if you've never read a zombie book before I would instantly suggest giving this a go.    Although not a novel as such, I would also heartily recommend the Zombie Survival guide by Brooks, and while I was a little disappointed his new book is a graphic novel, I'll certainly be buying it too, such was the impression World War Z made on me!
B0015AARJI|5.0|aprox. 15 dollars cheaper, free shipping (super saver) and a oem replacement. a great deal,
B002KSPKRS|5.0|this review wont be quite as long as the others here but i hope it helps.    I received these headphones as a gift, but if i knew how amazing these were i would have paid full retail for them. they are simply perfect.    Setup  the setup took me about 5 minutes to set up the transmitter, headphones, etc.     Look and Feel  first off, they straight up look sick. once you put them on (before you actually hear them) your jaw drops from the comfort and perfect fit. once you do get the sound going, these headphones are practically 100% noise canceling. not to mention, they are as light as a feather    Microphone  the microphone is coated in a flexible metal so it does not break (like the headsets you get with your xbox!!!!!). the sound quality is great and you get feedback (ie: when you speak, you hear yourself)    Sound Quality!  the reason you should buy these. its pure sex for your ears. but in all seriousness, you feel as if you are in a movie theater. the first game i tested out was halo3. i threw a frag grenade right next to me and the explosion was incredible. it made my heart start to race. purely amazing. i think you get the point, flawless sound.    i hope this review helps, thanks
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Her new songs are awesome!! In addition to her old songs, she adds 6 new songs to this CD and it is money well spent! Her voice is amazing; you won't be dissapointed! The bonus CD is fun to watch. It gives you an inside look of making the videos and how she relates to the people she works with. Her personality is so fun to watch and see how she interacts and plays around with her co-stars in her videos. I love everything about this disc!
B002T2IJX2|5.0|Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova return with The Swell Season 2.0 and there's no let down. At first listen, there's nothing as instantly catchy as the tunes from \\"Once\\" and their debut album. If you consider the fact that the tunes from those albums represent some of the finest highlights of Glen Hansard's career with The Frames, it's completely understandable. Even if their romantic relationship didn't survive staring at fame in the face, their creative muse did. They seem to have drawn on the end of their romance and the beginning of a different kind of friendship to craft the gentle sadness and cautious optimism that runs through this album. The lion's share of the credit still goes to Hansard but he makes good use of Irglova who's a stellar musician still developing her skills as a vocalist and songwriter. If you consider her age, she should be absolutely devastating as she gains experience. That doesn't even take into account that she was born to harmonize with Glen. Their voices were absolutely made for each other. Grab the deluxe edition and you've got a full length concert and dvd where Glen's skills as a front man are absolutely dazzling. I've heard some of the between song patter before and I'm not even tired of the storytelling yet.
1582701709|1.0|Books like the Bible, the Philokalia, the Republic, a commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, the Tao Te Ching, and the Analects are books that contain spiritual gems and reward spiritual work. Books like the Secret offer an immediate rush of exhilaration, but the exhiliration is like a street drug: down the road, the consequences aren't so pretty.<br /><br />A Hindu commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita offers a great deal of collected wisdom on what is most important in life and the spiritual struggles we all face. It may be exotic to Western readers, but this is really beside the point, and any real spiritual benefit working from such a commentary does not come until long after it is no longer exotic.<br /><br />I am an Orthodox Christian and I do not want to mix my faith with Hinduism, but I respect it. But the kind of respect I have for Hinduism is because there is a lot to it and there are many things people have benefitted from spiritually. The Secret, even if it tries to use the Hindu term 'avatar', is worlds away from Hinduism's strengths, and almost everything I have learned spiritually is that the exhilaration it offers is the bait to a spiritual trap.<br /><br />I tried to write about what exactly is the spiritually toxic surprise, in a piece on my site. The piece, actually a work of Socratic dialogue, is \\"The Law of Attraction: A Dialogue With an Eastern Orthodox Christian Mystic\\" at [...] - and if I wanted to communicate like The Secret, I would say that it is the dialogue that THEY don't want you to read.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I was a bit conflicted at first. I thought it was just a money making attempt. However, my mind was forever changed once I saw the hard work and dedication that went in to this show. The dancers...musicians...technicians...everyone! They all worked so hard for this once in a lifetime chance. It breaks my heart that the world never had the opportunity to see this magnificent show performed live.   What talent! What a loss.
B001R60ESE|5.0|My wife purchased this for me as a gift after reading rave reviews about the sound quality (96 kHz/24 bit) of this Blu-Ray on an audio forum we belong to. The moment she gave me the disc and I was very excited to tear into it! I honestly couldn't wait to see what it could do to rock my system (B&W speakers connected to McIntosh components) and it was playing within 2.5 minutes of being opened. I guess I'm still a kid at heart.<br />From the moment it started playing I was in awe. This is like listening to a high quality LP combined with superb HD video. Chris Botti has proven that he can easily stay away from the \\"smooth jazz\\" stereotype and on this recording he delivered something for everyone to enjoy from rock to Bach. To emphasize that point, my wife generally does not enjoy jazz and will usually leave the room when I am listening to that genre. In this case, she sat down with me and watched the entire video with me, commenting how great many of the performers were. She had favorites like Sting and Steven Tyler but she actually enjoyed other like Yo-Yo Ma and Lucia Micarelli. She got a few tears from Steven Tyler's dedication of Smile to his father and was very moved. My father who is now 90 years old and has a great love of music watched the disc on a recent visit to our home and said Ave Maria was one of the best renditions of that song he had heard. I would bet anyone among your family and friends that is between 16 and 100 years old will truly enjoy this recording.<br />In closing my review I would like to point out that our family  now usually rent instead of owning DVDs and Blu-Rays due to the uncertain future of where technology will take us and the fear of a load of obsolete media but this is one of those that you can play over and over. It is worth owning and worth every penny.  After the initial viewing it makes for great background music when working around the house and is nice to put on when guests are visiting.<br /><br />On a footnote I STRONGLY encourage you to watch some of the bonus material! There is a man who had a medical emergency in the audience during the performance and you will hear about it and how the Chris Botti and Sting got the audience back on track, it is delightful.watch some of the bonus material!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Watching is like having your own front row seat to MJJ's rehersals.  It's amazing what it took to put on one of his shows.  Saw it at the theatre on opening day, and will see it at least one more time...there is so much to take in...so much showmanship.  You won't be disappointed!
0307269981|5.0|This book was so much fun to read I was crushed when it ended! The first book \\" The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" was very good, but it took until the end of the book to really appreciate the whole story. This new book grabs you immediately - I can't wait for the final in this series and I'm very sad there will be no more.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|When Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009 it seems a part of the world died with him. It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias; journalists, interviewers and others. When I heard of the \\"This Is It\\" movie concert I didn't know what to think. I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I didn't know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it. When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that \\"This Is It\\" was going to be something special like I've never seen. And that's precisely what I got, I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it.<br /><br />It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great and fascinating to me. He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing. He gave precise instructions of what he wanted, made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done. The film shows just how much Michael was respected, there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something, it seems no one assumed anything at all. When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way, never to hurt anyone. There's not a part that doesn't make him look like the nice guy he always was. There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I don't know one could possibly believe them.<br /><br />To be honest I loved every minute of it, every song was special and was great to watch. Right from the beginning of \\"Wanna Be Startin'Somethin'\\" it was amazing. No matter how many people surround him he's always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you're watching. This Is It was really a unique experience, I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense. They could truly have messed things up but they didn't and came out with an amazing documentary, it's sort of a testament to his fans, it's just very special. I really liked the Thriller 3D part, it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider, the show would have looked awesome. They Don't Care About Us was amazing, The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting, so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest, waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed. I won't go further but every song had something about them.<br /><br />The stage show would have been grandiose, the fireworks, the \\"fireball\\" (quite impressive I won't spoil anything), pyrotechnics, the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive. This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them. In the end I was quite amazed by the 1: 48 minutes I watched, I can't wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring. From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the \\"This Is It\\" song I was captivated.<br /><br />The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael's history and his comeback along behind the scenes. I can't wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch.<br /><br />It's hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it. I know this is rehearsal footage but it's truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest. I don't have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself, This Is It is a must see. It doesn't matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released, this is amazing and his fans just have to see this. I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again. This man gave his life to music and his fans and I don't remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: \\"He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who's been mistreated by many opportunists, he's been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone\\" or sometime like that. These words are very truthful and really mean something to his fans.his fans and I don't remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: \\"He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who's been mistreated by many opportunists, he's been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone\\" or sometime like that.

1573300403|5.0|If you want to see an incredible musical genius then you should own this compilation. The Michael Jackson history on film volume II is amazing. But if you love Michael Jackson then you should already know that. The teaser is tremendous with Michael surrounded by military guards like the king that he truly is, it then goes into the motown 25 performance. This performace is the birth of an icon, many of Michael's signature moves are seen here for the first time including the moonwalk. The dvd includes some of his most famous short films: smooth criminal, thriller, and beat it; all ground breaking and all phenomemal. The dvd also includes the rarely seem videos liberian girl and a stranger in moscow. The dvd also includes one of Michael's greatest MTV performance which is a combination of some of his greatest hits and includes the guitarist Slash. The one downside to the dvd is that it is placed on two side instead of one. The second side includes his duet with sister Janet, and the song childhood which Michael has always recommended as a way for all to get to know who he truly is. Another video on the dvd is earth song, which highlightes one of Michael's greatest passions which is to heal the world by taking better care of the planet. The video happens to be one of the most requested short films of all time. The dvd also contains one of Michael's most controversial songs \\"they dont care about us\\" It is a good idea to get both volume one and two of the history collection, it makes for an almost complete collection of the superstar.
0312570740|5.0|Pretty accurate (\\"Not far from the truth\\" - as Mr Rich would put it), balanced, and a good read. Well done.
B002GY9F9K|1.0|Firstly, I loved Sam Raimi when he made Hercules and Xena. They were campy, and so fun to watch. The problem was, you never took them seriously. Now, imagine one of the best fantasy series every written, and then make it Hercules. It is painfully obvious that Sam Raimi never read more than perhaps the back cover of the book. It seems that they took his name from Spider-Man, and used that prestige and high budget to make the show.  The cast (aside from Zed) seems like they were picked from the phone book. Richard, rather than a tall, built D'Haran man, he is a small, skinny guy. Ever woman in the midlands has hair just as long as Kahlan's, and Darken Rahl isn't even blonde! While i'm positive that those who loved Hercules or Xena will enjoy this show, anyone who has ever read any of the books will want to sandpaper their eyes. I wish I could give this 0 stars.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Went to see this AMAZINGLY, MAGNIFICENT film 10/28/2009.  I have enjoyed every song video and interview of MJ throughout the years.  But nothing could have prepared me for this movie.  It was unbelievable to watch him in every aspect of the production of this stage show.  He was the GREATEST ENTERTAINER THAT HAD EVER LIVED !!!! I don't think we will ever see again anyone so amazingly talented.  I am pre-ordering my copy IMMEDIATELY !!!!
6305882592|5.0|The problem with Harry is he keeps trying to kill himself. Don't worry, he is not really bidding on the farm. He just wants a little motherly affection, which he doesn't get. Nowadays, the kid would be on about 70 types of medication. In 1971, mom just put you in analysis and  tried to get you married and out of the house.<br /><br />Harry really doesn't say much until he meets Maude. Maude is a lot like Harry--she lives in a train cabouse and likes to steel cars to express herself-only she is about six times Harry's age. The two strike up a friendship and eventually, make love. Only Maude actually is trying to kill herself, and dies on the night he preposes to her.<br /><br />This is another great movie by the great editor turned director Hal Ashby, shot in the bay area at the start of the 1970s. As in [[ASIN:B000022TS6 The Last Detail]], Harold and Maude has quick sequences that are immediate but have a lot of ressonence. Maude is friend, sister, mother and lover to the angry but ultimately kind Harry. None of this is said, but Ashby is able to make big statements with very small scenes. Ashbys' ecconomy was incredible<br /><br />At first I was a little disappointed because the movie shows little of San Fransisco proper, which is always good to see, but even better in 1971. Then I realized keeping Harold and Maude's sticking to the back roads and suburbs gives this the small, local feel that made Ashby's films so intimmate and immediate. Never doubt a master.<br /><br />Please, please please, do NOT try to remake this film
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Positively the best I've ever seen. LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!  I'M SEEING IT AGAIN NEXT WEEK! DON'T MISS OUT ON A POP GENRE PIECE OF HISTORY!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I love it when I watch these movies that I sort of want to see but I wouldn't pay to see them at the theater, and they blow me off my feet.  This movie was awesome!  I loved it!  Man, I highly reccommend this one!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to the advance midnight screening expecting something great because this was, after all, Michael Jackson. But I was totally blown away. Michaels live vocals are incredible. And watching him dance was like watching him 20 years ago, no kidding! It was a bit eerie. I kept wondering how could this man be 50 years old! He also surprised everyone with some mind boggling new moves. Obviously, this is just rehearsal footage. I can't imagine what a treat the live shows would have been. Unlike anything I have seen or even heard of on a music tour. With Michael Jackson, everything was big and This Is It would have been huge.     It was fascinating to see the  process of putting the show together and the tremendous amount of work that went into it. Michaels live shows are so well rehearsed that we don't get to see a whole lot of the real Michael. It was refreshing to see him singing with no extras, just him, the band, the back up singers, sometimes with a minimum of accompaniment. And for the skeptics; there was no doubt that Michael was running the show, as always. This is the best concert/music documentary that I have ever seen and was an incredible piece of film making. Kenny Ortega and crew deserve a lot of credit for making such a stunning movie from the available footage. There is something raw, real and touching about seeing Michael Jackson as a guy doing his job and doing it without a lot of fanfare and doing it incredibly well.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love the show, love the brothers, great season!  A must have for any \\"Supernatural\\" fan.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|A loving tribute befitting a true King.  Truly riveting, mouth dropping and Oscar worthy for sure.  I urge anyone who hasn't seen this in theaters, GO NOW while there is still time. If you are like me and never had the opportunity to see this incredible artist onstage, this is sadly the closest you will ever get.   Although not a finished product of his work, this film shows Michael Jackson working on what would have undoubtedly been the most triumphant return to the stage in history.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|The New Rammstein album. All the fans have been waiting for ages for the album to come out. But, finally: Here it is. Should we be happy; I would say: yes! Worth waiting for. Let's start off with the review of the tracks. At first I would like to say that I also would go into the lyrics(luckily I master German), which are great! Very solid album, worth 4.5 stars.    1. Rammlied  The improved version of \\"Rammstein\\"(the track of Herzeleid). More aggresive, faster, sounding better and it \\"works\\" better. The intro is great and the lyrics show you that your waiting was not for nothing. \\"Wer wartet mit Besonnenheit; der wird belohnt am rechten Zeit. Nun das warten hat ein ende\\"(Who waits with composure, will be rewarded. Well, the waiting has come to an end). YOU as listener are rewarded for your patience. In the track they also mention that they are BACK! At the Bridge Till Lindemann is shouting out his \\"EIN RICHTUNG!!!\\" etc. verse; it sounds a bit like Hitler's Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer, but I'm sure as heck that Rammstein did this intentionally: They WANT to be controversial, even though they are NOT nazis.    2. Ich Tu Dir Weh  I hurt you; I don't feel sorry, it feels good to me, when you're screaming! That's essentially what the chorus says. It's \\"funny\\"; so absurd; just great. The main riff is catchy as well as the whole song. One of my personal favorites of the album. It's about someone who loves him; but he doesn't love the other one. Actually the person Till sings about is being torture badly. \\"Bei dir hab ich die Wahl der Qual\\"; a nice word play. Usually in German it is \\"qual der wahl\\"(the problem of choice; which one to pick??), in this case it's the other way around: which way should he choose in order to hurt the person in question. Anyway, back to the song itself: the production of this song is very solid; one of the tracks you would listen over and over again!    3. Waidmann's Heil  A song about hunting in my opinion since \\"The Creature must die!\\". It sounds a bit heroic and the beginning, coming to the riff, which is so good compared to Rosenrot for instance. Just a quick moment of reflection; if you would place this album into a time period I would place in the gap between Sehnsucht and Mutter(according to the style of music etc.). The song is solid with some nice drum accents and Flake with his keyboard.    4. Haifisch  Not a bad song, nor the best. It's about sharks; crying into the sea. You can't see the tears since they are in the water and it is the reason why the sea is salt. It's quite an empty song, with a quite easy riff and some accents of Flake. The chorus is quite good with vocal back-up like we know from Rammstein(a bit like Morgenstern, but more on the background).    5. Bückstabü  The word is basically made-up and it stands for nothing; just like Till says: \\"Don't do it, Let it be, don't touch it, just say no\\", coming down to the same point. The song starts a bit \\"dark\\". The riff is great with a good bass guitar and same dark piano accents. The chorus is wild and raw: GREAT, Rammstein like we used to know them! The chorus is backed up with great guitar intervention at the end. The bridge is also vocally very strong. The solid production comes forward once more.    6. Frühling in Paris  At first I thought that Rammstein would nick the \\"Springtime in Paris\\" rhythm of the Jazz song, but no. An unplugged intro. The lyrics are in French and German. The main thing he(Till) says is that he doesn't feel sorry for anything. Personally I think this is the weakest track of the whole album. I don't want to spend much of my words to this song because I like to move on the good tracks!     7. Wiener Blut  Blood of Vienna basically. It's about the story of a young girl, trapped under the house of a certain Austrian guy(Jozef Fritzl). The lyrics are truly with a double bottom. It's sound all great(love nest beneath the house etc.), but the chorus reveals the true nature of the song: \\"Welcome to the darkness, the solitude and the sadness; for eternity. Welcome to reality!\\". The song is built up great. With an intro of: Come with me to my castle into my basement of love etc.. Then the song starts off properly, showing the reality of the story. Pure musical strength in my opinion; being able to mix everything together and expressing the correct feelings with the music, the way they intended it, and the way it should be.    8. P*ssy  It's not just a bad song, with a vulgar music video. It HAS a message. It's about people getting out of the country to have cheap sex in countries like Thailand etc. Mercedes Benz, the freeway. \\"Driving abroad on my own, travel travel, driving pleasure. I just want to have fun, I don't wanna fall in love. Just a little bit, be my little b*tch\\". The text is ironic as well; I can't get laid in Germany. Some double bottom lines like: lightning war with the flesh gun, stick my sausage in your sauerkraut and so on! You can see that this is the single. It's maybe the most accessible track of the album and the lyrical content is not that hard(a lot of chorus).    9. Liebe Ist Für Alle Da  Love is there for all. The album title track. Not the best track in my opinion. The chorus is good though. The lyrics are quite confusing. Love is there for all; not for me, but later on he says the opposite. It might be that he's telling stories from different perspectives. The music is less good than the rest of the album, the normal riff doesn't go like an oiled machine. The guitar solo is typical Rammstein.    10. Mehr  More! To me this sounds like the culture of grabbing everything there is to grab, even when it has no use. This song is inspired on the global economic crisis, so I think. The song is built up like it should be. Intro, drums and the \\"violence\\" rolls on! Quite a good song.    11. Roter Sand  Red Sand. It starts of with someone whistling. When you've heard it once, you'll whistle it yourself. Then some dark guitar tunes pop up. It's a love storywith a dramatic end. They both had guns(Two pistols, two rounds), but one pulled quicker, one died, the other one survived(It's deep in my chest). The song is great in his simplicity. The song just expresses the correct feelings once again. It just fits all together somehow. Just great!    And now... CD 1 has ended, but luckily you've bought the DLX version, so you will be rewarded even more. 5 More tracks await you. At first, a quick review of disc one. Solid, the old Rammstein seems to be back. Even Rammstein themselves call it a comeback. This album is the one that will make Rosenrot dissapear. With all due respect, the album Rosenrot was just made up from album take-outs of Reise Reise and some other recordings that didn't make it to an album. The normal version is worth buying but the 2 disc version(for just a couple of bucks more) is even worth more. With a nice booklet and deluxe cardboard package(which works quite complicated though; you have to practice how to fold it back).    Now disc two; five more tracks. Führe mich(Lead me) is first. It starts of mysteriously dark again. This really is a good track with some subtle details and a really (vocally) good chorus. Some \\"opera\\" features are in it as well. Donaukinder comes next(this track has some dark lyrics as well. Missing kids, a river, rats satisfied with food, poisoned water springs...this suggests that something happened to those kids(probably decomposing) at the Donau river; but like the chorus says: \\"where are they? Nobody knows what has happened here\\" ), also a good track which will give you the feeling you want more. This truly sounds like Rammstein from the days of wayback somehow. Halt is up next; sounds dark(again!), good track once again. Good chorus and again (sorry for mentioning this over and over again) sounds like the old Rammstein! The Roter Sand orchestra version is not very different from the normal version and could be more differing in order to make it better in my opinion. Still, itis a good track. Last one; Liese. Starts of with the whistling theme again. Has the same intro as Roter Sand(Orchestra) but with different lyrics. Also good, good vocal work!    Concluding to this; if you are only slightly interested or \\"made warm\\" for this album, do NOT hesitate to buy it; because it will be worth your money. This album can be played over and over again without getting boring. The only drawbacks are Frühling in Paris and the fact that the second disc only contains 5 tracks. For the rest of it: Great. Four and a half stars: ****+    RAMMSTEIN IST WIEDER ZURÜCK!    Regards,    Tom from the Netherlands
B002C6K7NU|4.0|I bought this as I'm going to see the band in concert this week and wanted to catch up with their latest stuff. I listened to the soundbites first and wasn't quite sure, however I went ahead with my purchase and it's won me over. I really think it's good enough to be a Skynyrd album, in fact I could see Ronnie and the boys recording something like this if they'd had the 30 years plus together they should have had, God bless 'em. This album has a little bit of everything, country, hard rock, southern rock, and although it does have a couple of pretty weak songs, (eg. Unwrite That Song), overall I think it's a really good effort with some standouts that I hope they play live, such as \\"God & Guns\\" and \\"Storm\\". You don't often say that about the \\"new\\" songs from a 30 year old band with such a tremendous back catalog of songs.    This doesn't have the sly storytelling humor of songs like \\"What's Your Name\\" or \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", and I'm not sure how they reconcile the old band's stance on songs like \\"Saturday Night Special\\" with the sentiment of \\"God & Guns\\", but that's maybe just a sign of the times, and the band are playing to their chosen demographic, the blue collar, right wing, country and southern rock crowd, and that's fine by me, they do it well and they do it honestly.    I'm very pleased with this album, and am enjoying it immensely. It rocks harder than I expected (Still Unbroken, Storm) and I think those are the strongest songs, however I think overall they've crafted a pretty good album here and it's really grown on me. The tribute to Billy Powell, \\"Gifted Hands\\" is a nice song too that'll get the lighters in the air and get a few tears flowing, probably me included.     The extra CD you get with the more expensive version is definitely worth the money too, I love \\"Hobo Kinda Man\\", sounds like something Ronnie would have written, and \\"Bang Bang\\" is good too and gets close to the storytelling songs of Skynyrd of old.     Lynyrd Skynyrd has meant a lot to mefor three decades so I don't praise this album without considering the history but I think Ronnie would be pretty proud of his little brother and the boys with this album, it's a good addition to the Skynyrd catalog in my humble opinion.
078693123X|5.0|Being an avid reader of all types of genres, very few novels, much less trilogies have ever inspired me to go back and re-read them just a few years after reading them for the first time.  This series is at the top of that exception list.  Despite a glorious list of twenty plus novels in the Drizz't series, \\"Homeland\\" still stands out as the best in the lot.    R.A. Salvatore first introduced the character of Drizz't Do'Urden in \\"The Icewind Dale\\" trilogy where initially, he and the publisher had intended Wulfgar to be the main character and focal point of his novels.  At R.A. Salvatore's own admission, two pages into writing \\"The Crystal Shard,\\" he knew that Drizz't would be the character to run with.  That being said, after the success of the \\"The Icewind Dale\\" trilogy, he knew he had to go back and give the back story for his most amazing character, Drizz't Do'Urden.    In giving us the back story for Drizz't, R.A. Salvatore guides us through Drizz't's birth and formative years in the Drow city of Menzoberranzan.  The author deftly spins a superior tale for Drizz't as he grows up a Drow with a conscience in a race dominated and predicated on cruel murder, political intrigue and betrayal at every turn in a matriarchal society where males, even in a \\"royal\\" house, are considered to be second class citizens.    In this novel, the author establishes many of the basic tenets of the Drizz't Do'Urden character, Drow society and the Underdark in the Forgotten Realms novels.  Many of Drizz't's associates are introduced here as well.  From his Astral companion Guenhwyvar to Jarlaxle to a few other characters that make appearances in later novels, the author launches what most readers will find to be one of the most entertaining and long lasting series of novels available in the genre.     High praise goes to the publisher for re-releasing this outstanding novel in hardback format.  Even more praise for this version goes to the Todd Lockwood cover which is far better than the cover on the original 1990 paperback release.  The first of thirteen of these wonderful Todd Lockwood covers in the Dark Elf Series.  Also of note are the Q&A interviews with R.A. Salvatore at the end of each hardback.    I highly recommend this novel and series if you're interested in some of the best fantasy fiction available.  I would even go so far as to say that R.A. Salvatore, with this series, has established himself as the JRR Tolkien of our time.  {ssintrepid}

B002MXA7TC|5.0|Conditions is something that the indie music lover dreams to discover- A creative record handmade by a humble band from Australia with incredibly talented members and unbelievable songwriting abilities. Great singles like \\"Sweet Disposition,\\" \\"Fader,\\" and \\"Love Lost\\" are obvious places to start; but even beyond these, The Temper Trap packs a punch. The haunting \\"Soldier On\\" could easily be one of the best alternative tracks this decade, and the energetic \\"Science of Fear\\" is an instantly catchy and contagiously original anthem for the ages.<br /><br />This fantastic band lives up to every expectation that can be drawn from \\"Sweet Disposition.\\" Don't even begin to hesitate purchasing this record- Your money will be unquestionably well-spent.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Speechless is how this movie left me feeling.  You will experience a gamot of emotions and mine were surprisingly upbeat.  It was like watching your child's recital. You enjoy it with all your heart but you also know it's a once in a lifetime event. You feel actually united with Michael like you are there with him. It's close-up and very personal and feels like you're watching outtakes of one of his concerts. Buy and enjoy!

0316154687|2.0|If you have never read any other Sedaris books, don't read this one. You may never discover why he is a popular as he is. By far the most disappointing book to date. Grab any other.

B001QXE0OC|5.0|I LOVE this CD, i think there is only one song that I don't like, and that is \\"As a Blonde\\". But I especially like \\"I won't apologize\\", \\"Naturally\\", and \\"Stop and Erase\\". But this is a great CD from a up and coming artist.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|\\"This Is It\\" is likely one of the best concert films ever produced, and that's saying something considering that the actual concerts never happened, and the limited time available to shape the ample rehearsal footage into a polished final product.<br /><br />While the film includes interviews with those associated with Michael Jackson's planned London concerts, many snippets of creative discussions, and other \\"behind the scenes\\" activities, director Kenny Ortega wisely focuses on performance in the film.  Serving that end, \\"This Is It\\" is chockful of energetic, heartfelt songs, meticulously-produced dance numbers, and other incredible elements that would have been included in the concerts, including some wonderful filmed sequences (one \\"co-starring\\" Humphrey Bogart and Rita Hayworth).<br /><br />And when Ortega chooses to include footage of performances that are interrupted (usually by perfectionist Jackson) with creative banter on how this or that song should be tweaked, or how a musician should lengthen or highlight a chord or bar of music, it's all extremely fascinating.  We see from Michael Jackson's interaction with his musicians and producers that, despite his time away from the limelight, he was still sharp, engaged, and still very much touched by genius in the area of music and performance.  Oh, and he also repeatedly came off as a gentle, nice person.  And a generous one: a particularly touching scene shows Jackson urging his female back-up guitarist to step up and not be afraid to make the most of a solo moment (\\"this is your moment to shine!\\").<br /><br />It's also uplifting (and even a little funny) to see Jackson not being able to resist giving full-fledged, amazing rehearsal performances despite the many times he says, \\"Now I'm going to hold back a little and save my voice for the shows\\".  After one such performance (Jackson singing a wonderfully re-imagined \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" with an enthusiastic but pretty outclassed duet partner), Jackson apologizes to the crew for again getting lost in the moment and not holding back. To which Ortega essentially tells him to not worry about it because, after all, how can Michael Jackson not help but be Michael Jackson?<br /><br />\\"This Is It\\" will be a wonderful DVD to own (I'm sure the extra features will be amazing), but I'm glad that I made the trip to see the movie on the big screen.  If you can, see it that way first to get all the more impact from this entertaining, illuminating, and bittersweet farewell to Michael Jackson, both the musical icon and, more importantly, the man.crew for again getting lost in the moment and not holding back.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|I have both of here CD's and this is even better than the first which i loved. This is just a great CD by a Great singer.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Like the first, the sequel suffers from being too long and literally trying to adapt the book. It worked for Lord of the Rings and they STILL cut out a lot from the books (though they did embelish a little in Two Towers by bringing in the Elves at Helm's Deep but I digress). The young cast has aged a little, clearly for the young men (they're voices are starting to get deeper). Though, to me anyways as I haven't read the books in a while, it gets a little tiring of Ron Weasley being reduced to the comedic sidekick. I know he is one, but not all need to be used for comedic relief. The elder cast is still perfect for their respective roles and Kenneth Branagh is excellent as the ego-centric Lockhart. Again, they could've trimmed up a few things; Harry didn't need to look at every little thing in the Weasley's home (despite the fact that he's not used to magic homes), Ron's slug scene could've been eliminated, some characters that're important in the novel (like Justin and Colin [who at least is important in later books]) are glanced over and are only petrified as that's what happens to them in the book. Still no Peeves (the one character I'm glad they decide to cut out as he adds nothing to the story) and instead of they're ghostly Magical History teacher giving the speech on the Chamber, its McGonagall, which I think is a better switch as they're history teacher is hardly ever mentioned once or twice in the books anyway. Action scenes and CGI are better in this than the last, Dobby and the Basilisk being the highlights of the computer charcters. And hardly any new music from John Williams, who's music from the first film is pretty much tracked to this.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I went to see this show today and all I can say is that Michael was in AWESOME FORM...point blank! As for the reviewer who stated that at times he looked drugged etc. etc. Do Not Believe That! First of all what you see on screen is a man whose been on earth for FIFTY YEARS that danced better than every twenty something year old on stage! He was just AWESOME and this was only rehearsal so one can only imagine how great the concerts would of been! I adore MJ!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Like 1983 being the year for movies that have 3 in common, 2002 was the year for part 2's (Star Wars, Harry Potter and this). Again, can't really remember what wasn't in the original release so I'm reviewing the extended one. The cast continues to capture the essence of their characters and adding new dimensions (like the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is hardly touched upon in the books). The new cast members (Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, etc.), like the original cast, capture the characters perfectly. Gollum is finally featured (having brief cameo spots in the first) and is the scene stealer of the film (another common occurance of 2002 was the advent of realistic looking CG characters; Yoda, Dobby and Gollum). The dual nature of the character is intriguing and you really feel sympathy towards him as he's completely bound to the Ring. And Andy Serkis really does an excellent job of switching between the softer voice of Smeagol and the harsher tone of Gollum. The action sequences build upon what the first film has done; the Warg battle and the Battle of Helm's Deep, along with the attack on Isengard are noteworth. Again, from what I can recall of the theatrical version, this is the superior version. For thanks to a new scene, we see the brotherly relationship between Boromir and Faramir and how Denethor (who originally was first shown in Return of the King) favors Boromir.
0307408833|3.0|The best gluten-free baking books will require the cook to use Authentic Foods superfine rice flours. They are hands down best for baked goods. I have adapted many recipes in the wonderful Gluten-Free Baking Classics by Annalise G. Roberts to agave instead of sugar. It's pretty easy. What can't be adapted I make less often and use organic, fair-trade cane sugar.     It's great to have a large offering of gluten-free baking options but I find that all I need are excellent ingredients, the correct flour (Authentic Foods works so well because it is truly powdered, just like wheat flour, most rice flours are grainy), and one comprehensive cookbook to base recipes on.     I recommend Gluten-Free Baking Classics as that book, it's a better investment.
1594488878|3.0|\\"Juliet Naked,\\" Nick Hornby's new novel revolves around two principal male characters and the emotional havoc they wreak because of their social and emotional disabilities. All those who have the misfortune of becoming intertwined with them suffer as a consequence.  Hornby has become the modern day Chaucer of sorts: a chronicler who follows around emotionally caveman-like males in the world and then relates them for the reader. He simply creates the characters and chronicles the damage that their existence causes.  This journey is usually achieved with darkly sarcastic humor, extraordinary wit and a faint sense of dark optimism that incremental positive changes may surface from these stunted beings.    This is not to say that Hornby's characters are stunted Neanderthals dragging their knuckles on the ground and grunting monosyllabically. They are the kind of men you would find at your local coffee shops or independent record stores. They are men of intelligence, worldliness and curiosity. Their downfall is an inability to sustain emotional attachments to human beings that match pace with their single minded intellectual obsessions stemming from their youthful pursuits and fascinations. They are emotionally stagnant, and in some cases, backsliding towards boyhood. They have been doing so since they peaked around the age of twenty. These men leave the emotional carnage all around them, both slight and sizeable. This is the sad fact for those who either choose or are obligated by the forces of life to embrace them. This has Hornby's primary recurring theme in his works over the last twenty years.     .   One such character is Tucker Crowe. Crowe was a musical auteur in a Dylanesque like vein in the early nineteen eighties. However, his inability to deal with his love life, booze, and the pressures of producing art that measure up to his lofty expectations leads him to walk off stage in middle of a show in Minnesota, never return to the public eye again.  Crowe fiercelyguards his chosen obscurity as he disappears into a life of booze and women who nurture his childlike needs. Like some sort of musical Salinger only with much less talent and impact, he has turned his life into figurative medieval castle where he does everything to shut out the world of fame.  Whether it is his children or their mothers he manages to alienate them with his ever present emotional distance.   The second character that the novel revolves around is Duncan, a socially and emotionally inept lecturer at a small English college. Duncan's sole obsession is his perceived brilliance of all things connected to Crowe fleeting career. This obsession becomes his life's solitary fixation and emotional outlet. Duncan is the pied piper of a website that chronicles every Crowe real or imagined sighting, unearthed bootleg recording etc. Duncan is the perfect parody by Hornby of the levels of obsessive fandom that can be pursued today through the internet.    What ensues is the litany of emotional damage these two central characters inflict upon those who come into contact with. Whether it is the various children and damaged women that Crowe has left around the United States and England from his performing days or his booze fuelled journey into obscurity afterwards, it is undeniable that Crowe has caused a tremendous amount of human wreckage along the way. In Duncan's case it's a fifteenth year of emotionally vacant relationship he has engaged in with a woman named Annie that is where he has done damage. This relationship coincides, as a distant 2nd in a two horse race, with Duncan's quest for all things concerning Crowe with his cadre of internet groupies around the world. In Annie he has a smart, loving partner who transforms into an unwitting enabler over time. Not because she is fool, however. She just comes to believe that this is best way to try to reach the parts of Duncan that hide behind his Crowe obsession.   As in most of Hornby's novels, the women in the stories come off being much more developed and emotionally engaged than the principal male characters. Not that they are all faultless matrons; if they were how could have they gotten themselves involved, and stayed with, such emotionally regressed men in the first place?   The theme of women as being more emotionally mature and responsible beings, is no different in `Juliet Naked' than in Hornby's other novels. The fact is that his female characters are always a bit more to the point and emotionally honest.  Hornby seems to see the world in this light and as with his other novels. Hornby's stories never wrap themselves up in neat bows where all faults are exorcised and everyone is redeemed. The true pleasure of this novel and all his novels in general, is to be taken from the humor and wit that passes for ordinary banter and the odd moments of special brilliance that pass among common people that get lost in the larger narrative of life. In this novel Hornby uses a broader canvas than he has attempted before and therefore is missing some of the tightness and focus of \\"About a Boy\\" or High Fidelity\\", two previous works I believe to be superior to this one. Hornby's new work could benefit from some of that focus. At times, it seems he was writing without a plot in mind, which isn't necessarily, a bad thing. However, when it becomes obvious that you are using grammar, pointless small talk, and the ensuing syntax debates that emanate between characters while attempting to discern what your next plot turn will be, it tends to become a distraction for the reader. Especially for those who are not initiated and avowed fans of Hornby's work.  There are no epiphanies in this novel or any Hornby novels for that matter. What we have to settle for is small gestures marking progress towards emotional growth. Whether it is Crowe's attempt to reconnect with all those woman and children he has left or Duncan's small overtures to Annie to say sorry for 15 years of neglect, this is allyou are going to get. They want to make amends for what they have done but they may lack the emotional tools to do so. With Hornby's novels you have to settle for minute, incremental gestures of good faith. If you are a fan of all-encompassing character transformations you are advised to seek other authors.   Where Hornby succeeds on equal or greater footing with his other works  in `Juliet Naked' is in demonstrating no matter how lightly (or not) we tread we leave our footprints where we go. This is even true in cases like Duncan's, where the character does not go very far at all. It is the accumulation of these footprints that eventually lead to a confluence of circumstances. We cannot avoid these because they are the concrete evidence of our existence. So, tread as carefully as you please, the novel warns us, but those footprints are amassing.  At some point we will have to deal with them. Like most things avoided the damage done is far more extensive when dealt with later then sooner.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this movie Tuesday evening (big city livin') and it was absolutley AWESOME!! I felt like I was invited to the rehearsals and was there watching it with the tech guys and the dancers.  Michael is an amazing musician and dancer.  More than that, this shows what a caring, loving, man he was, he loved all of humanity and the world.  I've always had respect for Michael, but that level shot through the roof last night.  I would highly reccomend you see this movie in IMAX, the sound and picture couldn't be clearer.  I may just see it again while it's in the theater, just for the experience.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Was awesome to watch...a must see for fans!  Not one person got up to leave the theatre after this was over!  We all wanted more!  Love it!
1594132666|1.0|Elizabeth Gilbert was a self-absorbed, married, thirty-something living the privileged existence of an affluent writer in the most powerful nation on Earth, when, suddenly - shock-horror - she realized that she wasn't happy. As a consequence, she cast aside her husband, took up with another man - with whom she still wasn't happy - and, after this relationship fell into inevitable dissolution, decided to run off around the world in order to \\"find herself\\" (one must assume that she'd already looked down the back of the sofa) after receiving a handsome advance from a publishing company to chronicle her subsequent exploits.    \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is pseudo-intellectual, altruistic, mother-my-dog pap of the worst kind masquerading as spiritual insight. Read between the lines and it expounds selfishness as a virtue and mindless hedonism as both philosophy and legitimate path to spiritual insight. Unsurprisingly, that great doyen of the gullible, Oprah Winfrey, loved it and made it one of her book club choices, thus unleashing it to a wider audience than Gilbert's talents as a writer would normally have ever allowed. Apparently, God help us, a big-screen version with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is currently in the offing.    As a literary construct, Gilbert herself seems to be the contemporary living embodiment of Tom and Daisy Buchanan from \\"The Great Gatsby\\", of whom F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, \\"They were careless people...they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness...and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\\"     \\"Self-absorbed\\" does not begin to cover it; \\"self-centred\\" is not nearly an adequate description. One hopes that she can't really have been so completely inured to the poverty of India and Indonesia by her solipsism. If so, then she seems to be genuinely emblematic of a subset of the \\"sex and the city\\" generation of women who put their own self-gratification above all other things. Worryingly, this attitude seems to be becoming increasingly more prevalent in western society.     I will be honest, I first happened upon this book after briefly seeing some of Winfrey's interview with Gilbert on television and consequently read three quarters of the book in my local library - and was so completely incensed that I felt it my civic duty to warn you off of this book.     If you want a genuinely enjoyable book to provoke introspection, this isn't it, but may I politely suggest Tom Hodgkinson's [[ASIN:0060779691 How to Be Idle: A Loafer's Manifesto]] and [[ASIN:B002FL5ENU The Freedom Manifesto: How to Free Yourself from Anxiety, Fear, Mortgages, Money, Guilt, Debt, Government, Boredom, Supermarkets, Bills, Melancholy, Pain, Depression, Work, and Waste]] or Lin Yutang's [[ASIN:0688163521 The Importance Of Living]] in it's stead; If you want a decent travelogue, may I politely suggest any Bruce Chatwin's books, and if you really want to read a writer with talent give the exponents of the Gilbertian philosophy of self-aggrandisement both barrels, then I strongly recommend Michael Bywater's [[ASIN:1862079528 Big Babies: or: Why Can't We Just Grow Up?]]
B002OB9KPE|3.0|Well, here it is.  The long awaited, highly anticipated third release from Transatlantic.  Yeah, I'm gonna kill it here, sorry everyone.  While I waited for this as much as anyone and I guess expectations run high, especially after the previous two releases, I couldn't wait for the first listen.  Is the third the charm here.  I would have to say no.  By no means is it not a worth while effort.  My expectations were somewhat different than their finished product.  With that said, and it is only my opinion, I almost agree with the other 3 star reviewer here.  I'll call this album Lifeline Part II by Neal Morse and company.  It's an okay album, but just doesn't measure up to 'SMPT:e' and 'Bridge Across Forever'.  Maybe they should have left it at two.  While I've already listened to it a couple of times, this album just doesn't blow me away.  Yes, their musicianship is superb.  It's just that this album doesn't grab me and I find it rather boring which I didn't want to because I love their other two albums.  This album doesn't have the feel of the other two and it just comes across as Neal doing his thing and he asked the other three to join him for the ride.  Face it, this is a secular band doing Neal's Christian duty here.  I loved the veiled references to Neal's Christian walk in the first two albums and thought they just delivered and were thought provoking.  And I thought they blew away anything out there in today's Christian market which they did.  This album is more in your face as far as the Christianity aspect (maybe it's subtle, but Neal is more direct this time around).  Not to say, there's anything wrong with that, but I thought Neal would have kept that separate with this release and kept to the veiled references instead if he was going to pursue his faith within his lyrics.  He hasn't and, for me, just continued his solo career as a Christian adding his former band mates.  I'm just not sure that I will be playing this over and over anytime soon while the first two do get played again and again.  I'm trying not to compare this to the first two, but it's pretty hard not to and I'm trying to rate this on its own.  I think you need to listen to this as a whole and not as separate pieces as one reviewer stated that each song can stand by itself.  I don't agree because then the songs listened to separately are taken out of context of the entire story.  I wish I could have given this five stars, but just can't here.  The bonus disk is nice, but nothing there either worth noting for this outing of four original tunes and four covers.  It almost came across as filler to include with the purchase.  Sorry for being so hard here, but my expectations were high and I just didn't want another Neal solo epic album.first two do get played again and again.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|My pal Jimmy Z turned me on to these guys. He saw them live and raved about them so I got the CD. Very very good from beginning to end. In an age where listening to entire albums has lost some appeal, the 59 sound doesn't have a bad track. Well done Gaslight!!!!  Glovetron
B000ICL3CO|5.0|If you dont like the Cure then why even read this post? Anyone that knows The Cure will have to realize the KISS ME TOUR was the best Concert ever made. Ok.. one of the best! This album has such depth and varied instrumentation that it will calm you, excite you and even get you up off the chair and moving.. Need any more be said? buy it ! unless your broke.. then start saving and buy later.
B0009F2EPU|3.0|The rot set in when opera house managers realized that there was a profitable link between embracing \\"new\\" artistic concepts of staging and saving money.  In the 70s, Chereau's production was widely seen as a new low - we were not supposed to see through the crass \\"updating\\" of Wagner's stunning adventure into the cost-cutting exercise which it really was. We were supposed to admire Chereau's bold vision and then shut our eyes to the reality.  But the worst of it is that the next generation, the disciples of such worldly gurus, use their \\"revolutionary\\" teachers as role models in order to misunderstand Wagner's basic premises even further, building careers solely upon the basis of saving money. Opera house managers just love them, of course, quite unaware of what they have lost.  I repeat: Wagner's work is an ADVENTURE into the depths of nature and of humanity, to be experienced on its author's terms.  When he said to his offspring: \\"Kinder, schafft Neues!\\" (\\"Children, create anew!\\") he was expressing the hope that his work would not become fossilized to the point where it would only exist as a museum piece.  He was NOT trying to encourage them to pluck a fish out of water and watch to see how long it would take to die.  Others before Chereau began the process of plucking Wagner's adventure out of its natural environment, but this year's Bayreuth Festival must represent some sort of consummation of this process. There is no adventure, nature or humanity left - only a cynical addiction to the idea of \\"updating\\", so that everything great, everything beautiful and everything honest about Wagner's endeavours in the face of ceaseless opposition and financial difficulty has been removed - along with everything expensive, of course.  We are now left with an up-to-date corpse. The very last thing the poor composer would have wanted.  Thank Heaven for audio CDs which still allow those of us with imagination to see into his world!  That said, I love listening to the Chereau DVD discs - the sound is lovely, if too obviously compressed at times, and Boulez is transparent and perceptive, however slick he may seem to some ears.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw This is it last night and I am simply speechless!  The music was awesome, the dancers INCREDIBLE, the female guitarist ROCKED!  It is bittersweet, because it left me wanting more and wanting to see the actual concert and we never will.  However, I did get to see Michael as a person - his sense of humor, his creativity, his KINDNESS! - it's all love!  I was moved to tears watching his dancers mesmerized as they watched him perform solo on stage - their applause and excitement was NOT gratuidous (sp?) I am just so moved, that I cannot even think of all the things to say in this review.  One thing I would like to say to others who have seen it and were disappointed and to people who have not seen it yet - this is NOT a concert film, it is a documentary pieced together from photographers filming his rehearsals and at time it is gritty, but I found it only added to the feeling of the film - it was like BEING there.  Try to keep that in mind and you will enjoy it.  I LOVE and MISS you Michael - wherever you are - Thank you for this is it - I will NEVER forget you.
0545123267|4.0|This is an unusual take on the werewolf mythology, and one that makes the story exceedingly interesting. Stiefvater does a wonderful job of describing the overwhelming emotions of the two main characters, and makes their attraction to each other realistic and endearing. My only complaint is that the novel slows down in the middle, and drags on too long until the climax actually occurs.
B002R4K6AG|4.0|Bob does a good a job as he can with his voice and age to produce a heartfelt Christmas album.
0316518565|4.0|Very interesting, especially his attempts to right the wrongs, however he does a lot of justifying because superiors were not paying attention. . . you may also enjoy 'The Ugly Americans' by Ben Mezrich
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Fun, fresh every time, entertaining, fascinatingly odd, startling, amazing. This was a classic the first day it ran - and it ran with bizare eloquence. It will make you think as it beckons you to attempt to proceed without being underdetermined.<br />Logic V. Passivability. Life V. Illusion. Buy this to own it for you will watch it 2-3 times every year, or more!
B00004HYLF|5.0|Bought this album when it was released in '76 and it still sounds awesome after hundreds of listens.  Never get tired of it. Like a great movie, kind of never want it to end. There is just so much here to digest.
B00005QGAX|5.0|If anyone ever wanted to hear what it took to make this album then they should buy this to hear Quincy Jones give his own interpretation of how the 33 songs Michael Jackson wrote either made it to the album or not.  Very entertaining as well as interesting and comical in parts.  Just buy it and you will see!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|It was a good movie...  It was different than your typical film because you the viewer watch everything through the view of a camcorder as if what you were seeing really happened.  You experience everything with the guy holding the camera from his moronic interactions with those around him from the fear of running from the chaos created by the monster.    Beyond that the special effects were great from the decapitated Lady of Liberty to the monster(s).      I would have probably given this movie 4 stars had their been more screen time of the monster.   While watching the film I was a bit frustrated because I wanted to see more of the monster as opposed to people running away from it.       So....
B00005QGAV|5.0|A must have for any music enthusiast.  Michael Jackson makes a person wonder how did one person write so many great songs?  A must have for anyone young or old.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I love this show. No i don't have the dvd. I don't believe in buying tv shows that i can easily watch on HBO on Demand but this show is incredible. Everyone wants to make money off the success of vampire movies like Twilight. This show does it the right way. Yes, It has vampires but it's alot more than that. This show creates an entire new world. A world in which Vampires are no longer in hiding. A world that also includes many other mystical creatures. This show has it all and will hopefully be around for a very long time.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Entertainment at it's finest.  Buy  this for yourself and for your friends and you will always be glad you made the move.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|I don't understand why this has so many positive reviews. This movie is so bad i could not finish it. Thats saying alot because i sat all the way threw Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. There are no big name actors in this movie. I'm not saying you need a Will Smith or Tom Cruise but maybe it would have helped. These actors seem like complete amateurs. The main character is this realy boring little man. I read a 5 star review that admitted that the main  character was very hard to like. If you believe that then why would you give it 5 stars?  Even the aliens don't seem very intriguing. I gave it 2 stars because it does try to tell a decent story. It just fails everytime that it tries. Watch this at the risk of being bored out of your mind!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this for my Quinny Zappy stroller because it doesn't have any accessories that come with it. It's great and I love it. Perfect if you don't have to collapse the stroller. When I do need to take it in the car I leave the buggy buddy in the trunk but it's great for using on daily walks around the city. I put my camera, wristlet, baby food, and bottle of water and keys in there and there's still room left over. Highly recommend. Can easily fit on any stroller since it has velcro straps that are adjustable to most style of strollers. Must have if your stroller didn't come with cup holders.<br /><br />I have spilt soda a couple of times so if you have a drink that is in a can I would recommend drinking half of it before putting it in the holder. I put tissue at the bottom just in case and it does the job just fine.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movie has to be the best romantic comedy i have seen in a long time. It's basically about an assistant who marries his overbearing boss so she can stay in the country. And of course they fall madly in love. I honestly was not expecting much from this movie. I thought the age difference between these two would make this seem awkward. I was so wrong. The chemistry between Sandra and Ryan was amazing. And is it just me or was Sandra Bullock made for this type of movie. She also stars in \\"The Lake House\\" which was an amazing movie. I loved this movie. It's this scene where Sandra Bullock is dancing off that song by Lil John and the Eastside Boys, hilarious! This is a must see.
B0011TMGKG|3.0|I bought this for my 5 month old because he loved Freddie the Firefly but had already had Freddie for 3 months so I thought it was time for something new. For some reason he just doesn't seem interested in this toy. It makes a \\"roar\\" when you tip him. He likes to put the hands into his mouth but the teething toys are attached to it so he just seems frustrated by it. Lamaze has great toys but this one was not a winner with my little guy. He has had Freddie since birth and still prefers it to Logan. Go figure.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Many of the reviews both negative and positive have commented on how this Johnny Cash does not sound the same as the Johnny Cash of old.  I think that this is the beauty of this album.  Cash sings every song on this album with emotion and feeling.  There are moments in songs like Hurt and Bridge over Troubled Waters that you can almost feel the regret and pain in this man's voice.  Those who criticize the lack of range and the missed harmonies miss the point.  This is not an album of technically perfect songs.  This is an albulm of emotion and feeling that exposes the soul of a man near the end of his life.  Each song seems chosen to convey a certain feeling that Cash wished to get out before the end.  Take this album for what it is, a record by a great musician who saw his end coming when he still had much to say.  It may not have the same technical merit as Cash's earlier albums, but it portrays an artist putting their heart on record for all to see as they near the end.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Inside a smoky screening room.      STUDIO HEAD  So what do we want to call it?    LACKEY  I was thinking The Political Economy of Network Television: a Cautionary Tale.    SH  Nah. People might figure out it's a political flick. Network sounds snappy.    LACKEY  You're absolutely right, sir.    SH  Besides, if they're paying attention they'll figure it out anyway.      Uproarious laughter from SH and LACKEY as scene fades to black.    ***    Apparently some people think the American moviegoing public will only drink politics if it's mixed with Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid being espionage, gangsterism, or neat biopics). Not so here! Sidney Lumet presents Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay the way it was meant to be: urgent, satirical, and spot-on. This one wears its political guts on the outside, dissecting the anatomy of network television and the relationship between it and the sensationalist acts of the ultraleft groups of the period.     In this respect it bears an eerie resemblance to Fassbinder's [[ASIN:B000FWGYU8 The Third Generation]]. But where Fassbinder targets the RAF, Lumet and Chayefsky take aim at the newsmakers. Person by person you see how the quest for ratings (and thus profits) warps people like worn-out gears.     But be warned: comparing this film with the state of TV today may cause you to echo Howard Beale: \\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\"
B002TYZKIM|3.0|This movie was definitely more hype than substance. The concert would've been awesome. The rehearsal was not.    While it's always interesting to watch Michael's rehearsals, we are watching this as a substitute for the real thing and it's terribly unsatisfying. The producers had touted this as a documentary but it isn't really. If this was a documentary, it lacked a narrative, point, or direction - essentially, what makes a documentary a documentary. It was just a mishmash of scenes slapped together. There was no flow between one scene to the next either and it all comes off as terribly disjointed. What might be called the 'documentary' part consists of a few instructions from Michael to the musicians and dancers, but apart from that, it was mostly about Michael performing on stage. And because this was a rehearsal, he wasn't performing full out. (Even so, his voice was pretty darn good.) But clearly this wasn't meant to be a concert film either, so it's neither here nor there.    I can't imagine that Michael would have been happy with the release of this film. If you're a fan, you would know that Michael would NEVER let anyone see him at anything less than perfect. Not excellent - perfect. And certainly half-measures need not apply.    This is just another act of blatant exploitation by AEG and Sony to make money off Michael. AEG had already recovered their costs more than twice over from the sale of the footage for $60m, and then they get the first $135m from the film (why?) before Michael's estate would even see a penny. If that's not obscene, I don't know what is.    If this movie had been made as a proper documentary (a fleshier, step-by-step 'making of' film), it might've been more acceptable, but this was presented as a pseudo-concert. I'm sure they did the best with what they had, but this did not do justice to Michael nor his fans. One song, the most beautiful song - Speechless - was incomplete (what a travesty!), and many songs from the original setlist were not included (Rock With You, Dangerous, Dirty Diana, Heal the World, We Are The World, and many more). The concert was supposed to be 2.5 hours - you do the math. Some fans from This Is NOT It (who watched the actual rehearsals) said that Michael was weak and flubbing his lines. I wonder if that was the reason those songs were edited out.    The movie tried to show what might have been, and yes, we're sad because we'll never get to see the real thing, but more than showing Mike's genius, this film revealed how unprepared AEG really was. Two weeks before the concert, major set pieces were still missing (they had to be created in CGI on the film), none of the dancers had their costumes and the backup singer and guitarist still didn't know their places on stage or how to move or when to play. Michael already knew all his songs and dance routines (I'm sure he could do them in his sleep) but the others didn't, and he had to instruct them step-by-step because these were not the singers and bandmates of old. It was a whole new cast and they had to learn how to perform with Michael. Many times, Michael had to slow down and wait for them to learn up, or notice that something was wrong but just bite his tongue. I'm not saying that those people are incompetent, I'm saying that they were all so hopelessly behind schedule! Michael had not even seen his costumes yet, much less rehearsed in them.    This is all we'll see of what would never be, but I wonder if it would never have been anyway because the whole production was still so un-ready, a mere two weeks before opening night. Michael would not have wanted anything less than perfect. Is that why he looked so stressed, tired and unhappy and had lost so much weight towards the end (in Human Nature)?    I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is a last look at the biggest genius of our time, and yet, after seeing this, I wish I hadn't because I would rather remember Michael in happier times, and Michael would not have wanted people to remember him giving anything less than 110%.    To think that people are making boatloads of money hawking something that Michael would never have approved of is rather unpalatable. If you don't care about all that, the movie itself is actually just rather mediocre. I might buy the live album if they made one, but the movie, no.
0385504225|2.0|I am really annoyed with myself. I finished Dan Brown's new book and I do not know why I did not stop after 100 pages. It was just awful. Way too much information, in a very lecturing kind of way. It was as if he had an outline for a really good thriller, and then he awkwardly inserted all this information. As if he wrote the info on sticky notes and then just put them on the pages of his outline, willy nilly.<br /><br />Another review said it better than I \\"Dan Brown chooses to use Langdon's inner monologues to tell us every single piece of research he's done for this book. Instead of weaving it into the story he decides to tell us everything rather than showing it to us.\\"<br /><br />The endless pages of detail about Masons and about Noetic science......snore!<br /><br />BTW, I liked every other book of his, even the early ones without Robert Langdon.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Wow, what a movie! Having seen MJ perform twice live during the Dangerous and History World Tours, it's a real pity we didn't get to see his creative genius culminate in This is It!    The movie provides glimpses of what was to be and it would have been a multimedia spectacular! Only someone like MJ could have had the vision of combining song and dance with film, on stage, with aerialists, fireworks and 3D effects.     The movie takes us through the songs that MJ was to perform. We see how he works with the musicians, director and choreographer. We see him laugh, goof up (e.g. forgetting the lyrics), chide, encourage, and most importantly, as he puts it \\"sizzle\\" and \\"simmer\\".    There are moments in the movie you feel his joy as he performs songs from the Jackson 5 era. He breaks into a smile at the end of \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\". He \\"misses his cue\\" as the set for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" begins, but firmly tells the Director that no he didn't miss his cue, he's just \\"sizzling\\" i.e. taking in the audience's adulation. You see the perfectionist at work, but you also see his playful innocence as he enjoys his ride on the cherry picker that was supposed to take him over the crowd.    Of course there were his trademark dance moves and his undeniable talent for singing. He doesn't go all out in every song, but when he does you realize he still had the performer in him.     The movie is bittersweet. You feel his joy as he steps through his rehearsals, but at the end you're left thinking what could have been. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Until then, fans and non-fans will just have to go to the movie theaters and watch glimpses of the concert that never came to fruition.

Grab a bowl of popcorn and pop in, (or turn on), The Big Bang Theory!<br /><br />Jim Parsons stars as Sheldon and Johnny Galecki stars as Leonard, two physicists who live together in an updated version of the Odd Couple.<br /><br />Sheldon is a neat freak with zero sense of humor who can never tell when someone is being sarcastic and very well may be asexual, since he has never had even a hint of attraction for someone that we have seen.<br /><br />Leonard is the more down-to-Earth of the two and it is because of Leonard that friends Howard Wolowitz, (Simon Helberg), and Rajesh Koothrappali, (Kunal Nayyar), even bother to come over, since Sheldon is, at most times, almost intolerable, (but somehow quite enjoyable just the same).<br /><br />Leonard is hopelessly head over heels for his and Sheldon's neighbor, Penny, (Kaley Cuoco), a personification of the \\"dumb blonde\\" stereotype who works at the Cheesecake Factory and serves as the \\"Rachel\\" to Leonard's \\"Ross\\", if this were a Friends scenario. Thankfully, save for one minor hook-up that went nowhere, the sexual tension between them still exists and we are now in season three.<br /><br />Wolowitz is the lovable sleaze of the group.  He has all the one-liners to try and get all the women he can get into bed with him.  He is also the inferior one of the group, since he is \\"only an engineer\\", as Sheldon loves to remind him, while the rest of the group have some sort of academic certification.  He also finds the wackiest of clothing combinations and lives with his mother who we never see but only hear her, (reminiscent of Charlie Brown's teacher), and the exchanges between them are hysterical.<br /><br />Raj has a major problem in that he literally cannot talk to women without the help of alcohol.  If they are in a large group, he is fine, but one-on-one, he literally freezes up.  Hilarity ensues in season 2 when the group are on a train and Summer Glau guest stars.  Raj has a beer to warm himself up to talk to her and Wolowitz is quick to point out that Raj has mistaken the \\"beer\\" for a non-alcoholic drink.<br /><br />In keeping with the Roseanne tradition, (Galecki had his start on the show as Darlene's boyfriend), The Big Bang Theory has had guest stars Laurie Metcalf as Sheldon's holy roller mother and Sara Gilbert in the recurring role of Leslie Winkle, the on-again, off-again bed partner for both Wolowitz and Leonard.  Christine Baranski also guest stars as Leonard's mother who immediately hits it off with Sheldon.<br /><br />The jokes are hysterical, (each episode usually has that one zinger that you'll quote with your friends), the trivia is enthralling and the characters are lovable.  Plus, the commitment to continuity is more impressive than shows previous to this.  Former jokes are revisited further down the line to reinforce previous points and to counter certain actions from occurring in such a way that you'll be saying to yourself, \\"well done!\\"  Plus, the whole group is incredible in terms of acting with the way they regurgitate such long lines of dialogue with no hesitation--truly impressive.<br /><br />If you would like to check out some wholesome entertainment, then you need look no further than The Big Bang Theory!cal.

B000006TRV|4.0|Even though these recordings were made in the 70s, I still believe that \\"Pink Floyd\\" was instrumental in shaping the future of rock.<br /><br />They were far ahead of their time and, with the exception of U2, they are one of the most copied and popular rock bands.<br /><br />Pieces such as- \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" part 1 2 and 3, \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Is Anybody Out There?\\" and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" are all rock classics.

I thought that Kat was a stud and Peeta would never fail to surprise me.  I loved all the characters.  I laughed, cried, and shouted out loud for glee (my husband wanted to put me on prozac!)  I highly recommed this book for EVERYONE.  A Great Christmas present (a few of my friends are getting it).
0142410349|5.0|I revisited this classic upon seeing previews for the new film.  I must say it is just as charming as it was when I first read it as a little girl.  The farmers are deliciously villainous, Mr. Fox is brazenly clever and the other characters are contagiously enthusiastic.  This is a great story that will continue to endure for generations.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see the movie opening on October 27 at midnight and will be seeing it three more times as well as in Imax.  This film was absolutely wonderful and showed the genious that I have loved about this magnificent visionary, singer and dancer.  You must see this movie, I took my 22 and 19 year old daughters who were mezmerized the entire film as well.  I have been a fan of Michael since I was just about born about 8 years into my life 1970.  I immediately reserved my copy of the film to have with me a piece of history that we will never have again a true fan will make sure they have the CD and the DVD.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw it twice today, he is still amazing, his voice amazing, dance amazing even tho he was dancing full out, I love watching him create what he loved doing most in life. He is a genius.. I love him and miss him, I will be buying the DVD for christmas presents and one for myself I can watch this over and over again, It is helping bring closure for me. He is the one and only there will never ever be another...much love & respect... RIP

(see the track listings - three different discs have tracks listed).<br /><br />The deluxe version should be only two discs - but this page is misleading.

0385504225|1.0|If you can read without moving your lips you will be able to call every plot twist and turn in Dan Brown's predictable, overwrought, dreadful continuation of the Robert Langdon saga.  In fact I almost cheered when Robert Langdon \\"died\\", but alas, we are not that fortunate.    A 500+ page marketing pamphlet for Freemasonry?  A derivative mish-mash of other novels?  The last gasp of a tired writer with a tired character?    The conceit of cramming everything into a narrow 10-hour timeframe seemed more contrived this time around.  The problem with a series is that often, by the fifth or sixth novel, the author has had his say.  There is nothing more that can be said about the main character.  Brown has managed to reach this plateau in three books.    The only redeeming feature is that I bought the book on Kindle.  No tree died in the writing of this review.
B000ZELISO|2.0|I am so disappointed in this last installment that I can't properly say here. I thought that the last one was bad, but this takes the cake. I can't for life of me understand why the writer would allow someone to destroy her work like this. What in heavens name is the point of putting in stuff that don't even happen and leaving out pertinent parts. I can hardly wait to see how they destroy Deathly Hallows. I am so disappointed, the books were SOOOOO good and the movies started out good, Does anyone know what happened to the original Dumbledore and the original director? It is just such a let down.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|My first reaction to this movie was \\"is that Johnny Depp playing Buck\\".  Simon Pegg sounds a lot like Johnny when Johnny is pretending to be British.  This movie had a fantastic storyline with the whole parenting and what you would do for your friends/children.  It didn't disappoint because it wasn't cheesy, either.  These movies are ones that I will be sharing with my children one day.  With it on Blu Ray, you can really tell the effort put into it.  Blu Ray makes 4 star movies 5 stars.

1594488916|5.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much , by Allison Hoover Bartlett is a fun, refreshing and quick read.  From the prologue to the afterword, Bartlett successfully keeps the reader intrigued with her story.<br /><br />Bartlett, a journalist,  apparently comes across a four hundred year old book.  As with most avid readers and collectors, her curiosity leads her journalistic instincts to investigate this book, and with the help of a librarian finds out that it is a rare German book about plants, The Kreuterbuch.  Further investigative research leads her to numerous references to rare books and book theft.  The trail continues as she comes across the name of Ken Sanders, a detective set on capturing John Gilkey, one of the most well known successful book thieves.  This book is the goose chase of Sanders and his many attempts to catch Gilkey, and how Bartlett befriends both persons, seeking to find the story of what it is exactly that drives a person to put it all on the line for an object as seemingly simple as a book.<br /><br />What I found interesting in Bartlett's quest was her learning experience of covering this story as a journalist.  The story itself caused her to reflect on her past reading experiences and brought out some very important truths.  For instance, she speaks of her daughter retrieving a book after dropping it in a creek and how she could not bear to part with it writing \\"This book's body is inextricably linked to her experience reading it\\".  Furthermore, she states that \\"A book is much more than a delivery vehicle for its contents...\\".  Bartlett refers to books as \\"historical artifacts\\" and \\"repositories for memories\\".  I would have to agree with her.  People develop an emotional attachment or bond with the memories linked to the physicality of the book.  It becomes sentimental, something of value (even if it is not a rare expensive collectible).  It is what makes a person want to collect books, write stories, and is the drive and inspiration of book lovers.  Her philosophical reflections throughout the book lend character to the author's honesty and credibility.  At one point she mentally debates whether the technology of today will lose that which is captured in having the physical book in one's hands.<br /><br />Other interesting factors that contribute to the brilliance of this book is Bartlett's reference to Freud and the psychological profile of a collector, and how the bookshelf becomes a reflection of who the person is as a person.  It defines them.  Bartlett continues to seek after her story, attempting to understand the difference in how both Sanders and Gilkey live their lives, but yet how their lives become intermingled and both showing characteristics of the same madness.  One set on stealing books, the other set on capturing the thief, both risking it all in the process.<br /><br />Bartlett achieves everything a true storyteller hopes to achieve.  There is love, suspense, truth, passion, and inquisitiveness.  This book is truly an enjoyable read.philosophical reflections throughout the book lend character to the author's honesty and credibility.

0385504225|4.0|Brown clearly has mastered his technique of weaving arcane history with symbolism, and a fun, face paced story.  And he manages to do a great job of leaving his readers feel like they are themselves involved in solving the puzzles that Brown presents in his stories.  In many ways, this book is a worthy successor to his Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />It's just not quite as good.  This is in part because -- like his earlier work Deception Point -- he has his characters go through too many implausible scenarios.  In ways that his craft improved by simplifying the action in Da Vinci, he regressed by doing too much again in Lost Symbols.<br /><br />Similarly (and I will not reveal any of the plot or resolution here), the \\"threat\\" that his lead characters were working to prevent seemed silly to the point of being non-threatening.  To be sure, it's revelation would have harmed a handful of people.  But it hardly rose to the level of damage as that which could have befallen the entire Catholic Church like the scenario laid out in Da Vinci.<br /><br />So while I enjoyed this book almost as much as Da Vinci Code, it did not represent an improvement in his writing.  It's as if Brown had not learned or improved since his last book.  If anything, he regressed a bit.<br /><br />Ah well, the book still has \\"film script\\" written between every line, and should do well in theaters (despite another lame performance by Tom Hanks).  And if it gets people interested in learning more about US History, then it deserve whatever praise it can get.  Even with some minor shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable read.
0385340990|5.0|Everyone in our book group loved this book whichm is a war story, but not a war story. We were impressed with the skill the author displayed in using the correspondence between the characters to develop both the plot and the characters, themselves. This device certainly made the characters and the historical events very real. It's an easy read, but once you start, you don't want to put it down.<br />The love interest was a bit contrived, but added to the suspense and added a light note, as did some of the incidents in what might otherwise have been a dreary story.
0061719544|5.0|As a fan of Craig Ferguson I was very eager to read this book and was not disappointed.  Craig tells it like it was from his beginnings as a young child in Glasgow, Scotland right through his becoming an American.  He makes you feel like you made the journey right beside him. I enjoyed this book tremendously and would like to say:  Welcome to America, Mr. Ferguson.
B00004TL2N|5.0|Pierre Boulez isn't particuarly known for interpretations of Romantic composers. His Mahler cycle has received mixed reviews (I'm actually a fan of his Mahler) and he's recorded some Berlioz. What's interesting is this is the only Bruckner recording he has made...ever. Boulez's detailed-oriented approach works well with Bruckner who in lesser hands (Tintner, Lopez-Cobos) the whole structure of the piece can fall apart. Boulez, without question, exceeds my expectations on this great disc.<br /><br />The Vienna Philharmonic, who have a rich history with Bruckner, play without restraint or confinement. They let the hatchet down and play with fire and intensity. I can compare Boulez's approach with that of Gunter Wand and Riccardo Chailly (who are my two favorite Brucknerians). He keeps a taut line on the orchestra and though he has been criticized in the past for being \\"emotionally cool\\" I can say that this is not the case here. If you don't walk away from this recording thinking \\"Why hasn't Boulez recorded Bruckner more often,\\" then you clearly missed the sonic marvel that is this recording.<br /><br />Without a doubt in my mind, a fine performance of the 8th. Highly recommended.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I watched this series as a kid with my family and now that I am living in another country I thought I would purchase it to combat homesickness. I waited for this new set to come out because of the reviews regarding the last set's packaging and I am glad I did. It comes in a standard size container for full set collections, so it is easy to store in my flat. Despite a mail strike in the UK, Amazon managed to get the order here within a reasonable time. The only issue that I have is that they misspell Sully's first name on the box (Bryon) but not in the online product description. Also, they advertise that people also order the movies, but the movies come in the set (I luckily had read other reviews and did not do this). I can't comment on the quality of the DVDs and extras because I have not watched all of them yet, but I look forward to the experience!
B002OB9KPE|5.0|When I saw that Transatlantic was releasing a new album it came as a pleasant surprise. I had thought that the project was dead and buried with Neal Morse's change to Christian music. It took awhile but I'll tell you, it was well worth it. It's amazing that after all this time when I first listened to the opening of Whirlwind, the 73 minute opus, it sounded just like you would expect Transatlantic to sound. These guys have created their own style and even after 8 years it's still unmistakably Transatlantic. Of course there are some subtle and not so subtle changes. Roine Stolt's guitar work has become much more front and center than in the previous albums, and he has also demonstrated that he can rock on this one. He also has a lot more vocals than in the past. It also seems to me that Neal has taken a more supportive roll on this one. I know some felt that Transatlantic's other 2 albums were just another version of Spock's Beard with Neal's presense felt on nearly every song. Well I'm happy to say with this one, that certainly isn't true. This album sounds much more like a whole band effort, rather than just a showcase for 4 very talented muscians. You can really hear Pete's bass and he even has more vocals. Mike's drumming is amazing as usual. The thing I've always liked about Mike Portnoy, is his ability to dial back his playing to fit the progressive nature of Transatlantic compared to the heaviness of Dream Theater. After listening to this album a couple of times the only drawback and it is a minor one, is that Neal still had to slip in some preachiness. Thankfully it isn't a lot, and can be mostly ignored if you so choose. Those of you who like that sort of thing can listen to Neal's solo albums which are way to preachy for me, but as for Transatlantic, I'm glad he kept it to a minimum. All in all a great album. If you like modern prog then this is definitely one you want to pick up.
0670018651|5.0|If this doesn't at least make you laugh, then you lose. I love this perfume guide because it offers such an extensive selection of reviews to whet your appetite for perfume if you know nothing, and someone/thing to discuss scents with besides your worn out friends and the people on basenotes if you are an avid perfume collector/sniffer. Luca Turin is informative and hilarious without being snobby. Tanya Sanchez is knowledgeable, opinionated, and nostalgic. They also have great anecdotes throughout. I only wish they reviewed more perfumes. =)
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was so excited to receive this DVD! I hadn't seen Snow White in years and would never have though to purchase this Disney movie for my 2 young sons. However, my kids loved it, so it was definitely worth it!  They loved the dwarves, especially Grumpy and Dopey. The new format was beautiful, and Snow White never looked so clear and crisp. It is still a technological marvel, even for our 21st century.     The hand-drawn animation is so fluid and the expressions of the characters is very pleasing to watch. Having this on blu-ray is a special treat because now we can really see and understand Walt Disney's vision. It is trul inspiring and I appreciate all he did to change our entertainment landscape.     I recommend this for entire families and kids of all ages.

0810993139|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid was the first book I read for the readathon, and it was a wonderful way to start the day. It's written in actual diary form, and the delightful middle school boy, Gregory, who narrates loves to draw cartoons. The end result is something in the graphic novel family, but text dominates the graphics. For a taste of what the book looks like, visit Amazon's look inside.<br /><br />As someone who read Captain Underpants, I had relatively low expectations. There is often quite a disconnect between things kids find funny (Captain Underpants, for example) and things adults find funny (are there kids who laugh at 30 Rock as hard as I do?) Diary of a Wimpy Kid is one of the rare books both kids and adults can enjoy. It's certainly a kids book, but I laughed out loud numerous times. It's hilarity is often clever, but there are also a few well-placed low-brow moments.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and I have already requested the next three in the series from the library. If there are young, reluctant readers in your life, please hand them this book. If there are kids who love to read, please hand them this book. Before you do, read it yourself, and laugh.
B000WC39ZE|3.0|I hardly know what to say about this movie.  As a Disney musical, I suppose it hits the mark.  Fun, catchy theme song; dance moves reminiscent of \\"Mary Poppins\\".  However, having first listened to the audiobook read by Andrew Sachs, we were disappointed.  The movie only vaguely resembles the actual story-line of the book, and I'm not sure why they did that.  The original story is vastly superior, and the audiobook version is superb.  Pop it in while you drive around; both you and your elementary-age children will enjoy it.  Watch the movie for fun, but don't ignore the book because you've seen the movie.  It's apples and oranges.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I was shocked after viewing this film that it had received such negative reviews. If you had high expectations like I did, for the summer flick WOLVERINE ORGINS and was sent crashing down, then give this film a try. IT KICKS MAJOR BUTT. There is non-stop action, in many ways it's like X-MEN meets STAR WARS meets LEAGUE OF EXTRODINARY GENTLEMEN. I was blown away by this film. Are you getting the picture that I actually liked it? First of all for being based on a toy franchise and a cartoon, this film exceeds expectations. It is melodramatic, cheesey in some aspects but when it comes down to it you have to been an idiot to realize that it makes the movie that much more fun to watch. Dennis Quaid gives a very hammed up performance as the commander or general, of the Joes. Everytime he spoke I couldn't help but smile to myself. The actress who played the Baroness was by far my favorite. For you parents who might be considering this film for your kids. There is some very low mild language. I think the worse that I actually heard or was made to notice is the word p*ssed off. There is an incredible amout of action violence but if you have already let the kids see SPIDERMAN, X-MEN, STAR WARS EPISODE III, then you should feel safe showing them this film. In some aspect I feel that this film could grow to be a cult classic. As far as the storyline, there are actually a few suprises that I did not see coming. I strongly hope that this will get a much-deserved sequel. I will be buying this dvd and actually a few copies more for Christmas gifts. DON'T MISS OUT!!!!
B000022TSW|5.0|...but this is without a doubt the single greatest musical-comedy of all time. In fact, a solid argument could be made for calling it both the greatest musical of all time AND the greatest comedy of all time, period. This is no hyperbole. It really is that good, that funny, and that intelligent. This is satire of the highest order, Mark Twain for today's generation.
141654917X|4.0|This is a very controversial story; a 13 year old Anna demands her parents and goes to trial for her medical emancipation. She has been genetically designed to fit her sister Kate's needs (Kate suffers from a very unusual kind of leukemia) and has been expected throughout her life to donate tissue, bone marrow, blood, you name it... and now her mother expects her to donate one of her kidneys to Kate.<br />Sara the mother of three and Brian have had it rough yes we can all understand their suffering but do they have the right to neglect their two other kids in favor of their sick daughter Kate?<br />Does Anna have the obligation to risk her own health and her own life to save her sister? Where is the fine line between what is legal and what is ethical in a situation like this?<br />We won't find any correct answers here, this is a struggle where no one can win and in the process you will find yourself rooting for Anna most likely but let me tell you, the ending will shake you to your core, you will cry if you are sensitive because there are no winners and the life of these tormented characters is as real as it can get.<br />I enjoyed the way the book has been written because you get to hear the different voices of all the important characters depicted in the story and you feel you are getting to know them better and better.<br />This is the best book I have read of Jodi Picoult as of yet. Prepare yourself for some surprises.
141041986X|4.0|The Hunger Games is the first book in a dystopian young adult trilogy. The setting is Panem, a country of 12 districts in what was once the United States. To remind its citizens of their power, the Capitol hosts the Hunger Games each year. Through a lottery, one boy and one girl from each district are selected to fight it out until one only person survives.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is intense and harrowing from the opening pages. The story is told from the perspective of Kitniss, a 16-year-old girl who had taken on the responsibility of hunting to feed her family after her father died. Kitniss is simultaneously vulnerable and strong, and I really liked her.<br /><br />Once I started reading, I could not put it down. When I did finish it, however, I had to give pause. While I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, it lacked the depth and message to truly make it a great book. I also found the romantic love triangle storyline annoying; it came out of nowhere. It wasn't timely, and it seemed out of character for Kitniss. Mostly, it bothered me because it was incomplete. The love triangle storyline wasn't fully engaged, and it's clear Collins used the storyline to set the stage for the next book. I love trilogies and series, but I like each book to stand alone if they're released alone. Harry Potter is the perfect example: it was planned to be a seven-book series, and the books build on one another, but each volume is clearly its own story.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a wonderful, engaging story, but it pales in comparison to my favorite dystopian novel, The Giver by Lois Lowry. The Hunger Games is definitely worth reading, but I'm not sure it's destined to be a classic. I also fully admit to having high expectations, both from reading rave reviews about this book and my own enjoyment throughout the book. Sometimes books are so engaging and enthralling, they can't even live up to their own projections. Until the last fifty pages, I was sure I would rate this book five stars, but once I put it down, it didn't quite live up to its own promise of greatness. I am eager to read Catching Fire, the second book in the trilogy. The movie rights for the book have already been purchased, and I think it will translate very well to the screen. I'm curious to see if the movie is shaped as a trilogy as well.wn, it didn't quite live up to its own promise of greatness. I am eager to read Catching Fire, the second book in the trilogy.

She still may have it but it appears her Congested Heart failure will take her from us before it or Alzheimer's does. I had never really been around anyone with Dementia and or Alzheimer's before until my mother in law moved into the facility that she is currently in.  I was a little frustrated in having to tell the same people over and over who I was and why I was there, who the dog was, my mother in laws and lives there with her, etc... I just want to thank the author for writing such a powerful, emotional and insightful book. I now have a greater understanding and empathy for those that have become aflicted with this disease and now have the patience to visit and repeat what ever I am being asked.  For anyone that is facing this situation either as a care giver or as a patient them selves, this book will really help in understanding the cause and effects of this debilitating disease.
B002TOJOVG|4.0|hi i really liked the plot, the story , not all of this just a few small scene  the way he talked in prison made me think of a young hannible lecter palying mind games, his attitude also kind of reminded me of the crazy guy in \\" primal fear\\"  but the way he was and knew what was going on and everon was left cluelss made me think this could of also been a little liek last years \\"untraceable, people dying online and no one knew who it was or how it was, and now yous ee the guy you knwo pretty mcuhw ho it is but  asking hwo int ehw world is he doing this  it was entertaining, ketp  you wondering what would happen next
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Just when you think you have El Stingo figured out, he goes and switches things up again. As his band mates testify, he is the biggest risk taker in the entertainment industry. The easiest thing in the world for him would have been to capitalize on the recent Police reunion tour and come out with a blistering rock album. What does he do? Goes in exactly the opposite direction. I'm not a huge fan of this side of him, but his voice has always been so extraordinary to me that I would listen if he were singing Inna Godda Davida under water. You have to admire the size of his juevos. That said, there are some catchy tunes on here. Soul Cake probably being among the best. The original version of Gabriel's Message is far superior than the re-worked one on this disc. The DVD is entertaining as it explains the process of putting this project together. Some other reviewers are saying \\"not what I expected.\\" Do we EVER really know what to expect from Sting?
0803729227|5.0|My class full of toddlers absolutely loves this book! I have to read it to them 2 times a day. They love the rhyming and have created gestures to act it out. I greatly suggest this book to read to any child!
0307460444|5.0|the GOOD:    1. every cupcake i have made from this book turns out yummy. granted i can only remember making 2 different types: the strawberry cupcakes and the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes.  i have not tried any of the frostings yet, but i'm happy to see that martha states to have the butter come to room temperature (she does not say this in her orange and blue cookbook set and i had an awful day in the kitchen making a cake once).  2. the book looks nice. the front table of contents breaks up the cupcake by type (swirled and sprinkled, dipped and glazed, simple and sweet, etc).  it resembles martha stewart's Cookies book.   3. there is a picture of each cupcake next to each recipe. i'm big on pictures.  4. overall, even though i have \\"BAD\\" comments, i love this book and think it is a great part of my cupcake collection!    the BAD:    1. now the book does resemble her cookie book. but, the cookie book shows a picture of each cookie in the table of contents (fantastic, i know!). this one does not. i guess she ran out of room.  2. i don't use her oven temperatures or times. but that could be because i always just do my own thing. i switch things up and i make minis, or i make jumbos, and i just keep an eye out and take my cupcakes out when the toothpick is clean.  plus, i want my cupcakes to rise but be flat so they are more professional so i change the oven temperatures to make things right for me.  3. i find her instructions a little wordy, but i guess one needs to be specific so the audience makes great cupcakes each time.  4. i would have liked for her to discuss piping cupcakes more.  i'm really into making my swirls look perfect and ended up watching youtube to see what other people do.      the UGLY:    1. nothing!
B001K98MFU|5.0|This title divides fans a lot, and understandably so.  When compared to the original, there is a distinct sameness present as well as a the mostly missing Major.  While this detracts from many people enjoyment of this film, I still liked the characters, and plot enough to wholeheartedly recommend a viewing.  Though not up to the standard of the original (and really, not much is) this effort forwards the tale exceptionally well.
044651506X|5.0|CIS? Why, it means \\"call in sick\\" of course. This novel is one of those that once you get into it, you can't get out of it. There are twists and turns, plots, subplots, and seemingly discontiguous pieces of the puzzle. John Corey puts it all together -- and if you're paying attention, you can too -- but you have to keep all the pieces in your head at the same time. The dramatic climax is a little melodramatic, but the rest of the book makes up for it. If you like this one, read all of DeMille's John Corey books.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|Disc 2: rare treat. Disc 1: just another recycled hits collection. I fear this is just the first in a long line of releases that will dole out demos and unreleased songs from the vault to us fans as if we were starving dogs looking for scraps. Shameful. MJ would never permit such a thing. There is no doubting the talent of MJ in full force on Disc 1, and I did enjoy the acoustic demo of She's Out Of My Life, but the rest should have stayed hidden. MJ would have wanted it that way.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The movie worked without flaw and looked great on my tv, no problems playing it. Thanks for the DVD.
B001JDS7CU|4.0|Most people break their reviews of this product down in 2 parts, picture and content.  I think this dvd has been praised very highly due to both but even more so concerning picture quality.  It is extremely popular for \\"Jaw-dropping\\" detail, visually.<br /><br />The content is great and yes, the narration is superb.  Sounds like he should be narrating Lord of the Rings or something.  Very, very interesting so far.  I have viewed a disc and a half so far.  I will update when I finish watching.  The exploration is fantastic (most shots are by helicopter it seems)and the history is splendid.  I am learning so much.  It is very much about the history and learning about the world.  I love the strange and bizarre creatures that I never knew existed.  So far, the animal \\"hunts\\" are very tastefully done.  I am not a fan of seeing animals suffer (even though it is nature).  Just the knowledge and experience alone is well worth this package.<br /><br />The picture I found to be slightly disappointing.  It is recorded in 1080I.  Being a Blu-Ray, I expected 1080p. Expect the detail to be exactly like watching this on Hi-def tv broadcasting (on Discovery channel or something).  There is some grain here and there, and from what I have been experiencing lately with a lot of Blu-Ray's, is that the detail is subject to light.  In dark scenes the picture will look average with some grain and blurriness, meanwhile with scenes of natural sunlight the detail will be incredible.  Every now and then there are scenes with great lighting and detail that make me go \\"Wow\\".  But it is not uniformly throughout the entire dvd.  Your not going to be sitting down the whole time with your mouth open.  More of like an open-closing sort of thing.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed was the contrast flickering.  In some episodes the contrast seems to go in and out like a pulsing set to every second.  I noticed this in dark scenes and found it to be VERY distracting.  I haven't checked other reviews for this, but I find this extremely unacceptable.<br /><br />For what it is worth, it is a good buy.<br /><br />Viewed with a Sony 1080p lcd tv and slim ps3.is extremely unacceptable.    For what it is worth, it is a good buy.    Viewed with a Sony 1080p lcd tv and slim ps3.
B002OLV3CW|5.0|So here we are again with yet another re release package. And as usual there is the expected bonus cuts and the DVD. Normally this weans your getting a few mediocre songs or a lame radio edit. And the DVD is just a 15 minute look at what you should already know about your 'fav' band...not in this case!    ADTR took the time to give us a re release worth picking up. Not just listening to, but owning. The 2 bonus tracks are acoustic versions of 2 songs i would never imagined acoustic at all!! It shows a good sideof he band they dont normally get to express. I was kinda disappointed that they didnt put the Fray cover on as well, but thats a small oversite.    The DVD is packed w/ a full live set and a barrage of bonus features...which total up to 3hours of Pop Core goodness! I really cant divulge all the goodies here...And the packaging is AMAZING! They really stepped it up for this release, with expanded artwork, a 52 page booklet and a cool lil surprise for collectors...    Hands down this is a re release totally worth the $$. So do yourself and the band a favor and pick this up!
0385341008|4.0|I found the novel a bit tedious at first but stuck with it and am glad I did. The letters were an unusual and good way to tell a story. I liked the anecdotes and history, admired Elizabeth McKenna and thought it ended well.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|The Blu-Ray version of Star Trek was released in Australia yesterday (28th October), not sure why it is taking so long to be released in the U.S. On a scale of one to ten it is a 6.5 (not the movie but the packaging), you do get the 3rd disc digital copy which allows you to download the entire film to your iTunes (iPod) or PC equivalent, but who cares - you can because you can. this is a film designed for the big screen (it was released for Imax as well), so why bother with an iTunes version. Another stunning revelation - and this rumour is fast tracking the world. ... Seems the only two TRUE blu-ray releases are (01) Star Trek and (02) Wall-e - seems (as the rumour goes) all other blu-ray discs have simply been up-scaled from standard definition tape sources. It also seems that Blu-ray sales are floundering bigtime - no one really cares. Majority of folks I chat to about Blu-ray have no idea what it is. Best you purchase an up-scaling standard DVD player for $70, and let it create the sharper images. BTW Star Trek Blu-ray version in Australia sells for $30.00Aust - it sells on Amazon for $17.00US. Paramount are famous in this country (Australia) for excessive pricing.
0763619612|5.0|Shipment was great...received in super condition... my first grade  elementary art students loved it!
B0024FAR5M|4.0|This is a VERY good series, worth owning.The series starts off a little shaky from(And I'm gonna catch hell for this)the first couple of episodes because of (And I like her too)Katey Sagal.What the hell?? She runs around this series like Michael Corleone's sister in Godfather 3! Some IMPOSSIBLE stuff goes on around this series, but thankfully the tension between Jax(BADASS)and Clay keeps this show DAMN interesting.Did I say Jax is badass? Worth owning and season 2 (Can't wait for it on dvd)so far, WAAAYYY superior.
B002MBAJ4M|3.0|I have heard everything the Mule has released, starting with their debut back in 1995. My first listen of \\"By A Thread\\" left me feeling disappointed, but then I realized this is the way I felt listening to all of their albums since \\"Dose\\". (In my mind, nothing can compete with the power and emotion of their first two albums.) Upon listening a second and third time I began to appreciate this album a little more, but the disappointment never completely faded. Each song, while not sounding similar, has the effect of melding into the next - like a dramatic movement. There are some boring moments, but things usually shift into an interesting idea or mood and the song is rescued. The album feels organic, much less riff-driven than on previous efforts - though the band has been moving in this direction (at least on record) since The Deep End project. Matt Abts exorcises his inner John Bonham, pounding out the most Zeppelin-esque beats he has ever created. The new bass player adds a raw, pulsating punch, recalling Allen Woody at times, and others, Mel Schacher from Grand Funk Railroad. Warren does a good job of not overwhelming each song with guitar, dropping back into a variety of sometimes-funky rhythmic approaches. Yet, a few songs do seem under-crafted - particularly when Warren goes acoustic. Two or three cuts, quite frankly, sound like outtakes. This is one of those albums best listened to from start to finish. It's a promising, if not undercooked, beginning to yet another chapter for the band.
B000001EL3|2.0|When I was in High School I borrowed this from a friend, I couldn't wait to get home and listen to what I heard was a classic 70's rock album. I listened to it and, What is this?? This album sucks. Detroit Rock City and Shout It Out Loud are are the only OK songs, the rest of the songs are laughable and just embarrassing to hear. I even listened to the song samples here at Amazon before writing this review and I have to admit they still sound terrible.  Many people say this is their best album, but I actually think KISS Love Gun is a little better, because the previous albums were awful.    I respect all the KISS fans, but I think they are one of the most overrated bands in history. Other 70's bands were years ahead of KISS and had much better albums than Destroyer. I'm talking about Boston's debut album and Don't Look Back, Bon Scott Era AC/DC's Let There Be Rock, UFO's Phenomenon, other material by Deep Purple, Rush...    Overrated Band, Overrated Album.
0066620996|5.0|If I had to recommend just one business book to someone it would be this one.  There are so many concepts here that I use on a daily basis e.g. \\" good is the enemy of great\\". I do not want to be \\"good\\" anymore and react strongly when anyone in my team aspires to being good.<br /><br />My wife Lola is a mother who \\"washes her cottage cheese\\". To me that says is all. She is a great mother. The Hedgehog concept, the Stockdale paradox it goes on and on.<br /><br />The real message here, which is not new but which is eloquently understated here, is that success in business is about who you are not what you do or how you do it. That was a pretty big breakthrough for me.<br /><br />It was underlined when a former business partner scoffed at my suggestion that they read the book and learn from its principals and they personify the \\"how not to do it\\" part of the book i.e. good companies not great ones.<br /><br />So..... fascinating stuff with real world applications and a wider, almost spiritual, message.

0786868724|2.0|As an avowed atheist, I experience the occassional well-meant attempt to get me to believe in something. I've received several copies of the Book of Mormon, Mere Christianity, more Bibles than I can count, two Jesus and Buddha comparisons and even a lone copy of the terrible Left Behind series opener. Over the weekend a sweet friend gave me a copy of Have a Little Faith to attempt to gently win an previous argument we have had regarding my absolute dismissal of religion as deleritous to the human condition.     Despite my lack of faith, I will attempt to objectivly review this book. It is lukewarm pablum spoon fed to masses who have never been exposed to true profundity. This is The Notebook of religiousity. Although I can't agree with the reviewer who gave the book a resounding one star for its dangerous premise of belief in anything being enough to deliver a soul, I do agree with his charge that this book is the Oprah-izing of religion and will up the anti by arguing its the mediocritizing of fiction. The rabbi is a flat character who fails to offer any promised wisdom and Albom's narration is lacking in originality or beleivability.    I slogged through ths stinker to the very end, and I have to say it serveed to only deepen my resolve that faith blinds man to travesties like blowing fifteen dollars (including tax) on drivel. The reason I gave two stars is that I recognize I might be overly harsh due to my lack of belief, so I am attempting to be kind by recognizing the occassionally humorous moment in the novel.
0307269981|1.0|I loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - stayed up reading until late into the night to finish it.  This book is a struggle to stay engaged with.  I'm not sure whether it is the translation or the original, but the dialogue is wooden and the prose functional at best. I didn't notice that the writing was so substandard in TGWTDT but maybe it was because the plot was so much better.  It takes 200 pages for the plot to start in TGWPWF and Larsson seems to be confused about whether he is writing pornography or a thriller.  And is he serious - the murderees are about to publish a book and thesis respectively that will expose the participation of members of the police, judiciary, various criminal gangs etc in the illegal sex trade and it's not clear that this could have contributed to their murders?!  Plus I can't really believe that any police force would be as incompetent to hit on Lisbeth as the murderer on the evidence available. Larsson treats the reader as a moron who is not going to grasp the issues he's concerned with unless he spells them out in capitals. I was truly appalled by Lisbeth's transformation - breast augmentation!!!! - she is a completely different character from the person sketched in TGWTDT and I found her new incarnation repellant. As for Blomqvist, I can only assume that Larsson was creating a fantasy alter ego - he is not a convincing character.<br /><br />I will probably read the third book to see if things improve, but this was a huge disappointment.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|If you're still grieving over the King of Pop's untimely death, you have to see this movie!  You can really feel his spirit, his sweetness, and his genius in this footage.  R.I.P. Michael!  We love you!
0061914177|5.0|If you're ready to utilize social media tools to launch your business - or bring your existing business into the 21st century - this book is an absolute MUST READ!!    Gary Vaynerchuk has been vblogging on winelibrary.tv for some time now - bringing great wine knowledge to the masses.  What I didn't know is the businessman side of Gary, and his passion for sharing his knowledge about his business with others looking to crush it.    I'll keep the review short - JUST READ IT.  It's a fast and important read.  I'm giving it to several friends for the holidays - you should too!
B002H3F7F6|4.0|This album, though it loses steam as it proceeds, is a very creative piece of work.  Sting goes after the darker elements of the winter season - the intense cold and gloom of the northern climes - but he also captures the mystical elements of Christmas-tide.  I was disappointed in his rendering of Lo! How a Rose ere Blooming, but his take on Cherry Tree Carol captures the drama of this particular old tale of Joseph, Mary and the unexpected child.  If you want a contemplative, serious Christmas album with unusual music, this is one to buy.
0385504225|5.0|I'm a bit disappointed that so many reviewers focused on comparative criticism, although it isn't too likely that many _Lost Symbol_ readers are reading Brown's work for the first time.  I did find the book almost impossible to put down thus finding Brown a genius at motivational creativity.  However, I did get lost in the minutiae occasionally.  As I read, I could see the movie unfolding before my eyes.  Whether or not this was Brown's intention is moot.  As a recent, first time visitor to D.C., I am pleased to have visited so many key places and could refer to our travel photos to return there along with Langdon et.al.  I did correctly identify of the villain and the rationale.  It is a stand-alone novel, and great fun.  I find all of Brown's work pure pleasure and quite compelling.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I have to say I was somewhat skeptical about this book given the middle of the road ratings on Amazon.  However, this is one of my favorite Dan Brown books.<br /><br />I would say this book fits more into the \\"Tom Clancy\\" genre than the more famous Dan Brown books (Lost Symbol, Da Vinci Code, etc.).<br /><br />Definitely a great book that is hard to put down.
B002R0EIVI|5.0|I finally was able to see \\"THIS IS IT\\" today and there are no words to explain how amazing it was.  Michael Jackson was much more than merely a \\"genius.\\"  He had a very special gift and loved sharing it with the world.  Seeing him in person would have been an unbelievable experience, but seeing him \\"behind the scenes\\" was even more extraordinary.  He genuinely loved what he did, from the beginning thoughts to the end results!  Not only was he a sincerely kind and loving person, he had incredible talent to go with it.  This world was truly blessed to have had him a part of it!
0380730405|5.0|Daphne du Maurier's most famous book, Rebecca is told through the eyes of the young second wife of Maxim de Winter. Previously an unworldly companion, she is intimidated by Maxim's house, servants, friends and, most of all, his first wife Rebecca, a beautiful, charming, talented woman who had died, apparently in a boating accident.<br /><br />A haunting tale of mystery and suspense.
0739309560|5.0|I was going through withdrawal since the last Dan Brown book.  This one does not disappoint.  I usually get the audio books.  I know it is a good story when I miss my exit!  Enjoyed it very much.
B0000BWTK3|5.0|Those are for sure great performances. Very good for Grieg but thrilling   for Schumann. This is one of the best recordings of Schumann`s Piano Concerto   in modern sound. This couple (Grieg-Schumann) is much more preferable than Zimerman/Karajan`s for DG. Absolutely recommended.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|This season comprises only nine episodes, so it might seem as though it's over before it really gets started.  But, after having watched many shows with 26 episodes per season and wishing some of those episodes hadn't been made (Star Trek: The Next Generation, for example), this show comes across as tightly written and focused. A shorter season forces the writer(s) to make every episode great.  When you've got to bang out 26 episodes, you're bound to get some clunkers, which isn't the case here.<br /><br />The show starts with Sarah and John Connor hiding in middle America, where they live with Sarah's unsuspecting boyfriend, a nice guy who knows nothing about Sarah and John's past.  Pretty soon, a \\"bad\\" Terminator rolls into town and attempts to take John out at his high school, where he's helped by a \\"good\\" Terminator, played by Summer Glau.  That pretty much sets up the start of the show, with the Connors and the \\"good\\" Terminator taking flight.  I won't spoil the story for you, but only say that the pace picks up from there.<br /><br />Screenwriter Josh Friedman has done a good job fleshing out the gap between Terminators 2 and 3 here.  Lena Headey (Sarah), Thomas Dekker (John), Summer Glau (Good Terminator), Richard T. Jones (FBI agent), Garrett Dillahunt (Bad Terminator), and Dean Winters (the boyfriend) all do a fantastic job.  Glau is especially convincing in one episode where she contemplates killing one of John's high-school friends.  Most surprising is Brian Austin Green of \\"90210\\" fame.  He plays Kyle Reese's older brother and appears to have matured from his younger days into a solid actor.<br /><br />I didn't see any cool liquid-metal action in the first season.  Maybe in season two.
0316017922|2.0|Gladwell's argument is too one-sided.  Perhaps because he is a journalist or perhaps because he is attempting to refute 100's of \\"great man who came from nothing\\" stories, he ignores ambition and downplays all other aspects of success except lucky breaks and 10,000 hours of practice.  That seems to me just as overly simplistic as basing success entirely on intelligence (whether social or IQ).    Of course, since cultural biases identification is also an important aspect of this book- I should admit that I am Southern.  I am also a pacifist, an academic and a physician.  So I do find the supposition (based on 19th century Appalactia and some 1970's frat boys) that I come from a culture of violence based on insulted honor- well insulting.
0385341008|5.0|I did not initially like the book.  The letters seemed a bit confusing and I just could not imagine reading an entire book of letters.  However, after about the third or fourth letter I was hooked.  I found this style of writing very interesting and loved the story.  I have recommended this book to many people.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I am a Dan Brown fan and have read The Da Vinci Code 4 times and will definitely read it again after the disappointment I experienced in The Lost Symbol.  I Have had a fascination for the Masonic Order all my life since my father was a 33rd degree mason and was installed as worthy master of his lodge.  He was also a Shriner. He would never answer my questions about masonry which always fueled my fascination.      So here I thought Dan Brown was going to finally answer some of my life long questions and I couldn't have been more thrilled.Brown rambled on and on about The Lost Mysteries and the lost word and the bible being the true vessel of the ancient wisdom. I recently spent several hours reading the bible and I think you can mold your understanding of that great book depending on your personal perspective.  I got caught up in the historical details and of course the psalms and the prophets.  Contrary to many believers, there are other great works of wisdom.  I am not certain if the Masonic Rituals Mr. Brown depicted are accurate or not, but he wrote at the beginning that all the agencies and things he were about to reveal were true. I have to do my own research now for sure.    This was a page turner because the chapters were so short, but the villain, Mal'ok was not entirely believable. and I was disappointed with his great revelation at the end  of his place in the story. He was thoroughly flawed and broken in some perverse way. I think we readers could have done very well without his revelation and accepted him as just a sick and flawed individual.  Robert Langdon was just too obtuse and handled his skepticism poorly He refused to \\"get it\\", whatever \\"it was supposed to be about the symbolon and the codes on the pyramid.    This book is not one I would read again.  I hope Brown's next novel is more believable. I was disappointed overall.    I also thought the ending dragged on at least 40 pages longer than it needed to.  I kept waiting for it to end.  The bookcould have used some thorough pruning with a grease pencil.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Unsure of what to expect (having never really listened to the Beatle's besides '1'), this CD is fantastic.  Every song is enjoyable, and I find myself just keeping it on repeat.  It's the only Beatle's CD I have, and makes me want to get more!  Don't hesitate on this one.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|She's smart, devious and controlling; and way beyond 'creepy kids and her Bad seed' references. Dark Castle is consistent with production values and content; so there should be no surprises. Should be...However, the 'taboo' story, tastefully handled, is still edgy for many. Still, it's popular, It is in a 'classic' film mode; meaning it is reserved a bit.. The A/V is in a classic mode but still sports the Stuff!  I had fun.
B000KQF6X0|4.0|What a stunning display of the beauty of high-definition. Most Ridley Scott films are visual extravaganzas and the Blu-ray treatment here is quite special. The sheen and polish of Scott's urban landscapes is a sight to behold. Black Rain is almost like a neo Tokyo, anime version of Blade Runner, only filmed in Osaka! It's pretty amazing just how much the look of Blade Runner was influenced by Asian metropolises and then Blade Runner influenced the look of a lot of anime in return. Black Rain is total cheese, a completely by the numbers American cop movie filled to the brim with excessive cliches and all that the genre implies but it's a masterpiece of art design and production values. It simply reeks of Hollywood excess and gratuitous surfaces polished to perfection. The look of the movie on Blu-ray makes your mouth water if you are a cinema enthusiast. Rare instances from the sleazy 1980s gave us such absolutely stunning and sophisticated urban imagery captured on film and unfortunately all for nothing.<br /><br />Compare this movie with it's art design predecessor Blade Runner and you'll see just how empty and decadent Black Rain truly is. It's a buddy cop movie made by highly paid Madison Avenue designer types. Jan De Bont is the cinematographer here, ( he went on direct \\"Speed\\" and \\"Twister\\" ), and he knows exactly how to get that perfect look that is the imprimatur of nearly every Ridley Scott production. All the Ridley trademarks are here in evidence, the smoke emitting from the streets, the endless neon lights, the motorcycles, the reflections off all metallic surfaces, the rain soaked atmosphere. Everything is hip, flashy and beyond decadent. However the plot is basic police story stuff, the characters are cardboard cut outs that the talented cast somehow manage to humanize and the subsequent revenge narrative is all too familiar.<br /><br />Beyond the stunning high-def visuals, the audio is also very good and the special features are terrific. The actors and the director discuss the shoot and how difficult it was filming in Osaka, Japan with all the rules and regulations governing film production there. Ridley Scott, Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia try to stress how much they care about this movie but it won't convince me or anyone with a brain that this film is nothing more than a gorgeous looking, atmospheric mess. But what a fantastic looking mess! The two Japanese male leads who play counterpoint to the Americans portrayed by Douglas and Garcia are also terrific actors. Ken Takakura as the good cop and Yasuku Matsuda as the villain. Matsuda died shortly after this film wrapped and I suppose Black Rain is as good a vehicle to showcase his talents to the international film world as any foreign actor could hope for.

Ridley Scott, Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia try to stress how much they care about this movie but it won't convince me or anyone with a brain that this film is nothing more than a gorgeous looking, atmospheric mess. But what a fantastic looking mess! The two Japanese male leads who play counterpoint to the Americans portrayed by Douglas and Garcia are also terrific actors. Ken Takakura as the good cop and Yasuku Matsuda as the villain. Matsuda died shortly after this film wrapped and I suppose Black Rain is as good a vehicle to showcase his talents to the international film world as any foreign actor could hope for.

B002S0OBFK|3.0|I heard about this movie more than a year ago. I read about it in an independent filmmaker magazine. At the time the studio that bought the movie was thinking of shelving this flick and letting the director remake it as a mainstream horror film with a real budget. Thankfully they came to their senses and released it \\"Blair Witch\\" bare bones style aided by an underground marketing blitz. Obviously it worked as this $15,000 film is raking in the big bucks nationwide. I knew as soon as I read about this movie over a year ago that it had the makings of a Blair Witch type reception at the box office because people are deeply uninformed and can easily fall victim to the hype of real events or supposed true stories. The whole Blair Witch marketing scheme was based on lying to potential moviegoers and getting them to think that it was real footage of real events and real people died. Thankfully \\"Paranormal Activity\\" does not fall to such pathetic gimmicks in it's aim to make the big bucks.    I did not want to see this film until it was released on DVD but a friend that I had not seen in years suggested we attend a midnight screening of the movie. This was weeks before it opened nationwide. We waited for more than an hour in line, ( I have never waited for a movie before in my entire life and I'm a movie buff ), but the wait wasn't so bad as it gave us a chance to catch up and talk film. Upon entering the movie theater, it was packed wall to wall with people. I live in a well known college town so I knew immeadiately that the marketing gimmicks had worked and this movie was going to do blockbuster business when released coast to coast. The audience was full of drunks and stoners of all kinds. Films like this and Blair Witch should be watched in either of two ways... either with a bunch of drunks and stoners at a midnight screening or alone by yourself in an empty theater.     The film itself was exactly as I imagined it would be. Unpretentious, basic scares, very minimalistic design as ordained by budgetary concerns. I am a filmmaker myself and of course it's great to see a bare bones film like this succeed financially in a sea of disgusting mainstream slime like the \\"Saw\\" series. I was delighted that Paranormal Activity beat up on the latest Saw flick this past weekend at the box office. However, an underdog success story still does not make a good movie. This film is not even remotely scary, even though all the drunks and stoners kept jumping up at even the silliest scares! It was more about a communal atmosphere than a genuinely scary movie, which are very rare indeed.    The characters were your standard issue boring twenty somethings living together in unwedded bliss until a demonic presence begins to haunt their house. From then on all the horror cliches you known and are tired to death of start creeping into the movie. I couldn't wait for everyone to die. It's a long time coming. The film drags in the middle portion and we the viewers are never allowed outside of the house. This has nothing to do with the ridiculous plot device that the demon will follow the woman anywhere she goes. It has everything to do with the fact that the movie was made on the tightest of budgets and could only afford one location. Are these characters at all realistic? If a demonic presence was messing with you in your house, would you not skip at least a night or two in your home? Maybe go to a friend's house, hotel or something? Give me a break! Anyway, some of the effects shots were pretty sweet for such a low budget film.    How does this movie rank against \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"? I really did not like Blair Witch upon it's release and I resented the fact that the marketing department had to lie to people to buy the product. I research things like this so of course I was not fooled but let me tell you... back in 1999 when Blair Witch came out, I was working in a video store and people came up to me all the time as they were renting Blair Witch and asked me, \\"Is this for real? Did these people die?\\" Yes, human beings are that gullible and idiotic and marketing people prey on that. After I watched Paranormal Activity, I went and saw Blair Witch again for the first time in a decade. I greatly enjoyed Blair Witch more the second time around without all the fuss. Blair Witch has a vital ingredient that horror films should absolutely have and that Paranormal Activity sorely lacks and that ingredient is atmosphere. Spending an hour and a half in a house with two idiots in their bedroom is far less atmospheric than a group of four trecking through the woods and getting lost for days. The location shooting is vital for Blair Witch, night time, daytime, surrounding the actors with nature and pitting them against the elements and the supernatural horrors around them. Plus that film not only had consumer grade camerawork but also 16mm black and white footage to give the film an artsy look. For my money, Blair Witch still keeps the crown for tiny budgeted horror films with over the top marketing hype! Paranormal Activity is an average boo and bump in the night flick. You won't miss much by waiting for the DVD release. Take care, movie fans!

B001GCUO1Q|2.0|Now that we know how good big-budget movies can be that are based on comic book material... it is more than just a tad disappointing to see the filmmakers behind X-Men Origins: Wolverine still resort to such astounding bad taste and lack of ambition. This is one of those \\"it's all about the money folks\\" type of deals. The producers know that no matter how bad a particular product will be, there will be hordes of consumers ready and willing to give up their greenbacks to satisfy their appetite for cheap entertainment. Well, it was expensive for the filmmakers at least. [...]    Perhaps I'm being too harsh, judging this flick against The Dark Knight and Watchmen is bad form. Wolverine should be judged against the X-Men flicks, all of which are far more variable in quality than Dark Knight or Watchmen. But even against the X-Men movies, Wolverine fails handily. In the X-Men trilogy, Wolverine was strangely the main character even though he had no right to be. He is not leader of the X-Men, he is an outsider but he was always taking up most of the screentime because he's the most popular and in films full of fantastical superpowers, he was the only identifiable character for the audience.     Ok then, audiences want the focus on Wolverine, give them a spin-off. So in this Wolverine origin movie we should rightfully get the spotlight almost exclusively on Logan and instead much screentime is wasted parading a whole gaggle of extras when it should just have Sabretooth as the main villain and that's it. We don't need an extra dozen characters! Perhaps the most offensive character in the film was this movie version of Deadpool which had almost nothing to do with the real Deadpool. When I was a kid, Deadpool was my favorite Marvel character, well him and Wolverine that is. Hearing that Deadpool would make a big appearance in this film I looked forward to it all the while knowing that Hollywood would screw it up big time and screw up they have! Casting Ryan Reynolds was mistake number one but fine, give the actor a chance. But why does Deadpool look like some reject version of Baraka from the Mortal Kombat videogame series when Deadpool in the comic has one of the sharpest, flashiest designs in the Marvel universe?    The insipid blandness of this whole movie just irks me. The chase scenes and action were all second-rate. The helicopter attack with the blades was one of the few genuine fun moments of the movie. The climactic battle scene on Three Mile Island was a case of we've seen this a million times before. The movie was still a blockbuster, made plenty of money but not enough I think to warrant another Wolverine film. Time to retire this franchise. I'm still up for a standalone Deadpool movie, provided that it has nothing to do with this travesty.

B001QOGYFE|2.0|I've been hearing about this movie for many years. It's an adaptation of a little known graphic novel and it was in pre-production for almost a decade. Reese Witherspoon was initially attached to this project. Reese as a federal agent is an even more ridiculous thought than Kate Beckinsale in the finished product. The buzz for this film turned bitter and hopeless as it was postponed again and again. Finally seeing the film, you get exactly what you expect. An interesting premise of a lone law enforcement officer stuck on the most remote continent on the planet having to capture a killer who has just committed the first murder in the history of Antarctica. Solid premise leads to lame results. First off we do not need any of these flashbacks to flesh out Kate's character and her past in Miami. Totally irrelevant to waste time on this. Second of all there are no compelling villains here, there is basically just a bare bones plot about capturing some killer lurking amidst the snow and ice. There is nothing supernatural or extraterrestial here either, so forget about that.    Some of the photography is lovely, especially the shots that don't rely too heavily on computer generated imagery to stress the fakery of this whole enterprise. Kate does an admirable job with the limited material. The shower scene was totally gratuitous. The best thing about making a movie set in Antarctica and starring an attractive woman is the perverse pleasure a director can take in having the female lead walk around in heavy coats and sweaters, never showing any skin much to the chagrin of teenage boys. Unfortunately this director just couldn't resist one short shower scene. You don't even see anything, it's merely an acknowledgement of hey, there's a woman in this movie, let's shamelessly give her a shower scene.    I enjoyed Tom Skeritt's presence in the film as he gives it more dignity than it deserves. There is one really good scene between him and Kate. I won't spoil it for you but there's real emotion in it. It involves some frostbite and a medical procedure.    Well, too bad. Another film with a cool premise, great setting, a good female lead and some solid photography passes through the Hollywood junk machine and comes out as a disposable product. Filmgoers passed on this and with good reason. \\"Whiteout\\" will find some kind of small audience as a DVD rental or on late night television in the future.
B000002IO1|4.0|This is a typical example of the rock music that was around in the late 80's.  The start of when the female vocalist was taken serious.  Alannah has the voice to make you sit up and take notice.  With a great voice, mixed with catchy song including the huge hit Black Velvet, it is definately worth a listen.
B0021L8US0|2.0|First point, this is a review of the movie only in it's theatrical release. Don't blame me if you're reading this to get a description of the Blu-ray or DVD version. You should know by now that the numbskulls at Amazon throw together all movie reviews into one steaming pile. Speaking of steaming piles... have you seen District 9?    I went to see this movie against my better judgment. Thankfully I didn't pay to see it. Moviegoers were raving about a new terrific science-fiction film. A bad sign! Many critics were jumping on the bandwagon and giving this one too easy a pass with glowing reviews. Another bad sign! My family and friends were recommending this movie to me. Yet another bad sign! As much as I love sci-fi films, especially the intelligent variety, not the blow stuff up variety, District 9 turned out to be a waste of time since not only does it fall into the blow stuff up variety, it puts the audience through that in a most deplorable fashion. It masquerades as an intelligent premise with perhaps even a social conscience, addressing issues like race and apartheid. But apparently all the film really wants to do is turn into a Michael Bay flick and blow stuff up. Yes, the action did look like it belonged in a rapid fire cut-up and hideously edited Michael Bay extravaganza. Michael Bay movies have a lot of sheen and slickness about them and instead District 9 goes for the dirty, grimy, greasy, ugly look but the action and editing style is right out of Transformers.    All the characters are hideous and dehumanized beyond any consideration. I understand you have to have villains in such dopey movies but here everyone is a villain. Just like in real life, right? Ugh. Why is the father-in-law of the main character turned into a cartoon Nazi instantly? Why are the bald-headed goons in this movie all the same? Why are the aliens so reprehensible? Let's not forget the native South Africans who are all insane criminals. There is not a single likable character in thisentire cheesy videogame, I mean movie. District 9 continually reminded me of any numbers of recent videogames. The latest Halo, Killzone 2, Resident Evil 5. The action and frenetic camera never stops and there are constantly shootouts throughout the entire running time. I know some people love this kind of entertainment but please watch Michael Bay instead to get your lowlife kicks. Instead of a film showcasing our civilization colliding with another, we get unintelligible action sequences that seem to have been ripped off from some generic first-person shooter!     The CGI in the film is fairly awful but you'd better get used to it as the CGI is showered over this movie's running time wall to wall. The only CGI I liked were long shots of the alien spacecraft. The alien creatures themselves are the most derivative design one could possibly come up with. Basically huge bipedal cockroaches with disagreeable manners. This is director Neill Blomkamp's first feature film and it shows on many levels. He has no idea how to direct a compelling narrative, work with actors or orchestrate an action sequence. This film is a total mess. It did make a significant amount of money seeing as how mainstream moviegoers will feed at the trough of slimy entertainment. The budget was $30 million and it made $115 million in domestic grosses, so be on the look out for an annoying cash in sequel. This kind of sleazy, badly put together entertainment is merely the norm nowadays and not the interesting premise, nor the name of Peter Jackson as executive producer can save this CGI laden gimmicky mess. It's still not as heinous as the usual Michael Bay flick but mainstream audiences gobble up that dreck with even more glee. Transformers 2 amassed $400 million in domestic grosses alone! Take that, you stupid people who actually care about cinema as an artform! Garbage rules. Garbage served up hot and fresh is what the people, ( mindless prawns ), want and delight in. I still have hope that goodscience-fiction films are possible even in today's gutter movie culture. This was a missed opportunity by all involved.
0446698342|3.0|This was my first Sparks book and I wanted to like it. I downloaded the sample to my Kindle and it grabbed me so I bought it. It started good, I loved the characters. But the story never went anywhere and became predictable. I had figured out the ending about a quarter of the way into the book, and was actually disappointed when I was right. I felt like I was reading the script to one of those cheesy Lifetime movies. It was just ok. It wasn't terrible, he has a good writing style, but this one was just a bit boring. I'll give him one more shot but I won't be re-reading this one.
B00275EHCI|3.0|It's kind of depressing to constantly have so many sci-fi films in the multiplexes and never a good one. Take this latest example of average, middling mediocrity. The idea is always a good hook. This time humans have abandoned their daily lives to robots called surrogates. The surrogates live the person's life while the person is hooked into a machine in the comfort of their own home and interact with the world through their surrogate. Why is this cool idea forced upon us in the plot structure of a police procedural/murder mystery, with evil corporate machinations/anti-technology groups trying to sabotage the surrogacy program and Bruce Willis running around jumping, kicking butt Die-Hard style with car chases, helicopter crashes, explosions/action sequences ripped righ out of Terminator 3 which itself was ripped out of Terminator 2 which was ripped out of The Terminator.     In case that diatribe made no sense, I was saying there is nothing original in this movie and it's a rehash of earlier ideas and stories as well as all the trappings of your typical big-budget commercial spectacle. It's really terrible to see the director, a once promising Jonathan Mostow, actually rip off action scenes from his own movies, films still fresh in the mind. Radha Mitchell's character in this movie is jumping on cars like the TX in Terminator 3 and so is Bruce Willis.    I suppose this is enjoyable dreck on some level and there is plenty of humor involved when it comes to what a world like this would be like. Consumer commodity madness at it's worst. But it's been done to death in far more ambitious and intellectual films such as Blade Runner. Someone mentioned the similarities between Surrogates and I-Robot. I agree, both films are dumb sci-fi and that's all we can expect.
B001TODCII|4.0|The Bottom Line:    No one is going to accuse Taken of being an intelligent film, but if you're in the mood for a slick action movie that moves relentlessly from one scene to the next, doesn't use CGI, and never requires brain usage, than Taken is the film for you.    3/4
B000003CMB|5.0|By 1971, the live/extended improvisational rock album was nothing new, but it hadn't yet been crystallized with the beauty of Southern rock and roll. Sure, bands like Cream had dug into the trunks of blues for their work, but five-sixths of the Allman Brothers Band were actually natives of the dirty South, and could therefore express those roots better than their English counterparts.<br />But unlike their British rock and roll colleagues, the Allman Brothers Band breathed new life into what would have normally been called drawn-out noodling. But staleness was not the case with the fire and passion instilled by the still-unmatched pairing of guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, the keyboards and tormented vocals of Gregg Allman, Berry Oakley's muddy genuine bass, and the double-percussion of Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny Johanson.<br />When it was released, \\"At Fillmore East\\" was a double album, yet still did not contain all of the incredible performances from March 12/13, 1971 (the group supposedly jammed until dawn, which isn't too far-fetched when one considers the wealth of unreleased Fillmore material dished out on recent expanded editions, and on the band's 1972 album \\"Eat a Peach\\").<br />Through the blistering extended jams, one never loses interest, and there are no \\"live album cliches\\" to weigh down the music. Dickey Betts' stirring instrumental \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" is a must, the opening \\"Statesboro Blues,\\" as well as the Elmore James tune \\"Done Somebody Wrong,\\" are educational for the blues beginner.<br />\\"You Don't Love Me\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\" both clock in at nearly or over twenty minutes, but are never tiresome, the latter being both beautiful, rousing, and haunting all at the same time, without a doubt one of Duane Allman's finest moments on record.<br />On a side note, the album also showcases how the Allmans were one of the few rock bands who could make having two drummers useful, as the sounds of Trucks and Johanson compliment and feed off one another (Modest Mouse also recently made the two drummers concept listenable).<br />To quote an old reviewer cliche, \\"If you don't already own this album, buy it now.\\" It's a testament to arguably the greatest point in the Allman's early career, and the evidence that Duane Allman was probably the greatest guitarist of the 20th Century, a musical gift that could only come from God. Don't miss this one.(Modest Mouse also recently made the two drummers concept listenable).

B002BSHXJA|1.0|I have not listened to them all but here is what I heard on Revolver and Pepper.<br /><br />First, my audio system is a good one, including an expensive outboard DAC and some very exacting speakers.<br /><br />Both discs sounded heavy, uninvolving and dead.  After all the acclaim on these and other boards for the Mono Box this was a huge disappointment to me.  I started to think that I had suffered some kind of hearing insult.<br /><br />But when I switched to the stereo remasters, wow, what a difference.  Open, crisp, airy.  I know all about the unbalanced mixes that afflict most of the discs, but there's just no comparison.  Buy the stereo box.<br /><br />P.S.  Five-star music, no doubt about it.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|When I looked at the review numbers, I was surprised at how evenly they're spaced between 1-5 stars.  Chris Cornell is one of the best voices out there and could sing the phone book and I'd listen.  I am not, however, a big fan of this sound.  I love that Cornell is not afraid to do something different and maybe even just have fun making an album.  I do hope that his next album is more like his former albums so that I can enjoy his voice and edgy style again.  I'm afraid this won't be an album I'll be listening to, but am still a loyal fan who is willing to wait patiently for Cornell's next project and keep listening to his former work in the meantime.

0316069906|5.0|I appreciate the honest look at the meat production industry presented in this book. Most of all I like the style with which Foer communicates his findings.  The author reveals a lot of personal information but he also asks the readers to live by their own standards, not his.  All that makes it for an easy and even enjoyable reading of a lifestyle book which nonetheless reads like a novel.        Eating Animals is a very inspiring and informative book.  I wholeheartedly encourage everybody to consider reading it.  Even -- or maybe, especially if -- you are not a vegetarian. It definitely changed the way I view the world.  It might do the same to you.  And if not, you will at least enjoy reading a book that not only educates but also entertains.  And one more thing that I can promise each and every reader -- THIS BOOK WILL REALLY MAKE YOU THINK AND FORCE YOU TO MAKE PROFOUND CHOICES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE WAY YOU LIVE THE REMAINING PART OF YOUR LIFE.      I noticed that some reviewers mention \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" as a companion to this book.  In my opinion it would be reading the same just by another author.  To get a broader view at nutrition and how it affects our health, our longevity, and the world around us I suggest reading \\"Can we Lve 150 Years\\" instead.
0307454541|4.0|[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]]<br /><br />Stieg Larsson was a political journalist and graphics specialist for 20 years at a Swedish news agency. He also actively belonged to an organization called Expo, dedicated to fighting fascism and racism in Sweden and Europe. It's said that he and his partner Eva Gabrielsson lived under constant threat from right-wing/neo-fascist violence. Larsson died of a heart-attack in 2004, a few months before the Swedish release of the first of three novels dedicated to the unusual character Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo<br />by Stieg Larsson<br />Viking Canada, 2008<br />ISBN: 978-0-670-06901-9<br />465 pages<br />Hardcover<br />Crime/Mystery<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a 24-year-old bisexual, super-intelligent, violent, social and moral deviant who is a ward of the court. She also happens to be one of the top three computer hackers in Sweden. It's through this capacity, employed by an investigative and research company, that Lisbeth meets Mikael \\"Kalle\\" Blomkvist, a recently disgraced investigative reporter (in the financial industry) who's involved in two very interesting projects.<br /><br />Blomkvist is seeking revenge on an industrialist named Wennerstr&ouml;m, and, in exchange for much needed dirt on the man, he has also agreed to investigate the disappearance of one Harriet Vanger forty years ago.<br /><br />Vanger vanished from a secluded island compound owned by her powerful family. A body was never found, there are no witnesses and no evidence of a crime exists: the problem appears to be identical to the \\"locked-room murder mystery\\" that crime-fiction buffs love. And the only thing Harriet's uncle, Henrik Vanger, will say with any conviction is that he fears she was murdered by someone in his own family.<br /><br />Together, Blomkvist and Salander sift through the history of an extremely dysfunctional family until they stumble upon something so terrible it could destroy everyone involved.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo reads like two stories in one: the struggle of Kalle Blomkvist to put his shattered life back together, and the character study of Lisbeth Salander. Both of these stories are hung on the mystery represented by Harriet Vanger. Yet, none of this is true, and the author spells it out quite clearly...<br /><br />Stieg Larsson was adamantly opposed to violence against women. This is what the book is about. The novel is full of such violence and explores, quite controversially, the role of the victim. Second, each part of the book begins with a statistic regarding violence against women in Sweden. Third, the original title of the book was Men Who Hate Women. Fourth, and this is my own opinion, Larsson also uses the book to highlight the casual regard many Europeans have for sex. He doesn't make a noticeable statement about this; one must question each sexual encounter in the book to arrive at the conclusion that the author is trying to point something out. What that something might be, I'll leave for you to decide.<br /><br />I just hope you don't think, like one critic of the book, that the sex scenes are gratuitous. Nothing in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is gratuitous: this is well-written fiction with very strong messages. I suspect some rather abrupt transitions and questionable grammatical choices are the fault of the translator, not the author.

Victor Wooten is one of my favorite musicians and I'm so happy that he wrote this book that shared his insight on how music and life are intertwined, explaining some of the secrets of the universe and allowing the reader to enter into the musical world.     It's a must-read for everyone ...musicians, non-musicians, music-listeners, etc.

B000FBGBPC|2.0|Not a real bad CD, not a real great CD, It has one or two songs that really stand out, and then the rest sound like your typical K-bear played melencholy hard rock songs. the song \\"This Animal I have Become\\" is great with a simple but interesting bass line to start the beginning of the cd, a little bit quick, moves around, making it fun to listen to, and there are some simple changes that catch the ear, but the rest the cd really doesn't grab my attention, just by the sound alone I couldn't sit through this cd in one sitting, That would be near torture, for me. Either way I tend to you tube songs before i purchase a CD if i question wether I'll like it or not. be a good thing to do before you purchase it. Yep, get the track listing, you tube the songs, listen to the whole thing decide.   P.S. I usually don't pick out singles, but often I find that I like another song a lot more on the CD that most people won't even be aware of, the case was not so this time.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first season of Legend of the Seeker.<br /><br />4/5 stars in acting.<br />4/5 stars in the chemistry between the \\"forbidden love\\" for the two main characters.<br /><br />I really like the woman that plays Kahla.<br /><br />I think that there should have been more battle training sessions when it came to the sword fighting.<br /><br />It sort of reminds me of the \\"Blue Harvest\\" where Luke/Chris says \\"you don't believe in the force do you?\\"  - \\"you mean that thing that you just learned about 20 minutes ago\\"<br /><br />I was looking forward to the love / hate relationship I thought I would have with this show ... (love to hate it but still watch it) due to the cheesiness and bad acting I thought it would have but, I am quite impressed.
B001F7EZ9Y|2.0|You will find no bigger AC/DC fan than me.  I own all of their stuff.  I'm writing this because I'm frankly a little shocked that this album is getting so much undeserved hype.  The only, and I mean only, song that is remotely decent is Rock N Roll Train.  Frankly, you have to go way back to The Razor's Edge for AC/DC's last solid album.  It's been all downhill after that, but Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip at least had more than one good song, and I would rank the song \\"Hard as a Rock\\" off Ballbreaker among the band's best songs.  But Black Ice is just filled with duds.  Their lyrics have never been that great since Bon Scott died, but they could certainly get by with the power and the amazing catchy riffs of their music.  Well, not with this album.  I was hugely disappointed, it's the only album I own of theirs that I almost universally do not like.  I'm really kind of surprised AC/DC fans like this album.    Again, to each his own, it's all subjective, but I just want to throw my opinion in the mix that this album is very, very weak.  I'd give it 1 star but I'm too much of a fan of the band to do that.

This man is a masterful presenter who knows how to lead his audience from dissatisfaction or satisfaction to genuine excitement. The analysis provided by the author captures the essence and specifics of Job's speaking brilliance.
B002S0OBFK|1.0|Obviously most everybody knows that this movie has loads of hype behind it.  The commercials praised the fear-instilling nature of the film showing an audience jumping in fright.  Does it live up to the claims?  I went to the movie with my wife and we both expected it to be a flop.  Afterall, when there's loads of hype behind something it often times means it's going to be a joke.  Well, it wasn' a COMPLETE flop, but it wasn't scary at all.  My wife is a veteran horror fan and I'm a newbie horror fan.  Neither of us were scared once from this movie.  The sad part is that the only interesting part about the movie is the interactions between the two main characters which make for an interesting lesson in relationships.    The main characters are a boyfriend/girlfriend couple living together in the guy's house.  The film is completely viewed through the new camera the boyfriend purchased to hopefully catch footage of the alleged demon haunting his girlfriend.  It starts off extremely slow with some simple everyday activities of the couple, then they have a psychic come to their home to ask his advice.  The few \\"scary\\" scenes mostly occur while they are asleep in their room with the camera still rolling.  Unfortunately, nothing scary ever happens.  There's some weird stuff, but that's about it.  The only reason I didn't feel like I wasted my money was because 1) I didn't expect much of the movie in the first place, and 2) my curiosity was satisfied.    The audience we were sitting with clearly didn't think it was particularly scary either (apart from two girls who freaked out over EVERYTHING).  People were laughing rather than screaming, and nobody jumped like the commercials advertized.  The only part that really makes things interesting is the VERY END which still didn't do that much for me.  So, even if you don't go in with high expectations you MAY still be disappointed!  However, if you know you will like this kind of movie, go ahead and give it a shot.  Just because I didn't get anything out of it doesn't mean you won't.    EDIT: I modified the ending of my review to make it more reasonable.  Thanks for everybody who has read it so far (even if they did vote down my review, lol).
0316017922|4.0|Written with fascinating anecdotes, the author attempts to uncover why some people achieve extraordinary success.  Gladwell is a masterful story teller and within a few pages, you feel like you are in a one-on-one conversation with the author.  But what is success?  Is it winning 51% of the time?  Is it achieving your goals?  Is it being the best in your field of endeavor?  These are questions you will find yourself thinking about as you rummage through the pages.  Although I didn't receive any practical tools to increase my chances for success, I do support his idea that success is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity.  ie. 10,000 hours of preparation coupled with the right opportunity at the right time, will create extraordinary success.  But, what if the person has a subconscious self-sabotaging dynamic?  Will that person become an Outlier?  Read this remarkable book to determine your own answers.    With this said, I recommend [[ASIN:0471414646 Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self]] to discover the difference between mediocre, extraordinary and optimal thinking and how to use optimal thinking to obtain the best results.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|I really loved this movie, I am a big horror movie fan....I especially like the older scary movies, I just wish they had better effects. The newer scary movies actually tick me off at times, like the remake of Friday the 13th....I wont go there.....but that being said I found myself so riled up over this little girl and felt so bad about myself since i was thinking  \\" why dont someone knock the hell out of that little girl\\" but all at the same time frustrated because I shouldn't feel that way about a child obviously ( I have three boys I am not an abusive parent) but once I got closer to the end of the movie I felt so much better about hating the little creature. OF course I won't explain any of the movie because I dont like spoiling endings for anyone who hasn't watched the movie. So anyone who likes their mind messed with, rent this, it is definitly a buyer!!

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Nice mix of modern and classic prog in the songs that make up the 1st disc.  Some harmonies that will bring on a sense of frisson.  Also, some really dark metal sections that ultimately resolve into beauty.  The subject matter seems disturbing, but this has been the case since In Absentia.<br /><br />The second disc has a few unrelated songs, but again they are 1st class.  Remember Me Lover is the best of these.<br /><br />The only minor disappointment is the relative repetitiveness of Gavin Harrison's drum parts, but only as compared to prior releases.  In comparison to 99% of the rock music released today, it is pure genius.<br /><br />Buy now.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|First, I have a fond spot in my heart for Abba and their music. What a great script, a great score, fun actors all around... but Meryl Streep ruins this film for me.  Her performance is wayyyy over the top.  She's trying to play 15 years younger and it just doesn't work.  Absolutely horrible performance.  She should have won the Razzy for worst performance of the year!  The ABC show Modern Family had a wonderful joke about her performance in a recent episode, basically, the gay character loved her and the straight one didn't. I feel that this joke epitomizes my feeling about her in this role.  If you love all musicals, then you'll probably like this one.  If you actually care about acting and craft you'll probably agree with me that Streep's performance is unwatchable.      5 Stars to script, songs, supporting cast, location.  Negative 4 Stars to Meryl Streep for a completely unwatchable performance. Equals one star.    I just wish MST3K was still around to lampoon this film.  This one will go right up there with Gigli, From Justin to Kelly, and Showgirls as one of the worst films EVER!!!

B00005KB9T|5.0|CATCH A FIRE is the second mainstream album release for The Wailers. Contrary to popular belief, their first album released outside of Jamaica was SOUL REBEL in 1970.  This, however, would be the album were Reggae truly arrived & the masses took notice. This was the album that inspired singers/songwriters around the world, both known and unknown, to learn how to write & perform Roots & Ska Reggae.  The bands primary members, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh & Bunny Wailer, along with Aston Barrett, Carlton Barrett & John Bundrick,  were about to embark on a truly historic run that would bring the poetic, revolutionary & spiritual nature of Reggae to an audience that had never heard anything quite like that before.<br /><br />Although the entire band worked wonderfully together as a cohesive unit, this was very much an album that was dominated by the musical genius of Bob Marley who wrote every song with the exception of 2 which were written by Peter Tosh. However, one of those songs by Tosh, \\"400 years\\", is one of my personal favorites on the album. Take a listen to that one and reflect as it's pure lyrical & musical mastery! Overall one of the most important albums in music history as it was the beginnging of one of the most influential periods of the 20th century.<br /><br />CATCH A FIRE was the culmination of years of hard work were The Wailers took an island genre, honed it's sound & message, into a reflection of the injustices and hardships they were experiencing in Jamaica & other island nations & made it mainstream. Reggae as a particular genre of music now generates billions of dollars worldwide and The Wailers are one of the primary reasons why.  I think one of the most underappreciated things about this band is it's musicianship.<br /><br />The albums first track, \\"Concrete Jungle\\" has a gorgeous introduction with an almost blues rock feel to it and the guitar solo is spectacular.  The variety on the album is wonderful, from the hard driving songs of opression like this song, \\"Slave Driver\\" and the aforementioned \\"400 years\\" to a song of courtship and desire like \\"Baby We've Got A Date\\" that has almost a Country music feel with the slide guitar.  This was a time of great revolution for around the world for oppressed peoples to be able to live, love, worship and express how they felt according to their own conscious.  The island nations were fighting for freedom from their european oppressors as were many of the African nations with whom The Wailers shared a kindred spirit with and their songs were the songs of freedom, in all aspects of life, for many of those nations and became a ralling cry as well.<br /><br />These were the times of movements such as \\"Black Power\\" & \\"Civil Rights\\" here in the U.S. and many historical artists and bands were picking up their pens and writing songs of revolution. The sheer poetry of groups like The Impressions, Earth, Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone and artists like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and James Brown, were singing about those of African heritage rising up and solidifying their power and spear heading a revolution of sorts here too.<br /><br />It's interesting that The Wailers patterned their group after The Impressions with a rich poetic vibe along with a gospel or Spiritual message just under the surface. This is a clear portrait of what made this band great and historic. The Wailers who were truly about to shake the very foundations of the world in a very short period of time had, by this time, developed a tight sound to go with their lyrical content.<br /><br />The Wailers were blessed with three very talented and deeply spiritual songwriters in Marley, Tosh and Neville O'Riley Livingston aka Bunny Wailer. The music they made as a part of this band and the music produced after their break up are some of the most beloved at any point in music history. This was truly a special time as the world was changing at a rapid pace and no one had ever heard of this type of music, coming from this point of view before at least not on a \\"mainstream\\" level.<br /><br />This is why today The Wailers and especially Bob Marley are so very beloved and admired by countless millions around the world. Their songs were songs of revolution and not just in a physical since but also mental and spiritual as well. Their will never be another band like them and those of us who were blessed to witness their greatness while together have never and will never be the same.g from this point of view before at least not on a \\"mainstream\\" level.<br /><br />This is why today The Wailers and especially Bob Marley are so very beloved and admired by countless millions around the world.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|..... it was THAT good.<br /><br />What an amazing talent. How awesomely alive and full of charisma.<br /><br />And fortunately, not too many crotch-grabs during the documentary. That was one thing about MJ that I never cared for.<br /><br />But even with that, he was an extraordinary human and his absence from the world is tragic.
B00000JFV9|5.0|SUPERFLY: Amy Linden's editoral review was spot on about the sometime over use of the term \\"Classic\\" & she was also spot on when stating that that doesn't apply here. This is, without question, one of the most incredible albums ever to be released & truly solidified Curtis Mayfield's true genius.  This album broke so much ground that it's truly scary that it's concepts were all the workings of one individual.  This was the soundtrack to a film and holds the distinction of being one of the precious few sountracks to out gross the film it scored.<br /><br />The album as reached number 1 on both the R&B & Pop charts, and set such a standard for how soundtracks were to be recorded from that point on.  It was truly an artist displaying full mastery of his craft, composing, writing, arranging, producing, singing and performing, Curtis did it all!  He had already had a Hall Of Fame career as a member of The Impressions who are one of the most under-appreciated groups of all time!  He also has released 3 solo albums previous to this one being \\"Curtis\\"; \\"Roots\\" and \\"Curtis Live\\" that had established him as an undenible force of nature.  But this was to be his signature album, you know, the one that from then on we would point back to when giving an example of his absolute greatness.<br /><br />All the greats have \\"that\\" album were everything truly comes together and there's no denying it's flawless genius.  He was an influence to millions across the world by the time this album and movie were released.  The true genius here is that the movie is based upon the life of a \\"Pusherman\\" and, in many ways, glorifies that lifestyle.  Curtis took the script and turned it on it's head in such a brilliant and almost subtle way that it's almost missed.<br /><br />\\"Little Child Running Wild\\" is a perfect example of this, while the film is busy glorifying it's ghetto prince, Curtis is portrays the terrilbe nature of his condition and how it came to be that way.  \\"Pusherman\\" is ghetto perfection and more than any other song, gives an expose of life on the streets in the \\"hood.\\"  It is a perfect fit for the scene in the movie where it appears and is one of the absolute highlights.  It would almost seem as if Curtis is glorifying here but if you listen, it's almost a mockery of the lifestyle and those trapped within it.<br /><br />The next song is \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and more than any other displays the genius of this man.  Freddie's character has exactly 10 to 15 seconds, if that, at the beginning of the film and as Curtis sings, he's murdered and thrown on a corner to die.  From that small scene, Mr. Mayfield gives us the longest track on the album and tells such a gripping tale with such gorgeous compositions that you truly feel as if you've know the man all of his life.  And that's the most profound beauty of this soundtrack, Curtis is telling another story within the story being revealed on screen.  You truly would miss his lyrical content within the context of the overall film if it wasn't there.  Like there's several scenes missing.<br /><br />There are 2 wonderful instrumental pieces \\"Junkie Chase\\" and \\"Think\\" both of which shows off Mayfield's tremendous music composition skills which, to these ears, are second to none.  \\"Give Me Your Love\\" is as sensual as song as you'll ever hear and is as hot and steamy as the love scene it played behind in the film.  Another crown jewel on the album is \\"Eddie You Should Know Better\\", this song is, in a way, the exact opposite of \\"Freddie's Dead\\" in that Eddie is a main character and truly another sad soul who instead of giving you background information on, Curtis takes the least amount of time to deal with as he is a truly pitiful individual and the song just laments the state he's ended up in after so many people worked so hard to help him be better.<br /><br />\\"No Thing On Me (Cocaine Song)is Curtis giving soulful wisdom, it's the most telling denunciation of the \\"ghetto lifestyle\\" on the album and is as poetic a song as you'll hear.  And the title and closing track, \\"Superfly\\", is another song, which if you give a close listen, not only doesn't praise the lifestyle but is almost a tongue lashing as the smarts displayed on the streets could be used for something far more benefical to himself and the community at large.<br /><br />I have stated on several occasions that Mr. Mayfield was the single most under-apprecicated artist of all time.  His lyrics, music compositions & vocals and the combination of the 3 were as impressive as anyone in music history & i'd put his albums up against any artist & The Impressions albums up against any groups in any genre from any time period.  This truly was his time to shine and shine he did, this album was a game changer and music was the beneficary of it's wonderful themes and techniques.oetic a song as you'll hear.

B00006I53S|5.0|If you can't afford to buy L glass, this is the way to go.  I debated for a long time between this one and 24-105L and finally decided to get the 28-135 instead.  Mounted on my 40D, I get results that are very close to my prime lenses.  Not as sharp, but close.  I've yet to have problems with autofocus, even in dark room and the USM autofocus is great.  The only downfall of this lens is the construction - the lens is a bit wobbly and the zoom creep is present if you point the lens down.
386521584X|5.0|Robert Frank's pictures of America in the 1950s are comparable in depth and perceptiveness to Dorothea Lange's pictures of the 1930s.  They are in black and white and call you back to look at them again and again.  Composition is excellent.  I had not heard of Robert Frank until recently.   His photographic work, however, is excellent.
B00008YJH5|5.0|I was introduced to the Pixies via my love for Nirvana - I read a number of interviews in which Kurt Cobain praised them, and the fact that he sited \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as him trying to recreate a Pixies song was reason enough for me to check them out. After listening to the musical experience that is \\"Surfer Rosa\\", I am very glad I did. Now, keep in mind, there is a reason that the Pixies are strictly an underground phenomenon - their very unique combination of melody, bizarre lyrics and abrasive, guitar-driven sound is not something that will appeal to the mass majority of people. However, if you are able to get past how \\"weird\\" the Pixies are, their genius becomes apparent.     They seem to have a knack for bringing hooks into their songs seemingly out of nowhere - \\"Broken Face\\" starts out with a high pitched squeal of the line \\"I've got a broken FACE\\", but then, in a matter of seconds, the chorus hits and the song becomes irresistable. The fact that the Pixies could leap from the abstract and bizarre (the previously mentioned track, \\"Tony's Theme\\", \\"River Euphrates\\") to brief excursions of pop-infused bliss (\\"Gigantic\\", \\"Where is my Mind?\\") serves as a testament to the undeniable talent of these 4 individuals. There is no doubt that the Pixies are a hugely influential band, but that is not the reason why this album is held in such high esteem. The fact is this album, from beginning to end, is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it to anybody who considers themselves the least bit interested in the whole \\"Indie\\" scene.
0061339202|4.0|The title is a bit misleading, as flow does not describe \\"optimal experience\\", but simply genuine experience where the subject is just one with the experience. It is true that this is also some kind of \\"optimal way\\" to experience life, but by no means can one so easily optimize it. So now, the book won't help you get into those kind of experiences. However, it gives some insight into how simple it is to get into that, when you really love what you do and forget about everybody else when you do it.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|When my daughter asked me to watch this movie with her I didn't cringe; I just smiled and said \\"Okay honey.\\" Sometimes this get's me into a lot of trouble and I end up watching thee most boring cartoon of my life while she laughs her little head off. (Sometimes I imagine she's laughing at conning me into watching these snore fests, but nine year olds aren't that devious, right?) At any rate just like the first two movies Ice Age Dawn of the Dino's didn't disappoint. I laughed out loud and frequently. You won't regret this and I imagine I'll be watching again and again which is fine by me.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I bought this album, unheard, after reading reviews in the New Yorker and on Amazon--not the best way to pick new music.  But I'm glad I did.  Grizzly Bear doesn't sound like any other band I've heard.  Though there are occasional faint reminders of other groups, they have their own sound, and it's mellow and complex. I've played this album at least a dozen times, and it still sounds great to me--familiarity hasn't decreased the pleasure.  I'd definitely buy more of their music.

B0025KVLUG|3.0|It is stretching things a little bit to describe this as a Beatles album, since half of the album is taken up with George Martin's orchestral score for the movie. Many of these tunes are pleasant enough, and it's certainly of interest to Martin fans, but the reality is they are not Beatles songs.     So only half of the album (six songs) are Beatles' efforts. And only four of them are new. And only two of those are worth shelling out for. Are two songs worth the cost of a whole album?    Die-hard fans will no doubt answer \\"yes\\", but I'm not sure what they'll make of this. 'Yellow Submarine' and 'All You Need is Love' are Beatle classics and certainly worthy of another listen, but the fact is that these are not new songs. Of the four songs that actually are new, 'All Together Now' is a throwaway, and the self-consciously ironic 'Only A Northern Song' is not much more. In contrast, 'Hey Bulldog' is a great song; with a catchy stomping riff, a good performance from Lennon on vocals, and a singalong chorus. And Harrison's epic 'It's All Too Much' is clearly the best of the lot; like many Harrison-penned Beatle songs of the late 60's, it seems to point the way forward to 'All Things Must Pass'.     So two outstanding songs from the mid 60's, a couple of good new songs, some filler, and half an album's worth of orchestral noodling. Even allowing for the old \\"Beatle throwaways are better than most band's best music\\" theory, this is a very underwhleming release, and not really a proper Beatles album at all. It's definitely not the place to start for casual fans. Recommended for the ultra-dedicated Beatle fan only, and even then solely for completeness' sake.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Still reeling. Goosebumps. Bought the CD and Program at WalMart today for only $10 each. Will be seeing this movie several more times in the theater. Big screen is as close as you are EVER going to get to MJ. Brilliant. To the death, he defied gravity and delivered creativity, passion, excitement, better dancing than I've seen him do in his whole career, camaraderie and collaboration with his team, patience, kindness, musical brilliance and, in the end, LOVE.  This would have been the biggest spectacle/concert ever mounted. I cherish  his memory and I can't wait to have this DVD in my permanent collection.  Ten stars. Phenomenal. RIP MJ.

0380973839|3.0|Well, first off, I wish that I had known before I started that this was actually going to be a series of short stories with very little link between them all. I might have saved myself the trouble of reading it, since in the end, I really didn't enjoy it.<br />I'll admit that it was very well written and imaginative, nothing short of what one would expect from Ray Bradbury. The Mars of the future that he creates is one that is easy to believe in (or would be if we didn't already know it wasn't like that), and the changes it goes through over time are almost what is to be expected, sometimes a daring leap away from the expected.<br />So it wasn't bad. It was just boring. Most of the time. The occasional story that was an exciting, thought provoking, and adventuresome escape from reaility. For eight whole pages, it was easy to forget that I am living today, in 2010, in a world in which Mars is uninhabited by human or other. I would get so into that Mars, not wanting it to end. . .<br />And then the next story would start, and I would have to force myself to read, to not fall asleep, for a good 70 or 80 pages until the next 8 pages of joy would sneak up on me.<br />The prose was lyrical and beautiful, and Ray Bradbury's ideas are fresh and different (especially, I imagine, back in the 1940's when it was written). It's really just such a pity that it had to go off and be boring. Because it could have been great. It had potential.<br /><br />I'd love to give the titles of the short stories I particularly enjoyed, but I read the book in French.  I'll translate, but I don't know if they'll translate the same way.<br />-The Summer of the Spaceship (L'ete de la fusee)<br />-The Men from Earth (Les hommes de la Terre)<br />-Balls of Fire (Les Ballons de Feu)<br />-Usher House (Usher II)<br />-High Up in the Sky (Tout La-Haut dans le ciel)<br />-Picnic in A Million Years (Picque-Nicque dans un million d'annees)
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is it is more than a movie.  It's an insight into the real Michael Jackson.  Someone who was driven by circumstances that most of us will never experience.  I enjoyed every second of it.
B002S0OBFK|2.0|From all the great reviews this movie's received (especially from critics), I was expecting to at least like it if not love it. I must say I was very disappointed in what I saw.<br /><br />Here's a quick rundown:<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />- The actors did a good job.<br />- There was a good funny scene, which was the only thing I remembered when I left the theater.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />- This movie wasn't scary at all. If you're one of those people who closes their eyes and covers their ears when watching horror movies, you might find this one scary...because you won't be able to see/hear that it's not!<br />- The movie was mostly boring. There was a little suspense, but not enough to make me care. I just wanted it to be over or for something interesting to happen. At least my first wish was granted. :)<br />- The ending. Could have been a lot better.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't waste your money on this one. If you must see it, wait for the DVD and rent it.<br /><br />Also: Blair Witch Project was better.
159448385X|4.0|An amazing story of heart ache and endurance, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini is a beautiful book about  two women trying to survive in war  torn Afghanistan.  Once you begin, this book will be impossible to put down until the very last word.  As the story switches between two heroic, empowered, and hopeful characters and the characters lives become unexpectedly intertwined, the reader is pulled into a suffering Afghanistan, given a broader sense of the world, and made to feel  helplessly connected to the anguish that these women are somehow able to tolerate.    This book is beautifully written and has wonderful themes of love, survival, and humanity that come full circle in the end of the book.  With each passing  page, the reader becomes entwined  in the lives of these women and starts hoping for their futures.  This story also has plot twists that will shock you and make you  keep reading, no matter  how  late at night it is.   Each page as tantalizing as the next, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khalad Hosseini is a stunningly touching book  that thrills, moves, and inspires the reader as well as provides a worldly view of an entirely different culture then our own. I  highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story and  amazing characters.
0810983915|5.0|In the book,\\"  Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book4 Dog Days\\" I had many good thoughts!  I thought the big idea in this book, also in every book, was to just be your self!  My evidence for that is that when Greg went to the pool, He was trying to act \\"sweet\\" and \\"cool\\" around Heather Hills. He did that so The really cool kids would \\"hang with him\\"!  You probably should'nt do that 'cause if you act your self around other peopele they will respect you for youself, not someone your not!  This book is a levle 50.  I would totally recamend this book to anyone who is a levle 50, or anyone who likes to read diary books.  Also, before you read this book, you should read the other \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books!        Samantha
B001TKADSY|3.0|*Caution* if you can't handle a tremendously sad story, do not go anywhere near this book!  Although \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini is a beautifully written and inspiring tale, you will sob throughout the book and will be left in a somber mood after each chapter is finished. This book tells the story of two women in Afghanistan trying to overcome the sorrows of war, loss, and an abusive husband.  This book is full of heroic characters, hope, and love, and is overall a wonderful story.  But, despite this, the book had a few hard  to ignore flaws.  The author used many Farsi and Pashto words meant  to enhance the story, but ended up confusing the reader as  there was no reference source to translate words and  phrases.  In addition to this, the book has a confusing tense change at the end that makes the last fifty pages or so awkward and  hard to read.  Finally, my last complaint is that the author occasionally directly tells the reader when a theme from earlier in the book comes back into play.  This can leave the reader with a feeling of  being spoken down  too.  Although \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini did  have  a few \\"not up to par\\" parts, I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good  read that will move you every time you open the covers.
044654146X|5.0|Yet again the Israelites are leading the way. This is amazing how a small country surrounded by enemies and cut off from several major ports of commerce is able to do so much. This is a great lesson for the US and anyone who runs or wants to start a business. My favorite part is how they don't dismiss military experience like so many recruiters in the US do.    This should be required reading in business schools
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|In an attempt to explain what makes this album worth purchasing, I will break it down to 5 simple words: \\"It's all about the Sound.\\" While it is true that the first CD of this album is a compilation of MJ's greatest hits, it needs to be pointed out that the majority of these songs have been remastered. In order to discern the difference, I took the original and remastered versions of these songs, and played them side-by-side on the same audio equipment with exactly the same settings. The difference is clear and easy to detect. As good as the originals are, once you hear the remastered versions, the originals sound flat and dull. The remastered versions are crisper, deeper, and fuller. It is simply wonderful to be able to hear how much more amazing these classic songs can sound. I have heard these songs hundreds of times over the years, and yet, after listening to these remastered versions, I felt like I was really hearing them for the first time. To all those who love MJ's music, please don't discount this album simply because these songs have been available for years in their earlier versions. These new versions are absolutely fantastic!     As for the demos on the 2nd CD, they are absolute treasures. Hearing the early versions of these songs takes you inside MJ's creative process, which is a rare and special treat. While the song, \\"This Is It\\" isn't a towering achievement like \\"Thriller,\\" it is a lovely song with a catchy tune that will stick in your head.     Regarding the spoken poem, \\"Planet Earth,\\" MJ released a book back in 1992 called, \\"Dancing The Dream.\\" This book was a compilation of poetry and short essays that MJ wrote. The poem \\"Planet Earth\\" is one of the poems from this book. Despite the fact that I had read the poem many times, hearing MJ himself actually reading the poem was both beautiful and heart-wrenching. MJ was a visionary, and this is readily apparent when you hear the emotion and depth in his voice as he reads his love poem to the Earth. Doyourself a favor--buy this album, and treat yourself to the wonderful, creative genius of the greatest entertainer who ever lived, Michael Jackson--the King of Pop.
B000002LCU|5.0|Being a big fan, all I can say it that this is one of his better albums.  It should be part of everyone's Beatles collection.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! This was a fantastic book and I am hard to please. A great story that can be described as a cross between Apocalypse Now and The Running Man (Movie). My only complaint is that the sequel is not available for my Kindle.
B002Q4U9YU|2.0|I have to tell you folks: This whole Michael Jackson death thing is getting to be the stuff of parody.  As if the release of bloopers as a \\"major motion picture\\" wasn't bad enough, but this album release from Sony is so much more offensive on so many levels.  Now I don't want to berate Sony too much because there WAS a movie titled \\"This Is It\\" released in theaters which meant a soundtrack album was to shortly follow.  And from the outside it appears that this was a project of great love and care.  The album comes in a digibook that can hold the two CD's comfortably inside.<br /><br />When you open it up you are treated to a beautiful 40 plus page glossy booklet with pictures and information on the concert that would have likely been the pinnacle of MJ's career.  This is a lovely package when you look at it, and it looks very nice on any album collectors shelf.  Pop in the CD though and the ugly truth rears it's ugly head: These are nothing but repackaged songs.  Ignorantly I assumed they'd use the concert recordings found in the picture, but rather then master those for CD they decided to take songs that have been reissued to death and sell them to loyal fans once again.<br /><br />Well, except for \\"They Don't Care About Us.\\"  To my knowledge that's only on the \\"HIStory\\" album.  Now the thing is these songs are classic songs.  They are still great.  They sound great.  But...they sound great on all the other albums too.  These are not the best these songs have ever sounded and real MJ fans have multiple copies of these songs.  I know that MJ's death inspired a spike in sales for his albums and the record companies would be fools to not take advantage of that.  But this year alone we got at LEAST four new compilation albums from Sony!  Plus with \\"HIStory,\\" \\"Number Ones,\\" \\"The Essential Michael Jackson,\\" and many more, did we really need this to be a similar repackaging of old material?<br /><br />Now to be fair there is SOME new material!  An unreleased song titled \\"This Is It\\" gets two versions on this release: A studio recording and an orchestra recording.  Both versions sound great, but this is far from his best unreleased song.  Then we have a second disk with three demo tracks and a poem MJ wrote (and reads for this release) called \\"Planet Earth.\\"  The poem is certainly interesting and nice to have, but most demos aren't worth the time to listen to them and neither are these.  Why would one bother to listen to the clunky demo recordings when they can listen to the cleaned up and professional studio recordings?  Besides, is any of this worth having a second disk anyway?<br /><br />This release would not have been a problem if the concert recordings were what was on this disk.  At least it would be slightly different then what we've already bought multiple times, but the last thing I feel I needed was another greatest hits compilation from MJ.  Is this going to be the norm from now?  Release a new compilation collection with one unreleased song every time?  I hope to God this isn't the case.  MJ's music is great but if have all his music this is a tough recommendation.  And if you've never bought an MJ CD before then buying \\"The Essential\\" collection would make for a better investment then this.  Because aside from the gloss packaging there's almost nothing we haven't already heard before.<br /><br />Grade: ** stars (the second star is there because, regardless of my feelings of the release, this is STILL classic music)sions on this release: A studio recording and an orchestra recording.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|I ordered this series long before the movie came out. I really enjoyed it and was quite excited when I heard the story was being made into a film starring one of my absolute favs, Helen Mirren. This BBC series is MUCH better than the film. The relationships are explored more fully and I found the ending of the series much more satisfying. If you saw the film and liked it, I think you will prefer this series version.
0385495323|5.0|This is an incredible book that walks the reader through the history of Cryptography in a form that is very easy and enjoyable to read.

This book has motivated me to continue my study of Cryptography.
B001AIRUP4|4.0|In a time long forgotten, various towns were responsible for giving our holidays their cheer.  One such place was Halloweentown.  Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) was Pumpkin King and the reason the holiday was always so successful.<br /><br />However, he was bored with his job.  One day, he stumbled upon the entrance to Christmastown and was immediately captured by the happiness and good feelings he produced.  He immediately decided that this year, he would run the holiday himself with the help of his Halloweentown cronies.  Only Sally (Catherine O'Hara) seems to think this is a bad idea.  Will Jack be able to pull it off?<br /><br />I must confess, I've only seen this movie twice, and I haven't exactly gone out of my way to see it either time.  I did enjoy it more the second time around.  This is a twisty holiday tale that I think is more suited for Halloween than Christmas.  And I think one reason I enjoyed it more was watching it this time of year instead of later.  And I better appreciated many of the great gags as the residents of Halloweentown prepared for the holiday.<br /><br />The movie is over half music, with the songs having been written by Danny Elfman.  While I wouldn't call most of the songs catchy, they are amusing and certainly keep the story moving forward.<br /><br />Two problems seem to plague the movie, at least for me.  One is the fact that it is stop motion animation.  As bit an animation fan as I am, I have never quite gotten into it.  This form seems stilted to me, keeping me from truly getting involved in the film.  Which leads to the second problem.  While the story moves forward nicely, I never truly feel like we get to know the characters.<br /><br />While Disney may have released it, this movie certainly isn't for young kids.  Some of the images are downright scary.  Older kids and adults will enjoy the humor and jokes scattered throughout the piece, however.<br /><br />This isn't your normal holiday movie.  But it just might be growing on me.  I certainly enjoyed it more the second time around than I did the first.y enjoyed it more the second time around than I did the first.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|With all the \\"foaming at the mouth\\" reviews about this album, both for and against, I figured it was a waste of time to add anything further. But, after a conversation with a fellow Alice in Chains fan last night I thought I'd attempt some rational thoughts.<br /><br />In many conversations and reviews I have always said that I believe AIC was the best band to come out of Seattle in the late 80s/early 90s NOT Nirvana or Soundgarden. Dirt was the best album to come out of Seattle, Rooster was the best song and Cantrell was the best guitarist - period! (Vocally...please don't make me choose between Stayley and Cornell, I love BOTH their voices)<br /><br />So I have to say I agree with both sides: 1) No this is NOT Alice in Chains, it is a Cantrell solo album and 2) I don't think that's an entirely bad thing because it's still a good album. And it bodes VERY well for the future of the band. I'm happy they have ANY new material out, no matter who in the band wrote it. After all, Cantrell wrote the majority of Facelift too, don't forget that Stayley wrote NO music and only contributed lyrics to 5 of the 12 songs.<br /><br />In fact, regardless of the title of my review, I like it better than Degradation Trip, but it's not anywhere near even my least favorite AIC album, much less Dirt! So, on that point, I don't even get you 4 star people, much less all the 5 stars!!! If Dirt, and my opinion both Facelift and Jar of Flies, are 5 star albums, and the final, self titled release is a 4 star album, this is 3 stars, which is exactly what I'd give Degradation Trip. (I've always liked Boggy Depot so I'd give it 4).<br /><br />I honestly believe this was intended to BE Jerry's next solo album, no matter what they say. And they decided to stick the AIC name on it because of the success of the reunion concert tours and for increased sales over a Jerry solo release.<br /><br />Why do I believe this? Simple, because the album IS Jerry, with the other 3 playing instruments. Check the song credits; no wonder it sounds like a Cantrell solo album - he wrote (almost) the whole thing!!! #3 \\"Last of My Kind\\" was written by Cantrell and William DuVall (new singer) and #5 \\"A Looking in View\\" was written by all four of them. The rest is ALL Cantrell. And I think a lot of it was written even before the initial 2006 reunion tour (or at least many of the ideas).<br /><br />Another (primary) reason is I don't hear much of bassist Mike Inez in here (and I don't mean his playing). Those of you around back in 1993 remember how big of an influence on the band's sound he was when he joined. You could REALLY hear his influence on Jar of Flies and the self-titled final album; that influence is NOT on this album.<br /><br />But, on the next album, and hopefully there will be one, I fully expect to hear more of Alice in Chains THE BAND. They will write the album as a band, you'll hear more of DuVall and (especially) Inez and it will sound more like AIC rather than another Cantrell solo album, Stayley or no Stayley. I look forward to it!!a Cantrell solo album - he wrote (almost) the whole thing!!! #3 \\"Last of My Kind\\" was written by Cantrell and William DuVall (new singer) and #5 \\"A Looking in View\\" was written by all four of them.

0156030306|5.0|When I first heard of this particular title, I was surprised at the fact it's a classic I have never heard of before.  As you probably already have guessed, I never was required to read this book in high school.  After reading it, I am now of the opinion that this classic is one you must never miss!<br /><br />The story is about a 33-year-old man, Charlie Gordon, narrating his experiences of being transformed -- through a special surgery -- from mental retardation to a genius.  From an IQ of 68 to that of 185.  His narration was presented in the form of progress reports during his progression before and after the surgery.  In his narration, through different levels of language expressions as his intelligence increased, Charlie spoke of his anticipation of becoming smart, his encounters with various people at different points of his transformation, his emotions, and his learning and realization of harsh reality.<br /><br />With the fact that Charlie Gordon being the central character throughout the book, Daniel Keyes has masterfully captured raw emotions in his prose, locking me into a empathic relationship with the character.  Keyes ensured the language expression at different points of Charlie's transformation was appropriate without dumbing down for the sake of the simplicity of the writing, I was able to breezily read through the book.<br /><br />Truly a riveting, and eventually a heartbreaking, read!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is an amazing show. You felt like you were there watching him rehearse. It just gives you a new appreciation for Michael. I would have LOVED to see this show live. I think even in the U.S. it would have been a sold out show. This was AMAZING!!!
B002UD56I6|5.0|I went and saw MJ's movie yesterday. In fact I saw it twice, and it keeps getting better every single time!!!<br />To those who say Mike was drugged, skinny, sickly, get a life. Michael was making me tired just watching him. The only ones having trouble breathing and keeping up with him were the kids he was dancing with.<br />I remember one time in particular when they were doing a dance sequence, and when they were done, they all froze. Michael wasn't even breathing hard, but this kid next to him (in the green shirt) you all know who he is  for those who've seen the movie. Well, that kid was huffing and puffing like he just ran a hundred mile marathon. No, there was nothing wrong with Michael!<br />Watching the movie was very emotional for all those in the theater. Unlike some of the people who mentioned how they were clapping and whistling and such, our theater was quiet. And when the lights came up and everyone was leaving, there was not a dry eye in the house.<br />Do yourself a favor and go see it, and then come back here and buy the dvd, you won't regret it.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Not enough words can describe my feelings for this beautiful documentary. Michael was on top of his game. It at times seemed like the real thing making you forget that it was just rehersal footage. I have been a MJ fan all my life and will forever be. THIS IS IT depicted Michael at his best he was gentle and even authoritive at times when needed while directing steps or music sounds. The footage of a new \\"Smooth Criminal\\" done in black and white was wonderful and the military segment showing thousands of soliders behind him as he sang \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" was Hot! and the 3d version of the new \\"Thriller\\"...Wow! He was in his element and he looked happy and excited at what he was doing. It breaks my heart to know that it will never be and that this beautiful, gentle, funny, powerful, dynamic and beyond talented visonary is no longer here. I cried as he sang I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU because that is how I will always feel about Michael he will always be in my heart and I am honored to call myself a Michael Jackson Fan. Michael will be missed but his legacy will live forever. Michael was truly one of a kind no one can or ever will do it better...THIS IS IT....IS in fact wonderful RIP MJ I love you job well done and thank You for giving us your heart.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Hmmm. I am feeling like a voice in the wilderness. I like many things about this movie which shows different incarnations of love. What upset me is the portrayal of the schizophrenic brother of Laura Linney's character. In my opinion, he is an extreme case and the portrayal is scary. It perpetuates the stigma to the public and sends a message (so strong in visual media) of hopelessness to individuals suffering from mental illness and to their families as well, who already bear such a heavy burden. The writer could have portrayed this character as being out of the hospital, on the way to recovery, etc. It was just so disappointing, especially as so much of the film is well written.
B000OLDIM2|5.0|This book Shantaram was one of the 10 best books I have ever read.  Most of the chapters, marvelous in character development and story line, end in heart rending, magically well crafted words.  \\"What an astounding man!\\", I kept saying to myself....  There were many parts of it that were difficult for a woman to read (I suspect these may be easier for a man to read because there was violence and some gore) but the whole of the book was well worth it.  Knock-out reading.  I was so glad it was so long, it was that good.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Just saw the film today.  It rocks.  Michael could dance and sign as excellently as ever.  This is a documentary, not a concert film.  That said, the sound is concert-level.  The band and dancers are better even than usual.  Second best to Michael performing is seeing his creative process and how he works with other people.  I'll be seeing it at least once again before it closes.  The new Smooth Criminal vid is even better than the last one.    You don't have to think about this one.  It's not a rip, it's the real deal.
0786868724|4.0|Have a Little Faith by Mitch Albom is a true story about understanding what faith really means. When Albom's rabbi, nicknamed Reb, asks him to give the eulogy at his funeral, Albom determines to know this Man of God better so he can do the task well. Over the course of eight years, he spends time learning about the Reb's life and faith which in turn makes him re-evaluate his own. As part of a way of giving back to his adopted hometown of Detroit, he creates a fund to help out organizations that serve the homeless and poor, but only after he checks out each group. While investigating a new shelter, he meets Pastor Henry, a man with a dark past who struggles to serve his people. The Reb teaches Albom that a life truly lived is one in service to others. Henry shows him that we cannot be judged by our past alone, and that church has nothing to do with a building. While Albom gets a little squishy in saying that all faiths lead to God, there's a powerful message here about respecting others' faith. It's an enjoyable read with something for everyone.

B002H3F7F6|1.0|Hello fellow-customers! I felt compelled to put in a review of this CD, but please don't tell anyone I know that I actually bought it. It was the first time for many years where a new CD went straight into the bin....too embarassing to even try for a replacement at my favourite record store. Let's just pretend it didn't happen.    Got to say \\"Thanks for nothing\\" to the first reviewer on the UK site, who connected this in some way to The Soul Cages, a Sting album which I have always rated highly. That tempted me, yet there is no comparison. This is dreadful, and even the existence of five star reviews stuns me. (What other weird stuff do you guys listen to, I wonder....).    At least before you buy this try and check out the picture of Sting inside the leaflet, with his polo-neck and A BEARD! A pack of dried lentils can be seen protruding from his hip pocket. (Only kidding). Sting looks like a bad joke at a fancy dress party. Is he oblivious or far-too-clever-by-half about his image? If that really is Where Sting Is At, then it's \\"Goodbye Sting, it was good to listen to ya!\\"    But then it gets worse if you actually put the disc in your player. The singing is worse than the beard! Like Paul Robson crossed with Danny LaRue and a large pomegranate stuck in his jaw. It is mostly unbearable.    Ocassionally here and there (but not everywhere) some lovely music can be heard from the non-Stings involved, but then this facetious voice appears again and you think you're in some terrible nightmare where ancient vocal excercises are being attempted by a hopeless student.    So, keep your sense of humour at all times, but Sting IMHO has quite lost it with this new piece of work. It also appears to have nothing to do with Winter and certainly not with Christmas. More like Room 101.    You have been warned. All the best.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|there's not much to say, these things clip on to your triggers and make a big difference in their usability, works as advertised.

B001OQCV24|5.0|There are those of us whether christian or biblical studiers, and we see events that have happened since we have been able to understand what the Christ and His prophets have forewarned of what would happen to the apocalyptic generation of today. The 21st century started on a bad event(9/11) by the islamic henchmen of Osama Bin Laden(the anti-christ, when Iran gets its nuclear bomb(s) and events that have happened on a natural scene(deadly earthquakes, cataclysmic tsunami of 2004, deadly hurricanes and typhoons, and worldwide wild fires). But the middle-eastern wars in Iraq and Afghanistan(no one is trying to walk away) is going to lead to the unthinkable, because time is being made for the right government to get the weapon other governments don't want that government to have. Rest assured when that small nation gets it, it will use it like suicide bombers use theirs without caring about the personal consequences. 2012, from what I've seen on Youtube gives a look into the 7(seven) last plagues of Revelation chapter 16. We have been warned for almost 2000 years since the Christ left to set up the spiritual world up for His christians. 2033 is coming, and 2012 is the beginning of the 21 year countdown to end of the natural creation. This country and its serious immorality is the reason for its downfall; America, the Rome, Sodom/Gomorrha or Babylon of the modern age! Remember, WE WERE WARNED!!!!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|I love the Beatles and I love this set, but I have to say, as beautiful as the packaging is made, I seem to be one of the few who is disappointed with the box.  The CDs are simply stacked on top of each other in two \\"bins\\" of the box.  This means that (a) you cannot simply grab the disc you want (unless the one you want happens to be one top) without taking out all the ones on top of it, (b) it's easy mess up the chronological order of the discs by forgetting where exactly in the pile to replace one you took out, (c) there's a lot of extra handling just to get the CD you want, and (d) you cannot neatly see all the discs lined up side by side.  I wish they opted for some sort of box where each disc simply slides into a specific slot.  Other than that, this set is great!

B00012FXAE|5.0|Let's just get it out in the open:  Sequels, generally speaking, suck.  They're contrived, redundant, unimaginative, and pitiful--mere superficial shells of the films that spawned them.  However, there are exceptions to this incontrovertible, and ALIENS is one of them.  This James Cameron (and who is more fitting to follow Ridley Scott in this sci-fi/horror series?) techno thriller is every bit as gruesome good as its predecessor; and because we have aliens (as in plural) almost jumping out of the hulls and hatches Cameron has more super gore to work with.  Yeah, this is one fun flick.<br /><br />We are re-introduced to Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who, at fiftsomething years later (she's been sleeping in a vagabond spacecraft), finds herself quite alone and much disturbed from her own unique close encounter.  (Weaver is, once again, fantastic.)  She teams up with a hearty band of space marines (Hoo-raww!) and returns to the planet where all the fun first began--a planet now being colonized, only the settlers have all disappeared.  Of course we know why they've disappeared, and once the marines realize what kind of a mess they're in the fun really begins.  The supporting cast is great, including Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and a young Bill Paxton as a wide-eyed, expletive-spitting marine.  Cameron delivers suspense, special effects, and heart-pounding action by the boatload, including an ingenious battle between Ripley (inside a hydraulic lift) and the queen alien that's every bit of sensational.  ALIENS is a true exception to the rule; yeah, sequels suck, but not this one.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0679420266|5.0|Camus's landmark investigation into the human psyche explores the nuance of morality and the futility of life. A dark and deeply moving story.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|The sound quality of the stereo remixes in this set is superb. Maybe the best remastering of CD's I have heard. Dramatically more clear, detailed, and powerful than the Definitive Edition remasters that preceded them.  The albums themselves are priceless; each among the best ever in rock. One of the greatest bands ever at their peak.  Absolutely essential set.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is my favorite movie. I have always enjoyed this movie long before Patrick Swayze past away.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|Absolutely from all the vomit after listening to this waste of cd. Stink, er I mean Sting hasn't made a LISTENABLE album since 1993, ever since then his album sales have declined with each new release. I suppose this will follow suit and be a loser like the last five or six albums. Setting all that aside, this cd is really bad because Sting's vocals on some of the tracks are like nails on a chalkboard irritating and flat out terrible. It's like he's purposely trying to ruining the songs. The music is uninspiring and grey. Two of the songs he has already recorded years ago, one as a B-side and the other one on a previous album. Sting has been washed up for YEARS and this cd is just another sad example of this being true. What next? Great American Songbook, Soulbook, Songs of the 80's?
0385504225|4.0|\\"Lost Symbol\\" is Dan Brown's fifth novel and third featuring Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon.  He's Jack Bauer in a tweed coat.  Lost Symbol takes a slight departure from the other Langdon tomes; instead of skirting all around Europe, all of the action takes place in Washington, DC.  The ideology that gets the Dan Brown treatment are the Freemasons.    I liked the book.  Lost Symbol is fast-paced and is a rapid page turner at several junctures.  The Freemason stuff and historical info about Washington DC is interesting.  The arch-villain, Mal'ach is a much more intriguing character than the ones in \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\" The plot is also not cluttered with layers and layers of traitors and double-crossers as in the other two Langdon novels.  The plot twist near the end of the book is a doozy.    As good as it was, there are some things I didn't care for.  The Langdon formula gets wearisome.  You get the impression that if Robert Langdon was in peril and he came across a Sunday New York Times Crossword Puzzle, Robert Langdon would have it filled out in a span of a minute.  Some of the symbology mysteries and their resolution border on the \\"Are you kidding me?\\" variety.  The plot has some holes in it.  For example, the CIA operatives ineptitude borders on the Keystone Cops or something.  It seems like the book went 20 pages too long.  The anticipated \\"big ending\\" of something truly mystical just never transpires.    But all said, Dan Brown is our most important author of this decade.  His long awaited release is well worth reading.
B000MV90IU|5.0|I purchased this DVD about a month ago. I had it on VHS but that didn't do this movie justice. So when I found out it was on Blu-ray I jumped at the chance to buy it. I am a Big Steve McQueen fan. I think this is one of his best movies. People always talk about the car chase in this movie & you will not be disappointed. Plus Steve did all of his own stunts back then. The chase scene with Steve & the bad guy on the runway was exciting as well. If you love Steve McQueen then this should be at the top of your list.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|This is awesome and totally what I am buying father, uncle and brother for Christmas this year!  The quality is amazing which hearing Edge remastered makes perfect sense.  You can really tell the effort and time that went in to producing these packages.  Another great re-issue for the collection!
B002HNA95E|5.0|it is Madonna, it is her music, it is her legacy. BTW, you can actually hear that the songs have been remastered, the sound on Express yourself and like a prayer is more crisp.  Great product, do not hesitate.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is probably the only band with a girl lead singer I like, their style is new and refreshing to me. The whole album is really a nice pop rock album with great vocals from Hayley Williams. I highly recommend this album from Paramore including their previous and brand new album that just recently came out. This album will always remain my favorite from Paramore.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|No long protracted review -- I have a pretty good stereo ($10K+ range -- no name brand bragging).  And all I have to say is these CDs sound SWEET! I was going to sample one before I went out for a nice steak dinner. You know what...I can't tear myself away. Dinner's a sandwich & milk.  Oh and the sweet sound of these CDs in the background. My review -- they're awesome!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|OOO, this movie was good!!! I loved her Russian accent, seeing as I'm Russian<br />you can understand. The acting was good and there was some spooky moments. I loved the twist ending. I already knew how it ended since I read the spoiler, but it was still cool seeing it happen. This movie reminded me of Don't Look Now, the Ring 2 and the Good Son.If you seen those movies, you would know why.<br />Anyway, knowing from the start that the orphan was a psycho didn't put a damper  on the film at all. Great altogether.
B0025KVLSI|3.0|I bought this to hear the difference between my old cd with this new one and it seems to sound the same. A lot of info in the case though
B002GZQYMK|5.0|It's not the music as we know it. We can not compare it to what we knew so far.     Cause what Muse does is a new passage to rock music. Since the \\"Bliss\\", they are doing it so well, pushing the boundries of our rock sound with plenty of symphonic and electronic arrangements and tunes.     It's a journey for us, leaving from the industrial rock sounds to a new era.     It's something else. It's the new world of rock music.     And when you look at it from this perspective, it's brilliant.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I decided to get this CD when I saw some of my favourite artists on it. Unlike most reviewers here, I haven't listened to the soundtrack to the first \\"Twilight\\" movie, so my review will be on the music here and not how much this one pales in comparison to the first.<br /><br />What an outstanding CD this is. Thom Yorke's \\"Hearing damage\\" is closer in feel to stuff off Radiohead's sound (especially the \\"Hail to the thief\\" CD) than stuff off his bleak but beautiful electronic debut. Lykke Li comes off all Bj&ouml;rk-like on the lush dirge/hymn-like ballad \\"Possibility\\". The dramatic \\"A white demon love song\\" by The Killers sounds like some distorted Beatles song and is brilliant! \\"I belong to you (New moon mix)\\" by Muse is a shorter mix from the version found on their fab recent album \\"The resistance\\", editing out he French and Freddie Mercury-like bits.<br /><br />\\"Roslyn\\" by Bon Iver & St. Vincent is a pretty ethereal ballad. \\"Shooting the moon\\" is a sublime yet poppy turn from Ok Go. \\"Slow life\\" is a beautiful acoustic ballad by Grizzly Bear, while The Editors turn in the piano ballad \\"No sound but the wind\\" (very unlike anything on their recent heavily electronic album, I might add).<br /><br />That's it for the acts I know. The other songs are just as outstanding, from the Radiohead channelling \\"Meet me on the equinox\\" by Death Cab For Cutie, the crunchy rocker \\"Friends\\" by Band of Skulls, the ballad \\"Satellite heart\\" by Anya Marina, to the absolutely stunning piano/string instrumental \\"New moon (The meadow)\\" by Alexandre Desplat (which is right up there with the instrumentals off Quentin Tarentino's \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" soundtrack).<br /><br />Edgy, but still very accessible. Brilliant!
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Okay...I'm not a big CD buyer, so when i decided to buy taylor's fearless platinum ed...it was big for me. i have a friend with the original version and i loved everyone on it. So with 6 new songs i finally decided to buy it when this edition came out, i bought it!!! i absolutely LOVE the new songs!!! \\"untochable\\" has to be my favorite its catchy and so easy to relate to, we've all been there. Can't wait to see her in concert. If You're a \\"Swifty\\" fan this is deff worth the buy with all the bonus stuff that is also great quality!
B000QXDED6|2.0|This is an entertaining movie to a point.  Yes, it's based on fact, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to say just how much.  I was expecting to see a regular historical movie but was very disappointed in the fact that it had \\"supernatural\\" occurances and creatures.  Also, I'm not deaf in the least, but I and my husband had a lot of trouble understanding some of the dialog.  Would I recommend this movie...no.
B0017I1FP8|2.0|If there's one thing I like about Zimmer and Newton-Howard's scores for Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, it's that the sound is very appropriate--dark, fluttering, menacing. That's great, but any Hollywood film composer is proficient enough at his craft to write some percussive electronic bass parts and string tremolos to create a dark and fluttering sound quality. What this score is really lacking is a sense of identity. Take the theme for Batman himself, for instance--two notes. 2 freaking notes. Some would argue that that the simplicity of the theme lends it a sense of power; I would argue that it's not really a theme at all, just a placeholder. The same goes for the Joker's new \\"theme\\", which consists of a single glissando. Zimmer and Newton-Howard's approach of extremely one-dimensional themes for major characters in this series BEGS the question: do they really think that their approach is the best one, or are they just not up to the task of creating some musical ideas for the franchise that are more intelligent in construct?     Let's return to the idea of the Joker's theme. It does portray a sense of lunacy, but doesn't represent the actual character of the Joker in any meaningful way. The glissando just as easily could have been applied to the Scarecrow in Batman Begins, and it would have worked just as well. I'll reiterate my point that Zimmer and Newton-Howard have created an effective sound for the franchise, but not a satisfying identity, and it's a sore absence. For the joker, why not write some carnival-esque music, employing unbalanced percussion and some comic book swing? I'm not asking for a full concert suite, a la \\"The Imperial March\\" for Darth Vader. Even a theme as simple as the \\"Doctor Octopus\\" theme from Spider-Man 2 (a FAR superior sequel superhero score) would have been great. The glissando is a nice touch, and I don't mind its presence--I DO mind that Zimmer and Newton-Howard think that it adequately portrays the Joker.    In this light,I think that Zimmer and Newton-Howard missed some glaring opportunities to unleash power in their score by refusing to do anything brave. This is Zimmer's 1,492,473,859th score to employ electronic bass and tremolo strings, and the method isn't any more effective this time around than it was back at score #1.
B00288KNJU|4.0|I would echo other reviews of \\"Coraline\\" - an absolute wow on the 2D BLU RAY image - but gimmicky, dark and blurry on the 3D version.<br /><br />This is aimed at both the kids and their accompanying parents - childlike enough to capture the wee ones for two hours, but adult enough in other ways to keep us old-folk glued. My 11 and 15 year olds loved it, though I would say it might be a bit 'too' scary for children younger than that (it's quite sinister in parts - this is not saccharine Disney, but Tim Burton territory - and he rarely panders nor holds back).<br /><br />Four flimsy card glasses are provided for the 3D version (you choose either 2D or 3D from the main menu), but as you watch it, they irritate and you're far too aware of them. Pixar's \\"Up\\" had proper 3D glasses when we went to see it at the cinema and they made a huge difference to both the quality of the 3D effect and the comfort (too busy enjoying the film to notice).<br /><br />The 2D version couldn't be more different. The BLU RAY image is awesome - really bringing out the workmanship that went into each shot. The richness of the animation and the hugely imaginative way all the characters look in every single scene - it's all an absolute blast. The vocal work is typically ace too (Dakota Fanning shines) and the story of parents and their children straying apart is like a dark Brothers Grimm tale that will unfortunately ring too true for many. The extras are superb too. Shame the whole thing is let down by the 3D side of things.<br /><br />To sum up - and despite some niggles - the gobsmacking beauty of the print, the great voice talent and the dead clever grown-up story make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />This is one you'll watch again and again - and your kids will impress their friends with it.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0013NAP2G|5.0|out of all the concert tours she has done in the past, i consider this her best. her past tours seem very boring and dull compared to this. this one has more glamor and the most artistic thing she has done. i love all the outfits she had worn. the one where she wears a black cape, bra, and black shorts was very sexy!!! her body looks amazing!!!! she has great curves. the dresses that she wore are so beautiful. her voice is not what it used to be and it shows during the vision of love performance, but i really enjoyed seeing all the great costumes and her wonderful performances. i particularly thought lovers and haters segment was interesting and funny to watch.
0385504225|4.0|The story kept my attention till the very end just like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\".
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|wasn't a good day to write eh dan;  this book was terrible especially the way it ened. thats about all i can say. wish i would have read some of the other reviews             rick
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I have most of the songs on this CD in mp3s. But the CD has wav quality music in it and I really appreciate the clarity of the songs. This disc has a lot of \\"new upcoming\\" MJ fans in mind who never bought his old albums or best of albums. The extras on the disc were marvelous. I generally am happy with this. The booklet is great too.<br />I miss MJ.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I liked but didn't love this cd. I really prefer the Eagles Heartache Tonight and Van Morrisons Crazy Love in comparison to Bubles versions, however I really did like Baby(you've got what it takes) and Whatever it Takes. These two songs make the cd worth checking out. The whole thing has a jazzy feel and  if you like horns with that \\"big band sound\\" this cd is for you.
B001CP4VMU|4.0|Continuing Burton has a gothic gritty dark style Nolan has a more realistic crime drama & realistic villains but I prefer Jack Nicholson's Joker he felt more like the Joker but Heath Ledger's Joker clicked very well for me too he just sucks you into his performance. No knock on Christian Bale his Batman just seems way to invincible & I do relate to Micheal Keaton's Bruce Wayne more so than Bale's. Honestly I wouldn't compare 89 Batman with The Dark Knight I would compare it with Batman Returns. I know I have pï$$ê* off a lot of comic book fanboys & Dark Knight fanboys with this review.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm not big on work out videoes but I'm loving this one.  It's quick, to the point and works!  The work out is very diverse so it never get boring and you can't beat getting a total work out in only 20 minutes.    I've read where some of the other commenters have had problems with their knees.  I had an ACL reconstruction a few years ago on my right knee and have no problems doing any of these moves.  The only pain I have is the burn from making my muscles work.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I give 'shiver' five stars for three reasons. First of all, I love all the the indepth description that Maggie gives the readers. You feel like your part of the story which makes it easier to get distracted for the rest of the world. Secondly, I love the suspence that you have to agonize through, all the way up to the last couple of pages. You read it, and you just have to let out a sigh of relief. Lastly, I just adore the bits of comedic language she slids into it. My favorite example is when Sam and Grace are discribing each other, and everytime Grace says something about him, he translates it. Maggie chose to have Sam say he was 'Dangerously emo', and I just couldn't help but start rolling on my bed laughing, trying to imangine the face Sam made when he said that. Overall, it's a kick awesome book. I can't wait for the sequel.
B002MW50KY|4.0|I like Dylan's Christmas album a lot. I wouldn't argue that this is one of Bob's greatest albums -- it's certainly no Blood on the Tracks or Highway 61 -- but I think it sounds pretty darn good, although I'll admit to being a sucker for most Christmas music. I guess it's a matter of personal taste.     I'm not at all surprised that Bob did a Christmas album -- it seems very likely that he's listened to a lot of that stuff. Everyone remembers the pop singers like Andy Williams who've recorded Christmas music, whom you might not imagine Bob listening to, but there's also a long history of old-time country, blues, jazz, and R&B holiday music -- Bob featured some of it on his own 2-hour XM Christmas show. (Anyone interested in some unusual and amazing traditional blues, country, and international Xmas tunes -- check out \\"Where Will You Be Christmas Day?\\" from the Dust-to-Digital label.)     The Louvin Bros., Johnny Cash, Elvis, Charlie Parker, the Maddox Bros. & Rose, Al Jolson, the Everlys, the Staples, BB King, Miles Davis, Pete Seeger (and his half-siblings), Duke Ellington, and even Bessie Smith all recorded one or more Christmas songs or albums. These are artists with whom Bob is undoubtedly familiar (and probably likes), and if I had my Christmas CD collection here, I could name dozens of others.     And let's not forget Bing Crosby, the Voice of Christmas. Bob's recent Modern Times album shows very strong influences of Crosby (with Bob actually re-writing some of Bing's 30s hits), so I'd guess that Dylan not only grew up hearing Bing, but has listened to him a lot since then, including his large Christmas catalog. Is it any surprise that Bob would follow Bing into the Christmas genre?     Then there are Bob's musical contemporaries, like Chuck Berry, the Beatles (together and individually), Aretha Franklin, Phil Spector, Booker T & The MGs, Leon Redbone, and many others, all of whom have recorded Christmas tunes.     So it makes perfect sense to me that Bob is joining this long line of   musical artists in recording some Christmas music. He obviously knows   the genre well and has melded the polished \\"traditional\\" holiday musical arrangements with his own style -- including some pedal steel guitar, accordian, and other elements of his recent recordings. It sounds fine to me.     I kind of wonder if he was going for a sound like the Louvin Bros. Christmas album, which has polished arrangements that still have a strong country flavor. I've always liked that album a great deal, and I think Bob has captured some of that sound.     One big difference, of course, is that Bob doesn't have the vocal purity that the Louvins did, so perhaps he would have done better in a rougher style, drawing more on blues-, country-, and R&B-based Christmas songs (including the Louvins' own holiday song \\"It's Christmas Time\\"), rather than holiday standards. One possible alternative model might have been Ben Keith's Christmas album \\"Seven Gates,\\" which had less polished but well-played arrangements and featured guests like Neil Young and Johnny Cash (not that I would have wanted one of those cheesy \\"guest star\\" albums -- which Ben's is not). Ben, who is a longtime steel guitarist for Young, did include well known Christmas standards on his album (overlapping some with Bob's selections), but he also used some less known holiday songs, and the arrangements give them all a consistent style that works well, in my opinion. Bob has done something similarly successful.     Christmas songs can be hard to do right unless the artist chooses the right songs and right arrangements for his/her personal style. So I understand that some folks might not go for this album, esp. those who don't think Bob should record other songwriters' tunes or those who don't like the more polished arrangements of much holiday fare. But I like holiday standards, and I like unusual versions of those songs in unexpected styles -- and that's what Bob has given us. (Plus I actually wrote to Bob's XM Radio e-mail address about a year ago to suggest that he record a Xmas record -- no kidding. I'm absolutely sure that I had nothing to do with him doing so, but even if not, he gave me what I wanted.)     And it's very, very cool that he's donating the proceeds to charities that feed the hungry. Maybe he's emulating Dickens now, as well as the old bluesmen.     Good job, Bob, and Merry Christmas.
0385504225|2.0|Whatever entertainment value this book offers is completely offset by Dan Brown's worn-out style of writing.  If you've read his other works, you know what I'm referring to.  That \\"bad\\" guy that pops up in the first third of the book?  They're definately going to end up helping our hero.  The really evil character will always be involved in some plot twist that you never saw coming (only if, of course, you are literally blind).  Every chapter will involve a lecture on history or art, and Robert Langdon, in spite of \\"recoiling in shock\\" and \\"staring in amazement\\" through two previous novels involving explosive revelations, will always and forever deny any theory that any character proposes, only to be \\"shocked\\" or \\"dismayed\\" upon learning its truth ten pages later.<br /><br />Also, the stupid cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter may have been effective the first time around Dan, but four novels later they are just annoying.  You spend all of your energy building suspense, only to leave us unsatisfied at the end of a chapter when you switch scenes.  I think it would be much more effective if we didn't see conflict coming a mile away, and if you occasionally surprised us with something unexpected.  I thought your previous Langdon novels were extremely entertaining, and fun.  While this novel serves its purpose (making money), I think you can do much better in the future.  I would like to see you stray from your own formula.
B000BWI9U0|4.0|Maturation is a process required for any band to truly continue the artistic process. Quite simply, if The Strokes kept repeating the formula for \\"Is This It?\\", then we would very soon tire of them.     As music enthusiasts, we should mature as well. Hopefully, we do so with the artists we admire and can continue to relate with the music they submit for our approval. As I fast approach middle age, the first Strokes offering seemed a little dis-jointed and more for the \\"kids\\" (in fact, my son is who turned me on to these guys).    This album, however, hits home with me. \\"Ask Me Anything\\" reminds me of all the reasons I gave up the dream of being a rock star, myself. \\"You Only Live Once\\" may be one of the greatest album openers of all time. This band has truly developed into something special, and in my humble opinion, this is easily their best recording.     They have developed their talent, both in their instrumental skills and songwriting ability. Without \\"First Impressions\\", The Strokes would be \\"mediocre at best\\", but with this addition to their catalog they become one of the few \\"Over Achievers\\" of the last decade.
B002TX06RI|4.0|White Collar is a frothy, funny, fun to look at show in the manner of Psych, Chuck and Burn Notice, my favorite shows on now.  Both leads are excellent - showing there is more to them than expected - and the dialogue is very good.  Like C, P and BN, you have to have a strong suspension of disbelief - plot holes abound - but it is fun to watch the interaction of the leads.  If we're lucky, they will develop the characters in a way where we really care about them (like in Chuck and to a lesser extent, Burn Notice).  Since we have OTA TiVO, I have to watch them either online, or via Amazon - even with the per show fees, it is cheaper to buy ala carte than pay $50-$80 per month for HD cable or satellite.  Video on Demand ROCKS!
B000GPIPT2|5.0|Fully restored after years of unfortunate censorship cuts, director James Whale's &#34;Frankenstein&#34; (1931) has lost none of its chilling power. The rough-edged production values and lack of a music score work in the movie's favor. Boris Karloff gained celluloid immortality with his classic portrayal of the Monster — a multifaceted performance that does not overshadow Colin Clive's brilliant intensity as Henry Frankenstein. Special kudos to makeup genius Jack Pierce and the influential art direction of Charles D. Hall. Thanks to Whale's gothic flair, this Universal adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel helped define the horror genre while cementing its place in cinema history.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|First, let me say that /anything/ that changes a function of a videogame controller is either going to produce love or hate reactions from gamers.  Hands and tastes vary.    For me, however, this simple 5 dollar purchase made the lower shoulder buttons on my controller easier to use.  With the original design, my fingers had to curl a lot more to get the full range of response from those two buttons.    Simply tops, in my opinion, and worth the five bucks.
B002AAC90C|3.0|This is a great show, and I was quite near the stage!  Unfortunatelly the sound quality of this CD is not a big thing, but just barelly good. Unfurtunatelly the concert is not complete and there are some songs missing. Anyway, I think it's a good CD, specially for collectors. I did enjoy, because I didn't expect a better sound quality. I was just disappointed about some missing songs from the concert. I reccomend.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I totally enjoyed Michael Buble's new CD, Crazy Love.  There wasn't a song I didn't like.  The new, original song Haven't Met You Yet, is very catching and a song that makes you smile.<br /><br />I can't wait for my mother to hear this, she will love, Stardust is a favorite song of hers.<br /><br />The orchestra is great and Michael's voice very smooth.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I was unsure at first when I got this CD because I don't listen to secular music, I like Christian music, I wasn't sure if there would be curse words in it or not, I knew there was a song in the CD that refers to God \\" I look to you\\" so I took my chances. I was surprised to find that there are no curse words in this CD plus well, Whitney...there is no other Whitney, she has an awesome voice.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|This album just gets better every day.  Every song plays off the next one.  It is awesome.  I can't wait for the next album.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I've seen the movie and the many spoofs so I thought I knew the plot, but when I finally sat down to read the Mary Shelley classic, I was taken back by the intellectual undertones and concept by which the plot of the book plays out.  Yes there is a scientist who creates a being and brings it to life.  And yes there is a central \\"monster\\" that creates havoc.  However, it is more than just a scary story.  The commentary on the potential risks to society caused by technology can be taken into account today.  You also learn that the \\"monster\\" is not some mindless being, but there is a back story.  I'm only disappointed in the fact that it took me so long to pick up this book to read.
0060574216|5.0|The outrageous novel which has its heights of throne on each and everyone's mind is The MEN are from MARS and WOMEN are from VENUS. The most important relationships manual since the book redefined the boundaries of how men and women relate. Men and Women are different, we all know that, but if our genes have stood still then social changes have not. The author made an excellent quote in this book stating that sexes are quite cat and rat. As you go on and on and on your stress levels will be depressed and you can see the calmness inside your body through the blood streams. I felt it. This book gives out everything which everyone in this competitive world need to know, follow, and adhere for a better relationship. While reading it one or the other feels in his/her memories. The author had extra knowledge in bringing out the essentials for how a relation is and how it must be. I was stunned to read because as I went on the topics I could able to feel how I was and it made me that U must be like this. The futuristic approach and a splendid language made it to be the best seller novels at the time. On reading this book a false relation can turn into blooming blossom and understanding begins to flourish. It has its own version of making people to understand with way it was written. Am sure that no one can write that clear about human tendency. One can improve relationships by understanding how Men and Women cope differently with stress. Since it deals about the real relationship of Men and Women it is awesome to own one copy.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is one of the best releases of new music I have heard in a long time.
0786891181|5.0|I was amazed to read this book as it shows that love can expressed to the dear ones irrespective of where they are. I mean heaven or hell. It is an awesome book which everyone must have a glance at least to its abstract. This book which deals with the story of a married girl who is of 30 years old had taken away the tears of sad ones. It s all about that how she manages her day to day life after her husband dies. It isn't a sad story or something negative rather it would give courage to one who s left alone. The author has carved in his thoughts to how a girl can manage her life when she becomes a widow.<br />To give a gist about this book one can pen down all daylong their views on this.

By this way she leads a peaceful life with the hope that her husband sends the letter every day. The hope and the courage and the love for him have made her a successful woman.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE MICHAEL JACKSON HUMBLE LIKE ALWAYS AND HIS CREW SHOWED HOW MUCH THEY LOVE AND RESPECT HIM.YOU MUST SEE THE MOVIE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.........  LONG LIVE HTE KING. ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS AND LIVES...........
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went into \\"This Is It\\" with some pretty high expectations, as I knew that Michael would have had quite a concert prepared for his fans.  I never expected anything close to what he actualy had lined up!  This would have truely been one of the most memorable concerts/tours in music history.  The sets, songs, theatrics, dancing and Michael himself all compiled into 2 hours of pure music heaven!    As for the actual movie, it really isn't nearly as \\"grainy\\" or \\"gritty\\" as I have read in other reviews and I was actually quite pleased with both the sound and the picture quality.  As everyone probably knows by now, the auduence gets a behind the scenes look at Michael rehearsals for his then upcoming shows in London.  It feels much more like you are actually watching him in concert though, except for his pausing to give instruction in his gentle Michael-like way.  You would never guess he is close to 50, as he can still dance like he did 25 years ago and does not seem to have lost much on his voice either.    This really was a great movie and I am looking forward to watching again and again.
0887308589|5.0|This book is a good summary of your work life with a killer sense of humor. Only disturbing fact is that everything written in this book is true.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|\\"All I Wanted\\" is a song that any lady can relate too and her singing voice is truly unique.  She has an unbelievable range to her voice and she uses it in a rocker way, very interesting and entertaining.  Keep in mind, the lead singer is not even 21 yet, this is her band's 3rd CD and after almost breaking up this past year they came back stronger than ever.  Support the youths, support the talented, listen to this CD.      Sadly I'm not paid for that promotion, but I like them that much!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"THIS IS IT\\"...is spectacular, just as I expected.  MJ wanted nothing but the best for his fans and that's exactly what he delivered during every performance... Superb!!!  The only difference was that he had greater and extravagant stage presentations.  My personal favorites were \\"Thriller\\" and Smooth Criminal\\" both were 3D. A must see for MJ fans and an opportunity for none fans to discover his legacy. He looked good and physically fit.  There is no doubt in my mind, knowing how much of a perfectionist the man was, that he would've been able to do all 50 concerts in London.  Lastly, I hope this movie finally puts to rest the rumors of his supposedly frail 50 year old body.  Heck...The man danced as well as he did over 25 years ago. A legend NEVER Dies!!! Long Live The King Of Pop!!! Love You 4ever Michael!!!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|great wonderful perfect movie!!! good condition. and on time. I watch it over and over again. LOVE IT!
159448385X|5.0|This is one of those books I really didn't want to read.  I had heard it was depressing and I like for my hobby-life to be enjoyable.<br /><br />But, I gave into the hype and read this book and I'm glad I did; it was mesmerizing, beautiful, terrible, horrifying and sad.  I can compare it only to something like Number the Stars--a startlingly sad book but one everyone should read once in their lives.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw \\"THIS IS IT\\" yesterday night. It was amazing, unforgetable.  What a wonderful show. I'm sure, everybody will love him and his performance.  R.I.P King of POP
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Great to hear new music from these guys again.  New singer/guitarist William DuVall fits in with the band quite well.  His vocals blend well and he complements the overall AIC sound.<br /><br />Do I miss Staley?  Sure.  But the poor guy chose the wrong path.  Time to move forward.<br /><br />I hate to fall into the cliche, but I like the first single the best out of all the tunes on this new record.  We hear Cantrell more than DuVall in this track, but it sounds like vintage Alice.<br /><br />I hope they tour behind this record and that they come to my little one-horse hick town.
B0000793Z9|5.0|This album transcends the 80s genre. Every song is amazing. Give me a break.... I loved this album (yes, I have the gold vinyl platter) and listening to it again reminds me 1. why i loved it and 2. I was right to love it. This album by Simple Minds rocks!!!
0385504225|5.0|As a fan of Dan Brown's I can say that all of his books prior to this one are retellings of the same story. Now with \\"The Lost Symbol\\" Brown has actually told another story! Good job, Dan!    I'm not going to make a thorough review here since so many others have already done so, so I'll just end this by saying that I enjoyed this novel immensely.
B000F4LPJ6|2.0|If you're one of the many who already have seen and love this movie, that's great. My review is for those who haven't seen it yet and are considering dropping the $ to buy the DVD.    In my honest opinion, the movie failed as an action film, as a 'dark comedy', as a drama, etc. The cartoonish violence may turn some on -- if you're the type that loves cartoony or over-the-top violence, this might be your kind of film. I admit I like other films that might be lumped into the same category -- Kill Bill, Sin City, Watchmen -- but these films also benefited from creative cinematography, unique style and production value, excellent soundtracks, etc.    The film verion of 'Battle Royale' just didn't do it for me, though. For one, the cinematography is very plain and the color saturation throughout the film is kind of faded. Maybe done intentionally, but it took away from my enjoyment. The soundstrack is vanilla, the acting is vanilla (maybe it's great for Asian films, but I dunno, because I've seen many Asian films with more compelling acting AND a better concept, like 'Thirst' or 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring', 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', etc.), and the violence, while \\"over the top\\", is not really \\"over the top\\" enough to make up for its cartoonishness.    Regardless of whatever social commentary they were going for, the makers of this film didn't really have me laughing, cringing, cheering, crying, or gripping my seat. I was sorta bored throughout. I didn't care about Nanahara (or however you spell it) and his little crush's struggle to survive. Why? Because you already know from the onset that they're going to make it. I also didn't really think the 'over the top' violence was all that cool. I mean, for one, the blood looks like pink grapefruit kool-aid. High school girls absorb a full clip of submachinegun rounds in the torso and then stagger about murmuring cliche lines before slumping in a heap. Mannequins with Japanese schoolkid uniforms and strapped with bags of ketchup explode on-camera. An old grumpy Japanese dude walks around talking about how bratty kids are. Is it really all that incredible?    However, I can admit that maybe I'm just missing it with this film & review. Surely lots of people really enjoyed the film, but the fact remains that I didn't. I'm upping my review from 1 to 2 stars because this isn't really a 1-star film. I didn't LOATHE it. But, on the other hand, I didn't like it either.    So if you already know you love this movie, buy it. More power to you. If, however, you're thinking of seeing it for the first time and are not fanatical about this type of cheesy Asian exploitation film... you might think about renting it or borrowing a copy first. I know I'm not the only one out there who isn't totally in love with this film, and you might do yourself the favor of checking it out before dropping your hard-earned cash on the DVD.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|First, Bonamassa's guitar playing is hard edged blues.  You can certainly pick up some of his influences in his playing.    The overall quality of this DVD is outstanding.  Very well produced and mixed.  Lots of natural reverb at the Royal Albert.    A very heartfelt moment when Clapton appears on stage with Bonamassa....obviously one of his idols.    The band is great, especially the horn section.  Two drummers was interesting at first, but after watching......it seems to add depth.    Bonamassa is a great live performer.  Watching him live like this is almost better than just listening to an audio only performance.  If you have a good Dolby Digital system, it will blow you away!    Overall impression:  Top notch smokin' blues!  Buy it!
0316044695|5.0|I have an autographed copy of this book.  It is an incredible story.  Lutrell doesn't hold back as he gives all the details.  The team gets discovered by an afghan local and must decide whether to kill him or not to avoid getting compromised.  They are concerned about facing  murder charges.  I recommend this book to anyone wanting to read a great American war story.
B002JTHFUS|4.0|This was one of the first CDs I ever got when I began my LP/cassette to CD conversion of my music library, and has been long overdue for a remaster.  I also have the MFSL mastered gold disc which is an improvement over the original issue, but this one sounds better (plus you get a bonus CD and DVD).  The only reason I give this collection 4 stars and not 5 is the incomplete performance from Amnesty International's Conspiracy of Hope concert at Giants Stadium.  Left off the DVD was \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Help!\\", \\"Sun City\\", and \\"I Shall Be Released\\" (the last four for legal and licensing reasons obviously).  The band should have bit the bullet and put up the money to license those songs for inclusion on the DVD.  That was a pivotal moment in U2's career that should have made the DVD, where The Police handed their instruments to U2 to play \\"I Shall Be Released\\": a symbolic passing of the torch from the then current World's Greatest Band to their successors.
B0001I562I|5.0|I bought three copies of the movie at Amazon's price, as I have loved this movie since my kids were in grade school, and now I am giving my grandkids' families the movie.  My husband and I watched it this weekend with 6 grandchildren, and he and they were enthralled.  As for a review of the video itself, it was flawless...no scratches, etc.
B000SZH8LQ|5.0|Listen to it and decide for yourself... Music is in the ear of the beholder... It is what our maker gave to us to enjoy on this earth. To me, this is a good representation of the beauty of music.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw the movie last night and as usual, Michael Jackson took my breath away.  He sang and danced as good as ever like he was in his 20s...it is just unbelievable that he was 50 years old.  I laughed and cried throughout the movie and did not want it to end.  He is simply the GREATEST.  I just can't believe that he is gone...I don't know if I will ever get over his death.  It is just heartbreaking to realize that he is not here with us anymore.  I just can't wrap that around my head.  As Berry Gordy said, Michael Jackson \\"was not an artist who comes along once in a decade, a generation, or a lifetime.  He was an artist who comes along only once, period.\\"  I truly believe that too.  We will never see another like him.  Michael, I love you and will love you as long as I live.  Our One and Only King.  I am going to preorder the DVD today.
0062515675|5.0|It's my duty to thank and praise the author Robin Sharma for his wonderful work on this book which has changed the way in which I used to think, speak, live, and almost everything. I felt really great and relived of my internal stresses after reading this book. Instead of saying this to be a book, it would be opting to mention it as a guide to improve the thoughts of people. It's no surprise that this book has been sold more than one million copies worldwide and been translated in to more than 50 languages. The author's way of expressing the ideas that could make our lives better by means of stating the ideas by means of a story is really brilliant. This book gives a clear picture on attaining fulfilment even in small things and makes the reader to understand that the real happiness in life rests on smallest things. This book gives a chance to the reader to think about the purpose of their life and motivate them to work towards their goal. The author's message to the world is really an important one and I bet that this book would have definitely made the readers to change their attitude toward their life. The appreciable thing is the action summary present at every chapter`s end. This book is a must read for everyone in this world, the author has the capability to express the ideas in a lucid way. From the start of a day to its end every happening will have some impact on you and this book teaches you on what basis you should respond to those incidents and how you could tackle even the worst things to make your life better day by day. Once again I thank the author of this book Robin Sharma for his splendid ideas to improve the life of the people.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Really dig this a lot, this is a great collection of songs. They left in all the PA addresses, really brings it to life. The music is great. Deadheads will love the Dark Star. Sound quality is great. You will be glad you picked it up.<br /><br />Coconut Phil.
0061766089|4.0|Design thinking is an innovation methodology, an approach to make innovation effective and efficient.<br /><br />Nobody is better positioned to write a book about innovation methodology than Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, the famous innovation and design consulting firm that contributed to the invention of the first mouse for Apple, the Palm V, Shimano's Coasting bikes, patient-provider service for Mayo Clinic, nurse knowledge exchange for Kaiser Permanente, Oral-B toothbrush, and many other important products and services.<br /><br />Brown organized Change by Design in 10 chapters, split in 2 parts. The first part, consisting of 6 chapters, introduces in detail the key innovation stages, including user observation, brainstorming, prototyping, story telling, and scenario building. The most enjoyable aspect of the first part is the numerous real-life illustrations included in each chapter.<br /><br />The second part, consisting of 4 chapters, looks ahead and deals with organizational and social issues that arise whenever the members engage in design and innovation. The most delightful aspect of this part is the Brown's \\"can do\\" attitude and his ability to demonstrate a convincing opportunity for improvement in every problem.<br /><br />Too bad the book only focuses on IDEO experiences, as otherwise it could become a great textbook. It could also benefit from a style revision and more illustrations to make it easier reading. Perhaps the next release of Brown's book will qualify for the full 5 stars.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I bought this set a couple of months ago and have been going through the entire series from the beginning when I have time. I don't know if it's the packaging or the discs themselves, but about one in every four discs has issues - either there is a lot of skipping or certain episodes won't play at all. I've tried playing these discs on several different machines, and even though there are no discernible scratches on some of the problem discs, they still won't play.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when you buy a 10 season set, you don't always find problems with it until the return period is over - so I have to keep these and hope that I can still enjoy some of it.<br /><br />***Edit***<br /><br />I ended up complaining to Amazon, and they let me return this box set, even though it was way past the usual return policy deadline. Props to Amazon. I ended up purchasing the individual season sets, and even though some of the dvds don't work perfectly (i.e. they sometimes don't let you play individual episodes by choosing the episode, but they will play the episode if you choose \\"play disc\\" and just fast forward to the appropriate place), I am now satisfied. Of course, I still don't recommend the box set.
1401394191|5.0|As an agnostic, a book titled Have a Little Faith had so little interest to me.  But since Mitch Albom is my favorite author I figured how bad can it be and if I read it with an open mind, just maybe I'd be able to get something from it.  Clearly, I made the right choice.  Like all of Mitch's books, Have a Little Faith is brilliantly written.  He captures the reader from page one and takes the reader on his journey with a dying rabbi (Reb) and a man who turns his life around (Henry).  The only bond between the two is there faith in God -- one being Jewish and the other being Christian.  In between a couple of other characters are introduced -- particularly Cass who has a beautifully defined role in the story.  This book does not preach nor does it favor either religion.  It merely suggests (as it does to Mitch) to look at yourself and perhaps refocus on the important things in life -- whether it be family, friends or faith.  In a time where the world seems to be in a frenzy -- loving one another doesn't seem like a bad thing.    Mitch:  please keep turning out these masterpieces.
0385504225|3.0|As I began the newest release of Dan Brown, I was excited. I enjoyed all of his other books very much and was really looking forward to another great thrilling fiction novel. I was thoroughly disappointed at the end of the book. I knew the basic plot of the story about 1/3 of the way through (something I hate to experience) and to top it off, the last 2 chapters kind of ticked me off. There were SEVERAL ways the book could have ended and to throw in another religious \\"breakthrough\\", if you will, didn't sit too well with me. While I realize it is a work of fiction, it still wasn't what I was expecting or something I enjoyed reading. I think if he would have stopped a little bit sooner, I may have liked it... I do appreciate where he was going for the majority of the book but to end it the way he did... I don't know... It was just ok for me.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord of the Rings CD arrived in record time.  I've never gotten anything in  as quickly.  It was in excellent condition.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B000WTZ784|4.0|The virtually unknown, and woefully under-appreciated tip of the Genesis tail is \\"Calling All Stations\\" the bands first and only \\"post-Phil\\" studio album.  It was an unmitigated commercial flop.  A tour promoting the album was 86'd halfway through in Europe and cancelled altogether in the States.  That's a real shame, because musically it stands up to the very best of Genesis.  It contains (IMHO) one of the best cuts ever for the band in \\"Uncertain Weather\\" a moving song about an unknown soldier in an old photograph.  The final cut \\"One Man's Fool\\" is an eerie condemnation of terrorism, describing a vivid 9/11 scene.  Not so strange, except the album was released in September of 1997, almost exactly 4 years before the fateful day.  If you are American this track will give you chills.    Like \\"We Can't Dance\\" \\"Calling All Stations\\" features cuts that harken back to the Genesis of old, along with those obviously tagged for radio play (Not About Us, If That's What You Need), as well as the `Mike and Mechanicsish' \\"Don't Talk Back\\" All fine for this Genesis fan, but, in the end, radio audiences failed to embrace the somewhat curious choice of Ray Wilson to replace Phil Collins.  That coupled with the even more curious choice of \\"Shipwrecked\\" as the first release- arguably the weakest cut on the album, and certainly the least `Genesis-sounding' track, proved to be a lethal concoction rendering Calling All Stations dead on arrival.  The die-hard Genesis fan wonders what the album would have accomplished commercially had Collins handled the vocals, and aided songwriting (and more importantly wonders how much better it would have sounded).  Wilson's voice is often stretched, and his limits are exposed.  Many of the songs were probably written with the belief Phil would be singing them- perhaps even some outtakes from We Can't Dance.  It could be, though, that the shadow of \\"We Can't Dance's\\" unbelievable multi-platinum commercial success was just too big to emerge from, andthat the album was doomed regardless of the quality of the music, or whether or not Phil was at the mic.  If you are a Neo-Genesis fan that enjoys the album cuts from We Can't Dance and Invisible Touch and you have not given Calling All Stations a whirl, find it and give it some spins.  If you are an old fan that knows what \\"And Then There Were Three\\" means, you have the album somewhere so dig it up, blow off the dust, and give it a few dozen run-throughs.  There is a lot of good stuff here!
B002P7UCMC|3.0|LifAD's very unsubliminal single \\"P****\\" (not sure if Amazon will censor this word in reviews or not) is the most blatant example of Rammstein's more rockin' and rollin' sound but there are also a few cuts on this album that showcase a lighter, more fun and more family-friendly sound (minus the parental-seizure inducing lyrics).  Some tracks thunder like Zeus from the mountaintop but for the most part, this is Rammstein kicking back and cutting loose.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the meaner, more mechanized, apocalyptic death-march-metal of Herzleid, Sehnsucht, and Mutter (the latter seeing Rammstein move into a more symphonic, arena metal sound which was most excellent).  Then we had Reise, Reise, then Rosenrot, and now Leibe ist fur Alle Da culminates the evolution (one could almost call it a transformation).  It's fun for what it is, and will certainly strike a chord with a larger audience, but this isn't the Rammstein I grew up with.  Of course I don't want them stuck in 1998 but I wish they hadn't departed so drastically from the sound that made them famous.  This is just a personal preference, and I still think this album is a lot of fun.  Props to Rammstein for mixing it up and maintaining their status as one of hard music's most entertaining acts.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Yes, 2001 was quite a long time ago, and I almost forgot about all the hype surrounding the Strokes first release. Now that the Strokes are out of the spotlight, I took some time to rediscover this album which used to be one of my favorites. Completely disregarding whether the album was worth all the hype or whether the Strokes were the saviors of rock and roll or just a played up commercial band, I found this to be a very good album that I listened to again and again. With a more critical musical ear than at the time of the release, I found the rhythm and lead guitar blended together quite nicely, and the drum beats, while not very varied and lacking fills, provided a steady foundation and gave a good feel to each song.  The bass lines gave another rhythm to mix with the guitars, so overall solid and catchy instrumentation (all the songs are quite fun to play with a band.)  The vocals, although kind of repetitive and in the same style, still sounded fresh and interesting. As for lyrics, not too diverse, but still, I like many of the songs.  Among my favorites are Barely Legal, The Modern Age, Someday, and When It Started.  Overall a cool album, still one of my favorites, even after the Strokes' peak.
0446560065|4.0|I absolutely LOVE the videos online. They are brilliant, so accurate and true! But I thought the book was a bit disappointing. I give it 4 because it is great for what it is, I just thought it will be more like the videos.     I didn't like how a lot of the drawings were very \\"comic\\" like and similar to Garfield. What I love about Simon's videos is how they \\"simply\\" represent perfectly his cats and cat-like behavior. Those little things of a cat chasing and being this or that, interacting with Simon, his owner.    The book had a lot of things that had nothing real to do with cats but sort of Garfield type comic and not really like his videos.    All in all, I enjoyed the book. Just wish it had more cat and Simon and less cat acting human.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|One of the BEST  compilations of  Jazz  ever.  I play this constantly and  will probably have  to replace it.<br />Everyone  of  all ages  either  recognizes the 'music or  ask  where can they get it?'  This quartet  kicked it<br />to the moon.  What a  tight harmonious group that I seldom ever hear......honest!<br />A great Gift Item  especially for a Jazz Lover.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|I just got back from watching this in the theater. I'm glad it wasn't as annoying an experience as watching<br />The Ring in the theater. Some people just ruin the whole \\"horror at the movies\\" experience for me. ANYWAY,<br />I love this movie! It's slow building, and it takes its time building up the tension and sense of atmospheric doom.<br />My favorite types of movies! I love slow horror over gory action-packed horror any day! I know a lot of people got<br />turned off from this movie because it was very slow and boring, but I thought the \\"snail pace\\" plot development just made<br />the grand finale all the more terrifying...I knew something VERY EVIL was about to happen, and when it did, I LITERALLY jumped back in the seat and SCREAMED! Believe the hype of this one. Don't expect a fast paced gory movie that keeps your attention every 5 minutes.<br />Go in and be PATIENT....FORCE YOURSELF through all the boring arguing and bickering and obnoxious behavior from Micah..lol...and<br />you WILL be REWARDED at the very end. After saying all that...this movie is still not bloody and gory. You have to use your imagination<br />to truly scare yourself silly. Just like The Blair Witch Project...suspense without the gore. I saw this knowing it was fake, and I still enjoyed it very much! The movie does NOT have to be based on real events to be terrifying. I still love The Blair Witch Project.<br />Paranormal Activity's actors did a wonderful job.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br /><br />Micah was so redonkulous. He sure did tick that demon off! By provoking it via name calling, threats, and the Ouija Board. And look what happened to him at the end! He got chewed up and spit back out by the very mad and vengeful demon. Don't provoke demons, people!<br />They can throw (or spit) your pathetic corpse clear across the room! I was actually ready for Micah to get what was coming to him.<br />He was so annoying.<br /><br />In Conclusion, I would definatly recommend Paranormal Activity to anyone who enjoys slow paced horror that focuces on atmospheric moody suspence and dread over blood, gore, and carnage. Slow supernatural horror are my favorite type of horror films, and this one exceeded on all levels. Of course, if you are not patient and get bored easily, you will not enjoy this movie.  Peace, and Happy Halloween everyone!<br />-Stevenheric moody suspence and dread over blood, gore, and carnage.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see this the second day of it's release. I was torn about going to see it because part of me felt Michael is being exploited but if I had been able to see his concert I would have so to me it was my own way of paying homage to a creative genius. It goes without saying I will purchase this DVD. It was really amazing to hear Michael sing live, and I hope at some point the soundtrack to the movie is made into a CD. To hear Michael singing live just added a totally different depth to him as an artist. I found myself finally coming to terms with his death while watching the movie and I realized we will never get to hear any new material from this man. That's what makes it bittersweet to me. Bitter because he is no more, and sweet because watching him preparing to grace the world with his performance was so mesmerizing. I always felt Michael was a sensitive human being, but after seeing and hearing him practicing, I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been if he had been able to complete this work. I know there will be tons of things released about and by Michael, and if you have been a true fan, you have all the great material anyway. At this point you will only be replacing things. Get this DVD though because this really is it...and just think..you had a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes to see a genius at work. RIP Michael, and we love you too.
B001E3HTTC|4.0|Lisey's Story is quite possibly one of the best books that King has ever written. I am ashamed to say that I bought it off of a remainder bin, and almost chose not to buy it. It may not have the gritty edge of \\"The Stand,\\", \\"It\\" or some of his other quite popular and well-written books, but here King establishes layer upon layer of linguistic understanding, how it effects our thought-patterns, how it articulates our struggles, and most importantly how each relationship acquires a language of its own, with references that no one outside the relationship could ever understand, and as King puts it so aptly, \\"dips into that word pool from which we all go down to drink.\\"<br /><br />Though there is horror in this story, primarily in the life of Scott Landon, although Lisey does experience a horrible trauma at the hands of an utter psychopath, the primary focus is the relationship between Scott, who is a renowned author and Lisey, who is his wife. The horror does gnaw at the edges of Scott and Lisey's relationship, with small revelations on Scott's part, one truly horrifying incident during a winter storm that Lisey quickly and intentionally, if not forgets, shoves to the farthest reaches of her own mind.  The horror does not completely break through, is not entirely worked through, and triumphed over, until after Scott's death.  Scott has left her a trail of clues that she must follow to put to death not only Lisey's and Scott's demons--save one that is so overarching and unknowable that it is not overpowered, but also another which I will not divulge here.  The story is told from Lisey's perspective as after a couple of years, her grief for her deceased husband reawakens.<br /><br />This is one of the finest depictions of married life and intimate relationships that I have ever read.  The shared language and references that no one outside the relationship would ever understand is one factor.  Another factor that makes this such a fine depiction is the gradual unfolding of both Scott and Lisey's understanding of each other.  Another aspect that creates such a full and rewarding depiction of such a relationship, is King's demonstration and understanding that both partners in a relationship, even though adult, bring every bit of the child they were into the relationship, and in this story, this aspect is perhaps the saddest whatsoever.<br /><br />King still utilizes his often used tactic of using the horror elements to more adequately convey the emotional trauma of abusive relationships, whether in family (consider the gradual slide back into alcoholism and family abuse in \\"The Shining\\"), school, (consider both \\"Carrie,\\" and \\"It\\"), as well as the confusion that family based abusive relationships can cause.<br /><br />At first, Scott's re-tellings of his childhood past seem jarring, due to a very, very childish manner of speaking which King chooses to render, however a reader does get used to it, and considering the age of the child (Scott), one can forgive that if it bothers them because of the sheer power of the story Scott Landon has to tell.  I'm not generally one to cry at books or movies, however the final pages that Scott left for his wife, depicting the worst of his abuse and what he had to do to save both his life and his father from himself, from the perspective of the horror element and of the child's and the reader's difficulty and confusion in reconciling his love for a generally loving, well-meaning, but not well-equipped father and a abusive demon who appears possessed by a weird, unknowable, and alien thing (I hate that word, \\"thing\\", but I'm not sure there are words to describe well, what \\"it\\" is), which seems a very apt image of the 180 shifts an abuser can make, did bring me to tears, for the lost and alone little boy who by his father's last, \\"possession\\" had no one to protect him, and who had to make a very difficult and adult action, and who has blamed himself ever since.<br /><br />I don't understand why there are so few reviews of this book on Amazon, and am hoping that they are plentiful on the paperback entry.  As well as everything else I have described, this book is one of Stephen King's most poetic, most powerful (well, for me, along with \\"It\\") and most beautiful.  This is a story where the place the author goes for stories is a real one, that the author can both transport people to and be trapped in.  That place being one filled with infinite beauties and horrors,and the place where Lisey most learns to understand her husband, and even, in the end, become him in a small way.<br /><br />This book does tend to run a little bit long (though given the length of this review, I probably shouldn't be throwing stones), and sorry Mr. King, I know you left an explanation for those who would offer this critique, but there are places where it could suitably have been pared down, however, given the book's extreme beauty and philosophy of language and relationships, I think that could be easily forgiven (and to be fair, I myself was so caught up in the story during the first read, that I didn't notice it until after a few reads through).<br /><br />I admit that the first time I read this book, when I finished, I was so reluctant to leave the world and the characters he creates, that I immediately re-read it.  However, after that, this book is one that is so harrowing, that I can only read it once in a very great while, but that does not diminish either its power or its beauty.<br /><br />I am sure that Stephen King somewhere along the way, read Tolkien's essay, \\"On Fairie Stories\\" and though this story swings between and creates a bridge between our modern world and a fairy world all its own in a way that Tolkien doesn't (though there are allusions to world war and to industrialism within Lord of the Ring's, all of it is set in a mythical reality) King truly and successfully transports the reader whether precocious older child (parents would be well served to read this first), or adult (whom Tolkien asserted were the most in need of \\"fairie\\" stories) to the land of fairie in such vivid detail that this reader was loathe to leave it.  That is the magic of fairie and fairie stories.  Once you leave them, and the land of fairie leaves you, you never know if the next time you pick up that book, whether it will still take you back there.  So far, for this reader, both Lord of the Rings, and Lisey's Story still transport me to that magical and mythical world.<br /><br />I try to state in my reviews, who would like this book and who wouldn't.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't.  I highly recommend that everyone wander down and drink from this, another of King's creations from that \\"myth and word pool where we all go down to drink.\\"on, and am hoping that they are plentiful on the paperback entry.

630469654X|2.0|\\"Ladyhawke\\" is one of those water cooler conversation movies.  It is always brought up as the film everyone has heard of, but rarely has been seen - and those that have seen it, worship the ground it steps on.  Recently, \\"Ladyhawke\\" came across my player, and the opportunity to view this romantic fantasy was presented.  Being an enormous fan of both \\"The Princess Bride\\", \\"Willow\\", and any of the reincarnations of \\"Robin Hood\\", I was eager to add another title to the cannon.  I wanted to be that guy that stood around the water cooler mentioning \\"Ladyhawke\\" to the utter confusion of my coworkers.  Alas, my dreams were not that of Navarre or Isabeau, instead they were shattered as soon as the 2+ hours were completed.  One can argue that this is a creative film; one could argue that the attraction between Hauer and Pfiffer was pure uncut chemistry, and one could argue that this is one of those forgotten classics that needs to be remembered.  Disappointingly, that is not my reaction to this Richard Donner helmed behemoth.  From a disastrous score (yep, jumping on that bandwagon) to cardboard acting to a underdeveloped plot, \\"Ladyhawke\\" failed to be anything more than just your average fantasy film.<br /><br />As the anticipation of angry faces on this review is realized, let me stress my points.  \\"Ladyhawke\\" had quite a bit of potential.  The idea was in place, the actors may have been able to handle their respective roles (at least Broderick could), and the director was the director of \\"Superman\\".  How could this project fail?  At the beginning, there are no problems.  Our introduction to Phillipe aka \\"the Mouse\\" felt genuine and unique.  His escape from prison gave us a deeper insight to his character, his abilities, and his child-like motives.  The opening scene felt like it was going to set the tone for the remainder of the film, and for the brief 15-minutes of Phillipe's escape, the level of enjoyment was up.  Then, we are full-throttled into the world of Navarre, and our dynamic changes.  This becomes less of a film about Phillipe, whom I was rooting for, but instead a substandard story about two star-crossed lovers that by magic cannot be together.  Not only does our dynamic change (less Phillipe more quiet stares and gruff Hauer), but our story devolves into whatever Donner feels like throwing in on that day of shooting.  Never are we introduced to magic within the world, but suddenly we are to believe that this mutation is plausible.  There is realization that we are focusing on these two particular individuals, but we have no control group to experience the day-to-day of this world.  Then, more intermediate characters are brought forward to build excitement, when honestly, the just build confusion.  Question arise like was Cezar (Alfred Molina!) necessary, was John Wood as evil as predicted as the Bishop (need more!), and where does Imperius fit within everything.  \\"Ladyhawke\\" felt like Donner wanted sweeping landscapes, star-crossed lovers, and an epic church battle, but cared nothing for what fell in between.<br /><br />With a lacking structure, we are forced to plop ourselves down and watch Hauer and Pfiffer carry this film - which is the bigger tragedy of this film because neither understand their roles not provide us with any definition.  Isabeau, the less developed of the two, begins with mere stares, being more mysterious then passionate, and then, as we get closer to the finale, Donner makes us question her love for Hauer - which undermines this entire film.  It makes us think that this is not eternal love, but merely a difficult circumstance.  Hauer, more muscle than mind, fights his way through every battle using a sword the size of Phillipe.  He is the most grounded of our group, and seems to be fighting more for their love than Pfiffer, but one needs to question when this epic battle didn't happen earlier.  Why was Phillipe needed to spark this journey?  If the love was that powerful, wouldn't Hauer have triedto meet with Imperius prior, fought the Bishop himself, and perhaps won his love himself?  This piece just didn't fit - their characters wanted it, but why couldn't they do it?<br /><br />Finally, the music is horrible.  Yes, the 80s were a time of synthesizers and imagination, but it just didn't fit with this genre of film.  No matter how you put it, the music ruins the scenes in which we feel like the guards are going to break out in dance or have huge sunglasses.  Donner failed in the world of sound for this film, and merely for that - I can see why \\"Ladyhawke\\" hasn't taken off further.<br /><br />FILM:  This film was flimsy.  The story wasn't structurally sound, the support (aka the actors) didn't know who their characters were, and the only shine in this darkened tunnel was Matthew Broderick, who charmed his way out of every predicament possible.  This is tough film to rewatch and even a tougher challenge to enjoy.<br /><br />VISUAL:  The special effects were pure 80s, one cannot fault highly for that.  Yet this transfer was horrible.  It was like a VHS copy onto DVD.  Warner has not updated this disc since DVDs were first introduced, and that is sad.<br /><br />SOUND:  One must applaud the genius who decided that synthesizers were a key element to period fantasy films.  I have never heard anything quite like this before, and I don't think I will again.  \\"Ladyhawke\\" is ruined, no matter what you say, due to the sound chosen to be our \\"Hero's March\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:  Staying true to the idea that nothing has changed since DVDs were first introduced, the extras contained are bios of the actors (done in page format - not video), a diary of some of the key scenes (again page format), suggestions of other films, and finally, the quintessential trailer.  Nothing else.  I am not an audio commentary snob, but Donner's words - even Hauer's gruff voice would have added to this disc immensely.<br /><br />Overall, not impressed.  I began this film with hopes to discover a new fantasy to introduce to friends and be that guy around the water cooler.  \\"Ladyhawke\\" is not that film.  I believe it has been unjustly pushed into a cult category due to the popularity of its actors and possibly director.  The acting is below par, the soundtrack is hilarious, and the story is as ramshackled as this disc.  It is not a film to talk about, not a film to watch, nor a film to enjoy.  This was a disappointment - I can applaud Matthew Broderick for not forcing me to throw the disc out after the first hour, but other than that it failed.  \\"Ladyhawke\\" should be left in the darkened backlist of the local video store for years to come, only to be seen by some unsuspecting person hoping for the same quest I envisioned, but being disgusted again and again and again.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****Imperius prior, fought the Bishop himself, and perhaps won his love himself?

B002FRNCG0|4.0|I think that the first 2 songs are the weakest on the album. That's not to say they're bad songs but they sound like the band took everything they liked from Riot! and mixed it up with some new ideas. Not that this hasn't been done before but it really doesn't work here. I can see why \\"Ignorance\\" was chosen as a single from a commercial perspective because it's definitely riding on the strengths from Riot!. However, Haley's phrasing during the song can get annoying.    It gets better from here. Both Playing God and Brick by Boring Brick are catchy and have hooks you can sink your teeth into. It's almost comparable to a live act that needs the first couple of songs to warm up.  When Turn It Off starts it brings back the Paramore we know. The band kicks in and rocks with nice layers of guitar and solid drumming and the vocals are taken up a notch.    The Only Exception is a very nice song with acoustic guitars and a smooth bass. Haley shows us where she can go with her emotional voice and a nod to Edie Brikell on the chorus. Great production on this track.    Feeling Sorry and Looking Up bring us back to what's becoming the classic Paramore rock sound. Solid guitars and bass with Zac providing some nice flair on the skins. I will say that Zac sounds looser and faster on this record and he has raised the bar for the band and those involved with them. For the most part everyone seems to be keeping up and that can't be an easy task since this boys talent growth rate seems to be on hyper drive.    The A capella parts of Where The Lines Overlap provide Haley a chance to sing with a cry and a strain in her voice. Misguided Ghosts is an acoustic number that could have been done by Lisa Loeb. We hear another vocal style that's clear, clean and leads the song. This is what a band that's working together sounds like.    All I Wanted is similar to the previous song with a leading vocal. The bass has a nice reverb and sustain to it all the way through. Haley really shows her potential at about 2:44 when she raises the pitch at the end of the word \\"You\\" during the A capella chorus. Powerful stuff.    It's unfair to compare this disc to Riot! in most respects because Riot! is such a monster and Brand New Eyes does stand on its own. Brand New Eyes does have better production. The bass mix and guitar/drum mix are well balanced all the way through. With the exception of the first 2 songs, the writing has become better. Brand New Eyes is a very good follow up to Riot!, thankfully more of it's companion than a \\"Part 2\\". Riot! got our attention and Brand New Eyes shows us what they can do.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you are a real Jane Austen fan, then you owe it to yourself to buy this version of Pride & Prejudice.  To date, this is BY FAR the best version I have ever seen!!  The only bad thing about it is....it ends!!  Ohhh, to just get a glimpse of Mr + Mrs Darcy's life after they marry -- why can't someone make a great sequel to this!!?  Oh well, I guess I'll just have to watch this one again (and again!) =0)
B00007LTIA|5.0|The most ambitious concept album Yes ever tackled and the result is nothing short of a life changing experience. The album is arranged as 4 movements (20+ minutes each) each with their own spectacular texture, color, and climaxes. The musicianship, writing, and beauty of this is just unbelievable. Although I most experienced this album many years ago it remains in my top 5 of all time. 5 stars.
B000005HFH|4.0|I first heard Chet singing in a documentary about him, got entranced by his voice and phrasing and decided to buy this cd. I got what I wanted, even a bit too much. To my taste the cd is overloaded with sad ballads, so that by the time you hear the last song the magic of Chet's voice starts to dissipate into the feeling of utter coolness and chagrin, so you just want to get up and change the track. But still all the favorites are there, they just need to be taken one by one,that would make them sound so much more special and unique.   So, I would advise listening to this cd in a shuttle mode with some of other Chet's lighter tunes.

1416594787|5.0|In a way I'm glad Prof. Richard Dawkins wrote this book. So far I had a fairly rudimentary knowledge of evolution, and this helped me understand a bit more about it. But in a way I'm sad that books like these have to be written , not to inform or educate, but to refute the ignorant, the stupid or the dishonest(Like someone has said after reading this book they can no longer call themselves ignorant).  Prof. Dawkins has a lucid writing style, and when it comes to explaining science , I feel that he is only second to Carl Sagan. There is also the sense of sincerity and wonder about science that comes through in the writing, that makes anyone who has even a little of bit of curiosity, join Prof Dawkins on his journeys and explanations. Prof Dawkins manages to keep your interest even when he is discussing elaborate and intricate material like Richard Lenski's grand experiment. I read this section of the book on the train on the way home and I couldn't stop reading inspite of Prof Dawkins' warning to not read this at the end of a busy day.  The book itself covers a wide range of the evidence of evolution and discusses the various Creationist/Intelligent Design ploys and their fallacies, and Prof Dawkins deals with these issues appropriately(Warning if you are a creationist , it isn't pretty) . The book is full of witty anecdotes and I couldn't stop laughing at J.B.S. Haldane's 'You did it yourself and it only took you 9 months'. Professor Dawkins makes a comprehensive case for the various independent streams of evidence we have for evolution and the way that each one of them could have been falsified (take that Ann Coulter).   For those who are scared away by Prof Dawkins' atheism, this book does not touch on the subject (except in the preface) and even if you are , there are other books about evolution that you could and should read.  If you discount evolution because of your religion, then you should remember Carl Sagan's words  'How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, \\"This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant. God must be even greater than we dreamed\\"? Instead they say, \\"No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.'   After reading through this book I'm curious enough to read other books on evolution, on a couple of that interest me, this book has stoked my curiosity on the subject, and I'm sure that for Prof Dawkins, who is also an educator an who takes his teaching seriously , that is high praise.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|Sometime in the 15th century, snow falls outside a solid, achingly tall castle.  Outside in the sterling clear cold, sleety wind blows across sunlight rapidly failing in the oncoming dusk.  An older Celtic troubador stands before a high, weathered wooden door.<br /><br />He knocks, the sound reverberating into a cavernous space within.  The door opens and a young man in a dark, roughly woven servant's cloak bids the troubador enter.<br /><br />The room beyond, lit by spinning firelight, soars into dark rafters.  The troubador walks to the center of the room, and begins to play.<br /><br />His voice is like the instruments he carries:  what is worn away by the years is replenished in burnished gleams and silken reams of thready notes.<br /><br />But, this isn't any ordinary troubador:  imps of various sorts appear magically, with trumpets, instruments from the far east, and an angelic chorus or two.  They dance in rhythms of gypsy caravans, the plainsongs of the people, and the stately glory of her majesty's churches.<br /><br />Outside, the wind begins to quicken and the light slinks away as the shadows start to lengthen and move.  The walls of the castle draw closer, huddling against the solidifying dark.<br /><br />The concert within continues with ghostly accompaniment on violins and glass clavichords.  The clavichord is replaced by a band of red velvet clad Spanish guitarists.  Finally, some reincarnation of Cab Calloway begins to conduct an orchestra in the background. The troubador sings his breathy last song as dawn begins anew.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I'm a vinyl nut - I still listen to CDs but I find vinyl to be more satisfying in general. But this release has to be one of the best CD transfers I've heard in a long while. The original album on vinyl is outstanding, but this is so close that's it's hard to pick a winner. The drums on \\"Take Five\\" just jump out at you, and the sax sounds wonderful.    The live show is worthwhile, and I really enjoyed the Brubeck interview. Neat stuff.    I recommend this without reservations, even if you're a vinyl snob. :)
B0029O08WA|4.0|Initially, I found this a little too moody for me, but I have to say, it's completely grown on me. It's that rare kind of offbeat CD that just continues to sound better and better the more you play it... especially the later and later at night that you listen to it ... I absolutely love Satellite Heart, Monsters, I Belong To You, White Demon, Roslyn, No Sound But The Wind, Slow Life, I mean, what's not to like here? I don't see any point comparing this to the Twilight soundtrack. I loved that soundtrack for completely different reasons, but this one for New Moon stands on its own. It makes me feel like I'm floating in space... Kind of a very downbeat, mellow Major Tom/David Bowie kind of vibe on a couple of these songs... I think I hear him in a couple of the melodies... one or two of the voices...  Or am I crazy??

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Like MJ fans across the world at Midnight I was at the IMAX theater to see the premier of THIS IS IT.  I was not disappointed - of course there was no way I could be.  This was not a documentary, it was clips from the rehearsals for what promised to be the best MJ concert yet.  From the film clips presented it was on track to fulfill the promise.  Sadly, it was not to be.  I, as were my fellow moviegoers, was in the cross hairs of jubilation and sadness. We seemed to not know whether we wanted to treat the experience as a concert (which in many ways it was) and sing along or a memorial.  In that torn state I decided to just enjoy the moment.  And I look forward to enjoying it once again when I have my personal copy of the last rehearsal clips.      My husband viewed the movie in the Middle East where he said the packed theater audience erupted in spontaneous applause throughout the movie.  Michael Jackson was well loved.    This presentation gives a glimpse of the person that was Michael Jackson. Talented, compassionate, kind, gentle, caring, professional, human.  He is sorely missed.  I am grateful for the memories.    May he rest in eternal peace...  God's Peace.
B00007GZR5|4.0|First and foremost, if you are interested in Samkhya Philosophy / Yogic self-cultivation and death and dying, this film was pretty much made for you.  If not, you may be disappointed.  Please do a modicum of research on this topic before watching as it will make the entire premise of the film more understandable.  For example, you'll notice that no one knows who or what God is at this stage, which just follows suit with the philosophy.  Divine interaction in the afterlife occurs more intimately at the karana and parusha realms.  I my opinion, this film follows the philosophy to a T, so in this sense I think the movie is spot on.  I get the feeling that many reviewed this move projecting values upon it that were never there in the first place.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this movie is that the casting is absolutely horrible.  I mean just awful!  To boot, the writing seemed just sorta tossed together.  It's as if they had this great idea and nifty special effects, but then just figured that if they got a big name star, the rest would just take care of itself.  Well, it didn't.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays a static, overly impulsive and stubborn man who seems to spout useless clich&eacute;s whenever given the chance.  His daughter is pretty much stoic and his son seems a bit out of his league.  The only believable character is his wife.  As I'm not a big fan of Cuba Gooding jr. I don't feel my commentary on his lack-luster and spastic performance is very meaningful.<br /><br />Without getting too much into the plot, how the after life functions seems right on.  In the film, Williams is met by a spirit guide, allowed to make his peace with this life and then move on to the astral dimension where imagination and creativity reign.  As we find out, he's not very good at it at first.  Also, the view on personal hell is spot on in my book too.  Some of the more broad metaphysical assumption seem a little contrived, like the whole needing a guide to find someone, seemed a little forced, but it added to the plot a bit.<br /><br />I'll give this film a four stars as I feel that it followed its own philosophy quite well and because I feel it to be good when alternative (pronounced, \\"non-Christian\\") views of the afterlife are made accessible to the public.  I'm still on the fence about giving it three due to the terrible acting and script, but the visual beauty of some scenes seals the deal at four.it added to the plot a bit.

1410409589|5.0|I love this whole young adult, fantasy genre. I am a big Twilight fan, but I must admit, this series was much better than the Twilight saga. There is some romance, but it also has a lot more action, which I feel Twilight was lacking. My boyfriend even enjoyed these books! This series was also written in 3rd person point of view......wonderful for developing more characters. Give this series a try: check it out at the library or buy for yourself. I bought the whole series. I hope Cassandra Clare writes some more YA books like this.   Also, try Cynthia Leitich Smith for other YA books along the same line (titles: Tantalize and Eternal - VERY easy reading). My next series will be Charlaine Harris (True Blood) and The Vampire Diaries.

B002HWUU2C|4.0|Just got this album and I love it.  If you liked the first album you'll like this one.  I like this album even more than the first.  It sounds a bit more developed.  Just be careful if you decide to buy the delux version because the live cd only has fourteen songs not twenty.  Feelin a little ripped off - I'm taking off a star.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This is a review of the movie, don't have the CDs...yet.    Buried within the previews before the movie started was a plug for some musician babe named Orianthi. The Girl leaned over to me and said, \\"I've never heard of her.\\" I hadn't either.    Well, we have now. She is a white-hot guitarist featured on the new documentary of Michael Jackson's rehearsals for the ill-scheduled This Is It shows that the world would have been seen in England, starting this past July.    This Is It is a love letter to Michael Jackson's fans, which, of course inhabit most of the planet. And it is fascinating. About fifteen minutes into it, I realized I was watching MJ being a human being, meticulously working on every detail of his last live appearances (yeah right).    Filmed in a documentary format and slightly grainy , you feel as if you're seeing something forbidden, something that wouldn't have remained buried in a box in somebody's archive if it hadn't been for Michael's demise (and financial straits).    During the press conference, part of which if shown at the beginning, Michael says, \\"I'm going to be doing all the songs my fans know and want.\\" And boy do they. As expected, the set list draws heavily from Bad, Dangerous and especially Thriller. Probably the most interesting part of the set would have been the Jackson Five numbers, the rehearsals for which show a seventies big-round lettered background and airy pop numbers.    As for Michael's performance...well, the song rehearsals are just amazing. Between the songs, as it shows Michael's hard work and perfectionism is plain interesting. We get to see Michael as a human being, the guy just like us that we've known he used to be, and that we've always hoped was still there, behind all the weirdness.    It's a cliche to say that the best musicians torture themselves and everyone around them to replicate the precise sounds they hear inside of their heads. However, were Michael Jackson stands apart from all other musicians is thathe can replicate any of the sounds he wants to hear with his mouth. He sings a high falsetto for Orianthi to play as he admonishes, \\"This is your time to shine!\\" He keeps at her until she tortures her guitar strings to wring out the exact note.    Another time on the terrifically-rearranged intro to The Way You Make Me Feel, he tells his musical director to slow down the tempo, spelling it out for him, \\"Do it like you're getting out of bed.\\" Then, when the same guy comes into the melody of the same song, Michael wants him to hold the pause longer, saying, \\"Let is simmer. Just let it simmer.\\"    The definition of a self-actualized person is a person so secure in themselves that they could walk into a black tie event wearing tennis shoes and not notice they were dressed inappropriately. Some of MJ's attire during these rehearsals pushes that point. Mostly he's wearing tight red pants and different sequined ones. One of his outfit looks like something straight out of the movie Beetlejuice, with wide white lapels and too-pointy shoulders. Other costumes replicate the looks we've come to know from the videos, a red jacket for Thriller, the yellow zoot suit for Smooth Criminal. Michael knows how important dress is to the overall package as the rehearsal of Beat It ends with him throwing down the red jacket he'll be wearing and pretending to stomp it out, telling everyone, \\"It's too hot, too hot to handle.\\"    Could he have made it through the grueling schedule of fifty shows? I doubt it. Even viewing the footage, which certainly was the most flattering of what was shot, it is apparent that we are watching a sick man. Next to Michael, all of the dancers and even razor-thin backup singers look plump. His health also appears to show up in his voice, which, even enhanced and amplified, a lot of times sounds thin. It's obvious that some of the songs were lip-synched. At one point Michael evidently feels the need to rationalize the state of his voice, repeating, \\"I've got to conserve my throat.\\"    I think Micheal would have played as many shows as he could handle, maybe half of 'em, then called off the tour due to health reasons, which over the years has always seemed to be his m.o. when things were getting too intense. I'm sure tickets would have been refunded, then perhaps another five date rescheduled, \\"The Last of the Last,\\" with tickets for double the price of the original. Then another five, until all fifty dates were done. I think Michael would have pulled every dollar out of those shows, and everyone would have known what he was doing...but would have paid the prices anyway, and when the smoke cleared we'd all have realized that, once again, the King of Pop played us again...but we wouldn't have cared.    Toward the end things do get a bit preachy, as a terrific movie plays before, during and after a song dedicated to the environment. Michael even says something about \\"The world is sick, it's got a fever, and this is our last chance to heal it,\\" then says something about only having four years to save it. Oh well, he seems absolutely and utterly sincere, but once again, we're another witnessing yet celebrity telling us about the earth's fate while oblivious to their own mindlessly wasteful personal consumption.    Toward the end, we see Michael and his entourage in a scene that we somehow knew they had. They are all in a circle and Michael is giving them a pump up talk. He tells them not to be nervous and to have fun. Then he articulates a distilled wisdom that we've always known was the key to why Michael Jackson is so great. He says, \\"People want escapism. Go out there and show them your talent.\\"     In spite of all all the physical changes MJ's made to himself, there are moments where he's singing and the camera angle is just right, when you can see the little boy that was singing onstage with his brothers, the kid who's surprised and delighted us all for all of these years.    For two hours, This Is It delivers it's messagenon-stop: Michael Jackson was brilliant. And that the King of Pop was also the King of entertainment, whether it was dance, music video, Broadway-style production numbers, blues, rock and gospel.     And now he's gone.

0375714839|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is a graphic novel, originally published in four parts in France. It formed the basis for an animated film that was first released in 2007. It won the Jury Prize at that year's Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated at the Oscars for Best Animated Feature. Rather unusually for a graphic novel, it tells the story of Satrapi's own life.<br /><br />Marji was an ordinary 10-year old when the Revolution took place in 1979. She was very religious, and desperately wanted to be the last prophet...but she also idolized Bruce Lee and occasionally pretended to be Che Guevara. Naturally, she understood little of the \\"adult world\\" - Marji liked the Shah, and believed her teachers when they said he'd been appointed by God. Her parents, with good reason, detested the Shah and soon explained the truth to her. The current Shah inherited his position from his father - who, in turn, had been appointed by the British, rather than God. Furthermore, her Grandfather (a prince, no less) and her Uncle Anoosh had been imprisoned by one Shah or another and both had been devoted Communists - viewed by both Shahs as something evil. Both Marji's parents had been involved in protests against the Shah's regime, though they'd managed to stay out of prison.<br /><br />With the fall of the Shah, life is - for a short spell - like a dream. Old family friends - like Moshen and Siamak, who had been routinely tortured - and Marji's Uncle Anoosh are released from prison. Like Marji's parents, both are hopeful of a better society. Marji had known nothing of her Uncle before his release from prison but, before long, the pair are devoted to each other. Unfortunately, their hopes prove unfounded. Islamic Fundamentalists win the following elections, and society becomes even more oppressive. Many of the Shah's former enemies - including Anoosh - are hunted down and returned to prison. Moshen, meanwhile, is found dead in his bath...though since only his head was underwater, it was obvious he was murdered. Although some (like Siamak) flee, Marji and her family stay put. War with Iraq sees the authorities calling for martyrs, with our young heroine becoming increasingly disillusioned. As time goes on, though, it becomes increasingly obvious that Marji won't be able to say nothing and keep her head down. As a result, her parents decide to send her to Austria to continue her education. While the move solves some problems, it opens the door to many more...and for many years, leaves Marji trapped between two worlds and unsure where she belongs.<br /><br />Being a graphic novel, it's not your typical autobiography. There is a brief introduction - using standard prose rather than pictures - where Satrapi tries to explain her reasons for writing this book. Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, she says, Iran \\"has been discussed mostly connection with fundamentalism, fanaticism and terrorism. As an Iranian who has lived more than half my life in Iran I know that this image is far from the truth.\\" Marji proved to be a very likeable character, someone you wanted to see things go right for...though somehow you knew things wouldn't be easy. She and her family did have a tricky life in Iran. Her difficulties with social classes, religious regimes, wars and rivalries set her apart- and the suffering of her family, friends and neighbours under two repressive regimes shouldn't be glossed over. (These regimes weren't entirely \\"their\\" fault either - there was a certain amount of sneaky Western interference). Her life in Austria - a democratic, western country - wasn't pleasant either. There, she was always the outsider, someone set apart - with things sometimes descending to blatant racism. Nevertheless, it's a book that's definitely recommended.
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|It's cool it has a slightly different name! It's still the fabulous Harry Potter movie though!
1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins amazes once again. In 'The Greatest Show On Earth', evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins lays out the evidence for evolution, and shows how creationist arguments are nonsense. The book is easy to read, provides a lot of information, and is quite entertaining. As always, Dawkins conveys science in a fun and interesting way.    I would say this book is intended for people who don't know anything about evolution or know some things, but want to know more. Of course this book will not win over hardcore creationists, which is sad since they are missing out on a beautiful theory and are rejecting evidence.    This book has NOTHING to do with atheism and/or religion. The only semi-religious thing in the book is when he compares evolutionary acceptance among western nations, and concludes (and data agrees) that the most religious nations tend to reject evolution.    I would also recommend:  'Why Evolution Is True' by Jerry Coyne  'Your Inner Fish' by Neil Shubin

0470477237|5.0|[...].  Socialnomics should be a must-have reference tool and read for any person interested in where we as a society and people are headed.  The book touches on business, marketing, life, communication and the list goes on.      Qualman does an excellent job at providing real-life scenarios and examples of the factual information he is providing.  This book isn't a few hundred pages of pure commentary and no research, it's an excellent balance of both.    This book can be especially helpful for the person who perhaps doesn't quite understand or can't get the full grasp of what social media is or what socialnomics refers to.  It's not too basic and yet not overly advanced and packed full of tech-jargon.  If you're in any way related to the marketing field, take the time to read this book - if you think you already know everything you need to know for your business and marketing technique...you're wrong and this book will be just the launchpad of a series of eye-opening moments.    In all seriousness, this book was well worth the small investment and it will be very helpful in the road ahead!
0060254920|5.0|This is definitely in the top ten of all time greatest children's picture books. We all have had that place of imagination as a child, where we go \\"where the wild things are\\". The drawings are so incredibly original and memorable. Even after so many years, the effect of the book to all children does not diminish one bit. We all, boys and girls alike, can relate to the main character Max's adventure, as he goes to explore the \\"other side\\" and quickly declares himself king. If you watch enough movies, read enough stories, you will somehow always return to the universal essence of this book, that of innocence, risk, escapism and the appreciation of your loved ones.<br /><br />[...]
B002JIOOB2|5.0|The L Word series is about the lives, loves and friendships of a group of lesbians living in Los Angeles. The casting is superb:  Jennifer Beals  (Bette), Erin Daniels (Dana), Leisha Hailey  (Alice),  Laurel Holloman  (Tina),  Mia Kirshner  (Jenny Schecter),  Katherine Moennig  (Shane),  Pam Grier  (Kit),  Rachel Shelley (Helena)  and Daniela Sea  (Max),  only to name a few.  In addition, there are guest appearances by Cybill Shepherd, Gloria Steinem, Ossie Davis, Billie Jean King and Snoop Dog.  Every element in the series is first class: the photography, scenery, costumes and story lines.  The music is among the best I've heard in any series.  I never realized there were so many talented women artists. Plus there are performances by many well known artists, including Heart.  The series deals with a number of serious gay issues:  coming out, gay adoption & parenting, coming out to parents, gays in the military and trangendering from female to male.  Plus it puts a lesbian perspective on issues common to us all:  love, relationships, monogamy, promiscuity, breast cancer and job discrimination. It includes women from all age groups: from their early twenties to their mid-fifties. I was pretty naive about transgenders and was quite touched by Max's struggles as she/he goes through the transition process.  Dana's struggle with breast cancer is absolutely heart wrenching.  When Phyllis (Cybill Shepherd) comes out as a lesbian after twenty years of marriage the story is both touching and hilarious. There is a lighter side: The Gay Pride Parade,  The Lesbian, Gay Bisexual, Transgender festivities at the 11th Annual Women's Event in New York and when the gang goes on an Olivia Cruise it made me want to immediately jump on the boat and ride away into lesbian heaven.  The show does not portray your typical butch-femme stereotypes.  Instead you have gorgeous lesbians dressed in exquisite clothes.  The lingerie only adds to the sexiness.  The love scenes are not just hot, theyare sizzling.  Most lesbian love scenes are done by straight women and appear  fake and sometimes look downright painful.  Not here!  The kissing, touching and simulated sex are absolute erotic.  Shane, who is known for her promiscuity, steams up the screen with her seduction of an array of women.  The only disappointment is the ending of the series.  It leaves more questions than answers.  Who really killed Jenny Schecter?  It could be that way because they are leaving the series open to a sequel.  The cost of the series may seem expensive, but consider that you are getting a total of 81 episodes.   Plus each season includes a number of bonus features.  This is a series you will watch over and over and is well worth the money.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If you like whining chick rock, like the new Staind and Daughtry, you'll love this album. If you like Linkin Park, don't pick up this Linkin Park CD (odd sounding eh?). WTF LP! My only hope for your 4th CD is that the song \\"New Divide\\" is the LP I've grown to love. If you're headed back in that \\"rock\\" direction let me know, otherwise I'm done with you.
B002NACY2M|5.0|This is what winter would sound like - stark, still, intimate, crisp and a bit chilly. Sting dusts off  old Celtic ballads and bathes them in new light-- plus he revisits some of his own music from the last decades and I believe there are a couple of new songs.  This collection of music echos voices from many centuries ago, but maintains a fresh sound by reinvention.  Sting's voice is rich and melodic; the arrangements and instruments are emotional and complex.  Some of the songs (they are really too beautiful to be merely \\"songs,\\" though) are nearly a cappella, with instruments simply coaxing forth mood. Some of the music is somber, some joyful -- all of it inspiring.     While this is certainly suitable for \\"the Holidays,\\" the music on this cd is really meant to be more-- evoke a feeling of what winter can be: reflective, still, somber, a time to prepare for renewal. Some fans may be turned off by the simply pure, almost raw interpretations -- this does not sound like it has been over wrought with sound technicians and studio tricks -- no this is much more wonderful.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This is a quality CD just like all the stuff they come out with. I liked every song but 4 & 7 was too soft for me.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This Is It shows Michael was in great shape and knew what he wanted for this show- a show that was going to be unlike anything before it. With the rehearsals being this good it is clear just how amazing these concerts were going to be. Not only was his singing and dancing the way we all know and were ready to see but the extras he put into the show are also pure Michael- scientists working on developing things for him to wear, 3D Thriller and everything else- we missed out on what could have been the greatest comeback of all time but at least we have this to give us an idea of what could have been.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I was exetremly excited when I heard this cd was coming out and after getting thtis cd, it didn't fail to impress me .  every songs was powerful, mature and beautiful, it was listening to art being produced.  It has all the elements of a Breaking Benjamin album but it has a new edge.  I could listening to this CD straight throught and listening to it again and again.  Best song.... Give me a sign, strong, beautiful amazing song , taking the spirit of \\"Sooner or Later\\"  I will not Bow, powerful, hard hitting , amazing riffs  Lights Out... what can I say? one of my favorite songs.    For anyone who loves Breaking Benjamin needs to listen to this CD, end of story.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|Had this been live like I had hoped I would have gotten that right away. I could not believe that they just took the original songs and put them on the CD, this was very disappointing. My guess is that there is talking in some of the songs and thought people wouldn't have wanted that but I could care less--- let them talk, there isn't much on the songs and would have still had Michael singing which is the important part.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|You just can't take \\"Orphan\\" too seriously. From the lengthy (and \\"bloody\\") opening sequence to the jaw-dropping finale, the story of this \\"bad seed\\" horror film directed Jaume Collet-Serra (remake version of \\"House of Wax\\") remains preposterous. That doesn't mean \\"Orphan\\" is not worth watching, however. The film is fairly entertaining as long as you can ignore the obvious plot holes, graphic violence and, well, the \\"twist\\" that will leave most viewers speechless.      Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is a 9-year-old orphaned Russian girl. Sociable and charming, Esther is adopted by John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) and his wife Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) who has lost her baby recently. At first everything goes well and John and Kate are both very happy until one day Kate starts to feel that something is not quite right about Esther, a girl with a serene smile.    \\"Orphan\\" is largely well-acted (Isabelle Fuhrman as enigmatic Esther is quite impressive), but it takes too much time for the film to get things moving. Also, several episodes make the characters look very stupid - if someone claims that his child, severely wounded, is \\"pushed\\" by my child, I would take the matter much seriously than the Colemans.     But what is most disappointing is that Jaume Collet-Serra has missed so many chances to make the film a better thriller. There is a scene where Esther shows her sexual side, but that aspect of the storyline is not fully explored. John and Kate Coleman have two children, 12-year-old Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and very adorable Max (Aryana Engineer), but their presence in the story as unprotected family member doesn't really enhance the suspense. Maybe I am wrong, but somehow the Spanish-born director Jaume Collet-Serra is forced to pull punches where he knows he shouldn't.

0143038419|5.0|Outside of two-stepping with the humor, which pain tells with more fervor and flavor than... let's say, the ego, I don't think I've ever read of a soul as lost explain itself so clearly and thoroughly. And I'm speaking of Liz's soul actually speaking; not her, the facet that makes this work most intriguing.<br /><br />The analogies and comparisons suspended around gourmet foods, a romantic language, Gurus, beautiful Felipe's and such kept me so vigilant hoping the conflict within Liz would settle that I, too, strayed off the beaten path. For some reason, and I realize the journey was prompted in part by learning Italian, but I kept going back to the clip of how some living abroad see `Americans'... as serious workaholics, for one. I may have interpreted this wrong, but in this land of liberty, America hosts a great diversity of cultures in varying places not so uptight about sex or sexuality, and where `chilling' is the predominant way of life. In other words, the one place I might look for my soul is by sojourning my way around my country first. (Not City or State, but Country.)<br /><br />Certainly still, Eat, Love, Pray is a very passionate read where just as I, `always believe', the best writers experience and bring forth the deepest pain in the greatest doses of humor.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|Here's hoping that director Kerry Conran has not fallen under the curse of studio execs who dispatched more than one gifted novice with the words, \\"You'll never work in this town again!\\" Sky Captain is a great romantic adventure movie, heavy on the scifi and the parallel reality, made all the more astounding because of post-production craft. It is obvious that the movie came together after the actors went home, but it is almost as if you are drawn into this drawn-in world and get to spend some quality time there. As a special treat, the good witch and Lawrence Olivier make cameo appearances. The true seeker will first want to see the 1936 blockbuster, Things to Come.

This movie is funny, heartwarming, entertaining and teaches young people values.  We have watched it several times, thoroughly enjoying it each time.  It encompasses singing, dancing, family, a teen boy/girl relationship, devoted father/daughter interaction, family, friends and more.  A pure delight.
0743298039|2.0|Pros: Setterfield's character Miss Winter refers to herself as a subplot in her own story. I think this is accomplished both thematically and through clever story telling. Miss Winter is a writer who twists fairy tales making them more bizarre or gruesome than the original. In a similar parallel, Thirteenth Tale follows a like thematic format with hints of various well known fairy tales woven with familiar classics such as Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights which evoke a relation between scenic imagery and the psychology of the characters. Although not directly referred to, I also thought the story mirrored another great classic, 'Great Expectations,' and found this interesting. However, I do not think the reader has to be acquainted with these classics to enjoy the story, but it is a bonus.<br /><br />Cons: There is so much going on in this novel, with subplots, thematic references and characters lives that I think it loses some of its strength. The author intends for the reader to be keep in the dark, but at times I felt wrongfully mislead in deceptive directions and got lost or found myself asking 'so what?' Also, there is a lot of retelling that occurs, which is especially annoying in the introduction of Hester's diary. Towards the end, more attention is given to Shadow the cat than to Charlie who we later find out is a lead character in creating this horrid tale of circumstance. The ending quickens, which is a relief from the lull in the middle, but I got the feeling the author did not want or know how to end with the natural conclusion. Instead, we are given a few more chapters of after thought. We are told this is done because readers often wonder what happened in the not so happily ever after. However, it's too neatly wrapped up and I think discredits all the effort the author originally made and the journey we went on in the first place. It felt more like a summary than an ending.
B000A1GXTQ|1.0|The 39 Steps is one of my favorite Hitchcock films!  The story, the action, the locations   All great stuff from the master of suspense!  Too bad the DVD wont play.  I returned it  for another copy, now the new copy will not play the last 20 minutes.  Time to try another vendor.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|For any U2 fan that grew up with this album, get this box set! These are how releases should be released. First, you get a remastered CD, plus a bonus CD of various extra available and unavailable material. There is a DVD with footage of Live Aid and the Amnnesty International concerts. Cardboard photo prints of the band back in the day that are great. And, a hardcover booklet with writings from Eno, Lanois, Edge etc. This is very well put together by everyone involved.      The Unforgettable Fire itself to me represents a brief experimental phase for the band. The youthful, militant and angry side of U2 on the War tour was ending, and the introspective, gospel and country influences of the Joshua Tree were yet to take place. In the middle, is the Unforgettable Fire. The bonus CD selections really show many different directions that U2 were trying in the studio. There are even two alternate versions of one of my favorite songs \\"Wire\\" on there that are quite good. In the booklet, The Edge goes over each song and gives some explanations about the origins and such. It is great to here everyone share their memories like that, and give some behind the scenes stuff.       I've tried to find a negative about this set. The only thing that may be a bit \\"bad\\" is on the remastered CD. The vocals may have been enhanced a little too much. If you crank the CD up when Bono sings any words with an \\"S\\" in it, there is a bit of shrieking in the speakers. But, that is not really a big concern, and should not be a deterrent in buying the set. The Unforgettable Fire has always been a big sentimental favorite for me, and anyone would be really hard pressed to find a better example than this box set. Enjoy, Paul.
0307266303|5.0|I loved this book.  Read it so fast since I couldn't bare to put it down.  It created a whole new enthusiasm for the exercise of running which to most people seems boring. This was a wonderful, exciting and educational read.  I had never heard of the tarahumara indians and was fascinated hearing about their culture of running and healthy eating.  The author mentioned them using chia seeds in a drink to sustain energy on extra long runs, that caused me to look further at this product and ended up buying these seeds also to try since I am concerned about keeping healthy at age 48 and I do run myself still.  For those who like to exercise and have an interest in keeping vibrant and educated about our bodies and other cultures, this is a good read.  If you don't like to exercise you may not find it as interesting.  It was well written, it had funny moments along with good points to consider for future eating habits and style of running.
0201633612|4.0|Design Patterns set out to identify the some of the most commonly used patterns and name them, so that they can be discussed easily.  It does precisely that, and quite well.  As long as you remember that it is not meant to be the definitive description of any patterns, and that variations and combinations on the patterns described are not only allowed but encouraged, it is a good reference.  I would recommend that anyone interested in object-oriented design at least skim it, if for no other reason than to extract the vocabulary it introduced.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|This being the first season, a few episodes are kinda 'meh'. But even the legendary Batman: The Animated Series was that way. As it went on, The Clone Wars became darker, grittier, and an all out joy to watch!     Any Star Wars fan should give this show a chance! Season 2 on now and it has been amazing so far.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|So, all these years later, we, meaning those of us who remember those days and those LP's, are blessed with the release of The Beatles Mono Set Remastered! To be honest, I always thought that The Beatles were always part of my music loving past. I still loved the band, but I had moved on to so many other artists. So I didn't think much of it when these box sets were being released. I already have everything, and I've bought everything ten times over, I don't need any more Beatles. Then I read up on the box sets and the mono set took on a \\"must have\\" desire. And low and behold....they were all sold out. Man, did I pout. So I started picking up the stereo mixes individually and with a heavy heart, placed an order for the mono set that I thought would never be filled.<br /><br />The box set is here, in my home. I patiently went through each album, slowly, looking at the beautiful replicas of each of the original album covers, reading the original text, looking at the pictures of the band on the front and back of the album covers, like I did when I was a young boy. Remembering a time that was special to me.<br /><br />One by one I played each remastered album and listened to mixes I have not heard in ages. I caught myself stomping my feet, singing along, holding my hands close to my chest, listening intently, and a few times, I wiped away the tears.<br /><br />The music is beautiful, exciting, happy, adventurous, brilliant. Each album shows the growth of the band, year by year. As a boy, I was witnessing the band change before my eyes, and ears. I was seeing the impact of what they were doing, on what was going on around me. I watched their look change, their sound change, and it was exciting. It affected me greatly. What was coming next? Sadly, it ended way too soon.<br /><br />Listening to the early mono remasters, I still marvel at what an incredible rock singer John Lennon was. These releases bring his voice to the forefront. I marvel at how great George Harrison was on guitar. And Paul is a monster on bass. And Ringo kept the beat like no other drummer. You can hear how good these men are on these releases. The album's music is in your face, they punch, they shine, they are crisp and clear. The Beatles sound like they are supposed to sound, on these releases.<br /><br />A couple of notes. Listening to, Revolver, is breathtaking. In my opinion, it is the greatest rock album ever. The holy grail, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is the jewel in this set, though. When I played this album, and granted, I had a lot of watts behind it, I was almost blown over the back of my couch! This mono release is AMAZING! I had long ago forgotten the massive differences between the mono and stereo version. You need to find out for yourself. It will knock you out I could not believe my ears. I still can't. The album is a masterpiece of sound, engineering and talent. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Also, of note, the albums, Help!, and, Rubber Soul, have both the mono and stereo versions included, and the mono versions are stunning. The included booklet will explain a lot of the differences you will hear, but the real treat is discovering them for yourself.<br /><br />I just wanted all of you to know that this mono set, which contains the high water mark of rock music, by this beautiful band, is worth having in your collection. When you get yours, if it brings you the joy it is bringing me, it is well worth it.<br /><br />Especially, to remember. A certain time. A certain place.

B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I bought this CD thinking it was music from the movie but it is not....it is MJ's original music that I already own. The second disc is the only reason I am glad that I bought this CD.
B000000WA4|2.0|One reviewer here sums up this confusing musical presentation by describing it as an \\"opus\\" in one sentence and \\"unfocused\\" immediately thereafter. Wait til the valium kicks in.  Thank God Amazon has the preview feature.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I was only remotely familiar with the comic, not having ever read it (found the art style unattractive, I was a Marvel guy and preferred the more clean line art of Byrne, Smith, Adams at the time), but who can pass up a 3 hour superhero movie? It was a great alternate world adventure, perhaps a little too obsessed with lingering on unsavory details and gore, but communicating pretty well to a non-follower. A labor of love, certainly, and probably a blueprint for how many movies will look in the future. The Rohrschach character was the best, with some awesome scenes and at least one highly memorable one- (or maybe two-) liner. After a little time probably worth watching more than once or twice.
B00005M2CP|5.0|In my opinion this is the greatest movie of all time in any category.  Not crazy about Godfather III, but collection wouldn\\"t be complete without it.  I can watch it repeatedly any time.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|The Proposal is your typical, high-grossing romantic-comedy with the inevitable, predictable conclusion with an interesting set-up. These kinds of romantic-comedies must be judged differently than the average film. These films are not made to be appreciated, they're made to be enjoyed...Some are too familiar or poorly written to be enjoyed, but what makes The Proposal a winner is the better-than-average writing and the actor's playing the leads.    Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, the assistant to a stern book-editor named Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). Margaret is a Canadian and is suddenly faced with deportation; rather than lose her job, Margaret claims to be engaged to Andrew. With a nosy immigration officer breathing down their necks (what they're doing constitutes fraud), Margaret accompanies Andrew to Alaska for the weekend to meet his family.     A cute romantic-comedy setup, although we all know where it's going, but you get Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen as Andrew's parents and the wonderful Betty White as his grandmother.     Discussing the plot or any filmmaking aesthetics such as cinematography is futile, but one thing worth discussing is the performances specifically by the two leads. Reynolds and Bullock play off each other so well; you can just about pinpoint the reason for the film's success. Their sarcastic bickering is not particularly profound, but they have great comedic timing with each other and amusing chemistry as well. Another surprise is that Reynolds is finally starting to hit his stride as an actor, leaving behind the hyper Van Wilder persona that has plagued his previous film roles. Bullock does pull off the stern attitude of her character, but she doesn't have the menacing, realistic quality that Meryl Streep pulled off in The Devil Wears Prada.    The Proposal is a charming, albeit predictable romp that makes for a great date move or just a way to pass the time. The Proposal could have been a terrific romantic-comedy, as it proves by it's first act but once it starts to go the way of the unwritten romantic-comedy handbook it becomes just another amusing way to pass the time. Worth checking out though.    GRADE: B-
0805066349|5.0|This is the Classic it was made to be by history. It is the story of conflict, greed, war crimes, torture embedded in the Euro-American DNA. It could well be India, Africa or the Middle East in illustrating the capacity for cruelty and the conspiracy between the Cross and the Crown to demonize humans as a pre-condition to Genocide/race colonization and Exceptionalism based on Divine and Human tenets of racial superiority. In his detailed documentations of \\"wars\\" which were actually massacres, Dee Brown overlooks a simple moral observation that has saturated books on Native Americans: that white men simply had no business here!  All the history that sadly ensued begs that simple moral verity. A must read book that should be supplemented by any of Vine Deloria's works on how the \\"assimilate or exterminate\\" imperialism and crimes against humanity endure today in each of our Republic's fifty states.    Vine Deloria: God is Red; Custer Died for You Sins; We Talk, You Listen.
1401923119|4.0|It is kinda technical for the first half of the book then makes sense as you finish the book.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|I thought this film was a pretty good sequel to the first as it wasn't over the top as sequels usually are and the plot was decent as it focused on royal siblings at odds of each other with one trying to enslave humanity and the other trying to uphold the peace. Most of the original casts comes back for this one and Abe Sapien gets a lot more screen time than that from the first which is a good thing cuz I thought his performance was brilliant (especially the dialogues between him and the princess). The scenery of the film is also worth to mention because at one point of the film, it kind of reminded me of Tim Burton's \\"Edward Scissor Hands\\". Despite this comic hero does not belong to the notorious Marvel or DC, I still recommend this film to all comic book movie goers as this one is not one to miss.
B0029O08WA|2.0|After getting the Twilight soundtrack when it first came out and loving it, I was eagerly anticipating the release of the New Moon soundtrack.  That eagerness turned to disappointment about halfway through the CD.  I kept hoping, thinking \\"Okay, maybe the next song will be better...\\".  It just didn't strike me at all.  There are a couple songs on there that I like, Meet Me at the Equinox being one of them. But overall, I just didn't find this soundtrack worthy of what I am hoping the movie will be. And after a few songs, they all seemed to blend into one another; there wasn't enough musical variety in my opinion.  The songs aren't BAD, per se, but it isn't comparable to the Twilight sountrack which I can listen too repeatedly and not get tired of.  I am really hoping that the Eclipse soundtrack will be much better than this.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore does it again, this time attacking the Private Insurers by interviewing their former clients whom which they've tossed out like garbage. This film proves my theory that the once great nation we live in today is not about moral values anymore, only money. But I'm not terribly upset by this old news because if I had half as much money as the Private Insurers do, I would not be worrying about what is happening to others, I be worrying what to be spending my next big salaried income on. The only god that is actually evident here on Earth is in our wallets \\"In God We Trust\\" amen and God Bless America.
0316069906|1.0|There is no doubt that factory farming practices are inhumane and dangerous to environmental as well as human health. The issue of food is not merely an ideological problem though, as Foer imagines it, even if it is seductive to become righteous about it in that way. Biology is, for better or worse, stronger than ideology in the long run (dead in the name of an ideal is still dead, not to mention that it represents an ideological extremism that we really should learn to become more critical about, as it's done, historically, and continues to do, so much damage to humanity).<br /><br />I was a vegetarian for years and now have spent years repairing the damage I did to my body because of it. The best ethical solution isn't righteousness, but balance. People tend to become very passionate when their thinking is locked in extremes, but in fact the issue of healthy eating and healthy ethics is about balancing priorities in a way that doesn't sacrifice the organism (including the human organism) at the alter of an ideal, whether pro- or anti- animal-eating. The human organism evolved in and through or at least alongside eating animals, and for better or worse our bodies have evolved to require them to function properly and optimally. I realize it's difficult and painful for some people to face this fact, it was very difficult for me, until my health demanded that I begin to take off the ideological, and far too idealistic, glasses I was wearing.<br /><br />Studying and applying holistic nutrition was a wake up call for me. The reductive model of nutrition that vegetarians use to defend and justify their ideals just doesn't hold up (especially in practice as opposed to theory) to the scope and complexity of holistic nutrition. Reductive nutrition is similar to the seemingly logical and practical, and yet ultimately reductive, \\"science\\" of factory farming. Weston Price and Francis Pottenger are the historical founders of a holistic view of nutrition, and I highly encourage anyone interested in health to look into their groundbreaking work (plenty of contemporary holistically-minded nutritionists follow in their path, too). Their interest was not to search out the origins of disease, but to search out the origins of health on a global scale, and the answer, they found, was a holistic nutrition that they discovered depended on a variety of animal meats and products.<br /><br />A truly balanced and healthy (nutritionally, ecologically and ethically) view would eliminate traditional factory farming (which exists only for profit, not health), and implement ways we can take care of our nutritional and ethical needs together. We don't need to eat massive quantities of meat to be healthy, and the moderate amounts that health requires should be grass-fed/pasture-raised/healthy-ocean-raised. If there are simply too many people in the world to allow for that, the issue of over-population as a problem and unsustainable health-risk needs more serious attention.<br /><br />Extremism, especially ideological extremism, is seductive, but it's a dangerous solution. History and our present global political situation make that very clear.

B001TOD92C|4.0|The film has a pretty promising plot line about an old man way passed his glory days and yet refuses to accept the reality. I've really felt for this pass time wrestler as the issues he is facing was down right heartbreaking and had me teary-eyed and everything. The one thing That disappointed me the most in this film was the ending or the should I say, the lacking of. There was no significant closure for this character whom which you've grown a heart for throughout the whole entire progression of the film, which left me completely disheartened and disappointed. Darren Aronofsky had another good one here but then blew it at the very end of the film. Unbelievable. Hence, the 4-Star rating. Don't believe me, watch it for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.
0812979656|4.0|I have not read the book yet--it is for a November book club.  But it was received in excellent condition and in a timely manner.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A great film that is just so well done in all aspects you've come to expect from a movie (except that \\"Feel Good\\" feeling after watching the movie). The tragedy of this film was so sad because it reflects off the realities of real life which is usually not a perfect happy Hollywood ending and I appraise it for being so. The plot was very well done and had me cheering for the characters to reach their dreams they have set to pursue even though the world around them was beginning to collapse. It was as if every time something bad happened to one of the characters I would say to myself \\"It can't get any worst than that\\" but tragically, it does. I would recommend this film to those who loves a good drama as this film is packed with plenty of that.
B001CZVVVE|4.0|Obviously you have to be an Opera fan to appreciate these segments. Ramon Vargas is absolutely top notch and the rest of them fill in very well. My only objection is that the camera moves a bit too much instead of stying more focused on the artists. The sound is excellent, would recommend it to anyone who loves Operas. Daniel from Mexico City.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|I had heard good things about this movie and of course about its great twist ending. Like others we spent most of the time trying to figure out what the twist could be. We had it figured out about half way through at least to a point; unfortunately that was the most entertaining part of the movie.<br />It was very predictable and in some cases just lazy in its attempt in being cunning, the Dad was a complete moron, the psychologist needed to be killed, why didn't anyone kill her?<br />This movie could have been so much better if they would have just spent a little more time making the orphan a bit more believable in her manipulations. I mean who wouldn't guess that as soon as the mother told her Mother in-law to make sure Isabelle stays put, the Mother in-law gives her a dollar for a soda around the corner.<br />If you liked the (Good son, bad seed) and so on, this will not disappoint and Isabelle Fuhrman plays the part very well. The twist is good, but the finish is very predictable...

People involved in copywriting, branding, advertising or any other form of marketing communications will benefit from this book as it will cause you to really think about your most compelling benefit and how to best communicate it.  Also, anyone who needs to present ideas to motivate action in others will most assuredly take some things away that will make their presentations stronger and more effective.<br /><br />The stories and case studies in this book provide brilliant illustrations on how humans do not always respond or behave in expected ways.  It is this fact that means that understanding your audience is key to understanding how to best communicate with them.

B00004VVNB|1.0|Gawd, what a disappointment.  Somehow, I'd had fond memories from my teen years about this flick... I must have been pretty drunk or stoned (or both) at the time. Maybe I saw it at a drive-in on a hot date, and only really saw a few parts?  Or maybe my teenaged libido just reacted to the then-rare excitement of seeing a brief glimpse or two of Jenny Aguttar's naked body, I don't know, but something possessed me to try to relive some past joys by buying this thing.  What a mistake.<br /><br />The only cast member who could even act his way out of a paper bag was Peter Ustinov, who must still be spinning in his grave to have ever been associated with this silly piece of tripe.  And could that cardboard cutout really be the same Michael York who was so effective in Cabaret? Jordan and Aguttar... well, one never really expects much from them anyway. But it is actually painful to see Fawcett stumbling her way through this early movie role... you can almost hear the director yelling \\"look just like the poster, Farrah-- just smile, don't move!\\"<br /><br />The props/effects are almost entirely laughable-- a \\"killer robot\\" who appears to be made from tinfoil, \\"energy guns\\" that look like halloween sparklers, fight and chase sequences that would fit right into any c-rated 60's Japanese monster movie, etc.  The whole thing actually seems like more of a spoof on sci-fi flix; but sadly, it isn't... at least, not intentionally.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this stinker came out the same year they were filming Star Wars, and the advent of the \\"new\\" sci-fi era... it really belongs back in the early 50's, with such \\"classics\\" as Invasion of the Green Saucer People from Another Planet. I guess this might serve as a pretty good party movie-- the guests could all get trashed and laugh their butts off at the sheer stupidity of the writing & acting.<br /><br />With the exception of some of the \\"Washington in ruins\\" backdrops toward the end of the film, and maybe Ustinov's quirky character, the ONLY good thing about this movie is the wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith-- one of the first real film composers to effectively use electronic effects merged with the usual orchestral arrangements.  It would be worth it to search out this soundtrack on a cd, so's not to be distracted by the inanity of the movie itself.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this arfer.  If you want to see some much better sci-fi's from that general time period, try Soylent Green, Rollerball, Planet of the Apes, or Silent Running (I won't even mention 2001-- that's in a class by itself).  Hell, even Westworld and Zardoz were far better than this bit of shallow fluff.this movie is the wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith-- one of the first real film composers to effectively use electronic effects merged with the usual orchestral arrangements.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|First. please let me say that I adore (nay, worship) the Harry Potter stories. So, being a gen-you-wine \\"Potter-Head\\" I was first in line to see Half-Blood Prince.    It was an interesting movie. Nice special effects.   Disjointed enough however that one MUST have seen all the previous movies and/or read the books to follow the plot.     ...Most importantly, it bears little resemblance to the Harry Potter books!!!    Really. I can forgive replacing the actions of one character with another character, to save time, I can even forgive eliminating whole chapters for the sake of brevity, but to change scenes, edit whole parts, and invent whole chapters???    Beware, below, there be SPOILERS! Don't read if you haven't watched!  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Some examples of lost scenes:    -Dumbledore confronting the Dursley's? Gone.  -The invention of a fight at the burrow, including the destruction of the whole house? Really? Where's Bill & Fleur going to get married next movie? (Oh that's right, in the movies, they AREN'T! Heck, they aren't even in -this- movie!)  -The \\"Meeting of the Ministers\\" scene? Gone. Heck there's absolutely NO sign of Scrimgeour -anywhere- in the whole movie!  -Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)  -The slow build up leading to the Quiddich victory kiss? Gone. Now just a \\"close your eyes\\" peck in the Room of Requirement, and this was done horribly!!  -The two months of Harry & Ginny dating? Gone.  -Harry breaking up with Ginny to protect her? Gone!  -Harry's ownership of Grimmauld Place and Kreacher? (Key for the next movie) Gone.  -The Gaunt house flash-backs? Both gone. And with them any mention of Merope, Voldemort's mother. Gone too the mention of her locket by Caractacus Burke.  -The memories ofHokey the house elf, and of Dumbledore's job interview with Voldemort? (Key for the next movie) Gone. In fact, all references to the valuable heirlooms such as Hufflepuff's cup are gone.  -Crabb & Goyle polyjuiceing into girls to stand watch? (would have been funny, but...) Gone.  -Snapes \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts\\" lessons? Gone.  -Apparition lessons and test? Gone.  -Hermione & Ron's Prefect status? (Well, since it wasn't mentioned LAST film, why mention it now?)  -Harry's appointment as Quiddich captain? (Not mentioned, only implied during the tryouts)  -Mundungus stealing Sirius' property? (KEY for the next movie) Gone.  -Snap's betrayal of Trelawney's prophecy to Voldemort? (HUGE!) Gone!!!  -Harry petrified by Dumbledoor to protect him? GONE!  -The Hogwarts battle between Death Eaters and Order members? (and Bill's disfigurement?) GONE!!  -Dumbledore's funeral? GONE!!!!    ...oh sure, we'll probably get to see a few of the minor bits I've mentioned in the \\"deleted scenes\\" portion of the \\"Deluxe\\" version of the DVD, but for this screen version, We get such useless add-on scenes as:  -All the trees around the burrow (HP 2/the flying car shot) have been cut down and replaced by a marsh?  -Harry wandering the underground, and chatting up a waitress??  -The aforementioned Burrow fight and subsequent burning??    Not to mention, Harry NOT petrified, but willingly hiding and watching Dumbledore's assassination? (Does anyone besides me see how that fundamentally would change Harry's view of himself?) Yeash!    And WHAT the heck was up with Jessie Cave/Lavender Brown? Worst acting since Brother Sun/Sister Moon! They tested 7000 girls, and they picked a 2nd rate ham? In fact, they tested using the hospital scene, which was single-handedly the worst scene she did in the film!    Ok, ok, on the positive side, the Quidditch tryouts and match were well done, and Dumbledore and Harry's apparition is depicted quite well.     All in all, I am happy they are making Harry Potter movies, but they are -nothing- compared to the books, and THIS one should be prefaced with \\"Loosely based on the novel by J. K. Rowling\\"!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This has to be by far one of the best movies this year. Even if Sci-Fi isn't a genre you really like this movie is worth checking out. With a low budget they manage to make this movie amazing & mind blowing. Once you watch this you will question humanity.<br /><br />Now for Blu-ray I have to say if you own a PS3 you need to buy this on Bl-ray there will be a God of War 3 playable demo include on the disc. Also once you finish the demo it will unlock extras. [ex: parts of the making of the game] Also the Blu-ray technology lets them pack more extras then on a normal dvd disc. This movie is a must watch ! ! ! ! I can't stress it more to people check out this awesome amazing movie !

B001EN71DQ|5.0|I was sad to part with my Phantom Menace DVD, which was probably one of the first DVD films I purchased, but when I saw that this space-saving boxset was coming out, I sold my TPM/AOTC/ROTS films and opted for this slimmer option. Overall, everything is the same - no new deleted scenes or anything, just a nice visual companion to the un-altered Original Trilogy boxset that I've reviewed.
B002NPUCRQ|1.0|Record companies need to stop \\"double-dipping\\" with all these deluxe, platinum editions etc.  It has become the norm to throw a couple new songs on a successful album and re-release it to make more money without having to actually pay for an entire new album to be recorded.  And I'm sure 15 years down the road there will be an \\"Ultimate Edition' released, containing even more songs that didn't make the final album.<br /><br />This version of the album has 5 new songs and 1 remix, plus the DVD with 5 music videos & some behind the scenes stuff.  None of the 5 new songs are as good as the 13 on the original album, which is probably why none of them have been released as a single to support this \\"platinum edition\\" of the album.  I bought the album for the music videos and the 5 new songs, but after listening to the songs I was very disappointed.  They sound like 5 songs that weren't good enough to be on the original album, so they saved them for later to make a few bucks extra on this version.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you already own the first version of Fearless then this is probably not worth the money for you.  But if you didn't buy the original version yet then this is a good deal because you get a few extra songs plus the music videos for a couple bucks more than the original CD cost.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|After all the hype (pro AND con), I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of the most intelligently written sc-fi/horror flix I've ever seen.<br /><br />There's a bit of subtle social satire buried between the lines, and a pretty fair amount of incidental humor as well... particularly in the early \\"party\\" sequence, which starts with every indication of just being another boring \\"yuppie tweens in trouble\\" yawner. Don't be fooled, though... that's just the set-up, and it really helps to pay attention to all the details (if only to try to keep all the names straight, later.) It doesn't take long before all hell suddenly breaks loose, and you are convincingly sucked into the chaos and panic of the emergency that ensues.<br /><br />Not to be too much of a spoiler, but I particularly enjoyed the touch of having the film being represented as a \\"found\\" going-away party tape, which happened to accidentally erase most of an earlier, date movie made by one of the main characters... this really helps to flesh out the personalities and adds to what is a surprisingly deft character development for this type of film. (Hint--pay attention when the unerased parts of the earlier video peep through.)<br /><br />I also appreciated the fact that when things really hit the fan, the viewer never knows much more about what's going on than the movie's characters. This really adds to the suspense, and draws you emotionally into their viewpoint, and the immediacy and confusion of their plight. Also helpful is the lack of a dramatic or trendy hit-laden film score. Though they may have lost in after-marketing, they gained in atmosphere, and realism.<br /><br />One warning though-- if you didn't like the jerky hand-held camera and the you've-got-to do-some-thinking-to-know-what's-happening aspect of, say, the Blair Witch Project, then you won't like this flick either. Some people get downright queasy when the camera isn't balanced by those expensive studio gyros, y'know? And maybe also when they actually have to think things through, rather than just sitting & screaming at splattering blood and severed body parts.<br /><br />To wrap up, I thoroughly enjoy this DVD-- It's a keeper. The story line is surprisingly well planned and executed, especially considering the relatively small budget. And the writers don't insult the viewer by \\"explaining\\" everything at a jr-high school level, as so many films do these days. The acting is actually quite good, for the most part (again, a pleasant surprise). The, um, \\"critters\\" are well conceived, well represented, and pretty damned convincing.<br /><br />The only real complaint I've got with this film is minor, and probably directly due to the budget limitations-- there's a rather obvious inaccuracy regarding the size of the statue of liberty's head-- you'll know what I mean when you see it.think things through, rather than just sitting & screaming at splattering blood and severed body parts.

B001EN71DG|5.0|I know a lot of folks are deeply upset that Lucasfilm put out the 2004 Original Trilogy, which included even more changes than the Special Editions of the late 90's, and then later made a new boxset with the un-tampered-with films, knowing that Star Wars enthusiasts like myself would not be able to say no. True, but I just sold my 2004 boxset and my individual Prequel films, and opted for these two new sets, which take up much less space, and look fantastic in any DVD collection. It's nice to see the \\"correct\\" snow cave scene in TESB, and enjoy the \\"true\\" Jabba's dancer scene, not to mention the absolute superiority of the original Return of the Jedi ending. None of the SE or 2004 changes were necessary - the only possible exception being the hologram scene featuring Ian McDiarmid, which I do enjoy. But if you prefer the new revisions, those films are also included. You still get beautiful menu screens and nice covers, although more extras never hurt anyone!

B001C08RHA|4.0|I enjoy this film every time I watch it. There was a lot of hype going into Iron Man, and the film satisfied nearly everyone. The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more. The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film. I hope the sequal is just as good.
0061122416|1.0|The story was ok but it really went nowhere. Going on and on about his \\"personal legend\\" and the \\"soul of the world\\" and the \\"language of the world\\" made me think the author must be on acid or something. Sorry, but unless the author and I are in the same place in our minds, I just don't know what he is talking about and he didn't give me enough information to figure it out. Enough of these mystic books already. It'll probably be made into another bad movie.
1577311523|5.0|This book has helped me tremendously in keeping my balance in a crazed world.  I had heard about it for years, and I am so glad I read it, that I can't even regret not getting to it sooner!  It may be confusing or of only passing interest to many people, but for people who have been seeking more light and more sight for a while, THE POWER OF NOW can be a very bright dawn.
B002S0OBFK|2.0|I won't say this is a bad movie, or boring, but I will say to the people who are saying this is the scariest thing they have seen in years, and some even said ever... are you kidding me? There is nothing scary about this film, it's entertaining enough to keep you watching, but a few noises in the night and a door moving, or sounds played backwards to sound demonic isn't anything but old typical cheap tricks made in every other horror movie of the past. This one is just in a style that is shot on a home camera, so expect a Blair Witch type of thing; no music, no soundtrack, no edited footage like a normal movie. However, if you are someone who was scared by the likes of Horror House in 3D then this one may send shivers up your spine. However to an avid horror or thriller movie fan, you know going into this that NOTHING is based on a true story that ever happened in the real world, and know that the stories of this being based on a true story is a marketing scam for it to make money on a low budget film.    The visual effects in the movie are nothing special, so don't go in expecting to see some cool things happening and wondering how they did that? It's a very low budget film that was apparently made for about $11,000. The acting however is decent, there is very few actors in the whole movie, but the ones that are in it do a decent job of delivering the story and it's refreshing to see the leading lady isn't a stupid skinny bimbo who got the role cause she starved herself to death.    Overall I'm not saying to avoid the movie; I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up too high and believe the hype about it from those who rarely see a scary kind of movie. It's far from being in the top 100, even top 500 scariest movies of all time. It is a far cry from being the scariest movie since Poltergeist, even tho I disagree that one is the scariest of all time either, but for the time being, this is one of those movies that is currently in fashion to see, and it may do well when it's released on DVD, but I am expecting it to be remembered as just one of those films that got parodied to death. There is already is a large amount of spoofs on the web right now, and I expect Scary Movie 5 will be targeting this one heavily.
B00012QM9K|5.0|This is a film that will move you. It draws you in to the action on the screen so that you feel the emotions and the terror of the events unfolding before you. The opening music is hauntinglty beautiful. The story is heartbreaking and joyful. It shows you that one person can make a difference. And shows you the monstrosity of one man (Hitler) as well.  The Voices From the List on the collector's edition is worth the cost of the DVD. These are survivors who worked in Schindler's factory. A first person account of what they witnessed.
0691142165|3.0|Is not so easy  to read as it seems. It is a full-fledged academic study. Before you finish it, we would be in another bubble that obviously will look completely different from the other ones.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I love every song on this album and I can't stop listening to it. A little hint-don't move quickly to  track 1 after track 10-there are some lovely surprises there for you!
0765356147|4.0|this series is one that I truly enjoyed reading. I mostly enjoyed the character's developement how Vin grew from being a shy, self-doubting street girl to an amazing woman able to trust and love, how Elend grew from being a bookworm with a penchant for philosophy to a true leader, and how Spook finally was able to overcome evil and stay true to himself.  I also found interesting that the third book gave so many details about the Lord Ruler, his motivations and how he came to be what it was... this was perhaps the most interesting part of the book to me.    The ending came as a big surprise to me, I really did not see that one coming. But suffice to say that it really tied up nicely and made sense.  The only thing I was left wondering: what in the world happened to Marsh?!!!    All in all, a great trilogy, and recommended reading!!!!
1582701709|1.0|This \\"movement\\" of believing in \\"The Secret\\" shows that \\"new age\\" has gone to far. I am an Arizona citizen living 2 hours from Sedona, where the tragic events took place. The fact that the co author charged high prices for people to attend his retreat, and then recklessly killed two people and forced another number of people to be hospitalized, is beyond reprehensible.  Quit believing that these so called shamans for the rich are some how going to lead you to an enlightened life. It's just awful.

B002G1X34G|5.0|When Liv Kristine was in Theatre Of Tragedy, they were one of the first bands to use classical female vocals and gruff male vocals, the so-called \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" genre. Kristine started Leaves Eyes a few years ago, and \\"Njord\\" is their third full-length. Her husband Alexander Krull is the male vocalist and producer, and his band Atrocity is also Leaves Eyes' backing band.    It's been four years since their last studio album \\"Vinland Saga,\\" and Leaves Eyes has made a nice progression on \\"Njord.\\" The songs are intricately composed, combining delicate classical influences with powerful metal guitars. The songs run the gamut from loud, bombastic and symphonic to quiet and fragile.     The album kicks off with the title track, which builds slowly into a cinematic and diverse song with Kristine's singing offset by Krull's growls. \\"Emerald Island\\" is a strong song, ebbing and flowing in tempo and intensity. \\"Through Your Veins\\" is one of the most accessible and mainstream leaning songs on \\"Njord,\\" with all melodic vocals and a nice combination of heaviness and melody.     \\"Irish Rain\\" is more subdued with acoustic guitars, a prominent flute, reserved vocals and more of a folk metal vibe. \\"Morgenland\\" is also in that vein, with piano and Kristine's vocals in the forefront. Leaves Eyes tackles the traditional English ballad \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" popularized by Simon and Garfunkel in the mid 1960s. It's given a symphonic arrangement with plenty of guitars and atmosphere, and is well-done.     The lyrical concept of \\"Njord\\" covers Nordic mythology. Kristine's vocal performance on this album is outstanding. Her voice runs the gamut from quiet and emotional to \\"regular\\" singing to belting it out in a powerful classical style. She also sings in an astounding eight languages on the album, including English, Norwegian, Gaelic, and even a made up language for one brief sequence.    Sometimes symphonic/gothic metal albums get too caught up in the orchestral arrangements and forget about things like choruses and melody. \\"Njord\\" has both painstakingly composed and arranged songs along with memorable hooks and choruses. It's hands down the band's strongest effort thus far.

B002M2N9JI|5.0|Duffy came out sounding like she could have been from the 60's.  La Roux sounds like she is direct from the 80's.  A perfect blend of the Human League, OMD, and early Erasure, with the attitude of Pink thrown in to spice it up.  The albm has remained in my listening rotation since I downloaded it.  Catchy, memorable, easy to sing along to.  Love listening to this album, especially Tigerlilly, Bulletproof, and In for the Kill.
0547258305|5.0|I'm not going to give you a summary of the book, just know it's incredible!  The characters are strong, and its easy to pick up on their traits and get a good feel of who they are.  The relationships between the characters is half its greatness!  It's not easy to get a good grasp on the intimacy of fighting,  The beginning draws you in quickly, and forms the plot nicely; the end is a BIT anti-climactic, but over all its a good read.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|what a great movie this is - i can't wait to get this dvd! how i love to watch mj dance - i've never seen anything like it before. he definitely has all his moves right on and even adds some surprises too! this movie gives insight into how mj was during rehearsals and it was really cool to see him joking around sometimes and really running things in such a way as to show gentle respect, yet still get what he needed out of people performace wise.     i saw this 3 times - the 1st was by myself at midnight on tues, then i took my oldest 3 kids to see it this morning (thursday) and my husband and i went tonight together. really the cutest part for me was when i took my 3 kids and my 5 yr old talked during a transition when it was all quiet in the theater - it was the part at the end of smooth criminal when mj jumps through the window and the glass breaks - she goes, \\"is michael jackson okay??\\"     this truly would have been such a cool comeback! it wowed me and was a mix of emotions, too - i was really happy because i love his music and watching him dance, but at the same time i was sad because he never got to present what he was working on to the world. i think he was a really strong person to put together something like this after everything he went through at the hands of hurtful people. i could tell he was really enjoying every second of what he was doing - as i did watching it. what a \\"thriller\\" he was!
0439023491|5.0|To be honest, this review is actually going to be kind of a non-review. Since the book is so new, I don't want to give ANYTHING away. What I will say is Catching Fire starts very soon after The Hunger Games end: Katniss and Peeta are back in District 12 as the winners of the Hunger Games. President Snow is VERY unhappy because Katniss made the Capitol look like fools. And it seems that she might possibly be the new face of a rebellion that is starting.<br /><br />Did I think Catching Fire was as good as The Hunger Games? Damn skippy, I did! I was amazed at how quickly I got sucked right back into the story. I wasn't sure where Collins was going to go with this book, and I was actually shocked at the direction she took. Heartbreaking at times, and heart stopping at others, Catching Fire is another whirlwind of a book. I was so caught up in reading it, I even considered calling off work just to finish it! (For the record, I was good, and put the book down to go to work!)<br /><br />There are a few new characters that are introduced in this book, most notably Finnick Odair, another previous winner of The Games. Collins has expanded the dystopian world she created and it is actually more frightening that the first book! And while Katniss and Peeta are still the main focus, some of the more secondary characters really come to life, especially Haymitch, Gale, and President Snow.<br /><br />I really can't say any more without giving something away. Just know that Catching Fire is one fantastic read!! The only bad thing I have to say is now that I've read it (almost 6 weeks before it's actually released), I don't know if I can wait to read the conclusion to the trilogy!
B002MBAJ4M|3.0|I am very diaappointed with this offering from Govt Mule. This album just does not rock like the others.     Three songs are worthy of mention.     1. \\"Broke Down on the Brazos\\"....This is easily the best song on the album. Warren and Bily Gibbons get down and dirty on this one. Its badass Texas stomp. Billy Gibbons put his stamp on this one, and I love it. The back and forth guitar tradeoffs after the break are nasty.     2. \\"Steppin Lightly\\"    3. \\"Scenes From a Troubled Mind\\"    The rest of the songs are just not what I expected from this power trio...(quartet, sorry). I want to ROCK.....like Govt Mule CAN rock, but \\"By A Thread\\" is like Warren went off on some strange experimental trip.    We're a long way from the last album, let alone their debut, and Im not crazy about the new direction.    Warren, please come back to your power trio roots.

141041986X|5.0|\\"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth, but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. Today is the day of the reaping.\\"<br /><br />For 16-year-old Katniss (and yes, I really hate this name!) Everdeen, the day of the reaping is a day to dread. Panem, the country that was once North America before natural disasters and war laid waste to it, holds a \\"reaping\\" once a year. It is the Capitol's way of punishing the 12 districts of Panem for the \\"uprising\\". Each year, the 12 districts hold a drawing that will provide one girl Tribute and one boy Tribute to the Hunger Games. The 24 Tributes are taken to an arena and dropped off. Imprisoned together, it is ever child for him- or herself. There can only be one winner of the Hunger Games, and it is a fight to the death.<br /><br />Each child between the ages of 12 and 18 is eligible for the reaping. District 12, The Seam, is the coal-mining district. They have only had one winner of the Hunger Games since it started. On the day of the reaping, all the kids are brought into the town square for a televised drawing. But this year, when Katniss' 12-year-old sister, Prim's name is drawn, there is a volunteer to take her place. Katniss is not going to let her sister go to be slaughtered. She immediately volunteers to go as the girl Tribute instead of Prim. Along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son and the boy Tribute from District 12, Katniss is whisked away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Because Katniss has spent the last few years providing for her family by hunting in the Seam, she feels she would have a better chance at survival than her little sister. Because frankly, being chosen for the reaping is a death sentence. Other districts have kids that are bred to be winners. But even if she can't survive, at least she has the knowledge that her little sister will be saved.<br /><br />In a very Shirley Jackson sort of way, The Hunger Games is a glimpse into a terrifying future. In a world controlled completely by The Capitol, people live in fear of what can be taken from them. Even the games themselves are controlled by the Capitol. Each child can have sponsors that give them certain items to help them in the games. And if there isn't enough \\"action\\" to satisfy the powers that be, then the Capitol steps in and makes things more difficult for the contestants.<br /><br />Collins has created a truly horrific look into the future. As a mother, the thought of such an events as the reaping or the Hunger Games makes me a little sick to my stomach. But as a reader and a lover of good fiction, this book is top-notch! Katniss is about as smart and as tough as a protagonist can be. I just fell in love with her. The Hunger Games starts out with a bang, but the suspense doesn't let up...ever! As a reader, you know there isn't going to be a good ending with this one, but Collins never lets you give up hope. From page one, you are immediately sucked in and just can't let go!! I practically read this in one sitting, it was so intense. I just needed to know what happens. Although there is clearly an ending....there is still more of the story to be told. Again, there is a follow-up book that won't be released till the fall. Damn. What is it with me and and the inevitable series reading?? Regardless of that, this is one intense read, and I highly recommend it!!ay, The Hunger Games is a glimpse into a terrifying future.

B002US3V74|4.0|I can't say my attention ever wandered for a moment although it was riveted by really melodramatic plot elements.  It is hard to say who is in more trouble, Sean or Christian. Sean not only has women problems, he's got children problems. And Christian steers a fellow plastic surgeon to a transvestite store to mess him up but it ends up producing great benefits for the guy. The patient this time insists on using leeches post op to speed up the healing on her face.  Interesting but dangerous.  This is not edifying stuff but it does keep me glued to the tv.
B002TUETW4|3.0|I don't understand, another greatest hits album?  The performances in the movie, which were rehearsals mind you, were incredible!  This makes no sense, everyone owns these songs already.  If anything why not offer the remastered versions alongside the live versions.  The demo's are great, but otherwise: fail.
0385751060|4.0|The blurb tells the expectant reader, after informing them that giving too many clues would spoil the reading of the book, and explaining only that they will go on a journey with Bruno who will sooner or later arrive at a fence.<br />Thus I will also not give away more than that, but what an excellent idea and well executed too. Some have criticised the story for being unrealistic or unbelievable, but let us not forget that the subject mattter the story deals with itself is incredible, and yet the atrocities in it and worse have truly occurred in the history of our planet.<br />As for the characterisation of Bruno, I believe that his innocence had to be exaggerated to achieve maximum impact, so one must allow for that artistic license.<br />An easy and quick, but hard-hitting read.<br />It worked for me.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a great movie for both the young and the young at heart. It is a sweet movie that makes me wish that they would still make movies like this. I especially liked that it was so simple and was able to keep my family interested despite being a movie that is over 50 years old. I also like that I have my choice of watching it either on DVD or Blu-Ray.
B00005NX0L|4.0|While I watched this, I became acutely aware of how much of a documentary it actually is, and of how many surprises are in it. Of course, there's the music, and the performers -- and yes, Anita O'Day is remarkable...dinah is too underrated today and we need more of her in jazz recordings.  The concert flies by all too soon. Late fifties' dress, hair styles...most acutely, this is an integrated audience!  In 1958 America, there were centers of integration (NY,NO, LA) but most of it was ghetto: Jewish, Italian, WASP, Black.  In the midwest(where I'm from) it was clear: 'Grosse Pointe' may have been named for its locale, but you had to fill out a questionnaire to buy, and if you didn't score the points you didn't get it--'ethnics' lost points for background, blacks lost all points from the start.  So the film is more remarkable in that it shows a segment of American society far more open and sophisticated than the rest, more likely than not united by a singular love of the music.   That said, because it is an amateur's film, there are sections poorly lit, or cut abruptly...but I bought a copy for myself and one for each of my jazz-loving godchildren, and I'd do it again in a snap.
0385504225|1.0|Let me save you some money and time:    o The lost symbol is an old bible hidden in a cornerstone buried under the Washington Monument. People are chasing around and dying for that?     o The CIA wants to stop a hidden camera video of a secret meeting of the Masons from being sent to the Internet and \\"Bringing down the Country\\".    o The villain \\"mal'akh\\" is Zach, Peter Solomon's estranged son.    The book starts off fairly well with suspense and mystery. The legends and stories of the Founding Fathers, D.C. and the Masons are put forth in a very interesting and entertaining way - however - as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the lame ending of these two plot points have a very disappointing resolution. Brown builds up the suspense and all we get is  something so bland and dumb, that all I wanted to say was: \\"So What?\\" (Cue the Mile Davis song).    Why all the elaborate codes and misdirection to prevent the discovery of an old bible sealed away in a cornerstone of a national monument that nobody is going (or could if they wanted) to dig up anyway? Why would the CIA care if some Masons initiation ritual is posted on the internet, no matter which important government bigwigs are involved? Bring down the Government? Hardly. That can be controlled and countered in so many ways I can't even begin to count them. Who would care anyway? Just invent another \\"Balloon Boy\\" and all the ruckus about Masons would be instantly forgotten.    The last 90 minutes or so is just a long boring epilogue with sophmoric philosophizing about Sky Faeries and Hope. To use an old 80's expression, \\"gag me with a spoon\\". What a letdown.    I'm just glad I didn't pay anything for this book since I got it from my library. If you have to check out this train wreck for yourself, I'd suggest you do the same and not waste good money on this tripe.    Until I read the ending I would have rated this a 3 or 4. After I read the ending it only rates a 1, and that would be generous.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|It was great to see the movie, yes, he was in control, always has been during all his rehearsals. But he was definitely not 100%, I have seen footages of previous concerts during his rehearsals and he never held back. Here, he was clearly pacing himself.  How many times did he say \\" I am saving my throat\\", he could not really hit the high notes, and when he did the Billie Jean dance, he could not replicate what he used to do, no moonwalk and just said \\" at least you get a feel of it\\".  We will never know if he was holding back to save his strength or because he knew he could not do it, as we were used to see him. I have a hard time to believe that after 120 hours of footage, the editors could not find a sequence where he was 100%. Nonetheless, he was in control and he is one of the very few who knew his music so well, each tempos, each keys...  I have seen him in concert live, twice, and to this day none can come close to the way he owned the stage, with such presence.  I will miss seeing him move and sing. \\"This is it\\" is a great DVD to own by all means...
B000028U0Y|5.0|I'd managed to go over a decade collecting a few songs from this album, but never owning it in its entirety.  Buy the album.  It's completely worth it.  There are the classics like At Folsom Prison that everyone can sing along to, songs you need for a crazy day like Cocaine Blues, and Busted for those of us who are suffering from the present economy.    It's livelier than most live albums, with brief humorous dialogue between Johnny, June, and the tough prison crowd.
