B00117W1HQ|5.0|Suspense, action, thriller, it's got it all plus a great cast.  Would recommend this show to those who love sysfi
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Oliver is more than the storey. She is her characters. Nice touch. Glad she came along before the glut of YE appeared.
B001AITH50|5.0|Usually, when I hear that many famous actors are going to be in one movie together, I think that the movie is going to suck. But this movie really proved me wrong. Amazing, emotional story, and very memorable characters. And as for the story, great job Anne Rice.
055338466X|5.0|Dr. Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow beautifully and meticulously explain to the layperson the magnificent beauty of the universe and how it came to be. As the book highlights, science has progressed in incredible ways including our understanding of the cosmos and the universe and that no supernatural explanation is needed or warranted. This is a must read book that I highly recommend for all - particularly those who want to gain an understanding and appreciation of the universe as it is, not as we may wish it to be.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was expecting more adult and hard passion love making. Listening to friends describe this book was misleading . While reading this book I felt like I was back in high school listening to a friend talk about her first time. The way these adults act is adolescent to me.
B003U4UOP4|5.0|This is indefinitely one of my favorite series of all time. Great acting, interesting plot, and the story always kept me intrigued.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry is the Phineas and Fern version of Where's My Water. Since that app went through the roof I hope that this app does too. But if you like Phineas and Fern and Where's My Water This is an app for you! I personally love this app because of Doofinsmirts. His inators and &quot;helpful&quot; hints for Perry the Platypus crack me up! I also like Major Monogram. He and Carl are trying to help Perry but don't do much at all. I think this app is a must get for Phineas and Fern fans everywhere!
B003TTMFCK|2.0|C'mon - How many devastating, life-changing tramas can one hospital have????????????? The writers need to come up with exciting, belivable drama and the some of the actors need lessons.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is great for many reasons. First, ITS A DRAWING APP! Sorry, I love to draw, so it makes sense I love this app right? Second, you can draw whatever you want and save it to your kindle or any other android device. You can even share it! The only thing is that when sometimes when I share my drawings, my friends can see it. Is that a problem with the site or with the app? I don't know. But anyways my drawings aren't as good as the ones on the pictures of the app (frankly I don't even think drawing like that on this is possible). But this app changed my world of drawing finally I can post GOOD quality drawings to my friends. You get a variety of colors witch totally helps the big price because of all the different shades<br /> The other things I used, the pictures were blurry or didn't show up at all (hence what I said earlier). But I'm just glad to have  this app. All the money to buy it is worth it.
B00445RHKI|5.0|This show is written as a comedy and it is in fact one of the funniest shows on television. The jokes are smart, witty and avoid being either stale or overly dirty. But what I really love about this show is how instead of everyone working against one another like they do on other family based sitcoms, on this show they all pull together when needed and there is love between them. Also many of the predicaments they find themselves in are the types that real families face, though funnier.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A complete presentation of the many perspectives each character has concerning the topic.  An emotional investment for all readers. Truly riveting reading.
0061950726|5.0|I have read another book by this author and liked it...this book was phenomenal!such a great story...I do not understand the one star review..this is Not a book about holocaust or anything like it...you will find yourself  drawn into the story..and as a bonus I grew up in Little Falls Mn..where the remaining orphan train children gather to remember their past!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was their most beautiful, tragic story I have read in a while. I definitely recommend it. I laughed, I cried, it in a such an amazing story.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I love Lincolns story but would of liked to see more of his childhood and so forth. I wanted to see what led him to being president
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! It is a lot more fun then Temple Run! It is my favorite game. It is so cool that it is free!!
B007NKLUV8|3.0|The obviously Zeppelin-esque \\"Life Within a Day\\" and \\"Stormchaser\\" are standouts, but that's not saying much. This album contains everything from Bonham-thundering beats to Beatles styled melodies, yet it leaves one unfilled given what the progressive genre means to those who listen to Dream Theater and Kings X, for example. The chord progressions are interesting. The vocals are Alan Parsons-like (no virtuosity evident here, just workman). The lyrics are hopelessly sophomoric (maybe freshman)- \\"Aliens are only us from the future\\" being the prime example - embarrassing, I would think.  There's also a reference to \\"To be or not to be\\" - give me a break, for God's sake.<br /><br />But... Hackett's guitar work is really versatile, creative and enjoyable, if not particularly progressive, original or technically challenging (his legato lines and tapping technique, that apparently inspired Edward Van Halen, are evident and quite impressive!). Squire's bass lines are everything you would expect from him, and are gratifying enough in that respect, yet break no new ground.  Keyboards are atmospheric and very nice if not for some cheesy progressions (like in the verse of \\"Aliens\\" - man, they should have just dumped that one or changed it heavily).<br /><br />Upon first listening I found this CD to be a disappointment.  Upon further listening (okay, it's often the case) I find a lot of things to like about this album, but I wouldn't necessarily tell anybody.  They wouldn't understand.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love my sonic screwdriver. David Tennant being my favorite, I just had to have it. The top ring of the handle before the shaft to the emitter thought had a tiny ship in it. I don't mind it that much because it kind of makes it look battle warn. I had the same sonic from the same company before and that one wasn't chipped so I know it was probably a factory mistake. It's great for cosplayers and larpers. Now if you pull the nib out to much than the grip on the nib gets loose but if you take some thin sticky velcrow and put it on the nib and in the holder that would work or some double sided tape. However.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I chose this rating because I felt the book was funny, entertaining and romantic. My interest was kept throughout the book. I however felt a disconnect from one situation to the next....like a how did we reach here....
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It's not exactly fine literature, but it's certainly entertaining. The plot is quite simple, each character has a similar arc, but there are a lot of different manifestations of that arc so it's an enjoyable read.<br /><br />A great book for travelling!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I hope that this aplication is very fuctionality also is the great help because we can organice us tieme and can control thanks for your aplication is very usefully
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Every lover of film should have this in their collection. It's one of the great performances of all time. EVERYONE in it is fabulous!
B007PTJOV0|2.0|This game sucks. It's got a similar set up to Mario but the controls are awful. Half the time when u go to jump you'll just stop moving and fall straight down. Sometimes you can correct and other times you just die. Whoever likes this game obviously is delusional or hasn't actually played Mario or is making there review based on a very young child playing the game. I hate this game and my 6yr old won't even play it. It does work though but if your expectations are very high you won't like it at all
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I listen to this cd alot.  Has a great variety of music.  Would  make a great gift.  I love it!!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I felt as if I fit in with this book this was an excellent experience and I hope to find other books like this one.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|What a feast for the eyes,  the 3d is amazing on my panasonic vt30 55&#34;. But for some reason on the 3drojector it gave huge amounts of crosstalk. Anyways the film was fun and visually stunning
0307730697|5.0|Wish Adam could have written this book.  Blehm did a fine job and I got the essence written.  Found myself skipping forward through the childhood stuff.  Skipped as much of the religious tone as I could.  Like others have written, the last half of the book goes well.<br /><br />I grew up on a rural farm in Arkansas and my cousins (from 'Bama') had similar behavioral things going -- goofy, crazy stuff kids do.<br /><br />Adam was definitely driven and developed into a selfless, loving man.  He was decent and kind, a genuine, authentic person.<br /><br />I don't understand what the heavy drug usage was about.  Addictive personality?  Because this behavior played such a large part of his adolescence, there was something missing or lacking that needed to play out.  Teens (my opinion) might experiment with drugs but do not go to the extreme Adam went to.  Hope this makes sense.  He went from one extreme to another.  Where was the balance?<br /><br />Semper Fi, Adam!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The crash sequence is very believable and very unsettling.  Much more prolonged and tense than the one in Cast Away.  You feel like you are in the cockpit trying to help get the aircraft under control.  The remainder of the move is another version of Crazy Heart, except the lead is an airline pilot instead of a country singer.  But the story is in the telling, and you find yourself hoping the Denzel Washington character can get his act together.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|An actual throw back ghost film with a ghost you actually see with classic &#34;make you jump scenes&#34;<br />cool villain story ending a bit on the weak side character development was strong in other words you actually began to care about the characters & care about the well being of them.<br />fun film to watch
B002IJ9YR6|4.0|Funny, well made, well acted. One of those movies that adults can enjoy watching with the kids.  We all loved it!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a ok game enjoy playing when I get a chance was recommend by a niece of mine like playing against each other
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This show is fun to watch, and has some nice surprises. The military people aren't completely ridiculous, like they are portrayed in most tv and movies.  I've only seen the first 3 episodes of season 1, so I'll hold judgement for now.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I really like this game but I hate that after every round there's some type of ad(s)! how can it become addictive or you get into it?
B00881PTRC|3.0|Although I've only played it a few times, it doesn't seem to have all that many words in its dictionary (and only about four categories to choose from). But since it was free, I don't mind too much.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I ended up getting into the books from the HBO show and now I'm completely hooked. The books are so much better and have much better detail & points of view.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes to listen to a different refreshing style of music. Beautiful music preformed by beautiful and talented young ladies.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I thought this book was going to be more about  Canada. We read this as a book club selection. Only one reader cared for it. Very slow and wordy
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Dates in color, great function.  Ties in with other calendars.  Love it.  Lots of personalization of you're into that.  I find white backgrounds the best, though and you have that option,too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I could not tell you how much fun I&#34;ve had playing this game.It really helps me relax after a long day at work.I&#34;m really happy I purchased this game.Hope you have more like it in the future.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Best season ever with Donna noble, in my opinion, the best companion since the resurrection of dr who from the 70's.
B001I45UFC|5.0|One of my favorites since age 5... Profound analogy interwoven into this great story. The series keeps getting better with age.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps your attention all the way through the book never gets boring you can't even our it down to sleep almost
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Could not stop watching this show! Awesome story line and the characters are great. I recommend this sho to anyone who likes science  fiction.
B000F8O35U|3.0|I absolutely love the little mermaid and was super excited to find it online for $25.98 for the 2 disc edition. However, I was very disappointed when it arrived and although it said it was\\"brand new\\" - the picture on the DVD disc was very blurry and looked as though it had been copied on. I give the little mermaid movie 5 stars because its the best, but the sellers only a 3 for false advertisement. I paid almost $29 with shipping and expected a better quality disc.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I enjoy this fun show and am glad for the revival of interest in The Doctor.  Hope you enjoy it too!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Very good actors and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great new show! I hope it isn't canceled...
B009AMANBA|5.0|Wow-I thought it was great.  Not boring like some of the other reviewers thought it was.  Yes it's about the 13th amendment so probably the people that went to see it and didn't like it was because they thought it was going to be different. But I was impressed the great acting, the story, everything!
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Any hard-core fan of Wayne will know this is one of his greatest albums ever, if you loved Dedication 4, u Will love this, It rocks hard and there is only 1 song where he goes metal, big deal, the rest of the album is hot, energy-packed and dirty. Tunechi's Back!!! I got this at Sam Goody for ten bucks, i was nervous buying it because Ive heard so many people diss it, i dont know whats wrong with people, freestyle on a another level
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  The accessories can make you feel like you are back when they were touring and the record was just released.  Product was immaculate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Have this downloaded on every device to eliminate the arguments about who gets to play next. :S Works great on iPad, kindle and razr.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love post-invasion rebelion shows. Especially with aliens. This show was fun and engaging and I can't wait to watch more!
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Good story that will really get to you...good cast that doesn't overplay their roles...I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.
0811879542|5.0|Even though I thought my son might be a little young for this book (18 months) I still bought it because I heard so many great things about it. My son absolutely LOVES this book and I can only imagine that he's going to love it even more as he get's older.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't put it down with out wondering what I was missing almost like trying to leave the room when your favorite show is on.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of those great stories so well written that you don't want to put it down and you miss reading once the story is finished!
1609611543|5.0|I did not know until reading Dr. Davis' book that wheat had been hybridized and genetically modified starting back in the 1960s. What is more disturbing is that wheat and its by-products can be found in such unlikely places as canned soups and candy bars. Dr. Davis presents a disturbing picture of the health risks associated with wheat consumption and traces the history of the grain from its cultivation beginning 10,000 years ago to the present day. After reading his book you will never look at a loaf of bread the same way again, and you will find, as I did, that the total elimination of all wheat products will help you toward living a more healthy life. I recommend this book highly.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Loved it. Don't read it expecting Dickens. Lots Of twists; I didn't know what was going to happen. And there were several times I laughed out loud. Anything that makes me do gets five stars.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|Excellent quality DVDs. It has been a long time since I watched these at the movies. A real treat to see them again at a price that is amazing. After I watched the first two shows, I ordered 2 more copies for our boys and their families.
B0000062GK|5.0|I got the cassette and I love it , but now that there is mp3 players I bought the cd so I can have it on my laptop, and if your wondering why don't I just buy the songs online, don't trust that. Well I ordered this cd and it came very quickly and in great condition. Very happy with this cd.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Lots of fun, good music and sound effects. The storyline was interesting too. My only complaint was during the hidden object portions; the zoom was very minimal, and many of the objects were so small or obscured by other  objects that I couldn't identify them even after using the hint.  Other than that, I'm looking forward to another game from this developer
B000002H97|5.0|I love Metallica but when I was in the army my room mate would play this cd every weekend, it was ok if I went out but it sucked when I stayed in my room cause he would repeat then entire cd allll day . Cd is awesome it came in great condition and shipped really fast.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Its great. I had it on my iphone before it was put on my kindle and it is updated to the new one. Amazon needs to get the latest up date to the Winkie Country.
B000001DVD|5.0|I finally bought this cd again, I had once before when I lived in Los Angeles, I listen to it every time I walked to work, it got stolen one day , so it has been years since I have had it. I was very pleased how fast it came and it was in better condition than was advertised so I am so happy.
034580404X|3.0|some parts were repeated and repeated, started to get boring. The story could have been told in one book, maybe two.
B000001FKY|4.0|I had this cd in high school but I put off getting it again cause it reminds me of a girl I really cared for back then, well I finally broke down and got it again, the first song on the cd don't play but that's ok I don't like that song anyways. I am still pleased with my purchase and it came very fast.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I rate this game 5. Must get game. Fun game to play in your spare time like sitting in the doctor's office.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch is my fab -keep them coming , I can't seem to get enough  I have read all his stuff and I am never disappointed
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved the first two books in the series.  I liked this book, but was not as into it like I was the first two books.  I had trouble putting the first two books down.  Not the case with the third.  It was good - I just liked the first two better.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|If I can not turn off the sound on the opening screen, 2 stars.  If I can not mute at all 1 star.  The app developer did not follow through after making the game.  There is no help and no settings.  Ridiculous
B007VYDFMS|4.0|Probable one of the best complete story about the life of Bob Marley...great personnel footage...I truly enjoyed the movie...Great Job..
B00683JLXA|1.0|On my Samsung galaxy tablet, the controls on the game are not precise enough to get 3 stars on every level.  If I change the zoom level it doesn't stay.
0891419063|4.0|I found it interesting the author was never wounded. Very lucky guy. My father participated in the landing at Okinawa and made it 60 days before he got hit. I feel the book exposes the insanity of war
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This is a very good movie because it shows what can happen when you get bad intel and what happens and then  the way the main character works around everything that has happened to him with out some future high tech gadgets but uses his own methods from past experiences to get the job Done!
B00B361HO8|5.0|been a boz fan since his days with Steve Miller and Mother earth (Tracy Nelson). well produced deep groove vinyl LP produces a great sound.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|A definite must read for anyone who wants to take an in-depth look at evolution from a scientific versus political or theological slant. Easy to read, easy to understand!
B003S5K8GK|5.0|Excellent show. Reminding us not to be prejudice or judgmental toward others. An autistic man, with little to no social abilities can teach the masses about humanity. Love Rain man? Well you're going to Luh-uh-vuh this!
B009AP2G26|4.0|As long as Fin, Rachael, Kurt, Santana , and Blaine get  promoninte roles Glee continues to be my favorite tv show, but E18 was<br />pathetic, the story line, the lack of music, the acting, the whole thing...this episode simply did not match the quality of other<br />episodes and I have watched them all multiple times...Larnell
B008HK3XKO|1.0|This case looks very nice but our kindle keeps falling out! Does not clip in very securely! The outside looks nice though.
B001LX2J22|5.0|small amount of screen time for Hanibal but what a pressence, a well presented tight film .Sit on the edge of your seat; you will not need to move.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's an amazing game I've had it for my iPod for one year now and am glad that it's for the kindle fire HD. I know right now I'm being kind of a jerk asking when the fourth one comes out for the kindle and not just the iPod and iPad. Thank you.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Didn't like them that much until I heard &#34;My Songs...&#34; on the radio. This has 3 great cuts and others are better than most of their former releases.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played this game for 2 years and I still enjoy it. It is a great way to pass down time. My husband has even started playing and he is hooked.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The cinematography in this movie was great!  The twist at the end was great!  I loved this movie...it got it's message across.  I wish I would have been able to replace bad memories with animals.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|For Trekkies and/or Treckers, it's an interesting mélange of story ideas where up-to-date CGI and technosplash is added to the prequel of the Original Series.
B00498TQV8|1.0|I never got it and my card was charged for it.  Damn, I hate it when that happens!!!!  Bye now.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Good movie, but not long enough nor does it explain itself as to just what the ship was doing and where the crew was going with the cruel animal it held in its cargo compartments. Much too short
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie Moved well and the acting was good Lots of action and a good ending Wanted to see it
0062238868|5.0|as you read this book you get a sense of how rough the training is and the harsh toll it takes on personal relationships outside the service. A perfect window on actual modern combat.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Just an excellent movie. I really enjoyed most everything, except the death of a key character. It was kind of a bummer
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Very cool, was a bit bias at first but I grew to love the new characters and i cant wait to see more!
1451626657|5.0|This book is my third favorite book after Ender's Game and World War Z.  The stories just drawn you in and the character focus is really just perfect.  There's not much more I can say without looking like a fanboy, but I will leave you with this.  Buy this book, read it, love it.
0060833459|5.0|There are a number of other reviews that summarize the contents of the book, so I won't attempt to do that here.<br /><br />The big picture knowledge that the book imparts, are really the key aspects to being effective in any line of knowledge work (which is most jobs today).<br /><br />These include:<br />1) Time management<br />2) Focusing on contributing value<br />3) Building on strengths as opposed to shoring up weakness<br />4) Focus on the priorities, don't let the pressures / inertia drive work output<br />5) Effective decision-making<br /><br />Some of the few negative reviews seem to think this book is outdated.  While occasionally it does feel this way (when it references how much better educated Americans are than everyone else - a throwback to the 60s), the big picture information is still 100% relevant I think.<br /><br />While there are many books that may go into each topic specifically (such as time management or decision-making) I have not seen many other books that present as strong of a big picture snapshot of ALL of the key activities needed to be effective and how these might play together.<br /><br />There were also some tidbits here and there that I found to be very true.<br /><br />For example, the concept that a decision is not made until it has been effectively communicated to everyone in an organization that needs the information in order to carry it out and sustain it.  Although this seems obvious, there are people who may be \\"boundary conditions\\" as Drucker calls it - that do not execute the decision but still need to be aware of the decision so that they are not acting against the overall objective.  In my own line of work, directing my first project, this was actually something I had to consciously learn and reading this book put words to a concept I was aware of, but never could verbalize.<br /><br />Also the idea to create appropriate yardsticks and measure the results of decisions and hold them against the intended result is very reminiscent of six sigma practices that came up much later.  Good to see that this general practice is timeless.<br /><br />There was a lot of key thinking - especially as related to an organization - that I haven't seen in other places, especially regarding decision making.<br /><br />Some people may be put off by how general Drucker keeps the topic of discussion, but I think this does serve a purpose on keeping the concepts of the book at a big picture level which is good.<br /><br />I do feel that the book was lacking in specific practices related to time management.  This book would have received 5 stars if Drucker more clearly explained specific methods for managing time, as I think this is an especially difficult topic.  Instead he shrugs this off and encourages you to figure it out for yourself.  Well, I for one would have been curious as to the particular methods that some of the most effective executives that he interviewed in his consulting practice used to manage their time.<br /><br />One other word of warning - this is really a book for someone who has at some point worked in a somewhat large organization (i.e. at least 100 people).  If you have, much of what Drucker says will immediately 'click'.  If you haven't yet accumulated serious work experience, or have only worked in very small companies (10 people or less), you may not appreciate the full value of this book.<br /><br />A great read for anyone interested in increasing their personal and organization's effectiveness.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very detailed and addictive but a fun game to play. Not just for kids!!<br />Fun building your village and animal families...with all the different goals to achieve.<br /><br />Only thing it takes ages to pick up hearts
B00B49L7JY|5.0|very moving, interesting, and emotionally charged but in a uplifting sort of way. if you havent seen, give it a try. you'll be happy you did. quite the story. this man should have been a world renown IDOL,, amazing person, amazing singer. very connected, very selfless. very Zen.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Every woman should read this book (it wouldn't hurt men to read it either!) I want to give a copy to all the females in my life, but especially the young women.
B0041OT9W6|2.0|This book wasn't very good. Very boring and I couldn't make it through. Don't buy it, maybe if you are very into history, otherwise read something else
B007FC3AAI|3.0|the very first disc is the best but vampire movies and books should not be wrtten buy children,but by adults who study the topic.ever since i sew dracula in the early 40's i have baught all vampire novels by much better authers than her,like nancy collin etc.its children play...pluss the actors did a bad acting job......................ivan
0307720950|5.0|I attended the 3D printing conference in NYC.<br />This book is a great primer to understand what is going on in the field of 3D printing<br />This book should be read along with Fabricated: The new world od 3D printing
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|i enjoyed it but it kept most of lord of the rings characters,and made believe  thats what i was watching....i have the animated set<br />of dvd's and its not really not suppose to be the same........
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I felt like I was playing Diablo on an tablet. Id give this game 5 stars any day. Graphics are pretty good too. Gameloft made a great game!!!!!
B00881PTRC|5.0|Most hangman games I've tried don't allow you to use two player.  I love that option on this game since I can let my kids play together.  It's very stable - works on all 3 of our tablets, all of which are different makes and grades.
030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" has averaged 27 Amazon reviews a day since released in late March 2012. That's over 10,200 as of this moment and 24 yesterday, April 27. That means mine will be visible for about 6 hours so I'll keep my review brief.<br /><br />I read this book strictly because I had not seen a book with this many comments except for \\"Hunger Games\\" which does not interest me. I chose not to read any reviews ahead of time but did notice that it's roughly coming in at 3.75 stars which I think is good considering the number of contrarians on Amazon that look to counter any trend.<br /><br />My take? I enjoyed it. The story has many interesting twists. The marriage conflicts have more than a ring of truth and at times are uncomfortably realistic. It's just hyper real and witty enough to make it more interesting and smart than real life while clearly being grounded in 2012 America. I found myself easily immersed, sometimes laughing, often troubled and only occasionally predicting what lay ahead.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This app offers my children new ways to think.  My 7 year old came up with a design that I'd never seen before, and it held.  Love that this is a nice romp into engineering.  The kids version adds some fun options that the original did not have, including a small tutorial.  I'm amazed that my children will sit and play it for long stretches of time, including my 3 year old.  Can't think of anything better for them to &#34;waste&#34; their time on.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This has excellent performances, a witty, reversal-rich script, and a lot of all-around good fun.  Having Holmes as an Asperger's person is well done.  Updates often don't work, but this one certainly does.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|My husband and I decided to try and episode of Downton Abbey to see what all the rage was about. We have really enjoyed it and as members of Amazon Prime, could watch season 2 episodes for free. Several episodes have gotten within minutes of the ending, started buffering, and then close with an error message. We can close out of Prime and go back in to restart where we left off, but it is annoying. (we are watching on an IPad.

B0025KW29U|5.0|Our younger daughter and I were visiting her best friend, who lives about 2 and 1/2 hours away from us.  We were going to Disney World the next day.  But that night, the friend sat me down at her computer, accessed this movie, and said, &#34;Watch.&#34; Now, at the time, I was 63 years old, and not exactly up on modern popular culture.  Nor was I a particular fan of Neil Patrick Harris.<br /><br />This movie changed that last sentence.  He does an absolutely masterful job in this crazy film!  There was a writer's strike, and Joss Whedon was bored.  He and Harris got together and produced this as an independent film, just for laughs and something to do.  It went viral!  It has spawned all sorts of creativity -- go to YouTube and just type in &#34;my little bad horse&#34; and see what happens.<br /><br />I sat there in front of my daughter's friend's computer and laughed myself silly!<br /><br />You'll laugh yourself silly, too.  Bad Horse!
0316010669|3.0|Blink, like Gladwell's &#34;The Tipping Point,&#34; is very well written and many of the anecdotes and studies are quite interesting and informative.  Many of these studies show, however, how lousy our decisions are when we make snap judgements.  Just for example, the experts that interviewed and studied married couples and then followed them to check on the success (or not) of their unions.  The expert first opinions on the future success of the marriages were no better than the man in the street's until they studied the films &#34;frame by frame&#34; and made studious observations.  Only then did their &#34;snap judgements&#34; have some validity.  Other experts were shown to demonstrate an intuitive ability to make quick and accurate judgements about those things relevant to their expertise.  This should come as no surprise but it hardly supports &#34;the power of thinking without thinking&#34; - at least for the typical individual.<br /><br />A more enlightening and serious book on this subject, and one that comes to a completely different conclusion, is &#34;Thinking Fast and Slow.&#34;  This excellently researched book shows convincingly the awful decisions we often make without thinking.  There are so many human variables that influence (very often negatively) our &#34;gut feel&#34; decisions that a more thoughtful approach (&#34;system two thinking&#34;) to important decisions is almost always a better choice.<br /><br />Conclusion: Blink is a good and quick read, but I found its premise unconvincing and misleading.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|great show, Actors are great, especially Mellida and Alicia.  The show is very well scripted.  At some point she either needs to settle with her husband or divorce him.

0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call<br />By Adam Makos with  Larry Alexander<br /><br />I remember hearing about a badly shot up B-17 being escorted by a German fighter pilot in Bf-109. I never really followed up on it but when  I saw the book A Higher Call and was just intrigued by the cover. It is a painting showing a B-17 Bomber with a Bf-109 on his wing. Also on the cover is a picture of the two pilots of the planes one German and the other an American.<br />I had to read the book. The first thing you learn is the pilot of the American aircraft is  named Charlie Brown. Yes that is no typo. Brown tells the author Adam Makos that  to know the story you must know the story of the German pilot Franz Stigler. The author was taken aback by thatcomment as his job is recording stories of veterans from World War II. Why would Brown suggest he interview the enemy? Brown's only clue to was that Stigler was a man of great moral character. How could an enemy fighter pilot hold such a high respect of Charlie Brown?<br />The author started a dialogue with Franz and kept also keep in communication with Brown. This book took years to write as Makos would ask questions about both about  their home life, combat experience, and after the war.  The more questions he asked the more Makos wanted to know and he tried to make sure the stories were historically accurate.<br />The book tells the story of Franz and Brown as youth and how they came to fly and then to fight in combat. The story of the German Luftwaffe was unknown to me. Sure, I knew the German aircraft names and the controversial issue  of whether to call it a Bf-109 or Me-109 which was  the plane Stigler flew. I actually felt sorry for the German pilots and I don't say that lightly as my Cousin Bob Mawn was a nose gunner on B-17 and often a targets for the Germans. Makos tells the story about how Franz lost his brother and later his father later in the war.  The German Fighter Pilots had to fly till they died, were wounded, or promoted to a different post. The author starts the book by telling about Franz trying to a job after World War II. He could not  as the German people blamed the fighter pilots because for they could not stop the allies and their planes from bombing the German homeland.<br />It is a fascinating story when you learn that the Luftwaffe pilots considered Goring a fat  joke. The author puts you into their boots. Many story that are told that you have to take time to digest and think  about.  One thing I learned is for most of the war the Luftwaffe pilots did not use the Hitler salute with the stretched arm until late in the war as ordered by Hitler. There are countless stories and Franz and Charlie's reunion close to 60 years after the war is unbelievable.<br />Ironically they both died in 2009 and I regret I never met both of them. This book is a easy to read as well fascinating and would make a good movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's pretty poorly written for a bestseller. I was very disappointed with the ending. Also, not my personal book genre preference overall.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is quite fun indeed.  The gameplay is quite amazing along with the interface.  A useful tip for the game is definitely to tap less.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Awesome movie, it should has won more than two Oscars. A little bit exagerated shootings and blood baths. Love it!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I thought this book was just okay. Sometimes it's hard to understand what exactly is going on, and it gets a bit drawn out in the middle.
B00881VLCE|2.0|While I really enjoyed doing the puzzles and there was a wide variety of puzzles for free and even more for purchase, I was unable to play most times.The game wouldn't load and I would have a blank screen. I would have to uninstall the app and re-install it in order to be able to play.<br />I was quite disappointed by this as the picture were great and the choices of puzzles six was also wonderful, but if a person has to go through the process of uninstalling and then reinstalling each time, it's just not worth it.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Dubbed version ? Quality of picture was ok .Dubbed version before  streaming should be in stated ,lettering on screen was annoying.
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|After seeing SO many great reviews about this book, I felt like there must be something wrong with me as I trudged through it, waiting for some kind of light at the end of the tunnel. While, yes, it is written clearly and honestly, I didn't find any reason to justify the time it took me to read. The character is somewhat sympathetic but not enough to be likeable in the end.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|The movie quality, as always from amazon, was excellent. The movie itself was a little slow for my taste but I know plenty of other people who like it so give it a try!

B008PUF3VS|4.0|While not the best written story, it is a compelling story that over comes its writing. A recommended read for those who want to see the camps through the innocent eyes of two young boys in very different situations.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Great flick for those who want to understand that politics and political maneuevering were just as importantly screwed up 150 years ago as they are today. Otherwise, it's slow.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I remember this being on TV but was only able to catch a few episodes. I didn't know at that time that it was a spin off of Dr Who. I just thought it was a cool show about time travel, aliens, and other strange happenings. Which is the type of things I like a lot. It can be a little bit Graphic at times, which I don't like but I still loved the series. Oh and at least you actually get to see the monsters / aliens and what not. I do not like when shows or even movies do not show the monster / alien.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game so much its so funbto change their hair and make it look cool or however youbwant.

B00CHI5B7A|2.0|For one, Sean Penn is not a believable villain in this film. His orange, spray on tan is distracting too. The writing lacked depth and did not draw me in whatsoever. Overall predictable and seems to be a tremendous waste of such a great cast. I'd avoid this flick.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|This was for my grandson and he loves it. The Kindle actually locks into place and stays there. It came packed well.
B0035JRVBO|4.0|I won't say much about the movie, since it is quite well known. I found it a bit too sentimental. We saw it on our home PC using Amazon's movie streaming service, which worked quite well.
034537410X|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books. Everyone needs to buy and read this book. If you are not familiar with the concept of lucid dreams, this will answer all your questions. This is based on scientific research and not a lot of the hokey new age concepts you find in other lucid dreaming books. This is also NOT about dream interpretation but rather a simple, easy, and clear strategy to control your dreams. The \\"MILD\\" and \\"WILD\\" techniques can get you started the first day. This influenced me in ways that I never imagined, and I have since influenced others based on its concepts. It's also a good strategy to tap into some of the creative aspects for people who are artists, writers, and engineers. This is a must read and a must try.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Took me thru some of the politics, and efforet involved. The movie was enjoyable, informative, and had me appreciative of the efforts of some in sticking to their guns.
0064404994|5.0|This was an excellent fantasy book. I still have memories of Turkish Delight from this book. The movie simply did not do this book justice. Strong religious overtones with underlying metaphors of self sacrifice.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great series - seems like you're right there in the 8th century! Love the scenery, the fjords, etc. And the story line is excellent!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I am having a great time playing booty quest.  it is very fast paced game and keeps your interest for a good while.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Although an excellent DVD, I wish it had been filmed without the live audience. The cameras can do more without the interferring with the paying public. Sound can also improve.
B00384N5GQ|5.0|I use this movie in my principles of health science classroom to illustrate how schizophrenia affects the patient and the family. awesome teaching tool
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Didn't know this kind of music was available to the public. I have music on all the time and this CD makes the top of the list.
B007G92QGO|3.0|This was a good book but a hard read at times and that's more to do with the subject matter than how its written.  Definitely worth a read.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|I thought this move was visually stunning and had plenty of action. But the storyline was confusing for many, that multiple views of the film was the only way to find out what happened and why.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It is fun and helps to pass the time for the grandkids and they really seem to enjoy playing it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was coerced into seeing this film and was very happy. It is sad, funny & emotional. And can't believe a lot really went on back then.
0062059963|4.0|What I Loved: I was so excited to read this, especially having just read The Prince (novella) and The Selection days before but I'll be honest, this was one of the most stressful books I've read in a long time. The Elite picks up right where The Selection leaves off and we find America still struggling with her feelings for both Aspen and Prince Maxon (as was I) as tension among the other girls continues to rise and the danger the rebels pose becomes more real.<br /><br />Like it's predecessors, this is beautifully written and Kiera Cass has done a fabulous job of creating a world that looks modern but employs some rather old and at times, barbaric practices and the predicament the three main characters are in is the epitome of \\"love triangle\\". *whimpers*<br /><br />I like that consequences are shown even if the severity of those consequences seemed harsh at times. The romance between America and Prince Maxon feels relateable because it's not an easy one. There are other people's feelings to consider as well as insecurities on both sides and my heart broke for both of them. I really wanted them to make different choices because really, I JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY!<br /><br />With all that is going on, America begins to realize that there's more to the Selection then just winning Maxon or a crown, and she'll have to decide how best to use the position she's been put in, even if it means losing.<br /><br />What left me wanting: I like both of these male characters but I also wanted to grab them and shake them quite a few times. I love Prince Maxon and I realize the whole process is new to him but I still wish he'd made better choices, been more open with America. He talks about trust, but trust works both ways. And Aspen, we all know you screwed up in the tree house but it takes time to fix stuff like that - a simple apology just won't cut it.<br /><br />Final verdict: Excellent sequel and I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Obviously we know the Phantom survived at the end of Phantom... this fills in all the other details whether it was needed or not.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie drew me in and was quite suspenseful and powerfully emotional.  There were no slow moments and I really loved how well the mid 70's cars, phones, hair, etc. was done.  I thought they did a great job with the movie and was very enjoyable.
B000UNYK3A|5.0|Even though it is scary and gory, it is done in such a way that we hope this is just imagination - or is it?
B000W223GK|5.0|Unique style.  When ever there are brothers in the band, the vocal harmonies grab you.  The dual lead guitar harmonies are great.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|I think that 7 SAW movies is enough and this chapter hopefully ends it. It's predictable and not as many twists.
B005OTGS08|5.0|anthing with sean bean is top-notch.  would recommend to anybody who enjoys his work and the time period.  always the best.
0393312836|4.0|Someone else needs to make this movie again like they did with The Shining. They need to stay closer to the book!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I can say its ok but I cant find watermelons or red flower why say its in the game if you cant find it but the game it ok add more things and make you run faster and maybe a villages and villagers yeah that will be GREAT.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Enjoyed the book to the point I have already ordered the next in the series. I would have given it a higher rating, but I had difficulty initially keeping track. The book changes people from chapter to chapter as there are multiple stories going on at the same time. As it progressed it got easier. I am looking forward to start the next in the series.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a hard read because it's basically a bunch of interviews put together. The picture that it painted was great though, especially for zombie enthusiasts who are preparing for an attack!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first Jillian Michaels workout and certainly won't be my last. This is really great workout. I began adding it to my routine five days a week. I didn't really have high expectations since it's only a twenty minute workout. However, by week two, I noticed real results. My arms feel a lot stronger, and Jillian is a great motivator. There are even changes in my core. Going to buy more of her!
B0076DELIG|4.0|It's nice that Harry and I are aging together.  Of course, I'm aging faster than he is, but his maturity makes him a more complex character.
0345803485|5.0|A must read for any woman or man who wishes to tap into their sensuality... fantastic, erotic and pleasurable reading.  I recommend this book highly...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved Mockingjay.  I saw the Hunger Games Movie and remarked to my Grandaughter that I really liked it.  She told me that I needed to read the books, they were better.  I started with The Hunger Games then moved rapidly through the other two books.  Suzanne Collins is a stupendous writer.  I would love to read more books of this quality.  I had fun discussing them with my 15 year old grandaughter.
1452113432|5.0|This book is great!  I watch her shows (wish there were more) she is likeable, fun and a wonderful cook.  Her recipes never fail to please everyone in my family.<br /><br />This is a great book, a must have for any home cook.  This was a wonderful purchase.  I look forward to purchasing more of her books in the future.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|This movie was pretty funny! It kept hubby and I laugh out loud. Light hearted easy to follow. It was a good late night pick
9889979942|4.0|I first heard about this book when I came across Donald Trump's list of favorite books about China. It was the only photography book in his list. When I learned that Tom Carter didn't use a fancy camera to capture all of China's 30+ provinces along with the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, I was stunned. The quality of the photos is top notch. Clear, crisp, and telling. Each province or special administrative region is introduced with a travelogue-essay, an interview with someone Carter met in his travels throughout China, or with a poem. Not all of the photos include a caption, which would be a daunting task for 800+ photos, but most include a concise description. This compact size makes this an easy book to transport, unlike the standard coffee table book.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|It was a pretty good movie just not a great pick for 10:30 at night. I just couldn't stay awake
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was sweet and cute but a little to short ! I wish it had another chapter it kind of left me hanging but still an all around good book !
B00BSBY38A|1.0|This movie drags on and on and on and on... How many minutes of Pi in a boat do we have to see before we get the point that being lost at sea is awful! I should have known if the critics loved it I'd hate it. It is a disjointed movie with potential but in the end nothing more than confusion and a realization that 2 hours of your life has been lost.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire<br />I did not expect to like this trilogy as I thought it was meant for teens.  They held my interest completely  I read them so quickly I had to promise my friends not to talk about them, so as not to reveal any plot
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Missed this movie in the theater, so decided to purchase it. Great cast and fun dialogue. Harrison Ford keeps better and better.
B0089XH38M|4.0|I appreciate the free coverage.  They take a while to update as you sign on.  I found the ipad version much easier to set up than the computer version.
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|I love this film because of all the memories. I raced desert and Moto Cross in California from 1972 to 1977 when I moved to WI with Harley Davidson. I had initially been the Account Executive on the Yamaha motorcycle account with two Los Angeles advertising agencies and this is what got me in to racing. I met Malcolm Smith and Steve McQueen once at the Indian Dunes MX track. A friend and I had been play racing when those two got on the track. The blew us away and in a short time were about to lap us. I signaled me friend to get of the track and we waited until they got off. Who are these guys? We went over to meet them and recognized them when they took off their helmets. I was with Yamaha and Harley Davidson for nearly ten years. After my racing days I became an avid street rider and rode across America for the HD 75th Anniversary. Too many other memories to recount here, but if you want to know the way racing was in the 1970's this is the film. It is wonderful and a must see!

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|\\"House of Cards\\" centers around the political scenarios of  power couple  Francis Underwood and Claire Underwood (played in a convincing way by Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright). The character of Francis Underwood stops at nothing  to achieve his career ambitions and does not hesitate to do so at the expense of other people. The Netflix picture where his hand is covered in blood is very fitting for the series.  The character of Francis Underwood does the narration and even justifies one of his schemes by saying that all people eventually die anyhow. The narration shown in \\"House of Cards\\" is considered breaking the fourth wall. My husband noted that technique when he was glancing over some of the scenes in \\"House of Cards\\". The character of Claire Underwood is not a shrinking violet either. One of her subordinates finds this out when Claire Underwood confronts the worker about challenging the agency. This series is good for those who like to watch political thrillers set in the Washington D.C. area.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I may be biased as Russel Crowe is one of my favorite male actors and the film score to the movie was hands down amazing.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|\\"Merlin Season Five\\" definitely ends differently than I expected. However, I can see why it ended the way it did in keeping with the series theme. The bonuses included on this dvd collection are the deleted scenes, outtakes, making of Merlin, and the storyboards (where different sketches of the Merlin scenes are displayed). \\"Merlin Season Five\\" is great for those who have watched any of the other Merlin Seasons and for those who enjoy watching fantasy themed television.

But the root message is always the same.  mankind should not be underestimated and are capable of achieving three things.  no matter how big the no matter how big problem everything can be overcome without violence

B00CDT41RY|1.0|Tarantino's movie Django is a phony farce that's not worth the time and trouble of watching. Despite all the hoopla surrounding this film, one has to paraphrase Orwell's dictum that there are ideas--read movies--so out of wack and far fetched that only an &#34;intellectual&#34;--read fancy over-educated movie critics--would believe in them. Same here. The movie tries to be so out of the box and pretentious that the admirers of Tarantino think that this film is so crazy it must be great. However, the average, half-educated viewer with half a brain would see the movie for what it is: an overly long, catoonish, foul-mouthed, disjointed, depressing depiction attempt by a fairly good film-maker who can be clever and entertaining when he wants to be. It's not the case here.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We loved it! Something for everyone. My 10 yr old daughter watches over and over again.Great father/daughter theme that is touching.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|This movie is worth seeing but probably better for older children.  Be sure to have the kleenex handy for the ending.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|If you loved Coraline, you won't be disappointed. My daughter loves these type of animated movies that explore a different side of a child's imagination like Monster House, Coraline or Nightmare Before Christmas.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This is a movie for all time.  Just showed it to my students with intellectual disabilities and they loved it! One was singing Chim-cher-Cheeree on his way to the bus that afternoon.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I've been a huge fan of Crichton's since high school, so it was with great excitement that I stumbled upon his last novel, completed, very similar to his style.<br /><br />It was a strong novel, that fit neatly into his techno-thriller niche, and above all, it kept me guessing as to how things would turn out, especially when characters really began getting picked off.  Very realistic in this, but yet it kept me engaged.  The tech was solid, the premise was very Crichton-esque and I was pleased overall with my purchase.<br /><br />If you liked Crichton's similar previous efforts, Jurassic Park or Congo, you would definitely like this one!
1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending a King~ His Life & Legacy\\" gives a very sightful view on the real Michael Jackson. I was completey astonished by the facts the author gave about Michael, to the heart warming facts about him and his children, to the the 2005 trials. I have been a fan for a long time, and I never heard any of the facts, and information that I was given in this book. If you want the full out truth on Michael Jackson, his life, his family, his career, and the children he helped etc. This book is it!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|i liked all the songs in this cd.  some i had never heard before and i'm glad i bought it.
B00756GRUE|5.0|This watch was one of the watches that I have all ways wanted. So please pass it on to others.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|i think this is the best of the series.  the extra minutes were amazing and made the movie better than we saw in the theater.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|Of all the movies I have watched the first are always the better movie. Now with another G.I. Joe movie coming out ,then I believe that this one will be the BEST!!!!
B003B02O14|5.0|Definitely a book you can visit over and over again. I've never been a huge John Grisham fan but this is absolutely his best book. The story pulls you in within the first couple of pages, and leaves you on the edge of the seat till the end. It's a must read!
B0053O89U6|5.0|This show gets better with every season!  The writers are fantastic and the comedy is hilarious.  The child actors have great comedic timing and expressions, especially the character of Luke.  This guy is hilarious.  We can watch these episodes over and over again and laugh as hard as we did the first time.  Can't wait for Season Four!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A very cool game with cool graphics. You'll be running around, so get the map. Use the monkey for those hard to reach 'll places. I would recommend this game.
B008CRC506|4.0|Really love Season One of Smash.  Can't take it too seriously, but the characters are quirky and enjoyable to watch.  Music and choreography are entertaining.  An added plus is the show is a new idea and not a copycat of another popular series.  I doubt it will last more than 4 seasons, but I like watching it for the entertainment value.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I can honestly say that I am addicted to reading this series of books.  This book did not dissapoint me - as with the previous book in the series I was unable to put it down and kept wanting to snatch 15 mins here & there to get through the next chapter. Really loved it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Great Arcade game. I love the combination of all the greats. I highly recommend this game to everyone I know
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|So glad I gave this game a try! Great fun solo or with others. Really easy rules but the game does get difficult. My four year old can play on easy, and we even played as family last night.<br />Happy to have snagged it for free, but would gladly pay for this game.<br />Well worth it !
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Could not get my Visual Land Tablet to work with kindle for Android, so therefore, could not open the book.  So I guess I hate it.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|It brings you right back to the movie.  Every scene is as vivid as if you were sitting home and watching it again!
0316067598|5.0|This book describes in detail the training and the hazards the Seals go through.  It is a must read for anyone wanting to know more about what is REALLY happening in the mid-east countries and how the people feel about us.  I am sure this is only the tip of our/their relations.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Very bad film. Amateurish poorly acted, jumbled, black & white, altogether a waste of time. Whoever paid to have this made???
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I just like Fringe. It's a series ihave watched and enjoyed. A bit far fetched but enjoyable. Like I could watch it without commercials.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like most of Grisham's books, I can't wait to get to the end.  This was no different. A great story with amazing twists!  Another winner!
B000SP1SEO|4.0|This was the second time I have seen the movie,  Snatch.  It was even better than the first time. The story is actually quite humorous,  even though the plot is dark and dangerous.  The characters are cast perfectly and Brad Pitt,  even though not one of my favorites,  does an excellent job and is convincing.<br /><br />Have fun.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I find it very informative and I like how it summarizes to an extent the information that it is presenting
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF ALL THE MAYHEM IN THE PRESS AND THE SALES LEVELS, AND I ADMIT , BECAUSE BEING CURIOUS ON WHETHER AS A MALE I WOULD BE EXITED BY IT.<br />THE ANSWER WAS NO.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I forget to use it and would question if I would re-subscribe in the future as I am 80 years old and not up on the new gadgets
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|TYPICAL CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS BOOK ALTHOUGH ONE STARTS READING WITH THE IDEA &#34;HERE&#34;S MORE OF THE SAME&#34; THE AUTOR SUCCEEDS AFTER A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS TO SUCK THE READER INTO HIS TYPICAL FRENZY OF ACTION, DETAILED KNOWLEDGE AND MEANNESS.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely love this show! Best show on TV now! Watch the first season & you'll be hooked fast. Can't wait to watch the 4 the season.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I READ THE BOOKIN A COUPLE OF DAYS, NOT USUAL FOR ME. THERE IS A CONSTABT SENSE OF FEAR , BETRAYAL, WITHIN A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EASY TO GRASP AS BEING TYPICAL VILAINS AND GOOD ONES
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Have read all three of the books and this is the best one of all.  Couldn't put it down!  Too bad there won't be a book four.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I rated it 4 stars because I liked it when it was working, but it doesn't work anymore, gets stuck on the first screen.  But the game was fun before when I could get in.  I have since deleted it, because it doesn't work anymore.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Pretty good. I usually don't like horror films rooted in dark metaphysics but they pulled this one off. Solid cinematography, good plot, good characters.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have fun playing with this game and styling the hair. Funnest game ever! But I wish you could change their eye color.
B001O1O71C|4.0|I had to read this book for a book report at school, and i am happy with the assignment. I very much enjoyed this book and i am looking forward to reading the next.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I was thinking because Matt was in here this would be an awesome movie! I typically love Matthew's movies and his characters...this movie however was garbage, big disappointment.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My granddaughter wanted to watch it and loved it so much watch it there times that night.  This movie my kids used to watch when they were young as well.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I love Volbeat but I love Volbeat with the new guitarist even more.The riffs are awesome,this is a great record.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really enjoyed Lean In. Great book for men and women.  Sandberg includes lots of insights, interesting data, and practical advice.
B009UKUGXC|5.0|Simon Singh creates a very interesting story of obsession and sheer genius. I couldn't put this book down. He has brought an obscure topic to a mainstream audience in a delightful way.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|I got irritated with this game pretty quickly when the steering controls didn't always take the vehicle in the direction indicated. However I have to admit I had reservations about the app when the description said I could park a &quot;standard saloon.&quot; Even in this world of texting &amp; tweeting we need to be aware of what we type.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent testimony to the questions of life after death.I would recommend it to everyone. It was an awesome , faith-inspiring book.
1469984202|5.0|Mr. Howey has re-kindled my interest in reading science fiction again. I am looking forward to his next novel!<br />One more word?!??!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Read the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and consumed the sequel in a matter of days. Great ending can't wait to read the next book.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|One of the best movies, ever.  Ryan Gosling is superb and so are all the stars.  Great love story.  Loved it.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I have nothing to say about the music. The historical and musical importance of this album is very well documented.<br />I only want to say that I purchased this RTI 180 gram edition because my copy of the 50th Anniversary blue Vinyl edition SUCKS! It had some bubbles and lesions and  in the crucial parts of the music too!! Very annoying.<br /><br />But this edition is PERFECT!! Truly premium quality vinyl that is almost CD quiet. Worth it.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Amazing!!!! I love this book so much &#60;3 great plot!! Great storyline! Great everything!!! I absolutely love this book so muck'
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The case is a very well made product.  It is much better than the products available from the local stores for the Kindle Fire.
B0016492BW|5.0|What else can be said aside from the title of the movie.  Except that if you haven't ever seen this movie than shame on you.  You should buy it now before it becomes illegal.  Trust in me humour is the next of your rights to go out the window.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good adaptation of the book. Was very good to be to see the visualization of the novel. Looking forward to the follow ups.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|almost impossible to believe, how could they portray children and adults in a way to show them so irresponsible, dumb, unethical and quasi child pornographic in a comedy (?) set up,  whats is going on with the majority of the people ? is this our new standard ?  to  have the lowest of  expectations in the new generation ?.....
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Excellent acting; they picked people with physical bodies where one can believe they are climbing and straining to do the work and daily efforts performed in a magnificent but difficult terrain.<br /><br />Typical of real life, no matter where it is lived, the story portrays not always courage with triumph, but failure, greed, stupidity, power gone mad. ignorance - but, again, lessons in simple justice, sharing, innocent joy and we see  true events of heroism we often miss to see that come  from gentle, simple people of all types of faith.<br /><br />Well done movie; entertaining throughout.
B004YF6MHW|1.0|Don't waste your time with this app. Doesn't work. Nothing but a green smudge appears when you take a picture.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I am so attided.pop rob look I'm awesome da . You can change your guy and get new updates so fun.
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|one of my favorite Electropop bands for 2013. beautiful tracks. I love all the tracks and especially Harvest moon, Next to You, Take Me Home,  and Do You Believe (also download the remix of this track). beautiful pop melodies that will become classics.
B008LSVLZG|5.0|Been a fan for about ten years. Primarily Porcupine Tree's music, but have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD of SW's work with other band members. His musical talent really knows no bounds.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My cousin showed me this game and I thought it was just a stupid game then I deleted it after a few months. Then I got bored with Sims and said, Let's try DragonVale then I did and instantly falling in love with it, it's freaking addicting!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I like this case. It took me a couple of tries to figure it out. I had forgotten about the hand-hold which ideal for reading in bed. I probably use the stand the most because I read at lunch time. The ability to spin to horizontal or vertical for the kindle to stand is handy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game. I can't stop playing it after a month! It is the best game ever and its free!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have the Scribblenauts version for my 3DS but I didn't bring it on a trip. I found an email that Amazon sent letting me know the new deals and apps for my kindle. I saw that this was only $.99 and got real excited, downloaded it right away and played it for most of the trip we took. I even played it in the waiting room waiting for my nails to get done. Pretty close to the gaming console versions and pretty cool.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I own and have watch all the bond movies and this is one of the best due to it highlighting bonds and m's characters and regard for each other.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|We didn't even finish watching it. It was terrible! I would ask for my money back if I had gone to the theater to see it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a well done, thought provoking movie.  It was hard to watch at times since one felt such empathy for the well defined characters.  I had avoided it and finally decided to watch it.  This was certainly food for thought.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I love this movie, I think I've seen in at least 5 times, twice in the theatre.  But I was disappointed in the 3D effects on my own TV.
B0095P31L6|4.0|What a fun movie to watch!  The satire and parody on westerns was well done and the graphics are spectacular.  The music and background voices were first rate.  This movie is easy to watch and quite entertaining.  Yes, I may watch it again.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I'm still singing the songs to myself. It is very cute, love the message, and it was played out nicely.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I've grown up with Star Wars, so this was a treat for me to be able to get these versions on blue-ray for an affordable price.
B008602KQI|3.0|the effects are great, but the telling of the story is not.<br />I have not a chance yet to read the original novel on which the movie is based.<br />don't know if the original story itself is hard to tell or if it's too complicated to be fit in one movie.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is pretty cool to play with; sounds really good.  Something different to play with to pass the time. I recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Temple Run 2 is a great hit with my granddaughter who loves to play games on my KindleFire when she's visiting with me.  She finds it exciting as she advances through the levels.  I'm amazed how fast she goes through all the obstacles!  She's 7 and I can't begin to move as fast as she can.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|this movie brings history to life.  Excellent performance by Daniel Day Lewis!  I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Civil War.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My granddaughter really likes to play this game with me. I read it and she listens and does what I tell her to do.
B00881PTRC|4.0|sadly, the fonts and colors used made the game almost unplayable.  And if there were any word clues, I couldn't see them. The game would be better if colors and fonts (or at least sizes) could be set. The game would be great if skill levels, especially for kids, could be set too
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Great special effects raised this review up to two stars, but I gotta tell ya folks, when the idiot scientist tried to pet the totally creepy and menacing looking alien snake my BS meter went off the scale. Not a single thing in this movie makes any sense. Nothing anyone says or does makes sense. It was almost as if the characters had agreed to look at every situation from all angles, pick the dumbest course of action and go for it. If we're that stupid by the year 2095 the universe may be better off if the creators had been successful in destroying us or we get wiped out by an asteroid first. Some movies are so stupid they're good. This one doesn't quite make it. The characters suck. The plot and writing sucks. The last one minute or so is OK because it hints at Alien, but aside from that and the special effects, totally pointless.
B007P6VM4A|4.0|RECENTLY SAW THEM OPEN FOR PINK AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.A REALLY FUN BAND WHO DO NOT LACK IN CONFIDENCE...THEIR MUSIC IS PRETTY GOOD ALSO.
B008602KQI|1.0|This movie sucked. Whoever dreamed up this book and move has a depraved mind. I would never recommend this movie or the book to anyone. I regret the time wasted watching it.
B00454U1NS|5.0|SO MUCH GOOD MUSIC SO QUICKLY.SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST 3 FEMALE RECORDING ARTISTS OUT THERE TODAY.HER LIVE SHOW,IN MY OPINION,THE BEST.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Awesome best note app ever, work really good without problems. And the best part you can block it with a password!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an amazing ending to the trilogy. I couldn't stop reading till I got to the end. Love this series. I'm just as  that it ha  to end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it I love playing solitaire it's one of my favorite card games .It's fun to try to beat your time each time or to beat someone else
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is another book that has been monumental in my marriage and family.  This has shown me how I should not only love my wife but also my children.  Guys if you hate to read.... get over it.  Pick this book up read it and learn how to love your wife.
B000G8NXYG|4.0|Great movie set to the time period enjoyed the authentic costumes an action an later on the interviews on the 3rd disc
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I enjoy the fast pace and grown-up nature of this show. It deals with issues that, while often show their age, still speak to the ills of our society, and often even the world, and it manages to accomplish this without either becoming an over-stylized action show or bogging down in righteous self-reflection. The camera work is a bit inconsistant, which is sometimes fitting and other times jarring. I think it works over all, but it probably is a matter of personal taste.<br />One slight disappointment is the lack of a back story in the first season. It's there in the second season, but it feels a little too late, and at that point it feels like filler.<br />All in all, a very strong and enjoyable first season. I'm very glad this show is finally available through Amazon Prime, and look forward to the other seven seasons.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This recommended software for downloading Mp3 music from Amazon has been wonderfully easy to use.  I have been very pleased.
B00B4804KS|5.0|As one of my favorite movies, I have been patiently waiting for the 3D release.  All I can say is that I am blown away!  The conversion looks better than some movies that have been natively shot in 3D.  I knew Spielberg wouldn't let me down.  Watching it in 3D certainly adds a whole new dimension to a classic movie.  The depth is incredible and makes you feel that you are there.  There's also many scenes that have objects that pop out of the screen and into your living room.<br /><br />But no blockbuster such as this is complete without blockbuster sound and the DTS 7.1 soundtrack is unbelievable.  The combination of picture and sound is awesome.  This is the way, Jurassic Park was meant to be seen.  If you are a fan of the movie, you must get this 3D version of this disc.  In fact, if you are a fan of this movie and don't have a 3D TV, get one now and enjoy the movie.  All in all, well done and a stellar conversion.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Will Rogers has been quoted many times saying, &#34;If you don't like the weather in Oklahoma, just wait a minute.&#34;
B007SGLZP8|4.0|L liked this book because  it kept my interest from  start to finish. I was recomended this book from a friend who knows I  like John  Grisham books.You were never sure who was the bad guys. Read this book in three days.
B00000251N|5.0|I loved this music since it was first released and still do.  I did an online search and Amazon is where I finally found it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I laughed and cried, mostly cried. It was beautifully written and the ending was moving, to say the least.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I had watched the episodes from the beginning of the season, but sadly missed the final episode.  As an avid fan, after my purchase I got to see the last episode.
B00633W614|1.0|Tried to persist with the second book but you have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters that buying the third book is a definite no no.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|When I found this software and downloaded, I thought I was getting another place to store music.  I got a wonderful surprise !!  I have listened to a rare variety of sound programming and online talk shows.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is a time waster for me. It  is boring and I don 't enjoy the  game. My grandchildren do play  however.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Love it!<br />Defiantly a great read. Great story line and is easy to read. Good price. Read it!<br />Enjoy cheers
B009LMTDL0|5.0|and she said it very well. Thank You for reminding us of our power .This should be required reading for all highschool girls
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This app is great and is a big help for times that I need access to my computer at home. I also have it installed on my laptop. Using the app on the kindle is a challenge due to the way the cursor works without a mouse and takes some getting use to. But, in a pinch, it is fine. I can get to the files or programs that I need. I love it. Compared to GoToMy PC, it is better.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great original show! Tom and his sons are my favorite. Each episode keeps you wanting to know more. Can't wait for the third season!
B006YC74E8|1.0|I accessed the Kindle app store via my Kindle Fire and downloaded this app.  It doesn't do anything.  I just saw that it's for an Android, not a Kindle.  Well, why is it in the Kindle store??
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I was referred to this book by a friend who is a fan of John Grisham,  I purchased this  book and immediately started reading it.  The first three chapters were interesting, but once the main character started his journey I became bored with the story and had difficulty keeping interested.  I am now up to chapter 40, and I am forcing myself to continue just because I spent money for it, and I hate to feel that I have wasted my money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book. I liked how it went back and forth between the characters and it was a good story, but I wasn't thrilled with the ending.<br /><br />I was left feeling like ......that's it??
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James really knows how to write a girl's fantasy.<br />Good writer. I cried a few times reading it.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This was a very intense movie that grips your attention from beginning to end. It is a true story, and it is very heartwarming and inspirational too.

1432794426|5.0|This author did an outstanding job of portraying Michael Jackson's true life. He was not the man the media and tabloids portrayed him to be. Michael's life was full of struggles, but the real human being was never exposed...until now. MJ had the sweetest soul, was the most giving humanitarian and had a heart of gold. This author should be commended on writing such an honest portrayal of the King's life.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I'm not a writer but a reader but I found his &#34;lessons&#34; on writing very interesting.  Makes you aware of both good and bad writing as you read
B00CDT41RY|5.0|would recommend it to adults not small children--to gory and violent--Jamie Foxx did a great job in his role in this movie.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The alternate dimension is so close but not exactly. This show really makes you think about the multiple dimension question. Infinite dimensions with infinite variables. so there would be a 1 in infinite chance to have an identical you.
0345529057|5.0|Reasonably priced and amazing books. I've been meaning to pick them up and now the wife and I can enjoy the books the series is based on.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I love the ease of use, the ability to change the appearance, and the available widgets.  It is also very easy to share it across multiple outlets.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app.  I use it to help me get the best battery life on my kindle fire hd.
B002PNER9U|1.0|Just thought it was boring and the singers were not that good.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

1455523003|5.0|In the 80s and early to mid 1990s, Mother Teresa was upheld as a paragon of virtue and compassion. The truth, however, was quite different and far more unsettling, as Hitchens revealed through his exemplary research and journalistic acumen. Although Teresa's \\"charity\\" obtained many hundreds of millions, hardly anything was spent on alleviating suffering (which is, by definition, the end goal of compassionate individuals). Where did the money go instead? On nunneries, bibles and efforts to convert the poor, sick and dying in impoverished nations. This makes perfect sense in light of some of her quotes, now infamous, which include:<br /><br />\\"I think it is very good when people suffer. To me, that is like the kiss of Jesus.\\" (Needless to say, this was not taken well by the object of her quote)<br /><br />\\"But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? ... By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And, by abortion, that father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. The father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.\\" As if slaughtering children and grown adults (a by-product of poverty and overpopulation) was somehow less harmful, or that fertilised eggs are somehow morally equivalent to newborn babies.<br /><br />As Hitchens eloquently states, women who have abortions do not see themselves as murderers, and they do not go on to commit murder because of the initial abortion.<br /><br />Almost as disturbing are the secret records that were never made public. This is also understandable in hindsight, but it also puts her ghoulish activities on par with Enron's scandal (which resulted in negligent deaths) and Charles Keating, a convicted fraud who robbed the innocent and gullible. Ever the epitome of poverty's contagion, \\"Mother\\" Teresa apparently felt as though she needed to spread more misery and suffering around while using the money to continue propping up the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Along with Hitchens' companion piece, Hell's Angel, I would recommend this book unequivocally. This expose is one of the most important pieces of journalistic integrity ever made.g are the secret records that were never made public.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|good to keep u busy even if you only have a few min. love the horses but hats the adds in this app. there a real pain.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Dexter without the touchy-feely angles. Liked it and especially James Purefoy. Brilliant casting. Playing against Kevin Bacon works. Even the crazy premise works.
B001KR9AP8|2.0|Theres only 11 tracks and their split up on 2 different records. Why? They couldnt put them all on 1 record? I cant say I really like this album cause Ive never been much of a Beyonce fan.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|This show was unexpected. I figured it would be same old, same old...lot of violence, but essentially boring. It actually was not at all. I enjoyed the series a lot. Good casting and good storylines kept the momentum going.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved this movie so much.  I hated to see the cruelty the slaves endured, but I had to face the reality that it did happen.  I loved the idea of an intelligent slave, after all his suffering, being so strong.  ( I hope I didn't put in any spoiler.)  My props to the director and writer, Quentin, for his ingenious work.  I love this man's intelligence!  I loved the fantastic actors during what they do best.  I cannot say anything bad about this movie.  It will always be one of my very favorite movies.  It's good to know that, as my Mom always says:  \\"Every dog has it's day.\\"  lol  Goodness always prevails.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I love Downton Abbey. We love to see the costumes, the cars but most of all the stories. Something is always going on and it is so much fun to watch it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and it is free so you should get it there are a lot of missions to do and you can fight or friend other players
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Ok I have to first say I loved this book. I can't get the characters out of my head. The plot and story was quite different from what I'm used to reading. I didn't fall immediatly in love with the book and at times I had to force myself to keep reading but the story did pick up towards the middle and then I couldn't put the book down.
B003U53GK8|3.0|I'm originally from Hawaii. I now live on the east coast. I never watched \\"lost\\"when i lived in Honolulu & because I'm homesick i figured I'd give it a try. The first the seasons were good.the last three were a challenge for me to get through. It actually became a chore. The story wears thin in the last three seasons.  I didn't like the way it ended. I thought it was a let down after all the time invested in watching the show. The only way i was able to keep watching was to play an episode while on the treadmill & run until the episode finished.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|LOVE this new album by Michael Buble! Love the older style of the songs as well as covers of some all time favorites! Always a fan of Michael Buble!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fun!!!!!!!!! played for hours. late for school next day. highly recomend had a great time everyone should try it start early
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|This album gets better every time I listen to it! Blake Shelton is OUTSTANDING!! Not a single bad song on this album! Why haven't you bought it yet? Stop reading and buy it NOW!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I enjoyed it. Will continue with the series. Reacher is a fresh version of  your everyday hero, trained to beat just about anyone.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Is a singer of great depth and clarity. She lifts your soul as she sings and takes you on a journey. This is one of her best albums to date !!!!!
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Great series along the lines of Walt Longmire. Got  hooked on the series after catching an episode on the tube.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Do not download!! After installing and signing in to facebook my kindle immediately shutdown and restarted with an &#34;update&#34;  I have applications running in the background I've never seen before, office suites and dictionary's I never paid for. It shuts down and powers itself on now. Obviously being accessed by an unauthorized remote user via our wireless network.
B000FA675C|4.0|Good story, well written, absorbing and entertaining.  Fast paced and complex, I look forward to reading more books by this author.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|\\"Hannibal\\" is a great movie, its not an action packed movie but that doesnt make the thrill of its plot be any less dramatic. Dr. Lecter is a mastermind at everything he does but \\"Clarise\\" or special agent Starling does everything to stay on his toes.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wasent expecting to like this movie but it was fun to watch.A nice collaberation of drama and action. Very much recommend
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book. Can't wait for the next one!! I have seen the movie too . They r both awesome.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|A good story, fine animation, engaging characters, and just slightly goofy. I thought the concept of characters moving between video games in an arcade was a refreshing take on 'Tron', plus it avoids the heavy-handed morality play some of Pixar's movies are loaded down with. Works both on an adult and a kid level, so the whole family can enjoy it. And, given the content and story lines of most of today's films, that is a major plus. Set back, suspend your disbelief and enjoy.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|So far, Restaurant Story has been very rewarding. I like how you can cook different foods like Omelettes , Clam Chowder, and Stew. However, I hate how the food rots quickly and how much it costs for decor. $500 dollars per floor square! These are the only bad sides. Oh, and don't mind someone who says you have to pay for everything. You can chose to buy gems if you wish (with real money). So what are you waiting for? Get cookin'!
B00881PTRC|5.0|The game has a lot of categories of words to choose from and the animation is so funny! I highly recommend this game!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I had this on my phone at first and loved it so I had to download it on my kindle fire. Educational and fun.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book has captivated me since the beginning!  Very good book and the details of the book is what makes it so valuable to me.  Can't wait to read the entire book set!
0307744434|2.0|My book group chose this book, and I didn't want to give up on it.  But I just couldn't take it any more.  She over and over again *tells* us how magical, how perfect, how delightful everything is - but it fell flat and didn't convince me.  Maybe if she'd had wonderful illustrations it would've made a difference, because she obviously had a vision that she tried - and in my opinion failed - to bring to life.
B001BZRUR4|3.0|Our book club read this and we were all disappointed. We expected better from this writer. A good idea but didn't pull it off.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As I read Lean In, I was intrigued at being able to get inside the head of a dynamic, smart woman who is one generation younger than me, and see the corporate world through her eyes. One of the cultural questions she answered for me was this: why are younger women so averse to the terms \\"feminist\\" and \\"feminism\\"? Apparently, Sheryl Sandberg and her contemporaries believe(d) the following:<br /><br />1. Equality having arrived, there's no need for feminism anymore<br />2. Feminists are man-haters who resist makeup and the shaving of one's legs<br /><br />Okay, #2 was a bit tongue-in-cheek. However, having observed conditions in the real world for a few years now, Sandberg has come to see that the playing field is not and will not be level until more women occupy positions of power in the corporate hierarchy. She doesn't suggest that this is due to any malicious intent on the part of men, but rather it's simply a matter of ignorance.<br /><br />To illustrate, she describes having to park far away from her office door when hugely and uncomfortably pregnant. When she designated preferred parking spots to accommodate pregnant workers, no one complained. It was seen as logical. But prior to her taking her place in the C-suite, the issue hadn't been raised.<br /><br />Sandberg talks about not slowing down out of consideration for what might happen in the nebulous future. The example she gives, now famous, is of a young woman confiding her fears of not wanting to accept a job with a lot of responsibility due to the impact it might have on her family. The woman was planning ahead - she didn't even have a boyfriend yet.<br /><br />With this example, Sandberg makes the point that women, having been highly trained and educated, are waving off promotional opportunities. The jury is still out as to why, but she suggests, and I agree, that part of the reason is this: in corporate America, a woman's decision to go through pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, and child-rearing is viewed as a private matter that should not impact her ability to work long hours and irregular schedules, including lengthy and frequent travel as needed. Rightly fearing this may drive her insane, a woman who wants a family may leap off the corporate ladder at a very early stage.<br /><br />Sandberg argues that if a young woman stayed on it long enough to secure a more powerful position, she would be able to exert more control over her work life (a perspective the young woman must trust will happen, since at her current low place on the corporate ladder she can only see her lack of power and control.) After a few promotions, she will be able to delegate some of her work to subordinates, afford more help at home, and influence workplace policies that unfairly impact women and families. Who can find fault with this argument?<br /><br />Sandberg is honest about her own mistakes, and I found that charming. For example, I was amazed that, for all her intelligence and education, she didn't originally intend to negotiate her starting salary with Facebook. Luckily a nice man (her husband) set her straight, and she made a counter offer to Zuckerberg. Reams of guidance have been written about how this error could have impeded her in later years, both at Facebook and with future employers, yet she didn't know. For other women who have not yet made this horrifying discovery, please read [[ASIN:0553384554 Ask For It: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want]] by Babcock and Laschever which in addition to being enlightening and entertaining, offers tons of strategies for preparing yourself to negotiate. And not just for salaries. After reading that book I saved $150 on furniture I was going to buy anyway, by asking one question.<br /><br />But back to Lean In.<br /><br />I was also surprised that she wasn't well informed about how women can sabotage other women in the workplace, particularly women in power. This is an unfortunate truth with roots in biology, and is brilliantly explained in the amazing book, [[ASIN:1585422231 In the Company of Women: Indirect Aggression Among Women:  Why We Hurt Each Other and How to Stop]] by Heim and Murphy. This also suggests the reasons Sandberg was hit with such a backlash for the well-intentioned Lean In.<br /><br />There is so much more to say about Lean In, but let me close with this: I enjoyed learning how this stellar corporate executive struggled, made mistakes, and ultimately learned some strategies that will enable her, her family, and the women (and men) in her corporation to thrive. It's not perfect, and sometimes it's not even pretty, but part of the lesson is to let go of the need for perfection.<br /><br />The other message, younger women, is to get as far and as fast as you can before starting your families. Don't opt out just because it looks too hard from where you're sitting now. The view improves with each rung on the ladder.logy, and is brilliantly explained in the amazing book, [[ASIN:1585422231 In the Company of Women: Indirect Aggression Among Women:  Why We Hurt Each Other and How to Stop]] by Heim and Murphy.

B007VYAJAE|5.0|Loved it best documentary I have seen on Bob Marley. I would recommend for everyone to see this movie if they want the real truth!
B004S699LI|1.0|First off, let's look at the technical aspects.<br /><br />The sound:<br /><br />The main sound and ONLY option is a 5.1 DTS HD MA track. Not too shabby, but could have been better.<br /><br />The video:<br /><br />This is where Echo Bridge just absolutely butchers this film. In some parts, the video is rendered very well, but for the most part, it's awful. Skin tones are \\"orangey\\" in color and the blacks are rather dark blobs. Now, before anyone comments on my TV, it's a 50 inch Sharp Aquos LED with a Sony BDPS360 Blu-ray Player.<br /><br />The extras:<br /><br />NONE! Not even subtitles.<br /><br />This is just like most if not all of Echo Bridge's releases. They buy a certain title, butcher it and then release it without any upgrade in video quality, sound quality or extras. They've done that for years and until we as Blu-ray owners demand better, we will never get better. This is and will be my last Echo Bridge purchase. I got burned before on some Halloween movies and figured it was a fluke. Well, this is evidence.
B007RQ6WCA|3.0|This product was very easy to use on Windows, but on my Kindle, I had to do some searching to locate the file folder, and I had to discover by reading other reviews that your Dropbox MUST be in your Favorites on Kindle in order to get automatic updates.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I can recommend this book, but start from no.1 as the books needs to be read in sequence. It is Jeffery Archer at his best but the warning is that these books are page turners and difficult to stop reading. There are many persons to relate to, but after some pages it becomes easy.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie with a solid story and intense scenes, all typical for Tarantino. Movie has some sad truths but a killer ending... No pun intended...
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This season definitely was very interesting and has a lot of memorable episodes. Really enjoyed the start with search for mysterious Xindi, zombie vulcans, sloth at work, north star living like westerns and then collaboration with Degra. This season kept it interesting again.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game,  I'm hooked......wish it didn't freeze up so much. I play on my phone computer and my kindle.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|I think this movie did a good job of portraying how a person can become addicted and the realities of addiction.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I will only purchase an item that I have already seen.  This way I know what I am getting and will not have wasted my money.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app a lot.  I just don't like playing this version of solitare as much as I do others.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|It kept me turning the pages but some loose ends were left hanging.  I enjoyed the development of the main characters
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider and this version is very easy to use.  My old eyes don't like seeing the smaller version than on my computer, but on the go it is great.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|4th time watching this since it first came out and I still enjoy the acting. Shows why Ed Norton is such a great actor
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved it, off to read more about tesla now. I had no idea all the contributions telsa gave us, I must learn more about this man and about this author as well.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Nice to go back and watch a show that I missed parts of. Nice to pick up on things you missed the first time around.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Firefly and Trek have a great addition to the tribe. Blows past every limit, but keeps all the issues of progress front &amp; center. A little too much histrionics though.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a fun hack n slash game. You just run through dungeons and kill everything! Just download this game
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great stories and plot twists. It's X-Files meets Bones meets CSI. My husband loves it too so it's a show we can watch together.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am rating this book several different ways.  First, I am glad I didn't pay money for it.  I waited about 3 months to download it free from my local library.  I would give this book a 1 star rating for boredom.  I am giving it 3 stars only because it had me hooked trying to figure out the why and to reach the end.  I do agree with the other reviewers that the ending was a big let down!  I don't think I will be reading any more books by this author.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Loveable characters Olivia, Astrid and specially Walter who made me laugh with his social awkwardness. Solid acting and storyline too bad the show is over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always enjoy a good game of solitaire.  familiar and enjoyable. large enough to see and complete in one sitting.<br /><br />thanks
B001IF277K|5.0|Ordered one of these to replace the aging battery in my girlfriend's phone and restored her phone's charge time to a reasonable length. I'm very happy with a working, OEM battery for 1/3 the price you'd pay at the ATT store.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fun science fiction show with good characters that ended way too soon. The follow up movie gave good closure to the show.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Very enjoyable movie.  Probably I cannot add too much to what others have said. I do feel that Daniel Day-Lewis deserved every accolade he received. I really felt like he brought us closer to the historical Lincoln. And Spielberg is undoubtedly a master craftsman. But sometimes it seems a little too contrived and manipulative. I've been here before maybe in Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have had no problems with this app.  Works very well on my Kindle.  I had tried a couple of other youtube apps that did not work at all.
B008133MDK|5.0|Could not wait to watch this season and can't believe it took me so long to watch season one now I am eagerly awaiting season three. As a fan of the works of Arthur Conan Doyle I was not dissapointed in the least
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Cmon Amazon, how do you write a review for a calculator?  It works and doesn't appear to make mistakes and its easy to used.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Everything you expect from a Sherlock Holmes interpretation. Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing.<br />its thrilling and exciting and hard to walk away from
B001XUT6AG|5.0|It is true that the best Star Trek movies from the original cast are the even numbered ones. 2, 4, and 6 were all great movies.  This was the &#34;goodbye&#34; movie for the original cast and its a great story.  It is a thinly veiled comparison to the end of the cold war that happened when Regan was President.  Really good story and the acting is what you would expect from the Star Trek cast.  Some pretty funny parts also that kinda poke fun at William Shatner.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This movie was in my late father's collection, in video.  I thought it was a great movie, so replaced it with the DVD version.  I enjoy the actors.  Great spy movie.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Originally reluctant to watch yet another &#34;cop show,&#34; my eventual curiosity took over -- and was paid back by arguably the best cop show to ever air on TV. Strong in every phase, outstanding in most, I was hooked by the end of the pilot.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This series follows the Borgia's history pretty well.  They sure were evil people.  Good series, have season 3 already pro-ordered.  As always Amazon has the best prices and deliveries are always on time.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I am a and have always been a huge fan of Rollins' work and this easily lived up to expectations with just the right amount of intrigue, history, drama and pace. A great read and as always a lesson in history.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater and had to add it to our collection.  Great addition to the Lord of the Rings series. And you can't beat Amazon's pricing and deilvery,
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I love this blu ray disc. The concert was full of energy and fun. The Video was good and Dts hd was outstanding. Highly recommended.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is addictive; love how they build on previous shows & refer to situations that have happened episodes - hope the show goes on forever
034580404X|5.0|I first read these books because of the hype surrounding them I soon fell in love with Grey and Ana. A classic story of a girl trying to fix a tortured soul with a contemporary and erotic twist.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I stumbled on this show and have been hooked ever since.  The actors, the story.  It's been fun to watch.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I saw the movie and was very moved by it so had to get the book and of course the book is even better than the movie.  I recommend it to anyone who has an interest WWII.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Absolutely, positively one of the best shows in the history of television. I am glad that I waited until the end of the fifth season to start watching. It would have been extremely frustrating to wait a week between episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game really worth $7.00!! Great job Mojang!! Great job. Also, this game is is the CLOSEST game you'll ever get to the actual Minecraft. (Once again,great job Mojang,you deserve it)  :)
B009EHDU7U|3.0|Clever little story with its own built in charm, but...a little too long in finishing up the story. Probably would make a very amusing film. Nice concept.
B004GYY714|5.0|What I love is the variety of stations within each category.  I can even listen to stations from the UK.<br /><br />The calm radio station has the sleep timer and alarm function. This will even pay thru the USB hookup in my car.  Love that!
B0089LOG02|3.0|Wow, what a story!  It did happen.......hard to imagine that people actually thought of this, but then we lived through the Hitler time
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best way to take a Bible (with SO many translations) and Kindle Fire HD at the same time.  Wish I could get the NLT offline as well which was offered awhile ago.  Still love that I can download particular translations as well.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is so smart. The characters so carefully drawn. The plotting so cohesive. The acting so outstanding. Beyond doubt, for me, the most satisfying drama on television.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've never been a StephenKing fan so I just about had to betalked into reading this book. I am so glad I read iit. The concept of time travel isn't new but King uses it well. I felt like I was almost there, saddle shoes and all. Well done.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|An important story in light of current events, I found the story quite compelling.  Syriana gives you insight into the complex issues of our involvement in a foreign country, the view &#34;on the ground&#34; of people on the other side, what we consider in &#34;our own interest,&#34; how corporations wield power, and individual people trying to do things for the right reasons.  Ultimately this is a rather dark tale, but I really appreciated the insights into our involvement in foreign countries, especially ones we do not understand culturally or religiously.  I would recommend looking up the story on Wikipedia;  it helps you understand the people and plot.  I was glad to view this movie online where I could stop and rewind.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|super fun and educational learn a lot and enjoyed playing it a lot very good game you sjlhould play this game.
1477467041|2.0|It is one of the tragedies of our time that good ideas, even excellent ideas or insights are presented in the sloppiest possible manner. Thus with this little book. Rife with spelling errors, terrible formatting and myriad other oversights, it is difficult to concentrate on the substance of the book. One spends more time fascinated by the mass of errors. Instead of pondering the truth of the 'technique', one spends far too much (wasted) time astonished that this mass of mess reached publication.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Does exactly what it was supposed to do.  Recommend it to anyone looking for a better charging option for their nexus 10.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I like Michael Connelly, he is usually a fast and enjoyable read.  I also enjoy the Harry Bosch charactor.  I wasn't dissappointed.
B005PK57IK|5.0|WONDERFUL SHOW!! CHARACTERS WERE ALL WELL DEFINED!! THE PLOTS WERE CRISP AND BELIEVABLE!! GOOD SUSPENSE AS WELL!! LOVE IT!! WHEN WILL THE FOURTH SEASON BE AVAILABLE ON PRIME???
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Refreshing. Amusing. Gentle and beyond the mishaps, a statement about pigeonholing people because of their age or size or gender etc. I expect the film will appear sometime soon?
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was historic, sad, happy, and written very well. I didn't like the 2nd (in the series)&#34;Tommo & Hawk&#34; nearly as much.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|enjoyed the first person narrative. story had a great twist that i didn't see coming. the one negative was that it had more sexual refernces than i care for.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This show hits all themes of our modern world but with better dialogue than any others.  Great settings and costumes.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a fun app.  You will love it out of your mind.  That is all I ever have to say cause it is true one hundred percent.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Kindle Android does not automatically go back to the last page you were reading. I find it difficult to pull up books from the cloud and be able to see everything I have available to me.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The story, particularly because it is based on a true story, is deeply touching and uplifting. But for me what made the movie so absorbing was the interesting dialogue, the wonderful facial expressions of all of the characters throughout the movie, and the charming, intelligent humor. Its nice to be in the audience of a movie where you feel you are being treated as a mature and intelligent adult.  If you loved this movie and haven't yet seen The Intouchables, see that one too.
0374531269|3.0|A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah is a heartbreaking account of Beah's time as a boy soldier. I did not particularly enjoy this memoir; however, Beah does a great job describing hardship that occurred during Sierra Leone's Civil War. I believe this book is an eye-opener regarding child soldiers. Living in America, it is sometimes hard to believe that there is even such a thing as a child solider. This book shows a culture that I was not previously very familiar with. Something that could not escape my mind while reading this book, is that one of the reasons that Beah had to experience a lot of what he went through is because of the globalization of diamonds. Even though diamonds are not the only cause, it is a huge factor that plays part. Once diamonds were found in Sierra Leone they became a huge factor leading up to the war. Harvesting and selling diamonds lead to the money that helped purchase the weapons and ammo that was used at this time. It is really sad and unfortunate to think that globalization could have such a huge impact on so many lives, especially so many children similar to Ishmael Beah.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a very entertaining and charming movie, with good dialogue and interesting absorbing quirkiness. Its uplifting and an thoroughly enjoyable evening,....a sweet and in-depth look at the elder years.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|One of Terentinos best works. Very good movie, with great actors and a good story line.  The whole thing that was said about the movie being a bit too racist how can u talk about the South during the civil war and not talk about racism
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|was not a very good movie it sucked. o would not recomend this movie to anyone it just sucked sucked
0062082353|5.0|Great price and fast shipping. This is a must read book for anyone. If you thank and respect our troops you will enjoy this book.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Love this game but when you choose your character be careful(ogres get awesome cards)I don't write reviews so get it it's free
B004DLPXAO|5.0|easy to install and use.  Works with my library system to check out books.  Really happy with it.  very nice
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good continuity of story. Enjoyed it the culmination of the series and the resolution of the characters. Definitely not your run-of-the mills teen story.
B0000541AM|5.0|Classic movie. I saw this as a teen in theaters, and now my teen nephews love it as well. Thats the mark of a true classic.<br />FYI ... This is the remastered original, not the foolish cartoon laden remake.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I always like Star TreK Movies, I like Science Fiction Movies.  I would recomment to anyone who likes Science Fiction
B008602KQI|1.0|I would not recommend this book especially to young adult readers. Hunger is a world crisis and it is not topic that should be not viewed as a form of entertainment. The world is so desensitized fiction is no longer fiction the lines are muted and blared So in parts of our world community Hunger is a constant daily struggle even in our own USA i am not talking about some impoverished country in a foreign place your neighbor may be Hungry and you don't know and if you did would you care? Or think its just a game they are playing
1439153663|5.0|I enjoyed the story line and all of the details that helped to make the story believable.  Yes, I would recommend this book to my friends.  I have done so already.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I am pretty sure this is a burned cd, the packaging was different than my friend's who bought hers at the store, but the video works fine in my DVD player, like the work out, short bursts so by the time your ready to give up, it's over
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I kept passing this movie up because I can't stand the cover and as well all know first impressions are what draw you in. Well, I finally gave in and watched this one and it was definitely a keeper, I even ended up buying it after I rented it!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie was very good, every once in a while a little bit of a tear jerker, but for the most part very inspirational.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I know some of the reviews have said the singing is not up to par and I would agree that it is not the best, but it still was a great movie. Down fall was that it was really long and ever time I thought it was going to end there was another twist.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a good read. It puddered out a bit at the end which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
B002HC67U6|5.0|This movie will make you laugh, make you cry and make you fall in love with the characters!  Wonderful movie!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What an amazing story. It took a little while to get into it but once you do you cannot put it down!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app. It's so much fun to have a virtual horse.  The only thing about it that I don't like is that it's hard to get gems. But other than that it's great. :) :) :)
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|it was a awesome book even I love it and I'm 24 keep Writhing these books please love Hannah love it
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the rope and cut the rope experiments were awesome,but make way for time travel!!!with new features like movable obstacles,time freeze and more!if I only had one dollar to spend,I would buy this!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Showed social conditions within a good love story without getting preachy or soapy. Also ended on a positive note, showing how we can all compromise in order to make a better world for everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is so easy to use come in handyn very often. i really like that it is so large. would get again
0812993357|4.0|Grace Coddington is the Creative Director of American Vogue magazine. She is the right hand confidant and partner of Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue, the most important person in the editorial fashion business in the world. Grace has her finger on the pulse of fashion and commerce. She is super passionate and dedicated to her work and her creativity. When she nods in the direction of a selected photographer, model or designer it's like fairy dust from the good witch. She is famous for designing photographs that make people swoon and dream. She explains in interesting detail every aspect of the production of a photo shoot from the beginning inspiration, choice of designers, props, models, photographer, and locations to the final page layout as it appears in the magazine. This is a lazy hazy first person past tense memoir. A matter of fact linear story that hops around. Starting with her childhood on an island off the coast of Wales. The daughter of the manager of a 32-room summer.<br />She grew up dreaming of being in the fashion world she read about in the magazines and saw in the movies. She says she doesn't read books only tabloids that keep her abreast of who's who in the world, explaining how celebrity has become the new best selling cover girl. There is a lot of travel dialogue describing her vagabond location trips.<br />She touches on her early days in mod London when music, Vidal Sassoon and miniskirts were shocking. She went off to London for a two-week course in fashion modeling and bingo; she was a paid model. Her trials and tribulations and her enormous successes are described without any excitement.I wanted more she is brilliant.<br />She has peppered the pages with great photographs and her very whimsical and charming drawings of her cats and models on the runway. She made friends with many of the famous models, actors, photographers and musicians of her time. She had affairs and married more than a few of them. She name drops without telling us why the people are important. It's a no back stabbing expose. That seems very appropriate for the English sensibility of only appearing in print at birth, marriage and death.<br />Grace does points out that she is a very private person. She and her husband Didier a French hairdresser, and her cat family, \\"hardly ever socialize.\\" I think that and her fear of public speaking are maybe what make some of the stories so unexciting.<br />She has lived her life below the radar until the recent release of the terrific documentary \\"The September Issue.\\" Where we fell in love with her. She describes how she was talked, and pressured, into contributing to that project by allowing herself to be filmed at work; she suddenly became a celebrity that is now recognized on the street. She is a smart business woman; I think she wrote the book to financially capitalize on her recent celebrity, not to share her extraordinary insights into a world she has helped shape.I am still a fan of hers.<br />Half way through the book I felt like I was in a pretty bed of pastel colored flowers sipping high tea with Alice.
B00C5ZS5SC|4.0|I love this album. It was recommended to me and on sale, so I decided to try it after listening to the samples. What a great surprise. This is an excellent beginning for Jessie Ware.
B005R32L66|1.0|I have no choice but to rate this product low. It does not meet my needs and is very frustrating
141659521X|5.0|This book was bought for me, by my husband!  So this review is being written by Jane Thatcher.  I love Vince Flynn!  He's my favorite author, so every I wait anxiously for his next book to be released.  Every book is an absolute &#34;page-turner&#34; that I can barely put down.  LOVE his main character, Mitch Rapp!!!  I highly recommend his entire body of work!  He's the best political thriller/counter intelligence author around!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Loved the Book Thief. Loved this book. Mr. Zusak has such a great way of story telling that is unique but still engaging. Really enjoyable.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|This is the expanded verision of the original move of the history changing event. More to see of the event that molded the culture of this country today.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have trouble enjoying books where I do not find any of the characters likeable and this fell into that category so for the first 40% of the book I was frustrated, but then the story takes off and the last half is unputtdownable.
B00009P1O0|4.0|This is a look at Neil Young in his classicl time of launching out on his own. Druged heavy blues Hippie rock of the early 70's tainted by the epic of the latter 60's
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Because of her varied background, all the Temperance Brennan novels and TV show Bones,bring so much reality to each.  I truly enjoy both to be as real as it can be.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Much lighter in tone than the preceding Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is more in line with a jaunty fairy tale than a fantasy epic. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing - that's how the source material reads and there's plenty of room in the genre - but it seems to be internally conflicted about that. It's constantly stretching and reaching for more serious, grandiose moments which seem out of place and extraneous. For the most part, though, it strikes the right chords and delivers a jolly, magical adventure that's plenty of fun to tag along with... even if it does grow long-winded in spots. As an audio-visual showcase, though, it never stumbles. From sweeping landscape to stunning vista, breathtaking architectural relics to disgusting subterranean creatures, it runs a vast gamut and never ceases to amaze. For that reason alone, it's worth a long glimpse. The plot does seem overstuffed and more than a little long, but it still feels like there was enough material here to justify three films, which was a concern going in. Adds nice depth to the original three films, although it wisely doesn't try to compete with them.
1451695195|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I was a patient of his father many years ago and I know how proud he would be to read the testimony of Eben.  A peak of heaven for all to see through this writing.  Great rejoicing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game shocked me, apart from big fish games I have not enjoyed any other hidden object/ puzzle games. The graphics were excellent and the game user friendly.
0385349831|2.0|This book attempts to impart generic spiritual guidance to its readers. However, I do not feel that I received any enlightenment whatsoever. The advice is extremely vague, broad, and repetitive. The advice usually something along the lines of \\"spread love\\" and \\"you must accept change in order to flourish\\" (though couched in sometimes flowery language.) Stuff that we have all heard before. While these sentiments are generally correct(in my opinion), I'm looking for a unique or thought-provoking treatment of this subject matter. This book did not provide that. There wasn't even a somewhat interesting story within which the advice was nestled (as was the case in \\"The Alchemist\\").<br /><br />In addition, the book presents a male-centered, monotheistic worldview as correct. For instance, the book confusingly refers to a higher power interchangebly as \\"God\\" and \\"the Divine Energy.\\" It's as if the author is saying that these two phrases mean the same thing, when they most certainly do not. Coelho should have just picked one term and stuck with it. Also, \\"sons\\" and the pronouns \\"his\\" and \\"him\\" are usually used, which is exclusive of 51% of humanity.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|Technically well crafted film, however what starts as a pretty original gore-free ghost story with guaranteed chills turns into a sentimental cheese fest an hour into it. Along with teary eyed little children, overly dramatic angel choir music and a ghost who is not the slightest bit scary anymore as nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. Del Toro should be more careful about what production he stamps his name on.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is a very helpful book and I am so glad that I bought it, it is changing how I live my life.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this. Very few people get a second shot at things and watching this made me happy for him!
B002M5E2DW|3.0|If you've seen the video you do not need to get this book, it has nothing in it that is not in the video and neither of them tell you how to achieve what they are talking about.  Very disappointed in this book.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|very different style of writing.not many nice people as characters but that is one of the reasons it makes it all the more intrigueing.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The movie was partially based on the book, &#34;Team of Rivals&#34;. I was happy to see, many of the themes of the historial book made it into the movie. But it only hints at just how rich and more complex this man's life and struggles with the Civil War played out.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is phenominal, playing Lincoln as described by Doris Kearns (author of the book), perfectly. Alway measured, awkward in the halls of power, but clearly a master politican carrying both public and private weights on his shoulders.<br /><br />The supporting cast also were in excellent form, David Strathairn, James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />Sally Fields also played the real Mary Todd-Lincoln and not the caricature many have come to know, a woman with more depth then popular knowledge remembers her as having.<br /><br />A great movie.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is very addictive, just sucks you have to be online to play. Wish it had a way to play offline :)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I choose to give it five stars because it is a great story.  I am a history teacher and this appears to be quite accurate as far as the things we do know about the Vikings. The acting is good also.  Have always liked Gabriel Byrne and the person who plays Rathgar<br />is good.  I think we will be seeing more of him on screen.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been having a lot of trouble with the app &#34;not responding&#34; Even with a brand new kindle that hadnt been used but for maybe 10 minutes or however long it took just to download this app. I have had trouble with pictures loading also. BUT overall I fully enjoy this app. I would much rather use the app then have to use the web version.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|I began my medical practice 34 years ago. Over the years, I have seen many highly promoted drugs go off the market. In fact, during the past five years, drugs like Avandia and Darvocet that were used by millions of patients, have been removed from pharmacies. Drug representatives often encourage physicians to replace Common and inexpensive products with the newest, most costly and less established medicines. Dr. Goldacre has opened my eyes to multitudes of pharmaceutical endeavors that every doctor and patient will find disturbing. This book is timely, relevant and easy to understand. The author is also charming and, at times, funny. Bad Pharma should be read by all medical students and practitioners.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My Kids LOVE this app. They are always asking to play. Its easy to use and very helpful in keeping the kiddos busy while out and about
B00631VJIC|5.0|Great music! My only complaint is: not ALL the songs from every episode. Great riding music, and certainly worth buying a copy.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|amazing. graphics are great and sound effects are very realistic. campaign is fun, multiplayer even better. (hint) - if you play multiplayer buy the compakt665. most expensive,  but best gun. or OPS65 which is a good but cheap smg.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A cross between &#34; We need to talk about Kevin&#34; and &#34;Presumed Innocent &#34;, this story is very parent's worst nightmare- both the victim's and accused.  The main character struck me as unrealistic, he is a man who can define his wife's clothing style but can't define his child's behavior.  The theory of a murder gene is accepted without much argument, and a psychologist practically accuses a mother of causing a physoloical problem by having had placed a child in daycare. Not your typical suburban family
0525952926|5.0|Follett is an excellent author with fully developed characters and historically intriguing plot.  It is worth the time it takes to read this very long book.
0312330855|3.0|I usually don't write reviews positive or negative. I'm making an exception here because I don't know the condition of the book because it was a gift. Scheduled for delivery on Tuesday 23rd but didn't arrive until the 25th. It was a gift for Administrative Assistants Day and the person left for vacation at noon on Thursday it arrived, according to tracking, at 12:40 PM.<br /><br />My major complaint is that this always happens when Amazon ships a small via. FedX. This is  because they turn it over to USPS for final delivery which always delays the item at least one day. I didn't think it would happen to a book in a major city otherwise I would have ordered it earlier. I have always considered UPS & FedX about equal but if I could choose a shipper I would choose UPS then either the US Post Office or DHL over FedX. If nothing else the former three have the decency to ring the door bell when they leave a package - rain or shine. I thought it was a local issue but since the book was delivered 400 miles from me it must be business as usual for Fed Express.
1401938906|4.0|Being a big fan of quantum physics and the law of attraction, I looked forward to reading this book.I managed to manifest this book easily and free through Hay House. I could not do three of the none experiments, I succeeded in four out of the six I tried. I know that likely the other two would have worked if I had been more focused. I have done similar experiments before at times and they worked.They worked when I put more focus and visualization into them.<br /><br />  I tried experiment #1(The Dude Abides Principle) and it worked within two hours.<br /><br />  I tried #4(The Abracadabra Principle),but didn't get the thing I was trying to  manifest.<br /><br />  For experiment #5(The Dear Abby Principle), I received my answer in the affirmative.<br /><br />  In the #7 experiment(The Jenny Craig Principle), I lost 1lb. I Knew of this  experiment before and I did lose weight then.<br /><br />  For #8(The 101 Dalmatians Principle),I did not receive any response from my target.<br /><br />  Lastly,in experiment #9(The Fish and Loaves Principle), I did notice more good things  in my life.<br /><br />  This book is great. Even though it felt like a bit of as rehash of other books,I did learn new things. I found the author wrote in a down-to-earth way and mixed with humor. The only negative thing I have to say about the book is that it did not explain technique in detail as I would have like it to. Other than that, it is a great book.<br /><br />FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for this review. The opinion in this review is unbiased and reflects my honest judgment of the product.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is one of the few well crafted action movies of late.  Of course, if you cannot stand shoot em up movies, then this is definitely not for you.<br />The tension between Dredd and his trainee, created a sense of realism for me, which is difficult to relay in a Sci-Fi setting.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I am very thankful for this book. Since I have read it, I have recommended to many people to get their 10,000 hours in. It's amazing how hard work and amazing opportunities prove to make people into Outliers...
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The songs are long, but Very soulful, and good.  They are already playing most of the songs on the Radio, and there is a reason for it!  ok so they might be pushing him, but unlike some artist he does have talent!  My fav are'Strawberry Bubblegum, Suit & Tie,  lovin 'Pusher Love Girl'  for some reason i think he was getting high when working on this CD, only because it's mellow, but not too mellow..  Anyway I enjoyed it.. Chris Brown better come out with something BANGin like this
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book was an entertaining read but nothing to write home about.  I was surprised that this book didn't wow me very much because it came highly recommended by many sources including Time Magazine.  The characters were quirky and sarcastic and some interesting points were made about cancer patients, but I had a hard time emotionally connecting to the book. It is an easy read though.
0307593525|5.0|Watched Julia Julia and bought this on a whim...I have yet to make one recipe out of it but it is on my to do list lol
B003204MQS|4.0|I've seen a few scary movies, and this is the only one that actually scared me. Maybe I found this movie to be scary because I fear the unknown. I think this film captures that pretty well.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Didn't watch when it was out in the 90's - but having a greattime watching now! It is my bedtime show.<br /><br />Love the Hawaii landscape, looking for familiar Oahu locales and wondering just where it will all go/end.
B009AMANH4|5.0|REALLY enjoyed this &#34;blu-ray combo&#34; of Lincoln ~ I really felt like I was THERE during that pivotal time in history ~ well done!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I have read many of Lee Child books about Reacher, and saw the movie, I always enjoy the read and the movie was much<br />more then I had anticipated. Did not think Tom C. would be able to carry the character, HE DID
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Great fun. Young read full of imagination and spirit. Enjoyed. Quick read with good descriptions and fast moving plot and few wild turns.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A good writer can tell a convincing story.  A great writer can create a convincing world within which his story exists.  A masterful writer immerses you deep in that world, disorienting you when you return from it.<br /><br />The world of Wool is immersive right from the beginning; Howey's prose evokes the imagination with sights, sounds, smells, even the feeling of surfaces and objects.  I could see the silo, the rooms, the staircase, and the characters in my mind as I read, and I felt their feelings of duty, doubt, betrayal, and hopelessness.<br /><br />The dystopian &#34;humanity survives underground&#34; concept is hardly new, but Wool partially subverts it by putting the focus on the characters and their thoroughly fleshed-out lives, rather than the world they live in.  We get glimpses of the reality that brought them there, but there are no broad, preachy, high concepts.  Unlike most dystopian fiction this is not a cautionary tale.  Instead, it is a celebration of the strength of humanity, and an exploration of the barriers and obstacles we build for ourselves, both literal and figurative.
B00AOMR2S2|3.0|I wish it would have more of the mixes from the main character. Other than that it's OK even though it's not normally what I listen to.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This pocket edition is pathetic the world is tiny and in survival there is no hunger it makes it really boring i need to stop bitching
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have already read the entire series to date, and finally found and read the story that started Reacher's travels.  This book is outstanding.  The reader gets to know the characters and how Reacher thinks.  I was hooked from page 1 and hated to put the book down for sleep.  It's a really good book and I recommend you stick with Lee Child until you read everything he has written.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|The first season started out with Frank Darabont very much in control of the screen character development, great season 1. Season two still, having most of the episodes surrounded with Darabont's signature, a very good season 2(should have been the last). By the time season two had ended it was obvious (at least to me) that Mr. Darabont had no intention of chaining himself to a television series. AMC realizing they had a core audience hungry for more ($$$) quickly moved to make 'TWD'an integral part of their fall/winter schedule. Without Frank Darabont, I'm afraid this show is as doomed as those that have crossed over, known forever more as 'walkers. Evident by (S3) the complete reconstitution of a very good mini-series that should have ended were intended, at the end of season two.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This is written as a book being written by a young man -- but you never get the sense that the third-person author is in charge. The character seems free to not follow any pre-arranged outline. Again, as with Spot of Bother, you never lose sight of the plot even though it is written as the internal dialogue of the character.
B005LAII1C|5.0|this movie is very funny, got it at a great price and seth macfarlane is a comedy god haha ill recommend this to everyone over 18!!
B002JVWQT6|4.0|Running Time: 22 min/episode<br /><br />Perceived Running Time: 19 min/episode<br /><br />Replay-ability: fair<br /><br />Estimated Durability: three generations<br /><br />Audience: hip families<br /><br />Why: This is some pretty smart, funny material. It pokes fun at some of the various family types, traditional and non-traditional, of modern America while celebrating them. Deals with sensitive issues with some finesse. Extremely good-spirited with believable characters that develop and grow. Very talented acting, especially the kids. Never cynical or workmanlike. It's clear everyone involved is really \\"into\\" this project, and the passion shows. It certainly deserves all the acclaim it's received.<br /><br />Why not: It can be predictable at times, and skews pretty heavily wealthy and WASPy.<br /><br />Kudos: No laff track. Thanks for bringing back Al from Married with Children.<br /><br />Demerits: It's kinda weird that the gay guys NEVER kiss.<br /><br />Verdict: A worthy edition to any library of modern TV comedy. Good, family-time viewing that my fifth-grader enjoyed watching infinitely.
B004RL9T50|5.0|The movie had witty lines and was fun to watch.  It taught a good lesson about not letting destiny control you, but use your God given gifts to do what you can.
0307352153|2.0|This book gave a lot of examples of introverts and what they did to deal with their temperament in many situations but the books struck me as more of a series of short stories than a self-help book.  Try &#34;The Introvert Advantage&#34; instead.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Already one of my favorite Star Trek series, season 3 reaches &#34;new heights&#34;.  Every episode has depth, intensity and even a bit of humor.  The season culminates with an unforgettable encounter with the Borg--a must see!
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|Believeable and rivetting, I loved this book. The relationship between Leo and Raisa is very well-drawn; their emergence from the paranoid world of Stalin's Soviet Union where suspicion even between husband and wife is 'normal', to love of one another. The pursuit of the serial child killer through a snowy world is gripping.<br /><br />Two quibbles; one is that the old Freudian idea that aberrations of this kind are caused by some childhood trauma. I think we know now there is simply evil in the world. Causeless and ceaseless, child killers can't be analyzed, only executed.<br /><br />quibble 2 is in regards to the sudden conversion of frightened peasants on a kolkhoz to aid Leo and Raisa, a resistance to the Soviet power. Not possible. the Russian peasants had been beaten, cowed and their sustaining culture destoyed for centuries. A dependent people is an infantilized population. They are taught to get their needs from Authority, and Authority must be begged and manipulated, occasionaly subjectesd to tantrums, but never really resisted.<br /><br />But there is a kindheartedness to this book and this writer that is very moving. He --- and I and many others --- truly want to believe in a strong and honest rural folk who will do the right thing, like the French peasants aiding the resistance, like rural English folk in Dickens. Scott at least resists the fashionable --- and now growing stale -- temptation for a depressing/disastrous ending. There's a kind of belief in the better half of human nature. That's one important factor that makes this a good book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's addictive.  The whole game experience is great. Not sure by I have a minimum of words to explain this though.
B000OVLBGC|3.0|Service great, dvd was new and in great shape. DVD itself was somewhat depressing, but that was not your fault of course.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The story line is weak and unrealistic.  As an example, the main female bites her lip which infuriates the male character.  I would not recommend reading this book.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|sucks, locks up all the time slow to respond. looks hood just doesn't respond the way it should. Two stars Max.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I came across Lana Del Rey by accident, looking for a new sound and came across Video Game on a mix album.  Cool song, so I checked her out.  She is awesome.  Every song is at least good, some songs like Without You and Radio are beautiful yet cool.  This album is playing a lot lately.  I hopes she puts another album out soon.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is awesome! So many characters and its easy to lvl up and make money.Great way to pass time and tons of fun. It's easy to control and fun to play. Definitely a five star from me.
B003B02PFO|4.0|For someone who is immersed in Christmas every year, the story just couldn't be for me - how could anyone skip it?
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I hate how everyone puts what happens in the book as their review. It gives the book away. I loved reading this book. I think it showed that people have relationships no mater how dysfunctional the couple can still make it through. The ups and downs were great! I think that even though Travis was dysfunctional Abby was just as bad! Great story! Awesome ending! I couldn't put it down I literally read this book in two days!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I will enjoy reading this one again.  I've talked to people - strangers - who have read it also and we connect.  I enjoy history and this was so much to absorb that I WILL need to read it again to see what I missed the first time around.  What an author.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) is doing brain research at the Miskatonic Medical School in Massachusetts. Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is back from a stint in Zurich with the infamous Dr. Hans Gruber (Al Berry), stating that there was nothing more he could learn there (Gruber dies, West revives him to eye-exploding effect). West feels Hill has stolen his ideas from Gruber. Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) is a student dating the Dean's daughter, Megan (Barbara Crampton). West answers Cain's ad for a roommate. He keeps to himself behind a closed door, and conducts experiments in the basement. West is researching \\"death,\\" with his glowing green solution. He is quite serious, straight-laced and determined, to the point of psychotic. With his reagent, re-animation is possible. He tries it out on Dan's (mysteriously) deceased cat. The cat freaks. It seems the bigger the animal, the more violent the reaction. You can imagine what it does to humans. The dark humor in Re-Animator is quite delightful. And it's not to the point where it detracts from the horror. This movie is outrageous, completely demented, and gloriously gory! Richard Band deserves a special shout out for his awesome orchestral score! Aww yeah!
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I've been a fan of the musical for over 10 years, seen a Broadway production and a national tour.  Aside from a few less than ideal singing voices, this is a great film adaptation of a great classic musical.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Jamie Foxx was amazing.  Great cast, great acting.  Definitely a Tarantino film, so if you're a fan of his you'll love it.<br /><br />I dock half a star for length, it really needed to be edited like an extra 30-45 min out of it because it is long.<br /><br />Two scenes were very disturbing for me, but other than that it wasn't more \\"gory\\" than other R rated movies out there.  And you've got to remember, this is the stuff that was ACTUALLY happening during this terrible time in our country.<br /><br />We rented the movie, now buying to add to our library.  If you don't want to buy it, at least rent it, it's definitely worth watching!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|A great follow up to season one.  I love the characters and the intrigue, and development over time.  Highly recommended.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My family and I are huge fans of the Batman series. This one certainly does not disappoint! Great quality production.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Lots of fun! My friends and I have so much fun playing this game. I'm working on beating the hi score.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie and the walking eggs were perfect for Easter.  The boys loved the characters in the movie
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Books seem to always be better because of our own imagination seeing things.  But I found the movie to be pretty close to the story written, what, about 70 years ago, and I don't think it could've been done any better...though its kind of disappointing that they made it into kind of like two movies.
B000AAVDGA|1.0|This movie was made to watch only on a British DVD player. Nowhere did it mention it when I purchased it. I am completely unable to watch it now. Not happy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun game and it's easy to get sucked in when you have too much time on your hands.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|THE STORY OF A GOOD YEAR IS TRULY ALL ABOUT SCREEN TIME FOR RUSSELL CROWE.  I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH, HOWEVER, THE STORY IS NOT RELATED AT ALL  TO THE ORIGINAL PLAY.<br /><br /> I PURCHASED A YEAR IN PROVENCE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO STARRING JOHN THAW AND LINDSEY DUNCAN. THE STORY TRULY TOOK YOU THROUGH THE  FOUR SEASONS.  VERY GOOD STORY.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing it<br />I TELL all my friends<br />its challenging to play so it makes it more fun to play
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Loved it brought back lots of memories,worth getting to see how a real musical play is done. The costumes and lighting were fantastic.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I need more than 40 coins to play when I log on. It takes me longer to log on than it does to play the 40 coins.
1878424114|5.0|Love this book! For years it was on my check list of books to read, but I never got around too it. Happy that I did because the book is very inspiring please take the time to read it.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|Great game. Takes a little time  to get going. Graphics are great. It's a cute and enjoyable games. It's definitely worth the time.
0800141806|5.0|This is one of my old vhs movies that I wanted to replace with dvd and I am very pleased with the quality of the picture and sound.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love all these artists and their music, thought price was good. Looking forward to buying the 2nd one real soon.
B00933JF74|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but it is very confusing for someone like me who is not very &#34;gamer experienced&#34;. I can't even figure out how to get out of the tutorial! The details are great. I like building a town with &#34;townies&#34;, but I need a &#34;hints&#34; tab or something like that.<br />I've even watched the &#34;tuts&#34; on utube but it's all for stuff that's farther than I am. But, till I get help or figure it out, it keeps me company (I'm an insomniac) in the middle of the night!
B009VB97EY|1.0|Written to Amazon twice, I have never had to opportunity to see the damn thing! I can watch any cheap .99 movie I want but the one I'm willing to pay to see never gets loaded to my library. Some guy in another country assured me he fixed it and it was there, NOT!!!!
B005721W9O|4.0|This film is quirky, nerd candy and just plain FUN !!!  Each of the characters is entertaining, but Alan Richman really tickles me, as the cranky British Actor, trapped in a role that has become unending torture for him.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|...how this show could be cancelled after only two seasons.  It's well-written, very engaging, and maintains the continuity of the Terminator movies.  The longer Sarah Connor wages her war against the machines, the more she shows her fatigue and despair, while John Connor understands his role but desperately tries to hang onto some semblance of a childhood.  Meanwhile, [FBI] Agent Ellison begins piecing together the Connors' story and gets caught up in the future war in his own way.  Too bad it was under-promoted else it would easily be in its 6th or 7th season by now.  Ah, well, Lena Headey is making good in Game of Thrones.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very, very good.  I liked the prospective from a scientific person and how he was able to speak to his readers about what an awesome experience he had.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|i watched this film to see Gina Carano in an action movie.<br />so i'm not going to complain about weak story development or hard to follow sequences.<br /><br />typical action movie so that warrants 3 stars.<br />add Gina Carano into the mix and it's worth 4 stars.<br /><br />Gina is a beauty, her acting is decent, and her fight scenes are great.<br />only wish the movie was a little better vehicle for Gina and the supporting actors (Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas).<br /><br />if you are a fan of action movies in general, it's worth watching.<br />for Gina Carano fans, it's a must see.<br /><br />if you're more interested in a great movie and have no special affinity for Gina Carano, you might consider looking somewhere else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It the best game ever. But how do you update to 0.7.0<br />I can't believe how fun it is! Wow.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|We've now purchased and viewed all 5 Seasons Back to Back and the whole family is hooked.  Been Watching Season 6 together every Sunday night on AMC.  Only challenge is now having to wait all week to watch another episode.  Over the past few weeks, we got used to being able to watch 3-5 episodes back to back on a Friday or Saturday night. :))
B00003CX9W|4.0|I would recommend this vendor.  I got it in 2 days!<br />I wanted to replace my VHS version of this marvelous musical compilation -- perfect!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Stupid software opened with an advertising popup and then crashed my phone.  I deleted it immediately. It wasn't worth the price and it was free.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|We are enjoying the legal series about a female attorney, her husband and all that is involved with their lives.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My whole family lived watching Downton abbey.  We all looked forward to the next episode.  I would recommend it to all of my friends.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great show - can't wait for season 4! The set allows me access to one of my favorire shows at any time. Well packaged, and had no trouble viewing. Have also loaned out to friends successfully.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Bought this to use to with our Baby Jogger since the BJ doesn't come with a parent console to put my cell phone, drink, keys etc.  It is great.  There is no zipper section to this, but that's ok.  It's made of all fabric, so I was concerned about how it would handle stabilizing a drink, but the elastic is so strong to hold it in place and so far I haven't had a problem.  I actually like this better than the hard plastic parent console I have on my old Graco stroller. Time will tell how well the elastic holds out, but at this price even if it only lasted me a few years I'd purchase another to replace it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second book in George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series continues to develop the story of political intrigue as lords and ladies play at their &#34;game of thrones.&#34; While there are vivid descriptions of battles, it's the politics that will keep you coming back. Martin's unflinching ability to kill off main characters to further the story makes for a narrative that you never know which way it will turn. Furthermore, each chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, which makes the book a real page turner: you always want to &#34;check in&#34; with your favorite characters.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|So annoying to see the books out of order by series. Seem like a simple enough thing to do to just manually organize your own library, why can't they do it already? Really looking forward to seeing that feature sometime in the NEAR future!!
B004XWLN20|5.0|I didn't watch Smallville from the beginning so it's nice to have the collection to watch at my leisure instead of having to DVR episodes.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|This movie is hard to watch but worth watching. It gives a hard look at the lives and consequences of four drug addicts. I recently re watched this film and still feel that the mother's story is the most interesting. The other three characters are young and have the ideals that nothing can hurt them since for awhile it seemed true until the world of drugs hit them hard.  Their story is one you have probably seen before but still worth watching the graphic depiction of the dangers of drugs. The mom's story was one that at the time this movie first came out was not talked about and is just barely  (because if recent celebrity events) getting the attention that prescription drugs are Drug Drugs. Just because a pharmacists hands you the bag and not some dealer in the alley does not make them safer. I would recommend this movie but it is not for the faint of heart due to it's graphic content.
1423136802|5.0|Given as a gift to grandson & he was elated.  Needless to say scored mucho points.  ha ha  He asked for more.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella and this book doesn't disappoint.  Great story and fun reading. Hilarious and fun for anyone who loves chick lit.
1423140591|5.0|Given as gift to grandson.  So glad that he loves to read.  Do not mind buying books for him so that he can explore other worlds without leaving his earth world.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I haven't been as enthralled with a show in quite a long time.  The streaming quality from Prime was great, but the show is great!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Given as gift to friend who really really wanted this album.  She was as happy as Susan winning &#34;American Idol&#34;.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone in the USA.  Steven Spielberg is one of the best.  Daniel Day-Lewis did a superb job.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|A visual and emotional masterpiece that will leave you so curious with the ending you'll watch a 2nd time right away.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|awesome movie
1400049628|5.0|I have not even finished it yet and I love it. Hilarious, creepy, and very well thought out (almost too well thought out...) either way I'd keep it around for entertainment and just in case the Zombie Apocalypse ever actually happens.
0345529057|5.0|I'm really impressed by the appearance of the volumes in this collection. The publishers did a fine job, as far as I'm concerned. Easy to carry places in a book bag.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|NERDS OF THE WORLD UNITE! Finally a comedy show for people who like more than just potty humor or sex jokes.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|First I want to say that I'm not a fan of the violin... it's just not my cup of tea.  However, Lindsey has found a way to make the violin &#34;music to my ears&#34; as she combines it with trance and dub-step to create a unique and amazing blend of music.  If you enjoy DJ/Dance/Trance type music and you want something just a little different, then I would definitely tell you to give her music a try.  She's rather eccentric in her music videos, but the music she produces is just amazing!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Enjoyable to watch love the period movie was set. Love actors who really love the rolls they play. Need more movies of this quality
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and exiting. I love taking care of animals and now I can always.
0062059963|4.0|The Selection was my favorite read of last year.  Yes, it reminded me of The Bachelor and I loved every bit of it.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on The Elite!<br /><br />And while I still flew through The Elite (reading it in less than 24 hours..it's been a while since I did that!), I didn't find it as good as The Selection.  The love triangle between America and Aspen and Maxon got old after a while.  Oh she's so in love with Maxon when she's with him.  Then it's always been Aspen when she's with him.  I get the hard decision, but it was a little too much.  Did that stop me from loving the book and dying to know who she was going to pick?  Nope!  I still tore through the book trying to figure out which boy she would end up with.<br /><br />Although neither boy really did it for me this time.  Some of Maxon's actions made me like him even more, some of his actions made me question his feelings for America.  Oh, it so is like The Bachelor!  And Aspen--still don't really see what America sees in him except that he's always there for her.<br /><br />And oh the drama!  Drama with the girls, drama with the king, drama all around.  Love it!  It's so easy to fall into this series and I so want to know what is going to happen and who America is going to choose!<br /><br />And there's an e-novella called The Prince told from Maxon's point of view coming out on March 5?  Just pre-ordered it!
B004VFOT4I|3.0|The picture quality was not too great on the laptop computer.  Hoping the next rental we be easier to view.
044654759X|5.0|i was so excited to get this book and i read it and it was awsome , i was so excited by the quality of the book and the delivery time was shorter than i thought it would be.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Had Facebook for awhile. Great app for staying in touch with friends & family. Easy download for iphone & kindle fire
0446547654|4.0|i was shocked again by the quality of the book when it arrived, this book was alittle slow to me at parts but i am still reading it and it is starting to get good again and i can't put it down.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|There are passages that reference Yes, Genesis, ELP and King Crimson...The music is at once harsh AND uplifting; this is no ordinary ode to the Progressive Greats...Steve WIlson is not &#34;copying a genre&#34; - he is LIVING IT...I am absolutely enthralled by this music and it not only makes me feel young, because something I held in such high esteem has been brought to life again, it makes me feel re-connected to my youth in truly moving ways. The stories are dark and yet the music moves one to a happier place - witness the title track that takes one through the obsessive thoughts of a reclusive old man, but an old man who realizes the Raven cannot answer his call for it to sing simply because he NEEDS IT TO...Sing to me Raven....I Miss Her (Progressive Music) SO MUCH!!! A very dark moment in the video is followed by the release of the once trapped Raven and a powerful and moving crescendo performed in the most epic fashion by a craftsman who enjoys writing songs that touch the soul and move its listeners both with dischord and harmony...Thank you Steve Wilson for &#34;SINGING&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a good calculator for all kinds of uses, i haven't used it a whole lot but it is good to have
B008LSVLVA|5.0|If you are a fan of Steve Wilson's work with Porcupine Tree and other projects like Blackfield, you will enjoy this live session! As a fan of the Progressive genre, I feel Steve is in rare form these days; his performances are powerful and creative and a must see for those who thought the best era of Pop and Rock music was the late 70s, when concept albums and orchestral epics were more commonplace. Anything but mainstream, Steve can truly touch the soul of a music lover who is into extreme dynamics: quiet, moving pieces (or &#34;bits&#34; as the English would say) juxtaposed against brutal gut wrenching chords. I think a song like &#34;Index&#34; conjours up visions of Peter Gabriel at his height and even at a relatively brief 7 minutes, still recreates the feelings one had when listening to music that was about story telling AND musicianship!
B00097DX3U|5.0|In my opinion, Out of Exile is the best Audioslave album because it is good throughout. Audioslave kicked it up a notch and released a very good album that stands alone among the rest of their albums.
B000641Z90|5.0|It was super great.  It is a two disk set with mostly all concert.  Too bad it is their last concert as an original band.  Also funny special feature.  Worth every penny!
B002VPE1WK|1.0|I researched for a while to see what backpack I would want to buy.. decided on this one. It is very small, cant fit my cameras or lenses, it is cheaply made...Save your money and buy another one.
B002IR3PSC|1.0|I gave to friend.  He did not like a all.  Only a very little time looking at concert.  Mostly very old songs and cd I have had for too many years to count  I play flute and have been a fan for ever.  I[m 56 years old so that is a long time as a fan.

B00846TRHY|5.0|I hadn't really seen too much about this movie before watching it, but it's really good. Plus it has Gerard Butler...I mean, seriously!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is awesome for time passing and is very addicting and entertaining!!! I recommend this game to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!
1932100660|4.0|Very informative and has changed my views on what I should eat going forward. Definitely recommend this book for those looking to make a permanent lifestyle change.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game manages to be meditative and stimulating at the same time. It simultaneously uses the part of the mind that problem solves and calms. Addictive.
B0055S348W|1.0|been trying to print from gmail on kindle fire. No luck. Don't waste your money on this app if you own a KINDLE. Where can j go to get my $13 dollars back?
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Excellent price for one of the best music groups in history! Better than buying cd....twenty songs for 4.99 is a deal!
B0053JJLLC|5.0|This was excellent.  I enjoyed entering into the micro world of this earth.  It is a wonderful and beautiful place.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love, love, love this series!!! Recommend to anyone who wants very good books, well written books! I could reread these over and over again!! Love it...
B007THA4FI|1.0|I  was disappointed with J.K.Rowling's adult novel.  She should stick with Harry Potter or choose another character with magical charms.
B00947N6UG|5.0|My husband and I got this movie for the grandkids but we love it just as much as they do!  It has a good storyline and great effects.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|Not as smooth as I would like.  It kept stopping and freezing.  Then would start again.  I have the kindle fire and really expected better.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Gibbs is unmatched-Ziva is smart sexy passionate-Tony is a clown with good cop instincts-Magee & Abby made for each other-Ducky is ducky
0142403873|5.0|This is currently on heavy rotation and I love reading it as well. The parts where you get a description of the Gruffalo before you meet him are my favorites. \\"Knobby knees, turned out toes, and a poisonous wart at the end of his nose\\" are all times when I would touch my son's knee, toes and nose to add emphasis to the story. Now he does it himself when I read those and the other descriptive parts. Oh so cute!<br /><br />It may be that the sole person (thus far as of this review) who has given this book one star probably didn't read the book with vim and vigor, as the book has several characters where you can change your voice to portray each animal. Not that it's a prerequisite to change your voice, but I suspect many parents do some sort of accent and voice inflection to give the story more appeal to the young listeners on their laps.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|First heard this in 1967 in Frankfurt Germany - was great then and has gotten better with age if that is possible
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|never got to see the movie. The movie would not boot upvery disappointed I hope I'll have not been charged
B00125WAWS|5.0|Denzel Washington is amazing.<br />This movie is truly inspirational.<br />a MUST watch!<br />Based on a true story . One of Denzel's greatest movies...
1594487154|4.0|I have read half the book and so far, it has met my expectations. Daniel Pink makes great points and helped me to see how much everyone plays a role in sales.
0385335997|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I have read all 6 (or maybe 7) books and decided that I actually wanted copies for my personal library.  Diana Gabaldon turns history into an exciting, page-turner.  I never learned so much about one country before.  I highly recommend these books to all.
B0006LZPKS|5.0|Great for on land or on deck, these shoes also protect your toes from on deck hardware. They are comfortable for all day wear.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Batman and his new allies (catwoman & Robin) manage to overcome his most dangerous and credible opponent to date, but at the cost of Batman's life. Somehow I doubt this will be the end of the franchise, but it was still an enjoyable way to spend two hours and in the best traditions of the Batman series.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|Great action movie to watch. Makes you hope police do a better job in finding the right person who did the crime.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Sometimes the documentary format is the best way to tell a story, especially when the facts are as extraordinary as the ones surrounding this story.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Very happy with this watch,everyone likes it .Great price ,looks and feels good.I would recommend this watch to any age group.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I was not  too sure about this one, but I have lost 5 lbs and did not find it that hard..  Discovered That you can do something every week for two days without feeling too deprived
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I had always hesitated in watching this movie.  As an avid Jane Austen fan, I was somewhat distracted by the DVD cover depicting Emma as Cupid.  Once you get to the movie you have a much different experience.  I enjoyed the settings, the interpretation of the story.  Gwyneth Paltrow did a marvelous Emma, socially intelligent but at times humanly ignorant.  Mr. Knightly was my favorite as always.  I enjoyed this look at him and found it comparable to the movie with Kate Beckinsale as Emma.  Each movie has its own look and charms.<br />I think it is wise to govern your feelings about any of the movies as they are products of the director's mind.  The best Emma &#34;movie&#34; is to grab a cup of coffee and curl up with the book and let your imagination take the lead.  We should not expect that another's interpretation should match the intention and work of Jane Austen as much as our own or our own viewpoints.  She had many messages in all of her work but Emma really is delightful in every view.<br />If you just compare the movies of Emma with each other you only have a small slice of Jane Austen's world.  You compare the characters the way it ought to be....with the others.  As Maryann said in &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34;, &#34; I compare my conduct with yours (Elinor), the way it ought to be.&#34;  And for me, the comments will be thus.  Emma in any way is delightful, entertaining and makes you smile.  Indeed...a wonderful surprise.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I loved the other  books from this author but this one was almost horrible. I hated all of the characters which made it hard to finish, it was like I didn't care what happened to any of them. I do not recommend this book but I do recommend the other books by Gillian Flynn.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It reminds me of temple run but it is easier and it fit for the younger generation.it is fun because you can be anyone from boys to girls to robots or even a zombie.it is free and works on most devices ,it is a fun way yo consume time and it might get quite addicting for people who love apps with swift moves and jumping or surfing and even dodging trains.my favorite part is when I get the mystery box or a booster of such because they really make the game interesting.it is good for people who have some what of an internet connection. I recommend this for children 8 and up.<br />What is their more to say ,this is such a wonderful app 5 stars in all
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My grandson and i have been playing this game for a month now.  I am addicted.  I can't seem to put it down..the challenges presented are great.  I have slowly figured out small little things on the game to make advances while my grandson figures out others.  I recommend it highly
B000OWAFPE|3.0|My son loves the music. Nice story but I hate the liberal propaganda earth hugging crap.I don't believe in brainwashing kids.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|It is a really good solid thrash metal album. Loved it.  Testament always delivers the good. Brings memories of the late 80's and early 90's.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I keep updating hoping to find some of what I think is essential for reading an ebook, but Kindle doesn't have what I need yet.<br /><br />I want to be able to choose my own font.  I find it very difficult to read in a serif font, but I can't change it.<br /><br />I want to be able to choose left justification.  If you need a large font full justification leaves too much space between words especially if you read on a small device.<br /><br />I want to be able to choose my font size.  The difference in sizes really jumps too much.  If I could choose the font size by number it would really help.<br /><br />Without even these basics, I don't find it very useful.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|At free, I'm not too mad. If I had paid, I'd say someone was trying to sell a computer programming school project yo pay off some loans. on the HTC DNA, the controls are so small you can barely play the game. I tried tilt controls, though, the pedal buttons were way to small.<br /><br />keep it up, you have the makings of a good programmer, although this needs better controls.  Maybe a bunch of zombies to run over too. (even running and screaming crowds as you fail and wipe out a Parisian sidewalk cafe would help.)

B008TRUDAS|5.0|At the moment, it seems that all the awesome books that I have read are in the \\"New Adult\\" category as recently I went through a bit of a book reading jam where nothing seemed to work , so I was put onto Andrea Randall's Into the Stillness and loved it. So what I have decided to do was go through my list to read and finally read books that have been sitting on my Ipad and read them . So up first was Colleen Hoover's book \\"Slammed\\" the first in a series of three which I have book #2 and book#3 is relesed pretty soon. Like most of the indie authors I have read , I had heard ALOT about this book from the facebook group I belong to called BA as the author is also a member of the group. All I really knew about it was that it contained slam poetry and it was a great book, that's it. So I opened the book and started reading and met the two main characters Layken and Will. Lake as she is known as has just moved with her mum Julia and brother Kel from Texas to Michigan , Will is her hunky next door neighbour who lives with his brother Caulder who turns out to be Kel's age. Lake and Will have an awesome three days then Lake starts school only to discover that the guy she is falling in love with is her English Teacher - total Aria and Ezra Fitz moment here.  Like most books, the two can't really be together and fight it but no matter what happens their love can't keep them apart. The thing though that I loved about this book was that it wasn't just another soppy love story , Will teaches his English class all about Poetry and Slamming and takes them as part of their class assignment to a Slam Night at a club and the students perform their works. This made me tear up as some of the poems read were amazing and heartfelt. Soon Lake's life will be flipped upside down as she learns a dark secret from her mother , will she be able to cope ? In this part, not to give it away. All I will say is I love her brother Kel as he comes up with the most awesome things and he really did make me smile and reminded me of my brother Zach.  The other thing that this book left me thinking was \\"OMG I so need to go to a Poetry Slam Night now\\".<br /><br />So for an awesome read and first glance into the lives of Will and Lake , check out Slammed by Colleen Hoover.e smile and reminded me of my brother Zach.  The other thing that this book left me thinking was \\"OMG I so need to go to a Poetry Slam Night now\\".<br /><br />So for an awesome read and first glance into the lives of Will and Lake , check out Slammed by Colleen Hoover.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It is easy to see why the movie was awarded so many Academy Awards. We had our doubts as we usually don't watch animal movies. We did not know what it was about. It was a wonderful story. Grabbed our attention immediately.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I don't know if there is a second part but this one is undiminished unfinished. It was poorly constructed and all over the place with no structure or base. I apologize if I offended any of the fans or the author.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives you a good view of the story.  If you are a military fan or a fan of the Navy SEALS you already bought this.  If you are not familiar with our elite war fighters this is a good introduction.  Not as good as 'American Sniper' but get both and enjoy.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Not the best but not the worst book I have ever read. A little slow to get started with a great middle but a less than ideal ending. Kind of let me wondering why I read it till the end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book.  It is the best account of a Navy SEAL that I have read to date.  The author, Chris Kyle, was killed recently while trying to help a fellow soldier suffering from PTSD.  Please buy this book and support his family and get to know the people defending this nation.
B002XZOZQA|5.0|this is a favorite movie from my childhood when I did a lot of theater. Brought back great memories for me
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in a while.  It feels real.  I know it is not perfect and I see that they had to take some artistic license but it put the hunt for UBL in an accessible package.  The actual raid work was very good.  I saw a few operational items that looked a bit incorrect but on the whole I really liked the feel of the assault.  It is in your face and tells a story that needs to be told.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence was a superb character in this movie.Intriging and horrifying.great survival instincts,it was a hit at our house.<br />.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I record audio on a daily basis, so I'm quite picky about my sound quality.<br /><br />When I record a person's voice for video, I work alone and have no assistant to hold a boom mic for me.<br />The ATR-3350 is perfect for my needs. Its recording performance is wonderful, and the long cord allows camera connection at a good distance.<br /><br />There's no on/off indicator light, so be sure the switch is in off position when not in use.<br />Inserting the tiny battery properly is challenging, but who's complaining?<br /><br />For the price-conscious video interviewer or filmmaker, having a couple of these and a pair of ZOOM H1's would be very wise!<br />No regrets here.<br /><br />- Jamile Byrd
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this everyday. It's very addictive so beware. Lol. I have had this game on my Kindle since Dec 2011 but played it for years on Facebook. The only negative thing I could say is that I wish we got more daily credits and could accept more than 5 credits a day from teammates.  But other than that I LOVE BB!  You won't regret getting this game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game Just wish the credits didn't go so fast! Its a very addicting game! It does freeze up a lot but not sure if its my ta let or the game!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Initially this game proved very entertaining and addictive.  Was able to move up evolutionary chain of sharks with ease and skill. Then noticed gains disappeared.  Today Megalodon and previous stats, missions and museum are all gone and game is reset to meko level. All purchased and earned items also gone. Not first time game has reset level but first time things totally gone. Game seems to reset every couple days as I have opened treasure chest for days 1-5 numerous times. Good game when it works but too inconsistent. For these reasons one star.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game but wished you could restart the game. Also be able to go further faster. Glad I did get the game for free.
B00A83075M|5.0|My family and I were pleasantly surprised by how fun this movie was! We saw it in the theater and just knew we had to get it when it came out on DvD. The story is relatable and the writing makes it enjoyable for both kids and adults. Terrific annimation and voice acting as well. Highly recommended! My 10 and 5 year old daughters LOVE it, it's not just for little boys. So many movies are geared just for girls or just for boys, and I think Wreck-It Ralph strikes a great balance. Also, the kids might not get it, but my husband and I loved the homage to old-school gaming: Fix-It Felix is a fun wink to games like Donkey Kong, and Qubert makes an appearance as himself - too fun!
B00B47NO2O|5.0|I'm not a person who watches much tv but I have seen all the episodes of the Following. I love this tv show because it's action packed and exciting plus the acting is amazing (especially Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy). If you're looking for a realistic show though, this is not it. On the other hand, if you think \\"realistic\\" police procedural shows are boring like I do, you'll enjoy this one. Yes, there are a lot of killings but they keep the action going. That said, if gore and violence disturb you, again, it's not for you. By the way, if the FBI was as \\"smart\\" as some people think they should be in this show and figured things out quickly, there wouldn't be enough content for a full season, as the killer would have already been captured. The FBI's failures keep the show going and honestly, officials are human and make mistakes in real life situations too.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|Other reviewers may disagree with my review of this film but, it all depends what your likes and tastes are.  First, the film is based on a true story and gives the viewer what L.A. was like in the 40's.  Lots of neat 'period' shots and a story line that; although could have had a 'Hollywood'; ending, presents one that is based on fact, and still brings closure.  Josh Brolin does a great job, as does all the cast.  Only complaint is some of the scenes are a bit dark (underlit) and the dialog can get covered up by the background tracks.  Think of this as the prequel to L.A. Confidential.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Always nice to read and refreshing to study comforting and guiding through the dark fears as you go along life journey.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BAND. There is no end of fun in this CD, it's amazing to listen to, has SO many good songs.
B005LZW8FO|3.0|While I didn't find this film a complete waste of time, it left far too many questions for my busy mind to hash over for hours afterward.<br /><br />Possible Spoiler Alert:<br />Since the plot has aready been discussed here many times I'lk skip it and just go on with how I felt. I could connect with the chacter of Rhoda in the sense of feeling so lost and empty over things that happened in the past that you simply can not change. I had the feeling that if she would have had the chance to explain herself to John when she wanted to originally, it would have been met in a worse manor than it eventually is. She feels that she wants to do the right thing but hasn't figured out yet at her young age that sometimes things are best left alone to be dealt with on your own. Her developing friendship and eventual love for him and him for her I could understand because you had two very \\"lost soul\\" kind of people that were drawn to each other, each for their own reasons. At that point Rhoda should have never told him who she really was. It did seem self-serving and only done to ease her own mind at that point. How did she expect him to react knowing that he had had sex with the woman who killed his family?<br /><br />What bothered me the most was how Earth 2 was such a back story that we never really learn (unless I missd it while I ran to the bathroom)when or how did it materialize. Did everyone just wake up one morning and there was a mirror image of the earth? Since I never saw more than one moon, was there a second moon or was that our moon with the new earth between us? Of course, that adds the questions of lunar pull, tides, gravity and a plethora of other questions wide open that never get answered. I wanted to know these things and that alone would make a great sci-fi film without the Rhoda-John storyline.<br /><br />It also brings up the question of did the same drawing take place on Earth 2, with Rhoda winning and coming here to Earth 1 to find her other self. That would have left 2 John's on Earth 2 since it appeared from Rhoda's dress that she must have gone to MIT and her life went as planned without the accident causing the death of John's family. The whole quantum physics/parallel realities theory freaks me out enough as it is. What if suddenly four more earths would have just popped into exisitence?<br /><br />I did find it an interesting Indie film that left far too many questions even for a film that wanted people to think afterward and come up with possible ending scenarios on their own. While I do enjoy films that leave something to think about at the end, this one left me thinking far too much about far too much.
B005LJKEXS|1.0|I bought this to for extending the range of my rudimentary security camera, a 720p logitech webcam.

The vandalism has stopped since it's installation.<br /><br />EDIT: Female end stopped working after less than a week. Unplugged and replugged camera MAYBE 5 times. . . . . . Piece-o-junk.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I have seen this movie, which was originally a book, many times and deeply enjoyed it so I thought I would buy the book as well and see how they compared. Let me say that the book, is much different from the movie but was just as enjoyable. As it seems to happen in Hollywood, the storyline was changed a lot, you have to look at them as two seperate things that have a few things in common. The movie is quite different from the book as far as the characters and even the story line, to an extent, but each has it's own charm and beauty. I loved them both and both make me want to visit India. If the Marigold Hotel did indeed exist, I think I could retire there and be happy.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Although it is exerts taken from multiple points of view as opposed to one single characters battle through the war it is still a great read. I like it a lot!
B009MO57H6|3.0|The fifth film in the series, resident Evil: Retribution tries to tie up all the loose ends and introduces some new twists.  We learn that Alice is one of the 50 models that The Umbrella Corporation lieks to re-use which raises the question is Alice herself a clone because she keeps returning with the same bruise on her shoulder and trouble remembering what happened.<br /><br />This movie starts where the fourth movies ends, the battle against the re-programmed Valentine and hosprey soldiers.  Alice survive but is captured again by The Umbrella Corporation and taken to their main trainign and programming complex in Russia.  This time, she is freed by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), a former Umbrella agent who is now working with the now=rebel Wesker (Shawn Roberts).  Alice and Ada are helped by a rescue team led by Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Erb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand) and Alice's friend, turned rebel, Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) from the previous movie.  We also see that one of Alice's clones has just been killed in a simulated zombie attack and has a programmed deaf daughter, Becky (one of the 50 clone models).  The two women must make their way through a series of five simulation-settings featuring hordes of more intelligent zombies, giant axemen, and mutated monsters and meet up with the rescue team.  Complicating this story is the fact that the re-started and murderous mother computer, the Red Queen has sent Valentine and a killsquad comprised of previously-dead characters - Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), and James \\"One\\" Shade (Colin Salmon)who have returned via cloning to kill them. There is also a \\"Good Rain\\" who aids Alice and her 'daughter.' Alice dispatches the Evil Rain and frees Valentine from The Umbrella Corporation control.<br /><br />The movie ends with the survivors, Alice, Ada Wong, Becky, and Leon are rescued and taken to Washington DC where Wesker who has been able to control the T-virus with a serum developed from Alice's blood is leading the remaining humans in a final stand against the zombie horde programmed by the artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen.  Alice who has been without her superpowers since the end of the third movie gets them back when Wesker re-injects her with the T-virus.  He asks her to help them in the final battle.<br /><br />The movie explodes with many gunfights, stellar FX, huge body counts, gadgetry and beautiful photography.  This is a feast for the eyes but it is pure action with some twists thrown in to keep your mind processing some facts.  This is the fourth best of the series but it still holds up well.  The endless continuing plot for another movie is getting tedious and Alice's opening monologue in which she once again recounts her story is getting old.  Milla Jovovich returns with gusto and delivers another strong performance but the end is on the horizon.s blood is leading the remaining humans in a final stand against the zombie horde programmed by the artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush continues be a group that can transend decades.  This is a great album that sounds a lot like thier older albums.  Just amazing!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I don't watch a series until at least two seasons have been released. Then I am careful to cull reviews from &#34;every day people.&#34; rather than what is written by the critics. I was going to take a LONG plane ride so I figured that downtime would give me an excellent opportunity to watch the first season in one fell swoop (as I like to do).<br /><br />I have to say I was impressed with the story line and level of detail from the first minute. It's not very often that the title sequence IS IMPORTANT. I watched it a few times to make sure that I had my &#34;geography&#34; down. I am VERY picky with any type of &#34;story that takes place in an ancient land with knights, armor and horses&#34; but I didn't find myself rolling my eyes at all. The actors have bad teeth and look &#34;grubby enough&#34; for this type of land. My only gripe is that the &#34;barbarian king guy&#34; looks like he's been visiting GNC and 24 Hour Fitness more than doing &#34;real world strength-training.&#34; No one has nice skin and perfect pecs like that in a hunter-gatherer culture (or enough protein!). But I digress...<br /><br />To give an example of other shows I enjoy: Dexter, American Horror Story: Asylum. The Sopranos, Mad Men. I enjoy good writing and a certain level of violence. Give this series a shot, but don't watch it if you can't PAY ATTENTION. It's not for glancing up at while you're folding the laundry. THERE WILL BE A TEST :).
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is some of the best television I have ever watched!  This a great series.  I can't wait for more!
B005KMX866|5.0|I ordered this for my Mom.  She heard him do 'Great Balls of Fire' and liked it much better than the Jerry Lee Lewis version, so she had to have it.  I found it on this cd along with a lot of other songs I knew she would like,  so I bought it.  She Loves It!!!!!!!!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Action packed, great special effects, witty and funny.  Not a perfect movie, but even during one particular shake-my-head totally ridiculously impossible 'operation' scene, the movie had me laughing when it wanted me to.  Very well done.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Was a really cute movie - had some good humor and made us laugh. Cool concept. Would definitely watch it again!

B003B02OQ4|5.0|Grisham addresses the legal scene, but manages in presenting new and interesting characters with keeping the reader on the edge of their seat!  The Grisham novel has not disappointed me yet - and I have read most if not all.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|After reading this who doesn't want to live in a small town in North Carolina.  Great story line...everyone deserves this type of happy ending.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|I know, I know, it's a \\"check your brain at the door\\" kind of movie. I don't even mind those kinds of movies, as long as the acting and dialogue aren't painful. This movie? Yeah, the acting and dialogue are painful.<br /><br /> The main character is played by a man who I have witnessed acting in other things. I know he can act, he just needs a better director and script. The girlfriend? A swimsuit model who is now an \\"actress.\\" I guess jiggling the goods onscreen is acting now? My acting professors would disagree. I disagree. The disabled vet and the old-time war heroes? Come on. I know you want to lend some authenticity, but putting non-actors on the screen and having them woodenly utter memorized dialogue is just awful to watch. As background actors? Fine. As actual characters who utter lines? HELL NO.<br /><br /> Peter Berg: Please, for the love of all that is good in movies, STOP COPYING MICHAEL BAY. Bay had an excellent popcorn movie style a decade ago before he started overusing all of his signature shots. If you want to emulate Bay at his best, watch The Rock and go from there. Transformers? No. Just, no.<br /><br /> The highlights of the film consist of Liam Neeson as an Admiral and the cool looking alien ships. And...., yeah, no, that was it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was recommended this book by someone at work.  I started to read it and thought I was too old for it since it was a high school senior and I have a high school junior and senior of my own.  I loved it and quickly forgot about my age.  I would recommend it to others as a quick read because I read it so quickly since I couldn't put it down.

B000059MEL|4.0|What to say about the band. The product is good. It had minor wear and tear, probably due to storage and transport but nothing major. A great addition to the collection.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is includes action, suspense, and drama.  The movie is about teenagers battling each other in an annual game to death.  It is gruesome, and reminds me of Lord of the Flies.

B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I'm sure there's a deeper message to this movie, and forgive me for not submitting my brain to a second or third viewing to try and find it, but after one pass, there wasn't a single lasting impression.  Yes, the acting was terrific, but acting simply for acting's sake is an attempt at futility.  Perhaps the actor's paychecks would disagree, but if that's the case, then this is art for the sake of the artist and I have no interest in satisfying their egos.<br />I've read plenty of critiques that tried to draw out the underlying themes.  Unfortunately, all these would-be educators were able to offer was enlightened conjecture.<br />Take a pass on this one.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I honestly did not think I would enjoy this game from initial impressions.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!  A fantastic JRPG battle system that is COMPLETELY customizable, a set of excellent characters with wonderful depth, and a beautiful world to explore and play.  So much to do- so little time!  Its what you want a virtual life to be when youre playing a game (FUN).<br /><br />What a great experience and only possible on the beautiful vita's screen and excellent control scheme.

B003O5MO6G|5.0|The Byrds 4th album \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\", is a rock 'n roll classic, and on this remastered version you get 17 great slices of pop,country,psychedelic space rock.  Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman, Michael Clarke and David Crosby  with some help from future Byrd Clarence White, were spot on.<br />Chris Hillman really came into his own here also, with such notable tunes in,\\"Have You Seen Her Face\\",  \\"Time Between\\", which he later played in his 80's and 90's band The Desert Rose Band, \\"Thoughts And Words\\" and \\"The Girl With No Name\\".  Crosby gave us \\"Mind Gardens\\", the unforgettable \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" , \\"Renaissance Fair\\", and the brilliant \\"Lady Friend\\", sadly David was kicked out of the band during their next album \\"Notorious Byrd Brothers\\".  McGuinn gave us the fluffy \\"Don't Make Waves\\", which is quite good, the space rock of \\"C.T.A.-102\\" and the McGuinn, Hillman hit \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'N' Roll Star\\" and they also covered \\"Why\\" again which also appeared on \\"5D\\", the year before.  They also covered Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\", a hit also, great bass by Chris Hillman here.  The Byrds to me are one of the great groups in rock and roll history.

B000FCK65W|5.0|So thankful my daughter suggested this book on her blog. Betty Smith has an uncanny way of writing that brings you right into the story, helping you see life as she experienced it growing up in a poor, struggling family. The characters are rich, not hiding their flaws, but also showing the good in those many would label and write off. Worth taking the time to read, even if done in snatches, you can pick up where you left off and immediately be drawn back into the story.

0345536886|2.0|When I purchased this book I was all too excited to sit down and read this installment from one of my favorite authors.  I was disappointed at the inability for this book to grab and hold my attention.  When I find a good book, it is hard for me to put it down...I was hard-pressed to \\"find time\\" to read this slow-paced tale. It seemed the author was too busy \\"painting\\" the setting and not enough time capturing the reader's intrigue at the start. But, that would be hard to do with these uninteresting characters. Slow out the gate and never caught up.
B006VA57CY|5.0|I'll say the same thing I said about Season 1: \\"The entire series is incredibly well written and well-acted! The characters are uniquely interesting and the character development across the 3 seasons (thus far) is phenomenal! The story line is solid and the drama unfolding in the house of Downton Abbey, between the \\"upstairs\\" and the \\"downstairs\\" was so well done. You'll go back and forth with characters you like and then dislike and then like again. It's definitely an emotional roller coaster.\\"<br /><br />Was it the same quality as Season 1? Not at first. Season 1 was above and beyond all standard of expectations I ever had and the initial few episodes of Season 2 had to bring all of us down from that \\"high\\" in order to set the stage for other and better events later on in the season and in Season 3. Also, I think the general historical period they covered in Season 2 was a bit difficult (WWI), but they captured it well and it definitely set the stage for the end of this series and Season 3. As a whole, Downton Abbey is by far my FAVORITE TV series (above any and all movies) EVER!!!

I cried like a baby--many times!--not something I do often in movies/TV shows, either.<br /><br />When I first heard about Downton Abbey, I had no idea what it was about and it frankly didn't look interesting nor anything like my typical movie/TV preference (sci-fi/fantasy). But I watched the entire first season in one sitting! I just couldn't stop! I had to pace myself for the other two seasons because I wasn't ready to patiently \\"wait around\\" for Season 4 (didn't work ;-)).

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I purchased this game because I was teasing my sister about spending so much time on it.  Now my mom and I are just as addicted as she is.
0199537151|3.0|It was ok I had to read it for my English class.  It is not something that I would have chosen to read
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I've completed this game but I go back and reset it and play some more, I just enjoy the game and it gives me a nice mental challenge every time, good for the brain.
0441020712|2.0|I am a huge fan of Alastair Reynolds, but two thirds of the way through, I'm sick of this book. Blue Remembered Earth is an account of a very slow, not very interesting interplanetary treasure hunt. I don't like any of the characters. Geoffrey, in particular, is hard to stomach. Almost every interaction is filled with uninteresting snark and resentment, but it is not at all clear why he should be resentful.<br /><br />Reynolds is astonishingly imaginative, and his prose is top notch. But this book is a miss. I'm not even sure I'll finish it.
B00ASIT208|2.0|Two stars for the beauty of the movie, shots, and scenes...but ending was crap...and I mean crap. Unless you can look passed it, don't bother. It will bring you down
B000002B35|5.0|This album is live best of Pink Floyd album. So if you are a fan this is a must album.<br />Also saw Brit Floyd (THE Tribute Band) do this concert live and many of the riffs were better than the original. So I would check them both out as well as this DVD and You Tube sample.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Works very well.  There are so many different options I haven't had a chance to try them all out. Very nice!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book - regardless of whether you are an animal lover, you will enjoy this bittersweet story told by the perspective of a dog.  I could not put it down.  It certainly pulls at your heartstrings and reminds you about the power of unconditional friendship and love.
0812983459|5.0|It was an amazing story and I could hardly put it down.<br />The character of Harold touched my heart and of course<br />the description of the places he walked to was wonderful.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Good game but would be better with a no time limit option for tablets and Kindle Fire.  Maybe with the next update?
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love using the mp3 service from amazon ,I ordered two CDs and was able to download both albums immediately . Now they are on my phone so I can listen anytime I want. The CDs even showed up earlier than I expected . This service is great for people that want to listen to CDs at home and on the go with their mobile devices.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|WALKING DEAD REALLY MAKES ONE THINK ABOUT WHEN AND IF ANYTHING BAD WERE TO REALLY HAPPEN, WHAT WOULD SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE.  FUN SEASON
B005QPGHQU|3.0|I am a so so fan of this band and enjoyed the first few albums and decided to add this one to my collection, No complaints. This one  only gets 3 stars because it didn't really breakthrough to anything new; but I like it!
B008NEMN0K|1.0|All I got out of this movie was a black man shooting<br />intelligent white Robots. Now that it is in 3d we can see the killing's of intelligent white robots close hand.<br />Gee, Thanks.
B0011Z3334|4.0|This album has been out for a long while, but at this point I only owned 2 of the tracks because my initial listening to it didn't convince me to buy the whole CD. I found this in the $5 MP3 section recently and decided to get it. So far I have enjoyed listening to the entire album and really like Hayley's vocals. Great Album, I give it 4 stars.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Such a great movie. Richard Gere is a big time lawyer who use to work for the DA's office and is now jumped the fence to start arguing for the criminals. He takes a case pro bono for soft spoken Aaron(Ed Norton) after being arrested for the murder of the archbishop who is loved by everyone in town. Of course he is going up against his former colleague at the DA's office still and former lover. After taking the case it keeps taking more turns that dont add up for Gere;and as he keeps digging for the truth he finds a darkside to his client, the archbishop, alter boys and even people he use to work with at the DA's office. Great plot with great actors bringing it to the surface. Ed Norton has you cheering for him, even when you start to find out his secret; and at the end the truth finally comes out!
B000KADH2S|5.0|[...]<br /><br />I am not sure when this book even got to my bookshelf - but when I stumbled across it I immediately had two conflicting emotions.  1) I need to read this and 2) I don't want to read this.<br /><br />As a young school girl, I did a lot of in depth research into concentration camps; listening to recordings, reading newspaper clippings, and getting really in depth research assistance and guidance from my parents.  I was worried that I would miss my parents too much to read about a sad story.<br /><br />However, it is this research that blossomed in me my love for stories, and critical research.  Go big or Go Home... as my dad used to say when I asked if I was doing too much for my project assignment.<br /><br />The title itself also concerned me - is this a concentration camp and a therapy book?  Even thought I wasn't prepared - the answer is yes.<br /><br />Frankl is as explicit as he needs to be in the first half of the book - his story from the labor camps.  He wrote it in 9 days and hoped to published it anonymously.  He agreed to put his name on it not for ego - but for truth.<br /><br />The Introduction mentions that a person's copy will be dog earned and marked for paragraphs that will leap into a reader's soul.<br /><br />I am impressed with the author's humility - he describes the terrible showers, but just stating, \\"enough has been written now that describe these showers, there is no need\\" to put a reader through that again.  I am impressed with his optimism and self awareness, his description of beauty and kindness, the general care humans give one another even when there is nothing to gain.  There are good and bad people in all groups of people.  Hope is arriving at camp with an unpublished manuscript (on logotherapy) in your pocket and asking SS guards to save it for you and then writing key bits and pieces on small scraps over the years to eventually publish it and many more books.  Meaning is different for each of us - our meaning is tohelp others finds theirs.<br /><br />I am moved by his words, images, and pauses.  At one point, he seems to look up, call out, and inquire about a friend of his from the camp that he doesn't know what happened to - will he ever read this?<br /><br />I can only ask that you do.<br /><br />Jessica Pettitt is the \\"diversity educator\\" your family warned you about. Through teaching, writing, and facilitating tough conversations, she has figured out how to BE the change she wants to BE. Now it is your turn!<br />As she travels around the country, you can catch up with Jessica on: <br /><br />Facebook: [...] <br />YouTube: [...] <br />LinkedIn: [...] <br />Twitter: [...]
1557048630|5.0|Dreamworks has always puts out great artbooks and this one is no exception, very detailed about how they came up with character designs and storyboards to the environment and tone of the movie.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This was an amazing installment to the Sigma Force novel series.  I couldn't put the book down it was a riveting page turner.  Rollins has a unique and fascinating was of weaving historical fact with fiction.  It's like he knows he has you and you're so hooked you can't stop reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun and also it is very addictive. you totally lose track of time while playing and four hours will feel like four minutes. time flies when you're having fun!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|The browser works Whit the Kindle Fire HD. As you know mobile devices don't have flash player. I wanted it with my Kindle and Dolphin was one of the apps that helped me with that.
B000065U1N|5.0|This product came in good condition and I am very happy with this purchase. I love this movie and recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i read the book in a day, it was amazing. i laughed, i cried, it's by far one of my favorites.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre, nice and brutal. True to the original but then taking it a step further
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|These books will never date or get old I am enjoying reading again as much as first time.  Brilliantly written.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like this app so much better...finally an app that is more like the real program. I wouldn't like to try it on a phone-definitely wonderful for my Kindle.
B005HCI72O|5.0|I read this series of books when they were first published over 10years ago.  I returned to them now and are enjoying rediscovering the world of Claire and Jamie.  Just as good if not better this time
B0036R92V2|3.0|The Amazon Editorial Review is not for this film. It is for the NEW DJANGO UNCHAINED this is an older version about a white guy no racial bigotry.
B009AMANBA|5.0|If you love history and biography's....you will love this film.  Everytime I have wathed it I see a little something I missed the first time.  Daniel Day Lewis and sally Field are superb.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This is a great book and all but could be more understandable but over all I think it helps me with words I never heard

B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read Mockingjay next.  Love Suzanne Collins imagination and the way she brings the characters to life so well that I felt their joy, sadness & pain as though I knew them intimately.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Too much wisdom and too many points to ponder for one read thru.  Buy it and keep it to return to often.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|What a great book. Thank you college Hoover for making this story it was amazing so much better than what i expected. Beautifully written.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I had a smile on my face the whole time I was reading Bossypants.  Tina Fey reveals herself to be a thoughtful, smart, caring person and, of course, funny to boot.  This book is organized as a series of vignettes and essays, arranged in chronological order.  It includes stories from her childhood, college years, comedy troupe days, SNL, 30 Rock, motherhood, and Sarah Palin.  There's good advice for working women trying to succeed in an industry dominated by men, as well as working mom and motherhood stories that many of us can relate to.<br /><br />I liked it very much and definitely recommend it for a light and enjoyable read.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|DOUBLE WOW FOR THIS ONE!!! I hesitated at first after reading some negative reviews, people having trouble with their screens freezing, etc. So far that has not happened to me. This app is a magazine/news junkie's paradise. I never knew there were that many specialty magazines and newspapers, and having so much fun trying them out. Perfect if you have a few minutes to kill and you have time to read a quick article. Content changes and updates constantly, so there's no danger of your having to say oh, i already read that one, because the articles are different all the time. Haven't had the app long enough to really personalize it yet. Also I am not on twitter or facebook but I am still totally able to get maximum use from this app. Try it out!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Me and my child have these on our tablets and we both love them.  There is a variety for all.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|it is the best game in the world. when I first got this game I though it would be for baby's but I was wrong .do not pay any attention to any of the poeple that put bad. reviews for this game.!!!!!!!!!!!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I've never had the words to explane the second handers but now do. realy opend my mind to our world. pophetic.
0140557741|4.0|My kids love this book.  At first they were confused because there were no words, but it gave a great oppportunity to explain a concept of perspective to them.  When they get older it will still be great to teach that from even a more philosophical level.  One fun thing that we love to do is to read the book forwards (where you &#34;zoom&#34; out each page), and then to read it backwards  - they get a real kick out of that and now want to do it both ways everytime, which really reinforces the learnings!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My kid plays this and loves it. He constantly asks if he can check on his Dragons so I use it as a tool to get him to finish his homework or do a chore, THEN he can check on them.
B00985E3UG|5.0|A book that requires you to question how much power you think you really have about choosing the food you eat. I gave 5 stars because it is such a well written eye-opener that exposes the power that the food giants have over what you are eating.  Hoping that people read and make wiser choices.
0425252868|5.0|By not &#34;pulling the trigger&#34; on defenseless airman, this German pilot (not a Nazi) saved them & generations to come.  A well researched accounting of pilots on both sides.  Anyone who wants a soldier personal story of war history will appreciate all that is written.  A fast read with photos of the many characters.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like having an app that sorts out all my bookmarks and organizes them.  It's not just my bookmarks though, it's all the bookmarks that other people have found and then share with the Pinterest Community.  I think it's a great way to harness all the info on the internet in an organized place.  It's the last thing I read at night and don't know how I got along without it.  One thing I would advise though is to really think about your boards when you are first starting out.  I wish I had made my boards more specific.  Now after thousands of pins,  I'm sorting some of my boards out and it is taking some time. I also would advise new users to make sure a pin actually takes you to the person or website who should get the credit for the pin and has the instructions for the pin if that is what you are trying to link to with your pin.  I didn't know these things when I started using the app and it would have helped to have known these things.
0753541637|3.0|it s ok. some of it might not apply to general population but it has many good points.<br />would recommend
B00BDSRISA|3.0|I've always liked this band. They are obviously talented. But this time around they've intentionality mixed the synth tracks to the point of fuzzy distortion.  That's fine on one track for that effect, but almost all of the tracks?  Egads.  I suspect they were trying for a \\"live early 1980's sound\\" that tried to make the keyboards sound \\"loud.\\" On the plus side, the singing is spot on.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I love this book right from the start. Recommended it to my Irish friend. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Thanks so much. A nice change from all the violence we read today.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|Yo La Tengo has always experimented with different sounds and of course, that is part of their appeal.  This time around, the band seems more focused than usual on melodic tracks, lots of fuzzy guitar, and harmony.  It all works exceedingly well.  All of the tracks are quietly memorable and stand up over frequent listens.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game and free. I have been playing for hours and cant get enough. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|It came exactly as advertised; shipment was timely and the color was right on.  Also, it fit my Kindle Fire like a glove.  I'm very satisfied.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I didn't know what to expect, having hardly seen a preview or 2 of this movie months ago. This book is written very simply,and was sweet and even amusing.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|As a whole music experience it's not bad, especially compared with other music coming out now, however it is not his best work. It's good background music while doing other things, but I miss his \\"I need to stop what I'm doing right now and dance\\" jams.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is soooooo fun it is also epic I am addicted to this game this game is also a thinking game basically I am saying you should get this .
B008M0UTRO|5.0|(Note:  this is a review of the movie, not of the DVD. Based on other reviews, I would advise potential buyers to be cautious about the quality of the specific DVD being sold.)<br /><br />From Up on Poppy Hill (Kokuriko-zaka Kara) is nothing less than the best Studio Ghibli film since 2004's Howl's Moving Castle, possibly even since 2001's Spirited Away.  Directed by Goro Miyazaki from a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa, From Up on Poppy Hill is based on a 1980 serialized Japanese graphic novel of the same name, illustrated by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsuro Sayama.  The animation is lush and lovingly detailed, and the story an engaging tale of two high school students dealing with first love and with the importance of the past, both on a cultural and institutional level, and, as it turns out, on an intimately personal level as well.<br /><br />The story is set in 1963 in the port town of Yokahama in Japan in 1963 against the backdrop of the country getting ready to host the 1964 Olympic Games.  Umi Matsuzaki is a sixteen-year-old high school girl living with her family and a couple of boarders in a house on top of a hill that overlooks the harbor. Her mother Ryoko, a medical professor, is currently away, studying abroad in the United States. In her mother's absence, Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings, Sora and Riku, and her grandmother, Hana. The boarders, both women, are an artistic college student named Sachiko Hirokouji and a doctor-in-training named Miki Hokuto. Umi's father, we learn, died many years ago when Umi was quite young, killed when his cargo ship hit a mine during the Korean War.  As a kind of ritual to his memory, each morning Umi raises a set of naval signal flags up a flagpole outside the house with the message \\"Safe Voyage\\" to the ships out in the harbor.<br /><br />One day, an anonymous poem about the flags appears in the school newspaper. Curious, Umi decides to visit the school newspaper to ask who wrote the poem. The school paper is published out of an office located in a delapidated old building on the school grounds nick-named \\"the Latin Quarter\\" which houses all of the school clubs and has done so for as long as anyone can remember. But the Latin Quarter is now endangered by a plan to tear it down and replace it with a brand new building as part of Japan's modernization program to put on its best face for the upcoming Olympics, a move that has the students divided between those who want everything to be new and those who have an emotional attachment to the old and traditional, which they see embodied by their beloved Latin Quarter.<br /><br />On the way to visit the paper's office, Umi, accompanied by Sora, witness another student, Shun Kazama, performing a daredevil stunt to get publicity for the paper's \\"Save the Latin Quarter\\" drive. Umi is somewhat less than impressed by Shun's feat, but when she reaches the school paper office, she discovers that Shun, along with his friend Shiro Mizunuma who is the student government president, is the publisher of the school paper (and also, as she learns later, the author of the poem about her flags). Before she knows it, Umi is volunteering to help, first with the paper, preparing stencils, and then soon with their drive to save the Latin Quarter. She suggests that the best way to start would be to give the building a complete facelift, first with a thorough cleaning and then with much needed repairs and a fresh paint job. In this cause, Umi enlists the school's female student population, which in turn gets the male students guickly - and enthusiastically - on board.<br /><br />As they work together, Umi and Shun start feeling a growing attraction to each other. But the path of young love is rarely smooth, and theirs is thrown for a bigger curve than most when Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men, one of whom is her deceased father. But Shun has seen this photograph before, and suddenly a past neither of them were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun. From that point on, the twin plot threads - of Umi and Shun and their pasts and of the students' crusade to save the Latin Quarter - are subtly intertwined. To say more would be to spoil the story.<br /><br />The animation in From Up on Poppy Hill is wonderfully detailed and executed in so many ways it would take a long time to properly describe them. The Latin Quarter clubhouse is a marvel of clutter, completely believable as the sort of old place whose every corner would be filled with incredibly varied bric-a-brac due to the myriad kind of clubs it houses (and going for years without a proper cleaning because that's not typically a high priority with most boys).<br /><br />Another thing I particularly liked were the subtle changes in the backgrounds as evening approached in some scenes; you could feel the sun slowly beginning to set with the ever-so-slight lengthening of shadows and changes in the hue of the sky. Equal detail was given to the way the characters moved and the things they did. In one scene, when Umi is preparing dinner, she pours the rice into a square box, then carefully runs a flat edge over the top to level it so that the amount measured out is exact. It's a minor detail not dwelled upon, but one of many similar ones that give the film a depth of reality rarely found in most animated films.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful animation, engaging characters and truly first-class story-telling that never condescends to its audience.f them were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun.

B00B2166BS|4.0|I was skeptical at first sdamage oogle as yet to get behind the POGO accessories, but this things works perfectly.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-No more risking damage to the use port on my tablet when I try to connect it in the dark. The magnet on the charger finds its way the first time, every time.<br />-Slightly faster charging<br />The Bad:<br />None really. Although,  I wish it increased charging speed was more significant and the cable was a little longer. Data transfer would be nice as well.<br /><br />All in all,  a must have!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Nice colorful dragons, maybe needs a little more content, but fun and engaging. The price for clearing trees is a little high also.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I loved the novel, the cast left something to be desired. I have nothing else to say, but the system required a longer review.
B005R32L66|3.0|i used it on a tablet and on my phone and it worked well in both places.  Also it is free so worth the price!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What an amazing feat, tying all those battles, people, and story arcs together into the grand conclusion. Sanderson has completed with competence what we had little hope of being completed when Jordan passed. I for one, am grateful.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|It's the first series in years that I thought I had to see every episode. I think it's very violent at times, but still, it keeps me on the edge of my seat.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is not my favorite, but it passes the time.  It's nice when you are sick in bed an nd have nothing better to do.
0205313426|4.0|William Strunk's The Elements of Style is an unimposing little volume, but very quickly on opening it weighed heavily as indicator of what I don't know about grammar specifically, and writing generally. I had for a while been consuming books about the craft of writing, referring to top ten lists, and author referrals. Strunk's book is a commonly found recommendation.<br /><br />For me it has not been a quick read, and the more I slashed around in it, the more confused and insecure I became. Buoyed only in those rare finds I was doing it right, even if I couldn't articulate a past participle from an object of the preposition. In full appreciation of this work it must be accepted as a necessary embarrassment, to be a better writer.<br /><br />I think of it this way... I have found to have mechanical skills and understanding of how an automobile works makes you a better driver, usually. I can't explain to you why that's true, but it is. The fact this would seem even more evidently true for writing, on the face of it says it's true. So grab a wrench and deconstruct your writing mechanics. Here's one of the manuals to help you put it back together.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A great insight into problems of company management and inter-group relationship.<br />While reading &#34;The Phoenix Project&#34; I kept seeing people from my past encounters in every character and associating myself with main character.<br />Bottom line, get it, read it, live it!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|All the way through this book I thought  &#34;this seems familiar&#34;. Well i was . I had read it before. The story was so gripping I read it  again and really enjoyed it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not much to say that others haven't already said. Easy to use. Looks great on the kindle fire hd. I definitely recommend.
B00622B3MY|5.0|Cars 2 is terrific and a repeat play request from our three and a half year old! Can't wait for Planes!
B006T5C5PS|4.0|The information in this book is as important now as it was when Dr Gerson developed it! I can appreciate the ideas in this book and have slowly started to shift my diet to include all whole fresh food (although organic is hard to find in my small community) and juices that I have prepared at home. I have seen a noticeable change in my disease processes and in my general health. I am excited to see what the future holds for me after I have made the total shift to a vegetable and fruit diet. Even with the small changes I have made I have seen big strides to better health and well-being.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a really great read, though occasionally predictable. I ejoyed it and would definitely recommend it to my friends.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|One of the best seasons to date by far. The whole family watches it, and we all love it!<br />And there's no bazinga on the end of that.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book really helps you communicate better with your mate. It does not matter whether you are just starting out or been married for years. Any strong relationship comes from good communication
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Read a book by Gillian Flynn. I don't think it was as good as Gone girl, however still brilliant.  Every book she woudl write- i think i would read.
B00AYHKOZU|4.0|Haven't heard alot of but seems to grow on me the more I listen. Reading the lyrics is interesting...bowie's still in space!
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|This book was brilliant. This women's imagination, and the the way in which she planned this story was utterly brilliant. I honestly can not wait for a movie. Gillian has a serious imagination.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I am a diehard Next Generation Fan, and didn't think that this series could capture my imagination the way that series did, but Enterprise has great characters as well.  I may like this series even better than Next Generation.
B007G92QGO|4.0|This book left me with &#34;lots to think about&#34;.... it almost left you to end it with your own thoughts.
030758836X|5.0|This was undoubtedly the most hyped book of 2012.  So I knew that sooner or later I would succumb to its lure. My one sentence reaction: It definitely deserves all the hype.<br /><br />The book starts out, appearing to me, like a fictionalized version of that real life California case.  You know the one with that guy named Peterson who killed his pregnant wife.  At least that is how it was playing out to me.  But Gillian Flynn had more surprises and twists to deal out in her novel.  Was it a bit over the top at times, you bet, but it was definitely a can't-put-it-down read.  It is scary to think that there are people in this world like Scot Peterson but Gillian Flynn gives us some ideas about how a psychopath operates as she lays out the story of the marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne.  I highly recommend this one to all mystery, suspense and thriller lovers.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is another great one from Big Fish Games! I've found that I really like this format, mixing in puzzles with hidden object scenes. The story is easy enough to follow, and if you get stuck the hints are helpful and recharge at a decent speed. The hidden object scenes aren't super easy, but they provide enough detail to make them look more complicated than they are. Certain items must be found as you progress in the story for you to be able to solve the puzzles you encounter along the way, so you stay quite engaged. I haven't finished the game yet, and I've played it every few days for an hour or so. Worth the money if you like this style of game!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've not read many of DB's books so don;t know how this compares with others. If you enjoy mystery, FBI, intrigue stories,  he seems to be an author to follow.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The blu-ray quality along with the 3D experience at my own home made it great! A must have to complete your Tolkien collection
0553801473|1.0|Last night I finished this volume completely and utterly disappointed.<br />With all the hype of the HBO series (which incidentally hobbles along as slow as this narrative), I went through all these books, hoping for something as engaging as LOTR, which I re-read every 4 or 5 years.<br />All the elements were there, and the first three books did a great job of leading up to something great.<br />However, all these last two books do is continue to introduce more and more characters (do I really care who they are - NO.  I'm interested in the Starks, the Lannisters, the Tygarians, and the Baratheons.)<br />GRRM can't seem to find anything interesting for his main characters to do, so he continues to shock us by killing characters with which we've become engaged.<br />Hitchcock did that in Psycho, to great effect, and GRRM does it in the first book.  But then, he does it over and over, until by the end of this, I've learned to not enjoy any character too much because they could be gone soon.<br />And how about some satisfaction for fans to see a hero have a little closure and actually enjoy a moment or two of justice.  No.  We get very little of that.  Only GRRM sitting around with his enormous chess set making all his characters more and more miserable, while the wheels of injustice keep grinding.<br />This does remind me a lot of LOST, where the creators and writers had no idea where they were going.  I get the same sinking feeling here.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Dallas and Melissa Hartwig challenge everything our society believes, and every way of being around food and health that we assume to be natural and normal. By listening to and following their common sense approach to eating and relating to our health and bodies, my world has completely changed. My prayer is that this way of believing will become our country's new normal!
B007FC3AAI|4.0|Not my favorite of the movies, but if you've seen the first 3, you need to finish the story.  Enjoy!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Love the application of the principles in the book. An easy read that I plan to share with family and friends!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case stores your earphone while recharging it for it's next use. If you own a Legend, this is a must have accessory.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am enjoying this game a lot. The graphics are good, and the levels are challenging. Sometimes you have to step away to see it clearly. But that's ok, because the game will save you at that exact spot. No need to lose a life.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Not only are the forecasts accurate, but the simple graphics make reading the forecasts quick and easy. I use this app everyday to schedule my outdoor plans and don't know how I managed without it. I would highly recommend this app!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My oldest son practically begged me to read this book, and I am very glad I did.  My younger son is an academically advanced child, and I found this book to be a very accurate depiction of highly intelligent children and their abilities, as well as their struggles.  I was captivated by the characters, surprised frequently with the way the story unfolded and developed those characters, and was invested enough in the outcome that I will definitely read the sequels.  The story line was also very thought provoking and raised intriguing questions about morality, and if the end result of an action always justifies the method used to get there.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Was blown away by the gorgeous visual effects of this movie.  The story had many deep levels.  We started to watch it with our 7 year old son not knowing if it would be too adult for him.  The tiger growled and lashed out at the boy too much for him as he was scared-due to incredible visuals.  So my husband and I watched it later after our son went to bed.  I may not reccomend it to kids under 9.  Our son loves Star Wars and isn't afraid of Darth Vader.  I supposed the Tiger was too realistic for him.  This is a movie I would own and watch over and over again.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|They made some nice updates to the special effects with the space scenes which is nice.  My boys (11 and 12) both enjoy watching the classic star trek.  The stories are quite good and hold water through nearly 50 years.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie was part of changing our lives and health. If you could truly understand the physical and emotional impact of the food you eat you would change too. I wish everyone would watch.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandburg is an excellent writer, she uses wonderful personal examples to illustrate her points, and she gives all of us practical tips for continuing to guide ourselves, our peers, our daughters to higher levels in corporate America.  I appreciated her viewpoint on how each of us, men, women, young, and old can help empower women in the workplace, and her understanding of various kinds of organizations makes her suggestions seem accessible and achievable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books, the story line was great.  I kept wanting more sometimes I was on the edge of my seat.  I'm sad that I'm done reading the books.  I really hope their will be another one.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This app is THE app for your to do needs. The simplicity is the key. Make a list...add to list...share list...check off list...done. It really doesn't need too much description more than the app store description already has. The company's communication is upbeat and humorous. They offer a &#34;Pro&#34; version but I think that it is for more of a business approach. I showed it to a friend and she's using it as a chore list for her children. Do yourself a favor...get Wunderlist.
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|Santa and the Easter Bunny save ... kids' imaginations? I was not very impressed. I'm giving this movie two stars.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|While the special effects are not as spectacular as today's, the theme and the fact that it is based on truth makes it more terrifying.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This was definitely better than the first book. I got increasingly tired of reading \\"my inner goddess\\" and the repeated use of their last names....it's cute and hot a few times, but man....too much. At least this installment didn't have any bloody tampons.... ack.
B007SSEU9O|4.0|While the story needs a little more meat to fully understand the the character of Margaret Thatcher - Meryl's ability to disappear into the role she plays is why she is a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite books ever! I completely recommend this book to anyone who loves romance and classics as much as I do.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I object to buying pretend credits to play a pretend game.  Really fun concept, but won't spend money on it.
B005COO1X6|4.0|As always Stephen king is an outstanding writer. An interesting story but not what you normally get with SK. I liked it but do be aware that it is but a moment in a story that has unknown beginnings & endings. But it is enough for a good short story'.
B009R659L8|5.0|I've always been a Mary Higgins Clark reader, and once again she didn't disappoint. A must read for mystery lovers!
0062515675|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a good friend. It evoked such a positive energy and helped me rebuild my relationship with my mom. Whilst reading it, one can't help but feel inspired. The true challenge is to employ all that I've learned in this wise fable. It was such a life investment that I purchased 6 more copies for myself and those whom I love, that I know will treasure it as I did.
B003SHZPCK|5.0|I can't help but love this movie, but I'm a Quentine Taratino fan.  Strong female protagonist, great cinematography, and interesting story line makes this movie the best!  Having it on instant only makes it even easier.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a great app, my best friend do it to each other all the time. I would recommend it.
1439192812|5.0|Interesting and artfully presented. With the light of science held on high, Dawkins and McKean reveal the world as if it were a dreamscape of unimaginable beauty.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like the others ... this book allowed me to escape into the story which I look for at the end of a long day.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This purchase I made it because we are two people that love to play ps3. When we have chance we play both
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Very well researched and structured. A must read to have a good understanding of Antiquity, Medevial and Early Renaissance, and the foundations of our Modern thinking.
0307476073|5.0|At the recommendation of a dear friend I picked up a copy of Wild as inspiration for a memoir that I'm working on myself. I didn't expect to get drawn in and so invested in Cheryl and her story. Filled with bits of family background, defining moments throughout her childhood and young adulthood, Cheryl unfolds an emotionally charged cinematic-worthy story onto page after page, leaving me wanting to learn more about her and the people she encounters along her journey. A must read for vagabonds, wanna be nomads, life changers, and those seeking a little inspiration in their everyday.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I chose this book because I saw the previews of the movie. I don't watch movies made from books before I read the book. I want my imagination to do all the work for me instead of Hollywood. However, seeing the actors, I was able to put faces to the characters and really made the process more enjoyable. I recommend this book to all who are against domestic violence, all who love good love stories, and all who wish for happy endings. There is a wonderful twist which I sort of saw coming, but wasn't sure as to when it would be revealed. Don't spoil the book by reading the end.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Of all the books I have read over the past several years, this is without doubt my favorite. I have and will continue to recommend it to friends and family members. Thank you Adam for your sacrifice and your example!
1433502410|4.0|This study Bible is filled with a great deal of useful information but some of the print is so small it is very difficult to read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The free trial game was fun and mentally stimulating.  The upgrade was worth it! I would recommend trying the free android app first before you consider buying to see if you like it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I love this story, it's engaging and I have a hard time putting it down. I do have a little problem with how the telling is constructed, because almost every chapter seems to end with some implied drama that seems to &#34;ask&#34; us to keep reading. The story doesn't need that, it's good on it's own. I'm almost done with it and know that I'm going to start it again as soon as I finish.
B008XBASVY|3.0|I gave 3 stars because it's a good concept but I'm not a fan of the journal style. Nice book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have spider on my android but it doesn't keep score. Being a competitive type person, I love this version.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like the new season with all the new characters, but I love it.<br />Especially since the old characters are still a part of the show.  My kids make fun of me because<br />by the end of the show I am usually very emotional. This show just has it all.
B007SPRQW0|5.0|this book is a must have.  easy to read and helps little ones learn animals and colors.  there's just enough repetition to help retain the information without it being overwhelming.
B008220C56|2.0|This movie was made on the cheap. Just couldn't take to toy train or the prince's yellow hair. The costumes were acceptable as was Keira Knightly and Jude Law.
B004DMIIUU|4.0|While some have given the movie a bad review it seems more that they were expecting more then the movie actually promised, the movie is a CGI action movie with an entertaining storyline but if you're expecting it to be on the dramatic side like Hara-Kiri,Ichi,or The Last Samurai then obviously you're going to be disappointed. Many people I'm sure can tell that this was the same writers and effects creators who did the live action Cashhern movie but I actually found these characters to be more entertaining to watch then the previous mentioned movie.  The CGI seems overabundant and in some scenes unnecessary but it seems the director took to heart some of the Hollywood movies that relied heavily on CGI more then anything else. Also don't expect the CGI to be in the area of say the movie Avatar while it's not horrible it's not going to win any awards either.  The action scenes are pretty incredible and great to watch similar to another movie Shinobi-Heart Under Blade and will remind many of the fight scenes in many anime series like Bleach or Naruto.  The movie released here by Funimation comes subbed and dubbed and I have to say the dubbed cast did an excellent job voicing their characters here but of course if you preferred sub the actors and actresses did a terrific job as well.<br /><br />So if you're a fan action fight movies here's a good one to look at just keep expectations of a thought provoking story off your mind when deciding on this movie.
B0086449YA|5.0|CDs are getting hard to find & my husband is old school, he loves vinyl & cd.  I was happy to find this on cd for him for valentines day!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|I liked that the author chose as the main character an aqueduct engineer.  A person in such a position would be sure to see signs of the coming eruption which increased the suspense of the novel.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This film demonstrates an accurate depiction for all the hard work spent searching for and tracking Osama Ben-Laden's whereabouts. Although a fictionalized drama it appears for be mostly accurate. While, rightly so, The SEALs that raided the compound got most of the publicity, Zero Dark Thirty shows the unrelenting work by a CIA analysis who went against just about everyone else to ultimately pin-point Ben-Laden's hiding place. The movie's last thirty minutes provides a fairly accurate depiction of the raid on the compound. It should be noted that SEALs of SPECIAL WARFARE DEVELOPMENT GROUP TWO were distressed to be identified as the group that carried out the raid.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|This stuff is unbelievable. I put 2 coats (3-4 drops on each finger) on my gloves the first time (as I was told) and it's literally like not having them on when I use my phone and my ipad. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW WITH MY GLOVES ON! BOOM!
B008XG1X18|3.0|It continually force closes since the update. I end up using my phone to look on Pinterest most of the time. Please fix the problem.
B001C1066E|1.0|i did not receive the item in the picture. I was highly disappointed, it didnt close properly, it was a poop quality product over all.
B004JK61K0|4.0|AAA+++ Love the K-9 Mail. It works just fine. It could use easier contacts & calendar. It is great for email.
B0041CGP02|4.0|I love this 2 cd set. It has all the essentials one would ask for. In the liner notes, however, neither of the two bass players are given any credit.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|The DVD quality is fine and it is pretty easy to get to the menu quickly.<br /><br />MacGyver is fun despite being severely out of date. But I was surprised how poorly written the scripts for season one are. There are many fine actors and they give it their best, but it is hard to improve when there are bad lines, scripts, and directing. If I was watching this by myself, I would abandon more episodes and use fast-play on others.
1932735410|4.0|This is a very thorough coverage of the PMBOK guide and exam prep. It challenges you to think , not just read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much fun. the objectives keep it interesting. even my kids like it! you should be able to earn more gems and coins during runs.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I am so happy they made the movie Searching for Sugar Man, cause after seeing the movie I could not believe his music did not make it at that time. Great stuff.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I love this CD it came on time and packaged well, the Cd itself was well put together with amazing artist. I liked it so much that I took out the first one he did from the library.  I had purchaased one for my bestfriedns grandma and she loves it to. She is the one that got me hip to the CD in the first place. A good CD to have in your collection.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|My kind of music, like Donovan and James Taylor. The song  I Think of You is my favorite. It is a beautiful song.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Game of Thrones is a very involved fantasy book with great story-telling.  In places it is very emotional and unexpected.<br /><br />So many characters are developed throughout the book with their own plots with twists and turns, guiding the reader to predict how these characters and events are all going to come together in a final conflict; however, events constantly happen that change the course of history in this fantasy world, leaving the reader to wonder what is going to happen next.  The author does a great job switching from character to character to develop the story.<br /><br />The ending for one of the characters is a little \\"out there\\" for my tastes; and a you are left hanging on the outcome of some characters which, I can only assume, is picked up in Book 2--which I will be downloading onto my Kindle shortly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very addictive! It's like playing SIM city but just building up your whole military town. The only tricking part is being patient waiting on things to built. Sometimes waiting for up to 6 hours.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Great vehicle for networking my business.  Others on LinkedIn have offered me for business.  It is an opportunity to stay connected to professionals we loose track of
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is truly amazing, I love the way the writer wrote this novel in a form of an autobiography. I have grown very fond of Jack Green's books lately. I bought this book several days ago and I couldn't help but finish it, yes, it's that good! I wonder though, what happens to Hazel? does she die out of cancer or what? did the doctors finally find a cure to help her out? and what happens to Peter? does he die out of intoxication or does he finally write a sequel? this book is definitely one of my favorite books yet. If you are looking for a book that contains the story of \\"two star-crossed\\" lovers and their journey through life, then you should definitely give this book a read.<br /><br />PS. I am sorry if I have bad grammar, English is not my first language :)
B001QOGYBI|2.0|I would watch the movie before buying it. It isn't for kids. More for young adults. Pretty funny with weird comedy.
B00746TURW|3.0|Richard Ford writes beautifully. His prose is very descriptive but can at times be slow and ponderous. He describes his characters very well and you feel that you know the person. The downside to this is that the descriptions can be repetitive. The book moves along very slowly and the story gets a little lost because of this.
B001HC8516|5.0|Everything this book says is essentially true.  Actions speak louder than words when you're dealing with anyone, but especially men falling in love or not.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Super app, spot on forecast so far.I've only had it for a week, but so far it has been right on.
B00001OH80|5.0|After reading the reviews on Amazon I thought this would be the worst album ever made by anyone.  I was pleasantly surprised by how genius this album is.  I think people's issue with it is that they are not listening in context.  This was the mid-80s and the reason it &#34;sounds&#34; like an 80s album is because 80s albums were using the state of the art tech available at the time which was not much compared to the next couple decades.  Bowie masterfully creates one of the best albums of the 80s with &#34;Tonight&#34;, IMO.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I love some of the songs, like others and am not thrilled with one. To each his/her own, listen to the samples and buy it if you like it.
0307279189|5.0|I used to run 5-6 miles a day, but work and life seemed to get in the way. Once I became a blob again, I realized that life wasn't as ideal. My big epiphany - exercise. Only problem was that I totally lacked motivation. Weight loss isn't as much of an almighty motivator as it once was. I was a barefoot runner, even before this book came out. I figured, \\"If it's about barefooting, then perhaps it'll strike a match and light a fire under my *ss...\\" Lady, was I right. I've been a running nerd since reading this book. YouTube vids about proper form, articles on Tarahumara diets, etc. Just can't get enough!! In fact, I've already pre-ordered \\"The Cool Impossible\\", which I view as a second installment to the collection. My running books might start looking like your kid's Harry Potter series...
B001458MI2|5.0|I love the energy and beat for doing cardio - walking, treadmill, spinning, lifting weights and just doing work around the house.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome!! I really enjoy it. I definitely would recommend it to everyone looking. Get it for sure.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Wonderful album. Ray LaMontagne's voice is like a loving hug; he draws you in, lets his emotions out and you relax and decompress.
B0015346OM|5.0|Short on opinion, especially the kind of hind-sighted armchair quarterbacking that can often pervade a piece like this. Bowden's delivery is crisp and fast paced, and the view-points of all participants in this little understood military action are well represented
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I originally watched this movie because I admired Richard Armitage, Thorin Oakenshield in the Hobbit film. What a moving, informative movie. All the characters are amazingly  well cast. What a great, great film. I highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These three books were incredible. This finale could not have been written any better.  I will truly miss these characters of Panem.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I was a little apprehensive from reading other reviews but I liked the price and took a chance. I'm glad I did because it has worked well for me. I don't have any other experiences with cases since my Kindle Fire is my first tablet.<br /><br />Overall I really like it.<br /><br />This case is a nice size and doesn't add too much wight gives good protection if I jam my Kindle into my back pack. I like the color although others might find it too bright.<br /><br />The rotation feature is convenient and allows you to prevent the unit from flipping over while using the hand strap. (Other review were concerned about this flapping over but I find if you rotate it it's not a problem.)<br /><br />You can charge the Kindle while it is in this case which is great because I did not want to have to take it out. When closing the case it activates the sleep function which helps conserve battery life.<br /><br />I find it easy to hold like a book or fold the cover back an hold it in place with the band. I like being able to use the strap to hold it closed too. I have large hands and I find the hand strap comfortable on my hands and not too tight.<br /><br />My only peeve is the stand doesn't hold the Kindle at a good viewing angle when placed on a table.(Like to watch a move.)  It's too upright and not angled back enough. There are three positions to do this and none seem to get it right. I don't use it that way often, so it doesn't bother too much but if you were planing to do that it might bother you. Slipping a magazine under the forward edge would probably be enough to get the angle &#34;just right&#34;.
B007XF4J70|5.0|The film was as sharp as if it had been made yesterday.<br />and with the extras provided at the end it was superb.
034580404X|5.0|Book waw well written, had a great story line, and introduced a lot of matterial that was beynod my imagination.  Would higly recommend to my firiends for a good source of reading.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game. Lots to do,and I really like the new wedding stuff.<br />I wonder what they're going to come up with next.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|This was Recieved in a timely manner.  I really enjoyed being able to watch it thru my Amazon Prime account while waiting for it to arrive in the mail.  Also really liked receiving the movie pass to the new G I Joe movie.
B000000XB9|5.0|I turn it up all the way and listen to them on my new tower speakers that I have been cheap<br />to buy over the past years. Nam songs pop right out and history repeats.
034580404X|1.0|I couldnt get past the first three chapters. Maybe sometime later, I will try again.  It just doesnt seem to keep my interest. It is too much fiction for me to really believe.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|So nice to hear the memories of times past that will never be again.<br />I play it often just before bed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app for all your weather needs. I love all the functions the app offers, perfect. AND FREE which makes it even better!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I play mahjongg on many platforms and is pretty and challenging.  Definitely worth the cost.  The game is also positive for teaching about touchscreen technology to the uninitiated while having fun.  I would like more soothing music.  this is a bit blah. /
B00BWJ91XK|1.0|I waited for this?  Not happy.  Disappointed. Let Down.  Some scenes left me wondering why?  Why do that?  Why put that in?  I tried to like it but not the case.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Received just like new. Worked great! My son loves it as much as i did when it first came out
141694737X|5.0|My son just turned two and we love this book. He gets excited to call out the animals when we lift the flaps. Also, it's repetitive nature is really good for pre- readers. He finishes the sentences when we point to the words and can &#34;read&#34; almost the entire book by memory.
B000W178XO|4.0|There are a few songs that I would like to add to this collection. One like 'Ain't no grave' and a few of his hymnal/gospel songs.  I hope to meet him in heaven one day.
B007X70NVO|5.0|Ewan McGregor does a great job of narrating this video about the epic competition that can only be found in MOTOGP.  I am looking forward to more of these.
B00881PTRC|3.0|The animated reactions of the cartoon character are cute but it was surprising that when I finally saved his life, there was no response at all -- it would be so much more fun if he'd give a cheer, or look grateful or at least jump down from the platform. I played long enough to see all the reactions, but there is no motivation to keep going. I'm glad I got this game for free, If I had paid money, I'd expect more than a half hour's entertainment.
B005EVVESM|5.0|love the music,all the song are very good.good singers and they sound great. would tell people to purchase this cd.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|The music stands on its own but when you see the movie and hear the soundtrack it's a perfect combination.  I look forward to what M83 does next!
B00C5ZORES|4.0|another great album from a great band. this album keeps growing on you...the more you listen, the more you love.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In fact, I stopped reading it after I first got the sample. But it remained so popular that I decided to try it again & I'm glad I did. It was great--prose that's really easy to read and a plot that is truly suspenseful. He keeps you guessing all the way & has a real twist at the end. Now I'm reading &#34;Mission Flats,&#34; another book by William Landay.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I thought this was a great movie.  Very funny and I think both guys and gals will enjoy the humor.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|Admittedly, I did not buy this soundtrack for a very long time because I felt it might be redundant to Fellowship of the Ring. How wrong I was! This music is even more beautiful than Fellowship, in my opinion. Several scenes are deeply moving, causing me to recall very emotional scenes from The Two Towers, but the soundtrack does not conjure images from the film with every track--it is enjoyable without having seen the movie, of course. I have, of course, listening to Fellowship countless times in the many years since I bought that first album, and now regret having not bought the two sequels sooner. I find that listening to all three in a large playlist while at work helps pass the time. It is so beautiful and inspiring that it always puts me into a joyful mood, no matter how the day is otherwise going. It can be quite escapist, to be honest.<br /><br />My opinion of the three has changed quite a bit since listening to them all fairly regularly for a while. My first choice is The Two Towers, followed by Fellowship, and thirdly, Return of the King. However, it's quite a toss up between FOTR and ROTK--with the former only edging ahead because of the novelty of the opening scene, and chronologically how I prefer to conclude with ROTK while listening.<br /><br />Rather than going to random play, what I often do is play the first few tracks of Fellowship, the first few of Two Towers, an reserve the last few track of ROTK for the end of the playlist. Now, everything else gets randomly shuffled. The result is a natural beginning and ending, with the majority of each of the three scores combined in the middle. Beautiful!
B000N6U0DS|5.0|I bought one movie for me and another to gift a friend, because this movie has a nice message and history of perseverance.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I'm kinda flustered. This was as well written as the first two in the series. But I felt like it was wrapped up too quickly. Not sure how I feel about that. Maybe a fourth book will be written telling us what happened in their brave new world. Maybe from the standpoint of their children. Hmmm..
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Romantic comedy for you and your woman to watch together and also to get you both in that mood afterwards as well
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is great. It's affordable but well-constructed -- it is solid and seems like it will hold up for some time to come. I've had it for maybe a month now. It's sturdy enough, isn't ostentatious or ugly . . . what more can you ask for? I have slim wrists and it looks fine on me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What can I say beyond the many other reviews.  This is a very engaging book, but I simply didn't like the plot closure.  For the time, and money, spent on this book, I was looking for a more pleasing/appropriate finale.  Alas, I didn't write the book.
0345803507|5.0|This book was really really great.  The first two were OK - but the last one tied everything together.  I originally thought Ana was just a doormat and Christian was a controlling jerk.  But you really see what an amazing husband and father he becomes. Though,  Ana puts up with a lot of his crap in order for him to get to where he is at the end of the third book.  Ana eventually stands up to him and doesn't take his bossiness.  Christian is able to fight his inner demons because of Ana's love and he becomes a changed man.  The 3rd book isn't so much about the raunchy sex- it's a loving, passionate sexual relationship. It's interesting to see as the relationship evolves so does the sex - it becomes more passionate and intimate. Granted they do still do a little of the kinky stuff, but he does love her.<br /><br />Yes, Christian has his control issues along with his many issues in general - and does some stuff to Ana that's a bit disturbing - the orgasm denial (which was pretty awful), when she went topless sunbathing and he left hickies all over her breasts (that was very disturbing) and when she told him she was pregnant and his reaction made me really not like him for a few chapters.  Somehow, he still managed to win me over in the end.  In real-life he would be considered a con-artist and abuser, but in fantasy literature land he was just a complicated character with many inner demons he learns to fight. I sincerely hope teens aren't reading this thinking this is an ideal, real-life romance.  This is not how real relationships work. In real-life Christian would be considered nothing more than a cold, abusive, controlling jerk, unable to deal with anger and jealousy and acts out in violent ways. He is taking full advantage of a young, naive, sexually inexperienced girl and basically brainwashes her. This is the kind of guy your fathers warn you about.  If you want to put it in blunt terms Ana is basically asked to become his sex slave (though this could be disputedbecause she's agreed to do it)...but then she refuses the contract and he falls in love with her.  This is in no way a normal relationship - but it makes it fun to read about.... There needs to be a 4th book!!!!  I will be first in line!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show highly recommend it. Do not start your viewing experience with this seaon need to see 1 and 2 first to fully understand all that is happening. Enjoy.
B000Q1EZ9A|5.0|Grease has to be my favorite 70's movie musical! It has a variety of songs that recreate a 50's high school era and does a damn good job at it! In my opinion the quality and magic of the soundtrack still has it even after all of these years! I always have to dance to the great songs! I will admit that this is the movie that started my obsession for Olivia Newton-John! If you are a fan of Grease I would totally check out this movie soundtrack!<br /><br />Grease is still the word!!
B00B19DW0E|4.0|Sometimes I think the older movies have better written and help the plot along and not so much graphic animation
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book for a book club meeting, and most people attending did not care for the book because they did not like the characters. The author writes well and has an admirable writing craft.  I hope better characters choose her for her next novel.

B000NA28IE|5.0|Everything was fine.  Exactly as stated.  The movie was fine, just not nearly as good as the book!  Great price.
0765365278|5.0|First off, yes, this book is long. There's no way around that, but in a book this good, 1200 pages is a blessing.<br /><br />The story focuses on four protagonists, Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan, and Szeth, though this is primarily Kaladin's story. Sanderson masterfully weaves each of these characters (except Szeth who only gets a few chapters, but he's awesome enough that the little we do know about him is simply tantalizing) and each has some driving purpose. Kaladin to survive, Dalinar to show the world he isn't insane, and Shallan to rob the most powerful woman in the world. Kaladin's flashbacks jump out to show the sheer depth of his character and tragedy of his situation.<br /><br />The setting is weird, with stony landscape, giant crustaceans, plants that withdraw into shells when people get too close, and the deadly highstorms that ravage the land periodically. Roshar is so alien, but Sanderson develops it so perfectly that it makes sense, even going so far as to mention countless scholars, strange scientific inquiries, and a somehow flawed history.<br /><br />And the plot... I could hardly put it down. I bought it last fall and have read it twice because of how everything enthralled me. If you like fantasy, you have to buy this book. If you don't like fantasy, you still have to buy this book. If you don't like reading, you should teach yourself to like it so you can read this book.
B009NNG6CQ|5.0|Although Allen did NOT direct this film version of \\"Play it Again, Sam\\" it is an entirely faithful adaptation of his  stage play, complete with the original cast members ( Allen, Keaton, Lacy and Roberts.)  The only real change  is in the location of the action ( it was changed from New York City to San Francisco to reach a wider audience at the time.)  The viewer should be aware of some dated dialogue ( an always uncomfortable, off-putting moment being a reference to rape.)   However, as with any  older film  it carries with it a certain amount of \\"baggage\\" from it's period of origin.   That said, the film  still delivers laughs, especially for Bogart fans.  Allen and Keaton are perfectly matched , Tony Roberts is always first rate as Allen's best friend, foil and confident and Jerry Lacy was born to play the role of Humphrey Bogart.

I like all the songs.....BRUCE is the voice of METAL and his solo career is the best ever!!!!!!!!! (that's true, and Bruce solo stuff is WAY better than what MAIDEN created by the same time!!!)

B002A9VJ40|3.0|This is like most of Tom Cruise's works that you cannot figure out what the point of this film is. Top gun has probably the then-state-of-art digital effects to describe how fierce pilots' job could be. However, random people (the director obviously wanted them from outside to accentuate Maverick's inner personality more than they did) come and go, making the screenplay quite loose. At the end, you will be like, &#34;well, if it were not for Tom Cruise, God knows how abysmal this could be.&#34;

0374531269|3.0|Ishmael Beah's personal account on the war happening in Sierra Leone was both heart wrenching and eye opening. It's vivid imagery and detail really captivates the hurt, destruction, and total disregard for humanity involved with Beah's experience as a child soldier. Overall, the autobiography is in itself a very accurate and dramatic depiction of what was going on in Sierra Leone. Beah does an excellent job with the description of the war and the country itself, going into detail about the corrupt governments and the wretched and torn up living conditions. The book itself was a pretty fast read, incredibly in-depth and interesting. Interestingly enough, this book relates a lot to globalization in the way that the war affected many countries outside of Sierra Leone. Also, the fact that this is a published book, different people are able to read up on a first hand account of the conditions of the war in Sierra Leone. Through a feminist perspective, it's interesting to bring up issues on sex of the child soldiers as well as the generals who oversee them. Not only that, but it's important to note that it barely touches on home issues of family and mother's of children who are taken away.<br /><br />Though it was not one of my favorite autobiographical accounts of wars and child soldiers, the book itself is fast-paced and Beah does an excellent job in engaging with the audience. I would highly recommend this book for a nice leisure read or those who are learning about wars in Africa. However, I feel as if it a book like this in a globalization class wouldn't fit necessarily in the curriculum, but it is a great reference.

0062059963|4.0|If you haven't read The Selection, the series is set in the not-so-distant future when North America has gone through two more world wars and is now known as Ilea and has a royal family instead of a president. We're not quite sure exactly how all of this came about because America, the heroine, isn't sure herself. No one is really taught history like we're taught history today - and they history that they are taught is very selective. A very dystopian monarchy. Because a monarchy isn't something that most people would be amenable to, the royal family appease the people by marrying a commoner and that commoner is chosen by a process known as 'the selection.' Through a series of fights with her secret boyfriend, America ends up in the selection process and vying for the heart of Prince Maxon.<br /><br />Now we've reached the top 6 contenders and 'the elite' stage of the selection and America is still in the running! Not only does America have feelings for Prince Maxon, which she never expected, but her ex-boyfriend is now a palace guard and isn't going away without a fight. Add to that, there are rebels from both the North and the South attacking the palace for reasons that America is slowly starting to understand. As her feelings for Maxon grow, so do her doubts about her abilities to be the princess and future queen of Ilea. Not only is the selection a competition for Maxon's affection, it's a competition to see who can be the next queen of the country. I mean - can you imagine? I can't imagine being Kate Middleton (sigh...luff her) who endured years of trial by fire with the British royal family, but to be put through an actual competition against other girls? That's absolutely awful.<br /><br />All this internal turmoil is happening while America is still competing against five other girls. Some of the girls are her friends - Marlee is one of her best friends - while others will do anything for the crown and when I say anything, I mean anything. They're forced to work and learn how to be princesses together, while still being pitted against each other. Each girl is there for a specific reason and America knows that the only person keeping her in the selection is Maxon himself. The other girls have connections overseas, strong connections within the country or are simply favorites with the public. Politically, there are many reasons for them to be in the selection but America has nothing to bring to the table except that she's from one of the lower castes. I've left out the caste system too, haven't I? It's pretty much what it sounds like although there are some details that you'll read about in the book that are pretty interesting.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, there's a lot that happens in this book both plot-wise and character-wise. We learn a great deal more about Ilea and its royal family as well as the rebels that seek to overthrow them. America grows right in front of our eyes as she learns more, grows up and is forced to deal with more than most other 16-year-olds her age do. There were a few moments when I was a bit nervous about where things were going, but Cass definitely knew what she was doing from the beginning. There are reasons for everything that happens and a lot is explained in the end, before even more questions are raised. It wasn't the middle novel of the series that I was expecting and I was happily surprised with the events that took place. I'm looking forward to the last in the series, The One, next year!work and learn how to be princesses together, while still being pitted against each other.

B000Y5JFNE|1.0|I just watched Willow the whole way through for the 1st time in about 20+ years. As a child I thought it was a good movie. However rewatching it now as an adult I thought it was a terrible movie. Seriously the only good thing about this film were the old school special effects.
B000WD66BM|4.0|I got this as a gift for my friend.  She loves this type of music and she confirmed that this CD is definitely a great one. :)
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This move is badass! If you like action, this is the movie for you. Especially in Blu-ray, you get the special effects and the sounds. Must have in your movie collection.
B001J1PT82|5.0|Fantastic ! This is a great example of a classics movie. Wonderful color and a great bit of comedy added to the classic story !

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|With the purchase of this product, I am able to open attachments through my HD Kindle Fire instead of using my laptop.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The game is awesome to me. I am a gameloft user, so I understand the game. The game includes animals (savannah, jungle, etc.) and dinosaurs. I love the expansions, decorations, and the social networking sites like Facebook and Gameloft Live. You start out with a sprinbok and lion. It is easy to collect coins and XP on it . Note: you can only get XP from completing quests and feeding animals.
B002FOQXZK|2.0|I love the album, but I was disappointed that the CD case was broken. That really didn't help the online shopping experience.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a lot like a game called Tiny Monsters. You feed dragons. Levels 1-3 are forms of a baby. Levels 4-6  are forms of a juvenile. Levels 7-10 are forms of an adult. I have the limited Motley Dragon. There are a lot of elements such as plant, earth, fire, cold, lightning, water, metal, air, Sun, moon, Olympus, and seasonal. I don't  have the elements metal, air, Sun, moon, Olympus, and seasonal. Idiocy to mention the element rainbow. I don't have that either. It is the best game ever. &lt;3 it.

B005J2UM9S|3.0|I find it really sad when people in a film are called experts only to reveal their immaturity trumps their professionalism, this movie is a good case of that. You have a group of people here that are out to create a new genre of reality TV (the producer in the first shot claimed it was before the whole batch of ghost hunting shows already out there now). It's hinted that, after filming 5 episodes at other locations, they may have a break for their 6th at an actively haunted asylum. For the first... maybe 10-15 minutes, it reminded me of The Last Exorcism, using frank humor and capturing their fraudulent sides as a way of breaking the ice to the viewer (\\"Hey, how about if I pay you a little to lie and say you saw something?\\"). During the one night stay in the asylum, all common sense and rationalizing comes to a halt. Even the logic in the scriptwriting. What caught my interest halfway through that kept me from turning it off was that the asylum itself was messing with the crew. Not strictly limited to BOO moments and shadow figures, there was an element of confusion of time. A night eternal, one could say. With that in mind, it had me wondering how the producers could have found the \\"film\\" to show it, and it's never revealed, nor hinted at. While the ghosts and specters and sounds keep messing with everyone, the building itself pulls complex pranks on everyone in creative ways (though there's a Greek myth of a certain labyrinth they may have taken some tips from).<br />Not the most original, especially with how, after 5 hours into their stay, the crew's sense of logic deteriorates rather quickly, then close to immediately, completely goes away, leaving you with a bunch of college kids who try to sound tough, leave out the brave, cuss each other out on the most sound decisions then go and do the most reckless things without a second thought. Still, this proved to have a nice level of creativity here and there.
B003VANOFY|5.0|ever since I got them I loved them even despite few cons.<br /><br />pros: very comfortable, and really great noise cancellation as well as good wireless range.<br /><br />cons: sometimes the headset disconnects for no reason (while my friend who has the same headset does not get any disconnection issues) it reconnects immediately though<br />also another annoying part is when you set the headset to stereo mode, it does not like flash player on other browsers, I use opera mostly and when I play a flash video I get sound only from one side, but the flash player on Chrome works perfectly.<br /><br />other than that I didn't have any other issues and I'm loving this headset.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When told this was a story about two teens with cancer I thought this would be a real downer of a story and was reluctant to read it. Was I ever wrong! It is an excellent story of two exceptional teens and beautifully written. Excellent vocabulary with very perceptive character development. I highly recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Its an intellectual read.  Good combination of spiritual and scientific information.  Good book for someone that fears<br />death or is groping with their spirituality.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love all these books and am excited for the movie coming out in August. I love these. And I will continue to read them. They are a definitely books you can read again and again
B0085YAGMA|5.0|I only gave this 5 stars because I could not give me.  This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Well worth it.  The American version is not nearly as funny.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater. It is powerful and moving. The actors playing the main characters really shine in their roles.
B002RI9HUM|2.0|My sister read this book and loved it so much she recommended it to me.  I struggled to read the first few chapters but it just didn't grab me. I decided to put it down for a while and read something else and maybe get back to it later.  I picked it up again a few weeks later, started back from the beginning hoping I would be in a better frame of mind, but unfortunately I haven't enjoyed it at all, my mind kept wandering, I was unable to connect to any of the characters and found it to be painfully slow, for instance there's a whole page about what chocolate bars all of the patients liked, who cares!!  Sorry Marian Keyes!  Not for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is really good game and I enjoy it although why is he smiling when he is getting arrested other than that this is a great game and recommended it to you if you do not already have it

B00AHGUCNM|5.0|This is now my family's favorite version.  I'm personally still fond of the Patrick Stewart performance, but there's more accessible humor here.<br /><br />Other than the completely unnecessary death-chase bit, it follows the original quite closely.

B00381A1MU|5.0|Good set of cars! the crate has a bit of metal inside, so the crane can pick it up. It's too bad the other crates in other sets don't have that as well.
B001B6PBBK|4.0|Don't know if it was my mood, or what, my this film gave me lots of laughs.  Somewhat different, somewhat precdictable, but I found the humor very funny.
B008BM9L72|4.0|After all the reviews and suggestions I heard about this book/series I most say I'm a bit disappointed. It was supposed to be so hot and kinky. But in that sense I found the book rather dull.  It was a great drama/adventure with a bit kinky.
B008Q08T54|4.0|This was a chilling movie with several plots that come together.  I felt confused at times with the insider's (oil executive's) money hungry plots. Oh!!!!!!!, what must go on in the Middle East
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a fun movie for our kids aged 5 and 3.  The blue ray is very nice to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice, fun game that doesn't require you to purchase anything. Incentives for coming back every day without risking losing a lot of time if you take a break for a bit.

0385738781|3.0|The trials are finally over and WICKED is ready to come clean by giving the remaining Gladers their memories back.  But Thomas hasn't gone through the Maze and the Scorch only to trust WICKED.  Convinced that answers aren't everything, Thomas and a few others decide to take control of their own lives and start anew; WICKED has other plans.<br /><br />On the story...<br />This was a satisfying end to the series.  There is a bit more world building compared to the other books in the series.  The plot was good and interesting.  We get lots of action, see the return of our favorite characters, and finally get some answers.  The only thing that irritated me about this series was Thomas' decision making.  It was questionable and annoying.  It felt contrived to further a very tired plot point--their lack of a memory of before.  Thomas not wanting his memory back seemed silly.  I felt like it was an excuse to avoid fleshing out the pre-apocalyptic world.  It was a cop-out in my opinion.  We didn't really get to learn how the Gladers were before their time in the Maze or what was going on in their lives.  I also didn't think Thomas was consistent.  I didn't understand why he easily forgave the betrayal of one person but not that of another when it seemed like the same thing to me.  I will say that it was interesting to see a love triangle where a guy was the center of it.  It was hugely different from those written by female writes and it made me laugh because it seemed more realistic but just barely there.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />I continue to appreciate Mr. Deakins narration.  There have been tons of characters over the span of this series and he manages to make each completely distinct.<br /><br />Overall...<br />A good end to the series.  It was such a relief to get some answers and the last shocker at the end was entirely fitting.

0385742886|3.0|In this prequel to The Maze Rumner we finally see how the world went from the world we know in our world to that of the bare, sun blistering land full of insane blood-hungry diseased people.  It follows Mark and Trina as they navigate the world's bizarre occurrences.  The sun flares have already occurred but there are flashback to before this event through Mark's dreams.  I definitely think this one should be read last in this series.<br /><br />On the story...<br />While I wanted to know the background of the problems introduced in The Maze Runner and subsequent books, it would have been more enjoyable if integrated into the other books are made into a--dare I say--novella.  It was hard to get attached to the new characters.  I go to the point where I lost interest in the plot every once in while.  I sometimes zoned out but never really missed anything.  It wasn't a bad installment but it wouldn't have been necessary if Mr. Dashner done better world building in the other books.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />Mr. Deakins continues once again to amaze me with the depth of his talent.  We are introduced to even more characters with very distinct voices.  At no time is there an overlap or confusion.  I'll definitely be looking for this narrator in the future.<br /><br />Overall...<br />I'm always glad to get more answers and I valued the plot and information in this installment.  I just think I would have appreciated it if introduced in the other books instead of a long drawn out book.  As for the series, I still think The Maze Runner was the best of the series.  If I could do it over again, I'd still read the entire series even though I wasn't satisfied with all of the installments.
B00BI5J9BC|3.0|Amazon did a fine job of delivering the video electronically.  Unfortunately, the producers and directors did not meet my expectations.  Frankly, they could have found better singers for the main roles, rather than going with famous actors.
0385738765|2.0|The maze has been solved and the Gladers look forward to some answers.  Little do  they know the maze was just the the beginning.  The Gladers soon wake to frightening news and a discovery that another journey lies ahead.  The Gladers must cross the wasteland, an area known as the scorch because of its burned sections, and lack of protection from the sun flares. But this journey isn't easy and Thomas and the other Gladers can't tell who to trust.  Their lives are threatened at every turn as they run from both WICKED's contraptions and the zombie-like diseased people known as cranks who roam the wasteland looking for blood.<br /><br />On the story...<br />The Scorch Trials was both interesting and frustrating. Just when you think you are making progress and figuring things out, you find it is all a lie.  It is different form the Maze Runner in a disappointing way.  The Maze Runner had a mystery/puzzle with hope and a goal.  Scorch Trials felt like one of those senseless killing movies with lots of blood and gore and no real point.  There were no answers and so much confusion.  Though the the plot was another puzzle, the plot seemed to lack structure and everything seemed random.  There was lots of adventure but not enough to overcome my frustrations over the lack of answers.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />I really like Mr. Deakins.  I think he does a great job with both male and female characters.  If you are completing this series, I think the audio form is as good as any form to read it.<br /><br />Overall...<br />I found this installment frustrating but not enough to quit the series. The Maze Runner really hooked me.

I have returned them and reordered an 8 in hopes they fit like my size 7's do.  Crocs must have changed their sizing in the last few years or the first pair was mis-marked.
1609410416|5.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Ellen. She's awkward, awesome and funny and I kind of like to think we're similar in that respect. When I whip out my Ellen dance moves at the club it keeps the creeps away so I'm probably not entirely delusional!  I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this book. It was very clearly not a memoir, but I couldn't really imagine what goodness it could contain. Turns out it is entirely comprised of random musings that are oh so very funny.<br /><br />I chose to listen to this book versus reading a hard copy mainly because humor can sometimes be missed when you don't read the joke exactly how it was delivered. I have a feeling this book still would have made me laugh had I actually read it, but I laughed so much more listening to Ellen read. This is not a book of substance, but it is guaranteed to at least make you chuckle. If you are feeling down or just need a good laugh, put aside about 3 hours and listen to this book. It makes the rainiest day seem not nearly as gloomy.

B0016OLC5Q|1.0|You can imagine that Sean Penn couldn't be persuaded to cut even a minute form his masterpiece. Every scene being so \\"vital\\". The result is a LONG, tiresome, self indulgent film. Every theme explored is just an exercise in hormonal adolescence, and Sean Penn is sympathetic to all of it. I actually liked Sean Penn before seeing this movie. Thought his live well lived and his acting above par. This movie reveals him to be a moron. No criticism of the ridiculous guiding principles that underline the choices made by its main characters is ever broached. In fact, these principles and the characters who live them, are celebrated. I went into this movie expecting to enjoy the character's striving for independence, his self reliance and tales of survival in the wilds of America's North West. What I got was the story of a privileged young man, making bad choices, losing his mind, and eventually his life. There is nothing enjoyable here other than the scenery.<br /><br />This movie takes itself serious for every one of it 150 minutes. It should not have.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Original story line.. worth the watch, but glad I didn't waste money going to see it in the theater.<br /><br />Jamie Fox and DeCaprio provide solid acting. A little on the cheesy side, but that's what you'd expect.<br /><br />Tarentino needs to quit with his cameo roles.

B00B52F278|5.0|I read the \\"most helpful critical review\\" simply to see what the person saw that rated the series 1 star.  I could not believe anyone was unaware of the historical outcome.  I did not even have the energy to explain the story to the reviewer who wrote the 1 star comments.  Thank goodness, D. Meyer made an eloquent post at the end of her comments that you MUST read!!!!!!!!!  I myself, replied to that post because it said everything I wanted to say.  The series, including the final season and the finale, all rate 5 STARS in my book!!!!!!  Obviously, this epic series is so great that now it has spawned a deluge of other historical type miniseries.  Notice now, we have Vikings, DaVinci's Demons, etc...  Spartacus made all of us realize that history can be made to not only inform us but to entertain as well.  Every single thing presented in the series was not necessarily \\"historically correct\\", nor did it need to be.  The basics were all there and the acting, writing, directing, special effects, etc... were SUPERB!!!!!!  I had never seen a miniseries that I thought matched the scope of ROME which was shown on HBO a few years ago until Spartacus blew in back in 2009!!!!!  This landmark series will stand on its own merit for years to come.  Anyone who had anything to do with its production should be proud of such a magnanimous achievement.  I said the show rated 5 stars in my book---I revise that---it should be a resounding 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00B2DSK06|4.0|A wonderful homage to old and new video games as well as a lot of social interactions from different games and characters from them.
B00BESLT6G|1.0|Story takes a complete 360 degree flip from the first movie. To put it simply who is the good guys and who are the bad guy's. If you ask me the writer was sniffing glue on this one. In the first movie the crazy cult church people were the bad guys, and this one was the little girl. The writer was just trying to drag out a second movie from what was a decent story and botched it all up. I know he was trying to answer questions from the first movie, but sometimes it's better to leave it to the imagination. This movie was boring and drug out, rent it but I wouldn't buy it.

B003UESJHY|5.0|This was an amazing move. I watched it in DVD, Blu-Ray and then the digital copy. Would watch another time if there was a different format to watch it in.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|My wife and I just started watching this show awhile ago.  Over time, we got caught up on the first 2 seasons via Xfinity On-Demand, and purchased season 3 through Amazon Instant video to watch via the XBOX360.<br /><br />  In general we like the premise of the show, and the way it portrays the kinds of situations and decisions that people would likely be confronted with in any type of world-rending apocalypse or collapse of civilization.  The character development is generally excellent, showing people at both their best and their worst.  I think proof of this is that we each have characters we love, and some we don't, for our own differing reasons.<br /><br />  Other shows we have followed seem to struggle after a few seasons to come up with new elements to keep things interesting without straining story arcs that the audience has already accepted, and I can't even imagine how complex all that must get for the people behind the scenes - writers, directors, etc.  I like this show's pace so far, with its succession of new threats/bad-guys, but I could really do without all of the soap-opera-type melodrama.  Being a guy who strives for as drama-free a life as I can get, I'm just not interested in that aspect of the show, and to me those parts of the story drag on, taking up screen time that could have been better used in my opinion - (Come on people... you had to throw in a Maury Povich &#34;Whose Baby Is it?&#34; sub-plot? ...really?).  My only other real complaint is that at times the characters do such completely, unbelievably unrealistic things, it seems like the director tells the actors to do just the opposite of what they would do in that situation in real life.  Those scenes create an occasional disconnect for me that breaks my willful suspension of disbelief.<br />  Those comments aside, we do find ourselves anxious to watch each &#34;Next Episode&#34;.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. Since I took the chance and read Hunger Games I became hooked instantly. So logically as soon as I finished it I began this book. In my opinion this book was even better than the first. I feel this way for the simple reason that there wasn't time wasted on character development. We as the reader learn all about the main characters in the first book so with Catching Fire it jumps right into the action and picks up right were the first left off.<br /><br />Katniss has come home after her stint in the Hunger games and life has completely changed for her. However, the change has not necessarily been for the best. The capitol feels like they have been made to look like fools after the last Hunger Games and Katniss is the one they blame. Her District becomes crowded with new more violent Peacekeepers and the other districts begin to resist the capitol. I will leave it at that for those who have not read the book yet and plan to. I would hate to ruin one second of this amazing story for someone else.<br /><br />The action in this is heart pounding and I was glued to my Kindle/iPhone to read it when ever possible. Knowing the characters from the first book, I seemed to be more emotionally invested with the characters. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading. I had said in my review of Hunger Games that I am not a fan of Young Adult Fiction, but this sure doesn't read that way.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Its fun to play because you can create your own town.<br />But investment points are hard to get. But all in all this<br />game is great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was apprehensive to read this because for the most part I'm not a fan of young adult fiction. After the many great reviews I had gotten from friends, and of course my wife's glowing review, it was time to give it a shot. With those reviews I was warned that it might be a slow starter but I was hooked two chapters in.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the dystopian style novel and figured this couldn't be all bad. I loved the concept, from the beginning I could imagine the anxiety everyone must feel as there children are drafted for the games through a random lottery. Having a son of my own, I know I would be terrified until I knew that his name was not chosen or until he won the games. This made it easy to identify with the characters and share in the emotions of the story.<br /><br />I'm now hooked and can't wait to start the next book. With the movie releasing soon I'm very excited to compare the two. I hope it is good because I am now a fan.
B001NLKS16|4.0|I liked the book. It was in total contrast to the show, but I am kind of disappointed. It didn't have a lot on the creatures that they hunted and most of the illustrations were low grade but that's fine. I did like how he kept up with these events but some did not have any relevance to the reason it was written.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I feel like I just lost my best friend. This book is lengthy and terrifying, and can really wear on a person from time to time with some of the situations that occur in this book. However, King did such an amazing job with this particular story and the way it is told that I feel saddened to say I finished this book. I noticed I had less time to read towards the end of the book. When I did read I would do it in bursts and then leave it be for awhile, I realize now that I was prolonging the end, I desperately wanted to know what happens but at the same time I never wanted this book to end. To truly do this book justice my review would be as long as the book so I will try to keep this to a minimum, but let me say this, read it. If you know King's writing and can look past the language from time to time, and get past some of the situations that at times feel like they could have been left out and the book would have been just fine, this will be an instant favorite.<br /><br />The first thing I want to say about this book is I love the characters. IT is a very long book and a lot of it is spent getting to know the main characters. Normally, this long drawn out set up would drive me nuts and pretty much ruin any chance of the book being more than a three star review. In the case of IT, I connected with every one of these characters in a different way. I loved reading the stories from when they were kids growing up in Derry and how they met Pennywise for the first time, and how they came to know each other. I would be lying if I didn't admit times where it dragged a bit, but every story had something about it that made me want to keep reading, made me constantly wish I could pick up the book again when I couldn't read. These characters had so much depth I fell I know them well, I was in the losers club just as one of them. I even would have looked past my fears to go into the sewers after Pennywise with them if I was a character in this book. That is King's gift, he can write characters that seem like real flesh and blood people.<br /><br />The other thing I want to point out is that if you are itching to be scared this is the book for you. I am not a fan of clowns so the creepy factor was already there but as I read this I was thinking at first, this isn't so bad, not terrifying but goose bump worthy. The more I got into this the more my imagination would take over and make me feel anxious and tinges of fear when the lights were out and I was alone. Trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night in the dark became something my mind would bring a cold sweat to my hands and an accelerated pulse. It might not have been scary at first but give it time, your imagination might win out over reason and logic.<br /><br />Finally, with King I have hit or miss feelings about his details. He can get so long winded that I wonder if I shouldn't skip ahead. Don't get me wrong, I am a hug fan of King but in some of his books I feel like whole sections should have been cut out. That is not the case at all. the details are written in a way that they not only add to the story but help hold your attention so the description of the town, or the interludes at the end of each part, are just as good as the story itself. I could go on for much much longer but I hope I got my point across, I loved this book and it was truly amazing. Of all the King I have read so far, I must say this is my favorite of his. King's Dark Tower series was phenomenal, and my favorite epic story, but IT is my favorite King book so far.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|It was a good prequel to the ones before it. Great story line to set up the next one in the franchise.
1451627289|5.0|I absolutely loved this book; I flew threw it faster than most books I have read and I even tried to take it easy to not miss a single detail. I think the reason I loved this so much is for the sheer fact I didn't really expect to like it. I am not a fan of historical fiction so this is not something I would have chosen. However, it is a Stephen King novel so I had to, I am so glad I did.<br /><br />In 11/22/63 I was afraid it would be a lot of facts about Oswald and Kennedy with some fiction thrown in and I was expecting to be bored from time to time. I couldn't have been more wrong. Following Jake Epping through his adventures in the past and what effects each choice would cause was amazing. Jake is asked by an acquaintance to go back in time and save Kennedy from being assassinated. Reluctantly he agrees, Jake tries to say know and run from the crazy man but is so intrigued he has to see for himself. Jake feels he has to test the waters a bit so he finds his own way to change the course of history (hopefully for good). This is the memoir of his trip to the past and his journey to save the president.<br /><br />Like any Stephen King book the characters were incredibly real. As odd as this might sound, I felt like I knew every single character in the novel and would not have been shocked if Jake Epping asked for my opinion on how to proceed. King draws in his readers with amazing characters and made me feel like I wasn't so much as reading the story, but living it along side his main character. Several reviews I have read had some saying the character development was a little excessive and not necessary, but to me this is what makes a Stephen King book so interesting.<br /><br />For any fan of Stephen King or just a fan of a great story I would tell you this is a must read. For not thinking I would enjoy this much I would have to list this novel as one of my favorites.
B003VW54QO|5.0|This is one of the Duke 's best movies. It has an all star cast. And if you want a song or two from some well known singers of their time, then you will get that too.
0380729407|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and a perfect read for October. Reading this for the second time has made me enjoy this even more the second time around, which is why I changed this from a 4 star review to a 5 star review.<br /><br />This is not a horror novel by today's standards. It is however a fun Halloween read that shows the reader what it is like to be a kid again. During this re-read I kept picturing myself at that age and what I might have done in Will and Jim's shoes. I could see the brown, yellow, and orange leaves blowing down the street as the carnival was opening. This is a very quick read and also a lot of fun.<br /><br />It has some creepy undertones, but Bradbury wrote a story that allowed me to pull memories and feelings of being a kid while my imagination formed each moment of this story. The only things I will say about this book that didn't necessarily bother me but I can see it being slightly annoying is the way it was written, and how naive some of the characters are. Bradbury wrote this in sort of a poetic style. The dialog flows like poems or sometimes Dr. Seuss. I can see that this might not be favorable and normally would have annoyed me as well. But being in the mood for something quick and fun I didn't over analyze it and this just didn't bother me.<br /><br />And about the characters. They are well developed for the time period this was written, but there could have been so much more dept. I almost wished there was a little more interaction with some of the lesser characters because I wanted to know more about them too. These characters were also very trusting and at times naive, in today's world we would be more mindful of Mr. Dark and his efforts to add to his feature show.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|A friend of mine lent me this movie, said &#34; it was an awesome movie & she was right. I've seen it at least 10 times & it still moves me.
0439023513|5.0|When I started this book, and even halfway through I was already thinking this was a 4 star review maybe 4.25 stars. It started out a little slow compared to the others and seemed to simmer for awhile while the events built. After a lot of thought I decided to agree with my wife and give it a 5 star rating because the series as a whole was so incredible, and this being the final chapter the review would encompass The story as a whole. By the time I got to the last few chapters (or at about the 80% mark on my Kindle) I was so engrossed in the plot and the action that this book in my mind deserves full stars for the last few chapters alone.<br /><br />Through most of the book we are following Katniss as she adjusts to life in the underground of District 13. The rebellion is getting started and instead of being a true Soldier on the front lines she is the pretty face now used by District 13. She is followed by camera crews and her face is placed on the Capitol new feed to rally those to the rebel cause. Occasionally Katniss and her team get pulled into the fighting but for the most part it is how she is dealing with the changes and orders of the rebel president.<br /><br />It isn't until the last part of the book that really pulled me back into the story. Katniss is out for blood and is on a mission to kill President Snow of the Capitol and end the revolution. Her and a select few in a team are fighting against the capitol's defenses to reach the President's mansion. This was the most emotionally driven and action packed part of the book. The rest was entertaining but for me the end was thrilling and one I couldn't tear myself away from. For those who have not read the series I would recommend it because of how well the characters and overall story was developed. The second book Catching Fire will still hold steady as my favorite of the Three but each book was amazing on its own in different ways.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game one hundred percent I wish they had more characters to choose from but the game Is awesome and even my friends play it
1401234550|5.0|So I know the world of the DCU has changed and things are basically starting over. In some series I have been less that thrilled, but in this book Geoff Johns shows he is a master story teller and I loved this Volume in the New 52.<br /><br />So I am a little lost about a few things because it has been so long since I have read the Green Lantern series, but I was able to step right into this book and fly along Hal Jordan and Sinestro. This starts off with Hal Jordan being kicked out of the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro (Who was the leader of the Yellow Lanterns) being chosen by a Green Lantern ring to rejoin the Corps he tried to destroy. I must admit I am just as concerned with this turn of events as the character Hal Jordan himself, but when he gives Hal a manufactured ring and asks for his help the story takes off. I will let you read this for yourself, but let me say that out of the few New 52 books I have read, this is one of the best so far. I have always loved reading Geoff Johns stories and this further shows his skills at writing action packed, well thought out stories. For all comic book fans I would ask that you give it a chance and read it. For those who are fans of the DCU or Green Lantern this is a must read.
B00005JPD0|3.0|** Spoilers **<br /><br />Time travel has been done to death, if you are going to do it, you need to put an interesting twist into it. This did not happen as film is so similar to other movies that it comes down to more of the same. I am thinking to myself would it really be a better world if only bad things could be reversed? The other problem is the story itself is not consistent, it is claimed that a person cannot go back in time but yet someone does.<br /><br />To me, there is an added problem that I do not like Denzel Washington as an actor. His holier-than-thou with his superior and self-righteous attitude I find obnoxious. Having said that I think he is a good actor as is Paula Patton.<br /><br />The only character I found really absorbing was the terrorist.  At least, he had something engaging to say although parts of the terrorist speech do not make sense unless you assume he knows something about time travel.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />I would not  see it again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love the game but wish you didn't have to pay for hints. If it came with free hints I would LOVE IT!
0439023491|5.0|I love this book.  It's a bit political, but it kept my attention from beginning to end.  Now my 12 year old son is reading it.
074356619X|5.0|This is a great CD set. It's great while driving on the road which I do a lot . I have enjoyed it immensely.
0439023513|5.0|Great book.  A bit more political than the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but still good all around.  I recommend this book for pre-teens and adults.  The politics may go above some of the pre-teens heads, though.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Good movie would have been better if the language was not so rough and vulgar. Would have rated this much higher.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Motion sickness caused by playing for too long. But awesome otherwise!<br />Use that tutorial and practice makes perfect.<br />Check weekly and daily challenges for extra coins!<br />On droid RAZR
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I refer back to this all the time for publishing my books and I've never had a problem getting my books into the proper format when I refer to this book guide!

B00942Y6WI|5.0|I was surprised, I expected The Help to be chopped up into tiny pieces by the film industry, but it wasn't! The acting was not disappointing, and I'm a huge Emma Stone fan, so that helped. I adored the book and I also adored the movie, there were parts I actually got emotional, which doesn't happen often with movies for me.
0756407915|5.0|The headline says it all. Cannot wait for a third book; one which has a lot of events to cover and loose-ends to tie up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game, it's great for learning how to use your Kindle Fire, too. I'm a lot more nimble with the touchscreen after using this app.
B001N8V7KA|5.0|I caught the movie on AMC and knew I had to get it. I like movies with Clint Eastwood.<br />The real story is over shadowed by the depths that the Jewish people will go for freedom.<br />When he steals the plane, he is about to find out that this machine surpasses any expectations<br />he had.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I was moved by this movie and I was very happy with the ending. The character Denzel Washington plays is one that you want to love and feel bad for, but you also have to remember his vices. It's a fine line between feeling sorry for him at the end and feeling like it worked out for the better. Overall a great movie and wonderful acting, definitely not disappointing!
B009GEDP26|5.0|It is my favorite show.  I like all the characters especially Castle and Beckett.  The humor and banter is great.
B00AVTMB4I|3.0|It's an adorable movie and I didn't really see the ending coming! I thought some of the sub plots could have been a little better, but it was a good movie for a rainy day.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have searched for headphones that don't pop out of my ears when I run and I finally found them! The sound is decent, too. The only negative is that they are a bit large for my petite head.  But at last there is a solution for runners who like to listen to music!
9889979942|5.0|Amazing book by a man who loves to travel and photography ....amazing stuff to do what he did. Great to be able to support him for his efforts....
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Fantastic service & Fantastic singer.  Love the music !!!!  Will be looking for more of her CD's.  She has a terrific voice & terrific songs.
