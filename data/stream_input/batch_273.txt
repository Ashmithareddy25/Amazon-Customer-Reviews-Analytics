B00006JLP4|5.0|I love Disney films, in general, but would not go out of my way to write a review unless the film was beyond superb.  This movie will make you laugh, cry, and bring out emotions that surprise you-- for adults as well as children.  At the outset of the film, the alien nation is a little weird and I was certain, based upon the depiction of Stitch at that point in the movie, that I could NOT come to love him in any way, shape, or form.  Boy, was I wrong.  Disney takes an otherwise grotesque alien and makes him a lovable creature you WANT to own too.  And they take a snotty little girl and give her SUCH human qualities (the scenes with her sister early in the movie are HILARIOUS because they are true-to-form for any 5 year old-- I'm a kindergarten teacher- I know all about it) that you want her to be able to keep Stitch and stay with her (a little misguided and young) sister at the movie's end.  All in all, the movie is a heart-tugger and it WILL touch you even if you don't like warm and fuzzy movies.  <BR>Trust me, this is a movie no home should be without- whether you have kids or not.
B000075BFK|5.0|2pac is still doin it, i just bought the cd, and it is definelly ill. Even if pac is alive or dead, he is the greatest ever to live or ever to live. No contest, def. go and get this cd.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I was a fan of the first Pink album, but I seriously thought she was a one album wonder. Then a friend lent me Missundaztood. More sultry, more mature, and certainly more Pink. From the hoppingly pop &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; to the melancholy blues of &quot;Misery&quot; with Steven Tyler, this chica shows us she's all grown up. Any kid who has been through a parents' divorce can appreciate &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, and even those who haven't (me) can definitely feel the pain the child went through, directly affecting the woman she is today. Her voice is amazing, her message doubly so. Pick it up. You will not regret it.
6302812224|3.0|As scientists traveling the galaxy in search of new civilizations to observe and hopefully interact with, it's been all too rare when those tables are turned on the crew of the Enterprise.  Early on in this series the recurring character of Q was introduced who would return from time to time to attempt to confound Picard and crew.  Here the Enterprise encounters another being not unlike Q who traps the starship in an experimental laboratory.<br />While visiting the Morgana Quadrant on an exploratory mission the Enterprise sensors pickup a void in space.  Upon investigation the null space initially perplexes the crew as they survive an attack by a Romulan starship and witness an inexplicable appearance of their sister ship, the Yamato.  When the Yamato doesn't answer the hails from Enterprise and scans show no life forms present Riker and Worf beam aboard it.  They discover the ship completely empty and that it isn't composed of the metals normally used in a starship construction - and it also has the annoying habit of randomly altering the design.  The away team returns and the Enterprise attempts to leave the void but finds they are mysteriously trapped.  After Dr. Pulaski suggests that they are in a laboratory of sorts an entity appears onscreen, having only eyes and a mouth.  He introduces himself as Nagillum, a scientist who wishes to continue his research on the crew so he can gain an understanding of their emotions and limited life spans.  To prevent the unacceptable loss of a third or more of his crew Picard initiates the auto-destruct sequence and that presents an interesting riddle for Nagillum.<br />The main problem with this episode is that there simply isn't enough time to define the plot elements; the ending seems particularly rushed also.  The reasons for Nagillum's establishing a vast laboratory in space and the apparent super-powers at his command aren't satisfactorily handled.  Data makes many statements such as &quot;Sensors detect nothing,&quot; or &quot;I still cannot detect anything&quot;, etc., but this isn't adequate enough as a potential explanation.  When they first begin experiencing the conundrums no one brings up the possibility of Q's presence; when Nagillum finally makes his presence known explaining his purpose, shouldn't Q naturally come to mind?  Maybe not, but I thought so.  Some other events happen that don't seem to make sense either: When they first encounter the Yamato why don't they attempt to download the ship's logs to read them before boarding?  Nagillum can create replicates of Troi and Data - why doesn't he do the same with Picard and have him abort the auto-destruct sequence with an unsuspecting Riker?  When Picard and Riker initially set the auto-destruct sequence they go to the Engineering section - why?  If they wanted privacy they could've gone into the captain's Ready Room or his quarters.  It seems an odd choice to go to Engineering.  And Haskell's presence at the helm is all too convenient, serving only to remove Wesley from harm's way; also Haskell's dialogue is a bit strained as well, he comes off as being too unstable to be considered for a bridge officer's position.<br />On the upside there is a great opening sequence with Riker and Worf defending themselves against some rather formidable looking alien ogres.  The scene develops nicely convincing you they are on an away mission that has gone horribly awry before revealing they are on the holodeck - an obvious parallel to the encounter with Nagillum.  In addition Worf receives some further interesting character definition here.  Dr. Pulaski is eased along here also, having some interaction with Data and contributing the needed insight and sensibility of a skilled scientist.  Riker's frustration with his experience aboard the Yamato and his anxiety about terminating the auto-destruct sequence adds some levity as well.r &quot;I still cannot detect anything&quot;, etc., but this isn't adequate enough as a potential explanation.

B00005JL2O|3.0|Ok, this one is better then the first Ausin (Man Of Mystery) but not quite as good as Austin 2 (Shagged Me).  Still pretty funny though! If you like Austin buy it, if not... at LEAST rent it, it's definatly worth watching! They left it open for another, I hope it gets filmed!  The trailer had some scenes that weren't in the movie, weird!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|In my opinion, the best album Priest ever made.  Definitely one of the top 10 80's metal albums.
0316666343|1.0|This book left me totally cold. It's hard to feel sad about a girl's death when she is the narrator AFTER it.  She seemed very alive and not really suffering too much.  Especially with the assertion that in heaven you have only to wish for something to make it happen.  The story of her murder is equally proposterous.  It seems impossible for the murderer to have done everything that he did and never be seen by anyone especially given the location of the crime scene.  Her parents reactions seem forced as if the writer had a list of the steps that a grieving family goes thru and went down it one by one checking off emotions.  The ending left me completely unsatisfied.  It was totally contrived and obviously constructed to tie up any loose ends without thought to wether or not it made sense.
6304884419|5.0|This film is amazing. A remarkable story is revealed and stellar performances abound. Palminteri and De Niro, as is often typical of these great actors, offer impressive performances. However, the real stars of this film are Capra and Brancatto. <BR>The intense plot of this film makes it quite difficult to remove <BR>yourself from the television. One drama leads to another and you<BR>soon realize that nearly two hours have passed. Even more interesting, however, is the authenticity of the film. Depictions seem almost too real. This film romanticizes life in the Bronx during the 1960's. It's likely that you will end up desirous of living in that place and time. I know that I did. The soundtrack,<BR>meanwhile, only accentuates an already wonderful film that is representative of the Italian-American experience in New York. A<BR>must see film that words cannot even describe!
B000002MJC|5.0|A loud screeching wail, is the sound that greets this first time listener of the newest product from Depeche Mode. The sound soon morphs into a hard edge blues lick of Martin Gores guitar then followed by soulful scream of Dave Gahan. I feel you is the first track from the album Songs of Faith and Devotion, the bands first recording in 3 years. Unlike the previous depeche release, 1990s Violator, the boys from Basildon have taken on not only a rougher look but also a distinctly rougher sound. Singer Dave Gahan, who only a short time ago had the look of a Mormon missionary to the masses, now looks as though he could somehow be Keith Richardss soul brother. Covered in tattoos and shedding any of the former self, Gahans vocals seem more empowered than ever. The music on the album is a smooth blend of Rock and Synth styles. Almost impossible to describe as a whole, so lets go by track to track.<br />1) I feel You: A blistering rock/synth track that has an almost annoyingly catchy riff to it. Driven by a deep throbbing bass line and a messiah like choir that backs the chorus. 4/5 stars on this track.<BR>2) Walking In My Shoes: This track sounds more like a Sunday confessional than a pop track. The message is simple. Judge not yest ye be judged Filed with a very haunting guitar at the songs extro. 5/5 stars.<BR>3) Condemnation: This song kind of bugs me, Its a bit too far removed from the Mode I know, its almost trying too hard to show a different side of this band. 2/5<BR>4) Mercy In You: Quite possibly my favorite Depeche Mode track of all time. It is quite simply beautiful. The chord progression and effects used on the chorus to this song rival any I have heard in a very long time. 5+/5 stars.<BR>5) Judas: And what would a Depeche Mode album be, if there were not pre-requisite Martin Gore sung ballad. (And there are 2 on this LP). Although Im admittedly not a huge martin gore love song fan, this track is a very good cut. A dark plea for love,moved by a synth-bass and bagpipes. 4/5 Stars<BR>6) In Your Room: A powerful track, not too unlike Stripped. A slow builds to crescendo, imploring Will you let the fire die down soon? / Will I always be here? The sex appeal of this song might not be measurable on modern scientific equipment. 4/5<BR>7) Get Right with Me: This song seem somehow unfinished. Another track that you would not be surprised to hear sung at a southern religious revival. Friends, if youve lost your way / You will find it again someday Amen 3/5 Stars<BR>8) Rush: After a small relaxing interlude in between these songs, Rush comes at you full force. Hard, fast and more than likely a very good single contender. 5/5 Stars<BR>9) One Caress: The second of two Martin Gore ballads, only prepare yourselves kids, there are no Synths in this song! Only Martin and a string section. Not sure if the lyrics are describing a religious ritual, or a sexual act. Knowing Martin Gore, probably both. 3/5<BR>10) Higher Love: A perfect exit for this album. A song that seems to take the listener to a higher place to look back at the journey the album takes one on. Heaven bound by the wings of love / there is so much that you can rise above another superior track. 5/5 Stars.<br />So all in all an album that lives up to the high water mark the band created with Violator. And still it has its own feel that makes it almost seems as though from an entirely different band
B000000W5L|5.0|This is simply the best rock and roll album of all times. Period.
B00007BHOE|3.0|The dvd itself (that is, features and production) is quite good.  However, if this is a typical Slipknot concert, it is a little disappointing.  Slipknot is a heavy band, and like most bands of the genre, they play much louder in concert than is necessary.  The result is a very noisy sound- the songs start to sound the same after awhile.  Also typical of the bands of this genre is the completely lame and unimaginative in-between song banter by the singer.  Corey Taylor throws the obligatory \\"F-word\\" into everything he says.  Such as \\"this is from our new f*cking album\\" and \\"this song is called f*cking __________.\\" C'mon Corey, come up with something more original than that.  Don't get me wrong- I really like this band.  But they are much better on album than live.  The most irritating thing about this disc is the 6-minute plus intro of white noise that you must sit through to get to the performance.  You must sit through it- it cannot be skipped.  If you must have this disc, buy a used copy or rent it somewhere.  It's not worth paying full price for.
B000071JTQ|5.0|Simply Incredible from begining to end. I've been into LC since the 1st EP and this new 1 is amazing. Similar in sound/production to Unleashed Memories but the songwriting has taken a massive leap. The depth of the lyrics is matched by the music; LC is completely at one. I would go as far as to say that this is thier pinacle studio performance. It might take a few listens to fully absorb this sonic masterpiece. The highlight (IMHO) is \\"Unspoken\\". The 2 bonus songs are a very cool track from the Unleashed sessions is called \\"Lost Lullaby\\" (only available w/the limited digi-pak) and \\"the Making of Comalies\\" video documentary which is ok (viewable for PC or MAC). Also w/the digi is a very cool pin (LC/comalies logo, custom shaped) and a large mini-poster poster of the ever-so-lovely Cristina.<br />For female fronted bands that are extremely well done, I also recommend in no particular order...<br />the Gathering, Flowing Tears, the Dreamside, Chasing the Ghost, Theatre of Tragedy (TOT), the Shroud, Rhea's Obsession, Rose Chronicles (Kristy Thirsk from Delerium) Love Spirals Downwards (LSD), Love is Colder than Death (LCD), Nightwish, Lullachry, Aghora (extreme progressive fusion), Angelfish (pre-Garbage goth S. Manson), Sinergy (progessive metal), Chastain (progessive metal), Drain s.t.h. (similar to Alice in Chains).<br />Hope this helps! :)
0345441184|5.0|Mythical King Arthur tales from a woman's magical perspective. Absolutely fabulous and well-written.
B000002H97|4.0|After the sucess of Master Of Puppets. Metallica wanted to do something else. Instead of doing another trash metal album, they wen´t to hire Bob Rock and make their selftitled 5th album. The album often known as \\"The Black Album\\" released in 1991 became an instant smash with record buyers all over the world and made Metallica one of the biggest acts in Hard Rock. The production and the quality of this album is of course at it´s highest. They spend a lot of money and hard work making it and you could just see by the cover and art work that they did. The first track and their biggest hit Enter Sandman is one of the most catciest and one of the best rock singels in history of the music industry ( i do not care what everybody else say). It is an instant classic. However some songs on this album are not as great. There´s some filler and often their key element to sucess was hard cutting edge songs with a great guitar solos and boldness . But on the Black Album they wen´t to sensitive and made maybe a too soft album. Bob Rock who has worked with such terrible bands such as Montley Crue ( not trying to offent any fans) managed to give the album great tone however nothing like Montley Crue. There are some many memorable tracks on this album but though this album has qualities and skills and some fantastic tunes it is hard to miss the fillers and the blanc spots. <br />But I´ll give this album 4 stars out of 5 cause they worked so hard for an album that is good.
B000002KAT|4.0|This requires listening to as its not one of Van the Man's most melodious albums. Definitely of its time, it's not the place to start with Van (get either of his greatest collections), but if you're searching for more Morrison music this is definitely a must buy.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Even though most of these selections can be individually enjoyed on their various source CDs, assembling them all in one convenient package is a Christmas valentine to anyone who has thrilled to Streisand's music over the years.  The new songs are expectedly terrific--she still sounds miraculous at 60--and the rare gems are a treat.  The Kim Carnes duet from the Emotion LP deserved airplay back in 1984 and certainly has withstood the test of time as one of the unexpected high points of this collection.  While some of the standards are more like aural wallpaper at this point (Guilty again?), the Kristofferson and Garland pieces more than fulfill.  Overall, a wonderful CD to hold you until her next album of completely new work arrives.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This is NOT an \\"entertaining\\" movie. It is an ode to Hitler and his power. But for those who want a PICTURE of those times to fill in where a book cannot go, this is the best there is. It is also a profound work on the merits (certainly NOT on the subject). By the way, I was just a little young for the war, but remember Pearl Harbor to the end very well. I went to college with GI billers and spent hundreds of hours having a few beers and hearing their stories. I have a library of around a thousand books on the war, including one of the largest on the Holocaust (many of survivors were friends). I say this as I'm NOT a \\"reviewer\\", but someone who has devoted almost sixty years to the study of 20th Century history. I had ample chances to personally know many of the participants and victims, from all fronts as well as the camps. I retired as a professor, and have a book almost completed. However, because of the openness of many people whose families don't even know their stories, it will not be published until the last of them dies (as I promised when they spoke freely in the short period at the war's end and just after it)...
B000003TAR|4.0|After the big sucess of Nevermind. Nirvana headed back to the studio for their third album. released september 1993 &quot;In Utero&quot; became one of the most critically aclaimed and best selling LP of the year and no wonder. This album is both provocative, deep, simple, raw yet energetic all at the same time. The focus point of this album does not lay in the production ( if you could call it that) but the music and how they perform the songs. They´re angry, they´re tired, they´re strong, they´re weak. the lyrics often strange and mysterious help us to get in the mood while listening to a hard rocking drumbeats of Dave Grohl or brilliant bass playing by Krist Novoselic or the raw essence of Kurt´s voice and heavy guitar. The album comes in mind as a powerful message. <br />A follow-up to nevermind they decided to go back to their routs but unlike their first album Bleach. the songwriting and musicianship is a lot better.<br />If you don´t have this album buy it now because no music fan cannot be without this.
079070546X|5.0|We LOVE this movie.  It is a classic.  There are so many great lines and scenes.  We howl when the turkey falls apart and we quote the tylenol question often.  &quot;Don't fall in love with it&quot; and &quot;it's a bit nipply&quot;  We watch this movie every Christmas eve after Santa arrives.
B00003CXN4|4.0|It was almost too strong for me. The truth can be very, very unpleasant and this movie is filled with plenty of truth. I kind of wish someone will turn it into a musical where the happy druggie kids rise up and teach the fascist DEA agents to relax and be happy. Ah, it will never happen, but we can dream. Isn't that what the cinema is all about?
B00005OAIE|4.0|I am usually pretty turned off when some little upstart attempts to imitate a band/person I love. Now, I happen to be a huge DMB fan and have been for a good number of years now. And since everyone compares John Mayer to Dave, you'd think I wouldn't like the guy at all. But I do. Because, really, they're not similar at all. If John Mayer happens to sound somewhat like Dave Matthews, that doesn't mean he's trying to rip him off--maybe he just sings like that! And the music styles are totally dissimilar. There's nothing quite like DMB's music, and John Mayer certainly isn't trying to imitate it. This is more up-tempo rock--acoustic guitar and voice driven (no strings, no sax) that has more in common with David Gray than Dave Matthews.<br />I am NOT a big fan of repetitive teeny-bopper radio-friendly stuff, either, and I don't think this album falls into that category. I like the lyrics, maybe because at 23 I can relate (a quarter-life crisis? Why yes!). I once spent a whole week searching for the lunch box I had when I was little (83). I have carried on distance romances where it seems all you're doing is taking pictures of things instead of seeing them yourself (3 x 5). I've been desperate to have a Christmas-Valentine's Day love (St. Patrick's Day). No Such Thing drew me to the album in the first place, because I too have dreams of going to my 10 year reunion a bigger success than all those &quot;popular&quot; kids.<br />Maybe I'm a square, too. But for all the flak this guy is catching, I think his lyrics are a good deal better than most of the stuff on the radio now. And at least his songs sound different from one another. Yeah, he's not Dave Matthews (who is ten years older, and ten years is a lot in the songwriting material department). But he's not bad. Anyone in their mid-twenties is sure to at least understand the songs. I really happen to like them.
B00003CY0U|1.0|Why was this movie ever made? Good question. I don't know. Swordfish is a pile.
B000003GBN|5.0|Fritz Reiner is frequently associated with composers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Strauss and Wagner.  In spite of this association, his performances of Beethoven's music are not to be ignored.  Reiner was a stupendous interpretor of Beethoven and any listener of this CD will quickly understand why.  The first movement of the 5th Symphony sets the pace for the entire performance.  These are strait-forward interpretations but in no way does this subtract from their virtue.  The playing and the precision of the orchestra is amazingly clean and disciplined (even by Reiner's standards if one can believe such a thing).  In typical fashion, Reiner rules with a rod of iron and never lets the sound get carried away or even remotely perverse.  In both symphonies and both overtures Reiner favors fast tempi and this is without a doubt very advantagous.  The music is always moving and does not drag the way so many modern recordings of these works do.  One of the most important aspects that these recordings have to offer is the fact that Reiner gives all of the movements in both symphonies equal attention to detail.  He does not let the first and fourth movements completely dominate the second and third movements.  In essence, he does not focus all of his energy on the powerful movements and let the minor ones flutter.  For anybody who prefers very potent interpretations of Beethoven this is it.
B00003OSTN|5.0|Joan Crawford had just left MGM for Warner Brothers and was determined to make a big hit for her new studio.  Michael Curtiz, who some three years earlier directed the studio's magnificent masterpiece, \\"Casablanca\\", was selected to join forces with the brunette star and the result was dynamite, as Crawford marched to a Best Actress Academy Award in \\"Mildred Pierce.\\"<br />The film was an adaptation by screenwriter Ronald McDougal of the James M. Cain novel, which marked one of three successive adaptive triumphs from one of his best sellers, glittering successes for three major female acting greats.  While \\"Mildred Pierce\\" was a soaring 1945 triumph for Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck had recently scaled the heights in \\"Double Indemnity\\" in 1944 and Lana Turner would receive her greatest plaudits for \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" in 1946.<br />Crawford plays devoted mother Mildred Pierce, who is determined above all else to provide daughter Ann Blyth with all of the things she had been denied.  She begins by making pies for neighbors for extra money and struggles as a waitress in a busy downtown Los Angeles restaurant, but soon she scores a breakthrough and starts her own eaterie, which soon develops into a successful chain.<br />The film begins with Crawford being interrogated after her disloyal husband, Zachary Scott, has been murdered at her beach house.  A flashback brings the story into the present, revealing the interesting array of characters who inhabit Mildred's life.  Bruce Bennett is sincere but luckless, having failed in the real estate business, after which the couple separates.  The daugher Bennett reveals as his favorite dies tragically of pneumonia, leaving only the spoiled Veda, played by Ann Blyth, concerning whom he warns Crawford, who fails to pay proper heed.  Crawford is forever and unsuccessfully pursued romantically by wise cracking and unethical Jack Carson, who makes a deal for her to obtain some property from Southern California socialite Zachary Scott on which she can start her first restaurant.  Eventually she will become romantically involved with Scott and ultimately marries him to satisfy Blyth, a social climber impressed with Scott's pedigree.<br />Supplying wisecracking comments throughout is the inimitable Eve Arden, who serves as Crawford's Woman Friday in her restaurant operation.  It is Arden who delivers the brilliant script's premiere line when she tartly asserts, \\"Veda (Blyth) is living proof that alligators have the right idea.  They eat their young.\\"<br />Eventually the L.A. police solve the murder after many twists and turns of the complex series of relationships are exposed.  The film succeeds brilliantly into taking viewers inside the intricate world of a whole constellation of uniquely fascinating characters.  Audience members cannot help but feel that they know them much better than one could imagine over such a brief period of time, the result of strong plotting by Cain in his novel and excellent character revealing dialogue by McDougal.  The action moves throughout at a brisk pace, reflective of the brilliant Hungarian director Michael Curtiz.

0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton has the rare intellect and ability to synthesize the most daunting scientific postulates and theories into a language that is easy to grasp for those for whom microscopic technology is an endless enigma. His new novel \\"Prey\\"is a frightening, horrific venture into the potentially destructive manifestations when molecular engineering detours off a contolled course. The main protagonist, Jack Forman has been laid off from a prestigous programming position in Silicon Valley and has been relegated toa \\"Mr Mom\\" role while his wife, Julia is vice president of a corporation involed in the manufacturing and harvesting of molecular particles which could revolutionize architectural structures and even delicate medical procedures with more innovative instruments. Problems arise when particles amalgamate into swarms and develop the capacity to become not only self sustaining and predatory. Jack has the ability to halt the scourge of these rabid, destructive particles before the repercussions are epidemic and disastrous for humanity on the whole. \\"Prey\\" is riveting in its impact and a cautionary tale which if not heeded ould lead to a holocaust generated by mans tampering with microscopic components that they do not understand fully. \\"Prey\\" really dramatizes the Walt Kelly quotation from Pogo \\"We have met the enemy and they is us\\" For in this novel, man has definitely sown the seed for its unintentional obliteration.
0930073207|5.0|Henry Hazlitt is best known for this brilliant work, one of the most concise and persuasive defenses of the free market ever written.  One reason why socialism and statism appeal to the common man is that government actions are immediate and dramatic: they give the impression that something is being done about a specific problem or crisis.  To show that government intervention in the economy isn't wise, one must \\"look not merely at the immediate but at the longer effect of any act or policy; one must trace the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"<br />Hazlitt proceeds to apply the above lesson to numerous government actions.  By drawing the reader's attention to the unseen effects, the failure of socialism is exposed.  Take for example government \\"jobs programs.\\"  If the government employs 500 people, one might think that government has \\"created\\" 500 jobs.  However, government had to tax its citizens to fund these jobs.  Had the money been left in the hands of taxpayers, their spending would have resulted in an equivalent number of employed individuals.  Government didn't \\"create\\" jobs - it merely destroyed jobs in the private sector.  On issue after issue, Hazlitt demonstrates that government intervention in the economy fails to achieve its stated goals (although its real goal - an increase in government power - is always achieved).  In addition, many basic economic falicies are refuted, such as \\"machines destroy jobs,\\" and workers need \\"to earn enough money to buy back the products.\\"<br />If you are new to the study of economics, don't stop here.  Be sure to read Rothbard's \\"Man, Economy and State\\"; Von Mises' \\"Human Action\\"; and Reisman's \\"Capitalism.\\"  They are the twentieth century's \\"big three\\" works in economics.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this CD shortly after it was released; it was very cheap, and after I listened to it in the store several times, I took it home.  Ever since then, I have listened to it a myriad of times.  Yet, I never tire of hearing her voice with her simple, yet elegant piano playing in the background.<br />Since her quiet release a while ago, she has steadily grown in popularity; she played on The Tonight Show and recently on a tribute to Elvis.  In an interview, when someone asked her why she has so many fans, she replied, \\"I think my music appeals to people because of its simplicity.\\" (paraphrased)  I agree.<br />Although you cannot hear every song or even a whole song by listening to Amazon's excerpts, it does give you a preview of her sultry voice and jazz influences.  This CD filled a void for me.  She is unlike many contemporary artists; it is difficult to foist her into a genre.  She does not try to emulate current great and not so great jazz or rock singers.<br />In a review of her music in a magazine, the reviewer critized her lack of variance in her songs.  The reviewer sugested that she should have added more \\"upbeat\\" melodies.  Yet, what I like about this CD is its consistant elegance and beautiful simplicity with her voice providing debth and wisdom beyond her age.  This is a standout CD because she attempts to remain true to herself.  She is now recognized not because of her marketing team (and style coordinator), but because of simplicity: simple talent.<br />I rarely would give a CD five stars, but this is at least a 4.7.  I hope you enjoy her music as much as I do.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I think the review entitled &quot;A Musical Journey of Hope and Contemplation&quot; pretty much sums up everything I want to say about the album...although I would like to add a few notes about &quot;St. Patrick's Day.&quot; I find that to be a gentle, tender love song, and it's definitely worth a few [hundred] listens.<BR> A few more notes....<BR> Mayer live is CRAZY. His guitar work is INSANE, and his band is incredible. If you miss his live show, you have missed something absolutely extraordinary...<BR> Also: a reviewer posted something about the little homage at the end of &quot;City Love.&quot; I noticed it, too--Mayer is BIG on homages. He often slips little bits of songs he loves into his own work...I'm still searching for other little homages on the &quot;Room for Squares&quot; album, but so far I've only found that one. <BR> I found a mini-homage during &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland,&quot; because you can hear John in the background singing, &quot;I'm never speaking up again&quot; right before the line where he says &quot;...baby, you frustrate me.&quot; That is, of course, a reference to the track directly before &quot;Wonderland,&quot; entitled &quot;My Stupid Mouth.&quot; <BR> I think stuff like that is cute, and it adds a personal touch to the album. But before I sign off: BUY TICKETS TO HIS SHOW. He's a no-holds-barred live performer at heart, and I'm telling you, his musical heart is awfully big.
0071373586|5.0|As a psychologist, I like the authors' subtitle. The concept of &quot;Positioning&quot; applies to this book itself, too -- there are a lot of competing books about advertising today. But the sophisticated marketing approach in this book makes it a true stand out. My advice: Don't miss it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite cd in my collection now.  It has such a varied sound.  You can tell it is Cornell and you can tell it is the Rage.. band.  But boy they go good together.  And not all the songs are screaming in your face, they have a lot of really nice songs, and of course still jam like you wouldn't beleive in others.  My advice is to buy it!!<BR>I was excited when I heard this band was forming, and more excited when the demos where released on the net, and was not let down when the real thing hit the stores!!
B00006JSGQ|5.0|This is another great CD from MK.  It has some excellent cuts.  You might check out Amazon UK for this album for a pleasant surprise.
B000075BFK|4.0|Six years and counting after the death of rapper Tupac Shakur, \\"Better Days\\", the new double CD from a joint collaboration between Pac's own Amaru Records and Suge Knights' Tha Row(formerly Death Row Records)has hit the streets. This is 2Pac's third double CD released since his death in early 1996. Both discs are laced with tracks that reflect the incredible loss the hip-hop community encountered that year. Disc 1, after an eerie 'Intro' that begs the question, \\"Where are these songs coming from?\\", rushes out of the gate with the stunner 'Still Ballin', featuring Trick Daddy. Songs such as this really raise the question, Why wasn't this track released earlier? It along with several other tracks, are simply too impressive to have been placed on a shelf for this long. That being said, just as many tracks here fall short of the mark. And multiple tracks here are simply re-mixed versions of previously released material. The highlight of Disc 2, is clearly 'My Block' a brutal song about the day to day violence of the streets, accompanied by the haunting chorus of children singing, \\"Every block is kinda mean. But, on our block we still play\\". Few rappers of Shakurs' day or now resonate with such honesty and heartfelt reality. Anyone who has followed the music 2Pac has made over the years will not be dissapointed with this release. He will be back...
6301442962|5.0|The original &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is a splendid holiday classic that has audiences stunned. Lawyer John Payne works on a case to prove to everyone that Macy's Department Store Santa (Edmund Gwynn) is the one and only Santa Claus. This case reshapes the lives of Macy's employee Maureen O'Hara and daughter Natalie Wood. It is a truly magical and inspiring Christmas film that never ages which is perfect for future generations. MERRY CHRISTMAS!
B00000JQFM|5.0|Yes, it is. I'm a musician and of course, a music lover. This CD involved me in the guitar world, when I listened to Satch Boogie 8 years ago, I just knew that I had to take a guitar and started to play like him. Now, I don't play as good but after listening to many instrumental CDs I know this is the essential one, this is the best guitar instrumental album of all times, because each song has something inside, and is definetly memorable. <br />The 2nd place is for Passion & Warfare of Steve Vai. If you love electric guitar please do yourself a favor and buy this one (buy it not burn it, this is one of those albums you have to keep original), even if you are not a fan of electric guitar but you LOVE music take it. ...
630289915X|5.0|Why not? It is ranked #11 on the American Film Institue's 100 Best Movies of All Time list. This is Frank Capra's prime and best direction. It should have won all the Academy Awards it<BR>was nominated for. George Bailey (James Stewart) is just a ordinary small town man who when he was a child he had dreams of being famous and building things and travel around the world. Through life's events he never sets foot outside of Bedford Falls. On Christmas Eve, c. 1945, he becomes depressed that he fears he has misplaced $8000 to pay off a defecit. The meanest man in town, Henry F. Potter who tried to ruin George all his life, won't help him at all. George came crawling to the wrong person. George makes an attempt at suicide, but is saved thanks to his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody A-S-2 (angel second class). He shows George who wishes he had never been born at all, what life and the town would be without him. Things are different in multiple ways. It drives George crazy, until he can't take it any longer and asks for his life back. It almost brings a tear to your eye when George is sobbing on the bridge and says \\"Please, God, let me live again.\\" Bert the cop finds him and George he realizes Bert knows him, his mouth is bleeding and finds everything the way it was before, and realizes how happy he was and how many lives he touched and just about everything wouldn't be the same without him. He really did have a wonderful life! His wife and childhood friend, Mary (Donna Reed) arranges all of George's friends, quite a whole lot, to help George out. Indeed, it is true that no man is a failure who has friends. When you see this astounding, inspiring and highly admired film, you'll realize that everyone in this world has a purpose in life and matters to everyone whether they realize it or not. MERRY CHRISTMAS!
B00000JR2A|5.0|I don't care what the critics say, The Seeds Of Love is their best album ever! Nothing like the New Wave influences of their debut, or the synthesized production of The Big Chair, The Seeds Of Love finds TFF shedding their electronic synth pop sound, in favor of an earthier, more soul-rock sound and it couldn't have been better. The cover art perfectly demonstrates the creativity put into the music. 1989 was such a great year for music and this CD topped out the year and the 80s. Sure the next two albums they made were very good but they haven't impressed me as much as this one did. Everyone must have this CD. The bonus tracks are great too especially Always In The Past &amp; the jazz instrumental Music For Tables.
0060523794|5.0|I am shocked at some of the bad reviews of this book I have read on Amazon.  As an Ex-CEO, business owner and involved in the computer industry for the last 20 years, I found this book brilliant, exciting and a must read for anyone thinking of or currently running a business.<br />Gerstner gives a frank look at the challenges he faced and how he dealt with them.  He is open about discussing his inner feelings, desires and wishes for the turn around of IBM..<br />If I had a chance to met Mr. Gerstner, I would give him a hardy Here Here and thank him warmly for writing this book..
B00005YW4H|5.0|Well... It's just the kind of music that makes you happy and sad at the same time. Excellent vocals, as always, from Norah Jones that makes this one of my favourite albums in a while. I totally agree with Samantha's review, this album makes you relax, smile and also dream. The song &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is amazing but the entire album is a must have.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Even if you didn't read the book, this movie is still great. It is great for kids to adults. Its a movie the whole family will enjoy. Although, some material in it may be inappropriate for little children, as there are some scary moments in it. I think its probably best for 8 and up. Otherwise, its a great movie you will want to watch over and over again. It's also got some great behind the scenes special features. This makes a great gift.
6301661737|5.0|Regardless of its length and broad assumption that viewers will have some understanding of sixteenth century Japanese feudal systems, this remains Kurosawa's best film - better, even, than 'Ran'. This is a director whose entire catalogue often pivots on imagery and metaphor, but what sets this film apart is the sheer mastery of its cinematography and incomparable attention to detail; some might say lavish attention. The scenes with warriors passing across an orange sun as light filters through to the foreground, the scenes of warrior horsemen riding along a beach as dark clouds loom thunderously in the distance  combine to evoke as few other films have done some real sense of the elegance and savagery that was the hallmark of feudal Japan. <BR>In the case of 'Kagemusha' it will probably help if you are something of a film buff, but even those who aren't will probably be impressed with it on some level.
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I saw this movie the first day it came out, I thought it was really great. The acting is good, the storyline is good. Its one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. Beats out Superman and Batman. The DVD has many unique features, including cast interviews, &quot;spidey&quot; factoids, and trailers. It also has specials that were on Tv of spider-man. Also, the loves of peter parker and drawings of spider-man. It also includes an interview with the creator, Stan Lee. Bloopers from filming are also included. Truly, its a great DVD for spider-man lovers and fans. You can spend hours just going through all the special features in it. A great gift for the Spider-Man lover.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Which Dreamed It? Alice's infamous words apply so well to this twisting puzzle of a movie to decipher. Mulholland Drive is the kind of movie you think about after you watch it, then a couple days later watch it again to make sure you &quot;Got it&quot;. Lynch has the rare talent to confuse people while still compelling them to watch his films. <BR>   The plot is somewhat hard to explain without giving away ones thoughts of what the movie means. After a woman gets in a car accident, she wanders to the home of the starry-eyed Betty, played by Naomi Watts. Watts is excellent in this movie, starting out as the innocent girl who is amzed by Hollywood, and eventually turns into something much darker and complex, as do all the characters half way through the movie. <BR>   As you can see, it's not easy to explain. The finely made film will keep you guessing, especially after the final scenes. All the performers match the I-have-a-secret look and act it out so stylishly, you feel they're acting for you personally. <BR>   WARNING: The DVD doesn't have scene selction, a decision from Lynch. But it's a good thing it doesn't, because this movie is meant to be watched through one sitting.
B000002MP2|2.0|This is Green Days best Cd and its fine if you enjoy the great music seen on MTV but if not youll probably hate it this album isnt really bad the first couple of times you listen to it but it gets annoying fast, also avoid nimrod at all costs its green days worst album.  If you want some good music to listen to Buy Strung Out they are great or Apocalypse Hoboken one of the best bands ever!
B00006J3WH|4.0|Like a microcosm of the show it was taken from, the soundtrack to the episode, &quot;Once More With Feeling,&quot; of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is far more than it appears on the surface. Sure, there are silly little tracks, like &quot;The Mustard,&quot; but even those also serve minor plot points (the problem is not limited to Buffy and her friends). Most of the songs work on several levels.<br />Within the lyrics and performances, we see the hidden nuances of characters that have remained hidden from themselves. The Anya/Xander duet &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; is a perfect example. For all that we've seen so far in this season, the couple is perfectly happy and things are progressing towards their wedding well. Some of the normal bumps and stresses that such an event entails, but nothing serious. &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; reveals not only that there are obvious troubles in their relationship that we never see, but also that there is the worse trouble of noncommunication that heralds the downfall of their relationship.<br />The songs themselves are surprising, fun and well worth a listen for fans of show. Another surprise is that the actors have surprisingly good singing chops. James Marsters, in particular, does himself proud in Spike's parts (which should be no surprise to those that know he fronts a band when not working on the show). Also, Amber Benson gets the spotlight she deserves in Tara's parts.<br />I'm glad Joss Whedon and the crew of Buffy got to do this project and that they were able to lump so much pivotal information into the episode while also making it entertaining and surprising.<br />In addition to the songs from the &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; episode, you also get the three samples of the excellent scoring work of Christophe Beck that fans have enjoyed throughout the series.
B000075BFK|5.0|how can i express how exquisite this album is. It's said after every album release, but this seems to be the greatest of them all. Every song is great.<br />This album reflects Tupac in a strong way. it has everything on here: spiritual songs, odes, thug and girl songs.<br />What makes the songs on this album stand out from songs on other albums is aside from the fact that you have the great poetry by Tupac, they knew how to put rhythms and beats to these songs. I dont know who did them but I can tell (as you will) that they really worked hard (hard!) on these beats. the beat on every single song is so huge and grand. <br />The beats are truly illustrious! and heavenly. They really make tupac sound fabulous. <br />Any fan of Tupac has to purchase this album and anyone else who is interested in hearing tupac should not hesistate to listen to this album.<br />Above all, I think this album is a perfect come back of Tupac and will (by far) satisfy the ears of a lot of Tupac fans and what we were waiting for.<br />Even rating Tupac with these 5 stars undermines how great he was, but since this is how it works, the album gets 5 HUGE stars. <br />I love you Pac!
2082025462|5.0|I never read and use such a book.<BR>I lost a lot!<BR>Thank you Doc
0316666343|4.0|Just a quick review from me:  I immediately started reading this when I picked it up because of all the hype over it lately.  I felt that for the most part it started out wonderfully and most couldn't have been written any better.  The only disappointment I felt towards it was the fact that it was too drawn out for me.  Other than that, amazing!  A must read.
B000066AC6|5.0|Yeah, there is no bonus track. The Japanese on the packaging says that there are lyrics and translated lyrics, which are exclusive to this version of the cd. That's all.
B00005RYL9|3.0|Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yet another  bigger, more expensive edition of Highlander  is on DVD.  Highlander: That ridiculous over-the-top blending of sword and sorcerer fantasy and science fiction with a modern day action film that featured Christopher Lambert and rub-your-doubting-eyes-all-you-want-it's-really-Connery, Sean Connery.  Connery is only a supporting player in the film, but the fun he seems to be having is not only utterly infectious it also injects the film with the needed charisma and energy it needs to make the goofy thing worth watching.<br />Highlander makes little logical sense, but tries to pretend it does with various conflicting explanations that never cover plot holes or explain why competitors would be so helpful and friendly with one another if they knew they might have to face each other in a duel to the death....  But never mind logic.. this is action packed pick out the continuity errors-fun isn't it?<br />UCLA student Gregory Widen (who went on to write and direct Prophecy and was one of the writers of Backdraft) wrote Highlander, as his senior thesis and attempted to create a fantastical legend about a chosen group of immortals who walk the earth for centuries, preparing for duel to the death sword battles with each other.  Mostly set in 1986, it offers the impressive spectacle of swashbuckling sword fights taking place in parking garages, modern streets and rooftops all cut like music videos.  There's a couple of flashbacks to merry old England and the Scottish Highlands that are done quite well (yes, that's the same castle used here that's used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail).<br />My favorite sequence is still the wild ride Kurgan (Clancy Brown) takes Roxane Hart on toward the end of the film.  Crazed, evil Clancy is immortal and enjoys terrorizing mortals, driving fast, and causing mayhem.  He grabs the film's ing&eacute;nue and takes her on a wild ride right over poor Mr. Toad  that is a pure visceral shot of cinematic adrenalin.<br />What keeps Highlander enjoyable and explains it's popular loyal cult following is it's matter of fact, somehow this makes sense, don't try to figure out, we're not completely serious tone. It winds up being a very silly, violent, action packed ride.  It's not outwardly campy and tongue-in-cheek (except when Brown or Connery are on screen). It's directed and edited like a music video which wasn't the case with every other movie back when this was made by  Rusell Mulcahy (who had directed many music videos).  The normally dull and wooden Lambert comes across much better than say a heavily accented Chuck Norris, Van Damme type action hero usually does, simply because the film doesn't linger on him a moment longer than it has to.  Just when the film starts sagging big time, Sean Connery arrives on the scene playing the kind of  high energy Errol Flynn you've always wanted him to play.  Things get down-right cartoonish with the proper introduction of an over-the-top bad attitude, bad guy Kurgan (Brown).  Suddenly the film feels like a WWF extravaganza with swords instead of folding chairs.  And so it goes.<br />Yes, Highlander is a guilty pleasure film.  It's fun, if you let it be.  It's got exciting visuals.  The sequels are awful, the t.v. series better than you'd think, but the first movie<br />is well... the One.<br />Highlander also features three mediocre Queen Songs that are so incongruent and wrong for the film... they fit perfectly.<br />IMAGE AND SOUND<br />Highlander was originally thrown onto the marketplace in a Republic DVD release that was one of the worst DVDs ever released. A restored director's cut version was later produced which added about ten minutes of footage to the film, and then came an improved re-mastered version.  Previous (to 2002) Anchor Bay releases have been discontinued. This new edition features an Anamorphic widescreen presentation which is superior to former editions.  The film was not made  on a huge budget and has a slightly softer focus than the crisp images  newer films have, but there were all these filters and smoke and various lighting  effects going on  and then effects were added via computer 1980's style.  You won't find much artifacting and the black levels are stronger, but details in the shadows are still lost and some of the darker scenes look pretty muddy.<br />The audio is where Anchor Bay has gone crazy making a new DD EX mix AND  a six-channel DTS mix.  Lots of  use of the various channels during action sequences.  For all the noise and flash the dialogue remains clear and easy to hear.  When the film isn't being bombastic and over the top, it's way too quiet and the sudden jumps might be annoying and sound very shrill to the uninitiated.  More sensitive viewers will want to have the remote nearby to monitor the volume control.  To those knowing it's a cheesy, campy film, this loud re-mix is perfect for the film.<br />Extra Features:<br />Well  the extras for the ...IMMORTAL package consist of the metal slipcase, a 24 page booklet of production notes and an additional disc that has three Queen songs (Princes of the Universe, One Year of Love and Friends will be Friends).  Oh you also get three Queen videos and a couple of  mediocre still galleries  as well.<br />If you're a Highlander film fanatic AND a big fan of Queen, it might be worth getting this special collectors package.  Otherwise the other Highlander DVD will satisfy you just fine.<br />Incidentally the interesting Queen version of New York, New York  (form the film) remains the only known unreleased Queen song. It is not on the bonus C.D. of this package.&lt;Pghtly softer focus than the crisp images  newer films have, but there were all these filters and smoke and various lighting  effects going on  and then effects were added via computer 1980's style.

B000075BFK|5.0|This album far exceeds until the end of time and r u still down.  The beats and lyrics are vastly improved with far superior guest perfomances then previous posthumous releases. Tracks like Still Ballin, When we ride on our enemies, Mamas Just A Little Girl, Never Be Peace, Changed Man, My Block, Thugz Mansion, Never Call U B..., and Fair Xchange carry the album.  Not since Makaveli has there been more than a few good tracks on a pac album.  This album is definetly one of the best to drop in 2002 and a definite must have whether you are a tupac fan or not.
B00000K19E|5.0|...for any collection.  I rank this one up there as &quot;one to become a classic.&quot;
0316666343|3.0|When junior high student Suzie Salmon is killed and her body disposed of by a peculiar neighbor in the early Seventies, it has a profound effect on those who knew her. Her younger sister must relearn to trust others, the only boy to kiss her must deal with the suspicion despite his ironclad alibi, her father suspects the right person for the wrong reason, and his efforts to mete out justice on his own will have unimagined consequences.<br />Yet Suzie is hovering over them all, in a teenager's heaven--with a high school like the one she never got to attend, but where she never has to go inside except for art class. The heaven contains ice cream parlors and packs of cute dogs, and other people share it to the extent they share her vision. There's even a guidance counselor to help her along.<br />Suzie soon learns that she can look down on the living, and we see their story through their eyes. Once the initial heavenly stage is set, the story is almost entirely that of the people on earth. But as time on earth goes by, Suzie learns that she can touch the lives of those dear to her--and perhaps even more . . . <br />The major flaw of this book is that almost no attempt is made to explore the ramifications of the afterlife concept the author hands us, and, really, that's the most interesting part of the book. The story is that of the people left on earth, and it isn't THAT interesting a story. <br />It's worth a read, but maybe not worth the investment in a hardcover. Library or paperback? You decide.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't too impressed after my first listen, however, the more I listened the better it got!!!  Now, after 4 listens, I can honestly say this is the best Harrison solo album!!  \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was great, but it had a few clunkers.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is brilliant from beginning to end!  There is not one bad song!  If this is not named album of the year at the Grammy's, I would be lead to believe that those responsible for the awards are either deaf, braindead or perhaps even \\"brainwashed\\" by our society, and what our \\"society\\" considers MUSIC!!!

0671891634|1.0|I can't believe this book has been reviewed 5 stars. It is horribly outdated (many companies it mentions are out of business), the writing is insubstancial and borders on join-my-Lynch-fan-club promotion. I didn't learn anything from it, other than the simple (and obvious) fact that you need to research companies before you buy into them. But when Lynch goes and tells up to call up a company CEO to ask them how things are going (as he recalls numerous times throughout the book), that's when it's worthless.<br />Save your time and money and go with someone else.
0743233832|5.0|David and Scot Hicks have brought us the penetrating wisdom of Marcus Aurelius vividly and with a freshness that seems lacking in most translations of the ancients. Aurelius wrote directly, without pomposity, naturally. David and Scot have imititated him, making him accessible. I will be using this book with my high school students, encouraging them to reflect each day on one of the numbered sections or mini-chapters. And I will be using it myself as I lead my organization.<br />One of my favorites: &quot;So you don't dazzle them with your blazing intellect. Get over it!... Let the virtues you do possess shine forth&quot;<br />Maybe wisdom and virtue are more fashionable at some times than others, but given the obvious need for them today David and Scot Hicks have provided a much-needed brick for the foundation of our civilization.

B00005JLF5|5.0|With glee I write this review for my favorite show of all time. <br />If you passed on the Deep Space phenomenon at the time, you were'nt alone. Many who had interest in TNG didn't really take to DS9 at first, myself included. I started watching it again in the second season and it slowly grab held of me. There are a few bad episodes (\\"Melora\\" for one), but overall these are the most fascinating, imaginative stories ever collected into a series of any kind. It's a saga no doubt, a soap opera of sci-fiction, but Deep Space went so much further. With great special effects and audio, the production value alone was entertaining. But the episodes were extremely dark at times too, with the greatest characters, a healthy budget and fantastic writing. This combination led \\"Kira\\" in an interview to state that she believes this will be one of the most time enduring Television shows ever created. I really agree. If your on the fence about whether to invest yourself in the series, maybe wait for the second or third season (it generally becomes a sleeker show over time). My favorite episode of all time \\"In the Pale Moonlight\\", I believe is in the fourth season. An episode where the absolute moral boundary of war is questioned and Sisko and Garek do all this crazy stuff to assure security for the federation. A Narly episode. Garek actually kills a Romulan Senator by sabotaging his craft and Sisko actually trades biogenic weapons material for information. I was stunned. There's another episode where Garek actually kills several Star Fleet Officers on Empok Nor in reaction to a violent drug meant for Cardassians. As I said, this is a pretty dark show at times. Don't miss it, treat yourself to good, exciting, well thought out sci-fi for a change. ENJOY TREK FANS! ehee! - Thanks Paramount...! it only took a decade.
B00006CXSS|5.0|the cast, realistic settings and costumes were of the highest order, as was the directing.  The realism was overpowering.  Best war saga I have ever seen. Proud to say I served with this unit in Vietnam.
B000066NW0|5.0|Finally a girl who wont let &quot;Holleywood&quot; go to her head. 1st Britney aimed to our young girls to buy her CDs as soon as they did and made her millions shes barly wearing clothes and forgetting who made her BIG. Avril wants to be herself. I like her music and its a CD I do not mind my daughter listening to. She tells people to be themselves..how can that be wrong? So many female singers feel they need to undress to sell but not Avril Lavigne! If u r shopping 4 a pre-teen or teenager this is one u want to check out!
0375414053|3.0|Although I was totally engrossed in this novel, and thought that Kate was a very real and often sympathetic character, I ended up with very mixed feelings about this book.   I am a mother who has temporarily given up a career I loved to stay at home with my kids.   This wasn't an easy decision for me, and I would never criticize those who made a different decision (or who have no choice in the matter).  I was shocked at the venomous comments about stay-at-home mothers from Kate and from other reviewers of this book.   While I am sure that there are some stay-at-home mothers who take pleasure in making working mothers feel bad (they are probably the ones who are at-home because they feel like they should be, rather than because they want to be, and are miserable themselves), I believe that most of us have alot of sympathy for the sacrifices and trade-offs that working mothers are forced to make.  And, frankly, most of us are too busy getting through our own days to worry about what others are doing. The descriptions of stay-at-home moms as spending all of their time at the gym, having manicures, writing notes for playdates, was just ludicrous.   I have two toddlers and I feel incredibly lucky when I have the time to shower in the morning or get out for an hour by myself to go shopping.   Being a stay-at-home mother isn't easy, neither is being a working mom, and I find it incredibly sad when we have to insult each other in order to feel better about our own choices.
B00006LLLN|4.0|This live set has its moments of excess, but on the whole it's a nice return to Alison Krauss's more straightforward truegrass roots.  It's nice that the live format has allowed her to recapture a simpler, more stripped-down sound: I just wish she'd do the same on her studio albums, as well.  Recommended for her crossover fans, as well as more traditionally-oriented bluegrass fans who may have wearied at hearing the growth of Union Station's increasingly ornate pop-grass approach.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt continues to display her mastery in combining musical elements from different cultures to come up with seamless, heady compositions that are uniquely her own.  \\"The Mummers' Dance\\" and \\"The Highwayman\\" are standouts.  McKennitt's breathy, understated vocals never overshadow the richness of the instrumental arrangements beneath them, the sound of her voice becoming just one more instrument in a swirl of plaintive laments and passionate fire.  Words seem inadequate to describe this kind of music, a product of such lushly creative imagination that it is difficult to conceptualize if you haven't actually heard it.  So go find a link to click on, and listen.  And once you've heard, you'll understand, and the words won't matter.  McKennitt's prolific and innovative work to date has been truly seminal, bringing inspiration to a planet-full of listeners and opening new vistas in world music.  It's been six years now since she has released an album of new material, and I understand she's endured some difficult times in the interim.  Loreena, you've already accomplished more in one lifetime than most of us could in many.  But if you find more music in your heart, whether similar to your past work or different, we would be graced and honored should you choose to share your visions with us once again.  Blessed be.
B000003TAR|4.0|I often think of 'In Utero' as a phoenix, risen from the ashes of 'Nevermind' after it slipped off the charts, leaving Nirvana with the most talked about band in the early nineties. An improved Phoenix, with more mature lyircs and more mature music, as opposed to 'Nevermind' which no doubt had mature lyrics in many parts, but just not to the extent that they have in 'In Utero'<br />'In Utero' starts off with a rough-around-the-edges rock song which you could put on a White Stripes album and no one would know the difference, yes it is 'Serve The Servants' and when this album came out, any person who bought it woud get home, put it on, hear this song and think \\"What the hell is that\\". However this all stops when we get to the next track 'Scentless Apprentice' this song almost sounds like 'Aneurysm' even to the point of the screeching guitar when the song comes to a halt, only to give us perhaps what some might call the best lyrical masterpiece from Kurt, 'Heart-Shaped Box'. Yeah maybe you and many others were thinking that maybe it is time for an 'In Bloom' type song, well the fact is that this is more of a 'Come As You Are' both musically and lyrically similar, and this was the first single from this album, with a strange film clip and depressing song you only know it could be Nirvana. And when you think about it, one every album, track three is slow or depressing. From their first album the third track is 'About A Girl' a slow type song that has almost depressing lyrics but then again a good song. From their second, and most poular album to date, 'Nevermind' they bring you 'Come As You Are' which is a quite slow song, but with a fairly hard chourus, and now 'Heart-Shaped Box' which is perhaps the most depressing of all Nirvana songs, right next to 'Come As You Are' and if you think you have heard 'Heart-Shaped Box' before but have never heard Nirvana that is probably because Nirvana brought seattle out of the shadows and helped along 'Pearl Jam' and even the grunge-masters 'Smashing Pumpkins' and went along to even todays style 'Creed' a christian seattle/grunge group. Next we have one of my favourites, 'Rape Me' which shocked me at first because the intro sounds so much like the 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' intro, and i thought it would be the complete same guitar backing new lyrics, how wrong I was. This song mixes the roughness of Bleach's 'About A Girl' with the melancholly style of 'Come As You Are' and finishing with a chourus of pure gold, resembling the true Nirvana style and showing up it's preccedor. Next there is a song with an extremely long title 'Frances Farmer Will Take Her Revenge On Seattle' which is also a song that has a verse similar to that song we all saw with Kurt dressed up as a woman live, 'Aneurysm' and if you like that song you have got to be happy with this one. 'Dumb', our next song is a simple acoustic ballad which also features on 'MTV Unplugged Live' which is a good album to get into if you wish to follow songs like this and get the real deal. A Unique original is what I think of the next song 'Very Ape' although it seems like I have heard this riff somewhere else before, this song is fast paced, heavy and you could almost say \\"Nirvana has gone punk\\" if they made an album like this. Next we come to a Silverchair like song, or also similar to The Offsprings 'Pay The Man' this song is called 'Milk It' and I can't really get what this song is about, and I cant hear what Kurt is saying either, so it is time to get the lyrics book out when listening to this song. 'Pennyroyal Tea'? what sort of song name is that for a grunge/seattle band you think well this song has very deep lyrics about some type of addiction or some type and is depressing aswell as hard-rocking. Oh No, it's that screeching guitar from 'Aneurysm' again you think, infact you could say this is a sped-up version of 'Aneurysm' and not very original at all, but the lyrics, not so much the title (Radio Friendly Unit Shifter) is quite meaningful song about people that are opposites and attract but it dosen't turn out so great after-all. 'Moderate Rock!' says a well spoken voice just to start before the riff kicks in and the song sprouts into a full-bloom of a song made up of.....GIBBERISH!, even the lyrics book says the lyrics as 'whatever' and you could almost say the song is living up to it's name of 'Tourette's'....yes. All Apologies is the name of that song that you hear on the radio and think are you sure this is Nirvana? I thought it was Oasis! Yes this is the type of song that Oasis would sing, but I'm a huge fan of Oasis so I'm not too worried about this song. Yes there is a hidden track! it could be an addition to All Apologies, or it could be gibberish or it could be something to kill time, who knows? nobody, after all this song is only a 'Devalued American Dollar Purchase Incentive Track That Lays Gallons Of Rubbing Alchohol Flow Through The Strip...
0792837614|5.0|The first two reviewers are either too young or too stupid to figure out this movie.  One only need look at the present and see that the same problems and solutions exist when people react in the same way that the characters in the movie did.  I believe the first two \\"critics\\" should stick to movies like \\"Jackass\\" and/or \\"Southpark\\"; or any movies with farting, puking, or burping.  These types of movies seem to be best suited for such intellectual geniuses such as they.
B00007BHOE|5.0|Any Slipkn0t fan owes it to themselves to check out this DVD.  The sound is top notch, 30 cameras provide a definitive look at the chaos that is Slipkn0t live.  Do what you need to do to get this, live without Beer, Food, Sleep, whatever.  Buy it Maggot!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge, is by far the greatest love story ever written.  This spectacular story about love, is told through song and it is a must see for the &quot;hopeless romantic&quot;.  The first fifteen minutes are intense, but give it a chance and I know you'll enjoy it like you've never enjoyed any other movie about love.
B000004C32|5.0|I don't speak or understand the French language, I stopped drinking alcohol 20 years ago and don't approve of smoking BUT Serge Gainsbourg (almost as famous for his boozing and smoking as his music) is one of my great heroes. I love his music so much I got a tattoo of his face on my arm ...and for me Histoire de Melody Nelson is his finest 28 minutes. It's mystical, sexy, seductive, dirty and even a bit vulgar. A concept album about doomed love for an English teenage girl, played by his greatest muse and partner Jane Birkin on the record and the glorious record cover. Birkin stands teasing in just blue jeans clutching a cuddly monkey to her [chest]. Jane told me that she placed this monkey in Gainsbourg's coffin with him when he died. The beautiful iconic cover would be worth the price of admission alone but the music is even more mesmerising. During the 60s and still in in 1971 when this album was originally released most people were content to make variations on a theme created by The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson... but what Serge offered, his brand of pop, had a completely different and individual voice. The gophic bookend tracks of the album Melody and Cargo Culte sound extraordinarily modern even today. There is great tenderness and melancholy in Ballade de Melody Nelson and Ah! Melody. Witness the sound of Jane Birkin laughing hysterically over the grooviest of 70s psych-grooves on En Melody. Birkin was actually being tickled by her brother Andrew while Serge had a tape running on record under her bed. Don't be put off by the short running time, length doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts.<BR>Histoire de Melody Nelson is ultra cool, ultra sexy and ultra modern music. <BR>Je T'aime, Gainsborg.
6304884419|5.0|the best thing about this movie is seeing the everyday life in the bronx the way it was then it paints a perfect picture and thats what the director - deniro is responsible for.
6300214435|5.0|I'm a little surprised by some of the bashing this movie receives.  Yes, it does have a weaker story than either Raiders or The Last Crusade, but it does have the most action in the series, particularly the thrill-packed finale, one of the best extended action sequences ever put on film.  The action scenes here are a bit more polished than in Raiders of the Lost Ark and there's more humor, and even a kid sidekick, which might annoy some.  Overall, probably the least of the series, but even at that, it's still the third best pure action film of the 80's (behind you know what two other films).
B000021Y7X|5.0|I make it short at the risk of repeating what almost everybody of the reviewers have already stated: This IS the best music DVD. Amazing that this is 1984 vintage - but unmatched by most modern concerts. Watch it - and enjoy!
0792157869|5.0|Anybody who's seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade knows it's an unsurpassable adventure.  It's got all the great action of Raiders of the Lost Ark, twice the humor (in quantity and quality) of Temple of Doom (which was, admittedly, the most action-packed of the series), and more character development than both combined.  So that's why I'm getting a little impatient waiting for the DVD of my favorite action film.  This was definitely the perfect to a magnificent trilogy.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is a genius. Plain and simple. There's no other word to describe him. \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" was hot but \\"The Eminem Show\\" totally blew it out of the water. From \\"Business\\" to \\"Cleaning out my closet\\" to \\"Solider\\" to \\" Say good to hollywood\\" to \\"Sing for the moment\\"(a hot song with Aerosmith) to \\"Superman\\" to \\"Hailies Song\\" to \\"till I collapse\\", this cd has someting for everyone. Forget the image, forget the controversy, and buy this cd. It is worth your money.
0316666343|5.0|Bravo!  This book was poignant, funny, fresh, and despite its imaginative, almost fanciful, premise, real. <BR>My only problem is trying to imagine how Sebold will top this debut novel.
B0000024SD|5.0|'Bringing It All Back Home', is in my opinion the first Dylan album that he re-invents himself on; for on this album, Dylan goes electric. On songs such as; 'Outlaw Blues', and 'Maggie's Farm, Dylan pulls out his electric 6-string and does his thing. <BR>But the most important thing about this album is the lyrics. <br />Dylan has been praised for many a-time as one the most prolific and best songwriters ever; and to tell the truth all of the hype is true. i mean he has lyrics such as: 'i wake up in the morning/ theres frogs inside my socks' you have to be a genius and/or high to come up with lyrics like that; Dylan was probably both. <br />but the true highlight on this record is 'It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)'; the song with my favorite beginning 'darkness at the break of noon/shadows even the silver spoon/the handmade blazing childs ballon/eclipses both the sun and moon/to understand you knew too soon/there is no sense in trying' amazing. you can't really go wrong with 'Bring It All Back Home'. besides 'Blood On The Tracks'; this is Dylan's most eclectic record to date, and probably the best of his career.
0786867973|4.0|I must admit that I am an &quot;American Cookbook Snob&quot; and I literally refused to even look at this book until my sister urged me to do so. Our satellite TV company does not get the Style Channel, so I am unable to see Nigella's show that my sister talks and talks about. Obviously, I gave the book a try (thanks to my public library) and I was very pleasantly surprised. <br />Ms. Lawson writes about food as if she is writing you a personal letter from her kitchen. She really does make the food sound attractive and &quot;lures&quot; you into baking something. . . anything! In addition, as a mother, I was extremely impressed at how often she talks about her daughter(s) and the joy she has with them in the kitchen - that was great to read. Most of the baking is divine. However, the cooking (savory) section is a bit too Brit for my taste; our family just doesn't eat that kind of food, but if you like that kind of stuff I'm sure you'd enjoy her recipes. <br />I am purchasing this book for myself for Christmas simply because those cupcakes and Madeira cake (without Maderia!) sound just too delicious to pass up.
B0000584V3|5.0|Does opeth rock? Oh yeah. Is Blackwater Park the best metal album in years? Possibly. Although the music is brilliant, complex, paradoxical, dark, uplifting, heavy, acoustic, extremely sad, and cathartic, its all about the mood. This is a high concept black metal symphony. <br />My jaw dropped to the floor after two songs. Which are the best on the CD. \\"The Leper Affinity\\" and \\"Bleak\\". This album is extremely frightening. There is a presence here. An evil, all-consuming entity. Listen, and you can feel it. Look out your window and you can see it. Think about someone you've lost and it will enter you. It resides in a place called Blackwater Park, where the sun will set forever, never to rise.
B000065V9N|4.0|This album does sound like it was made in 1986, and is very accessible and mainstream oriented, which honestly made me cringe the first time I heard this, but I've since warmed up to 'So.' I do prefer the weirder elemtns of his music, exemplified in Melt, Security and his latest opus, Up, but even when Gabriel's stuff is more pop-oriented, he's still outstanding at it. Songs like 'Sledgehammer' and 'Big Time' are very catchy, and his romantic song 'In Your Eyes' is one of the best love songs ever written. &quot;Red Rain,&quot; &quot;Mercy Street&quot; and &quot;That Voice Again&quot; are also highlights on this album. Never was a fan of &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; though, so I can't give it 5 stars, but it certainly deserves 4.5 stars.
B000075BFK|5.0|I realy like 2pac and his new cd \\"Better Dayz\\" this cd is the [stuff] and i recomend you buy it or download it and all the rest of his cds. My opnion is, 2pac to me is the greatest rapper and we need to keep his music alive. so tell your friends about 2pac. And if he isn't dead his plan worked. well we will all miss but still rember Tupac A. Shakur.
B00006V9A0|5.0|this album is i thought pretty good. although i do agree that it is missing a few needed songs on it. but its still nirvana, and i rate it a 5. and that one person entitled A MUSIC FAN. don't talk about what you don't know. and whats funny is that Kurt Cobain was more than you ever were and ever be, plus your probly just as no good(in your terms) as he was. perhaps even worse. also you have no right to dis the music that others may find sanctuary by listening to it. and one last thing, what exactly is your spectrum of music? so if you can dis my music, i'm sure gonna dis on your crap.
B00005NP04|5.0|I have been listening to Martina since I bought her album, Evolution. I then bought Emotion and now this Greatest Hits album. This collection of songs are extremely powerful, especially, Independence Day and Where Would you Be.<BR>  Her voice is powerful and unique, most of the songs are familar, but the three new tracks are equally wonderful.<BR>I recommend this to everyone![.]
B00003CXI0|5.0|I loved this movie.  The second one is a little better though.  The dvd says it has extra scenes that i could not find
B00005JKDR|4.0|This movie is good, but I just can't rate it as high as Shrek!  I thing the whole concept is a little much for kids under 3 or 4.  I was impressed with the imaginative story line as well as the animation.  Worth the $.  I just wish movie makers would quit using up so much time on advertising at the front of the movie (this one is especially hard to get to PLAY; my DVD player is only 5 months old).
0316666343|5.0|Wow!<br />What an astounding gift from the literary Gods!  Alice Sebold's profound understanding of human beings and grief is obvious from the first bittersweet word to the last. <br />As for those readers who picked apart the plot and didn't get the metaphors, all I can say is, &quot;This isn't an episode of Matlock, folks!  This is a LITERARY novel!&quot;  (Some of us get it, some of us don't.)<br />I happen to be an author, too, and tend to read with a critical eye.  I was blissfully lost in &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot;<br />Thank you, Alice Sebold!  I will read all of your other work!
B000002L1L|5.0|Deep Purple's mark 2 final effort!Battles rages on deserves the 5 stars for two reasons:some of the songs-Lick it up,Talk about love, Time to kill might be just good and always pleasant to listen to but some other songs like the groovy RAMSHACKLE MAN, SOLITAIRE, ANYA, THE BATTLE RAGES ON, ONE MAN'S MEAT are some the best songs of mark 2 reunion.I really believe this album is as good as PERFECT STRANGERS, it just didn't come out as such a surprise!<BR>The second reason why this album deserves 5 stars is probably because being aware of the fact that Blackmore wasn't going to surprise us anymore with DP, he left the band not long after which gave a enormous rebound to DP's carreer and this might not sound like a good reason to buy this album but it is in fact!BATTLE RAGES ON is Blackmore's ultimate legacy to all purple fans and the last notes on this album might be the very last he created for DP and we should really enjoy them!
B00004Z459|5.0|Quite simply, this is a great CD built by a great band,   anyone should be able to see this.  It is worth buying, and it is worth listening to.  I would like to add that this is a band good enough to make it worth owning a copy of the remix, even when you have this CD.  It is definately good enough to buy.
B00003CXCD|5.0|If you have seen this movie before you are in for a treat, fullly restored will all the dirt removed from the film negatative the picture quality of this DVD is amazing.   Ms. Hepburn is even more stunning then I remember her, as if that is possible.   If you have not seen this movie, get the DVD, this movie in my opinion represents the best in hollywood movie making, what seems to be light fare is really an amazing story of love, friendship, and duty.  Todays dirctors would do well to study this movie and how a love scean, were the main charaters embrace, full clothed can be 1000 times more intresting then a sex scean will the characters totally naked.
0321146530|4.0|While the first two parts of the book: &quot;The Money Example&quot; and &quot;The xUnit Example&quot; may seem discontenting for an experienced XP'er, the third part: &quot;Patterns for Test-Driven Development&quot; is amazingly impressive. It brings lot of valuable patterns: Test-Driven Development Patterns, Red Bar Patterns, Testing Patterns, Green Bar Patterns, xUnit Patterns and Design Patterns. Despite the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; seems to be provisioning, design in test-driven-development requires a slightly different look at design patterns, and Kent Beck has done his best in providing not only the common vocabulary, but a gainful technique not known to be described anywhere else before.<br />Before the publication of this book, there was a lack of a good manual for xUnit testing framework. The title &quot;Testing Extreme Programming&quot; by Lisa Crispin and Tip House, released a couple of month before this book, didn't fill the gap. This book is the first significant guidebook for xUnit ever released. While the work &quot;Extreme Programming Installed&quot; exposes most valuable testing experience among other XP titles, it didn't focus on xUnit as well.<br />I would recommend &quot;Design Pattern&quot; and &quot;Refactoring&quot; in addition to this book, assuming that you are aware of the XP manifesto: &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot;.
0553106635|5.0|You can't keep the Championship title forever. Just ask Ali or Tyson. It may be sad, but its true, G. R. R. Martin has replaced Tolkien as the ruler of the fantasy world. The First two books in This series were the best books i had read in years, and this one was even better than them! It is really rare for a series to get better in latter volumes (ask Jordan or Goodkind) but George shows us that it can be done. This book is also 922 pages! it doesnt cut any corners like some other series where they release a 450 page book when all their previous books in the series were 700+ pages (and charge the same price of course)<br /><br /> This book carried on where the last one left off, We spend lots of time in the north and begin to see why there is a Gargantuan wall there in the first place!... and of course the usual (for these books) slaughtering of MAJOR characters... G. R. R. Martin offers no more protection to major players than he does to a peon in some field. Anyone can die (and does) which is a nice change from Goodkind (Richard will never die) or Jordan (where its likely only Rand will die) And the major ones that ones that do \\"live\\" can find themselves short a hand, or have their throat slit, or framed for murder of a king.... Oh, Ya, one of the many kings gets \\"offed\\" in this book too..<br /><br />Its no wonder G. R. R. Martin wants a cast of 1000 characters over his 6 books, considering the rate he kills them. I just wonder if 1000 will be enough? The next book is called \\"A Feast for Crows\\" which implies a lot more dead bodies...I cant Wait!<br /><br />Buy This Book, Buy 2 copies actually since you will wear one out from reading it.<br /><br />This series ROCKS and IS the BEST fantasy series ever bar none.<br /><br />Thank You Mr. Martin<br /><br />Relic113
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band continues where Revolver left off. This album was just as innovative, with The Beatles covering every musical genre from pure hippie physcadellica (the<br />classic Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds) to Eastern chants (Within You, Without You). Let me take this time now to explain with Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is really about. It's not about LSD, contrary to popular belief. John Lennon wrote the song after seeing a picture John's son Julian had drew. The picture was of a young girl in Julian's class named Lucy. Are we clear?<br />There are other great tunes,such as the lovely ballad She's Leaving Home, with a harp as the only intsrument on the song. Another favorite of mine is Lovely Rita. A nice physcadellic pop song, it has some vey innovative sounds on it. But the album's best is the closing stunner A Day In The Life. With a bonechilling orchestral arrangement by George Martin, the song has two halves to it. The first half begins with the haunting acoustic guitar strumming opening and Lennon's spooky echoey vocal. The second half is nice uptempo part song by Paul. The thitd part goes back to the beginning, then culminates with a spinetingling orchestral part and loud crashing piano part. This album is The Beatles' best.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I'm getting a ton of these for friends for the holidays. This is a big, rich plum pudding of a collection and points up again Streisand's remarkable career as a chance-taking artist. Most singers have never even done one duet, much less the range of them included here. ... I found the two new songs of the moon-June-spoon genre but she of course sings them brilliantly and she sounds great with Manilow and Groban, who themselves sound great. Warner Brothers is a silly Christmas goose for not letting Groban's name be included in the ads or cover sticker for this album--it would have enhanced sales for his new concert C.D., actually. The ghost of Christmas Commerce does hover over this project but that doesn't make it musically any less bright and shiny. One final note: The Kim Carnes and Don Johnson duets somehow have taken on new lustre with time. That's not new with Streisand music--I think the entire \\"Till I Loved You\\" album today sounds much more brilliant than it did when it first appeared, for example.  My Barbra wish list:  The Hollywood Album, once and for all; an album of Harold Arlen, the music she does better than any other (oh to hear her sing \\"It Was Written in the Stars\\"); a singles boxed set including the alternate versions and B sides so many people don't even know exist; and a down and dirty torch song album with a touch of the blues, because with \\"Moanin' Low\\" she certainly showed that was an area in which she excelled.  I think the NICEST thing about Barbra's career is her fans still take her seriously. The temptation when any artist has sold so many records, scored so many successes and become a living legend is to begin to discount them and even make fun of them (why, I don't know, but that's certainly typical of our culture).  With Streisand, you always know just around the corner she'll come out with something totally surprising and eye-opening (think of the first album, the \\"People\\" album, the French album, \\"Stoney End\\" and \\"Barbra Joan,\\" \\"Guilty\\" and \\"Christmas Memories\\" just for starters).   And right now we're all wondering, what will it be?  <BR>And we're waiting.
B000002UAR|5.0|With the release of Revolver in 1966, The Beatles began a change. With this album, they broke away from the bubblegum pop of Can't Buy Me Love and I Want To Hold Your Hand. An experimental album here, they range from George Harrison's famous Taxman to Paul's aching masterpiece For No One. And Got To Get You Into My Life, Paul's alleged drug song, has a nice hippie feel to it. Even Yellow Submarine has an experimental feel to it. The closing Tomorrow Never Knows is a great track, although noone knows what John Lennon is saying. Complete with sitars, guitars and louds of percussion, this is one of the band's best. Starting with Revolver, The Beatles changed.
B000075BFK|5.0|2Pac latest CD puts an end to any arguements as to who the greatest rapper of all time is.2Pac was murdered more than six years ago in Las Vegas,since then he has relesed 5 albums of all new material,3 of which are double albums including this one.He has also released one spoken word poetry album(The Rose That Grew From Concrete),and a double disc greatest hits set.All of these have sold at least one million except his poetry album, which wasn't expepted to,and Better Dayz,which is well on its way.The content of this album is just as impressive as his other muti-platinum albums.You might be thinking people are buying up his albums because of the mystery surrounding them.That's not the case,this CD deserves to be considered one of the years best.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road was the last album The Beatles recorded, and it left a us with a lasting legacy. The album is by far their most innovative one sice Sgt. Pepper, and it has many classics, most notably Lennon's uptempo Come Together and George Harrison's quiet acoustic ballad Here Comes The Sun (one of my faves). And let's not forget that the album featured Something, another classic coverd by Elvis and Sinatra. And it includes Ringo's fun<br />Octopuss's Garden. The album has rather silly songs like Paul's rather odd Maxwell's Silver Hammer and You Never Give Me Your Money. But it's the medley of Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came Into The Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The End. The songs do not break making it one long song. Roingo's drum solo on The End is possibly his single greatest drum contribution. He also steals the show on Carry That Weight. listening to both tracks, I realized that Carry That Weight was the conclusion of You Never Give Me Your Money. I also liked Lennon's tribute to Yoko, I Want You (She's So Heavy) and Paul's sweet Oh, Darling. Abbey Road is a masterpiece.<br />But then again, almost all their albums were.
B000062Y98|5.0|It's worth it just for \\"The Soulforged!\\"  Come on, people.  They wrote a killer song about THE coolest fantasy character ever imagined--The one and only Raistlin Majere! If for no other reason, buy this CD!
B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback's third major album - following Curb, and then The State, had two great hits which became well known to people everywhere - first off &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, and then later on &quot;Too Bad&quot;. <br />However, having listened through this album many times, I can't help but feel that 75% of the songs have a sort of beat, or tune, that those others do too. Sure, it's different, albeit not by much.<br />The CD is worth a listen, but expect it to get a little repetative after a month or three.
0792101448|5.0|This epic goes beyond Western. That it has never become a more popular movie is hard to believe, how many times do you get to see Henry Fonda play a true bad guy? He's right out there with performances by any current \\"bad guys\\" like Malkovich and is evil to the core like Lecter. Sweeping, desolete beauty of the southwest is at once both stunning and sometimes frightening. There's a true feeling of how \\"bad\\" it must have been in those lonely times. Bronson brings an interesting, mysterious quality to his character and the haunting notes of his harmonica accentuate every one of his scenes. The final view of a set of evil blue eyes that have now seen the result of their ways, closes this story in a fashion that will leave everyone who sees this for the first time stunned that this is \\"just\\" a western.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I got this DVD as a gift, and set about watching it without knowing anything substantial about the plot - actually, I knew nothing about it.<br />I must say, it's not often a horror movie makes me jump in my seat - with this film, it happened twice. I knew John Carpenter was a great director (I love Big Trouble in Little China), but this movie was really an unexpected gem. As John himself described, the effect of the horror in this film wasn't so much what it portrayed, rather what it hinted on portraying.<br />I don't want to give up the plot (it's VERY well written and the background story is excellent), but I would recommend you watch this film without reading the back of the DVD case. And if you don't want to take a chance with your money, rent it first. I'm almost certain you'll want to buy it later.

B00006JKON|5.0|It's always nice to have bonus tracks added onto to these Jethro Tull re-releases to give these remastered collections more bang for your buck, and to give more recent fans some of what they might have missed from the 'twenty years of' box set. In War Child's case though they seem less like bonus tracks than they do essential elements missing from the original work. Mixing the lot in to the work, rather than leaving them as tag ons at the end, they make this already excellent record seem more  complete. Not that the record ever seemed lacking before, but hearing these tracks now I can't imagine listening to this recording without having these bonus songs added in.  Where they belong in the set is quite up to your own discretion, but I suspect most people will find similar homes as those that I did without even mentioning my selective order. As for the remastering, it's another excellent job, making this brilliant work shine like the diamond that it is. There's a joy to the singing and performing of this musical trip through the afterlife that makes death sound like the liveliest party on earth, or beyond. It's a sort of humorous version of a Passion Play laid out in shorter bits, rather than as one giant slab of continuous music. On this record Death isn't grim at all: he's a scythe swinging party animal and the funeral home plays waltzes instead of dirges.

Some people say that it doesn't compare to Californication, but I think it is even better than Californication. People are telling me 'Oh, the Chili Peppers have lost their funk!\\" but they are WRONG! Just listen to songs like \\"Can't Stop\\" or \\"This Is The Place\\", even \\"Cabron\\". They all have funk. I cannot tell you how great this CD is. I encourage you to go out and buy this CD. I PROMISE YOU that you will enjoy it.

0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton, in his latest book \\"Prey,\\" has returned to his \\"Andromeda Strain\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\" roots.  The hot topic of the day seems to be nanotechnology, which is also the theme of at least one other recent novel by a popular author.  Nanotechnology, for the uninitiated is \\"the quest to build man-man machinery of extremely small size, on the order of a hundred billionths of a meter.\\"<br /><br />The main character in \\"Prey\\" is Jack Forman, an out of work scientist, with expertise in creating computer programs that model biological processes.  Jack is now a saintly stay-at-home dad, who takes care of the kids while his wife, Julia, works long hours at a mysterious company called Xymos.  Julia and her colleagues are using nanotechnology to generate exciting medical applications.  During the rare occasions when she is at home, Julia is tense and argumentative, and Jack suspects that his marriage may be in trouble.Only when Jack is hired as a consultant at Xymos does he discover that Julia and her colleagues are working on something that is top secret and extremely dangerous.<br /><br />For the first half of the book, Crichton does a bang-up job of creating an intriguing and frightening scenario.  Since the reader has no idea what is wrong at Xymos, Crichton drops little innuendos and subtle clues to fire up our curiosity.  By the time we get to Xymos, and Jack starts to sniff around, we are ready to be shocked by the revelations to come. Although there is gore and fright aplenty to please fans of this genre, Crichton is unable to sustain the excitement and intrigue throughout the novel.  The ending is forced and a bit silly.  There is no character development whatsover.  Crichton's didactic theme is that man must not let his arrogance lead him to overreach, lest he unleash uncontrollable forces.  This theme has been done to death, and it is getting a bit stale.  However, I still give the book four stars for the dynamite beginning and for the fascinating primer on a technology that is real and absolutely amazing.y that is real and absolutely amazing.
B00004XQ83|4.0|My 3 year-old is absolutely hooked on this CD, and now my 1 year-old also!  My parents saw the movie, bought the CD, and played it frequently for my son, who has virtually demanded his own copy and now listens to it in our home DAILY. He even has a favorite version of Man of Constant Sorrow.  And now I've really gained an appreciation for the CD.  I try to expose my kids to a diverse selection of music already, and this CD is a really nice addition to our collection.  If you appreciate the older country sound, or a tune that will transport you to a simpler time, this is a great choice!  Big Rock Candy Mountain &amp; In the Jailhouse Now are just terrific fun.  I'm considering looking into other CDs like this-- any suggestions?
B00002SWEM|5.0|If you were born in Cuba, you will relive your past. Everytime I play it, my parents start talking about their lives, what Cuba was like and the meanings behind each song. Their eyes sparkle with a nostalgic joy that no other CD or documentary evoked in them. <BR>If you are not Cuban, you will still love this item for its musical and historical value. The songs trace geographical, social, cultural and historic pictures of Cuba. Ibrahim walks the streets of New York with the admiration and respect that we Cubans feel for USA. The unique smooth, soothing voices, melodies and Caribbean rhytms fuse to create a documentary (or CD if you buy the CD) of a quality that has never been produced before and that will be difficult to surpass. <BR>This is a true collectible for serious music lovers, historians, anthropologists and, of course, Cubans and Cuban-Americans that want to transmit the pride and history of their good ole Cuba to the next generation. No one should miss this one.

0811833887|5.0|What's surprising is that in this book there is hardly any screenshots or CG graphic art.  But that's what makes the book great!  It really proves that computer does not dominate in the animation industry; everything is still from sketches and traditional works.  The book filled with great works from Eggleton (director of &quot;For the Bird&quot;) and many other amazing script illustrators.  The only thing that is disappointing is that most of the images are already available in the Monsters Inc. DVD.  Overall, no animator should miss this book!  Don't want to miss those amazing prints!
B00007G1ZC|4.0|I've been waiting for Dreams to come out on DVD ever since I got my DVD player. It's movies like this (grand and visually stunning, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) that are real must-haves for a DVD collection.  I have seen Dreams several times on video tape (unfortunately, I've never seen it in the theater) and hope that the DVD doesn't disappoint.<br />Let the beautiful and poetic stories wash over you.  Don't look too hard for literal meaning, rather enjoy the vignettes as sort of visual poems or music.  This is one of my all time favorite movies and I can't wait to see it on DVD!
B000001Y42|1.0|Yes Apparently repeated listening causes impotence. Seriously though this is thye apex of Limp Bizkits art, if you can call it that. Difficult to absorb in one sitting yet devoid of any underlying integrity this is an album that will sit umcomfortably in your collection. Until the day your girlfriend drops you for owning it. Take my advice buy Gentle Giants &quot;Power and the Glory&quot; and see just how drastically Limp Bizkit have failed in their artistic vision. Anyone showing this band sympathy should consider their reasons and question their self esteem. Avoid at all costs.

B00007E8V4|4.0|Although a collection of previously unreleased tracks that were only partially finished (recorded durring the &quot;Toxicity&quot; sessions), I agree that every song on here was definetley good enough to make the final cut. I'll break it down song by song...<br />1.) Chic 'N' Stu: Very interesting lyrics. I'm still trying to figure out what it means... it's more than just food here. However, this is one of the very few System songs where Daron (guitar/back up vocals) sings in a normal voice. Very cool! 4/5<br />2.) Innervision: The new single from the album. If you got this from the net a while back (like me), this version is better overall with some revised parts. Arguable the best song on the album. 5/5<br />3.) Bubbles: Life in a bubble jungle! I admit, some of these songs catchy for having such political lyrics :) Good song. 4/5<br />4.) Boom: Something VERY different from our Armenian friends. The whole song is spoken as a poem, by Serj, except for the chorus. 5/5 for the originality alone.<br />5.) Nuguns: The opening chords may have you wondering if this is some kind of remake of &quot;Prison Song&quot; from Toxicity. Pretty good song overall. 4/5<br />6.) A.D.D. (American Dream Denial): You may have seen Shavo laying down the bass tracks for this song durring the &quot;Toxicity Backstage&quot; video. One of my favorite songs on the album. 5/5<br />7.) Mr. Jack: For now, my favorite song on the album. Has kind of a gloomy feel to it, much like &quot;Spiders&quot; from their self-titled debut. 5/5<br />8.) I-E-A-I-A-I-O: Serj in a display of his ability to sing the impossible in a mumbling of tongue twisters. Beautifully sung chorus. Interesting song. 4/5<br />9.) 36: A 46 second track of (mostly) screaming and brutal guitar riffage. Nothing special here. 3/5<br />10.) Pictures: Another great What-The-Hell-Kind-Of-Music-Is-This-Song from S.O.A.D. It kicks booty! 5/5<br />11.) Highway Song: Shows of Daron's back-up vocal skills quite well. Pretty good song. 4/5<br />12.) F**k the System: You've probably heard this song before as it has been very easily available on Kazaa for a while. Sounds more like the type of songs they were writing on their self-titled debut. 4/5<br />13.) Ego Brain: Probably one of the top 5 songs from this CD. It's a bit different from what they usually make, but it's great none the less. 5/5<br />14.) Thetawaves: A song that would've fit in just fine with the &quot;Toxicity&quot; line up. 4/5<br />15.) Roulette: Something different from a nu metal band. Features Daron on guitar/back-up vocals and Serj singing. I love the lyrics! 5/5<br />16.) Streamline: Up in the top 5 of this CD. This seams quite different in some aspects than the downloaded (Scorpion King Soundtrack) version but I never bought the soundtrack so I'm not sure. VERY good song. 5/5<br />The only reason I gave this CD 4/5 is because there are very few records that I feel really deserve a 5 star rating, despite the fact that I gave 5/5 stars to some of the songs. However, this CD is  definetley worthy of any nu metal fan's collection, S.O.A.D. fan or not.
0060507772|5.0|If you like Terry Pratchett this book is a must have.  Period.  The story is excelent, but the art is amazing.  There is a picture on almost every page as well; the characters appear just as I've always imagined them.  The story itself is a bit short, it only took me about five hours to read the book through, but the art makes it a worthwhile buy.
B00006LLLN|5.0|i have to disagree with the reviewer who did not like the crowd noise.  i think it adds tremendously to the excitement of this live set.  When the crowd breaks out in a cheer - it makes me smile and get even more pumped for this outrageously GREAT double-disc set.  The performances are absolutely flawless and stay solid true to the original recordings.  What a fantastic blend of New Favorite tunes, older classics and O Brother Where Art Thou - all rolled into one dynamite set.  Thank you so very much Alison, Dan and the boys.  Can't praise it enough.  Recommend it HIGHLY.
B0000640VO|5.0|I've seen this movie three times, and it's interesting to note what I thought of the movie each time.  At first viewing, I thought that this was one of the strangest films I had ever seen. It was beyond different -- it forged an entirely new trail in moviemaking. At the end I thought to myself, \\"well, that was interesting.\\"<br />Then I viewed it again on DVD. This time I began to appreciate  the subtle storyline, and the brilliant colors on screen. I began to relate to the character(s) more.<br />The third time I saw it, I finally understood why this movie got such high reviews and praise from critics.  It is a work of art, a classic, that should adorn the shelves of any DVD collection.  If anything, get it because it's in French, and you'll look more intelligent than the average one-language-only American.
6304983778|5.0|This movie was one of my first Santa Claus movies ever. I saw it the first time when I was a little boy and yesterday I saw the movie again in TV and I could still remember all the scenses. I love that movie and I think it's one of the best x-mas movies ever!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite DVD that I own.  There has never been any movie made like this one -- totally unique and engaging.  Tom Tykwer's film really sticks in your head, as you follow the lives of two main characters, and see how one little event in time can change the entire tragectory of their fates.<br />This is an excellent, amazing, artistic gem that I want to get two of, just so that if I lose one, then I'll have a backup!
B00006IR5S|5.0|Once again, John Williams has come through with a wonderful, magic-filled soundtrack for Harry Potter. The Chamber of Secrets score is even more expressive and noteworthy (pun not intended); if you've seen the movie (or even if you haven't), you can almost pick out the scenes from the movie by listening to the music. I especially love the \\"Fawkes the Phoenix\\" theme. \\"The Dueling Club\\" always gives me chills--mostly because of the ending part (I remember Harry's Parseltongue in the movie--it still creeps me out!) The only \\"nitpick\\" I can lodge, as far as the arrangement of the CD, is the songs are not in actual sequence, but that's okay.<br />There is a cool extra available with the CD, for those who play piano: the sheet music for Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is available NOW for download. You can actually print out sheet music from this movie to play, and if you have the Music Notes player utility (you need to download it from the site in order to print the music, anyway), you can use the CD to \\"play\\" the sheet music on your computer. That is, when you have the sheet music on the screen and the CD in your computer, the selected piece will play and light up the notes on the screen in sequence. It's neat and helpful to hear and see it this way, as a musician. Otherwise, if you \\"play\\" the sheet music on the screen without the CD, the player does an adequate job of playing the piano version for you. However, it only plays it \\"mathematically\\" correct; it doesn't accent the notes or notation parts correctly, but at least you get the gist of what the piece is supposed to sound like on the piano. Another note: when you play the music with the CD, the notes will sometimes stop in the middle of the song (example: the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" score does this). On PC/Windows computers, don't worry too much about this; it only means that that part of the score wasn't written for piano. The notes will start up again.<br />As of my last viewing of the site, The Music Notesutility now lets Macintosh users view and print sheet music from the site, but they still don't have the actual player available yet. The company FAQs section for Macintosh assures us that they are currently working on the issue, but a compatible program is not expected to be released until 2004. (Say WHA-A-T?!)<br />In summary, WONDERFUL CD, WONDERFUL and SURPRISING extras.(Get the CD, anyway. Hogwarts Forever!)
B000002OZY|5.0|Like most people, I had only heard the biggest hits that came out of this album, but in order to grasp the full picture that Pete Townshend created you have to listen to the entire work. And it is superb, indeed.  From the first notes of 'Overture' to the stirring finale of 'We're not gonna take it/See me, feel me/Listening to you', the listener is in for a musical treat, the type of album that is just not made or attempted any more. According to the booklet that accompanies the CD, there were very few overdubs and layerings added to the original master tapes, the end result being that the superb musical skills of the quartet are more clearly displayed and brought to the forefront.  Strangely enough, even though it was released thirty-three years ago, the album still sounds fresh and powerful today, a testament to its excellence. A landmark work for The Who, and a must for anyone's pop/rock collection.  Highly recommended...
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's brand new album Stripped is certainly a diary brought to life for everyone's ears to experience. With touching tracks such as: Beautiful, Soar, Cruz, and I'm Okay this album is truly inspiring. The rock ballads are so wonderful such as: Fighter and Makeover (Which is my favorite track on the album). When Christina sings you feel her happiness, and emotion going into it. She displays her most darkest secrets in this album, and shows the world that she can be an artist just as Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, and Madonna are. Stripped will get you dancing,thinking, and inspired. If you are in the mood for a touching album please buy Stripped because it is in my opinion the best album of 2002, and I doubt any new release can top it!
B00005OC0G|5.0|From the opening subdued timpani notes to the final glorious romp, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and the New York Philharmonic directed by Kurt Masur give us a thoroughly convincing performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.  Called &quot;the greatest young musical talent since the young Menuhin&quot; by conductor Herbert von Karajan, Mutter has become one of the preeminent performers of our time.  Although twentieth-century music is her specialty, Mutter is equally at home with the great Romantic and Classical music.  This CD groups the Beethoven Violin Concerto with his two lesser-known Romances for Violin and Orchestra.  Predating the larger work, these Romances have the character of the inner, slow movement of the concerto; introspective and melodic rather than bombastic virtuoso display.  Lovely as these works are, especially the second Romance, it is surely Mutter's performance of the Concerto that is the selling point of the disc.<br />Beethoven above all composers balanced the various musical parameters--relying not solely on melody and harmony, but also exploiting the drama of rhythm, spacing, texture and dynamics.  Mutter's work in contemporary music has given her a special sensitivity to these techniques that serves her well here. In particular, her use of timbre and delicate awareness of timing is enviable, as she subtlety varies her sound according to the music's dramatic goal.  Performing on a Stradivarius violin, Mutter carefully balances aggressive stridency, transcendent darkness, and crystalline lyric soaring.  How anyone could imagine that Mutter is incapable of performing with a light touch, as one of the previous reviewers has commented, is inconceivable to me.  Mutter is surely aware of the particular challenges of the piece--in the liner notes an interviewer specifically comments &quot;though it isn't a virtuoso concerto, many violinists consider it perhaps the most difficult one in the entire literature&quot;, to which Mutter replies, &quot;Yes, that's right&quot; and then continues at length about those difficulties.<br />I do have one serious disagreement with one of Mutter's claims in her notes, that &quot;Beethoven always had trouble writing a beautiful melody.&quot;  (This in response to the question, &quot;How do you feel about the melodies of the first movement&quot;)  Nonsense, pure and simple, albeit often repeated nonsense, probably first uttered by Leonard Bernstein.  It is certainly documented fact (from his remaining notebooks) that Beethoven worked on certain ideas at great length--the opening of the first string quartet occurs in embryonic form in a notebook predating that quartet by ten years.  Some melodies have a certain naivety, such as the Ode to Joy theme--but considering the multiple counterpoints set to it, such simplicity is inevitable. Further supposed evidence for the argument is that the nature of certain first movements are scarcely melodic at all, most notably that of the Fifth Symphony.  How could a composer incapable of writing a beautiful melody compose the theme of the SECOND movement of the Fifth Symphony, or the Third Symphony, for that matter?  Or the Pathetique Piano Sonata, first and second movements?  To think that Beethoven wrote this way because he could not write a decent melody is not only to ignore the evidence, but also to totally misunderstand the technique involved and the greater artistic vision.  For Beethoven, a first movement was often more motivic rather than melodic--the difference being that a motive is the shortest recognizable musically meaningful statement (often only two or three notes), and a melody or theme is considerably longer.  A theme may or may not contain motivic writing; but motives, to be effective, must be introduced at the beginning of a piece.  Imagine the beginning of the Fifth Symphony if it were instead the second movement, and a long, melodic movement had preceded it--the result would be an artistic disaster.  It is not that Beethoven could not write such a tune, he could and often did; it is that he did not always feel that such themes were appropriate to his opening rhetoric.<br />Nonetheless, Mutter performs superbly, and Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are her equal partners.  They support Mutter's artistic vision completely.  Very highly recommended.at Beethoven could not write such a tune, he could and often did; it is that he did not always feel that such themes were appropriate to his opening rhetoric.<br />Nonetheless, Mutter performs superbly, and Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are her equal partners.

The story and popularity of this book are of course well known, so I will briefly tell you my Of Mice and Men story:    I was in grade eleven (but taking grade ten English), hated school, had loser \\"friends\\" who I studdornly refused to disassociate with despite the fact that I knew deep down they would ruin me, when we had to do a reading assignment for English class.  Not wanting to be bothered by it all, I chose the shortest one that I could find: Of Mice and Men.  My teacher tried to get me to read a longer book--why then was Of Mice and Men on the list then???--but I refused.

0767903374|5.0|If you have read Elaine Aron's original book &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; and have determined that you are *definitely* an HSP, then the next logical step in personal development might be to buy this workbook-- especially if you find yourself struggling somewhat in your dealings with the world.<br />&quot;The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook&quot; *can* stand alone, but I would HIGHLY recommend reading Dr. Aron's original book on High Sensitivity before attacking the Workbook.<br />This is definitely an excellent tool to teach the HSP how to become more of an &quot;expert&quot; on themselves, and their sensitivity. HOWEVER, I must also caution that the book might be a bit daunting, or overwhelming, for the individual to work their way through on their own. As such, I would characterize the book as &quot;superb&quot; in an HSP support group setting, but perhaps only &quot;good&quot; to &quot;very good&quot; for an individual. That was certainly my personal experience after I bought the Workbook. I made a number of &quot;false start&quot; attempts at working through the exercises in the book by myself, but it wasn't until I got involved in an online &quot;HSP study group&quot; (not so diffuclt to find, by the way) that I managed to get all the way through. Having completed the workbook, I will say that it was a thoroughly worthwhile effort!<br />Here's what you get:<br />This Workbook is essentially a journey of Self-Exploration for HSPs. The early chapters address how to identify and become familiar with your sensitivity; subsequently Dr. Aron takes you through sensitivity in childhood, in social intereactions, and eventually in the context of the workplace and adult (intimate) relationships. Finally, there are sections &quot;deeper wounds&quot; and psychotherapy; medical and health issues, and finally Spirituality. There is also a discussion on setting up, and working within, an HSP group setting.<br />The focus of the chapters is generally on self-examination, &quot;re-framing&quot; past negatives related to your sensitivity, and practical suggestions for ways to go forward. Each chapter has many exercises which are mostly designed to be done in writing, as they require considerable reflection before formulating an answer. This is definitely where a &quot;group discussion&quot; setting becomes most helpful.<br />To get the maximum benefit from the workbook, you DO have to be &quot;emotionally honest.&quot; As such, some of the exercises may be quite difficult to some readers-- since they ask you to look at parts of your life history that may be very painful, as well as areas in which you may feel that your sensitivity is (or has been) a &quot;character flaw.&quot;<br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially if you have a support group-- or maybe just a couple of HSP friends-- with whom to share feedback on the exercises.mination, &quot;re-framing&quot; past negatives related to your sensitivity, and practical suggestions for ways to go forward.

B00005Y228|4.0|Fever, Fever in the morning, fever all through the night...Kylie's fans would hum their way with this release of 'Fever' and she's proved to shine out all through the days when she sang with Jason Donovan 'Sealed with a kiss'. Kylie &amp; jason's video n audio tapes are jes great and I knew this sweet girl would make up 'Big' someday. Her 'Locomotion' song was cool stuff and here with a Bang is on my top pop list 'Fever' with my hot fav 'Can't get out of my head'. More, more, more is a wonderful dance track to sway around with 'Fever' the funky song to pick one high and a gr8 europop of all time. Kylie Minogue is sure pick if the choice is a mix dance n ballad style. One thing is amazing of Kylie's videos is that she looks bubbling, fresh n oh so charming that one couldnt stop listening to her songs. Her songs are always great to listen, any place, any time. A cool Pick, thats Kylie Minogue, My choice for sure.
B000002513|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., introduced him to the world as an ambitious, unique songwriter who juggled words better than anyone had in the rock field since Dylan, and who was also backed by a madcap, frenetic band. Springsteen's verbosity is just as wild and uncontrolled (or very nearly) here as on the first album; the main difference between the two records is this: the playing of the E Street Band. They are far tighter and more professional-sounding - and much more impressive - here than on the debut. This is immediately apparent from the opening bars of the semi-title track, The E Street Shuffle. Deftly crossing the by-no-means-thin lines of rock, folk, jazz, funk, and pop, Bruce's words here are given the virtuoso backing treatment that they deserve. The band is wild and frenetic, seemingly about to spin out of control at any moment - but they never do. That is what makes this album so fun to listen to. The opening montage of New York City Serenade is perhaps the pinnacle of the E Street Band's musicianship - here we have a masterful opening sequence comparable to the prog rock that was so prevalent at the time of the album's release. Conventional wisdom says that this album is marred by poor production and shoddy playing - nothing could be further from the truth. I have just been commenting on the impressiveness of the band; but, aside from that, the production, though certainly not top-notch and not comparable to Bruce's later, more polished efforts, is fine - in fact, a touch above that on the debut. As for the quality of Bruce's songs themselves, it need hardly even be said that they are universally outstanding. This is one artist who has put out consistently outstanding albums throughout his career; this one is no exception. No sophomore jinx here. This contains probably his most epic songs ever - particularly the suite on the second half - even more uncontrolled, wild, and just plain good fun than the ones on his debut. Although his writing would later come to be clouded by cynicism and a world-weary tone, this album was made at a point in Bruce Springsteen's life and career where he was still wild and exuberant with a youthful enthusiasm - and it shows in the music and the lyrics. Soon to turn to shorter songs and darker subjects, Springsteen would never make this kind of album again - all the more reason to pick up this all-time classic.
B000059QY3|4.0|La Traviata: Surely this one work must have the highest ratio of great songs and recognizable tunes in all of operadom.<br />This production at Covent Garden stars Angela Gheorghiu as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Leo Nucci as Giorgio Germont (Alfredo's father). The conductor is Sir George Solti. The camera placement and switching, as well as editing are  well done. The sets were appropriate for the scenes depicted, although the non-party scenes were rather drab and austere. Angela Gheorghiu's dresses were sumptuous and a compliment to her good looks and figure.<br /><br />I found the opening scene, although well done, rather stiff. It is in the final two acts, however, that the singing and acting ability of the performers comes through. Angela Gheorghiu interpretation of the fatally ill Violetta is nothing short of breath taking. Her use of hand action and facial expressions to augment her mood is extremely well done and conveys the delight or sorrow she's feeling at any given time.<br />Frank Lopardo has a wonderful voice and acts out a very credible Alfredo. The final scene with him and Violetta is heart wrenching.<br />The only weak acting performance is that of Leo Nucci as Georgi Germont. He seemed to me to be very stiff, mannequin like, and in a couple spots in the middle act he looks directly at the camera. I find when this happens I lose my sense of involvement in the performance and I'm snapped back into reality: Annoying! (Thus the loss of one star)<br />The background music of the final act is the epitome of the melody perfectly fitting the mood of the scene that is being preformed. (In this case Violetta last moments before dying)  Angela Gheorghiu' is at her absolute best in this tragic ending and the chemistry between her and Alfredo will touch your heart.<br />All in all, a magnificent performance.  A La Traviata worth having.
0684847817|5.0|An excellent book for people who enjoy Fantasy Art and anything related to faeries and goblins. Bryan Froud developed this great book from beautiful faeries to the grotesque, he takes his immagination to a different level. Bryan Froud worked with Jim Henson in &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and several images from &quot;Good Faeries, Bad Faeries&quot; were adapted for Jim Henson's film. There are other books that may accompany &quot;Good Faeries and Bad Faeries&quot; and that is the one by his wife Wendy Froud &quot;The Winter Child&quot; and &quot;Midsummer's Night Faery Tale&quot;.

B00006IRHA|2.0|Yeah, when I was watching this movie I fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes later and fell asleep again and just to think that before watching this movie I had a really good night sleep, I guess with this movie it doesn't matter. Works better than a sleeping pills, don't watch it more than once, danger of not waking up. No wonder they included toy with the movie, so you won't get bored watching it, at least something exiting. The reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because when I fell asleep I had a nice erotic dream...
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This CD is just great.  There isn't a bad thing that you can say about the album.  The music and the vocals are just amazing.  If you have an older copy of this album, it is still worth buying this version for the extra tracks.  If all you have is the LP or tape, buy this CD, the sound quality is so much better.  All of the songs are great.  After all, with over 50 million copies sold, it is the largest selling album ever.  He is the King of Rock, Pop, and R&B.  I never get tired of this album.  Just do yourself a favor and buy it.
B00005JKES|5.0|If you love Twin Peaks just buy this DVD collection, because you will enjoy watching them forever. But I do worry that so much attention and art went into this first season, will they ever complete all episodes. I pray so, this program influenced so much of TV thereafter it should be recorded in a format to last forever. Hell, I am ready to order every episode now in the new DVD format!
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this CD.  I don't have any complaints about it.  Not only do I think that this is the best Metal Band to come out lately, I think this is the greatest metal band ever.  The music is great, as well as the lyrics and vocals.  Chester's voice is just great.  I have listened to this album over and over, and I have never gotten the least bit tired of it.  I can't wait to see what they put out for their next Studio Album.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne have compiled a selection of tracks that provide a quick slice of new material from George's solo career for all to hear.  There are the Wilbury sounding \\"Any Road\\", \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\" (notice the opening riff from \\"Put It In A Cool Dark Place\\"?), and \\"Looking for My Life.\\" \\"Brainwashed\\" mixes the Wilbury style with a VERY slight touch of Indian mysticism. There are the Cloud Nine sounding pieces \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" and the \\"All Things Must Pass\\" sounding piece \\"Marwa Blues\\".  Then there is \\"Pisces Fish\\" which I see as George's tribute to the influence that Bob Dylan had on his music.  \\"Run So Far\\" and \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" have been available to collectors for years, but are very welcome here with their value-added production.  The former celebrates the relationship with Eric Clapton (George had given this to Eric to release years ago) and the later demonstrates George's love of the Hoagy Charmichael musical style that he \\"discovered\\" during \\"Shanghai Surprise.\\"  The bluesy style of \\"Rocking Chair\\" adds a touch of George's love for his tropical Hawaii home.  The lyrics throughout confirm that George truly was a spiritual man.  He was ready to live on with his maker.  This album is an essential part of the Harrison coda.
B00007E8V4|5.0|After being on an internet hiatus for about 6 months, I finally check back only to find out my favorite band (SoaD) has a new CD out on that exact day!<BR>I rush out to the store, buy it and within a matter of minutes I'm listening to it full blast (the only way to hear SoaD)<br />Unfortunatly, I had head all these songs before when I downloaded them online.  They haven't been released generally, but they've all been on the net under different names. <BR>But it doesn't matter.  Even if you've heard them all, hear them again.  They're all great.  <br />It's about time System of a Down came out with a new CD...  And this one seems a lot more like their first CD, loud, fast, and not as popular to the \\"general listener\\" as Toxicity.  <br />So far System of a Down is 3 for 3, with their latest album, just as great as the previous.  And that's pretty damn great...
B0000636UN|4.0|...and your devoted fans who learn of you from an earlier album, when you were in a different frame of mind, will crucify you for changing your mood.  They do this, no matter how good your recent material is.<br />Most of the people who wrote this fell in love with Sheryl right after her eponymous second album and &quot;The Globe Sessions,&quot; which itself continues the thought begun on the second album's &quot;Home.&quot;  Sheryl apparently went through some rough and disillusioning times between those two records; her anger and cynicism made the ballads [&quot;Riverwide,&quot; &quot;Am I Getting Through&quot;] devastating emotional lows to go with the teeth-clenched fury of the Stones-sounding rockers [&quot;There Goes the Neighborhood,&quot; the last forty-five seconds of &quot;Am I Getting Through&quot;].  In that album's reviews, most of her critics accused her of losing her sense of humor and vitality, grinding out another record due to contractual obligation.<br />They were wrong then, and they're wrong now:  &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; is a good balance between pop, rock and country, showing a lot of different shades of arrangement and style of which most of her peers are incapable.  Listen to the wall-of-ahhs Beach Boys chorus in &quot;Soak Up The Sun.&quot;  Listen to her vocal harmonies with Lenny Kravitz on &quot;You're An Original,&quot; that bring to mind Mick Jagger's studies in euphonious but stark contrast with female vocalists on many of their Seventies records, particularly the later choruses on &quot;Gimme Shelter.&quot;  Sheryl has worked the full range of styles of popular music, as a professional musician; this does not make her less intelligent or pointed in her songwriting because she opted for a more cheerful sound.  I wonder if half of the people who called this album simplistic have really heard &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; &quot;You're An Original&quot; or &quot;Safe and Sound.&quot;<br />I still believe that her best studio album is &quot;The Globe Sessions,&quot; but I would hope for Sheryl's sake that she never finds herself enduring the same levels of emotional suffering and rage that made that album possible.  This one has a happier, more polished sound, but it's still better than ninety-seven percent of the entire recorded output of the Los Angeles or Nashville studios in 2002.  If you like the singles or already like her from her earlier work, buy it.
B000002MFN|5.0|Madonna is always one step ahead of the trend.  Erotica is no exception.  This was the first album released after her mega-successful Immaculate Collection.  But while Immaculate was full of the bubble-gum megahits of the past decade, Erotica does a full 180!  Starting with the title track, the albums delves into a dark, underground world.  On one spectrum, the dance beats are hard, the basslines are strong, then there's Madonna herself whispering in your ear (\\"Erotica\\", \\"Where Life Begins\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Secret Garden\\").  On another spectrum the music is slow and melodic, yet still has an air of darkness and melancholy (\\"Bad Girl\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"In This Life\\").  And then there are a couple of songs with extremely fierce dance beats filled with an undying energy (\\"Deeper And Deeper\\", \\"Thief of Hearts\\", \\"Words\\", \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", \\"Fever\\").  <br />    Back in 1992 when this album was released, the music scene was still trying to adjust itself to the 90's.  Erotica's underground sound turned out to be way ahead of its time.  This album could almost be released today in 2002 and almost sound completely fresh.  As a precursor to Madonna's Sex book this album also provides a sort of soundtrack to the fantasies of Madonna's then-alter-ego, Dita.  As it turns out, this was Madonna's worst-selling album commercially although it did go multi-platinum.  That's a shame since this is such a remarkable record, but the world was not ready for sexual fantasies to start circulating in such a mainstream way.  I believe this is one of Madonna's best albums...right up there with Ray of Light and Music!  I think I'll go listen to it right now....
B00005JKBC|5.0|Where can I start. THis movie is so exciting. Robert Redford stars as the retiring spy with one last job in mind. To save his long time spy trainee that he trained a long time ago. The actors are great in this movie. And this DvD is packed with special features. Even if you dont like thrillers I think you should at least watch this one.
B00000099Y|5.0|It is hard to put this album into words. Every single song on this CD makes you want to just...rock out. Out of all of these fast-paced songs, &quot;H.&quot; would have to be my faveorite. &quot;Stinkfist&quot; is a great opening song to this CD. Because like all songs on this album, it has great lyrics and even greater melodys. <br /> Now I have been a Tool album since I first heard &quot;Sober&quot; all the way back when Undertow came out, but this CD has to be the greatest and holds the most classic, more then any other Tool album. This is a must for all rockers, and Tool fans alike. And is without question, worth the money. own a piece of music history...But Aenima today!

B00005QIPH|5.0|this was such a shock...  i completely expected a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; to come of this with &quot;last night&quot;, but lo and behold, i LOVE the whole album.  can't get enough of it, and can't wait for the next installment!
B00006M183|5.0|I should begin with a disclaimer and mention that TEN is my least favorite album.  I feel that the band had grown and matured with each successive album, until BINAURAL had come out, which I felt was a step back from the incredible NO CODE and YIELD albums.  However, after waiting weeks for this one to come out, I was in awe of what they had created with this record.  Each song is truly it's own being, and the whole beast is nothing short of amazing.<br />&quot;Can't Keep&quot; begins the album with a slow, burning menace, underscored by a hushed Vedder.  Let this one roll over you in your headphones.  &quot;Save You&quot; is next, and quickly turns the tempo from rumble to overdrive.  The band pumps this one out with a fury unseen in a long time.  The tight rhythm of Jeff Ament and Matt Cameron really pull everything together, as Ed belts out a plea to a friend coupled with his best scream on record in years.  &quot;Love Boat Captian&quot; is a beautiful song with a perfect example of how Ed's voice has grown for the better over the years.  Boom Gaspar's Hammond B3 really drives this one, and his prescence adds a new flavor to many of the songs. &quot;Cropduster&quot; is the first example on the album of Cameron's writing, and stands out as one of the better rockers on the album.  &quot;Ghost&quot; has a garage-stomp reminicent of Neil Young's unreleased &quot;Born To Run&quot; to go along with some of the best lyrics Ament has written yet.  &quot;I Am Mine&quot; has a beautiful waltz rhythm, and again is another example of some of the best lyrics in the bands history.  &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; is Vedder's tale of lost love, very soft and understated.  It would've fit nicely on Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA.  &quot;You Are&quot; is one of the more experimental tracks Pearl Jam have ever tackled, with Cameron feeding a guitar through a drum machine for a very trippy effect.  Cameron also gets a lyrical credit on this one.  &quot;Get Right&quot; has a Who-like chorus, another rocker that's both catchy and gritty.  &quot;Green Disease&quot; is a bit of a poke by Vedder at the Exxon's of the world, and has an intro that's almost the opposite of &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; from VS.  &quot;Help Help&quot; could win the award for creepiest Pearl Jam song ever, and another example of how Ament is growing as a songwriter.  This might be the strongest song he's written yet.  &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; is the marriage of Ed's spoken word rant on our 43rd president and a doomy Stone Gossard riff, for consequences both creepy and hilarious.  &quot;1/2 Full&quot; is a straight up rock song, and Mike McCready's playing owns this one.  &quot;Arc&quot; is an amalgamation of Ed's voice overdubbed 10 times upon each other, creating a haunting piece of music.  &quot;All Or None&quot; is simply one of the best closing numbers that they've written.  It's reminiscent of &quot;Indifference&quot; in feel.<br />Put all of that together, and you have the best album of 2002, and maybe the best in a few years.  If you haven't bought it already, go get it now.

At best this is a decent (not great) rock CD with some creative tracks and a few cool ideas. ... Dave Grohl (yeah, that's nice) but there is something soft about this record, something kinda boring and \\"been there before\\" that puts me in a foul mood. ...
B000003S0F|5.0|Early in King Crimson's career, there is relatively unheralded couple of albums in between the first pair of symphonic/jazzy prog rock (_In the Court of the Crimson King_, _In the Wake of Poseidon_) and the heavily praised Fripp-Wetton-Bruford years. These two albums are _Lizard_ and _Islands_. They never received the warm critical reception of other favorites, and truthfully they are kind of like freak cousins to the rest of Crimson's library.<br />The first of these was _Lizard_, which even to this day is the jazziest of Crimson's output. A year later, _Islands_ followed, mixing up that jazzy element with some chamber music. It is dark and mellow, but it can be roiling and tempestuous at times as well. There is a certain \\"prettiness\\" to this album - from the florid classical style of \\"Song of the Gulls\\" to the limpid vocals of Boz Burrell peeping throughout, _Islands_ is ear-pleasing symphonic jazz/rock -- minus most of the rock.<br />Except for the \\"Ladies of the Road\\", that is. It reminds me of the Beatles, and has aged about as well (i.e. not so good). Lyrically it is kinda foul (dealing with groupies and such), plus Peter Singfield's fustian poetry doesn't really work with the subject. Still...it's kind of irresistible with that darn flaring saxophone. Broo-raow!<br />Band leader Robert Fripp stretches his compositional side here rather than his guitar playing. Still, the success of _Islands_ is not attributable solely to the grace of the mighty Fripp. Mel Collins' flutes and saxes are key fixtures in the music, and Ian Wallace's jazzy rhythms lay down a quiet dynamic where the other instruments have space to play in. Extending the credence of _Islands_' unique sound is the addition of a few other important instruments, including piano, strings, and woodwinds.<br />Side 1 of _Islands_ is excellent, although such a distinction is irrelevant on the CD. The epic \\"Formentera Lady\\" is a deep, serene piece -- very very good. \\"The Letters\\" is breezy and poetic with disconcerting bursts, and the jazzy instrumental \\"Sailor's Tale\\" is ominous and tense with some very nice drum work.<br />Side 2 is likewise a treat. The classical flavored piece \\"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\\" is an oceanic beauty, segueing comfortably into the closing title track, a gentle epic with some gorgeous instrumental themes, especially the jubilant sax ending. And \\"Ladies of the Road\\"...well, other people probably like it more than I do. It's an O.K. song.<br />_Islands_ is a great album, I think. If you have maybe been turned off by some negative responses to it from other King Crimson fans, I think you should give it a try yourself.

0792833201|3.0|MY RATING- 6.9<br />It's quite a frightening mov directed by Tobe Hoper and co produced by Spielberg, thing that is visible with atempts to scare all of us.<BR>This time Spielberg challenge us with a house that has a lot of paranormal disturbances. The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts. <BR>We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear. <BR>The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the  time the midget said \\"This house is clean\\". Too early to say that, I think--<BR>One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter!<BR>Overall, a nice spooky flick, but not the best of the genre.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System has been blasting in my ears since the first self titled album.  Never before had I been blown away by the music like that album.  Their use of styles from all around the world in the hardcore scene is not only unique, but and exploration of sounds that you wouldn't normally hear in the metal scene.  Toxicity had not impressed me as much as the first album.  Although Toxicity is still a great album, I was eager to hear what these guys were going to come out with next.  This album is fantastic.  Serj and Darren are harmonizing a lot more on this album than ever before and it sounds great.  And they have kicked the technical aspect of their tunes up another level.  Anyone who is a System fan will love this album, I recommend it to anyone, and keep my fingers crossed that the minds in the band keep bringing a smile to my face and pains in my neck.
B00001MXXH|4.0|I was sceptical about watching this again, some fifteen years after it was released . I could remember the storyline, but thought it may have become dated. What a surprise to find that 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is still a great film - and extremely clever too. I actually enjoyed it more this time around. I would class it as a true 80's teenage movie classic - up there with 'Breakfast Club' and '16 Candles'. Watch this, and then watch Matthew Broderick in 'Election', it's amusing to see him play a teacher after playing a devious student in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'. Matthew is an excellent actor, both of these films are a must for your DVD collection.<BR>DVD Evaluation - Has no extras at all.  Picture transfer is excellent, sound quality is average.
B000002N3J|5.0|About 65% of this album are just great. The other songs are also not bad but not my favourites. I give five stars because the songs are not bad at all. It's just that I don't like them.<BR>I want you:(with Massive attack) This is her first electronic song. I didn't like it at first but after a while it's just irresistible.<BR>I'll remember: This is one of the weaker ones because it's boring. Taken from a soundtrack.<BR>Take a bow: This was a huge hit. I liked it at first but now not so much anymore (?) Taken from the album 'Bedtime stories' <BR>You'll see: A new song. I absolutely love it. Lyrics and sound are just great.<BR>Crazy for you: This is one of Madonnas best songs ever. A passionate and simple song is it's own way. You don't hear something like that very often. Taken from the 'Vision quest' - Soundtrack.<BR>This used to be my playground: This song needed to grow on me. Now I love it. ALso taken from a soundtrack.<BR>Live to tell: Another nice ballad. Taken from 'True blue' <BR>Love don't live here anymore: Even though this song was released on her album from 1985 'Like a virgin'&quot; . It has been released as a single ten years later. On the cover it says that this is a remix but it's exactly the same version as on &quot;Like a virgin&quot; <BR>Something to remember: From &quot;I'm breathless&quot;. I don't like this song. <BR>Forbidden love: This R n'B song is taken from &quot;Bedtime stories&quot;.<BR>One more chance: A new song. I think it's the worst on the aalbum because she doesn't sound good here.<BR>Rain: Her wonderful Power-ballad from the album &quot;Erotica&quot;<BR>Oh father: This one has a very unique style: There was a time when I really liked it but now it goes on my nerves. It's from the &quot;Like a prayer&quot; album<BR>I want you: (Orchestral with Massive attack) : Just with orchester. Very athmospheric.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I will make this simple and quick. If you like action and twisted storys this is the movie to watch. One of John Travolta's better movies.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams has done it again with his musical score to &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.&quot;  I bet he is again going to be nominated for an Oscar for this and hopefully win it this year.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Fawkes the Phenioux&quot; and &quot;Moaning Myrtle.&quot;
B00006JDVV|3.0|Great special effects, ok acting, explosive action, and a bald Matthew Mconoghey! Not to mention the dragons, which were impressive, even though they mostly barbecued the people rather than eating them. And i did expect to see the battle between the Apache helicopters and the dragons. But, for the most part, the movie was great. Highly recommended.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I have just finished watching Donnie Darko and feel compelled to write about it.  Though I am not sure what to write.  I fear I might say something to detract from its greatness.<br />It plays like a dream and leaves you wondering about your life like no other film.  It is beautiful, profound, thought provoking, striking.....<br />Just watch it.
0767803434|4.0|It's easy to understand why Air Force One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from evil again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fueled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President at the time.<br /><br />But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.<br /><br />But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.<br /><br />If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.<br /><br />And try to spot three villains from Beverly Hills Cop 2 and one villain from Beverly Hills Cop 3. They're all here.
6303534422|5.0|A Goofy movie is the best movie of all time!  The first time I saw this movie was when i was in the 4th grade and I used to watch it over and over and over because I loved the characters and I especially loved the songs!  I'm a Sophomore in Highschool now and I just watched the movie again for the first time in a couple of years and I still love everything about it!  I want the soundtrack for christmas now! heehee!  Bye bye<br />~JuJu
B0000696I0|3.0|This film opens with tremendous confidence and energy. The humor of the Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it. The opening scene in the shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the sequel. At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale, so the plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now.<br />I have no doubts that if this movie were made today it would not be subtitled 'The Secret of the Ooze'. One can hardly expect high art from a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II but they could have subtitled it something a little less crass. Apparently taking place right after the first movie (where's Casey) it wastes no time bringing back the Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan.<br />This time Shredder aims to steal the cannister of ooze that mutated our heroes so he can make his own monsters to avenge his defeat. The result is Tokka and Rahzar and it seems like a half-attempt at a live-action version of Rocksteady and Bebop. As you can imagine, this plot isn't very clever. But the movie never really lulls so long as our heroes are on screen.<br />Look out for a cameo by Vanilla Ice (looking alarmingly like Dolph Lundgren) at the end. It's so dated it may be difficult to watch but as long as your alone you won't have to cringe.<br />The DVD has wonderful motion menus as well as a great 1.85:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras are thin but still it's a great buy.
0783225970|5.0|Scarface ahs got a little bit of every gernre except for children's ofcourse. This is just a great movie of Al Pacino's, His best followed by The Godfather.
B00005MAM2|4.0|I know there is a new DTS version out in the Japanese language but I do prefer this DVD because it contains the dubbed English 5.1 track. There will be a lot of people out there who are die-hard purists who will disagree but I feel that the subtitled version of Akira just takes away some of the humor and timing of the 'acting'. I would never watch a dubbed live action film but there's no reason to feel guilty about watching anime dubbed in English.<br />This DVD itself is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and has quite a few extra features. Sadly tho, none of them are new. In fact the main documentary is from 1988. I wish I got the limited edition when it first came out but...I missed it.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Americana at it's best. I am not generally a soundtrack fan, but this one is fun and the music needs to be listened to more than once to be appreciated. Simply fun.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I loved this CD, and with the garbage out there right now; you could safely call this one of the best CDs in years and one of Stevie's best overall.  I think I like this just as well as Bella Donna, if not, better!  It is a more fun album then Bella Donna because it makes you want to get up and dance.  I thought BD's songs were a little dramatic, which is not fun.  You know what I mean?<br />Anyway, her voice sounds great.  It is deeper, but she doesn't have that cracky sound in her voice anymore.  I think her voice has gotten better, actually!  <br />I love the cover art!  Very stevie-ish!  <br />On the title track it is wonderful and very catchy.  Candlebright is one of my least favorite track, though.  Then Sorcerer is a nice song but still on the lower end.  Everyday is a nice song that is very radio friendly and then Planets of the Universe is my favorite!  One of my all time favorite Stevie songs!  Too far from Texas is nice, but country-ish.  That made me stronger is wonderful and a great song!  Some other noteable songs are Love is, which is the only real ballad; it is beautiful!  Bombay Saphires remindes me of being on a tropical Island!  Very fun song!  I miss you is a slow, but somewhat boring song.  Still catchy and a nice ballad.  Love changes is one of my favorites and I can't get enough of it.  I love It's only Love, too!  All in all, a great disk and there are no songs to skip over.  Just a few that are not on par with the rest, but still worth a listen!  Get it now!!!!!!!
B0000507R0|5.0|I had my DVD player hooked up wrong.My previous review needs to be revoked.One listen to the disc and I was listening all day.My profound apologies.
B00000AFWW|5.0|You can't deny Courtney Love's genius ability to write songs(especially when you listen to Nirvana's \\"Heart Shaped Box\\",co-written by Courtney).You also can't deny Courtney's passion when she sings songs.Furthermore you can't deny this album.COURTNEY LOVE ROCKS!... Period.
B00005LC3Y|4.0|I watch this movie about 10,ok I lost count by now.The thing I like best about this movie is that it is not a comedy but still funny.Gunnery Hartman is hilarious.He did a great job playing a senior drill sargeant.At first he wasn't even choosen for this role.He was on the set to show how a drill sargeant would act and did such a good job they gave him the role,thank god.This movie is a must see and own.
0451169514|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I'd read other Stephen King books before, and found them to be enjoyable, but not with the magnitude of 'IT'. The basic summary is: In the small town of Derry, Maine, in the summer of 1958, 7 children, aged about 11, Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, Eddie, Stan and Mike,discover a horrible secret. The town itself is evil, personified in the form of a clown, It (called Pennywise). The kids attack this demon, and wound it. However, as It works in cycles, It reappears when they are grown and they must beat It once again, this time for good. The charecter developement causes you to fall in love with every person in this book, and feel as if you are there with them. The love that the main charecters feel for each other is so powerful, I had no idea it could be expressed in a book. The ending, when It is defeated is a little odd, but if you allow yourself to simply be absorbed in, it flows very well. The changes between childhood and adulthood are handled with masterful wordcraft. Overall, this book will scare you, make you laugh and cry. I'm sure anyone would love it as much as I do.
B000002MM8|5.0|It is interesting that opinions on this release are so polarised between either highly congratulatory or greatly disappointed. As with any music that exhibits such an individual character, the ingrained likes and dislikes of the individual listener are a larger deciding factor than usual. Many 'rock attuned' listeners prefer the more 'singular' focus of Aion or The Serpents Egg, The Goth/Dark wave set (predicably) err in favour of Dying Sun etc.<br />This is a very eclectic album, when measured against the earlier records. 'Ambitious' is a label that comes to mind, and this can be a dangerous road for a musical artist to tread. On one hand is the possibility of a groundbreaking achievement, on the other extreme, a self-indulgent, flatulent output bogged down in clich&eacute;' despite it's lofty aspirations. (And the middle, the 'interesting failure'- a rather flat-footed achievement.)<br />My opinion, I consider this to be an EXCELLENT album, although this CD took a long time to really grow on me, as it has doubtless done for many others. Ironic that another reviewer voiced a dislike of the 'pop structure' of some of the songs, because this music does not function in the same manner as pop song writing despite that influence. This stuff really needs to be listened to a lot more than once or twice and digested slowly. Like all 'serious' art (an interpretive category, admittedly) the listener only walks away with what they make the effort to invest in the experience. Anyway, lets say SOMETHING about the music.....<br />'Yulunga' - A longish work that creates a somewhat lysergic quality, a slow moving but forceful mood-setter for the album.<br />'Ubiquitous Mr Lovegrove' -  'love song' in a way, though not in the conventional sense. The signature wind melody recalls something of 'Aeon'. Brendan is limited in range as a singer and it is noticeable that his musical arrangements work around this by punctuating his vocal phrasing with dashes of string, flute, percussion and providing well-timed build-ups at key points in his lyrics<br />'Where Soft winds shook the Barley' (traditional)- a cappella piece by Lisa. Rather charming, although easily skipped when one is not in the mood. For attentive listening though, the shaping of the vocal phrases is nicely put together.<br />'The Carnival is over'- A highpoint for me, I love it. The slow delicate arpeggio at the beginning with the build-up of multiple parts is very nicely done, a signature Brendan piece. The same remarks for 'LoveGrove' apply. The lyrics in combination with the music are highly visual and appear rather personal, as though we are being offered a glimpse of a particularly poignant memory.<br />'Ariadne' -  'flows' out of 'Carnival', almost as though they were two separate aspects of the same work. The closing chord of Lovegrove becomes the opening chord of Ariadne and it builds beautifully from there. Lisa's voice works well here too.<br />'Saldek' - A short, simple work with the Arabic and Sepharidic influences coming to the fore. Literally a single chord over and over with Lisa singing on top. Almost for sure a Lisa work. (Interesting how Lisa and Brendan's strengths/weaknesses, are sort of reverse images of each other, Brendan a good composer/arranger if limited singer, and Lisa the great singer/voice sculptor, but minimalist in her writing and musical arrangements)<br />'Toward the within' - simple ingredients overall but the arrangements are highly ingenious and very well thought out.<br />Tell me about the forest - more highly interpretive lyrics and, yet again, well fleshed out arrangements like the way the music functions as a whole yet allows the listener to focus on specific elements without loosing the thread of the work.<br />The spider's stratagem - similar to Towards the Within to a degree.<br />Emmelia - Another strategically placed 'break piece' like Saldek or 'Barley'.<br />How fortunate the man with none -. Builds nicely and lets you down nice and gently at the end. A perfect closer to one of my favourite discs.at the end. A perfect closer to one of my favourite discs.
B00006JIAF|5.0|This CD is one of the best, if not the best I've heard in a long time. The Strokes have a very catchy sound. I've recently attended one of their concerts and can testify to the fact that they sound great live! Allot of bands don't sound anything like their studio version of their music, however the Strokes do. Between their catchy sound and great songs, you can't go wrong!
B00003CXXS|2.0|The dinosaur theme is over...<BR>I'm all for &quot;cash cows&quot; but come on...
B00006LFGD|4.0|First and foremost... Barbra's voice... I noticed in the recent outtakes from the Democratic concert her voice was in incredibly good shape and her new recordings here prove that for whatever reason, Barbra's is in AMAZINGLY good voice lately!<br />The new duets are quite good. The Barry Manilow one is very plesant though I do admit he is just a step above Don Johnson in terms of vocal ability. Still, I think it is very nice that Barbra will record not only with equally qualified voices (Garland, Mathis) but with other vocalists who are interesting, unique or whose sound would actually make a particular song work.<br />The duet with Josh Groban is very exceptional. I am so happy that Barbra experimented with a newer, fresher sound here and she is more than up to the task. I will admit, I'd like to hear Barbra sing something more contemporary and rumor has it that she is already recording a new full length album for release next year.<br />To the one reviewer who bemoaned a lack of new material. Barbra has released albums of entirely new material every two years since &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (1997), &quot;A Love Like Ours&quot; (1999) and &quot;Christmas Memories&quot; (2001) and if this new album is due out next year as planned that will continue the pace. So in fact, when it comes to new material, Barbra's output has been very good and consistent recently. Complaints about rehashing old material would be understandable if this were not her 40 year celebration and Columbia no doubt would prevail upon her for career retrospectives. It was actually 11 years between &quot;A Collection: Greatest Hits &amp; More&quot; in 1989 and &quot;The Essential&quot; set this year, so aside from hearing some of the songs in a concert release, I don't think Barbra is really overdoing it that much.<br />I strongly suspect that after this album, Barbra will be releasing nothing but all new material albums for awhile.<br />It has already been stated that she is planning to record LaraFabian's song &quot;Broken Vow&quot; for her next album.<br />The other songs here are mostly excellent and everyone will have a different favorite depending on the other artists they like. What remains consistent is Barbra's voice and how gracious a duet partner she is... given how powerful a voice she has. <br />For the future... I recommend all-new albums, a more contemporary sound and skipping the duet thing... (and heck, a club remix wouldn't hurt either)... I'd love to hear a remix of her classic song &quot;Promises&quot; from the album &quot;Guilty&quot;.<br />Chris
B00003CXDD|2.0|OK but just can't measure up to the classics...
B00006RU5B|5.0|first things first... this is neither Rage Against the Machine, nor is it Soundgarden... it's even better!  the huge riffs that Morello and company lay down beneath Cornell's crooning and whaling is what will make it one of the best albums of the year.  i now have even more respect for the ex-Rage trio when i hear them slow it down with a mesmerizing jazzy tune as Chris's vocals chill you out... but then comes the fat bass lines and huge guitar licks that we all know so well.  as fans, we get the best of both worlds, what more can you want?  what an amazing debut album... the hype is real... GET IT NOW !!!
B00006LSM3|3.0|Yes, I realize George has passed on and I really want to say nice things about his latest release and him as a person. However, I am writing this review as if it is just another CD from George that needs to get a fair and honest review.<br />That said, this CD is just average. The songs have no real life to them, Gearge vocals are strained and only \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" has the catchy melody that is lacking in the rest of this CD.<br />Some say they are happy that Jeff Lynn did not \\"over produce\\" this. I would say he did not do enough to flesh out the songs.<br />I have every Beatles CD, all the solo CDs from each member of the Beatles and Brainwashed is better than a lot of the solo work but does not even touch \\"All Things Must Pass\\" or even \\"Cloud 9\\".<br />If you want to complete your collection (as I do), by all means buy this CD. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I admit I did not see this film in the theater, and I regret that. But the DVD is great. I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves a good mystery. The movie tantalizes you with directing. And the movie flows so smoothly, that you will not see the surprise ending coming. Truly an engrossing film to watch. There are two types of movies made: Movies to BUY and movies to RENT. This truly is a \\"buy\\" movie.
B0000026KQ|5.0|...but not anymore.  A couple of reviewers called it \\"overproduced.\\"  It's actually not.  One of the nasty music production tricks that came to vogue in the 1990s after everyone got CD players in cars, boomboxes, walkman, etc. was to heavily compress the mix so that it would sound good in your car or on your cheap home stereo.  This CD was not compressed - it's got full dynamic range, and full frequency range.  When listened to on a HIGH QUALITY audio system with full-range speakers, it comes alive!  One reviewer commented that the CD has no bass - he's wrong.  I recently added a pair of Vandersteen subwoofers to my system, and found a tremendous amount of low frequency keyboard work that I had never heard before because my main loudspeakers couldn't reproduce it!  In short, if you think this CD is lacking, or \\"overproduced,\\" it's because your stereo is a cheap piece of junk!  Buy better gear and you'll find that Guitar Shop is a tremendous work.
B00006YXEK|4.0|George Harrison's posthumous album, Brainwashed, reflects the artistes' music style and beliefs.  Consequently, on the whole, it is a very personal album, and will only really be a hit amongst fans of Harrison and the Beatles.  It is well produced by Harrison's son Dhani, and co-Wilbury and close friend Jeff Lynne.  Lynne has a tendency to ELO everything he produces, and there are a few times when this comes up on Brainwashed, but by looking at the number of instruments George himself plays on each track, it is largely a solo album, along the lines of McCartney, Paul NcCartney's first solo LP, that Lynne and Dhani have added extra acoustic guitar, bass and background vocals.  The strings are actually strings, not synthesizers.  As George explains on the accompanying DVD, he recorded the album in the style of the 60's and 70's. \\"It's acoustic guitars, played by people, into microphones, onto tape\\"  That alone should be Harrison's legacy as a recording artist.  That and his honesty and sardonic wit. The songs themselves are very beautiful, poignant graceful, and spiritually pleasing.  <BR>  Listen to Marwa Blues and you imagine yourself on a beacj in Hawaii watching a  sunset.  Never Get Over You is a sweet love song.  Between the Devil and The Deep Blue Sea allows us to hear George \\"at home\\", playing his ukelele.  The uke shows up on many tracks.<BR>  It is good album, but the themes that George writes about have very limited appeal.  He was unique amongst pop stars.
0962477060|5.0|Bill Edwards had me impressed very much with his philosophical thought before I ever read any of his Fretboard Logic series. His approach of appealing to both sides of the brain, as well as the study of human intelligence, learning, and everything else involved in the developing stages of one's guitar playing, plays into this series very well.<br />When I finally decided to give this book a shot, I was still quite skeptical. The reviews seemed impossible, and the elusive yet highly praised simplicity of approach was, at the very least, dubitable. However, I was not disappointed in the end.<br />FL is not a book, unlike the title might suggest, with enourmous amounts of text in really fine print, explaining Platonic origins of music and guitar. Rather, it is an approach to the system around which all of guitar is organized. It made me wonder, in the same way I wonder about chess, whether, whoever it was that invented the now-standard tuning for the guitar, planned out all of the possibilities that guitarists have explored over the years and still continue to explore.<br />The approach of the first two volumes, surprisingly enough, is not very musical. It focuses strictly on the guitar, and the elements which the guitar tuning produces. A patient individual willing to learn the guitar, with no musical background, would benefit the most from this section. It asks you to let go of all preconceptions of what music is, of what guitar playing is, and instead, to focus on the instrument itself, and the possibilities that its uniqueness creates.<br />The second part (volume II) builds on the information acquired in the first part, and re-invents basic musical elements, but approaches them from the standpoint of playing them on guitar! A good analogy of this would be learning language before ever discovering a need to speak it: wouldn't it be great not to have to learn it while having to use it, but rather to have learned it beforehand? Guitar is no more than a tool for musicexpression, and a very well designed one at that - so let us learn the tool first, and then use the tool to create music, without having to think how to apply the tool for the music itself. I find it brilliant.<br />Be forewarned, however: this approach is only for the patient. It is holistic, not reductionist. It's not something that will happen overnight, it is something that needs constant work and dedication. On the bright side of that, very little memorization is required, once some essential elements of music are understood - Mr. Edwards goes through these at the beginning of part II.<br />I also stated that the book is a little repetitive. Perhaps it only seemed that way to me, since I had very significant musical background before taking on this method. It works well to reinforce what has already been shown, and to make sure that the reader understands how what he read before ties into what he will be reading next. It works, and everything is there for a reason.<br />In short, buy this book, learn, and enjoy.

B000069KGM|5.0|Debut albums are always interesting to look back on and listen to after you have collected or listened to that group's later works.  Some debut works are awkward and barely professional, at best.  This is certainly not the case with this album.  Like fine wine, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; seems to get better with time.<br />In it's finest form, this is an album that contains wonderful flowing melds of jazz, pop, and soft rock.  You can tell from the variety of sounds and rhythms in &quot;CTA&quot; that this is a talented and varied group of musicians.  Breaking ground for future bands was not the goal with this album, they instead seemed to be playing for themselves only.  What a concept!<br />For the casual Chicago fan, the classics, &quot;Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is&quot;, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, and &quot;Questions 67 &amp; 68&quot; are readily familiar.  It's satisifying, though, to hear them in their uncut, FM versions.  For the serious fan, other gems are certainly present.  The cover of The Spencer Davis Group's, &quot;I'm a Man&quot;, is in many respects superior to the original.  And the opening (&quot;Introduction&quot;) and closing (&quot;Liberation&quot;) songs tie a wonderful musical bow around a great, great album.<br />Technically, I can only give &quot;CTA&quot;  4 and 1/2 stars because of the annoyingly grating, &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot;.  I know that Terry Kath was a musical genius and &quot;genius&quot; takes many forms, but, in my humble opinion, this song sounds like the microphones were left on as the band was putting away their guitars after a gig.<br />Don't let that minor complaint deter you from getting a copy of one of the best progressive rock albums of all time!  I love what Rhino Records is doing to resurrect the great Chicago albums, but if you can find an original version of &quot;CTA&quot;, grab it right now because the remastered Rhino version just doesn't quite reproduce the album in the clarity that is required of a work of art like this!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!equired of a work of art like this!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00006L9ZT|4.0|First and foremost the question must be asked if you could live with this performance of the Ring on DVD. Most assuredly yes, for though the production is not without its flaws, it is an entertaining evening, or evenings, well spent. Since these are live broadcasts and not studio bound, you will have some vocal frailties come forth. Jerusalem is vocally spent by the third act of Siegfried but admirably holds his own agianst a fresh voiced Behrens. Morris is a noble Wotan and was starting to get the full measure of the role, from the youthful power hungry god in Rheingold to the world weary wanderer in Siegfried. Heinz Zednik and Ekkehard Waschiha play the villinous Mime and Alberic perfectly, Zednik relying less on his usual comic camp than in previous productions. Finally kudos must be given to Matti Salminen who is evil incarnate in the role of Hagan. His black bass and imposing characterization are a pleasure to hear and watch. On the negative there is Jessye Norman who possesses a voice which is simply too powerful for the role of Seglinde. Also her acting ability, along with Gary Lakes as Sigmund, leaves much to be desired...you felt no passion between the two which is essential in understanding their parts. While James Levine does not take the quick tempos of Bohm's justly praised Bayreuth performance, he is not as dull as many believe,and the pacing and drama in the second act of Gotterdammerung is the highlight of this Ring. The costumes (no space suits or tuxedoes here) and sets are not a distraction, and that's a compliment, considering so many produtions rely on visual eye candy to hide other inadequecies in the performance. It was no small fact that many Europeans came to the MET to see this Ring because they were tired of the pseudo new age productions that proliferated in their homelands.<BR>So, since there will not be a truckload of alternate Ring cycle's flooding the market, I suggest you not hesitate in purchasing this fine adaption. Recommended, with minor reservations.

Best songs 1,2,3,4,6,7,12 yes and maybe just all of them. Just buy it, you wont regret it
B00006LSM3|4.0|All things must pass, unfortunately, but George in his last bolw, gives us a fine performance, melodic, very consistent, with his Harrison's guitar tune trademark. <br />Farewell George, your music will remain with us forever, everething else will pass.
B00006CXXU|3.0|When I heard Christina's coming back with a new album, I was worried. Worried that she might have been too late. After all, competitor Britney has spawned three albums, two of which have gone 10X platinum. Christina has proven to be more of a singles artist with 4 #1 hits.<br /><br />Well, better late than never. Christina's first single from here, Dirrty, her pairing with Redman was scorned by radio and the public not for the song but more for the imagery that accompanied the controversial video. Where's our little girl from the Mickey Mouse club. All grown up and not covering up. Gasp! The song plummetted down the charts in not time. But on closer listening, it's a rather funky song with a delicious beat and groove. Christina's performance here is still one with an overused voice, but on Beautiful, the current single, she brings on a surprisingly controlled and emotional delivery that makes the song, well, beautiful! Impressive. Christina should learn to do so more!<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, Christina enlists the help of Pink-collaborator Linda Perry to help here on 4 songs. Christina attempts to show some rock. Fighter, the pseudo-rock song on the album, comes across as a rather flawed attempt at bringing a rock edge to the album though it definitely is friendly for radio. Christina just doesn't deliver the goods here. Famed producer Glen Ballard also lends a hand at making Christina rock!<br /><br />Overall, Christina is much more relaxed and learns to take charge of her wonderful voice.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave is a good band overall but they just lack alot of intensity, among some other things.  I am a huge rage fan but i was never into soundgarden that much and i think Audioslave needs that rage energy that Zack gave.  Tom Morello does alot of cool riffs but most of the songs need speed.  Brads drum beats in my mind seem to be the same through out most of the songs, and Tim dosen't put the cool bass riffs with the wacky sounds in. Cornell needs the faster paced music to sing to because thats the way it sounds best.  overall the music is not bad it just isnt as good as their former bands..
B0000004V2|5.0|It is hard to fully describe the unique, peculiar level of aesthetic beauty and songcraft present on this debut album from the Stone Roses.  This music is melodically and harmonically extraordinary, and as the album winds on and its players dig in, it becomes something even more, a phenomenal blur of psychedelic transcendental magic.     The opener \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" seems to drift out of heaven with its distant rumblings.  As the funky bass line emerges from the noise and the layers of shimmering guitar harmonies cascade over the ominous rhythms, the stage is set for a revelatory musical journey.  After this opening swirl of drama, \\"She Bangs The Drums\\" makes a perfect entry, its endlessly catchy, carefree melody taking the listener to a different world.  And these two songs are but the beginning...     There is rarely a dull or unenlightening moment on any of these 13 masterpieces; even \\"Don't Stop,\\" which is \\"Waterfall\\" played backwards, is strangely interesting, and \\"Elizabeth My Dear,\\" a one-minute interlude set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" is a great political protest.  The album's true shining moment is its conclusion--few albums in recent memory have resolved themselves so well.  The 13-minute firestorm that is \\"This Is The One/I Am The Resurrection\\" is a masterstroke not soon to be replicated by many rocks bands--the triumphant guitars of the former song, which recall the harmonious work of The Byrds, and the sweeping instrumental solos on the latter are as close to pop Valhalla as most bands ever get.    Although this album never went platinum and was basically ignored outside of Britain, it is one of the best releases of the 80s and a watershed within the history of Britpop and proto-shoegazer music.  Some critics continue to downplay its quality and impact, saying that it is simplistic and overly naive, but its charm is elusive and indelible
B00005V3Z4|5.0|As I read the one and two star reviews of this movie, I am amazed at the lack of creative intelligence in this world.  \\"There was no logical conclusion\\",  \\"I dont get it\\" etc. are the usual ramblings by these false prophets. heh heh   No film combines social commentary and conflicting philosophies of life better than this movie.  Why would you expect there to be a neat and tidy resolution?   Has that resolution been made in the real world?  As for the references to other movies like \\"Harvey\\" or \\"Evil Dead\\", OF COURSE HES GOING TO USE ELEMENTS OF THOSE MOVIES.  Like any great artist, he recognized those who have come before him and knows that art builds upon itself.  Where would \\"insert any horror director's name here\\" be without Hitchcock?  This movie is actually just a reverse of Its a Wonderful Life meets Last Temptation of Christ.  Rent this DVD and you will realize you really never die alone.

0066214122|5.0|The factual counterpart to this book is &quot;Our Molecular Future&quot;, that explores the up and downsides of the technologies that underlie Crichton's drama. Read these books together and you'll get a great idea of what may come. On the flip side of Prey are natural phenomena that may be worse, and nanotech that might one day protect us.
B00006LPIV|1.0|I have never written a review before, but I fear I could be held criminally liable if I did not warn anyone about to waste his money or her time on this movie, just as I would be if I knew that there was a bridge out up ahead and failed to warn oncoming traffic. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it makes one wonder whether or not it was made deliberately to goof on viewers and critics.<BR>The plot, if it may be called that, is so creaky that a gallon of Three-in-One couldn't help it. Based on a psychological insight so ham-fisted that even a student in Psyc 101 would giggle, it takes about thirty seconds to determine the basic course of the movie. The main character spends her days brutalizing her students verbally and emotionally while secretly longing--are you ready for the surprise twist--to be physically brutalized in her turn by a lover, within earshot of her harpy of a mother no less. Enter the handsome young man, athlete, engineer, pianist, who is by turns repelled and attracted by the sado-masochistic fantasy, although why is anybody's guess, as one certainly doesn't get much of a clue from his dialogue or his actions. He also utters what has to be one of the funniest lines in the history of cinema during the rape scene, although rape may or may not be the correct word in this context. (And, admittedly, I do not speak French, so had to rely on the subtitles, but I don't think the translators would have gotten that particular line wrong and not any of the others.)<BR>There is one group who will, no doubt, enjoy this film, Francophobes. They will find all of their worst stereotypes of and prejudices about the French resoundly re-affirmed: the snobbery, the pretentiousness, the sexual deviance, etc. About the only one missing is that we never see any of the main characters driving a car.<BR>Someone, I can't remember who, once reviewed a book by saying that it was a book not to be put down lightly, but to be thrown with great force. I think that aptly sums up this film as well.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Many of Streisand's duets have been far more succesful commercially and critically that it is inevitable that one day, she would come up with a duets album, whose concept was first explored by Johnny Mathis in Better Together and of course Frank Sinatra's hugely successful Duets I and II.<br />On a personal note, I have been in love with Barbra's voice since I was 10 years old. As years went by, it has been clear that Barbra's beautiful voice has been a subject of debate. Some say that it is no longer in top form since her 1986 One Voice Concert. Honestly, I never have appreciated her voice during the 60's (blasphemy for her old fans!) and early 70's. I began to have an affair with her voice from 1983 (Yentl) onwards. i feel that her voice has become more powerful and soulful since at this point on her career, she's already a megastar that she has doesn't sound eager to please and just makes and produces albums that she wants and nurtures.<br />Going back, this album has all of her duets plus two new tracks, &quot;I Won't Be the One to Let Go&quot; with Barry Manilow and &quot;All I Know of Love&quot; with Josh Groban. It is noticeable that her voice has become &quot;darker&quot;, and I felt like Streisand was not really completely involved in this project.Strangely, her &quot;Christmas Memories&quot; album last year has her sounding in top form, youthful and magnificent. Ever since her marriage to James Brolin, she has become less visible, makes fewer albums (how I wish she would make another studio album!), and has become lazy in her singing career. Her married life has been a bliss to her but a frustration to us her fans who are extremely thirsty to hear more of her fabled voice.<br />The duet with Barry Manilow is touching and beautiful. Yes, her voice sounds &quot;matured&quot; but that is what the song is all about anyway, about two people who have been together for long who wouldn't let go even if things would go wrong. The duet with Josh Groban is a bit of adissapointment because it indeed does need getting used to. I expected a more straight forward ballad than this &quot;The Prayeresque&quot; duet, Barbra singing in English, Groban in Italian. And of course, there is the customary duet with Bee-Gees, &quot;You Don't Bring Me Flowers&quot; with Neil Diamond, the eye-brow raising duet with Don Johnson (sounding more like a cop than a singer)<br />Over-all this is a good album but with few surprises. Streisand fans surely already have most of these duets, and I don't really notice any major improvement in sound since this is a re-mastered recording.
079284209X|4.0|I can no longer count how many times I have seen this movie.  Instead of becoming bored, I am still just as engaged as when I first saw it.  This is an incredible film.<br />Excitement and intelligence are everywhere.  From the beginning, we are following professionals who plan to steal a package, and from the very beginning we know they are the best. They are working together, but they are wary of sharing too much.  Among the group are a driver, a munitions expert, a computer expert, a procurement man, and DeNiro.  It is never quite stated why he was originally chosen.<br />Robert DeNiro seems to be slow in keeping up with the rest, but then we realize that he is simply meticulous in his work.  The more we watch, the more we realize that he is best of the group.  DeNiro is fabulous in this role.  His intensity here reminds me of his intensity in \\"Heat.\\"<br />I recommend watching this film.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have owned this cd for years and am still astonished. This album recharges my soul.
B00006RU5B|5.0|By 2001, Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine were having issues. After two average albums, Rage seemed to be burned out and then without a frontman. At the same time Chris Cornell hadn't made anything impressive since Soundgarden's Superunknown. So when it was confirmed that the two heavy metal superpowers were working together, fans from both camps hoped for a comeback. No one was expecting this oddest of pairs to create the greatest metal album in years. Enter Audioslave.<br />There are a couple things that make Audioslave's debut magnificent. First off this collaboration actually sounds like a real group. These guys sound unified and determined to make something impressive as one unit.<br />Also, the first thought in the heads of many Soundgarden and Rage fans is whose style would this lean towards. Fortunately these four are able to reach a happy medium between the two very different styles that are brought to the table. Rage has far more bite then Soundgarden ever did, allowing for Chris Cornell to be more intense then ever. (Never has he been more agressive then on Cochise and Show Me How to Live)<br />At the same time, Zack de la Rocha (despite being one of the most powerful frontmen of his generation) was not the most talented of songwrtiers, and certainly could not sing. Rage settles that with one of the finest singers and songwriters of the '90s.<br />On top of all this, both have improved as artists as well. While some songs are duds (Hypnotize) Chris hasn't written lyrics this good since Badmotorfinger. The other members of Rage (particularly Tom Morello) have also reached their peaks as musicians, adding a more subtle nature to their music, using accoustic guitars and a stunning foray of guitar sounds, and adjusting their sound to fit some of Chris's ballads. (I am the Highway, Getaway Car) As the cherry on top the stellar Rick Rubin (one of the best producers ever to grace a rock album) is on board to give this a stellar production.<br />The bottom line is that this isn't Chris's new backing band or Rage Against the Machine with a new mouthpiece. This is Audioslave, a truly new band with a very unique style that is sure to satisfy any headbanger to come across it. Be proud to put this beside Superunknown and Rage Against the Machine, because this one is a winner! Get it now!
B000002MG1|5.0|In 1992 at the height of their popularity, R.E.M delivered their upmost finest, well-crafted project. Automatic For The People was hauntingly atmospheric throughout with the profound lyrics centering on aging, death and loss. Whilst its mood is vastly sombre throughout, the album remains firmly consistently compelling, literally clutching your attention and not letting it go until the album is completed. R.E.M had always been inovators in Rock/Folk music and this merley confirmed their upholding status in their genre. The music on this album has a grand, epic sweep provided by masterful orchestrations containing lush strings, multi acoustic instruments and shimmering keyboards. The album is reflective on the whole and never before had R.E.M been so emotionally direct as on this set. The album opens with the slow, melancholy tone of Drive steadily leading into the vibrant, upbeat Try Not To Breathe, which is a subtle reminder of one of their most definitive classics, Shiny Happy People. The outstanding classic Everybody Hurts is still moving to listen to today and has amicably stood the test of the time as does the entire album. Tracks like Nightswimming and Sweetness Follows have a comforting, soothing tone, very mellow and atmospheric in their unique content. The entire album is instantly memroable with other superb, timeless recordings including Man On The Moon, New Orleans Instrumental No.1, Monty Got A Raw Deal and Ignoreland.<BR>Automatic For The People emrged as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1990's and proved to be one of the key landmarks in R.E.M's profile to date. An essential masterpiece!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie, it was so cute and teaches kids not to afraid of the &quot;boogy man&quot; and certain made up monsters that live under the bed or in the closet.  It's great for kids and the whole family.  Excellent movie!
0375703861|3.0|White Teeth is more a literary romp than a structured novel. It's easy to see why people are dazzled by her prose, but make no mistake, this is a first novel...with a vengeance. <br />Zadie Smith writes engaging dialogue for characters from an impressively diverse set of ages, interests and ethnicities. She can write an interesting riff on just about anything that strikes her fancy and make it fun. Unfortunately, random riffs do not add up to an accomplished novel, although I certainly wouldn't bet against her achieving that in the future. <br />One major problem is that, Smith's writerly voice is so seductive, we get into the habit of accepting her characters' rampant inconsistency. Time and again the reader is lulled into accepting incongruent behavior...only to be baffled later. Particularly unfortunate is Irie's seduction of Magid and Millat the twins who are (well, should be) so pivotal in pounding home the theme of the book. Believe me, I'm not revealing anything here. The average Creative Writing 101 course would label this crucial scene: &quot;unprepared for,&quot; at best.<br />Due to their inconstancy, (Alsana seems to physically morph from a mouse to a mountain without any explanation,) Smith's characters (and eventually the novel itself,) fail to develop in a satisfying way. As the romping begins to resolve itself into some semblance of a traditional structure and Smith needs to start pulling the strands of her novel together, (~last 80 pages) White Teeth loses all momentum. At the end when the author most needs to put weight on her characters observations and beliefs, they are not there for her. The book crumbles to dust in the last chapter...a great pity for she almost pulled off her high wire act despite all the prior analysis.<br />The reader is pulling for Smith all the way to the end which -- I think -- explains all the 5 star reviews. As a first novel it is charming and ambitious but the truth is that it doesn't deliver on the promises made in thefirst chapter. Smith, famously, sold this novel on the strength of that opening volley. She then had to sit down and live up to its promise. The end of the book betrays a writer who is either rushed or exhausted or both. The economics of publishing doubtless demanded the book's publication before it was really ready.<br />As I write this Zadie Smith's 2nd novel has been published to painful reviews and she is reported to be attending Harvard. Nonetheless, she is likely to return to the fray and live up to all the glowing (if premature) tributes in good time. Just reduce expectations when you embark on this book or you will be disappointed by the lack of a payoff in the end.
B00003CY5J|5.0|THE SCORE delivers.  All the ingredients of a fine escape story are here - an impossible technical theft, an exploraton of the minds of heisters, visual tension that is matched by a fine musically scored atmosphere.  Add to this mix the bravado acting talents of Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Angela Bassett, and the amazing Edward Norton and you have a terrific little diversion of a film that is reminiscent of that fine film standard TOPKAPI.<br />The twists and turns of these very real characters keep you on the edge of your seat, and what more can be asked of films of this genre?
B000006NUW|5.0|A well-assembled box set containing just some of Motown's most golden and definitive classics. Nobody knew Motown Records was going to take off in the way it did. Berry Gordy intended to use his artists to break down the then racial barriers, intending to encapsulate a golden and distinct sound that would not only please a black audience but would too appeal to whites. Berry Gordys visions for the company paid off. Key artists like Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder attracted a huge following from both blacks and whites. Seemingly echoing the restrictions of ghetto life in Detroit (which is where Motown began) was the effective, bluesey Money (Thats What I Want) by Barret Strong, Motowns debut release. There is a raw, earthy feel to the classic that has stood the test of time impecably well. There is a strong injection of Rock and Roll on Motowns early releases though they found a more commercially favourable sound with vast elements of pop neatly blended into the production with The Marvelettes famous classic, Please Mr. Postman. The Marvelettes were Motowns premier female group and took the credit of delivering Motown its first chart topper. The Marvelettes didn't have an entirley successful run at Motown. Though they pumped out a sprinkling of fantastic hits eratically through the duration of the decade, their acheivements were pretty limited, probably as they were overshadowed by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas who too admitedly found themselves overshadowed by Motowns biggest act, Diana Ross And The Supremes. Both Martha and the Vandellas and Diana and the Supremes had individual and unique qualities of their own. A vast selection of Martha Reeves finest recordings turn up here from the sassy Come And Get These Memories, the pop masterpiece Heat Wave (though I have to admit I actually prefer Diana Ross' version of it which was featured on The Supremes Sing Holland Dozier Holland album) and the rolling Dancing In The Streets. Just listening to the sheer volume and power of Reeves voice makes you appreciate her often over-looked vocal talents. Diana Ross had a much softer soprano which had soulful qualities, ozzing heavy emotion and genuine feeling that showed subtle hints of a raw vulnreability in her vocal delivery and neatly surfboarded along Motowns complex musical arrangements. Many of their classics are here including the finest of their career with the raw, gritty Love Child and their breathtakingly beautiful ballad, Someday We'll Be Together. Holland Dozier Holland was the main driving force behind a lot of Motowns most golden classics. They wrote and assembled some of the most remarkable pieces of music for both Diana Ross and the fantasic  Four Tops. Lead singer, Levi Stubbs rocketing voice was just amazing and even managed to give you goose bumps. Several of their most famous classics turn up here including their pair of U.S chart toppers, I Can't Help Myself and the hauntingly atmospheric Reach Out I'll Be There. The Temptations were one of Motowns hottest and most versatile acts. The splitting of lead vocal duties between the smooth, sensuous sound of Eddie Kendricks falsetto combined with the explosive volume of David Ruffins more forceful delivery marked an interesting transistion in their work. Tracks like the jamming Get Ready and My Girl respectivley show up on this box set though also highlights some of their most exciting work from the early 70's with the undertones of hot, pulsating funk on Cloud Nine, which saw Dennis Edwards being lead vocalist after the swift departure of David Ruffin and the utterly fantastic classic, Ball Of Confusion, divulging into contemporary social issues.  Smokey Robinson was a key artist at Motown who wrote some timeless music and was generally an all-round and highly versatile entertainer. Some of his most enthralling work is on here such as the infectious sounds of The Tears Of A Clown and the breathtakingly beautiful, The Tracks Of My Tears. StevieWonder was a sheer genius and some of his greatest work is included here, from the masterpiece production of Fingertips to the playful funk of Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours. Marvin Gaye was another one of Motowns definitive artists. His work progresed from the formulaic sounds of Motown on tracks like Stubborn Kind Of Fellow to the masterpiece of I Heard It Through The Grapevine to the profound political statements expressed on the timeless Whats Going On that is deservedly included on here. There is oddly only 1 offering from Diana Ross' solo career with the absolutley magnificent, golden Soul classic, Ain't No Mountin High Enough. Ashford and Simpson always knew how to make good records for Diana Ross and that tracks is one of the many landmarks in her career. You just get goose bumps as that exalting and rip-roaring climax builds and Diana effectivley talks through the verses, emphasising her truly sensual vocal style.<BR>This box set hosts so many classics thats its impossible to chronicle them all but there are some surprisingly rare features on here such as a version of I Can't Give Back The Love I Feel For You by Rita Wright (later covered by Diana Ross on her Surrender album) and some offerings from the over-looked Brenda Holloway. Amongst other familiar classics are the fantastic and the at-the-time controversial nature of Edwin Starr's rip-roaring War, the beautiful This Old Heart Of Mine Is Weak For You by the highly underated The Isley Brothers, the sensational ShotGun by Junior Walker And The All Stars who bought a unique touch of Jazz to their mainstream sound of Soul/R&B/Pop, Needle In A haystack by The Velvettes, ABC by The Jackson 5 (featuring a young, nasal sounding Michael Jackson),Stoned Love by Thr Supremes (possibly their best post-Ross recording featuring Jean Terrell as lead vocalist) and the unforgetable classic, Nowhere To Run by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas. The lists could go on and on and on but the whole box set deserves a thorough listen! Consistently bubbling with red hot, distinct and positivley infectious musical arrangements, Motown opened many doors for black singers and broke down many racial barriers. The golden Motown sound ceased to exist after its headquarters move from Detroit to L.A but all the magic is clearly encapsulated on here. Motown remains a key landmark in the history of black music and also made a significant impact in Pop music all together. Never has there been a record label that has managed to capture and encapsulate such a unique, distinct sound with such a wide range of diverse singing talents. The classics on here are timeless and enthralling. Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection is both superb and timeless but also essential to any serious Soul/R&B collection!
0321127420|3.0|This is the only book I have encountered that describes .NET patterns. This is particularly useful when attempting to gain an understanding of how application architectures differ between .NET and J2EE.<BR>The Java patterns are also very interesting, especially when compared with those described in the J2EE design pattern specific books. Note that this book might best be described as &quot;Enterprise Design Patterns for non J2EE systems&quot;. Some of the patterns can be used to implement DAOs (perhaps for a BMP entity bean). Many others are not really J2EE compliant (eg Identity Map).

B0000683DH|5.0|Ricardo Montelban and William Shatner take this television-episode-at-the-movies over the top with big, fast action and a larger than life plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br />To me, Star Trek was at its best when it asked big questions about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  What would you do?  What would I do?  It never hurt when Trek was modeled after a great WW2 Navy recruiting film, either!  There's just something about shipboard combat that makes the screen come alive in a way other genres can't duplicate. Perhaps it's the sense of ordered chaos, of incredible poise and grace under fire that is the opposite of what we expect.<br />The DVD is a beauty on my big screen projection TV.  I can't wait for the HDTV versions!
0804115613|5.0|This book was fun and creative, even when I was reading it over for the third time.
0805062971|4.0|I was braced for this book by having seen its film adaptation about seven times before I read it, but I can only imagine what reading this book must have felt like for the uninitiated.  Much like the bare-knuckle brawls its characters stage, \\"Fight Club\\" is a no-holds barred look at the nihilism that lurks just beneath the facade of our modern society.  With American culture now obviously placing heavy emphasis on consumerism and status, it's interesting to see what one man thinks it may be breeding.  And I can't think of a better man to deliver the message than Chuck Palahniuk.  As most now know, \\"Fight Club\\" centers around a group of disillusioned young men who pummel each other on a regular basis in order to fight the numbness of living in a superifical society.  And as this and all of Palahniuk's subsequent novels prove, he has a gift for creating both striking sentences and memorable characters.  The most memorable character here, of course, is Tyler Durden.  He's a one-man wrecking crew of sorts, using Fight Club to aim at nothing less than the total destruction of society. In Tyler's view, the world is so far gone that there's nothing left to do but start over.  Countering his extreme pessimism is his alter ego, the narrator, who obviously symphathizes with Tyler's beliefs but can't quite commit to his methods.  The struggle for supremacy between these two personalities forms the crux of the novel, with the fate of American civilization perhaps in the balance.  By the end, the book has gotten a little out of control, but the read getting there is about as compelling and thought-provoking as they come.

B00003CX97|4.0|The Bridge on the River Kwai is a fantastic film account of one man's misguided but honorable attempt to rally his men together in the midst of troubling circumstances.<br />When British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and his men willfully surrender to the Japanese army, they are sent to a prison camp where they must work on an enemy railroad bridge. But Nicholson won't stand for it, eventually having his men do it on his terms. Soon he's virtually running the prison camp, but his misplaced duty has him doing his best work for the enemy.<br />Though at many times it seems ludicrous that a British Colonel would really be so out there that he'd think he was doing a good thing helping the enemy, stranger things have happened. Once you let yourself believe it's possible, the film becomes extremely engrossing, entertaining and splendidly produced. Though it doesn't come close to the masterpiece that director David Lean later created in Lawrence of Arabia, this is still a great film. Guinness as always is wonderful, standing out from the cast as a gifted actor.<br />However, I can't dismiss certain flaws I felt the film had. The sub plot of an American escapee (William Holden) doesn't begin to mesh well with the colonel's story until the second half when he's sent back in with a team on orders to destroy the bridge. Also, the use of Asian women on that team is almost laughable. In the midst of the hot, humid jungle, they're always smiling at the men while serving them. When one was placing mortar shells into a weapon while smiling during combat at the end, she reminded me of the Price is Right girls showing off a prize. Though this depiction of women was standard in film for the time period it was made, it only comes off as silly now.<br />But by and large, this is a wonderful film that easily allows you to overlook these flaws. And worth multiple viewings just for Guinness excellent performance

B00003CXXS|4.0|When \\"Jurassic Park\\" was released in 1993 it became very, very popular all around the world. It made over $900m worldwide and was a top video seller. Yet people still couldn't get enough of the Jurassic Park franchise. In 1997 when the sequal \\"Jurassic Park: The Lost World was released it became the biggest opening weekend of all time, making over $70m in 1997. But unfortunately it didn't make as much money as the original, in fact it made more than $300m less! The reason for this could be that if you've seen it once, you've seen it a thousand times.<br />The first two films were original and had a very well thought out genre. When JP3 (Jurassic Park III) was released I went to go see it. Not alot of people were in the cinema! It seemed like no one was interested. But I was loyal and decided to see it. The beginning was not so great and it didn't give me the FEEL that the first and second film gave me, if you know what I mean.<br />The first two were exciting, scary and adventurous. Its true that Steven Spielberg did not direct this film, but was only the executive producer. I strongly feel that if Steven Spielberg instead of Joe Johnston directed the film it would of been a much more successful film. The film made over $180m domestically and over $350 worldwide. I know that Jurassic Park 4 will be released in 2005 by director Steven Spielberg and I'm sure it will surpass the original by the work of Steven Spielberg because he is the only one that can bring the JP genre back to the top of the charts.<br />JP3 starts off a little dingy but gets a little better during the plane crash and while they're stranded on the island. The new spinasaur dinosaur that they have designed is also a huge improvement. The filosoraptors have also been dramatically improved. I wonder why Same Niel was not included in the 2nd film and why Jeff Goldblum wasn't included in the 3rd film.<br />It is clear that JP4 will be much more successful with both actors in it. Maybe also add Sarah Michelle Gellar, she's got the moves, acting ability and look. The two children from the orginal film should also hopefully star in Jurassic Park 4. I cannot guarantee that you as an individual will enjoy this film. It still has lots of action and fun, but was unfortunately much shorter than the previous two films. In my opinion I suggest that you rent or buy this film over any new releases if you are a Jurassic Park fan!

I can only wish I will be able see life as it goes on without me... very interesting. This book is wonderfully written with all the skill of a fine writer.<BR>I ran to the bookstore to purchase her second book &quot;Lucky&quot; and read that one in two days. A different story line but impacted me in ways I never knew possible..I recommend &quot;Lucky&quot; too!! <BR>I will be waiting in anticipation for the next book.
0066214122|3.0|I have been reading Crichton since I was about 14 years old and have considered him one of my favorite writers of all time. His stories always appeal to me and I never want to put the book done once I start. Prey was no different but there was many things that did alter my judgement of the book. For one the story taking place during the course of a day (more or less)seemed to both enhance the evolution of the nanoparticles as well as giving the audience the feel of a rush. In my opinion I think it was rushed to much and it gave that feeling of unrealistic. The end, as well, in my opinion, without giving too much details, was horribly rushed and could have been written for a little bit more suspense. Also the added extras that made no sense...the continual noting of the sprinklers, car crash (essential to a degree but could have been done differently), etc, could have been used to, again, enhance the suspense of the reading. Overall the book was good, I would suggest it but not Crichton's best.

B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's posthumous solo offering is, for a lack of a better word, brilliant. While 'All Things Must Pass' was a flawed masterpiece with some filler material, Brainwashed is focused, melodic and soulful. Every single track on this one is a classic and George's guitar never sounded any better. I would dare say that there are no standout tracks on this one and your favourite tracks will depend on your present mood. My complaints? Well Dhani, you could have come up with a better cover - it sorta reminds me of some Radiohead album. Even so, the sleeve with is linear notes is pretty well done. Brainwashed comes in many flavours but I'd suggest you don't bother with the DVD pack 'cause its only a few minutes long. Still, it makes a nifty collectors item with the guitar pick and all. <br />Like all great albums, this one isn't getting much airplay on the local radio stations here in Singapore, nor is it doing well on the charts but what would you expect from a generation which hails KoRn as the best thing to happen to rock music since The Beatles? For the rest of us who still LISTEN to music, Brainwashed comes with the highest recommendations.  <br />What more can I say? Amazing production and excellent tracks, featuring some of the best slide guitar you've ever heard. Listen to Marwa Blues when you're feeling down, if it doesn't make your eyes swell, nothing will.
B00003CXFV|2.0|Despite its terrific performances and excellent pacing, \\"Erin Brockovich\\" proves most of all that no matter how trashy, foul-mouthed or self-absorbed a good-looking white woman is, she will always come out on top, especially if she stays abreast of her personal responsibilities. Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility. Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault. After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility. The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a \\"common\\" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior. For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around. Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible. And she expects a big check in the end from the very lawyers whose ethics she repeatedly condemns. What does that make her? I just don't buy into the cockeyed moral center of the movie, no matter how much gritty charm Roberts brings to the role. Ultimately, of course, Brockovich triumphs, but the movie makes it clear that it's her sexuality that open doors for her and not much else. True to life? Probably. But so is cancer. Doesn't mean I want it or need to see it.
B000069CWE|5.0|damn, alright at first i thought that this album would blow, i mean how can you take something as awesome as hybrid theroy and remix all the tracks with hip hop.  i didnt buy or even listen to any of the tracks until about 2 weeks ago, and the album has stayed in my cd player ever since.  if there was a radio station that played this kind of music all the time i would never change my dial.  its kinda a techno/rap/rock dj super mix, and i love it.  if you like music youll like this

B00000K19E|5.0|I purchased a DVD player specifically because I wanted to own this movie on DVD and I wasn't disapointed. It has a great plot, visually stunning. While arguements could be made about the acting, quite honestly, who cares. The story is so interesting and the movie is so exciting I have watched it numerous times. I look forward to watching it with friends that have never seen it before. And the sound..... if you have a surround sound system you'll be blown away.

0060523794|2.0|If you are looking for a condensed version of IBM highlights under Gerstner's lead, this book will meet your needs.  If you are interested in gaining an understanding of IBM's issues that led to the &quot;elephant&quot; stumbling, and Gerstner's solutions, you will be disappointed.<br />&quot;Who says...&quot; is a quick read with a superficial treatment of the various issues facing IBM and a simplified view into Gerstner's techniques to turn the company around.  Many different scenarios are rushed through, leaving the reader wanting to know more about how and why.  The solutions offered by Gerstner and his team seem pat--surely there was more going on.<br />Gerstner can not answer all his critics or the legion of angry ex-IBM'ers in a single book, particularly so close to his career transition. Unfortunately, this book misses the opportunity to provide the reader with anything more than a superficial insight into one man's view of IBM.
B000001EGE|5.0|In 1972, Elton John scored his first number one album with Honky Chateau, recorded at France's famed recording studio, Chateau d'Hierouville. The album hit the top spot on the strength of its 2 hit singles, Honky Cat and Rocket Man. But the album goes beyond those two classics and reveals some hidden gems. The lost innocence of the beautiful Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters is heartfelt. It's a classic Elton tune, and it found new life when Elton sang it at The Concert For New York in October of 2001. After that, he performed at every show he did. The rockers Hercules and Amy both pay tribute the classic '50s' rock sound Elton grew up on. The steamy, slow and provocative feel of Slave is Elton's emotionally-driven best. Mellow is another midtempo song, done with Elton's trademark style. Suzie(Dramas) is another midtempo song, with nice piano from Elton. And I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself is a nice look at Bernie Taupin's dark side. The album is also the first to feature Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray and Davey Johnstone as full-time band members. All three had played on Madman Across The Water but Johnstone only played on three tracks, and Olsson and Murray played on just one, though<br />they sang backup vocals on Tiny Dancer. On songs like Rocket Man and Slave, Murray steals the show with some fine bass playing, and Olsson's drum playing steals the show on several tracks. This is a must-own for any fan of Elton John.
B00005YUNY|5.0|yes has completely outdone themselves on this dvd.  i own all of their previous vhs and dvd releases including abwh and this is by far the best.  the group is in top playing form and tackle some of their more ambitious compositions with an orchestra that is primed and game for the show.  tom brislin's keyboard playing appears effortless and flawless as well as integrated ( he also sings well and plays percussion in the show ).  and what can be said of the band that has blessed our ears for over three decades?  thank you!!  the european festival orchestra under the direction of wilhelm keitel deserves the repeated standing ovations along with yes.  the ritual has never sounded this good.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I really liked this album.  I reccommend for anyone who appreciates good talent.  I was a little concerned at first.  I thought is might be some poppy I'm grown up, I ain't no kid, look at me half naked bull... but I'm glad to say I was wrong.  Christina put her foot in this album and it istruly superb.  My favorite songs are Infatuation, Impossible, Beautiful... Pretty much don't have a complaint about any of them.  This is grade A work.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is one of the very best soundtracks I haveever heard! Howard Shore has done a spectacular job of composing, orchastrating and conducting this marvellous CD.<BR>Every track is just as it should be, mixing the music of Tolkien's Middle-Earth with the beautiful landscapes that are seen in nearly every shot of the film. The soundtrack opens up with 'The Prophecy', a very good, darker toned piece that opens the album off right. We then go into a delightful piece that just makes you think of hobbits. 'Concerning Hobbits' is surely one of the soundtracks best songs and makes for a wonderful listening experience. The third track is 'The Shadow Of The Past', another dark, well-written piece that fits perfectly into the blend.<BR>The next four songs, 'The Treason Of Isengard' 'The Black Rider' <BR>At The Sign of the Prancing Pony' and 'A Knife In The Dark' are of a darker tone so as to flow along in the movie with the scenes of the Nazgul, or Ringwraiths. 'A Knife In the Dark' ends spectacularly with a beautiful elven voice out of the darkness and overcoming the evil chants of the Nazgul.<BR>The next track, 'Flight To The Ford', opens up very much the same way as the previous track ended, with elvish music.<BR>The track plays throughout the scene of Arwen rushing Frodo into Rivendell with the Black Riders at thier tail.<BR>The Next track, 'Many Meetings' is a welcome departure from the darker tone of the prior six or seven tracks. It takes place in the elven city, Rivendell and works great for the scene.<BR>'The Council Of Elrond' the next track and surely one of the best,<BR>features Enya's first of two songs, 'Aniron' shown during the scene between Aragorn and Arwen is marvelous, soaring to just the right heights in every verse. A wonderfully written and sung track. 'The Ring Goes South' follows the Fellowship as it leaves Rivendell. 'A Journey In The Dark' has the Fellowship entering The Mines Of Moria. The darker theme here is extraordinary and put to even greater use in the following track, 'The Bridge Of Khazad Dum', very possibly the best piece in the soundtrack.<BR>It ends tragically in the movie and emotion bleeds through the song in the last minute. Breathtaking. The fourteenth track is 'Lothlorien'. the danger here is that it would have been very easy to use the same basic theme used for Rivendell in 'Many Meetings' and 'The Council Of Elrond'. Howard Shore does a spectacular job of avoiding this by creating a different elvish theme and it is put to great use. The following track is 'The Great River' and includes 'Lament For Gandalf' which is quite exceptional in itself. 'Amon Hen', the sixteenth track is filled with the wonder and awe at the sight of the Pillars Of Argonath and is a great track. The last film score featured is 'The Breaking Of The Fellowship' and includes 'In Dreams'. All and all a marvelous piece that ends the movie wonderfully. The last track on the album is Enya's 'May It Be'. No doubt you have heard this one, but regardless of all the airtime it is a terrific song, one that should have won for Best Original Song at the Academy Awards this past year. Also is a marvelous ending for an even more marvelous album. I doubt that you can find a much better soundtrack than this one and I consider it one of the best in my collection.

B00007E8V4|5.0|I was so excited when I heard that System was coming out with a a new album. First off, these songs WERE NOT rejects, as Daron (the guitarist) said basically, there was so much melodic-ness on Toxicity that they couldn't put a lot more melodic songs on their CD. So the outtakes were kept safe and sound, until somehow all the songs leaked onto the internet and then they decided to come out with \\"Steal This Album\\"...kind of... <BR>It's an amazing album, the only drawback being the songs are all really short, the longest only about 4 minutes. Some of the best songs include:<BR>Bubbles, Nu Guns,A.D.D., Mr. Jack, I-E-A-I-A-I-O and Roulette just to name a few. Buy this CD if your a System Of A Down fan!!
0767805712|3.0|Discrimination, nature-vs.-nuture, potential, drive... all fascinating issues, and all touched upon by Gattaca.<br />But when paired with a 'stylishly soulless' execution, the issues become as dull and lifeless as the characters that portray them.<br />In the film, love fizzles rather than sizzles.  Passion seems hardly passionate.  The main character has drive, but it's one more exposited than shone.<br />All of this together makes one think \\"hmm\\" rather than \\"wow!\\"  While this may be a \\"thinking man's movie\\" it succeeds only in suggesting broad themes to contemplate rather than coloring, twisting, accentuating, and tweaking aspects of the themes to get us to take the next step.<br />And on a more superficial but no less frustrating level, I found it questionable that a firm like Gattaca would require DNA testing -- whether for identity or drug-free status verification -- on such a frequent basis.  With entrance into the facility already tightly controlled, what threat (post-murder environment aside) was so imminent that justified such a thwart in daily productivity?<br />SPOILER!!!<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />And lastly, with regards to the murder... surely, some of the murderer's stature and access could have employed a much less blunt method of killing, no?  Poisoning, sniper rifle (via hitman), etc... all would have resulted in less risk of ultimate detection.<br />In a nutshell, then, Gattaca -- despite its noble trajectory -- is brought down by implausibility and a failure to examine critical issues raised in a more bold and deep manner.
B00005JK8K|4.0|This was a good movie, a little gorey. It was good to see Indians in a movie where they were not being hunted by cowboys. There is a lot of action, and what happens if you just follow orders and don't use your own head to save yourself and your troops. It is also about learning about yourself and courage. There is also a man that learns that rasism is wrong and grows up.

0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is a story created around the murder of a young girl, Susie Salmon. Susie serves as the omniscient narrator in heaven after her murder and from her view the reader is opened into the many different lives of her family and friends as they grow and change from her death. Through Sebold's use of characters, she creates a beautiful and interesting novel. Each character holds a special tie with Susie and through their past relationships we are able to see a part of them, but more importantly a glimpse of Susie. The reader is given the opportunity to observe the past, yet still follow the present. Although Sebold's use of characters lies as the most dominate device used in her work, she also cleverly weaves in some foreshadowing. She cunningly leaves the reader in suspense as they remain immersed in her book. Through Sebold's simple style and the interesting point of view the story is told, we are clearly able to see Sebold's message of life after death. I feel I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it contained every motion. There were times of joy, sorrow, love, and sympathy. These mixed emotions make it an enjoyable read that would entertain a variety of audiences.
B00005K9LN|5.0|By the second listen, British Steel had become one of my favorite Priest albums. This can be attributed to the change in style. British Steel is simplified musicly and lyricly it is basicly a party record celebrating themes like being Metal Gods, Breaking the Law, and Living After Midnight. Rapid Fire is a brilliant opener and has to be the most under-rated song here. Grinder and Steeler are fun songs. You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise is catchy also. With Priest, you can become divided on what phases in their career you favor, from the technical artistry of the 1970s to the arena headliners of the 1980s to the glam Turbo and the ultra-heavy Painkiller, and new Judas Priest. British Steel sounds dated, but it still rules.

B00005JKCH|4.0|Having never gotten the chance to see this film in its theatrical release, I was a little weary about popping the DVD into the machine.  I feared it would be heavy on special effects, short on plot, and about as entertaining as watching computerized graphics.  Happily, I was wrong. This film was actually very engaging, and close enough to the comic book origin to please fans of the Marvel character.  <br />Each of the actors is well-cast, though I always thought Aunt Mae was supposed to be much more frail than this. Still, probably the most enjoyable comic book movie since the 1989 &quot;Batman,&quot; and probably the best overall story since the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film. Special effects actually enhance the story rather than get in the way.  And Dafoe plays the Green Goblin convincingly.<br />The DVD extras are so-so.  I guess for archival purposes, it's nice to have so many of the TV commercials for the movie.  But the history of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; segments are a little unfulfilling at times, especially the one that allows you to look at the character in each of its decades.  Not all covers are included, and for whatever reason, the entire new costume fiasco of the early 90s isn't even addressed.  And the Activision games are really only demos, and I can't get them to work on my computer at all.<BR>If it were just the movie, I'd give this five-stars. The unfulfilling special features knock it down a star.

B00005UEAR|3.0|Before I go further, I have to confirm that I am a huge Dream Theater fan, I own all of their previous albums (aside from Change Of Seasons) and I consider them to be some of the most talented musicians ever. How they found each other in the first place is almost as incredible as their music itself. However, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance has failed to impress me. This isn't because it is a radical change in direction but because it embodies every single criticism that has ever been thrown at the band before.<br />Mechanical. Souless. No emotion. I have looked at these criticisms and passed them off as being said by narrow-minded people with no patience. But here, I can see where they are coming from. The problem is that most of the music here is simply not memorable. I know that this band do not release the sort of albums that totally grap you the first time you hear them, but I do think that after hearing the title track all the way through 3 or 4 times (not to mention the countless other times that I've listened to bits of it) I should have least some urge to listen to a least one bit again. But I don't - in fact every time I've put it on its because I'm trying to force-feed it to myself. Dream Theater seemed to have crossed the line of taste. Maybe it was simply that the title track (covering the entire second CD) is the most ambitious thing they've ever done and they've almost overestimated themselves. But most probably it was because of the enormity of the music on the second CD that the technicality was concentrated on so heavily that the emotion was missed out. There is something else as well - I can't put my finger on it but there is something missing - an edge perhaps.<br />Contrast the epic title track with the individual songs on the first CD. These fare much better and in terms of their nature the are the Dream Theater I know and love. This isn't because they are particularly different in style from the title track, but because they have that edge. Even then though they are not perfect. Misunderstood could have ended way before it did - it just went on and on and on. But still, the first CD is still great. It is disappointing for me - if the two CDs had been released separately in the form of EPs or something then it would probably have been better as each CD could have been appreciated for what it was. My favourite here would be the opener The Glass Prison - perhaps the heaviest song the band have ever done.<br />In conclusion, this is a mixed bag. Some great music, but also some technically impressive but unmemorable music as well. For those of you new to Dream Theater I recommend Images And Words, their best CD to date in my opinion. Also check out Awake and Metropolis Part 2:Scenes From A Memory.n then though they are not perfect. Misunderstood could have ended way before it did - it just went on and on and on.

0380820846|5.0|I read this book not once, but twice.  I was intrigued by Colin's wanderlust as it was made mention from the very beginning with The Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, and An Offer from a Gentleman.  Although it is made mention in all these books of his wanderlust, he was always coming from some place, it sometimes showed his temper and, gentle readers, we always knew he was somewhat of a prankster and all around &quot;charming&quot; man.  The book pretty much leaves out his goings on for over 10 years...I wonder what made him become the man he is in the book.  However, I know you can't pack all that into a single book.  To me, the book catchs up with him as he finally is settling and it seems to shock him that what he needed was right under his nose.  I'm also very happy that Penelope became the heroine in this book.  I did so like her after I read The Viscount Who Loved Me.  The bringing of them together, who had already been introduced to us before, seemed like the icing on the cake.  <br />I can't wait for the next installment on the Bridgertons.  Where did Eloise go on the night of the ball????  I await was baited breath for that one.  <br />If you have not read all the books in this series, you are truly missing a treat.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Of all the movies I have seen, which is quite a few, this one is definitely in my top five movies of all time. It is like no movie I've seen before, no matter how intersesting they may be. It is very rich in symbolism and philosophy, two aspects that make this movie very very unique. An excellent storyline that may interest you to the point where you have to see it numerous times! I'm sure once you see it, you will not be dissappointed, no matter your preferences in movies! Full Five stars!!!
B00006V9A0|5.0|For any Nirvana fan, this album is worth the price of admission just to hear the song \\"You Know You're Right\\".  For the beginning Nirvana fan, this album is a great place to start!  It contains most all of their songs that were ever heard on the air- essentially a greatest hits compilation.  <br />I'm sorry so many Nirvana \\"fans\\" are so [mad] that it doesn't contain unreleased tracks like \\"Spank Thru\\", \\"Blandest\\", or \\"Pen Cap Chew\\" or reasonably hard to find songs like \\"Marigold\\", \\"Even in His Youth\\", or \\"Happy\\".  I'm sorry, but the songs just are not on it.  I've gotten over it, so can you.  Trust me...  It's your choice whether or not to spend your money on this CD.  <br />Whether or not this CD has all the Nirvana songs a true fan would like to see, it absolutely cannot be denied what a strong set this is.  This disc is a compilation set and a fine one at that.  I highly recommend it!<br />Now, let's see the remastered Bleach and a collection of rarities and outtakes.
B00006RU5B|5.0|From the raw vocals to the meat of the music, this one doesn't stop.  Working at a music store, all I have to do is throw this album in and get the registers ready.  Every song can hold it's own and were arranged perfectly ; everything you would expect from a merger of two rock powerhouses.  If you don't own it already, your collection is less than complete.  The moment they post a date near you, run - don't walk - to the nearest outlet &amp; GO!
B00005CDNK|5.0|This album (their last album) released in 1981 was truly the best work ABBA ever did. It was a drastic change from the purely pop context that made them famous, but nevertheless a natural progression since the divorce of the group's last remaining couple before the making of this album. &quot;The Visitors&quot; is the ultimate example of their progression from their first, relatively lightweight &quot;Ring Ring&quot; album in 1973. Unfortunately the record didn't do as good as their previous - it was way ahead of it's time and ABBA were no longer progressing with the mainstream, but going into a much higher direction. (though the album did reach #1 in UK for a little while - the singles from this album didn't chart as well in the UK or internationally). The sound on this record (and the singles that followed) weren't completely within the synth pop sound of the early eighties. Although as time has told, this record has held up much better compared to many of the other, more popular records of the time. <br />ABBA's records will always remain classics, but compared to the rest of their catalogue, the progressive sound and poignancy of this one has no comparison. The lyrics have a depth that is sometimes haunting and yet still keeping within the trademark melodic arrangements they were famous for. Agnetha and Frida's vocals were higlighted as never before by the digital effects and emotion in the music. <br />People don't usually think or talk about this album when mentioning essential ABBA recordings. It just goes to show how this album is a forgotten, underrated masterpiece - from the amazing cover to the outstanding music. I first heard this album over seven years ago and it still hasn't worn on me. Timeless, distinctive work like this stands out in any context. An essential ABBA album.
B000002UAF|1.0|this was the boys who covered the american rhythm and blues in the 60s? they admired elvis and wanted to be him.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This cd is extremely odd to listen to at first, especially for hardcore fans of System's power ballad songs like Arials, ATWA, Spiders, parts of Chop Suey, etc. The first time I heard the cd I was quite honestly disappointed. The next day, however, I decided to listen to it again and I loved it! The album is very uptempo and contains many valuable political insights. Among the best songs on the cd are Chic 'n' Stu, Innervision, Boom!, Mr. Jack, I-E-A-I-A-I-O (or something like that), Highway Song, Egobrain, and Roulette, all of the tracks are worth hearing for sure. I encourage you to support the least mainstream album from System of a Down yet!
B00005J6T1|5.0|All right, so maybe if you listen to this and then RAY OF LIGHT this album may seem like nothing except a little piece of pop fluff, but I recommend you look past that. This album contains some of Madonna's greatest work, such as &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, the latter 3 she wrote herself. Take it from someone who owns the original CD of this album, the remastering of these tracks is such a great breath of fresh air for them. Madonna's confidence, style, and great sense-of-self radiate through this album and are a great sign of what was to come. Sure, she may be at her best right now, but don't be afraid to pay a visit to Madonna of 1983. It really shows you how talented she has always been, as well as how wonderfully she has progressed and developed over time. This album is essential to your CD collection, order it as soon as you can, there will be no regrets, I guarantee it.
0743424425|5.0|The first movie version is just as eerie as the book (I would recommend it! Director- Stanley Kubrick).  I liked the book because it had interesting characters and an exciting plot.  Wendy came about to me as being nieve and lost but her nievette complimented the Outlook's gruesomeness.  Although I liked her because of that reason best, and also she seemed like someone I'd like to meet, charming.  Danny was my window to the book because I felt as if I related best with him, although his mother captured more of my sympathy.  And Jack I couldn't decide what to think of, Wendy just made it MORE confusing by the ambigious way she treated him.  I must say that NOW when it snows I feel as if it's slightly evil, quitely blanketing the earth.  But it's a nice afterthought of the book, an impression it has left on me. (Many chapters beging with the snow quietly falling).   Those who haven't read it will be mystified by the scene of the ball-room while the 'Beautiful Blue Danube&quot; plays on in the background.  Also, those who enjoy the world war era's rich guy's lifestyle will by captivited by the book's haunting depiction of it in some chapters.  A perfect combo of past with romantic eerieness THE SHINING is bound to shine on you.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth's albums have progressed greatly from Orchid to Deliverance.  This album put elements that made Blackwater Park so successful and took most songs a step harder.  This is definitely one of Opeth's hardest albums, deserving the 5 star rating because of their musical flexibility and their evolution of the melodic aspect of metal.  I have the greatest respect for Opeth in their softer songs, which I tend to see as much more melodic.  'A Fair Judgement' is the track I enjoyed in that sense on this CD.  Opeth definitely took their harder songs to a higher level on this one and the results were great.  It's hard for me personally to compare this to any other Opeth album (I dont know why), but it still deserves its 5 star rating that I gave it.  Opeth fans: Buy this one! You won't be dissapointed.  People newer to Opeth: This is an excellent one, but maybe not the best example of Opeth.  Regardless, BUY IT!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Towards the back of the reviews there are a load of whiners complaining that this isn't \\"Toxicity.\\"  It's not supposed to be.  If you weren't apart of the yuppie pop groupies who hopped on the SOAD bus when \\"Toxicity\\" came out, you would know the roots of SOAD and how unique they really want to sound.  <br />Pick up this CD and the first one to get your reality check.  \\"Toxicity\\" was also a great CD, it just created problems with all the pop groupies thinking they are rock fans cause they enjoy \\"Chop Suey.\\"<br />\\"Steal This Album\\" is the best release yet combining all of what is unique about SOAD.  The only time this cd sees the light of day is when its being switched from the car cd player the stereo system.<br />-Kresh
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has the prettiest voice on earth!! I've had this cd for a few months now and i have been able to listne to it over and over again-without getting sick of it!... i wish he'd come out with another cd cuz i'd probably love it even more!... WOOOOOO GO JOHN!... PRETTY VOICE!...
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Another great compilation, but very disappointed that the 'hit' version of &quot;BIG LOVE&quot; is not included and would have rather had the versions of &quot;LANDSLIDE&quot; &amp; &quot;SILVER SPRINGS&quot; from the 1997 album &quot;The Dance&quot;. Both had a lot of airplay, yet were passed over for their 70's versions.<br />The songs that are here are excellent though. Very pleasantly surprised about the different mixes of &quot;OVER MY HEAD&quot;, &quot;RHIANNON&quot; &amp; the great but often overlooked &quot;SISTERS OF THE MOON&quot;.
B00005YT8U|5.0|After listening to this CD, I was simply blown away by the quality and range of music.  This is my first Chieftains CD (just heard about them) and am simply amazed by the quailty of the songs and the performances.  The CD is a keeper.
0060229357|5.0|As a very young child, we would go to the school library, I found Harold and the Purple Crayon. This is the greatest book from my early childhood. I used to trace the pictures, then drew my own pictures. I am now an artist working at a graphics company, and I enjoy astronomy (due to the moon that followed me too!),  I recently bought a new hardcopy of the book for myself just because this is one of the most memorable books from my childhood, my original copy was pretty worn out. Give it to a young person in your life and watch their imagination grow!

B00005JKCH|4.0|\\"Spiderman\\"-  a film eighteen years in arriving according to the director's commentary - is worth waiting for. Rather than give a long-winded, hard to follow review, I'll keep to the highlights -<br />Just perfect:<br />1) The movie itself. Director Sam Raimi (of \\"Evil Dead\\", \\"A Simple Plan\\",  \\"Darkman\\", \\"Xena\\", and \\"Hercules\\" fame) nails the film dead-on. The look and feel of the settings, the choices of shots, the comic book feel, and editing are top notch. He manages to draw out the best in the characters and the actors who play them. As is noted several times in the commentary tracks, Raimi chose characterizations over action, and I believe that is what separates \\"Spiderman\\" from so many other films in the Action genre. The characters are real and people you can identify with.<br />2) Casting and acting. Fans groaned at some of the casting choices, but the actors were perfect. Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is magnificent, capturing the difficult inner conflicts of the character. The final scene in which his inner dialog plays out perfectly matches the subtle expression changes on his face. Kirsten Dunst was a concern for me as Mary Jane, but brought a lively interpretation to the role. Willem Dafoe looks like a villain, even without a mask, but still was warm when his character was meant to be sympathetic. J.K. Simmons was born to be J. Jonah Jameson, the gruff newspaper head. And Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were spot on perfect as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Simply wonderful casting.<br />3) The DVD. It's crisp and lively with a host of additional features. In particular were pop-up balloons that would give info during the film, two commentary tracks - one from the directing team and one from the visual effects team, background on the Spiderman comic book (villains, loves, etc.), and some outtakes and screen tests. My only disappointment in the screen tests was the lack of tests that featured actors who didn't get the parts. That you never see this anyway - must be a contractual thing - on other discs doesn't make this lack unusual, only missed.<br />4) Sound. The DVD's sound options were pleasantly distinct. The dialog boost option worked wonderfully, much better than on some other DVDs I've seen.<br />5) Faithfulness to the source. Best of all, the movie itself is true to the comic. They felt little need to mess around with the history of Spiderman. There are a few modifications, but they are unobtrusive and make sense. Thank you for not screwing Spiderman fans!<br />Mixed:<br />1) Spotty visual effects. Some of the CG effects looked like CG effects. The run across the rooftops was stilted. Others were brilliant. Case in point, the battle scene in the burning apartment. The commentary by the visual effects team noted that the CG of Spiderman avoiding weapons thrown by the Green Goblin fooled everyone, even other effects team members. Additionally, the commentary noted hundreds of spots where CG work was used that went completely unnoticed by me and certainly other viewers. That these were so seamless speaks well of the effects crew. Now if other parts can only be fixed up for the next film....<br />2) Deleted scenes. The visual effects team made note of hundreds of effects and scenes that were left on the cutting room floor. However, the DVD lacks a set of deleted scenes. In particular it was noted that the final confrontation was cut down considerably. It would have been nice to see those scenes. I guess they are being held for a box set once the series has run its course.<br />Poor:<br />1) DVD navigation. It's remarkably poor. Tiny glowing lights highlighted sections of the navigation. On some TVs they might be impossible to see. Too subtle to be helpful. You might think you got stuck in a section of features, but the system is working. Several people told me they had problems with the subtle changes in the navigation, too.<br />All in all, one of the best superhero movies (and accompanying DVDs) to hit the marketsince \\"Superman II\\". Definitely worth the cost to buy if you are a fan of action and superheroes.t since \\"Superman II\\". Definitely worth the cost to buy if you are a fan of action and superheroes.
0767817478|4.0|This movie is a hoot.  Anyone who claims it takes away from the original needs to have their head examined.<br />The japanese Godzilla movies are just plain awful.  Even the camp was bad.<br />This movie is all around silly fun action with some pretty good special effects and a great send up of lots of action/monster movies of the past.<br />Granted the Godzilla monster needed to be more cumbersome (actuallly the baby zillas were better proportioned).  <br />The cast performs well and has fairly good comedic timing and the movie keeps rolling with little if any dead air.<br />This is no English Patient (now that was a dull boring lifeless film), nor is it Gone with the Wind.  But it is not supposed to be.<br />Frankly it is better than Episode 1.  <br />Yes it is not the man in rubber suit and cheap polystyrene buildings of the Japanese Godzilla films (thank God) but frankly no Japanese Godzilla was ever worthy of adoration.<br />It is a reinterpratation of shlock movies and as such it is leaps and bounds better than what it is based on.<br />Make sure you bring lots of popcorn and check your brain and hangups at the door.

B0000039QA|5.0|I enjoy this album and when I mean I enjoy trhis album, it's been five years since Biggie was taken away from us real rap fans that grew up listening to his flow and lyrics and still today this album can not be touched by any other rapper out there which is why it still has high rotation on my stero and jeep. Biggie came so explosive from the Intro and into the Outro. Biggie even visioned his own demises on this album. Biggie was a visionary and this album helped Biggie become the first ever complete rapper in the rap music. I can now say I have heard the best and the best is on \\"Life After Death.\\"
B00006X06U|3.0|The difference between perfectionism and meticulousness is that those indulging in the latter can all too easily lose sight of the former, that they become so absorbed in the detail that the full and potentially perfect picture suffers from a lack of overall pespective, that the whole is compromised by the parts. When the picture, furthermore, is as extravagant as that created on Joni Mitchell's 2-CD, 22-track 'Travelogue' there are more than enough parts to distract even the most incorrigible of perfectionists. Following the release in 2000 of Mitchell's excellent standards album, 'Both Sides Now', and the sublime renditions thereon of both the title track and 'A Case of You', I, like many long-standing admirers of Mitchell's work, had hoped for an orchestrated best-of-Joni-Mitchell album, a selection of her finest songs rendered equally exquisite by the same application of inspiration, dedication and artistry, the same disciplined perfectionism, indeed, as opposed to the somewhat indulgent meticulousness that has produced here a good album where there could have been a great one. As was ever the case with double albums, we have in 'Travelogue' an example of quantity rather than quality. Had the same time and trouble been applied to half as many songs this would surely have been a truly superb collection. As it is, all too few of these songs have been improved by their orchestrated revision while others, moreover, were simply never tailored for such treatment. The songs from the still excellent 1976 album, 'Hejira'('Amelia', 'Refuge of the Roads' and 'Hejira' itself) are but limp representations of the originals while both 'Woodstock' and 'The Last Time I Saw Richard' were done greater justice in their live renditions on 'Shadows and Light' and 'Miles of Aisles' respectively. One fears that Joni has, on 'Travelogue' deluded herself into believing that far more of her consistantly great songs are standards than are actually able to become so. They are indeed great songs, penned and performed by an inspired artist whom I, for one, would hotly and unhesitantly defend as the greatest singer-songwriter in the history of popular music. But I emphasize the duality in the term &quot;singer-songwriter&quot;. Precious few exceptions aside, her songs are best sung by her alone. As no-one else will ever do more than a handful of them justice (the generally splendid Diana Krall's awful recent cover of 'A Case of You' being a case in point), they will never become standards. This is, inevitably, a good album; for Mitchell is incapable of making a bad one (and, no, I have not forgotten 'Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'), but a more discriminating selection of those of her songs that truly have the potential to be great regardless of who sings them would have been altogether more rewarding for both Joni and her rightly devoted admirers. As she might herself have said: No-one ever asked Van Gogh to repaint 'A Starry Night', and nor would anyone else wisely attempt to reinterpret it.
B0000039PW|5.0|I can't express how gratful I am to Amazon for let me listen to the preview track of this album. I want to thank them because they made me go out and buy thisalbum at my local music shop and now I own on of rap music legendary albums of all time. This album is like a moive and with his other album Life After Death, it come on hard, and direct to the listenrs ear. You can expect a lot of real issues biggie comments on about the youth and about how it's hard in sociaety when you are growning up in a low income hood. I know that anyone who order's this album will know why Biggie Smalls is always reffered to as the Greatest Rapper Of All Time.
B00005JKDR|4.0|There's a little something for everyone in this movie. It's kind of cartoonish for the little kids (might be just a little scary for some of them), lots of not really violent action, a plot that while silly (monsters scaring kids to capture their screams for use as an energy source) is pretty well done, good characterizations (especially John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike Wasowski)and some really interesting computer animation.<BR>These things alone would make it interesting to watch but if I buy it it'll be for the extras.

0151008116|5.0|The novel is rich in thought, but a bit surreal.  Parts of it our funny.<BR>Searching for a story, the author flies to Madras India where an elderly man tells him \\"I have a story that will make you believe in God.\\" (p.x)  The story is about Piscene Molitor Patel, an Indian named after a swimming pool in Paris, and his relationship with a tiger with whom he shared a lifeboat.<BR>The author acknowledges his indebtedness to \\"Mr Moacyr Scliar, for the spark of life.\\" (p.xii)  Twenty-one years earlier, Mr. Scliar, a Brazilian writer, wrote Max and the Cats, a book about a young Jew shipwrecked on a lifeboat with a panther.<BR>At age 16, Pi sails from Madras with his mother, father and brother and his father's zoo animals on board the Panama registered Japanese cargo ship Tsimstum bound for Canada.  Twelve days later the ship sinks.  Pi drifts for 227 days in a lifeboat from the Philippines to Tomatlan, Mexico.  \\"Winds and currents decided where I went.\\"  (p.193)<BR>Pi saves Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, from drowning, but then has second thoughts: \\"Wait a second.  Together?  We'll be together?  Have I gone mad?\\" (p.99)<BR>Pi's environment in the lifeboat is like that of a wild animal, \\"an environment where the supply of fear is high, and the supply of food low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites forever endured.\\" (p.16) <BR>Reason, that \\"fool's gold for the bright\\" (p.5), is Pi's defense against fear:  \\"Reason is fully equipped with the latest weapons technology.  But to your amazement, despite superior tactics and a number of undeniable victories, reason is laid low. You feel yourself weakening, wavering.  Your anxiety becomes dread.\\" (p.161)<BR>In the lifeboat he adapts himself to the three religions he embraced growing up:  he practices \\"solitary Masses without priests or consecrated Communion hosts, darshans without murtis, and pujas with turtle meat for prasad, acts of devotion to Allah not knowing where Mecca was and getting my Arabicwrong.\\" (p.208) <BR>Pi wishes for a Gideon Bible but all he has is the survival manual \\"which I must have read ten thousand times over the course of my ordeal.\\" (p.208) He tries to keep a diary, writing in tiny letters for fear of not having paper, but in the end his pen runs out of ink. <BR>Pi's emotions run deep. He experiences \\"the worst pair of opposites . . . boredom and terror.\\"(p.217) Like a pendulum his life swings from one to the other.  As the oil tanker powers past, paying no attention to the lifeboat, Pi turns to Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger who is his companion, and says \\"I love you.\\"  When the lifeboat hits the beach in Mexico and Richard Parker leaps into the jungle, Pi cries because their relationship \\"ends so unceremoniously.\\"(p.285)  Pi's describes his separation from Richard Parker as \\"an axe that chops at my heart.\\" (p.16)<BR>The juxtaposition of a vegetarian Indian teenager and a carnivorous 450 pound tiger, adapting to each other, makes Pi philosophic: \\"Things didn't turn out the way they were supposed to, but what can you do?

B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley stands as the most popular entertainer/singer of all time, his music changed the revolution of the planet, much like Beethoven, you can't really compare the two in style, but you can at the way they completely changed popular music for all time. Elvis remains now, more than ever, the most vital performer of the 20th century, this is because after he was unleashed onto the world, music forever was placed into the division of Before and After Elvis Presley. The Beatles, Jim Morrison and Chris Isaak, not to mention Tom Jones, Marilyn Manson and Sheryl Crowe are just a few of the countless upon countless performers that carry something of Elvis, no matter how large or small. \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" is a delightful tribute to the King and is a must for any rock collection, not least for the fact that the songs, newly digitally mastered, stand as the best quality releases ever of these classics. \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" still has a touch of danger that makes it into something of a thriller while \\"Hound Dog\\" is still explosive and dirty fun. \\"Love Me Tender\\" is still a classic ballad and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" is an immortal number that truly displays Elvis' flare. \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" is timeless, wonderfully romantic with a beautiful touch of slide guitar as Elvis croons with a voice so deep and rich it rivals Sinatra's. Yes, Elvis is a better crooner than Sinatra? Why? I believe the importance of an artist relies on how the music stands the test of time. Consider how more teenagers today listen to The Doors than they ever will The Jefferson Airplane, Frank Sinatra, as good as he is, is seen by most teens today as something for their grandparents, pretty tinkly music that sounds nice, but isn't cool. Elvis Presley remains cool, a true icon, his songs aren't stuck as replicas of an era, they are as relevant and popular today as they were then. Songs like \\"Suspicious Minds\\" do not stay stuck in a time and place, they are outside of their time. \\"You're The Devil In Disguise\\" is a fun jam with a cool tropical feel but the show-stopper is \\"A Little Less Conversation,\\" a remix that hit #1 in 13 countries and stands as a great dance track. Many styles in music have come and gone, but Elvis, the icon and singer remain. This is a collection that not only captures great popular music, but also the birth and essence of rock n' roll.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac Shakurs 5th album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; is one of his best. 1996 was a busy year for Shakur, this would be the last album he ever saw come out, and his only double album while he was alive. Two discs, with a total of 26 tracks. Disc one is full of tracks that would become party anthems tracks like &quot;California Love&quot; feat Dr. Dre, &quot;How do you want it&quot; feat. KC and Jojo, and &quot;2 of Amerikaz most Wanted&quot; feat. Death row labelmate Snoop. &quot;I aint Mad at Cha&quot; was a dedication track to fallen homies, with background pianos beats. Best track on this side though for me was &quot;Life goes on&quot;, one of my all time favourite tracks, where Pac talks about a lost friend, remember when they bumped it on the locals news after his passing, its one of those tracks where Pac goes incredibly deep. &quot;Heartz of Men&quot;, &quot;Only God can Judge Me&quot;  are two more memorable tracks on this side. Disc two starts off with the powerfull &quot;Shorty Wanna be a Thug&quot;. Tracks like &quot;Holla at Me&quot;, and &quot;Wonder why they Call you B****&quot; follow and are memorable. &quot;Thug Passion&quot; is a track for  the ladies, with and Pacs Outlawz make a good guest appearance. &quot;Picture me Rolling&quot; is one of the nicest tracks on this side, laid back track, where Pac talks about cruising, the police, and living thug life. &quot;Run Tha Streets&quot; and &quot;Heaven Aint Hard to Find&quot; close off the album well. Tupac seemed to know how close death was, and some of the tracks on this album, and of course his next one show this. Also he never hesitated to show his emotions, and after being locked up for a year he was not only angry but ready to take the rap game on lock once again which he did. &quot;All Eyes on Me&quot;, classic hiphop album for every collection.
B000056V73|5.0|Somewhere in the movie, this line is utters: &quot;You don't have a choice when it comes to music... true music finds you.&quot; Gems like this only come from the pen of Cameron Crowe and while this is the type of movie that everyone will love, you'll feel the passion if you're in on the same music fan wavelength that Crowe is.<br />There are several touching scenes; Crowe takes some soulful rock &amp; roll tunes and sets them to scenes that he always knew deserves to be played out to. It's like when you play a song, you have a picture of a scene, a setting, a situation that it plays to, and Crowe makes that come to life.
B00000055E|5.0|Tupac Shakur's \\"R U Still Down? (Remember Me)\\" came out in 1997, one year after his passing. Production could of been better on this album, but lyrics and 26 tracks definetly make it an album for the collection if your a pac fan. Nice tracks on disc one include the title track \\"R U still Down?\\", \\"Hellrazor\\" a powerfull track with sick beats as an angry Pac lays down memorable lyrics. \\"I wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto\\" is an upbeat track where Pac talks about growing up, making money, and thug life. \\"Nothing to Lose\\" is another ill track, Pac verses \\"Walk a mile in my shoes and you would be crazy too\\". \\"Im getting money\\", [and other songs] close off disc one well. Disc 2 comes next, third track \\"Hold on Be Strong\\", is an upbeat track sort of like \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\". \\"Do for Love\\" feat. Eric Williams (of blackstreet) is a deep and memorable track about love. \\"16 on Death Row\\" is a powerfull harcore track. \\"When I get free II\\" and \\"Only fear of Death\\" are both nice tracks and close off the album well. \\"R U still Down\\" is really an album dedicated to thug life, and Pac comes across powerfully, hes less poetic and less philosophical on this album then previous and later releases, this album is gangster rap at its best. What makes some of the later post-death albums (Untill the end of Time, Better Dayz) better in my opinion is they cover the time period (1994-1996) right before his death, while this album covers music from 1991-1994 period, when he was still progressing as an artist. \\"R U still Down\\" may not be for everyone, but if you love Pac like I do, you will appreciate this album.
B000063NPX|4.0|This is possibly one of the best Disney cartoon musicals ever made, and the last of its kind to merit any value at all. If not because of the plot and usual Disney stunt crutches, then it is the the music and old-style animation that make this cartoon real. The singing voices are amazing, and help transform the film from mere cartoon to a bona fide musical. The French setting especially allows for glorious accents and can-can song and dance numbers.<br />It's good enough to allow me to ignore the usual Disney cliches, although I cringe trying to imagine this on Broadway, or worse, on ice.
B000001Y16|5.0|Tupac Shakurs Sixth album, and first post death album  \\"The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\\" was released in November 1996, just two months after his passing. Exit 2pac, enter Makaveli. The album is twelve tracks in all, and contains guest appearances from Makavelis group the Outlawz, Val Young, KC & Jojo, and Tyrone Wrice. Album intro...begins with Pac calling out names, other rappers he was beefing with at the time: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Jay-Z, Mobb Deep. Tupac really lets loose on this album, coming out intense,dark and angry on many of the tracks like \\"Hail Mary\\", \\"Blasphemy\\" and \\"Life of an Outlaw\\". \\"Toss it Up\\" feat Kc & Jojo is a nice rap/r&b collab. \\"To Live and Die\\" is another more relaxed track a dedication to L.A. and California, although Pac doesnt hesitate to call out his former labelmate Dr. Dre,... \\"Just Like Daddy\\" feat. Outlawz is a track about the ladies. \\"Krazy\\" is a deep track, where Pac talks about thug life, time passing and getting high. \\"White Man'z World\\" and \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" follow and raise the albums tempo even more. \\"Hold ya Head\\" is another deep track about death, jail,money, lost homies, Pacs main message though is a positive one, keep yourself up no matter what. Album ends with \\"Against all the Odds\\" a powerful closer where Pac takes on all opposition and lets it be known he is ready for war. Tupac was developing more and more as an artist, and this music goes far beyond just anger and calling out names, into deep, powerful, music with an important message. This is definetly an album worth listening to and having in the collection.
B00006V9A0|4.0|after months of arguing and complaining done by courney love adn the 2 remaining members of nirvana, a 'GREATEST HITS' is finally released. <br />my opinion of this album is that it should have been a multi-CD set. nirvana had so much great music; adn great music that was not released; they should have just put their crumy little heads together; put unreleased tracks with some better highlights from their career('frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle'(In Utero), 'territorial pissings'(nevermind), 'negative creep'(bleach); any of these songs reing a bell?!<br />anyway; this collection is finally out, it is a good snapshot of the power of nirvana; and for any music fan just getting into them; this is a good introduction to them; and for anyone who was there; buy this and relive the genius of the most important band of the 90's.
B00007E8V4|5.0|i don't have this album yet-im getting this afternoon. i just want to make something clear-the tracks on this album aren't &quot;rejects&quot;, they're songs that System decided didnt fit in on Toxicity. peace out.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When you finish listening to this album, you finally realize that Christina grew up and really is a woman. Forget the teen pop image she has because that was 4 years ago. She is 22 years old and she should not be criticized for doing whatever she wants to do, that includes dressing provocatively. Her album screams of maturity and real raw talent. She wrote most of the album and is an executive producer of it too. She has that in your face, I don't give a s h i t what you call me attitude in the album. So if you hate Christina for being who she is, she doesn't give a damn. <BR>Walk Away is a great blues ballad that carries tons of emotion, great lyrical content, and of course Miss Aguilera's trademark voice. <BR>Can't Hold Us Down is a true feminist anthem that addresses the unjust double standards of men and women in society. She asks,&quot;Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?&quot; I haven't heard a feminist anthem in a long time, and I applaud Christina for making one. <BR>Beautiful is truly beautiful. Her voice shines with hurt and pain on the track. it's a very uplifting song. It has a great strings arraingment and on it too. <BR>Fighter with it's rock edge, thanks to the great guitar cameo of Dave Navarro, addresses how her old manager backstabbed her and that the experience made her into a smarter and stronger person. Loving Me For Me is a Neo-Soul gem. Her voice on this track runs like smooth syrup, with a cool and calm tone. <BR>I'm Okay is quite haunting, but also very real. Christina deals with the abuse that her and her mother experienced at the hand's of her father. She struggles to confess,&quot;It hurts me to see the pain across my mothers face, everytime my father's fist would put her in her place...it's not easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck and when I was thrown against cold stairs.&quot; I applaud Christina for having the guts to address an issue that no one in music has really done, since most sing about having all theice and money they have. <BR>Overall this album is packed with a lot of excellent and mature singing, producing and writing skills. Don't judge this album based on Dirrty, because it's nothing like it.<BR>Christina has proved with this album that she has the talent to last her for many years to come.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As founder of the All-Movie Guide (AllMovie.com), I have seen and overseen countless thousands of movies rated and reviewed. This is the single best (in my experience) war movie ever made and one of the best movies ever made, from any genre. I was so impressed with it that I watched it a second time within a few days -- all 11+ hours of it. Then I read the book (which takes less time than watching the movie), but it added very little to the experience. I am grateful that this film exists. The DVD transfer and sound were excellent. -- Michael Erlewine...
B00003CXI1|5.0|As I've read all of J.K Rowling's books, I found the first one was the most exciting by far. After I've watched the movie, I found that it looks just about exactly the same as the book. I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to any kid who is a Harry Potter  fan and liked to read books on Fantasies.
B00005JL96|5.0|First of all, please forgive me for going on in this review like I'm writing a college essay - the film is light and fun, and I don't want you to get the impression that it is anything less. I just want to answer the charge that no thought has gone into the issues covered in the film, or that the film indulges in meanness for the sake of a cheap laugh. This is not an attack on the reviewer that made the review I disagree with, but an explanation of why I disagree with the reviewer's points. I've never answered a review directly before, but I liked this film, and feel that the review by \\"storyboarder\\" elsewhere on this review page (who no doubt makes points that others agree with) was a little unfair, and that maybe the reviewer and others aren't reading between the lines as well as they should if they're truly choosing to hold this film to its apparent themes as rigorously as they claim.<br />The film did indeed take on a weighty subject as the reviewer says, but I don't agree it was handled lightly - grief is implied, not ignored. We don't need to be shown in a Disney film how people react to grief, and to expect Disney to explain the concept of the death of a parent to children is unfair... Disney is in the business of giving us and our children entertainment. Penny in \\"The Rescuers\\" was an orphan, but I don't remember anyone expecting a detailed study of how being an orphan affected her present or future life!<br />The true theme of the story is, in my view, isolation and loneliness, feelings probably experienced and understood by many children at some point in their lives. Stitch was supplied as a different perspective to the same pain - where Lilo and Nani have lost their family, Stitch never had one. Bringing Lilo and Stitch together combines two characters who are natural companions because they both understand what it is to be lonely and isolated, and almost by definition only have each other as true companions, even if they don't realise it.<br />The film is light in places - it couldn't be \\"sad\\" all the way through otherwise it would grind on and on, either sending children to sleep or into tears. The characters relieve the tension with plenty of fun moments, such as training Stitch to be more like Elvis, or \\"frolicking on the beach\\". Who cares where the little Elvis costume came from! I've seen kids on television impersonating Elvis... maybe Lilo bought it from the same place as they did! The fun and companionship in the surfing scene is also a necessary element for Stitch to witness, not just an excuse for a surfing scene, as it shows him what he is rejecting when he fights Lilo's attempts to make him part of her family.<br />As for meanness in the story or jokes in the film being mean-spirited - well, part of the theme of the film is the redemption of Stitch, just as it is for Ebeneezer Scrooge in \\"A Christmas Carol\\", a character who is similarly mean-spirited, and also a parody of himself. As with Scrooge, Stitch's redemption would have no value if he weren't really bad to begin with! The greater the bad, the greater the value of the change to good at the end, and also the greater the goodness of the good characters for putting up with and persisting with the bad one!<br />\\"Lilo and Stitch\\" is one of the best animated films I've seen in many a long year. It isn't out to force-feed anyone's view of family morality, but is instead a true-to-modern-life story that many, many children will identify with, and also a nice redemption story in it's own right... if it has a fault, it's that the Disney mould for running time is too short for such an original and therefore valuable story, and perhaps it also ends a little too suddenly at the end, as if a better idea for an ending was abandoned at the last minute in favour of a more compact ending.<br />Chris Sanders, the voice of Stitch, is the person who came up with the idea of the story, did the original design drawings, contributed to the writing of the story, and alsoco-directed it along with Dean DeBlois. It is my hope that here is another great like Don Bluth in the making (and perhaps a Gary Goldman in Dean DeBlois). I will be watching out for their names in the future.<br />Well done Disney... I'm only sorry I wasn't able to see this film when I was 8, and had it to enjoy as a childhood memory throughout my life. I'll bet it's a while before we see the like of this film from Disney again. \\"Lilo and Stitch\\"'s unexpected popularity will probably cause it to be seen as a 'winning formula', and see it milked for all its worth, but I hope this first film of any future series manages to stay looking as fresh and original as it is now forever!
B0000640VN|4.0|It's your classic Meg Ryan vehicle, with time travel thrown in for good measure. Hugh Jackman shines as the well-mannered charmer, Breckin Meyer is quite funny as the amiable dunce. Alas, the reference to La Boheme is amusing. Leopold came from 1876, when Puccini was 18, La Boheme didn't premiere until 1896. It doesn't bode well for Hollywood when not one person involved in the movie knew this or at least checked the facts.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Someone in the marketing department at Universal should get fired.  First they said that the only way to get the original edit of E.T. was to shell out [some hefty cash].  (I wonder how many people decided not to bother because of the prohibitive cost?)<br />The decision to have both editions available in one set at a lower price was announced only a week before the DVD was released.<br />The packaging of the lower priced DVD is also pathetic.  It looks fine facing out in the store, with the clear plastic window on the moon-colored disc, but there is no title on the spine.  Also the cardboard trees over the cardboard window is already starting to peel away on my package.  Remove the security labels with care, as this can also damage the cardboard package.<br />This is E.T.  The highest grossing film of all time between 1982 & 1997.  A beloved film by critics & audiences alike.  Universal should have given it more respect.<br />I admit I have yet to watch the special edition.  I hesitate to tarnish the memory of the original, which still moves and engages me.
0920668364|5.0|This book was placed in my hands by a tear-stained-face mother who expressed that she heard excerpts of the book at a recent funeral.  She conveyed that she witnessed a child reading excerpts of the book at the funeral of his own mother stating that was his way of honoring his mother.  After reading the book myself in addition to being a mother of two sons, I couldn't help having my maternal feelings penetrated by such lovely and reality-based feelings.  I couldn't help thinking of my two young sons and/or children whom I am blessed to be around and read it to them! It's obvious the author is a gifted and talented storyteller.  This book was obviously written with love.  How wonderful that this book can stand alone on its text.  This book is heart-felt, a life-changer, and has been written with clean motives.  It's spiritual soul food to the essence.  It's unfortunate that those who have written poor reviews of this book seem to focus their warped perceptions on the illustrations of the book or took in the words of the text the wrong way.  I guess that's what happens when you don't have loving parents teach you true and unconditional love from day one.  I can only thank my lucky stars that this book was brought to light in my own life so that I can pass it down to my own children because I do love my children forever even though I don't always like what they do!  Happy Reading for those open-minded and blessed with a child's heart!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I always liked the Spider-Man comics.  Spider-Man (& his alter ego, Peter Parker) is portrayed as an ordinary guy struggling to balance superheroics with the real world.  This is in contrast with D.C.'s Batman comics where Bruce Wayne, as a millionaire, has no financial concerns, and Superman, where his job as a mild mannered reporter helps put him where he is most needed.  But I always had reservations about some parts of the Spider-man origin story.  In the comic book, after Peter Parker acquires his Spider powers, he becomes a professional wrestler (like in the film), but he garners some fame and fortune and when the robber runs past he doesn't stop the crook simply because he didn't feel it was his job.  The movie pointedly gave Peter Parker a motive for letting the robber go.  Later in the comic that very same robber breaks into Peter's house and murders his Uncle Ben.  This struck me as a severe plot contrivance which was lessened in the film by having this villain kill Uncle Ben in a carjacking.<br />When I read about the talent behind this movie I was excited.  Sam Raimi has impressed me ever since Evil Dead 1, Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst were also perfectly cast.  And when I watched the movie they did not disapoint.  The romance between them is the most stirring part of the movie.<br />This movie possesses a spirit similar to Superman: The Movie, even if it lacks that film's epic quality. There are parrellels to Superman.  Both are mild-mannered in their alter egos, both work for a newspaper -- Clark Kent as a reporter, Peter Parker as a freelance photographer, both have loudmouthed editors, although Perry White is a supporter of Superman, while J. Jonah Jameson loathes Spider-Man (J.K. Simmons in a terrific performance).  But the plot of Superman is grander, beginning on Krypton, going to Smallville, Metropolis and for the climax all over the U.S. while Spider-Man keeps itself firmly in New York and is divided into 2 distinct acts; pre-graduation, and post-graduation.<br />This film has some great acting and humorous, stylish direction with a few visual cues lifted from the Batman & Superman movies which feel more like homages than rip-offs.<br />The plot is a basic origin/first adventure narrative.  We are introduced to Peter Parker, shy high school senior, on his way to a field trip where he gets bitten by a geneticly enhanced spider giving him super powers, which he at first wants to use for profit, but then, after tragedy strikes, he uses it to do ggod deeds.<br />Simultaneous to Peter's transformation, his best friend's father, Norman Osborn, is conducting tests on himself to turn himself into a super soldier.  These experiments cause him to go insane and become the Green Goblin.<br />Naturally it is only a matter of time before super hero and super villain meet.<br />Another refreshing elemnt of this movie is that the origins are kept seperate, unlike so many other super hero movies where the villains and the heroes are involved in creating each other.  Spider-Man has no direct involvement in the creation of the Green Goblin, and the Green Goblin is not involved in Spider-Man's development.<br />The only liablilty this movie has is in the visual effects.  When Superman was released it came with the tag line \\"You will belive a man can fly.\\"  They spent that much time on the special effects to make certain the the flying scenes looked realistic.  In Spider-Man, though, the web-swinging moments are obviously computer animated, resembling a computer game more than a feature film, as though Sam Raimi didn't care much about the effects either.<br />Thankfully the human element of the movie saves the day, keeping it compelling to allow me to suspend my disbelief through these more awkward special effects sequences.ost-graduation.<br />This film has some great acting and humorous, stylish direction with a few visual cues lifted from the Batman & Superman movies which feel more like homages than rip-offs.<br />The plot is a basic origin/first adventure narrative.

B00005LQ04|5.0|I saw \\"Suspiria\\" on its' release in 1977 with a group of friends and no one liked it but me. I was just blown away. It's been at the top of my list for years. I've since owned various incarnations of it ever since it appeared on tape. There's never been a good print of it until Anchor Bay got a hold of it. I now own the 3-disc set on DVD and couldn't be happier with it. The film is intoxicating from start to finish. Jessica Harper was the ideal choice for the American ballet student who dances her way right into a witches' coven in a German dance academy. Joan Bennett and Alida Valli are solid ice as the acadamys' overseers. What Argento can do with colors, sets and atmosphere are phenomenally on display here. The Goblin score is almost unbearably intense. Schoolgirls take on a menacing aura as the newcomer (Harper) struggles to fit in and establish some sort of independence much to Bennetts' and Vallis' chagrin. Harper is curious as to the teachers' nightly activities and when her also suspicious roommate disappears, she sets out to uncover the truth. The rain of maggots on the girls from the rotting food in the attic is still an unsettling sequence. But the murder set pieces are the real chillers. These are some of the most elaborate, garish and grisly deaths Argento has orchestrated in any of his films. The climax when Harper discovers the ancient witch Helena Marcos' resting place only to have her rise and summon the corpse of Harpers' roommate is one of the most terrifying sequences Argento has ever done. When Harper stabs the witch in the neck all Hell breaks loose and the walls literally come tumbling down in flames. With \\"Deep Red\\", this is my favorite of Argentos' films. The interviews with Harper and others on the Anniversary disc are really entertaining and informative. And the entire Goblin soundtrack is on another disc as well. A fantastic package and collectors' item. \\"Suspiria\\" ranks as one of the best horror films ever made by anyone. Simply a modernclassic.
B000068QY7|4.0|After all the rubbish with blur in the past, the Gallaghers have firmly established themselves as better than blur and one of the greatest British rock bands ever.<BR>This album is their 5th album and is a definite improvement from the not so popular album Standing on the shoulders of giants (SOTSOG)<BR>I would give this album a 4 because they are definately heading in the right directions with great melodies.<BR>The best song is not a Liam sung sung, but one which Noel sings, and is also the third single on the album.<BR>Its called Little by little and is awesome.<BR>Other awesome songs are Hindu times, force of nature , Dont cry your heart out and she is love
078401213X|5.0|This has become one of my favorite films of all time. It is so good. Yes it is in black and white, and it's a bit confusing, but I loved it. Not for everyone though. Especially those who like films such as The New Guy or Scary Movie. I loved this film and I hope you do to.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've already read all the reviews that tell you what happens in the movie. All I know is I've seen it now three times in the past two days, and I must own this movie in the near future. It touches upon irony in such a way as to make one beg for more. Intelligent, witty, altering, and incredible. I've seen some very good movies, but this one is now fighting its way on my top three of all time. This movie should be seen.
6300267881|5.0|The Exorcist is definately the scariest movie I've seen. This destroys films like Psycho, The Changeling, The Ring, Halloween, Silence of the Lambs, The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen. This is definately the SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! Not even The Evil Dead could rival this film. I would recommend watching it alone in the dark to get the ultimate experience if your brave enough. Buy it or rent it now. I prefer THE  VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN but any version will do. Oh yeah, remember this is the REAL DEAL! This is THE SCARIEST MOVIE YOU'LL EVER SEE!
0345448898|5.0|I read about 60-70 Sf and Fantasy books per year, and these books blew my mind. Mr. Pullman has created one of the first new fantasy concepts that I have come across in the last 10 years. While these are technically children's books, they are definitely not as \\"cutesy\\" as Harry Potter or other, similar, works. These books are a truly engrossing read.
6304711875|1.0|This was not scary at all, but was hilarious! Why did they spoof it, it was funny enough as it was. It ripped-off so many good horror films, and was so unrealistic and stupid, that it couldn't even be a suspense film! This is so dumb and it is nothing compared to The Exorcist! Don't see this for a scare, but if a good laugh is what you are looking for, than this is the one for you.
0780625129|4.0|Edward Norton, one of today's finest actors, stars as a former white supremacist recently released from prison who tries to save his brother Edward Furlong from following in his footsteps.  The movie deals with the current part of the story in colour, while the back story explaining Norton's past is presented in stark black and white.  The viewer gets to see the language and violence of hate that spewed from Norton, and very little is held back.  It's disturbing to watch.  His \\"conversion\\" away from racism is not as explicitly presented, and I found it to be a weaker part of the story.  Considering the depths of his white supremacist beliefs, not enough detail and time is given to explaining why he turns around.  Norton is riveting in the central role, bringing an all-too convincing charisma to a character that at times repulses the viewer.  Furlong, usually a weak actor in my opinion, is stronger than I have seen him before.  The supporting cast are fine.  The black and white and colour cinematography are excellent and used to great effect.  I don't want to spend time analyzing the speeches given and the film's point of view, because at the end, regardless of where you stand politically, the message is pretty clear.  At times, it's not an easy to film to sit through, but I don't know if racism, a topic of many a film, has ever been presented in so direct and disturbing a way.
B00006J3WH|5.0|After watching the greatest show on earth for six years, this wonderful episodes airs.  The only episode that can even come close to being considered better is &quot;The Wish,&quot; any-way Joss Whedon the creator of the show spent 4 months writting the score for this CD(For which he should have won an emmy for), with many catchy, and possibly foreshadowing songs.  A must have for any fan, Pay close attention to track 2.
B000056HE9|5.0|\\"The 'Bishops' Wife\\" is a wonderful film... (it's the original film for the remake done with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston a few years back called \\"The 'Preachers' Wife\\" - which was was ok but seemed like a rushed Hollywood remake and failed to capture that innocent quaint magic of this original}.  Cary Grant infused a smooth suaveness into his role as the Angel that Denzel just didn't quite seem to bring to his.<br /><br />In this original film, Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven capture the essence, the 'wonderment' and that magical 'something' that touches a cord deep down inside of you.  From the snowball fight, to the angel on ice, to the wine bottle that never empties, you will be chuckling and smiling as it takes you on a fun journey to its unpredictable ending.<br /><br />The special effects are nothing spectacular compared to today's standards, but for the time period in which this B&W was made, it invites your attention and as it unravels to allow you (and your chidren) to double-take with amazement... and if you dare to let go and loose yourself in this film, you will marvel, and believe that angels do walk amongst us, and that seemingly normal, sometimes odd inexplicable occurances in our everyday lives today often do reflect the magic of Christmas time.<br /><br />You'll be adding this to your list of Christmas classics (like \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\").  A GREAT movie to watch with that special someone, or the kids....<br /><br />So grab a cup of hot chocolate, some apple cider (or even a hot-toddy ;-) on a cold evening and snuggle in to enjoy this feature...and by the time it's over, ...that good feeling you have? ...well that's just an added bonus (that I bet you didn't count on being included for free with the cost of this film ;-).<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000002MY3|1.0|What makes Alanis such a treasure is the honesty of her convictions and her absolute allegiance to commoners everywhere.  When she plaintively emotes &quot;I've got one hand in my pocket,&quot; you realize she could be singing about anyone.
B0000640VN|5.0|This movie does more than entertain you. This movie makes you want to get up and find YOUR true love. Inspiring and amazing are the words that first come in to my mind when watching this movie. Meg Ryan places a top executive and Hugh Jackson places a Duke from the year 1876. The plot thickens as you sit wishing she would fall in love with him, after he was time warped into the current year 2001. Every second counts, so don't stop watching for a second. You'll fall in love with each character every time you watch this marvelous piece of work. Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend. Do whatever you have to in order see this movie. You won't regret it.
0790744295|5.0|CREEPSHOW is one of those movies that grows on you after you first see it. It's an undisputed horror classic from the infamous George A. Romero and the pristine and terrific writer Stephen King. When you view the five spook 'n' thrill tales of CREEPSHOW, you'll know you're watching a classic.<br />\\"Father's Day\\" is a good ole story of old-fashioned revenge from the dead old man that rises from the grave to get what he wants...a cake...but not your typical cake by any means. It's delightfully frightening, but chilling and creepy enough to keep you on your seat.<br />\\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verill\\" Stephen King makes this one kind of eerie, very quirky, and kind of sad. But there are some chills to behold in this little quirk of a gem. Stephen King really does fit the role of Jordy in this one, does a snap-up job in this strange tale of a meteor crash that causes major green growth and Jordy's quiet but \\"bang at the end\\" death. <br />\\"Something To Tide You Over\\" Ted Danson is a classic actor, and seeing Leslie Nielsen play someone bad is a treat. This one really gives you some chills and some scares as Nielsen stars as someone who buries a couple alive at the shores and then gets buried himself by their vengeful zombies. Fine acting and a fine story indeed!<br />\\"The Crate\\" This one is the most terrifying of the bunch, and the best of them. Hal Holbrook is just fiendishly terrific and the supporting cast, with the likes of Adrienne Barbeau, is just dandy. A gory, bloody, and horrifying tale of a monster in a crate that kills people under the stairs, but then gets dumped over a cliff by Hal's character...and is the area safe from the primate monster?<br />\\"They're Creeping Up On You\\" A wealthy millionaire who is afraid of cockroaches gets to witness his worst fear come true as thousands upon thousands of cockroaches bring him to his untimely death, and one of the most horrifying finales. Not the best of the bunch, and not really too scary, but still quite enjoyable.<br />CREEPSHOW is a great movie for Halloween movie marathons, or if you just want a good scare, this is just what the video collection ordered for you! Delightful, scary, spooky, chilling, and worth the price of admission...in your own home!
6300214435|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has caught a LOT of flack over the years since its first release. It's hard to say whether or not the criticism has died down a bit; the movie sure does seem to have its fan base. Admittedly, not all the stated faults are unfair or have no justification; this is indeed the most flawed of the Indiana Jones adventures. But as such, a deeply flawed Jones outing is still likely more fun than the next dozen summerblockbusters you're likely to see all year long.<br />Set in 1935 (meaning this is a prequel to Raiders), Harrison Ford once again stars as our titular hero, this time in a Chinese nightclub, making a trade for a valuable diamond. Things don't go as planned and an all-out brawl ensues, finally resulting in Jones, singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) on the run from a Chinese gang. They eventually take off on a plane carrying poultry cargo, but the pilots happen to work for the leader of that gang Jones had the run in with. <br />Thus, Jones and his two partners are stuck in India, where they arrive at a devastated village. Investigating further, Jones decides to head to Pankot Palace, which seems to be the source of the problem. There he discovers the renewed Thugee Cult, bent on world domination with the complete collection of the Sankara Stones. Just what these stones will do...the movie doesn't specify. But this all leads to Indiana Jones kicking [butt], and lots of it, too.<br />The somewhat lukewarm response Temple of Doom initially received wasn't surprising. As the sequel to (at the time) the greatest action movie in existence, there's a lot to live up to. I, for one, was not disappointed. The movie promised a breathless thrill ride and it delivered one. And where else are you going to see elaborate booby traps and exotic settings?<br />Temple of Doom's first half is sensationally entertaining, actually about the equal of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie's opening action sequence is a knockout, and the scenes afterward find the right touch of creepiness to make for an intriguing story. It only gets better when they reach Pankot Palace, as we witness the classic dinner scene, truly funny romantic interaction between Jones and Willie, and a spike-filled booby trap scene that is alternately suspenseful and hilarious, thanks to Ford's dead-on reaction (\\"We are going to Die!\\"). <br />It's the second half that isn't as successful. Once Jones actually encounters the Thuggee Cult, things get rather unpleasant. The sight of children being whipped stops the fun to a dead halt, and there's a fairly graphic depiction of a man whose heart is removed...by hand. These scenes are also set underground, which makes for a very grimy and dark setting, not necessarily the best for an adventure movie.<br />But thankfully, things pick up significantly for the final half-hour, which is arguably the most exciting extended action sequence of the whole trilogy. It all begins with thrilling fistfights and whip-swinging, then turns to a rollercoaster ride on a minecart, then concludes on a shaky bridge overlooking a river full of alligators. The action is wildly thrilling and breathtaking, featuring awesome stunts and brilliant cinematography (particularly during the minecart chase). There's also one shot which features Jones standing poised right before he knocks out a villain (off-screen) that's probably the coolest single scene in the whole series. <br />Interestingly enough, Temple of Doom happens to be the only Jones film that ends on an action sequence; in this case, we get four. How can anyone complain about that, especially considering just how damned entertaining these action scenes are? Yeah, there are a few implausibly silly moments, especially the scene where Willie and Short Round cross an entire bridge without noticing the villain on the other side. But such contrivances are forgivable given just how viscerally exciting the movie is.<br />John Williams' score nicely reuses the Raiders march theme to great effect. The other themes in the score are nicely done, a fitting match to the movie's tone and pacing. The special effects and production values are mostly excellent, only the imposition of the alligators at the end is slightly unconvincing. Otherwise, the movie looks like it could have just been released for the first time yesterday. <br />Where Temple of Doom definitely improves over Raiders is the humor quotient, which is a few notches higher in quantity and quality here. Harrison Ford's performance contributes highly to this factor, just note his reaction to a threat off-screen (you'll know what I'm talking about, it's the scene right after he dispatches of two swordfighters). I think we're all in agreement when we say no one else could have played this role half as well as Ford. It's the part he was born for, and he's absolutely terrific. As for Kate Capshaw, she can be loud and annoying, but I actually prefer her over Karen Allen, if only because she and Ford have better chemistry together.<br />At any rate, The Temple of Doom is still great fun, and certainly superior to any bit of escapist entertainment Hollywood's churned out the past several months. Apparently, Spielberg didn't much like this film, so The Last Crusade was his atonement. He didn't need to apologize, but it's nice to see his apology wound up being the best action film I've ever seen. By the way, has anybody else wondered how Indiana Jones managed to retrieve his brown coat (which was left in the cave) and still get ahead of the children at the end?
B00000I924|3.0|Jeff Beck is a very accomplished guitar player.  In spite of all the mdoern touches specifically the techno beats, Jeff's guitar remains front and center.  There are some very creative touches on this release most notably Declan, Another Place, Space For The Papa, and Brush With The Blues.  Jeff always seems to vary his tone which always makes his material a fresh listen.<br />However, with all the breath taking guitar solos, many of the songs just meander a bit too much.  Coupled with the lack of a consistent presence of a keyboard or additional melody instrument, the routine gets a little stale even with all of Jeff's tone colorings.  Its funny how this recording hypes a reunion between keyboardist Tony Hymas and Beck.  However, Hymas's touches are few and far between.  The drumming and bass work is pretty good although the techno beats are a bit nerve racking at times.<br />A good effort yes, but Who Else is indeed a far cry from Blow By Blow.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've owned this movie for about three years and I still can't get enough of it. I have tortured so many of my friends and family by making them watch it -- they have all ended up loving it, even the guys.  But Colin Firth, what can I say?  Wow!  One reviewer noted that Darcy seems stiff and not very impressive on the first viewing but then after you have watched the movie several times you notice that his subtle facial expressions mean so much.  This is so true!  Colin Firth can say pages of dialogue without ever opening his mouth just through slight smirks and looks of adoration from his eyes.  You know he's falling in love with Lizzie from the second time they meet just by the way he looks at her.  Lizzie is such an amazing character who is witty and strong all at the same time.  My favorite line in the movie is when Lizzie is being confronted by Lady Catherine about the rumored engagement between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy in which Lizzie states, &quot;He is a gentleman, I am a gentleman's daughter, thus far we are equals.&quot;  I just want to stand up and cheer everytime I watch.  I highly recommend this miniseries!  If I had to pick only one movie to have the rest of my life, this would be it without hesitation! One other note -- Lizzie's father's dialogue is some of the funniest and truest to human nature of anything I've heard. <br />Also, if you enjoy Colin Firth as much as I do, I would also recommend &quot;Brigdet Jones' Diary.&quot;
B00003CWPL|5.0|Shocking, disturbing, disorienting and ... magnificent.<br />Think of it as a cinematic Rorschach test. Forgot about logic,<BR>plot and character development. This is a work that speaks<BR>directly to the id, perhaps the most successful attempt to do so<BR>in history. When the delusions and rationalizations that keep us<BR>sane (or blind) are stripped away we face what we really <BR>are - tiny beings adrift in a disturbing and mysterious universe.<BR>Eraserhead is made of this strangeness. If comfort is your goal, <BR>do not view this film. You may never get it out of your head. If <BR>instead you wish to be awake then use this film and be grateful <BR>that in an industry devoted to escapism, propaganda and product <BR>placement that you got the chance.
1878424114|5.0|It's Deepak Chopra, need we say more? I picked-up this book at my local library about 4 days ago, and being a very short and small book, I've already read it and am stunned. The first Law (in a nustshell) says to \\"Practice Non-Judgment\\" for 1 day. You say the affirmation in the morning and remind yourself throughout the day - yada, yada - get the picture? Anyways, I hadn't driven 1 mile when I was already whining about the \\"idiot\\" drivers on the road. I had to laugh out loud and shake my head. Boy, do I have work to do! :o) Anyways, this book is a kick in the butt and an eye-opener IF YOU ARE READY. Always remember: When the student is ready, the teacher appears. Well, I do believe my teacher appeared.
B00006LFGD|5.0|EVERY duet you could imagine is on here in one complete package! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH said! From Sinatra all the way to Donna Summer and down to new boy Josh Groban...WOW. Why didn't the two most memorable and alluring PREMIER FEMALE Vocalists of the modern rock-pop era ever record a duet together during the three decades(60s through the 80s) they simultaneously raced up and down the record charts so popularly and gloriously, platinum &amp; gold records, accolades, etc. all over the place? They never competed, but seemed to compliment each other's presence so well. One reviewer writes that Streisand has &quot;no equal&quot; female vocalist on the planet...but alas, LINDA RONSTADT and Barbra are both indeed quite equal to each other. Everybody who is/was anybody in music seems to have made a record with Barbra. WHY NOT RONSTADT?  Those are the two most notable female vocalists of the baby boomers era, save Connie Francis. Forget they both recorded for different record companies, many of these were on different labels too.
B00000J7S8|4.0|...and if you haven't seen her live, you really owe yourself an evening with her.  Her music is simply magic and this cd only extends on the joy this woman can bring you.  From the great 'Devil May Care' to the funny 'Popsicle Toes', light some candles, dim the lights, and put in this cd...trust me, you'll have a fun evening.
B000002KB8|5.0|The test of a great album is, can you play it years after its release and get that same old thrill? With their self-titled \\"Black Sabbath\\", the goosebumps still rise. Ozzy's sinister and tortured voice, Iommi's blistering guitar, Ward's attacking drums and Butler's expressive bass combine to produce something very rare in Heavy Metal - a complete, cohesive statement with the sum greater than the parts. Rather than an unremitting heavy metal thrashing, the tempo of this album is continually changing, framing the head-banging barrages and allowing the listener to catch his breath. The slower-paced interludes transition seamlessly into scorching bursts of mayhem and give a sense of foreboding to the music - a darker, richer sound than you're likely to hear from any other heavy metal album. The playing is focussed and superb, not a weak link in the bunch. If you want to hear Heavy Metal at its beginning and at its peak simultaneously, this is it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Is there any wonder why this film made $400 million at the box office this year??  Great story line, great chemistry with characters...funny, it's formulaic but who cares!  It's Spiderman!  And of course, the success of the first brings about 2 sequels to make to look forward to now.  Just a wonderful movie that really the whole family will enjoy.
B00005RG6B|5.0|Excellent performance of the band.....with excellent audio and professional guidance......A MUST HAVE
B00004KD1L|4.0|As some may know, GA does both up beat and downbeat tracks on a lot of their cds.  What you prefer may depend on your mood that day but more often than not, the downtempo tracks on here really stick out for me...they include:<br />a private interlude<BR>at the river - should be a james bond title track<BR>your song - beautiful vocals<br />I listen to those songs over and over again.  Look, 'I see you baby' is a good song, and the remix is okay, but when I think of this cd, I think of its downtempo side more than I do the upbeat side....listen to the tracks and you decide if you Jeckyl of if you're Hyde...
B00006G8G1|5.0|An unbelivable dvd, great concert, great special effects great setlist.........amazing....<BR>   Don't believe all the \\"too many cameras\\" [stuff].... its everything great....sound.... video.... setlist..... features...etc<BR>...
B000000H57|5.0|The only thing that this record needs is more Bass. <BR>Otherwise, a gothic classic.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Finally, System of a down has released a lot of its great unrleased tracks and some on soundtracks such as streamline from the scorpion king soundtrack. All the tracks are great and continue with system of a down's great sound of playing hard and fast while having a sense of humar and a political edge. Most of the songs are that typical system of a down sound but steal this album has roulette and streamline which are softer songs which help to expand system of a down's sound such as the songs aerials from toxicity. The songs are all great as I said but should have contained more such as the song shame they did with old dirty bastard and their great cover of the legend of zelda theme songs (with lyrics song that only SOAD could do).
B00006RU5B|5.0|From the first track, the first single &quot;Cochise&quot;, you know you are in for quite a ride. Tom Morrello is better than Soundgarden's guitarist and Chris Cornell's voice is more powerful than ever. And even though it is not as ground-breaking as Soundgarden's Superunknown, it is just a amazing, if not better. This by the way blows Rage's debut album (their best one too) away! More than worth the wait! Get it now, listen to me.
0743201140|5.0|The book's strength, to turn the tables a bit, is not in its length (less than average amount of words per page, about 250 pages), not in its style (written at a relatively low level), and not in its technical explanations (very little justification and explanation for the theories it proposes).  The strength of the book is how it introduces a new vocabulary for identifying an individual's potential strengths and talents.<br />The reader must go to a web site and take an assessment test rather early in the book.  After the reader takes the test, Buckingham and Clifton work at unraveling old ways of looking at performance and standard practices.  For example, they dare to suggest that the paradigm of improving a person's weaknesses as a strategy to implement optimum performance on the job or elsewhere is faulty.  You may disagree, and you may find the test useless if you take it.  In my instance, the test clearly verfied my areas of talent.  So I gave the book five stars, because it's an amazing groundbreaking book - we now have a way to identify and talk about 34 different groups of human talents - and I don't care how Gallup, Buckingham, and Clifton arrived at the results they did if the results are clearly true, as in my case.<br />Now, Discover Your Strengths doesn't tell you how to find a career based on your top five strengths.  It's a very personal decision, and also impractical, given that about 33 million combinations of five exist.  Buckingham and Clifton give examples of successful people and what they chose as careers, which utilize some combination of their strengths, and other useful suggestions, such as strategies to mitigate weaknesses.<br />Highly recommended.  I never would have known any of this had someone not suggested I read the book, and now a whole new way of looking at myself and the world is open to me.  econ
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down has done it again.Great songs,Great lyrics and Great beats.But a new thing they did was put some new background music in there songs that you will notice if you buy/listen to this CD.Like I-E-A-I-A-I-O or Chic N Stew.Roulette I think reminds me of Ariels,good slow song(powerful).Another good song is Mr.Jack,Great song.Also &quot;Inner vision&quot;(the popular one) is a good one too.But all in all its a good CD and should be bought by any SOAD or Rock fans out there.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I had seen Toy Story and A Bug's Life, and I had always liked that type of animation, but in this film it's taken to a new level, a new world, if you will.  The animation is stunning, the characters are lovable, the story is timeless.  Both adults and children will enjoy this movie! <BR>The special features on this dvd will blow you away!  Countless featurettes, trailers, tv spots, promos, conceptional art, and other bonus material that will take you all day to ingest!!!  So, bottom line: BUY THIS DVD!!!
B00006CXXU|4.0|What makes this album so great is taht Christina had input on almost all of the songs.  So they are a direct reflection of what she was going through at the time.  I loved her last studio album, but the songs on Stripped are less manufactured.<br />My favourites are Beautiful, Cruz, Can't hold us down and The Voice Within.
B000060P79|5.0|I remember when I first heard \\"I'd Do Anything\\" the second song released off this album. The catchy music, and Pierre's incredible voice had me hooked. I went and downloaded that song plus \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and later got the cd! It [was bad] for me, because I had to get someone to find it, because they were all hidden! So it's no surprise that not many people have heard of this great band! Each song has it's own different melodies. And I guarantee that there's atleast ONE song you'd feel like you wrote yourself! They just cover so much that teens go through, without sounding depressing our overly poppy! So many different emotions captured on one great cd. So if you're looking for a great cd that you can listen to over and over without getting tired of it, or something to just sing along to, I definately reccomend this cd.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This band represents everything that is wrong with pop music:  trite lyrics, annoying, whiny vocals, boring guitar parts, and repetitive hooks.  The song &quot;How You Remind&quot; is the worst song ever written...no, I didn't even like it the first time I heard it.  No I have not bought this whole album, but why should I?  I think I can judge a band well enough by their hit song to know I hate them with a PASSION.  I also hate everyone who listen to them...you will not be my frined if you like Nickelback (or Puddle of Mudddddddddddddddddddddddd).
6305696071|5.0|I bought this for my wife and I must say, I would normally have given this kind of movie a 4, but it kept my attention for the full time and I didn't fast forwawrd once, and my wife was so happy to get it, I gave it a five.....If you have to see a chick flick, this is one of the ones that are actually fun to watch.<br />Peace,<br />Morley

B00006LLNU|5.0|I hate to use the cliché, but words really can't describe this music.  This third release easily makes rank with their second.  Which to recommend to a first listener?  Get both since you'll want them all.  <br />You'd almost want to say this style represents a new genre of things to come.  It's only a matter of time before copycats try to emulate this sound, and I wish them well in trying.  This isn't \\"another one of those bands\\" whom a good producer could easily duplicate.  This outfit has talent, vision, originality, and have created albums with real staying power.
B0000027RL|5.0|Let me see, what words could I possibly use to describe this disc? Stellar, incredible, awesome, beautiful, deep, meaningful, rythmic, catchy... and so on and so on. Overflowing with raw emotion and anger. Here are the track grades and my top five favorite tracks.      1.Once=A=PJ's openers are usually pretty much the best tracks on the disc. This is no exception. Great song.      2.Even Flow=A+=My favorite song on the CD. Very good cathcy rythym, great lyrics, INCREDIBLE vocals by my idol, Eddie Vedder.      3.Alive=A-      4.Why Go=B+=Very good song about a girl commited to a mental hospital.      5.Black=B+      6.Jeremy=B+=Lots of bands have songs about school shooters, but PJ's is quite possibly the best, and most subtle.      7.Oceans=B+      8.Porch=A+=Incredible. Love the lyrics. And the music. Eddie gets right to the point and starts off by saying, what the f is this world?      9.Garden=A-      10.Deep=A-      11.Release=A-         1.Even Flow   2.Porch   3.Once   4.Why Go   5.Alive
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave just may be the force that can save rock and bring the music scene back to the meaningful and emotionally rich state that it has not known since the early 90s grunge period.  If this is the case, it would be the second time that the amazing Chris Cornell helped saved rock.  After all Soundgarden predates Nirvana as a fundamental part of the grunge movement, which purged rock of the disgrace known as hairmetal.  Audiosalve, however, shows potential to be greater than Soundgarden (or for that matter Rage Against the Machine) ever was.  It is a merging of what is, without a doubt, the best parts of the two bands.  Cornell's voice is certainly one of the best in rock history and Morello is an absolute genius whose riffwriting ability is compairable to that of Jimmy Page and whose exploration into new sounds with a guitar is remeniscent of Jimmy Hendrix. Of course the crisp, and tight rythm section cannot be overlooked. Brad Wilk and Tim Cummerford's flawless playing provide a solid backbone for Audioslave. <BR>     The Album is completely satisfying from beginning to end.  It is quite diverse and incredibly succesful in all the areas which it explores.  Hard rock anthems like Cochise and What you Are will make you just want to get up and scream along with Cornell while Ballads like Getaway Car and I Am the Highway are sure to move you.  Like a Stone and Shadow on the Sun are epic masterpieces which will have you grabbing for a lighter. Both of these two are adorned with quitar solos that are both stunning and groundbreaking. You won't soon find a better buy than this treasure so I recomend supporting the rebirth of true rock by buying one for yourself and one for a loved one right now!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Ok, this band's lyrics are intensly beautiful, yet at the same time quite ironic.  They are making a killing off of people buying the album that they clearly recommend stealing.  ...
B00006RU5B|1.0|Sweet mother of God, this is not what the members of post-Zack Rage Against the Machine should be doing. Don't take this personally, Soundgarden fans--Chris Cornell not only has the worst rock voice I've ever heard, he simply doesn't belong with the Rage musicians. I'm giving this thing a little credit because the instrumentalists are still blowing me away--but a guy like Cornell doesn't belong in Zack de la Rocha's honorable rapcore position. Period.
B000075BFK|5.0|Top album, probably the best of Tupac's work after his untimely death, (not including the 7 day theory album).  This album consists of 2pac songs from the \\"Makeveli era\\" of pac's life, which is probably the artists greatest period.  The tracks have been reproduced by some of todays hottest producers like 7, DJ Quick and regular Pac producers such as Johnny J.There are also some hot guests such as Nas, Tyrese, Mya and many more...  Overall I'd say to any pac fan this album is a MUST BUY, and to any rap fan it's definitly worth tha dollas!! Stand out tracks:When we ride, Thug mansion, Still ballin, but every track is hot so cop it!
0385508417|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed his writing, though I had grown tired of the &quot;lawyer theme.&quot;  A Painted House was a nice change; but this one brings out what I think is a rare talent -- writing humor.  I laughed out loud through this whole book.  My husband kept sticking his head in the room to say, &quot;I must ask Grisham to write more books like this!&quot;  It was a delightful weekend read and one that restored my spirit and still has me chuckling as I think about all the predicaments Luther created for himself.  It is funny and heartwarming and strikes close to the truth of many of the traditions we have all established.  When things get too frantic this season, take a few minutes to pick up this book and laugh long and loud!
6301978587|4.0|I love this movie and have watched it many time on my worn out copied-from-tv vhs tape. I'm not buying a new one until they bring it out on DVD! If companies can DVD all the JUNK that's out there, why can't they make a DVD of a great movie like this? It funny, sad, touching, and interesting. One of my favorites. L
B0000640VO|4.0|Simple: there's no French subtitle.  Although I don't speak French but my french speaking friend told me that the dialogues are a lot more than the simplified English translation.  Watching this movie makes me want to learn French and what better way to learn it than from learning what they are saying in Amelie?
0066214122|3.0|Although the book is interesting and well written, Prey has the same problems as Airframe and Timeline, it reads as a first draft. The impression left is as if this is a summary for the real book that would arrive later.<BR>The other problem with this book is that its premise has been used before. If you have seen John Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot; or if you read John Campbell's original short story then you already know the complete plot for the book, just change the site and change who is responsible for the virus, the destruction sequence is the same as in the movie.<BR> But even knowing all this the book is a good read and entertaining, just wait for the paperback
B00006M183|5.0|This album is a perfect five stars for fans who have enjoyed watching the evolution of the band through the years.  For casual fans it will take a few times through the CD until you can appreciate the depth of the album.  They give you a little of everything including a spoken word song and an Ed vocal jam (which is very cool).  Save You rocks (as anyone who saw the Letterman performance knows) and the last track is a flawless accoustic performance.  The band is coming dangerously close to perfecting their craft and I can't wait to see these songs live.  Don't get turned off by pre-conceived notions that the band is over the hill because you will be missing out on the most consistently innovative band of our generation.

B000077VPU|5.0|What can I say but this DVD is great. To see 72,000 people all clap in unison on RADIO GA GA, sing along with George Michael,Elton John, David Bowie and Annie Lenox with perfect pitch and phrasing just makes me miss Freddie all the more. Also, the fact that so many different types of singers steped into Freddie's shoe (or ballet slippers) is a statement to how diverse QUEEN's music is and how unique Freddie's writing and vocal talent was.

B000002ULO|5.0|I'm a George man first, but this effort from McCartney pushed its way into my CD changer and never left.  Historically, it got buried a little bit between the Anthology tsunami and Linda's passing, but the music itself stands with anything Paul has released in the last 20 years.<br />There are excellent rockers like \\"If You Wanna\\" (Steve Miller on guitar), \\"Young Boy\\" (James McCartney (!) on guitar), and the title track.<br />Linda would die less than a year after Flaming Pie's release, and that knowledge makes the acoustic 'Calico Skies' poignant and affecting.  It sounds very much like a good-bye, done in a beautiful, understated manner.
0812513495|5.0|I found Ender's Game not just a book, but an exhilarating rush through time to the future, where Earth is threatened by aliens called \\"buggers.\\" I loved this novel from cover to cover, not just because it is my favorite genre of literature, but because it contained and displayed elements of life: love, excitement, rivalry, bravery and danger, just to name a few. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience a book that you can't stop reading... and trust me, you won't want to.
0553277472|5.0|Read this if you are a searcher.  Read this if you've ever had a tinge of metaphysical questioning.  Read this if reality and waking existence amazes you when reflected upon.  Read this if you've ever been weary of &quot;it all&quot; and wondered what the point was.  Read this if eccentrics bother you.  Read this if intellectuals bother you.  Read this if you've yearned for a truly spiritual experience in vain.<br />I discovered this book 8 years ago and have been sure to read it at least once annually.  How this work has struck me can only be put cryptically at best.  <br />If ever this book has been recommended to you in passing and you have never found the time.  I urge you as I would urge you for no other book I have found so far.....FIND THE TIME AND KNOW THAT IT WILL CHANGE YOU
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin lit a flame under the far to complacent seat of the fantasy genre with the publication \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Mr. Martin relies on characterization and intricate plotting to craft a fully believable world that grabs one's attention and pulls one fully into the lives and loves of the many characters presented.   In this second book of the series Mr. Martin maintains both the pace of the plotting and adds new and vibrant characters to the story.  This is one of the most original fantasy series I have ever had the pleasure of reading.<br />Martin juggles several distinct storylines: one tale follows Jon Snow and the events in the north as winter approaches; another follows the battle for supremacy of the Seven Kingdoms between four would-be-kings and their armies; and the third tells of the fate of Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, a continent away. But three plotlines are not enough to contain Martin's vision.  There is the story of crippled Bran and his growing psychic abilities; his sister Sansa held hostage by the twisted boy King Joffrey and her continued abuse at the hands of the Lannisters.  There is Arya's struggle to return to Winterfell.  Minor characters from a \\"Game of Thrones\\" are brought to the forefront to provide even more depth and plot twists.  All these tales and dozens more are deftly interwoven to create a story about people not a story about the struggle of a few people to gain the throne of the Seven Kingdoms.  <br />The characters are never isolated form each other or their storylines.  Shifting from one viewpoint character to another not an uncommon way to tell a complex tale  but the trick is keeping the various story threads both interesting and interrelated.  Martin manages this trick like no other.  I appreciate the fact that viewpoint characters are present in the narratives of other's allowing us differing views of these fascinating people.  <br />The characters remain vibrant and intriguing.  Mr. Martinhas these characters, even the minor one's, change and grow as the story unfolds.  The lines between good and bad are blurred and no one in the book can be called truly good or truly bad.  There are characters that one loves to hate but given Mr. Martin's writing skills these characters will most likely change and cause us to reconsider them in a new light.  <br />In reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" I was swept away by the grandeur and completes of the world Mr. Martin created.  The series, I am told, is loosely based on the \\"War of the Roses\\" and the land itself bears great resemblance to the British islands of that era.  The only thing missing from \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was a Christian analogy.  Mr. Martin has corrected this with the introduction of the Red Woman and the cult of `the one true god'. The standard of the flaming heart is a dead giveaway to the connection.  With the Red Woman, comes magic which many reviews have noted for it's absence in \\"A Game of Thrones.\\" <br />The greatest accomplishment of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is Mr. Martin's refusal to shy away from the unpleasant and brutal realities of the world he has created, a world that in many ways closely resembles our Europe of the Middle Ages. Royal families dedicated to incest, lying and scheming courtiers, appalling abuses of women and the poor, ugly and wholly frightening scenes of battle and war.  There are no chivalrous knights and no innocent princesses to be found.  The gallant and honest don't survive and whatever innocence an individual possess is soon corrupted.  Mr. Martin doesn't skirt discreetly around the issues or images and the story is all the stronger for it.  <BR>Yes there is a long wait between books.  However I would rather wait patiently and have a superb book than to have a mediocre work shoved into my hands once a year like clockwork.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Forget the video. If you loved the theatrical version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; you won't want to miss the DVD. This special edition DVD has so many added features that fans of the film won't be satisfied until they own a copy.  This two-disc set includes 3 versions of the film. They include:<br />- The work-in-progress edition which first premiered at the 1991 New York Film Festival.<br />- The original theatrical version.<br />- A special edition version that includes the new musical number, &quot;Human Again&quot; and enhanced animation.<br />It also includes a sing-along track version, and a version of the film with audio commentary by the producers.<br />In addition, the second disc features behind-the-scenes galleries, interactive games, &quot;The Making of Beauty and the Beast,&quot; interviews with the cast-members, a tour of Disney's animation studios, music videos, and much, much more.<br />It's the familiar story of Belle, Maurice, Gaston, the Beast, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Cogsworth and Lumiere, but presented in a whole new way. Fans will not be disappointed. Restored and remastered, the film seems much brighter than the theatrical version.<br />The previous reviewer who complained of the Work-in-Progress version in French needs to familiarize him or herself to the operations of his or her DVD player. All versions of the film can be watched in a variety of languages, depending upon one's settings.<br />All in all, it's a perfect Christmas gift for the Beauty and the Beast fan.

0609610570|3.0|I would have to agree with a previous review that this book could be better. Bossidy and Ram, do not get into any type of detail on how to get things done. Bossidy must have more personal experiences he could have shared with us. The one-two punch with Larry and RAM doesn't work well at all. Solid concepts but lack of execution!
B000075BFK|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how one man had so much inside him.  He wanted to do so much for the poor and struggling black race.  Yet like any other person he often got lost trying to reach his destination.  He portrayed his journey in all his songs, writing from deep loving lyrics to battle lyrics.  This double CD includes a bit of everything, F*** 'Em All, When We Ride on Our Enemies, Catchin Feelins are classic battle raps.  Some of the deepest songs are My Block, Better Dayz, and Thugz Mansion where he explains how he wishes to have a future, a better time, and at the same time, to hang in there for better dayz.  With this new cd.. this indeed is a better day
B00005B36H|3.0|And I'm dead serious. This is not intelligent and fabulous, this is simply not quite good. Everyone reading this will probably I'm a proghater, a Toolhater or a numetalhater (although I don't even think Tool is numetal) but I'm not. I used to be a big fan. I considered Aenima the perfect album. The songs took seven minutes, sometimes longer but they didn't get boring. They always had hooks and were just amazing. Here, I miss the Tool feeling and, most importantly, I miss the songs! Missed chance for these lads.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I love this album, it reminds of filter only better.  The songs are mastered perfectly and everything is done to it's greatest extent.  I highly recomend you buy this aldum, it's worth the money.
B000001A3H|5.0|This was the third album I got from Kyuss, since I got em in wrong order (I started with ...and the circus). Therefore, it was strange at first. The production was...er...less. Hmm. The songs were...er...different. Damn. I actually didn't listen to it for a long time until suddenly one day, this song popped into my head. I couldn't remember whose song it was so I had to go through my CD collection - not a big job really, since I knew from many CD's it wouldn't be those. I ended up with a bunch of CD's from Fu Manchu, Kyuss, QOTSA and some more.<br />That is, you'd probably guessed, when I learned the song was 'Molten Universe' from this album. I listened to it, loved it and I still do. After all, the production wasn't THAT bad (I've heard worse and since I listen to Minor Threat alot, I'm used to it) and the songs were different, but good. Like it.

B000002KY8|5.0|The first three tracks form an electrifying sequence: from the pulsating 1999 through the rocking Little Red Corvette and into the hypnotic Delirious.The disturbingly prophetic words of 1999 gave me the chills but Little Red Corvette soon cured that, and halfway through the uplifting Delirious I was enraptured! This is a powerhouse song sequence, on a par with Donna Summer's legendary The Midnight Shift/Queen For A Day/Now I Need You on the original vinyl of her album Once Upon A Time.<br />Because of such gems, one tends to overlooked the fact that tracks like Let's Pretend We're Married and DMSR are brilliant too. Automatic is a long atmospheric piece with lovely female vocal and an impressive instrumental ending. Free is compelling in the interplay between Prince's falsetto and the backing vocals, another song loaded with meaning: \\"Be glad that U are free, free to change your mind/Free to go most anywhere anytime/Be glad that U are free, there's many a man who's not/So don't sleep until your guilty, cause sinners all are we/There are others doin' far worse than us/So be glad that you are free.\\" It's pure gospel, and a rousing number too.<br />Prince's music is such a seamless blend of so many styles, that it's hard to single out particular influences. But to me, on this album he's like a more urgent and full-bodied Chic! There's that same elegant tension in the beat, but Prince has eschewed Chic's minimalism for the full power of Rock and R&amp;B. This is very noticeable on the bouncy Lady Cab Driver, but elsewhere too.<br />Putting styles aside, 1999 is spectacular by any measure. The melodies, arrangements, lyrics, the playing and his voice all are superb, and the mix sets new standards in sonic perfection. I lost track of Prince's career the last decade but listening to this album again was pure joy.
0399103422|5.0|This is possibly the most entertaining Novel I have ever read. It charts the rise, fall and rise again of America's largest Mafia or Cosa Nostra Organisation.<br />Throught the Book are various sotries about different people who all have one person in common, their benifactor, their godfather Vito Corleone, a man of utmost honor and respect dispite being a murderer and extortionist. <br />The book starts with the Don at the hight of his power. After an assation attempt the Don's health becomes a cause for concern and now he must decide which of three sons will take contol of the family business.<br />Mario Puzo has constructed a compelling novel, although this is a big read I would recommend it for beginners or seasoned readers, an absolute classic
B000005ITX|5.0|This trippy album sounds as innovative now as it must have in the sixties when it was made. The music is weird and wonderful, but the exquisite melodies and the string and horn arrangements make the songs quite accessible, even catchy. As such, it's a happy marriage of folk (as in The Lovin' Spoonful) and psychedelia, blessed with poetic and sometimes charmingly quirky lyrics. Another comparison, albeit only partly valid, would be with Canadian singer Jane Siberry on some of her weirder excursions like Hockey or The Life Is The Red Wagon. My favorites includes the frisky Alone Again Or, the more serious The Red Telephone, the bizarre Live And Let Live and the contemplative You Set The Scene. This is a stimulating aural experience!
B00005ALP6|5.0|After seeing this musical many times on stage, I continue to enjoy the movie version.  Favorite songs (I Could Have Danced All Night, Get Me to the Church on Time, and others) leave me humming, singing, and dancing long after the movie is over.  Shaw's classical legend update, Pygmalion, may have been the seed for the story, and yet for those of us who love romance,My Fair Lady offers us the dazzling possibility of happiness.
B00007BK2N|4.0|Ever since I first got into DJing and the club scene, I have always known of the legendary Hacienda nightclub of Manchester. This movie is pretty much the history of that nightclub and it's founder, Tony Wilson. Actor Steve Coogan plays the role of Wilson as we see the rise and fall of his fame through both the Hacienda and his record label, Factory Records. What I also found fascinating about this movie is the portrayal of the origins of groups like Joy Division, New Order, and Happy Mondays. It gives a pretty good look at how the Manchester scene was back when Chicago was living it up with the Wharehouse, Music Box, and Power Plant. While I enjoyed the story and the comedic bits that director Michael Winterbottom and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce slipped into this, I can't see this movie appealing to anyone outside of independent movie buffs and/or nightlife history nuts like myself. I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing for anyone who liked movies like Groove or Trainspotting. I'll definitely get this on DVD when it comes out.
0689825498|5.0|I have six little ones from 10 to 2. They have all enjoyed this book and now the older ones read it to the younger one's. I found my two year old reading it to herself from memory. What a treasure!

B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, I love John Mayer! I hate to be one of those overly obsessed fans, but I think he's really great. His songs are pretty and unique. I haven't even bought this CD yet but I downloaded most of the songs. I don't think it's fair to compare him to Dave Matthews because he is very different if you care enough to listen. Everyone gets compared to someone else and, personally, I like John better! He seems like a really great guy and his songs are great to jam to or fall asleep to. Anyone who is dissing him needs to stop because he's better than you'll ever be! P.S. If anyone knows when he's coing back to Pittsburgh, tell me!
B000002B30|3.0|Advice to new fans: It will be much more rewarding to but Springsteen's original studio albums. I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, and there really isn't a bad cut on this album...but any Springsteen fan cannot deny that there are many, many &quot;hits&quot; missing. The new material recorded for the album is great stuff, but if this is supposed to be a greatest hits album, it should have included the obvious hits &quot;Cover Me&quot;, &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;, &quot;I'm Going Down&quot;, &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot;, &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;...the songs we hear on the radio...and maybe even an earlier cut like &quot;Growing Up&quot;, just for some pre-Born To Run material. Again, a fun listen, but it's a bit dissapointing considering this is likely to be the only Boss cd that a lot of people from my generation will ever own (I'm 23).
B00006LSM3|4.0|Let me be one to speak in defense of Jeff Lynne who does NOT flaw or ruin BRAINWASHED. Lynne's hand is not at all heavy here. His production input is remarkably restrained.  And, what do I think of George's songs? I rate them as follows:<br />Any Road - 8<BR>P2 Vatican Blues - 7.5<BR>Pisces Fish - 7<BR>Looking For My Life - 7.5<BR>Rising Sun - 9<BR>Marwa Blues - 9<BR>Stuck Inside A Cloud - 8<BR>Run So Far - 7<BR>Never Get Over You - 8<BR>Between The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea - 7<BR>Rocking Chair In Hawaii - 7<br />Brainwashed - 8<br />That's 7.75 out of 10 overall, and one of the best CDs to be released in a pretty uninteresting year in music...
0618002227|5.0|~If you were a Tolkien fan before the movie came out, I think rereading the series is worthwhile.  If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books.  I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again.  I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed.  The movie is good, but it is different from the novel.  Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading.  As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out.  Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.<br />This novel opens my imagination.  That is why I love Tolkien's work.  It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder.  I can feel myself in the journey.  Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen.  I am there.  The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination.  The nights before entering Moria.  The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels.  Tolkien's greatest gift to me, was the inspiration he has given my imagination.~
B00007E8V4|5.0|I love SOAD, man. It's plain and simple. I was really looking foward to this rarities album and was pleasantly surprised to find that it has all the punch and energy as both of their previous albums. The album is haunting, wicked, and evil, while being beautiful, melodic, angelic and hopeful. These vocals, these beats, these riffs. metal has never sounded more heavenly. Daron Malakian is god!!!

6305807086|2.0|This movie was so hyped, so built up, and it's just so mediocre. It has a bizarre idea and turns itself into a mockery of the craft of abstract movie making. It's so pretentious and stuffy, I want to gag myself with a pipe-cleaner. I like malkovich as usual, he's a very formidable and demanding presence, but other than that the movie blew. I was bored and apathetic by the closing ten minutes. May Spike Jonze succeed with his follow up Adaption.
B00006AG5N|4.0|I've never been a fan of Elvis Presley, and over the years, have often wondered why this man became a legend.  His voice is pretty average; his looks disintegrated with age; and his movies were, well, to put it mildly, pretty bad (with the exception of the excellent &quot;Flaming Star&quot;).  Still, one can't deny his electricity in his performances, and I guess that's why he's considered the King.  In this remastering of some of Elvis' biggest hits, we get a whole new perspective on the songs.  They sound alive again, and although purists may say it takes away from the appeal of the originals, I'm one of those who feels that if technology can enhance the original recording, it's better.  The drum rolls in &quot;Burning Love&quot; are still some of the most effective use of drums in that time; &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; still mnages to evoke those harsh images of being hurt by a lover; and the collection serves as a worthy tribute to a man whose legacy goes on and on.<BR>RECOMMENDED.
B00000GAIW|4.0|Regardless of what your opinions of Prog-Rock are, it's undeniable that Jethro Tull was an essential Prog innovator and integral albums like Aqualung did much to shape the sound of the experimental mid 70s scene.  Being a near perfect representation of the Prog-rock sound however, Aqualung experiences the same benefits and pitfalls as the grandiose genre itself making for an album that falls just short of being something truly great.  Boasting impressive musicianship throughout, the album alternates between lush, classically inspired acoustic passages and arena-esque electric guitar blasts that manage to capture all the mammoth power of 60s classic rock while still experimenting beyond the already cliched style.  Anderson's awe inspiring flute solos and the band's solid understanding of extended loud-soft dynamics makes for a continually interesting listen.  Unfortunately, the consistently strong songwriting is constantly underscored and often hurt by the much more poorly executed conceptual element of the album.  As was typical of Prog bands, Aqualung's themes are far too ambitious. Attempting to tackle religion, school, childhood, and life in general all within the span of about 60 minutes, Anderson's lyrics tend to be overly blunt and while he does make some good points about the problems of modern Catholic Dogma, Aqualung comes away with an utterly pretentious and not entirely cohesive message.  Furthermore, Anderson not only tries to cram his views on some of the biggest concepts in modern life into a single album, but also doesn't even truly start focusing on these topics until the album's second half leaving about a half hour to discuss the entire struggle between god and human. The song \\"Wind Up\\" then attempts to sum up all of Aqualung's massive concepts but the direct melodramatic tone of the song doesn't hold up well and leaves the listener on a sour note making the entire album seem a little less climactic.  Overall, Aqualung is a good collection of songsand accurately represents every detail of Jethro Tull's intricate sound, but while an album format may work well in getting rid of the band's distracting, flamboyant stage show, it also shows that the band was perhaps not accomplished enough in 1971 to undertake such a monumental feat.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton has been vastly successful financially but positive critical reviews of his works have been far and few.  Unfortunately, his latest novel Prey will probably not usher in waves of praise.  It is too bad because Crichton deals with issues that are pertinent to all people and his ideas are supported by relevant research.<br />Prey reads like an expanded movie script where action scenes have been fleshed out with perfunctory swiftness.  This book is disappointingly a second-rate effort when compared to his similarly themed, yet vastly superior Jurassic Park.  In that masterpiece, Crichton successfully evoked descriptive terror while entertaining the reader.  But in that work, people were able to rely on mental pictures of dinosaurs from childhood memories and such so Crichton didn't need to work as hard to deliver the frightening images.  Here, the menacing entities are nanoparticles - particles that are significantly smaller than the width of a human hair.  While these nanoparticles wreak havoc through predatory behavior, they still lack a cogent character.  While a future technology appears to be far more dangerous than say an extinct animal, the effort in making nanoparticles terrifying comes up short.  This may not be entirely Crichton's fault as nanotechnology is not as commonplace to people as genetic technologies and thus does not deliver the suspense that Crichton has so successfully conjured in novels past.<br />Jack Forman, the protagonist, is a stay-at-home father of three who was fired from his last job for blowing the whistle on his boss.  Fortunately for him, his wife Julia just happens to Vice President for Xymos Technologies, a secretive firm that is conducting hush-hush experiments in the Nevada desert when Jack is hastily hired to firefight some serious programming problems.  Meanwhile his wife inexplicably begins to exhibit indignant and strange behavior and upsetting the home-life balance that Jack has persevered to achieve.  Can there be some connection with her job or is this Crichton exploring the gender role reversal a la Disclosure?<br />The first third of the book sluggishly takes place mostly at Jack's home and here Crichton seems to be unable to find any pace in writing about domestic living.  For such a large chunk of text, the characters' dialogue is poorly written (especially the children's).   Crichton shines best when he exercises his wonderful gift of explaining abstract scientific concepts in layman's terms.  The passages about the nanotechnology, emergent behavior and biological terms make for interesting reading in sharp contrast to his domestic diatribe.<br />Prey is recommended for its ruminations on science but only if you can tolerate the prosaic passages about some of the characters' home life and mundane action scenes.  The bibliography at the end does provide an outstanding springboard learning about the scientific principles presented in the book.
0385474547|4.0|Chinua Achebe displays his commendable talent in the colorful and ironic tale Things Fall Apart.  This masterpiece introduces the unique characteristics of  African culture.  It begins with the periodical life of the African people centered around the strong and fearless character Okonkwo.  Through the description of his struggles in life, Achebe defines the many features of African rituals.  Achebe also  introduces the affects of clashing cultures.  Okonkwo, a strong and fearless man, is affected by the European's  domination over their culture, resulting in conflicts.  Okonkwo's life lead by his brave character simply falls apart.  Things Fall Apart is an excellent display of the negative results clashing civilizations have on the unrivaled and colorful rituals of cultures.

B00005JG6Q|5.0|Akira is most frequently designated as one of the seminal anime films, like 'Ghost in the Shell,' which have done much to define the potential of the Japanese genre.  By the making of this film, 'Akira' was already as very popular manga (by Katsuhiro Otomo).  Its theme is one that recurs frequently in anime, the good and the bad of human 'evolution.'<br />Neo Tokyo is Tokyo reborn on the ashes of the devastation of the next world war.  Set in 2019, the city is already large, crowded, and apparently thriving.  Yet, as you look at the details of this superbly animated film, it becomes obvious that something is seriously wrong.  Discontent has fueled a rising level of social violent, motorcycle gangs make war on the streets, and if one listens carefully, one hears rumors about 'Akira, a savior who wields tremendous powers.<br />Kanada and Tetsuo are bike gangers, friends since childhood.  When a conflict with the clown gang turns ultra-rough, Tetsuo is injured, just as the appearance of a child-like stranger brings the army down on everyone.  Tetsuo is carted off to a secret facility where the 'examinations' trigger the development of mental powers.  Enraged by years of powerlessness, and fury at his captors Tetsuo uses his powers to search for Akira, leaving a massive trail of destruction through Neo Tokyo.<br />Kanada, the authorities, and a mysterious group of children struggle to prevent the impending apocalypse, but it is clear from the beginning that nothing will be left unchanged in a demonstration of the risks of granting powers to those who are not ready for them<br />'Akira' is an example of the power of animation, so finely grained that, wherever the eye rests, there is something to consider.  While it still relies on non-stop action to carry it through, the characters, drawn from the dark side of the city are equally vivid.  Typical of anime, the film drops the viewer into a whirlwind with little or no preparation, but I don't really think the plot of the film is particularly hard to understand.  One simply needs to ride with the action, and things gradually become clear.ilm is particularly hard to understand.  One simply needs to ride with the action, and things gradually become clear.
0060005424|5.0|I loved this book. I want more. If you want to read a good sci-fi book, read this one, but read Sabriel first. Lireal is a book with suprising  twists and turns, with an ending leaving you wanting more, more, more!!
B00005Y7PS|5.0|This is one outstanding album;  every track is a classic. If you buy only one cd from Black Sabbath, this should be the one.
B000000OEI|5.0|Hans Zimmer catches the mood of this intense movie very powerfully in his music!  I would recommend this cd for anyone.  This is the cd that made me the fanatic Hans Zimmer fan that I am!  There is no way to be disappointed in this cd.
B00006G8LB|5.0|Toby Maquire is perfect in this role.  This movie had just the right amount of Superhero Action without being over dramatized or corny.  It was sensative and endearing.  Spiderman is a movie I could watch over and over!
0446530573|5.0|If you like the recipes in The Sopranos Family Cookbook, then I urge you to check out Michele Scicolone's other cookbooks such as Italian Holiday Cooking and The Antipasto Table. I have to give full disclosure here and say that I was Michele's editor, but her recipes are honest, delicious, and never fail to work.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is by far the best DVD ever made.  Pre-Concert footage, a full concert, music videos, multi-angle shots of a few songs, and there are a few solos by Sid (DJ) and Joey (drums) that are out of this world.  Maybe I'm biased because I'm a gigantic Slipknot freak - but this 2 DVD set is unbelievable.  The performance of Spit it Out is cool as hell, and if you've ever seen Slipknot in concert before (which I had) you'll realize how real this DVD is - it's exactly like being at the show!  The sound quality is amazing.  The only thing bad I can say about this is I wish they taped in in Denver instead of London so I could have been there for the taping.  BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!!!
B000066F6H|5.0|A mighty morsel, pop, and blast of better than pure punk. Like a quick rush of blood to the head, lifts you up and out in a blur. Slap this one on your list of favorite CDs before you buy it...reserve the spot. Point a laser beam of genius to an amp, and your explosion would be simply this...Veni Vidi Vicious!
B00006F7S4|3.0|I'm not feeling Beck's latest album Sea Change. If you have his last album Midnite Vultures, you'll know that the last song on there was the surprisingly smooth but still good \\"Debra\\". But ALL the songs on this album are mellow. Not only that, but they're all about the same thing: heartbreak, pain and self-pity (what is this, a Blu Cantrell album?). And on top of all THAT, all the songs drown into each other, making the album sound like one long single.<br />I know that a lot of artists are changing their style nowadays, but this album is missing all the things that make Beck Beck. There's no uncanny production, no wild sound effects, no mind-bending lyrics, no opportunities for you to get up and breakdance...in fact, there are NO fast songs. And next to the sad lyrics, the music is so dismal that it'll put you to sleep.<br />Maybe this album may have to grow on me in order to appreciate it (remember Mutations?). But as for right now, I'd only buy this album to complete my Beck collection.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Ask someone who knows movies to give you a list of the great comedies, and you can be sure that \\"Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" will come up in the top five at least.  It is a classic, and deservedly so.  Only Kubrick could have given us this screwball, slapstick, intelligent dark comedy about the end of the world.<br />Each frame is a memorable moment.  Each line is a classic.  Every actor puts in a career performance.  This bizarre  jewel is one of the best films ever made. Wacky fun, yet sharp and poignant.<br />This Special Edition DVD is a good set.  One disk only, aside from the director-approved cut of the film there are a couple of documentaries, a split-screen Peter Sellers/George C. Scott interview and the award-winning add campaign for the movie.<br />The documentaries are interesting.  They include interviews with friends and colleagues of Kubrick, as well as interviews with several people who worked on \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\"  There is obvious care that went into putting together this DVD.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra Streisand remains the greatest singer who ever lived. Just listen to the first few lines of the first song with Barry Manilow &quot;I have dreams, for you and me and wishes that last and live beyond eternity&quot; then &quot;as the years go by..I promise you that I....&quot; as Barbra sings these notes, these words these sentiments, listen carefully on the word &quot;by&quot; and the word &quot;I&quot; the one she holds for a few long seconds before Manilow joins her, her voice has remained ageless and evergreen. You will not find this clarity, this sublime beauty, this purity from any other singer now recording or from the past. What Barbra has is two talents, one she knows how to sing, she never tried to sound exactly the same in 63, as 73 or 83, or 2003, she grew and matured and expanded her voice and abilities and each of her recordings through the years added depth and dimension and showed off different parts of the female voice in its completely natural progression from a girls voices to a womans voice. Her other talent is that she can obviously stir emotion in a listner, I find it very difficult to believe that anyone who has ever recorded can sing Happy Days with Garland at 20 years old and totally blow you off your feet, then at 36 sing with Neil Diamond and again knock your socks off, then at then at 50 sing with Sinatra and sound like she shes still 20 and blwo you away all over again, then at 60 sing with Manilow and still sound so beautiful that you think there is just no way she can still be this great, but guess what the proof is in the pudding, each of the records on this CD and I do mean all can sit perfectly next to each other since they are of such a high level of excellence for what they each were trying to be or say or accomplish that once again leaves Barbra with the last laugh, so all you nay sayers complaining about compliations you really should be in awe of anyone who can cover such a range from Bryan Adams, To Garland, Dion, Summer,Sinatra, Manilow, Charles, Good Lord Barbra truly can sing anything and here she does. Buy this for all your friends and family they will love it. Once you hear One Less Bell you will never be able to listen to anyone sing that again.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera displays an emotional rollcoaster ride from start to finish with this album Stripped, which in my opinion is so much better than her debut effort. If you wanna dance listen to tracks like: Dirrty and Infatuation. If you wanna rock listen to tracks such as: Fighter, and Make Over, which is my favorite track on the album. There is also some emotional ballads here such as: Walkaway, Soar, Beautiful, Cruz, and I'm Okay. This album is packed with everything and anything anyone could possibly want in an album, and it sure does deliver to the fullest. Christina Aguilera breaks out of the teen pop star image, and into something that is a lot more mature. She is an artist now regardless of what anybody says. She sings her heart out, and packing the album with a massive 20 tracks helps too. This was well worth the 3 year wait, better than I expected actually. If you are in the mood to dance, think, or just be inspired Stripped is for you, and you'd be a fool not to buy it!
0385720920|4.0|Choke is a quick and entertaining read, which took me just a couple of days to get through.It was my first book by this author, and I was only aware of him through seeing the film Fight Club (which I didn't really like- I'm just not a Brad Pitt fan) -that being said, I found the book to be worthy of praise because it has an underlying philosophy to it, of basically creating your own reality, and not being programmed into robotic submission by society, or something like that. He is back in the land of 12 step meetings, and strange characters and stranger sex, but the whole book comes together at the end as the protagonist finds some kind of redemption. I am not sure I will read more of his work, but I am open to it - he gets four stars for inventing the term \\"dog and dice\\"
0783226888|5.0|Willis is great, what can I say, must of these reviewers most not like him! because this movie kicks [bottom]. Any Willis fan will love this. Gere and Poitier also are good in this film. The plot is good, easy to keep up with, but also makes you think, not many films can do that. This has a good blend of action and drama, When you have a cast like this one dose, you can't go wrong! oh and bruce is bad, he's a good \\"bad guy\\" i thank this is one of has only movie's were he is bad, well he was bad in The Siege(that is good to!).
B00006JUE2|5.0|Although this is not the most original theme for a movie, it works very well.<br />Jackman makes an amazing Leopold (all manners and grace) and Ryan is a wonderful strong exec in the movie, adding the so-sweet interior stuff. <br />The thing that worked in the movie was the clashing of ways of life. True, the time machine theme has been beaten down inccestantly, but how to fit in? That gives the movie the most hilarious moments and some fine performances by the two leads and all the secondary characters, especially Kate's brother and ex-boyfriend, who give the movie the salt.<br />A classy, brought-up gentleman and an independent woman of the 20th century find out that time is no barrier for love. Much like &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. Simply adorable.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Those of you who wish to be on the cutting edge of music want, no NEED, to check out this band! Leto and the boys are probably the best thing to happen to rock music since Kurt Cobain. Just think mid-ninety's alternative rock meets &quot;2001: a space odyssey&quot; meets cutting edge Incubus style sounds. A definite must buy for all rock fans. Space rock is definitly the new step for music and 30 seconds to mars is leading the way.

0066214122|4.0|Ever since I read THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN  shortly after its publication in 1969, I have been a Michael Crichton fan and have always eagerly awaited his next book. And PREY IS QUINTESSENTIAL MICHAEL CRICHTON, a story to tell and a message to get across. He begins with an introduction that discusses the recent advances in technology and warns of his concerns regarding their dangers. (Just as JURASSIC PARK was not only a great story, but a book about the possible abuses of cloning.)<br />Unfortunately, while I have enjoyed several of his recent works, in my estimation few of them, including this one, fulfill the promise of the his first novel. First, his recent books seem to be written primarily to become movies, in fact this one is almost indistinguishable from a film script. (And it could be a five star movie, but book readers need more detail and character development.) Second, as the review by Roger Buffington indicates, as I understand the technologies involved, the events in this story are highly improbable and some crucial developments go unexplained. (I cannot describe them in detail without giving away the plot.) Third, while the author attempted to clear up a lot of the loose ends in the final chapter, I found the conclusion to be relatively unsatisfactory.<br />The story opens with Jack Forman, an unemployed computer programmer and software engineer, playing the role of Mr. Mom while his wife Julia pursues her career at Xymos Technologies. She is a former venture capitalist turned corporate vp in charge of a top secret apparently \\"bet the company\\" project in which Xymos is engaged. The project involves biotechnolgy, nanotechnology, massively parallel computer processing systems and extensive software development of learning algorithms. As the project nears deadline, the pressure on Julia intensifies, and as their relationship deteriorates Jack suspects that she may be having an affair with someone at the company lab where she is spending an increasing amount of time. The project goes seriously awry, and Jack is called in as a consultant and soon learns the ominous truth. The machine has mutated and escaped from the lab and is acting as a lethal virus that has the potential not only to murder the lab employees but infect the human race. Nothing is as it first appears, and the race against time begins to halt the spread of the virus.<br />This is a true techno thriller and very fast paced. All the action takes place within seven days, and in fact in a very effective technique the chapter breaks consist of discrete rapidly moving time segments in sequential order. Thus, despite my reservations I found the book hard to put down until I had finished it, which is one of the reasons why I decided after much reflection it deserved as high as a four star rating. Also, the discussions of the technologies involved were quite interesting and well done. I am familiar in concept with several of them and found this part of the book very enjoyable. (However, if you are not scientifically literate, you will have to either skim them and accept the premises of the book or they will slow you down cosiderably.) Also, while the premise seemed implausible, once accepted the story was internally consistent.<br />The book suffered from two additional irritating flaws. First, several developments were well telegraphed to the reader, yet despite Jack's obvious intelligence and attention to detail he was oblivious to the implications of certain events and some of Julia's actions. Also the last chapter was a forced attempt to clear up some of the unexplained happenings, but seemed to be an afterthought addendum which still left several crucial things not cleared up to my satisfaction.<br />While I recommend this book with the aforementioned reservations, I would suggest that anyone interested in a serious discussion of the topic read the article by Bill Joy, the respected chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, which appeared in WIRED MAGAZINE a coupleof years ago about the dangers of technological innovations developing human like intelligence capabilities. At times as I was rading PREY it seemed as if that article had been the genesis of Michael Crichton's plot line. Also, if you are interested in a truly prescient sci fi story regarding the potential of self replicating machines, read the short story AUTOFAC by the great Philip K. Dick. (It is included in the collection titled MINORITY REPORT AND OTHER STORIES - the title story is a great classic and much better than the movie.) In conclusion, I believe that Michael Crichton's introduction to PREY indicates that he had a message that he wanted to convey (and his cautions are in fact well taken); nevertheless, while he developed the story in an entertaining and arresting manner, he stretched the technologies involved to do so and also ignored the historical evidence that technology and human ingenuity have much more often been the source of progress than disaster.
0060523794|2.0|It is strangely ironic that, after doing his best to suppress all negative communication within IBM, it should be the reader feedback on amazon.com that alerts Gerstner to what the world at large really thinks of him.  Ever since 1994 the newsreading public has been conned into a set of beliefs about IBM and Gerstner, simply through IBM's vice-like control of all media that wanted a share of IBM's ad spending.  It is bizarre that he expects us to read through a critical employee e-mail on pages 81-82 of his book, when he admits that he couldn't even spare the time to reply to it himself.<br />Gerstner was the IBM CEO with a worse revenue record than John Akers, the man he replaced.  The only way Gerstner could find to grow revenue was by buying firms like Lotus.  He turned what was a fantastic company to work for into a an ordinary one.  He writes in the book that he transformed the company into a firm where the most able got the most rewards.  In fact he converted it into a firm where the most aggressive individuals, like Gerstner, win through.  He destroyed IBM's employee benefits schemes across the world, claiming they were unaffordable at the time of IBM's darkest hour.  Perhaps they were at that time, but Gerstner's greatest sin was that he never returned any of the benefits to the employees when business improved, except through a silly bonus scheme that in my experience never motivated anyone.  The result is that IBM has become a company that people still want to have on their CV, but those who join in mid-career almost never stay more than two years.<br />Gerstner groped around and never really found the right idea for growing revenue.  His shift to services meant that he took his eye off all the products in the IBM catalogue, and IBM architectures have become an irrelevance in a world now dominated by Windows, TCP/IP, Linux, Solaris and Oracle.  He used the AS/400 as a cash cow when a very aggressive pricing scheme could have seen the system create the market that Windows NT instead built.  Gerstner has said the Internet saved IBM, but frankly it did a lot more for rivals like Microsoft and Sun.<br />There's a part of me that makes me think this book is one huge, ironic joke -- the guy only pretends to be unaware of the impact of his decisions on others.  He boasts about a turnaround that never was and advocates management behaviour that no-one should accept.<br />That would be fine if it were confined to the pages of this book.  But unfortunately the impact of Gerstner is written large across the lives of many, many individuals who crossed his path, both inside and outside IBM.  The blight cast over their lives means that, when they get the chance, they usually don't recommend IBM products.  Gerstner just doesn't understand that.<br />These pages on amazon ought to be required reading for anyone foolish enough to think they want a career in IBM.
B00005JG6R|2.0|Besides the impressive animation of the film (for its time), I did not enjoy this movie at all. Maybe its because I could not grasp the movie's concept. (????). Either way I recommend &quot;Lain&quot; over this!  What's up with the children who obviously suffer from<BR>progeria?  I don't get it!
B00006YXEK|5.0|I liked this CD from the first listen. The tracks that stand out for me are \\"Any Road\\", \\"Pisces Fish\\", and my favorite \\"Rising Sun\\". \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is terrific, especially since I've learned how much he loved the ukelele (from the McCartney Concert). I was afraid Jeff Lynne was going to over produce this, but the production is great. The enhanced edition is not so enhanced. The DVD is so short, but I love the guitar pick.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report was the best movie i saw this year,And it will become one of my favorites of all time.Steven Spielberg & Tom Cruise did an Exellent job here.This movie is full of action & Suspence!

B000057NVH|5.0|Type 4 accoustics. (four speaker surround) for a quadriphonic recording that was faithfully transferred to digital disc.  Much better than the Vinyl that dad used to have.<BR>It is a must for fans, or those experimenting with the genre.
B0000025HG|4.0|Wet is a very underrated album of Ms. Streisand's.  There are very strong ballads throughout but the album is almost ruined by the &quot;Splish Splash&quot; cut that sounds like it's from another album (a bad one).  It really jolts you out of the beautiful spell of the other ballads.  Still, it's quite a wonderful album.
B000066HHK|5.0|this is the music of linkin park when they were the band hybrid theory this cd is short just like any other Ep cd but this cd is great even if you arnt a big linkin park fan you should get this cd <br />1. Carousel<BR>2. Technique(like Cure for an itch)<BR>3. Step Up<BR>4. And One<BR>5. High Voltage<BR>6. Part of Me<br />A+ cd must by for any Linkin Park Fan
B000050FEN|5.0|This is a great movie to begin with, but the DVD set makes it even better. There's a whole second disc of in-depth stuff, including what the inside of the killer's notebooks look like. Getting the DVD set just for the second disc is definitely worth it.
B00005Q66T|1.0|when I heard that a second greatest hits album was coming out naturally I got all excited cause I thought being a madonna album it would be well worth having boy was I wrong!!!!<BR>for starters the songs seem to be all radio edited especially human nature and that ruined them also there was no new material and I thought she whould have included some remixes of Don't cry for me argentina(the miami mix) and Beautiful stanger cause those songs as they are.. are pretty boring so having listened to it a few times my disapointment just got worse so I went down to the secondhand CD shop and sold it I prefer to have the original albums then this album which seems like it was rushed and no real thought was put into it
0375420525|4.0|This is by far one of the weirdest books I have ever read, but it was worth it. I feel it ends a little suddenly, but Mark Z. Danielewski is an amazing writer the rest of the book, so I'll forgive him for that.
6305907145|5.0|As a woman who loves Jane Austen films, I knew I was going to like this film. But I was wrong. I loved it and would definately put it at the top of the best Austen adaptations. I use the term adaptation loosely since the film isn't exactly the same as the novel. It's better to think that the film used the Austen novel as a springboard. The story itself involves Fanny Price who goes to live at her rich relative's home at a young age. She becomes close with their son Edmund Bertram, and eventually grows to love him. But the arrival of the Crawford family seems to have made quite a mess of it. Edmund begins courting Mary Crawford, the older, worldly sister. Her brother Henry is attracted to the engaged Mariah Bertram, but eventually falls in love with Fanny. However, Fanny does not trust him and still longs for Edmund to return her love. It sounds like a soap opera but rises above this level because of it's wit and tantalizing characters. Frances O'Connor ('A.I.') and Jonny Lee Miller ('Trainspotting', very handsome) as Fanny and Edmund, share a boiling chemistry. Embeth Davidtz as Mary plays the part with obvious joy and zest. Alessandra Nivola as Henry also has the perfect mix of charm and danger about him. The direction is also marvelous with great period touches. The gorgeous English countryside becomes another character. Overall, it's not a great adaptation, but if you're like me and love period romance films, especially those with wit and charm, then see it, definately.
B000007ODM|5.0|\\"Ameno (Remix)\\" starts out with no music at all - just a male choir singing in latin. Before long though, female voices join in with the males to continue the album's flow of gradually climbing to a more powerful crescendo ... A solo female vocalist comes in next for a brief moment in the spotlight, and then a subtle beat begins to chime in, only to explode with an infectious Enigma-like dance beat. (Now if that doesn't draw you in, I don't know what will). . .<br /><br />The initial sound of Era is something that's very akin to Pilgrimage and Lesiem: Gregorian-type choral singing with the occassional electric guitar and english male/female rock vocal, which is the factor that evidently draws in comparisons to Enigma.<br /><br />I admit, Era does seem to be a bit over-hyped with boundless 5-star reviews, but as I sit here listening to this CD, pondering all of its possible faults, I come up empty-handed. Songs like \\"Mother\\" and \\"Enae Volare Mezzo\\" make this a very enjoyable album, and I highly recommend it to fans of classical-crossover, new age, and maybe even world music.
B00006LPK5|2.0|Simply Put, click to the next page and spend your money on something else!!!<BR>Poor writing, sad plot, this movie fails at everything they attempted (except the dragons they were cool)
B000002A46|5.0|This is simply the best Christmas album ever!  You'll definitely be put in the Christmas spirit by listening to it.  The original songs are just as great as the classics.  &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; is sure to be a classic in the future.  This album was released in 1994, so it was Mariah back when she was at her best (vocally and lyrically).  The best thing about this album is that Mariah doesn't try too hard to create a new sound with the traditional songs; she doesn't tamper with them and ruin them like some artists.  My favorites are &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; and &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;  I recommend this album to all Mariah fans (you must have it) and non-fans who love Christmas songs.  People of all ages will love it!
B000075BFK|5.0|This Tupac album is just what hip hop needed some real street rap.  When I heard this album was coming out I knew it would be a superior piece of work because pac has never let me down.  He always delivers the real true lyrics straight from his heart and tells the truth about what's going on in the hood.  I absolutely loved every single song on this album and I think that all pac fans should buy this album because you'll love it.  The lyrics on this album are as always sharp and meaningful and the beats are excellent.  This album is yet another reminder that if pac were still alive he would still be on top of rap.
0783225857|5.0|I read the book when I was a young man.  When the movie came out in 1962 or so, I paid my $.75 to see it on the silver screen.  Even though I was still pretty young, its brilliance was not lost on me.  It is simply one of the best books and movies that has been produced.  Period.  <BR>     Atticus is the focal character, but the story is told through the eyes of one of his children.  One can almost get lost in her voice as she tells how the small town of Maycomb came of age one summer and fall.  <BR>     The race relations that we struggle with today were being struggled with in those years depicted in this story.  Wonderful story-telling at its best.
0790729725|5.0|As a mobster movie fan, this is one of my all time favorites, next to the Godfather, of course.  This movie is based on the life of Henry Hill, a notorious mobster.  He starts off slow with small, petty crimes but quickly earns the trust of the higher ups.  All of the actors in this movie are excellent, especially Robert DeNiro.  If you like mob movies, you'll love this one.
B000065V9N|5.0|There isn't a better album that the 80s offered than Peter Gabriel's SO. Easily Gabriels most accessible album, SO, while it may have been commercially successful, still was and still is deep and innovative and artistically creative. The remastering makes the music sound sharper and better than the older version even though it was very well produced to begin with. In Your Eyes is sheer beauty, while Red Rain is a rainstorm of synthesizers, and Don't Give Up is stunningly beautiful. No pun intended towards Sledgehammer and Bif Time, but while they are great, I often skip them as I happen to love \\"That Voice Again\\"(Love the chord structure), the eerie \\"We Do What We're Told\\", and the sexually appealing \\"Mercy Street\\", WHOA! \\"SO\\" is a must have.
B00005JL2O|4.0|I've seen all of the Austin Powers movies, and this one I think is the funniest so far.  I laughed through the entire movie.  The hidden meanings and sexual innuendos are by far the funniest.  This movie will have you laughing so hard your stomach will hurt.

B000003TA4|5.0|In the wake of the release of the travesty of a greatest-hits package, it becomes apparent how essential this album really is.  Everything about it - from the music, performances, sequencing of the songs, and the packaging - is just about as perfect as one could hope.  <br />Look at the songs that were left off the greatest hits package:<br />1) BREED - As intense and corroded a riff as Cobain ever wrote, with lyrics documenting how much he doesn't care, but a performance proving how much he does.  A ... killer solo, too.<br />2) POLLY - The first ballad/acoustic performance the band ever did, insuring that the harrowing lyrics would take precedent over the roar of guitars.  An unflinching account of a brutal rape, told form the viewpoint of the perpetrator.  No less than Bob Dylan praised this song and Cobain's courage to include it on the album.<br />3) TERRITORIAL PISSINGS - Punk meltdown at its' funniest.<br />4) DRAIN YOU - Some of Cobain's most clever lyrics - \\"One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you\\", \\"I don't care what you think unless it's about me\\", etc.  Cobain had gone on to say that this was among his favorite compositions and was definitely as good if not better than Teen Spirit (I happen to disagree with this assessment, but it's still a great song).<br />5) LOUNGE ACT - Not the best perfomrnace of the band's career, and a fairly pedestrian chord sequence in the first place, but some great lyrics as Cobain vents out how for as much as he'd like to be able to fit in, he could never let \\"security\\" smother the \\"truth\\".  In light of his future suicide, the lyrics prove poignant.<br />6) STAY AWAY - Again, with lyrics like \\"I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool\\", disturbing foreshadowing for future events.<br />7) ON A PLAIN - One of my favorite songs on the album, and probably one of the druggiest bridges and melodies in punk.  (Ace lyric, \\"I got so high, I scratched till I bled\\")<br />8) SOMETHING IN THE WAY - A haunting performance, terrifying in its' calm gentle surface and its' lost and twisted lyrics.  This song would perpetuate Cobian's claim that for a time he lived beneath a bridge after being kicked out of his home.  Like Polly, proof that the band did not have to rely on sheer volume to get intensity across.<br />Throughout, Grohl's drumming proves how essential a great drummer is to any band, but especially one of Nirvana's caliber (the differecne between his drumming and Chad Channing on Bleach - I mean, different worlds.  Two totally seperate worlds.)  Butch Vig's production - though much maligned later by Cobain - brings the power of the band across in remarkable and innovative clarity.  Definitelty a different vibe from In Utero, but considering these songs are the poppiest in Cobain's catalog (you  can do the Monkey and the Hitchhiker to almost every song on this album!), more appropriate than the stark and raw Albini recorded later album.<br />This is an important album to have: would you settle for a Beatles greatest hits that includes \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La Da\\" or would you rather have the White Album?<br />EXACTLY.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This is such a fun, girlie movie.  For some reason, I really like these movies.. probably because there's no thought involved, just pure fun.<br />This movie is about a girl, Elle who decides to go to Harvard law because to try and win back her exboyfriend.  She discovers a few things about him and herself along the way.<br />Grab your gal pals for a fun and entertaining movie!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not an HBO subscriber but had heard good things about this mini-series so I decided to buy it when it came out on DVD.<BR>I watched it one time and I was hooked.  I'm not that interested in all the battle scenes but enjoyed the relationships between the men of Easy Company.  I think anybody would enjoy this DVD.  I liked it so much, I bought the VHS version for my father (who loves war movies).  I was surprised by all the unknown actors, they did a great job. I fell in love with Damian Lewis (Major Winters). I hope he makes a lot more movies!!
B00000HYXB|5.0|Most bands today are so mediocre-not these guys! This was my first purchase of BG. I will be buying more. Very worth giving a listen. Excellent musicianship and vocals. Really has me listening over and over. Buy this!
B00004XPP0|3.0|If you are as sick of pathetic,low-resolution VHS versions of the best movies,you DO have some alternative options. First,you can a used Laserdisc player for around [$$$] that blows the VHS versions away,the Trilogy usally sells for around [$$$] for all 3 Laserdiscs on E-bay,plus that Laserdisc player also comes in mighy handy for countless other films not out on DVD. Second,they are actually GOOD quality bootlegs (5-star collection) of the Trilogy on DVD,the ones i own include a 2.35:1 Widescreen letterbox (non-anamorphic) transfer mastered from the great Laserdiscs with DTS and DD 5.1 sound on dual-layered discs. The picture quality imo,is superior to the Laserdisc versions due to DVDs component video input and progressive scan. Show George Lucas what he is missing by going with one of these options and not supporting VHS,a DEAD technology.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't live in the United States, so this song hadn't been playing on the radio at all.  I heard the 30-second sample of Don't Know Why here on Amazon and bought the CD the next day.  Is this really supposed to be jazz?  It is definitely not the Britney-type of music, but should it be classified as jazz?  I really don't think she should be compared to the jazz vocalists either.  It is true that after the first track, all the songs sound similar, but they are not 'exactly the same' like someone described.  After a stressful day, you will find the songs really soothing but you wouldn't want to fall asleep because you'd want to be listening to her voice.  The volume of the music is just right so that her voice is highlighted, but not too loud - on other CDs sometimes the music is so loud that it drowns out the voice of the singer.<br />If you want something to psych you up, this is not the right music for you; but if you need to unwind, this would be the perfect CD.
0553106635|5.0|This was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It continues the story for the battle for the Iron Throne of Westeros. House Stark continues to fall to bad luck throughout this book, with betrayals and Lannisters barring them from succeeding, but in the end glory is found by the most &quot;unexpected&quot; of Starks. <BR>   Jon Snow's adventures in the north were increasingly exciting, as well, I found. <BR>   The end of this book does definitely not disappoint, and this book is a must-read for all Martin fans. A Storm of Swords introduces new types of fantastic magic and plot twists that one would neve suspect... until the end. And all the while the Others gather in the north...
B00006EXL5|5.0|This band is one of the most amazing bands i've ever had the pleasure to experience.  The Used had been my favorite band for quite awhile, but then the minute i played &quot;The Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot; I was awe-struck, and in love.  If i had to, i'd classify them as a hardcore emo, rock band.  They have pounding music, lovely vocals, and truly unique and awesome lyrics.  Obviously this is now my favorite band, and you should REALLY listen to them.  I think the best tracks are &quot;Cubicles&quot;, &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;, and &quot;Drowning Lessons&quot;.  Enjoy!
B000066NW0|4.0|No, Avril Lavigne is not a punk, and she is somewhat of a poseur, but I still liked this CD. I listened to it nonstop for the first few weeks after I bought it, and still do listen to it. It's not hard punk rock, but it has some great music on it with catchy lyrics that'll make you want to sing in the shower!
0767903854|4.0|I have to say that I have been a fan of Brysons for some time and hava always thought that he is an excellent author. This time he has done us proudagain with a interesting and in places thoughtful account of his journeyin Australia. interpersed in his travels are interesting titbits of history and geography of what sounds like a very interesting country what is really great about this book and in fact all his books is that he provides for all. he goes to very touristy places, but also to places in the outback that never really mentoned in other travel books about Australia. the only real critism i have of the book is the lack of infomation about the aborginies. he seems to skirt over the subject with small bits of infomation here and there but never anything solid. all in all this is a book that i would recommend to anyone interested in Australia at all.
6305537798|5.0|This movie is great, although a little unbelievable. The overused &quot;I was just a bet?!&quot; was, well, used again in this movie, but it didn't drag the plot down. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger offer amazing performances in this hilarious teen movie. Buy it today!
0066214122|3.0|(3 &amp; 1/2 stars) The best way to read a Crichton novel is to recognize up front that it is nothing more than popular entertainment.  Just surrender to it and go along for what will be a very enjoyable ride.  With Prey, as with other previous novels by this author, there is an exciting story that's mostly quick and easy reading.  As the cliched blurb quote says, it's a real page-turner.<br />The &quot;villain&quot; of the story is the nanoswarm, rendered in appropriately cool and menacing descriptions by Crichton.  The &quot;hero,&quot; Jack, is a fairly believable character as he gets deeper into the web of Xymos, the company making the nanoswarms.  As other reviewers have noted, the movie rights for Prey have already been sold, and it will translate well to the big screen (with a large SFX budget).<br />There are some flaws with Prey that caused me to give it a slightly lower rating.  The scientific explanations are sometimes boring, and distract from the narrative flow.  For example, try this passage which pops up right in the middle of Jack's first moments at the Xymos fabrication plant:  &quot;The technical definition of emergent behavior was behavior that occured in a group but was not programmed into any member of the group.  Emergent behavior could occur in any population, including a computer population.&quot;  That's just an excerpt from a page-long lecture.  Well, &quot;yawn...&quot;<br />The intro, another college lesson from Mr. Crichton, is something to skip -- especially since it repeats verbatim the same exact two quotes that begin the book!  There were also a few credibility gaps and holes in the story, but none serious enough to get in the way of the thrill ride of this made-for-Hollywood book.  It makes for a great afternoon or two of armchair escapism.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is by far the best record I've heard this year, and one of the best debuts that I've ever heard by any band.  For some reason, people love comparing these guys to a million other bands, but I think they surpass any simple comparisons; they have a sound of their own.  I can't wait to see what they'll do next. Check out this album ASAP, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Why is everyone trying to understand this movie? Think of it as eye candy or a dream, and like all dreams, they rarely make sense. Lynch took creative chances by casting lesser known actors for this project. Given how beautifully they pulled this off, I'm surprised I haven't seen them in other films. Of course, seeing Rebekah del Rio in the theater scene singing the Spanish version of &quot;Crying&quot; -- makes it worth every penny!

B00003CXI1|2.0|There are so many differences between the movie and book that the movie doesn't follow the book. It would be nice if some of the film followed the storyline of the book. They changed the book around so much that I'm not even sure that the movie is based on the same book I read so many times and enjoyed reading. The graphics were wonderfull but it doesn't diminish the fact that they couldn't bother to follow the book and the actions of the characters involved.

0553573403|5.0|I have read a great deal of books in my life, the majority of which have been in the Fantasy genre, and I can say without a doubt that A Game Of Thrones is the best Fantasy book I have ever read.  And possibly one of the best that I have read in any genre.  Martin is truly gifted; a Master of storytelling.  I cannot begin to say how much I loved this book, and how thankful I am to the friend who recommended it to me.<br />In A Game Of Thrones, Martin has woven a truly fascinating and extremely complex story.  At first I thought that it would be difficult to follow, and to keep everything straight.  There are a huge amount of characters, so many different locations, and plots within plots.  But it must be Martin's talent, in the way he writes, that makes everything come together naturally, and flow smoothly.  I've had no trouble at all with following the lives and adventures of all the characters.  Huzzah!  Brownie points to Martin.<br />Not only is there an incredible amount of world building going on here, but what I love most of all is the way Martin portrays his characters.  No one is either completely good or evil, they all have very complex personalities.  There is no black and white, only shades upon shades of gray.  And just when you think you've understood the way a character thinks, and what his actions will be, guess what?  You were wrong!  This book takes so many twists and turns, not only in character development, but in the storyline and plots, that it is always refreshing and exciting ... never a dull moment!<br />I am completely enthralled with this series!  I have just started the second book in the series, A Clash Of Kings, and so far the quality is right on par with the first one.  It picks up right where A Game Of Thrones left off, and does not go through pages or chapters of  unnecessary back-story ... thank goodness!  But for those of you who like that kind of thing in a series, don't worry.  This is one story that will be so vividly imprinted on your mind that you will not forget what has happened in the previous books.  Or at the very least, as soon as you begin reading again, it will all come flooding back.<br />This book was truly phenomenal.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves, or even just likes Fantasy.  In fact, I would even recommend it to people who have never even read Fantasy.  I had heard there wasn't much magic in these books, but was pleasantly surprised to see that there was more than I had expected, or at least a lot of references to magic or magical beings.  A wonderful set-up, and delightful teaser of what is to come I imagine.  Unlike other novels where the magic, and magical abilities, is `in your face', Martin takes a more subtle route and makes it all seem so real!  So believable!n your mind that you will not forget what has happened in the previous books.

B00002SSKI|5.0|This is one of the few films that seems to truly share real life and times of growing up for girls.  How great to share it with friends and family.  Great characters and a great story.  Kudos to the writer for giving us this story.  Watch it and enjoy.
0792151712|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best movies every made.  First of all, it is very close in terms of the historical facts.  The actual footage shown is simply amazing, and shows Jim Cameron's dedication to his craft.  <br />People say that they don't want to watch a film whose outcome is well known.  (The sinking.)  But Cameron has taken a tragic situation, and shown it to us, so we can learn, and grieve.  <br />The characters are wonderful, and the acting extraordinary.  Of course, there is no proof the actual characters existed, but they certainly could have, or something similar, and it was a brilliant showcase to the other real stories on the ship.<br />The actual technical details are a masterpiece.  No one could have cared more about this film than Cameron.  Five stars.
B00006IR5S|5.0|aunque en la pelicula no ocupan mucho el tema de &quot;Fawkes the phoenix&quot; (esa cancin me encanta mucho), el soundtrack esta muy bien, las canciones representan muy bien el objetivo, tal como el tema de &quot;The spiders&quot; de las araas esta genial o el del Dobby the house elf y se juntan muy bien...<BR>comprenlo, vale la pena, ca!

6302759110|5.0|This is the most decadent movie I've ever seen. It possesses huge amounts of every guilty pleasure you can think of: action, passion, adventure, battles, longing...you name it.<br />I was particularly enthralled by the love story between Mina and Dracula; I especially liked how they were reunited centuries later because Mina was the reincarnation of Dracula's lost love. I even bought the book in anticipation of reading about this fabulous love story; unfortunately, I discovered that this is the way in which the movie deviates from the novel. However, BSD is still very good and probably comes closer to the novel than any other movie has.<br />All the actors were great except for Keanu Reeves. I associate him so strongly with Bill and Ted and the whole air-guitar thing that I found it difficult to see him as the earnest, long-suffering Jonathan Harker.
B000075BFK|2.0|DONT GET FOOLED by all these other wak ... reviews. I've listioned to 2pac ever since day 1 and am one of his biggest fans. Every thing he has released up to this point has been gold but this is just DISSAPOINTING. I've downloaded 200 unlreleased Pac songs over the years and like Untill the end of time, I knew this would be a bunch of remixes. However these remixes dont cut it. Johhny J makes practicly no appearences and the best songs are the ones already released on death row compalations  - like, Who Do U Believe in and Late Night. Between Jazzy Jeffs numerous dissapointing appearences and a horrible song with Nas (ONE OF 2PACS ENEMIES) this albumn has production I would expect by some bootleg Neptunes producer - not 2pac style. The only EXCEPTABLE tracks are Still Ballin, Changed Man, F*** Em All, thugs mansion, and street fame. It's not worth the price of the CDs dont buy it, the original versions take this albumn out the game. Any real Pac fan will regret this albumn ever came out. Download a few songs. thats it.
6305971145|5.0|This is a great family movie. It begins with the story of Santa Clause, how he gets the job, and what his life is like. I describe the movie's view of the North Pole as how every child dreams it will be. It's a great flick. I've watched it since I was a child on an old copy and enjoy seeing it again each year. This DVD will keep the tradition going for years to come. It's a definant must see.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I am a huge fan of Christina and have loved her music since her debut in late 1999, but I must say that I am not really crazy about this album. For some reason, I feel that Christina's vocals are somewhat hidden in some of the songs. When I first heard it, I thought to myslef, this dosen't really sound like Christina. I think that some of the songs are too electronic and we don't really get to hear Christina's raw sound like on the first CD. The new electronic funk and hip hop sound seems to cover Christina's voice and is a little hard to hear in some songs. I think that the lyrics to these songs are fantastic because it really reveals Christina's thoughts and personal feelings, except for &quot;Dirrty&quot; which most people found a big disappointment. I liked Christina's first CD better because I felt like I could really hear her vocals more clearly than on this CD. The music on this CD could have been constructed a little better, but not a bad CD. This is definately a change for Christina, but I don't think her fans were expected such a different album. I still love Christina and this album was good but I think it could have been a little better as far as the music and the sound is concerned. The only songs I really like are &quot;Infatuation&quot; &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot; but not really crazy about the rest. Good CD though and I hope Christina continues to make more music. She has got an amazing voice and she is very talented and I hope she brings more good music into the world during her career.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Mick's performance on Monkey Man (and spectacular intro) was  never to be repeated live, as his voice soares into unknown skies. THE album's absolute gem has to be Keith Richard's You Got the Silver, which has to be one of the most amazingly touching and sensitive track he ever worked on, and where his voice is near to breaking and shattering as soon as he reaches the end note. Note that this is the last album including Brian Jones, who makes his last &quot;performance&quot; on a couple of tracks, including &quot;You got the silver&quot; and &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;. &quot;Love in Vain&quot; will persuade anyone into adoring blues music. Beautiful stuff. The album of a new phase in the Rolling Stones' history. A definite must in any record collection.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|I watched this movie on TV just because there wasn't anything else on.  But it is definitely a great movie.  I sobbed through the end of it, probably because I'm a dog lover, but I would definitely watch it again.  The producers don't dwell on sad events; instead, they concentrate on the beloved story of a kid and his adorable Jack Russell Terrier, Skip.  Even if you don't love dogs, you will fall in love with such a heartfelt, affectionate story.  You can see what a dog can mean to a person, and you, without even realizing it, feel for the dog and the boy.  It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I love this movie, and I would recommend anybody to see it.  The contents of the story are depressing to dog lovers, like myself, but are inspirational and encouraging to all.  However, if you are sensitive or love dogs, make sure you have tissues available.  But other than that it's a great movie and I would watch it again any day.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Although it doesn't have the scope or depth of Harrison's solo debut (All Things Must Pass although technically speaking Wonderwall was his first solo album), Brainwashed is one of the best solo albums Harrison made. The sad part is that he'll never be able to follow up on this terrific album. None of this is being said after looking through rose tinted glasses; the songs on Brainwashed are among his most accomplished and lyrically adept since ATMP, Living in the Material World and Cloud Nine).<br />Although finished by Jeff Lynne in collaboration with Dhani Harrison (they both added additional touches such as rhythm guitar overdubs, strings whether appropriate and backing vocals on some of the uncompleted tracks), Harrison's distinctive slide guitar playing and singing are never buried or obscured. Lynne and Dhani Harrison have lovingly applied their musical craft to finish this terrific album in a style that Harrison would have approved of (although Lynne does mention in the DVD included that Harrison might have thought the production touches a little too much and apologies by saying, \\"sorry George but they were such beautiful songs\\". They still are and, I don't doubt, that Harrison would have approved).<br />Lynne applies restraint with his production sound. While many have lamented Lynne's overproduction of Cloud Nine and Volume 1 &3 of the Traveling Wilbury albums, his production is a perfect compliment to George's songs. Remember, Harrison (like Lynne)was a hugh fan of Phil Spector and Spector's influence on Lynne is pretty pronounced. Brainwashed is a bit rougher around the edges (as George would have liked it based on his comments shortly before he died to Timothy White of Billboard Magazine). I'd have to disagree about there not being a strong single; Any Road certainly could occupy that niche. Yes, there's no strident rock tunes here (more mid-tempo)but that's Ok, too. It probably reflected George's mood given his condition and frame of mind.<br />This along with George's All Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine and Living in the Material World is among his best works. Paul's superb Driving Rain (in many ways, there are similar themes dealing with loss, change and spirituality)compliments George's final work.<br />It's as he never quit recording. Brainwashed sounds like the logical successor to Cloud Nine and the Wilbury albums. Harrison, Lynne and Dhani Harrison build an accomplished and tuneful musical ladder that allows George to climb to the top. When he gets up there he lets his playing speak for itself. Brainwashed features some of George's most affecting and powerful playing.<br />The opening track Any Road, Vatican Blues and Stuck Inside a Cloud (a personal fav of Dhani's, it's track number 7 as 7 was George's favorite number)are all outstanding. Harrison's collaboration with Jools Holland and his band on the standard Devil and the Deep Blue Sea isn't camped up. Harrison plays \\"uke\\" (as he and Dhani call it). Holland and his band give a nice swing texture to the track.<br />The magnum opus, though, is the title track. Brainwashed manages to roll all of Harrison's favorite topics into one. The use of sitar and other Indian musical textures both look back to Pepper and acknowledge that Harrison's affection for Ravi Shankar and Indian music was never a fad for George. It's a powerful 6 minute piece and still manages to end the album on a positive note.<br />George's tasteful slide playing is all over the album and reminds me what an accomplished and talented player he was. He may never of had the chops of Hendrix but his melodic flair always won the day. His solos were really designed to accent the song and not stand out on their own. Any Road may take you there, but George seemed to know exactly where he was going.ng with George's All Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine and Living in the Material World is among his best works.

He may never of had the chops of Hendrix but his melodic flair always won the day. His solos were really designed to accent the song and not stand out on their own. Any Road may take you there, but George seemed to know exactly where he was going.
0066620996|4.0|I vacillated over rating this book between a 4 and 5 star rating.  This book is very well conceived, researched, and ascribed throughout the book to Jim Collin's adept research team in Boulder.  I would love to be a `fly on the wall' to eavesdrop on the dialogue of the pertinent chapter deliverables.  I'm sure it was rewarding debates.<br />The reason, I allocated a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating was the editing foibles.  Although, this book was cogent to read, I think the editors missed some rudimentary diction and syntax errors.  It reads shoddy when a poignant author is left with choppy sentences.  I understand that this is trivial, but nonetheless, imperative for `Great' nonfiction reporting.<br />I recommend this book.  In addition, I suggest that you read the entire book including the FAQ's and criteria selection for Good to great and Comparison companies.  Halfway through the book, I was apprehensive that \\"Good to Great\\" was an arbitrary collage of companies that fared better than the general stock market and its competitor's.  These thoughts were dispelled and confirmed the authenticity of Collins's work through his team's statistical analysis.<br />However, the research is a tad prejudice, because of the criterion selection.  Namely, American companies selected from the Forbes 500 list.  It leaves me with a lingering question.....What entrenched characteristics do our European counterparts agree or disagree with in their search to propel its organizations from a `Good Company' to a \\"Great Company?\\"<br />\\"Good to Great,\\" is a very good compilation of successful companies that have made the leap from Good to Great.  Jim Collins's, \\"Built to Last\\" is equal in talent and a suggested referral.
0060523794|4.0|I picked up this book while at the Sydney airport, and I read it non-stop for the 7 hours' flight.<br />This book is very personal.  Only those who have ever been in IBM, or are still there can fully feel beyond the words.  I wouldn't call this a regular management book.  But if you want to know what separates a great leader, then this is the book.  <br />This book demonstrates how clearly Lou saw the issues.  Despite his effort, IBM is a big organization, and some of the same problems continue today.<br />Lou can claim a lot of credit for what IBM is today.  And most of us can see how far he has brought the organization.  What sets this book apart is that Lou is really writing from his gut.  In the book, he was unsparing about his feelings with various incidents, and revealed a person who not only has the business mind to turn this business around, but is passionate about it.  The last chapter is especially worth reading.
0140434135|4.0|This was my first Jane Austen novel, very much against the recommendation of others.  The novel does not paint detailed pictures, but the cleverness of Austen's wit is worth the read in itself.  I was disturbed in a one place where Austen broke the continuity of the story for a personal rant, but overall the subtly and intricacy of the plot was much more than I expected, and in the later half of the book I was particularly on edge.<br />I also think that this would be a good book for young people trying to understand relationships.  Austen very powerfully demonstrates the underlying manipulation and frivolity that so often accompanies young men and women.
1577311523|5.0|This is the best book I have EVER read. Period.<br />I've never written a review, but I had to chime in here. This amazing book is a plain-spoken how-to for living a sane life, free of misery. Why don't they teach this to children in schools? Why don't therapists know this? <br />Eckert Tolle's gentleness, clarity and intelligence shines forth from every page. Consistently, with every paragraph, he urges the reader to journey inside to discover the treasure that is our birthright - inner joy and peace.<br />If you are ready to drop drama from your life, if you've had enough suffering, if you would like to lessen the hold fear has on your way of being, perhaps \\"The Power of Now\\" will blow you away as it did me. <br />How many stars is that worth?
B000005S31|4.0|It's hard to objectively review a CD (or should I say album) that I had so much attachment to in college.  Being a big Lou Reed fan then, this album to me was clearly on par with Berlin and Transformer as soon as I heard it, yet it is so different than both of those efforts.<br />Definitely Reed's most &quot;accesible&quot; album, this is the one to own if you are not familiar with him.  His vocals seem to meld perfectly with the very economic instrumentations - the songs give the illusion of being very &quot;acoustic&quot; even though there is still a healthy dose of electric guitar present (think Mark Knopfler).<br />Emotionally a 5-star CD, but realistically not all the songs are up to that level.  I suppose 25 years has done something to musical tastes - there aren't as many kicks in &quot;Kicks&quot;, for example (a song about murdering for the thrill of it), and actually, the title track (Coney Island Baby) does sound a bit sappy now, as pretty as it is.  &quot;Ooohh Baby&quot; is a throw-away, and &quot;Nobody's Business&quot; is good, but not great.  The rest of the cuts ARE great (still today!), easily worth the price of the CD.
B00003CX9W|4.0|Let me start my saying that I only gave this DVD 4 Stars because of &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot;. It is the only entertaining part of this movie. There is some great music in it, but the animation is weird. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is great. They should put it on a single DVD by itself for me to buy. Good-bye.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|Pinocchio was Walt Disney's 2nd animated movie and 1st with the main character as a male. This movie was out 3 years after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The movie is about a puppet who wants to be a real boy. And his father also wants him to be a real boy. As the movie opens, a cricket named Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Ewards) comes to the home of a puppetmaster/maker Geppetto (Christian Rub) who is about to finish a puppet whom he names Pinocchio (Jones). And before going to see sleep that night Geppetto makes a wish that Pinocchio become a real boy. And a blue fairy shows up after Geppetto goes to sleep and brings Pinocchio to life. And tells him if he can prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish that one day he will become a real boy. She also tells Pinocchio that he has to know right from wrong. And dubs Jiminy as Pinocchio's conscience. And promises Jiminy that someday he may get a badge. When Pinocchio makes some noise he wakes up Geppetto and at first thinks he is dreaming. Pinocchio runs 88 minutes. To bad Disney put htis out of stock on 1/31/02. But look at the bright side, in about 10 years, Disney will re-release this movie.
0380977788|5.0|Gorgeously writen modern gothic fairy tale, markedly original, very satisfying to read and of the length at which Gaiman excels (see also his wonderful Smoke and Mirrors collection). For me his novels dont quite match up to his short stories/novellas.
B00000J6AG|5.0|As a new & improved Moby fan I will be glad to contemplate on my thoughts of this middle 1999 release. This touching, beautifully carved masterpiece is a disc that isn't to be forgotten in all the years you are to be buying CDs. There are many highlights of this album but some melodies that deserve an A+ from me are \\"Inside,\\" the relaxing instrumental, and \\"Porcelain,\\" the well-crafted, popular song. Many of these songs highlight this disc but a few run off track (\\"7\\") and that's about it! This is one of the best albums I own--and it will be getting a lot of attention from my CD player.<BR>Gains an A from me...<br />1) Honey--A quality song that opens well but the undistinctive lyrics of this \\"sample\\" make it a little less worthy listening. Grade: B<br />2) Find My Baby--Even though most of the grade goes to the infectious chorus (bravo!!) this IS a catchy song besides lack of lyrical talents (I wanna find my baby, woo! oh yes..) that will get stuck in your head. Grade: B<br />3) Porcelain--A wonderous song that does amazingly well on the album. Grade: A+<br />4) Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?--Amazing vocals go along with a good piano and a well-instrumentalized sample that supports the quantity of the song. Grade: B+<br />5) South Side--One of the most \\"pop\\" tracks on here with a little guitar-armed techno included with Gwen Stefani accompanying Moby's hardly-distinctive vocals. Grade: B<br />6) Rushing--A nice song but just rambles on for too long with a pretty piano accompanying the strange sample (all she seems to be saying is \\"hey yeah.\\") Grade: C<br />7) Bodyrock--A good, energetic track. Grade: B+<br />Will edit later...
B000005H3M|5.0|I have only resently become a Buddy fan and have loved all thing i have listened to of him. while i write this review im listening to the Big Swing Face album. i recomend it to anyone. All tunes are amazing. The tune Wack Wack is a must to listen to. The Norwegion Wood Arrangement,well,what can i say,i love it. Anyone and everyone will love this CD no matter who they are.
B000056V73|5.0|I thought that this movie provided a mixture of emotions which<BR>I think is very important in a movie.  It had very talented <BR>actors and actresses who played their roles perfectly.  Kate<BR>Hudson and Patrick Fugit were excellent and made the movie <BR>what it is.
6305728437|3.0|What could have made this, better is when this movie was getting edited, all the songs were deleted from the movie. The songs in this movie are not that good. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King all has much better songs than this. I mixed on this movie. Songs in this movie (* of *****) and the rest of the movie (*** of *****). As the movie opens, the emperor (Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita) orders one member of every family go to battle when trouble happens. And the emperor wants one man from every family to sign up. So when Mulan's (Mina-Na Wen) father signs up, she doesn't want him to. So she secrtly takes her father's place. And one her family finds out they prey to her ancester's that Mulan will be taken care of. So the ancesters send somebnody to watch over Mulan. And thier choice is a big dragon. And thier choice to wake him up is Mushu (Eddie Murphy). Mushu is not one of the ancester that watches of people, so when trouble happens he secretly takes the dragon's place. If you like Disney animated movies you might like this. Of course the songs are worth singing to.
B00006X06U|5.0|So Joni has elected to give us a sequel to her Both Sides Now orchestrated release of 2000. And yet this Travelogue twin CD gives us so much more than just a sequel or more of the same feeling. How so? By using only her own material she offers us a comprehensive view of the Lady as a Songwriter Nonpareil! Listen to that voice, at times so vulnerable and at other times so selfassured, always fitting the mood! Joni is at the height of her long career, and this can only terrify the rest of her pretenders out there because they will yet have to come near to  that unbeatable quality of poetry in the words to her songs. The orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza stress the underlying quality of Joni's compositions and if anything stress the feelings emanating from the original versions. Bravo, Joni! I shall not tire from listening to this superb masterwork!
B00005R23S|5.0|This is the DVD that turned me into a raving Springsteen fan. I was familiar with most of his hits, but unfamiliar with his stage performances and his overall approach to what he calls &quot;the ministry of Rock and Roll&quot;. Having seen the HBO special, I had no choice but to get the expanded DVD. <BR>     What a show! THis guy is 50 years old? The energy and passion he displays outshines most performers half his age. HIs band introductions during the song &quot;10th Avenue Freezeout&quot; were even entertaining. The Boss was in great voice, the band played brilliantly, and they managed to make a &quot;connection&quot; with the audience throughout the show. <BR>     If you've never seen the Boss live, this is your chance.
B000002C1V|5.0|Standing on its own merits and not rating it against other Floyd albums this is a powerful album.Despite the content the mood is mellow with a few upbeats thrown in. This album is best heard in its entirety and the best listening conditions are either with headphones or in your car.-Mortgageman
1558807381|5.0|I love anything Magickal/Mythical or Fantasy like so I absolutly loved this movie!!It has Unicorns,Faeries,Gnomes,Elves,Goblins and also a very young Tom Cruise.Take all that and add a very enchanting story to it and there's no way that you can go wrong! :)
B00005R87Q|3.0|And bad plot, and bad acting on both the main character's part. I really enjoyed the movie because of the stupid college-boy dialogue which really helped show that car movies aren't entertaining past car scenes. The car scenes were great, of course we all love seeing suped-up rice rockets and Supras, all being driven by macho testosterone-pumped pigs. <BR>Vin Diesel plays a bonehead who knows how to drive stick like a man, and Paul Walker plays a pansy who can't. Really I don't see how Paul Walker was supposed to be a break-out hit, given the casting of Walker and the weak dialogue...It is a rather important movie if you are a fan of action/driving films and want to be informed of the lowering quality of movies of that genre.
0736041850|5.0|Delavier has produced a simply beautiful work in \\"Strength Training Anatomy\\". The drawings are better than photo's for this type of work. They are clear and supported by numerous smaller illustrations that clarify the supporting structures and the movements themselves. How they published such a graphic intensive work at such a reasonable price is simply amazing (and beautiful...)
B00005NB8J|5.0|Seeing the theatic version of the movie over ten times and then seeing the extended version was a treat. It helps tie the story just a bit better. It helps understand a lot of nagging questions that the original gave me. I do recommend the SE to any Sci-Fi or Stargate fan.
0792151712|2.0|As was the case with the new version of Pearl Harbor, Titanic does NOTHING to honor those who actually did die abord the great vessel.  This film won best picture but I can guarantee you it was mostly due to the graphics that were, at the time, way beyond anything we'd seen before.<br />Leo is depressing. That's right, he's flat out depressing. I felt bad for him and the overacting job he does in this snooze fest. To think that Babwa Walwa's(also known as Barbara Walters) considered Leo one of \\"Hollywood's most powerful men!\\"  HA. The only thing powerful about Leo's perfomance in this film was his triumphant ability to make me fall asleep.  I tell you the truth, most of my incoherant, sleeping pill induced dreams possess more imagination than Titanic.<br />You want plot? Okay, in case you skipped Fourth Grade History or missed out on Common Knowledge 101, we have a big ship. It sinks, a bunch of people fall off like ping pong balls, and most of them die. Of course, we get to see a love triangle in the meantime and eventually witness poor Leo sacrificing everything - including his common sense - in order to save the one he loves. End of film. Sound nice? Well it is, if you like Chick Flicks and Leo. The only thing I liked about the fabricated portions of this film was the end where Leo meets the cold, harsh Atlantic Ocean and....well, I don't want to spoil it for you.<br />Buyer beware: this film is a complete and total chick flick. It spends over 80% of itself focusing on the love triangle and please note: it's perhaps the most nightmarish love triangle ever, excluding the one in Pearl Harbor of course. If that's not enough, you will hear Celine Deon(spelling) sing the song that made her what she is today! Oh, the humanity!!<br />I did give this film two stars because the ending is quite fascinating, especially the scene where the captain sees the water about to crash through his window. Nice effect!<br />Here's to peace, love, and small rafts that only hold one person after a ship sinks! :-)ne person after a ship sinks! :-)
0805062971|5.0|I contemplated writing a review on this CD for quite some time, trying to think best of how to say something good about Palahniuk's style that hadn't already been said. Really all I can say is, simply put, it is dramatic and witty. So far this is the only book I've read of Palahniuk's, but I must say if you are a fan of funny, dark, satirical, or satisfying-to-your-mind novels, then you will love this book. I did. So check it out, or if you can't get this book, check out Choke or Survivor.
B000000OU0|4.0|A nice mix of new material and fresh takes on older songs.  The guitar work on &quot;Hotel California&quot; gave me goosebumps.  Having also seen the DVD I was disappointed that the gorgeous, haunting acoustic live version of &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot; did not make it onto this otherwise lovely collection.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This movie is a must for a Sci-Fi fan. Not only do you get an original story (which is kinda rare in the genre these days) you also get a dose of Vin Diesel. It has many twists and turns that by the end you are definately satisfied.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|I'm still waiting for something coherant to happen.  It's as if all the plots in the world had been used and this film was all that was left. Good gracious people, couldn't Guy Pearce have at least gone and visited some REAL LIFE, fully functioning historical people? I think it would have been more interesting for him to go back and see the writing of the Mayflower Compact as opposed to this utter nonsense.<br />In this film, we get to witness Guy Pearce, usually a very credible actor(Memento, Count of Monte Cristo, LA Confidential), pull off one of his worse acting jobs since his first high school play - which might have been better than this junk.<br />(Right now, defenders of this film are saying, 'BUT it's such an amazing tale of adventue!').  Pardon me if I STRONGLY disagree. This film is the epitome of the modern day B-rated film. The main character(played by Pearce) loses his wife in a botched robbery attempt. He makes a time machine to go back and save her. It doesn't work. Instead, he eventually ends up in the distant future in a time where giant ape-looking men steal half naked Indian people and carry them off to their underground lair. Sound familiar? Yep, try a film compelation of Planet of the Apes, Water World, Escape from New York, The Sound of Music and, cha ching,  you've got The Time Machine.  Now, you might be saying, \\"Why would he throw in the Sound of Music, I liked that film!\\" Well, I did too, but to add it to the other three was just a simple point of emphasis as to how scattered and twisted this film really is.<br />I watched films for the sake of seeing if they're going to show me something new.  The Time Machine showed me nothing, except for the fact that it made my mind so tired and bewildered that it took me a half-hour just to cool back down.<br />Special DVD features? By the time this film ended, I didn't even bother checking them out. It would have been like someone shooting me in the foot and checking to see what kind of bullet they used. Buyer Beware.ey used. Buyer Beware.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I have loved this movie for over 15 years! It has all the qualitys of a classic! The fairy tale for teens. David Bowie is his ever over the top self
B00000DGUY|5.0|I hadn't heard much of Dire Straits before I got this CD, but I have a new appreciation for their music.  The soothing, haunting guitar and pensive lyrics hooked me immediately.  My favorite song in this collection is probably &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; because it puts an entirely new spin on an age-old story.  I was a little disgruntled when I discovered that this version of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; was edited, but overall the CD is wonderful.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna is the neatest artist of them all.  She is original, talented,and very beautiful. All of her songs rock!! Everyone needs to own her CD's. This one is my Favorite. Anyone who likes Madonna needs to own this CD!!
B000006TRV|3.0|O.K. We are all familiar with The Wall and have heard it played endlessly for twenty years now. Wouldn't you like to hear this music through fresh ears? How about if the songs from The Wall were played at a fast pace and on acoustic instruments? What if new arrangements set up the lyrics to make them clearer and more understandable than ever? Sound intriguing? Then check out Luther Wright and the Wrongs as they &quot;Rebuild the Wall.&quot; Released in 2002, &quot;Rebuild the Wall&quot; should appeal to fans of Pink Floyd's wall as well as to any lovers of good music.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I was initially and continue to be amazed by the computer animation in this film. I want to jump up and fly to Pixar studios to see how they do it. Every hair on Sulley' back moves independent of the others - or so it seems. The facial expressions of the characters are wonderful. Realistic emotions are played out on the faces of the monsters and the 2-year old human child &quot;boo&quot;. The characterization of the 2-year old child is right on target - take it from the mother of a 2-year old. I love it! My son's name is now &quot;boo&quot; in the house. Another interesting observation - to me - is that the child looks more animated than the monsters. Boo's characterization is great, but her &quot;look&quot; is more animated than the monsters - which doesn't detract from the movie at all. I'm just curious if that was deliberate?       The story is wonderful too. Even with the brilliant animation, this movie wouldn't be as wonderful as it is without the terrific story line, characters, and voices.      My favorite scene is when &quot;Boo&quot; overcomes her fear of Randall to save Sulley from falling out of a door. You've got to see it. I laugh out loud each and every time.
0788821075|5.0|This is an awesome movie! I love movies with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. They make a wonderful team! It all started with this movie. If you like this movie you will also like Runaway Bride. They are both just absolutely wonderful, romantic movies. My husband calls them girly kiss kiss movies...whatever they are they are awesome movies.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Another great Coen Brothers movie.  Jeff Bridges is \\"the dude\\", an itinerant slacker whose principal interests are bowling and smoking pot.  Comic hijinks ensue when the dude is mistaken by thugs for a wealthy scion who shares his name -- Lebowski.  John Goodman shines as Bridges' sidekick \\"Walter\\", a Vietnam vet who interprets everything that happens to him in terms of his Vietnam experience.<br />Super-high rewatchability makes owning this movie an easy decision.  <br />...by the same guys who did Fargo, Blood Simple, and Barton Fink.
0151006903|4.0|Good prose, fascinating characters, a dash of history, and a heaping of fantasy come together in this mind blowing novel recounting the lifelong quest of Baudolino, minister of Frederick Barbarossa and consummate liar.<br />People interested in the theology of early Christians will enjoy the last third of the book. In fact, come to think of it, some of the metaphysical musing is reminiscent of Hesse.<br />Overall, a great book.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Jack Black and Kyle Gass light it up on this f---ing great CD.  If you've listened to any of the live bootlegs of The D--this album totally does them justice and then some.  These guys are AWESOME!  Hooky songs, hysterical lyrics, and lots of expletives (if you're into that sort of thing).  In a nutshell, this album will, similar to your dad's old playboys and your mothers lingere (you know you've worn some of it), find a special place on your shelf and in your heart.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Where to even begin...... Firstly, I think whoever is in charge of making the executive decision to get all 9 beloved seasons on DVD and still has not done so should be deported to India with BaBoo Baut!! Seinfeld is undisputedly the greatest TV series ever made! My entire family adores the show.... my efforts, along with my mother and brother taped every single episode on VHS totalling 18 VHS tapes. I watch 2-3 episodes every night before I go to sleep!!<BR>     Now... I know what your thinking.... \\"if he has every episode on VHS, why is he so adimant about getting it put on DVD?!?\\" Well, I will tell you why!! First, the quality between DVD and VHS is like that of cassette tapes and CD's..... there simply is no comparison. VHS tapes eventually get worn and will not play any longer... the quality has already been substantially reduced from watching them so many times! Second, I have no idea what episode I am about to watch whereas if it was on DVD.... I could go right to whatever show I wanted to see!! And last and most certainly not least.... all of the great extras and bonus material they could put on the DVD collection!!<BR>     I have put a lot of thought into this and I would be willing to pay up to [$$$] for all 9 seasons of Seinfeld on DVD.... all 9 seasons... immortalized till the end of time so that all may see the best show ever made!!<BR>     Well, I think I have made my point.... get with it you white-collared pencil necks and release the greatest show ever on DVD!! I go into Best Buy and every crappy show on the planet is now on DVD from Malcolm in the Middle to Friends! Every great series is for some reason not being put on DVD?!? I would like to see not only Seinfeld on DVD, but also Curb Your Enthusiasm (every other mediocre show on HBO has been put on DVD),GI Joe complete series (Transformers has been released... what's the deal?!?), and the Spider-Man animated series from the early 90's (Spawn has been released and Spider-Man is popular again.... Serenity NOW!!!!)<BR>     Welp... I have said more than enough... if you agree with me... drop me an email to say hi... the seinfeld fanatics and true fans of good comedy need to unite!! <BR>Hooooocchhhiiiieeeeeeee MMMaaaaaammmmmmaaaaaaa!!<br />Sincerely,<BR>Jon ...
B000066NW0|4.0|Poser? Yes. Blamed for not fully writing her own lyrics? Probably. Self proclaims herself as 'punk' but really emerges as....well, this? Absolutely. But seriously people. Cool your jets! Point the finger, blame, whine, accuse------just chill. Just a bad start for young Avril. Times will change.<br />Grow up!!!!!!!!!!!! <BR>One reviewer is \\"writhing on the floor while blood squirts out the reviewers ears?\\" That is not only the dumbest and most immature thing I have ever heard, or the most  ridiculous, but what is so wrong with Sk8erboi? So the lyrics are bland and meaningless. The tunes are very appealing and friendly, and even  if you 'writh on the floor' (the thought of a human writhing on the floor while blood squirts out their ears is really creative) scream and kick, complain and whine, you can't deny its appeal. So all of you negatories---if it such a bad song, WHY are you listening to it in the first place?? !!!!! Go figure. <br />Sk8rboi is an OK song. My goodness. Some people these days are so<BR>HOT HEADED.....some bad lyrics, and music turns out to not be that punk and poof! Avril and her debut album is shoved into the garbage. Lyrics and image cannot be the only thing to judge by. Music is music. The music is catchy.<br />Bad/OK start...let her recoop and sort it all out. She'll do better next time.<BR>:)
B00006RU5B|5.0|strange and a bit odd to write down that sentence but Audioslave's self titled album is the album of my life,the music that changed everything.I never thought that I ever gonna hear such a great and soul filled music in my life again.My all time favourite album was Make yourself from Incubus but this one is the best I've ever heard.Why?I gonna tell you.The first song Cochise is only the gate to the world full of ghosts and feelings,if you only heard this song and say:&quot;Nothing new&quot; you make a big mistake couse this songs are simply perfect and embace the whole music scene itself.If you don't know this album you don't know anything about music.Chris Cornell's voice is filled with the pain of humanity and as you hear songs like &quot;I am the highway&quot; goosebumps begin to prickle your skin.I never ever felt this before,simply the PERFECT album,and I think the most important one of our decade.
0800177177|4.0|Francis Ford Copola has created a visual and audio masterpiece with this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.  The romantic element of this story resonates the loudest as the best adition to an already great story.  This component allows the viewer to understand Dracula better, and gain a sense of the hopeless languish he is forced to endure, until his heart is reguivenated by the presence of Mina, allowing the perfect delivery of one of the greatest romantic lines in cinematic history, &quot;I have crossed oceans of time to find you.&quot;  No one could have said it better.  Great movie!
B000003TAW|5.0|Just look at all the other reviews... 5 stars across the board.<br />Plainly put, the blue album is an american classic in it's own right. Rarely will you find a person who spent the better part of their life in the 90s who lacks this in their collection. Sure, Weezer were at their most heartfelt and musically excellent on Pinkerton, but the blue album's one of those records which possesses an intangible quality that makes it a must have for music fans.<br />Along with Nirvana's Nevermind, Alice in Chain's Dirt, and Rage Against the Machine's self title, &quot;Weezer&quot; helped define and shape alternative music in it's 90s hey day and continues to influence bands today. The melodies are simple, catchy, endearingly geeky yet tormented at the same time. Rivers Cuomo was (and maybe still is?) a master of guising pain and emotion with musical exuberance and Weezer rules.
B000059H98|4.0|An excitingly fun movie! Though the movies is slightly lacking in plot, there is enough action and color to go around. I am big fan of this film.
B00006LFGD|3.0|I loved the CD, however, the price of the CD is not worth it.  This stuff is previously released material except two new songs.  Let's get out of &quot;rehashing&quot; and get into new material for the right price.  Barbra, put that God-given voice to use in new material, don't waste it by rehashing the old material for profits for the record company and yourself.

B000067CPX|4.0|It is almost imposible to imagine a record by the chili peppers being outright beautiful. espesially when you consider where they have come from and what they have been through. a guitarist died, one left and almost died but came back and a drummer left camp because he thought he might be the next fatality if he stayed in the company of flea and keidis. <br />but here is an album which manages to mix the funk-rock-rap which made blood sugar sex magic one of the best rock records of the last ten years whilst coming up with someting that ows more to the beach boys than you could imagine. <br />the album opens with a pure blast of flea slapping bass funk but then retreats to the gorgeous guitar work of john fruciante which gives anthony a chance to really show of how good he is on vox and melody. his good friend michael stipe would be proud. <br />but in true peppers style, they know they have to play these songs live, they keep just enough spice in the album and the tunes that they don't drift to much from thier excellent back catalouge. and after seeing the live recently they really know how to put the live energy they are famouse for into the new songs on stage so they sit so well with the likes of suck my kiss and me and my friends. <br />if not for queens of the stone age and the often underestimated post vitalogy pearl jam, this would be the real flag waver of rock in 2002.

0671799320|4.0|The best thing I can say about \\"Prize\\" (other than the fact that I found it a fascinating read) is how it gave me a thorough sense of the complexities of matters I thought were simple and straightforward in the past.  I never knew of the serious macroeconomic, negative ramifications to having cheap gasoline at the pump.  The relationship between government policymakers and oil companies is not as simple as I had always assumed.  I was very surprised to learn of the historical discord that has existed among OPEC member nations.  There are many other examples of how my perspective has been broadened by reading this book.  <br />My one serious gripe about this book echoes a view expressed by another reviewer, namely that Yergin seems to say little that is negative about the oil industry.  I wanted to read more about how oil companies have related to the search for alternative fuels, specifically whether they have actively thwarted such efforts or not.  Nothing at all is mentioned about this.  The same can be similarly said about the wholly lacking coverage of how the industry relates to environmental concerns. More generally, in an industry so powerful and so awash in money and influence, it simply doesn't make sense that there aren't any patterns of abuse to recount. I've read elsewhere that Yergin is or has been a consultant to the oil industry, and it shows. <br />Four stars for being a fascinating and educational book.  Had it made even a token attempt to take a bit more of a balanced approach, it would have earned five.
B000002A46|5.0|This is by far the best Christmas album ever made.  Her renditions of \\"O Holy Night\\" and \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" are stunning.  It's the closest Mariah has come to doing a true gospel album.  The album is so good, I listen to it all-year long...in the middle of summer!  She sings these songs with such strength - the way they were meant to be.  I am confident that even people who aren't huge Mariah Carey fans would make an exception for this album.
0811826848|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is the sole source of all information about the Beatles you will need.  The four Beatles along with some of their closest associates contribute to this book.  It gives you a look from the inside of their life from each Beatle's early life all the way to the end of the group.  All aspects of their life are covered here.  This book is good for those fans who have heard one or two of their songs but want to learn more, all the way to those who think they know all about the fab four (they end up learning a lot more than they already knew!).  The pages have little titles on the bottom that tell you about the material on it (I.E. drugs, Yoko Ono, Revolver, The Phillipines, etc.) I got this book last February and I still haven't finished it.  I wish I had more time to read it; it is written very well.  It is a great gift for any Beatle fan.

0066214122|2.0|As a long time Crichton fan, I have waited for Prey with bated breath. Prey is a page turner, from the very first page. It's as exciting as it is fast moving. However, it is also an utter disappointment.<br />Nanotechnology as a subject has so much potential in the hands of a master of the technology thriller such as Crichton, but he completely fails to take advantage of it, so we end up with a book that reads more like a modern &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; rewrite than a Crichton technothriller. <br />Plot holes abound, particularly near the conclusion. Instead of the technothriller everyone was waiting for, we get a half way decent action movie script (and it's already been sold!). It's formulaic, and anyone with half a brain could already see the entire plot from the first chapter, leaving the work devoid of suspense.<br />All in all, a good read, but wait for the paper back.
B00005N9CV|5.0|If you're a Bossa Nova fan, you'll really appreciate this album. The smoky sultriness of Diana Krall's voice is hypnotic. The subtly samba take on everything from Jobim to Gershwin is intoxicating. Mix up your martinis and put this disc on.

What a dumb move.  This soundtrack [stinks]!  It would have sold 10 million copies with Biggie & Wutang on it.
0671024256|5.0|Stephen King has produced what I believe will long be considered one of the greatest instructional works on fiction writing. If you are an aspiring creative writer, there is no excuse - you need this book.<br />&quot;On Writing&quot; is divided into two sections. The first comprises a series of essays, relating everything from his childhood to the publication of Carrie. This is entertaining writing within and of itself, and really shows King's ability to engage a reader. In the second section King tells us what he's learned in a lifetime of being one of the world's top writers. This is what you're paying your money for.<br />Unlike the many other books of this sort I've read, &quot;On Writing&quot; doesn't pull any punches and isn't afraid to state it plainly. King has something that most other instructional writer's don't have - about 8 zillion sales to back up anything he writes - and therefore isn't afraid to tell us that &quot;the road to hell is paved with adverbs&quot; and &quot;it's impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad one.&quot; There are several examples given of both good and bad writing, laced with King's observations on many of the authors he has read over the years.<br />I can't recommend &quot;On Writing&quot; high enough. This line alone was worth the price of the book - &quot;...You must not come lightly to the page...&quot; - and it's only a fraction of the wisdom you're sure to encounter.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I guess my title above is my thought about her lastest album. Not so good, Not so bad, Just OK. <BR>Honestly, I'm sorry to say that to her fans, however, I think she is not such a talented, good and awesome singer. I daresay that there are bunch of people who can sing much better than her, even one of my buddies, she sings a song very well. <BR>I think, her voice is lack in somewhat the impression and basic skills even if she had been trained for a long time and technical skill to sing a song is good one. Thus, at first, I liked her because of her voice, but soon, I was getting little tired of her music, for my part.<BR>I think, the cool and awesome song is NEVER going to sick and tired of listening overtime, but rather make people want to listen again and again. <BR>On the other hand, I think her voice is sort of unique one. Not to mention whether her music is good or not, because I'd like to listen to some of her music.<BR>Anyhow, I think 3 stars are suitable for this album. Perhaps, most fans think she does not deserve to receive, but I think she has a long way to go to be a real brilliant musician. <BR>Anyway, she is young and has a lot of chances to ameliorate, so I do hope that, she is gonna show people the developed 4th album.
0066214122|3.0|Well, MC is allowed to write a so-so book every once in awhile - and this is it. If anything, I would normally be accused of going too easy on Crichton, since he's probably my favorite contemporary author. I've read all of his books, including the John Lange and Michael Douglas pseudonym novels, and I saw some uncharacteristic errors in \\"Prey.\\"<br />First, \\"Prey\\" is written in first person, and I don't particularly enjoy his first person writing (Case of Need, Rising Sun, etc.). It's not just a style preference - it actually stems from Crichton's intrinsic writing style. As any of his readers know, what makes his writing so amazing is his ability to seamlessly integrate in-depth research into fiction. However, the first person perspective naturally limits a writer's freedom to do this, and in Crichton's writing this tends to lead to awkward inner-reflections and cumbersome bursts of dialogue. While \\"Prey\\" manages this far better than say, \\"Rising Sun,\\" it still limits what is arguably the best reason for reading Crichton to begin with.<br />Second, this is the one novel where I would surrender to his more ardent critics that the \\"technology\\" portion of the novel competed with the plot. In past novels the unbelievably deep science has been woven into the story with amazing clarity, and the technology serves the story itself (Jurassic Park, Timeline). In \\"Prey,\\" however, I found in more than any other novel that Crichton was using a contrived and cookie-cutter plot as a soapbox to enlighten us on scientific ethics, in this case artificial intelligence. The plot is simple and in my opinion jaded - scientist screw up, release something bad into nature, it needs to be contained...I've already read \\"The Stand\\" and \\"Outbreak.\\" While Crichton normally takes the normal and elevates it to the sublime, in this case he didn't. The plot was nothing more than the obvious outcome of a given situation. The science was also much more complicated than in previous works and I would imagine the average reader will be lost throughout much of it, or at least struggling so hard to understand nanotechnology they'll miss the relevance to the story.<br />Third, the dialogue is off. Thinking back throughout his works, I realized that Crichton hasn't written many teenagers. This book shows us why. There are sections of the teenagers' dialogue that are literally embarrassing to read. Example: \\"...I'm trying Dad. But he is a majorly turkey butt.\\" \\"I am not! Up yours, weasel poop!\\" No it's not a typo - \\"a majorly turkey butt.\\" I don't know if Crichton (or his editor) has actually spoken to a teenager in the last 25 years, but in my experience no kids - nor any other human being I've ever known - actually talk like this. The teen dialogue is utterly unacceptable.<br />These are the major problems with the novel, and I feel it's at the bottom of Crichton's efforts. If you're a fan it's definitely worth reading, but for me it just didn't have that special thing that all his other novels have.<BR>-RDG
B000002BPS|5.0|I'm a hard-core music downloader and I haven't yet bought this CD since I haven't had time. But I've downloaded most of them, and I like them all. Gone Away is my definate favorite on this album, and is one of my two favorite Offspring songs of all time. It really shows how amazing Dexter Holland is as a vocalist, and there is real pain behind it, you can tell. I would give a lot to know what motivated its creation. I've downloaded all but four of these, including the disclaimer and intermission, so I'd have to give this probably a 12/14, and that's just because I haven't heard the two other songs. This'll probably be another Offspring cd that I can listen to all the way though and not have to skip once, unless the disclaimer and intermission are really annoying.
0375414053|5.0|This book can evoke hysterical laughter and tears - it is a compelling story that captures so many of the day to day struggles inherent for women who are mothers, career people, wives and daughters.

B00003CXCD|5.0|I wish this film was shot in technicolor to better enjoy the spendor that is Rome....however, the love story between these two fine actors makes up for the black and white presentation.  I am not a fan of old Hollywood classics but I must admit I was impressed with the ending of this film.  It was very well written and the story would never fly in today's Hollywood romantic comedies.  That makes it refreshing and a 5 star film!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Every song in this album was a song that I grew up too.  They were songs that made you feel good and carefree about life.  They were songs that made me daydream and drift off into a better place.  This is a classic cd that is needed in anyone's collection who likes classic rock at its finest.  With vocals from Stevie Nicks, Lindsy Buckingham and Christine McVie, how can you go wrong.

B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun, and it functioned as sublime escapism, which is probably why I've seen it as often as I have while realizing that the filmmakers tried to cram too much plot into the film and managed to cut short much of the heart needed to make the film a classic.<br />It was good enough, but it's not great cinema.

0441003257|5.0|God, this was intelligent. God, this was funny. God, this was well-plotted. God, this was the Apocalypse.<br />I suppose I should say more. Here goes:<br />Crowley, the snake who initially tempts Eve in the Garden of Eden, decides, along with the angel who initially watched over them, that the human race isn't all that bad. Though the Apocalypse is on them, complete with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding Harleys and a switched-at-birth Antichrist who doesn't realize that he's the Antichrist, perhaps the world shouldn't end after all.<br />Crowley is an intensely cool character, neither completely bad nor completely good. He takes his job of condemning souls to Hell not too seriously, for he realized a couple centuries ago that human beings faced with enough daily aggravations could condemn themselves.<br />The angel Arizaphale, I believe his name was, runs a bookstore collecting rare books and, most aptly, prophecy Bibles. (This and the footnotes in the book are the funniest, most \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" moments in it.) Arizaphale realized that human beings should be allowed to continue on in order to keep making art.<br />So the two team up with witches, parents and other veddy British personalities to save the world from its supposed end.<br />This is very funny.
B000001EL3|3.0|Destroyer was a hit in 1976 and Kiss became a huge rock band. <BR>The songwriting on this album isnt really special and many of the songs seem a bit forgettable and the lyrics often aim at young kids who are fustraded and cant stand living with their parents in the mid 70s. While we leave that aside I must comfess the production value is at its highest point. The producer Bob Ezrin i think outdid himself while creating this album. There is a lot of good things here such as strings and chorus and though i said earlier while the writing doesnt come up to pare some of the songs are indeed pretty good. but only some. Overall Ill give this album 3 stars out of 5 for catchy songs, good production and well a great cover and back photo.
0380977788|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" is excellent, a child's book that manages to be profoundly creepy in its illustrations and its verbal imagery. I'd never realized that buttons could be quite so scary, but to think that there's a mirror world out there and that all we have to do to join it forever is to sew buttons into our eyes frightened me in a way I thought was no longer possible.<br />I'm a huge Gaiman fan. Huge. This was better than NEVERWHERE and far darker than GOOD OMENS.
B0000025RI|3.0|This album is pretty good. It contains a lot of good dance and pop music and many tracks on this album became classic such as Billie Jean, Beat It and many moore. The production is also good which is one of the key element to the albums sucess not to mention the style and mind of Michael Jackson which after this album suffered something that I dont know what is but i think its serious. Though I Have said good things about Thriller many people may think its weird that I gave it just three stars. Well the song The Girl Is Mine is not a very good song. Thats the worst song on the album and there is some flaws with some of the songs on it. I also think that Thriller is a bit overrated I think its no wonder it so so many copies but I Do not think its deserve to be called a masterpiece because there is something on this album that is missing and I dont know what it is but I sure notice that when I have listened to it as a whole.
0374172897|5.0|The way the stories of the three women mirror one another, then intersect, is fascinating. I stayed up late one night determined to finish it once I realized that not only are these women connected by MRS. DALLOWAY and thematically through the search for meaning in their lives, they're perhaps connected physically as well. But that's giving too much away.<br />Clarissa Vaughn is getting flowers for a party honoring her friend Richard, who was once her lover but is now dying of AIDS. In going through her day, she wonders if her life, in the long run, has really mattered much to anyone. Her daughter seems embarassed by her. Young, politically-minded lesbians look at her calm, tension-free relationship with a woman somewhat derisively. She spent her life living for others, and now they're dying on her or departing.<br />Laura Brown, a '50s housewife, is coping with depression that seems to mount as she's attempting to make the perfect cake for her husband's birthday. What Laura really wants to do is withdraw from the world and read her copy of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" but convention is dictating what her life is supposed to mean to her. She's supposed to love the baby growing inside her, though she doesn't. She's supposed to love her marriage and son, but they are alien to her. She wants to be normal - yet she also wants the world to swallow her whole. She doesn't have a place where she feels she can be herself and belong.<br />Virginia Woolf, the writer of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" is going over plot points in her head while also trying to cope with the small choices she's made in her life. She's going slowly insane, as she has before, but, in her quest to hide it, she finds that she can't just be alone with her thoughts. Something is always expected of her, even by well-meaning friends.<br />Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" is a book that draws parallel from \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" but also delves into the questions surrounding what it means to be an individual and what it means to be alive. Through the different settings and times, he shows that, though many opportunities are afforded to the women as time passes, the key questions and issues remain constant.Through the different settings and times, he shows that, though many opportunities are afforded to the women as time passes, the key questions and issues remain constant.
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne debut Let Go is a collection of meaningless, boring songs.

0380789019|3.0|Another of Gaiman's compelling works, I read this one years ago.<br />This one is simply written, follows another tale of a world that mirrors our own, yet, despite two genuinely scary characters and a shocker of a villain at the end, the hero failed to gain my complete sympathy. Without that, I just didn't care which world he chose at the end.
B00006YXEK|3.0|Fortunately, although the Jeff Lynne touches are there, they are kept more in the background than in his earlier Harrison/Wilbury collaborations. The songwriting is good, and the production is decent. Low praise for a George Harrison CD. <br />Today, the news came out that George left $153 million in his will, mostly to Olivia and Dhani. So, he doesn't need your extra cash. Do the right thing: go buy the CD-only version of Brainwashed. As has been pointed out by other reviews, the extras are nearly nonexistent. What is a \\"George Harrison guitar pick,\\" anyway? Answer: A guitar pick that they printed George's name on. The poster is tiny, folded eight times over. Don't go to the kitchen, because the DVD will be finished by the time you return.<br />Just play the CD and enjoy the music. It's what George would have wanted, isn't it?

B00006RAKP|5.0|It's impossible to fit all of Elton John's hits from 1970-2002 into a two-disc compilation, even with the addition of a third bonus disc.  During the seventies, the songwriting team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin had the Midas touch.  Wisely, the first disc of this collection covers their heyday from 1970-1976.  The song selection is superb, balancing hit singles with essential album tracks.  \\"Your Song\\" was Elton's first hit and the obvious choice for starting this collection.  \\"Tiny Dancer\\" peaked at number 41 and, amazingly, \\"Candle In The Wind\\" wasn't even released as a single.  Being among two of Elton's best and most recognizable songs, they rightly appear on the first disc.  \\"Island Girl\\" is a lightweight song that is not well remembered, but was included because it hit number one on the charts!  On the other hand, Elton's excellent version of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" hit number one, but must have been excluded because it was a cover version of a Beatles' song.    Like the import CD \\"The Very Best Of Elton John,\\" the second disc starts off with Elton's number one song with Kiki Dee, \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart.\\"  Whereas that previous collection only went up to 1990, this disc goes up to 2001.  It's great to have \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\\" and \\"Circle Of Life\\" from the Lion King, as well as \\"Written In The Stars\\" from Aida, on an Elton John compilation.  However, I would have included them on the bonus disc to make room for other worthy songs from his regular albums, such as \\"Nobody Wins,\\" \\"Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)\\" and \\"Healing Hands,\\" to name a few.  The second disc closes out on a strong note with the two best songs from Elton's last album, namely the Lennonesque \\"I Want Love\\" and the autobiographical \\"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore.\\"    The limited edition, bonus disc is another reason for buying this collection.  It has Elton's live version of \\"Candle In The Wind,\\" which peaked at number 6, and his duet with George Michael on \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,\\" which hit number one.  \\"Live Like Horses\\" is an interesting curiosity, being a duet with Luciano Pavarotti.  The last song on the bonus disc was recorded in 2002.  It is Elton's duet with Alessandro Safina on \\"Your Song.\\"  Thus, Elton's greatest hits comes full circle, including an incredible selection of fantastic songs in-between the two versions of \\"Your Song.\\"

But trust me, its not too bad. The author's main goal was NOT to put down christianity, but to express how life should be lived honorably and to the fullest. The main character Lyra is a caring, trustworthy, stong, and loving girl who's actions are very \\"christian\\" in value. Only the most gullible of christians would be influenced to abandon their religion after reading this story. I dont recommend this trilogy to the close-minded!<br />This trilogy has and will continue to make a great impact on readers (IN A POSTITIVE WAY). The story of young love may jerk a few tears (as it did mine). Besides \\"Of Mice and Men\\" (when george has to shoot lenny) this was the only book that made me cry. This story makes ou ponder abot life also. i first read this book during some \\"dark times\\". it made me realize that life is to be lived to the fullest and cherished. we only have a short time to live, so we might as well make it memorable.

0060194995|5.0|The world of the 1930's southern culture is revealed to us in To Kill a Mockingbird, as seen through the eyes of a young girl named Jean Louis Finch, known as Scout.  This book tells the story about Scout and her brother Jem learning lessons about compassion and fairness.  Prejudice is the main theme of this book.  Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, the story's narrator, is a lawyer assigned to defend a black man falsely accused of rape. Atticus is a tolerant man who has raised his children to do their best to consider all points of view. Over the span of three years, Scout, gives us a first-hand view of how the townspeople in Maycomb, Alabama behave toward people of different races and classes in the town.  Scout's experiences with the people of Maycomb teach her to consider their points of view in addition to her own.  At her young age she begins to understand the daily life of many of Maycomb's residents backgrounds better than most of the adults. When she confronts Mr. Cunningham and the other men at the jail, she is able to reach them by showing their connections to each other.  Scout tells the story in her own words, but her analysis of the people and their actions are with the point of view of an adult.  She understands what the sheriff is doing when he declares that Bob Ewell has fallen on his own knife, and she also realizes that Boo has been their unseen friend and protector throughout, and should be treated respectfully.  Harper Lee does a good job portraying prejudices in the post depression South. It is a novel worth reading again and again.

Lee, Daniels and Beringer turn in career performances as opposing commanders asked to do the impossible while the fates of their armies-and countries-hang in the balance. Unfortunately for each side, the line-against-line battle tactics (dating to the hoplite phalanxes of ancient Greece) lagged decades behind the period's lethal weaponry. All the gallantry in the world doesn't go much good when a minie ball is twirling toward your chest. Throughout the conflict, the generals ask each other, \\"Is this good ground?\\" Thanks to their men, it is now.

Well here are a few reasons from the Ragin' Cajun herself:<br />1)  Legolas is in it!<BR>2)  The characters don't change their style, looks, or behavior because TTT was shot right after FOTR!<BR>3)  All three movies were shot very true to the book.<BR>4)  And finally, LEGOLAS IS IN IT!!!  :-)<br />December 18th!

6304595247|1.0|I'm sorry to go against the flow on this one, but I have to say that this is probably one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through.<br />To say that Ralph Fiennes was monumentally miscast is understating the case.  To be fair, he does his best, but never stands a chance.  Physically, emotionally and technically he's out of his league.  He's a very fine actor in the right role, but this isn't it.  He never really gets to grips with Heathcliff's complexities, and ends up looking just bad-tempered and greasy.<br />Juliette Binoche fares little better, hampered by a French accent and an imperfect grasp of English, she's totally at sea.<br />Filming the whole book was laudable, but it just doesn't work.  Peter Kosminsky seemed to have little grasp of his source material and no feel at all for the atmosphere of the novel.  <br />Using Wharfedale as a location might have seemed like a good idea - and it IS spectacular scenery, but it's all wrong for the subject.  Those aren't moors.  Emily Bronte didn't set Wuthering Heights in North Yorkshire's limestone pavement country.  Likewise, Ryuichi Sakamoto's music is beautiful - but equally wrong.<br />Don't waste your money on this.  If you want a faithful and attention-holding version - seek out the 1998 Robert Cavanah/Orla Brady one.  It's in a different class entirely.
0345298349|5.0|I've always been a great fan of detective, spy and Cold War novels. This book brings out the best of all 3 worlds, but unlike so many American Cold War novels, Smith looks at the three dead bodies in Gorky Park and beyond (and out of Moscow to New York City) through the eyes of the main character--detective Arkardy Renko, a cynical Ukrainian who works hard at his job with honesty and with conviction in Moscow--and not some unkillable CIA hero. The story is filled with intrigue, cunning plot twists and wonderfully-crafted characters.
B00005JKCH|5.0|That's the bottom line ... Spider-Man is the best of all the super-hero movies to have come out.  One of the key reasons is the writers did not spend way too much time on the hero's origin.  This is the downfall of the first movie of any character.  They hit the key elements -- bit by a spider, realizes his powers, his inaction results in a dire consequence (no spoiler here), and he goes on to become Spider-Man.  Peter Parker's enchantment with Mary Jane Watson is handled well -- the teen-age angst with the beautiful girl and rivals who are bigger, stronger, and richer.  All of the plot points come to a head and are resolved through the film.  Spider-Man is not my favorite super-hero but this is definitely the best film.
0060976624|5.0|As a person who used to do what these characters do, I have to admit I laughed out loud as I blushed.  The shameless and never-ending spin Buckley wrote about in _Thank You for Smoking_ was a painful - and probably inadvertent - prediction of what we've reduced public policy to in the last decade.  Although I'm not as fond of Buckley's other novels, this book receives my highest honor: I buy it over and over again because I'm constantly loaning it to to people who never get it back.
B00006NSGX|2.0|I won't deny it. I'm a Clapton fanatic and have been for 4 decades. I've seen more Clapton shows than I can remember. This collection, however, is not even indicitive of what the man can do. Sure, he sings great, but he also yields the reigns over to the keybords too much in addition to rendering stiff versions of old favorites. But it's not Clapton so much as it's the band that undermines this title. Layla is leaden, Sunshine of Your Love doesn't swing at all and Cocaine is plodding. The main reason for these really stiff and lazily rendered &quot;Vegas Clapton&quot; tunes is, I feel, Steve Gadd. A great musician, one of the best ever. But he's just not a rock drummer in the same vein as, say, Phil Collins or even Ringo. 'Reptile' on disc 1 illustrates what Gadd does best. Laid back and just right. And it works here just fine. But the rest of it? NOT! Back in the early 80's, Clapton fired his band of English studio players citing that they were 'too perfect' and 'lacked a feel for the music'. This is also the case here. Too competent, too clean, too straight and very boring.  Get 'Live at the Fillmore&quot; or 'Crossroads II' or 'George Harrison Live in Japan' to hear the real deal. Too bad you can't just buy disc 1 of 'One More Car...' by itself. At least the master isn't being led by the band on most of these tunes. Otherwise this collection is EC on auto pilot.
0066214122|2.0|As with all of Crichton's work, this one is extremely well researched, and makes some complicated and rather futuristic science accessible to a broader range of the public.  It also conveys the reader along its suspenseful plot with eager turns of the page (you'll be able to turn through this one during a typical flight).  However, it's also characteristic of Crichton's recent novels - pedantic, almost as if it's written for imbeciles, leaving no suspense except to find out what's going to _happen_ next - rather than what the characters (and readers) are going to _learn_ next.  I don't think the first person narrative helps with this problem.<br />For people who have done absolutely no reading about emergent systems, biological models for technology, or nanotechnology, this book may be a good primer.  (Though I believe it needed a stronger editor, I prefer Neal Stephenson's _The Diamond Age_ as a more prophetic vision of the dangers of nanotechnology.)  Crichton's _Prey_ treats its readers as if they're not smart enough to put together some pretty obvious connections, and then strays off its solid science to a rather frivolous - and painfully, incessantly telegraphed - fright for an ending.<br />As with his dinosaur books, Crichton appears to be writing a screenplay rather than a novel.  And, frankly, _West World_ and the terrifically underrated _Looker_ and _Runaway_ were much better examples of his skill in that arena.  For readers interested in well written and solidly plotted science thrillers, I'd recommend Crichton's earlier work, such as _The Andromeda Strain_ and _The Terminal Man_, or Neal Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_.
B00006LFGD|5.0|If you are a casual Streisand fan with few of her albums in your collection, DUETS, like THE ESSENTIAL BARBRA STREISAND before it, is perfect for you.<br />The tracks that are the biggest treats here are those that haven't been released multiple times before.  Obivously that would include the two new &quot;pop&quot; tracks, featuring Barry Manilow and Josh Groban.  Of the two, the Groban track is stronger.  Barbra's never sung with a male voice of Groban's caliber, and while the song itself is no great shakes, their voices together are a beautiful combination.<br />Other highlights and welcome inclusions include the stellar 1971 duet with herself on &quot;One Less Bell To Answer / A House Is Not A Home,&quot; her duets with musical giants Judy Garland, Harold Arlen, Ray Charles, Johnny Mathis (which should have been a big adult contemporary hit but wasn't) and Frank Sinatra, taken from his album release of the same name.   Of special mention is her &quot;power 80's&quot; ballad with Kim Carnes, the under-rated &quot;Make No Mistake, He's Mine.&quot;<br />If you enjoy Streisand, you will enjoy this album.

6305282927|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  If you are into watching musicals or classical movies, this is a MUST see!
B00000DFSK|4.0|For the casual fan, this is a fairly good collection of U2 singles from the 1980s.  If you would like to explore this era further, I recommend the following records (in order of priority):  (1) 'The Joshua Tree' (1987); (2) 'Under a Blood Red Sky' (1983); (3) 'Rattle &amp; Hum' (1988); (4) 'War' (1983); and (5) 'The Unforgettable Fire' (1984).<br />For the diehard fans, it should be noted that there are a few glaring omissions here (see &quot;*&quot; below), including no singles from 'October' (1981) (only the hidden track at the very end - &quot;October&quot;).  Second, with this running order, the songs don't seem to fit together.  That said, I would have included the following (in roughly chronological order, which sounds suprisingly coherent):<BR>*1. &quot;11 'O Clock Tick Tock&quot; (4:30)<BR>2. &quot;I Will Follow&quot; (3:31)<BR>*3. &quot;Gloria&quot; (4:13)<BR>4. &quot;New Year's Day&quot; (5:38)<BR>*5. &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; (4:03)<BR>6. &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (4:38)<BR>7. &quot;Pride (in the Name of Love)&quot; (3:51)<BR>8. &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; (4:56)<BR>9. &quot;Bad&quot; (5:50)<BR>10. &quot;With or Without You&quot; (4:56)<BR>11. &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; (4:37)<BR>12. &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; (5:36)<BR>*13. &quot;In God's Country&quot; (2:57)<BR>14. &quot;Desire&quot; (2:58)<BR>15. &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; (3:31)<BR>16. &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; (4:17)<BR>17. &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; [Single Edit] (4:40)<BR>18. &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; [Single Mix] (3:03)<br />All of these songs would have fit on a single CD (clocking in at less than 78 minutes) and would have represented a more comprehensive and coherent compilation of the 1980s.  Those tracks added would be gems like the pre-LP 1980 single &quot;11 'O Clock Tick Tock&quot; (which was included in the live set throughout the 1980s), &quot;Gloria&quot; (the best single from the 'October'), &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; (one of their best early pop songs from 'War'), and 'In God's Country' (a successful single from 'The Joshua Tree' and a nice segway into 'Rattle &amp; Hum' material, which was so acutely inspired by American music).
0792842073|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  A true story with a beautiful juxtaposition between killing as a crime and killing as a method of punishment by the state.  The ending scene is powerful.  It makes one rethink the position that they hold on the death penalty.  Whether your opinion is changed or not; you will be moved to think.
0345446798|5.0|This book was an absolute pleasure to read.  Very well written and filled with a lot of great advice and stories.  I have read about 6 dog behavior type books so far and this has to be my favorite...hands down.  I am buying copies for my dog owning friends for christmas!!
6305827079|1.0|What a disappointment.  The original was truley entertaining, showing Elvis rip his pants, classic dance moves, and interviews with fans.  WHY change a good thing?  They should rename the video Elvis - thats part of the way it is...
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam, at one time synonymous with hard rocking teen angst. Lets face it, almost every time someone mentions P.J. the first things that come to mind are Jeremy's suicide, the haunting notes and lyrics of \\"Garden\\" and love gone wrong àla \\"Black.\\" It's unfair and unfortunate that, while the band grows from album to album, the majority of the listeners do not. Disappointment sets in every time a record is released...(Insert \\"I can't wait till they make another `Ten' again.\\" Remarks here.)... Granted, even though the once hard rockers from the City of Grunge have gradually slowed the tempo, other facets of their music shine through.<br />Their latest release, \\"Riot Act\\", is the accumulation of a decade of maturity. It is also proof that the cliché is true...Things DO get better with age. \\"Riot Act\\" runs the entire gamut that most fans expect. From the McCready, guitar driven track, \\"Save You\\", to the Vedder quasi-spoken word \\"Bu$hleaguer.\\" Even latest and greatest drummer Matt Cameron penned a couple tracks, \\"You Are\\", and \\"Wanted to Get Right.\\" The addition of a piano {\\"Can't Keep\\"} and organ {\\"Love Boat Captain\\"} round out a few nice sounding songs.<br />This album, contrary to what has been said, isn't just for hardcore Jam fans. If you have liked any of their previous works, then you will enjoy this record greatly. Many of the tracks on \\"Riot Act\\" sound like they could have been on any of the other albums. There are also many that are like you've never before. {\\"Arc\\" comes to mind here.} <br />Bottom line, this is a great record. Pearl Jam again has turned out a masterpiece. For those of you that don't own it already.....run, don't walk....break speed limits........steal a car if you must to get out and buy this album...
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah has never sounded as good as she did back on this record.<BR>She had insight enough to cement her partnership with Walter Afanasieff (HERO and MUSIC BOX) and Cliviles/Cole (NOW THAT I KNOW and I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU), but she also brought on board Babyface (NEVER FORGET YOU) and Dave Jam Hall (DREAMLOVER - her first foray into melodic hip hop).<BR>This way the collection reached a cohesion that failed to be there in her previous album EMOTIONS.<BR>She also started covering BIG hits: WITHOUT YOU was one of her best career steps.<BR>The voice is soothing, dreamy, strong, soaring according to the track.<BR>This is the Mariah I will always like and buy!<BR>)
B0000787FH|5.0|Double-dipping is okay, I suppose. Normally I'd be vehemently opposed to \\"triple-dipping\\" (re-re-releasing an artist's work), but since most of my Elvis Costello CDs were stolen last year, Rhino's reissuing of the entire EC catalog is a welcome idea to me, and one that is accomplishing the seemingly impossible task of improving on Rykodisc's similar reissue project.<br />Rhino is apparently reissuing Elvis' entire recorded output (unlike Rykodisc, he's not just reissuing the Columbia years), and releasing them three at a time roughly twice a year (in no discernible order, it seems). The best thing about Rhino's project is that every release is a two-disc package, with all the bonus material on disc two. This makes for quite a lot of bonus material.<br />\\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was a higly welcome reissue. I first bought the vinyl copyof this masterpiece in 1986, then I bought the Columbia CD in 1993 and the Rykodisc version in 2000. It seems like the fourth time's the charm.<br />For those of you not familiar with this album, it was released in 1982 to wide critical acclaim. The lush production and strong songwriting make it, in my opinion, one of Elvis' best and most certainly his most intelligent. The album's been a part of my life for 16 years and I know the thing backwards and forwards. The moody \\"Beyond Belief.\\" The epic, beautiful \\"Man out of Time.\\" The latin-tinged, accordian-fueled \\"Long Honeymoon.\\" Steve Neive's psychotic orchestrations on \\"...and in Every Home.\\" And that's just part of side one.<br />The Rhino disc two is a veritable treasure trove for anyone interested in this album. There's tons of alternate, early  versions of oterwise great songs, giving them an intersting new edge. \\"Kid About It\\" is pared down a bit. \\"Little Savage\\" is given an R&B-ballad shot in the arm.  \\"Beyond Belief\\" was originally named \\"The Land of Give and Take\\" with slightly different lyrics. \\"Town Cryer\\" is given a fast-paced disco treatment, making it sound like an Abba song (that description may sound like sacrilege to an EC fan, but believe me, it sounds great).<br />There's lots of stuff that was also featured on the original Ryko bonus track section, like the cover of Smokey Robinson's \\"Head to Toe,\\" the gleeful, upbeat \\"I Turn Around,\\" and the unused waltz-like title track (a lot of this stuff is also familiar to long-time fans in the form of various B-sides and compilation albums, like the excellent \\"Out of Our Idiot\\" collection).<br />Die-hard EC fans from back in the day will be in heaven, rediscovering this classic in a new light. New EC fans will also be very happy with this purchase. I can't imagine anyone not liking \\"Imperial Bedroom.\\" Rhino's version makes ignoring this classic even more of a crime.(that description may sound like sacrilege to an EC fan, but believe me, it sounds great).  <br />There's lots of stuff that was also featured on the original Ryko bonus track section, like the cover of Smokey Robinson's \\"Head to Toe,\\" the gleeful, upbeat \\"I Turn Around,\\" and the unused waltz-like title track (a lot of this stuff is also familiar to long-time fans in the form of various B-sides and compilation albums, like the excellent \\"Out of Our Idiot\\" collection). <br />Die-hard EC fans from back in the day will be in heaven, rediscovering this classic in a new light.

6305546789|5.0|This little horror film came out back in 1978 and scared the hell out of almost everyone who saw it back then and it continues to scare people today.It scared me so bad I couldn't sleep for two months.Great directing,acting,great and creepy score and most of all one scary character Michael Myers.
0066214122|5.0|You'll love this one.  This novel is vintage Michael Crichton.  Plenty of suspense, and you learn a little about an emerging technology.  I might be a little biased because I like the subject of nanotechnology, but you don't have to know anything about the subject in order to enjoy the book.<BR>I gave five stars in terms of Crichton books, and books in the same genre.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Here is a film for the kid in all of us, adults and children alike.  This movie creates a fantasy world full of childlike wonder and humor - the characters really come to life thanks to brilliant computer animation and some inspired performances by the likes of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and the late James Coburn.  <br />I watched the film without knowing much about the actual plot beforehand (an approach I would recommend to new viewers).  However, I enjoyed it as much the second time around.  Not only is there humor, but there are some sweet and touching moments that are handled perfectly and never stray into the realm of sugary sentimentality.  <br />The attention to visual detail is amazing and will reward repeated viewings.  This is perfect for families to watch together without anyone being bored: a delicate feat that the filmmakers carry off admirably.<br />In short, this is a movie that makes you feel good.  Simple as that.  What more can you ask for during these trying times?
B00006LI4S|5.0|I completely enjoyed David Gilmour's latest release DVD and I enjoyed seeing the reclusive, aging legend perform again. Fellow musicians know that Gilmour's talent is legendary and this DVD reaffirms that although his vocal range may not be quite as strong as it once was (he is in his 50's afterall!), he is still very capable on guitar. The intimate, unplugged setting is a refreshing contrast to the ambitious Pink Floyd productions that we all enjoyed over the years. This DVD allows unfettered access into Gilmour's sense of timing, melody, tone, range and restraint while exploring different songs and music. This is a &quot;must see&quot; for all serious music aficionados and especially for Pink Floyd fans who enjoy pure talent and variety.
0395754100|2.0|What can be added to classic stories like these? The content of this collection is unimpeachable, so I'll pass and skip onto what downgraded the collection.<br />In short, this is a very shoddily constructed book. My wife and I carefully handled it when reading to our son, but within a couple days the page bundles were separating from the binding in two spots. This has progressed at such a rate that the whole book is threatening to come apart.<br />This is inexcusable, particularly given the thickness of the book. If you make a collection like this that will be heavily used and will certainly be handled less than gingerly by children, you better make it strong. That ours got wonky while being read from by two responsible adults makes it worse. Shame on Houghton Mifflin for producing such a poorly made book!<br />We purchased \\"The Complete Adventures of Curious George\\" in the hopes of saving a few dollars over purchasing all seven of the included stories separately. In light of the poor quality, though, it has proven itself to be a terrible value. Check out other options rather than purchasing a book sure to self-destruct.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Nobody transcends generations of pain and insight quite like Johnny Cash.  No matter if you're into rock, country, jazz, blues or even classical-there's a place in your collection for the Johnny Cash who has been making great music on American Recordings for more than a few years now.<br />  The fourth installment on American is &quot;The Man Comes Around.&quot;  And how.  Yes, Johnny covers more songs previously made popular by other artists.  Yes, his voice is weathered and broken in all the right places.  And this is exactly what makes this CD one to cherish.  If Cash's treatment of such songs as Roberta Flack's &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and Depeche Mode's &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; doesn't move you, try on his take of Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water.&quot;  If that doesn't do it, you're too jaded and shallow to be listening to anything this emotional and you'd be better off warbling along to something Celine Dion just crooned about for the fifty-seventh time on Lite Rock.<br />  Cash is the original Johnny Cool.

B00007E8V4|5.0|i've already written a review of this, but Amazon.com chose not to post it for some reason so I'll write another one. I bought this the day before it came out and it is awesome. It is both very similar and very different than the past 2 albums, the only dissapointment is that like Toxicity - the songs are simpler than on the first song..nothing will ever compare to the 15/8 and guitar solo in Solo, or the incredible drums in \\"CUBErt\\" but \\"streamline\\" comes close...personal favorites: Bubbles, Streamline, I-E-A-E-A-I-O, Mr.Jack, and Roulette.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I read all the Spider Man comics growing up. Does the video live up to my imagination? Yes and no. The story follows the original fairly closely but makes a few &quot;unauthorized&quot; physological changes to Parker. No complaints. The production values are high and the effects tastefully, often brilliantly done. So far so good. Do the characters &quot;click&quot;? Goblin, Babe, Uncle, Aunt are all in character and well crafted. Parker? You be the judge. Entertaining, well paced, slick without being sappy. A good time. Seemed to be a hit with my entire extended family, ages 4 to 84.
0066214122|2.0|OH whoopee doo...Crichton has managed to churn out yet another formulary novel. Crichton has  managed to suck me in again, but I swear this is the last time. This time it's about nanotechnology. But it is rather consistent with all of his novels, whether they be about time travel, space aliens, diamonds in Africa, dinosaurs, or, uh, dinosaurs again. They all start out the same way. First he briefs us `lay people' to the technology (which is usually pretty cool), and then heads down the `ol assembly line: his novels ALWAYS involve (1) a crackerjack team of specialists in (2) a nearly impossible situation where they have to rely on (3) the most esoteric areas of their specialties that they manage to (4) recall and implement with the easiest of effort, who are (5) cut off from the rest of the world in one way or another, and there is always the (6) skittish one of the group that manages to die because he freaks out, with an (7) unwilling, but  genius expert leading the team, battling a (8) sinister member amongst them that is all too obvious, (9) while running around in relatively implausible action sequences (that seem to drag on forever), and (10) manages to make us average humans look more stupid than ever. I managed to figure out the ending of this book from the first couple of chapters not because I am smart, or that I am incredibly insightful, but because the book is so painfully predictable. I often wonder if Crichton has a format in Word that he punches up and just fills in the lines. I usually enjoy Crichton's up-to-date analysis of today's technology, but when you are going to make a novel out of it, at least make it different than your past novels!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|A sequel is never as unique the original, get used to it. But this DVD is engaging, fresh and provides a solid entertainment experience. With all such fare a &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; is mandatory. I liked it! I bought it. Both lead characters are well developed and some favorites from MIB 1 are reprised. The effects are great, seamless and believable. The action is non-stop and the ride filled with an appropriate number of twists and turns. The extras/specials are engaging but not spectacular.
B000000H5K|2.0|This ok for Nu - Metal I guess (not really), but Sepultura was once a GREAT band. I would not spend your money on this album though you should buy their albums before this one insted. Max and the band turned their backs on their real fans with this album :(
B00003CXXP|2.0|Lets get the technical stuff off the table before reviewing the video. Great look, wonderful sets, Fabulous production values, CGI and special effects. The actors are superb, the characters are complex and multi-dimentional, rich and believable. The story line is engaging, surprising and entertaining. So why do people seem to either hate or love this movie. Because underlying the entire movie is the theme that human beings, in general, are an evil disease infecting the universe and should be eraticiated. Every human being featured is a degrading, psychopathic monster with a civilized veneer. The final scenes are horrific in an emotional sense and deeply disturbing as well as intellectually false. Do not let your children watch this movie. No matter how artfully done, I wouldn't want to watch someone torture a being (organic or artificial) to death. This video is the intellectual equivalent of bear baiting.
B000068OSK|4.0|This CD isn't as accomplished as White Blood Cells or De Stijl, but it's a must-listen for fans of the band. Songs like \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good\\" and \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" show the bluesy, ballsy style that pushed these guys out of obscurity; the cover of \\"St. James Infirmary\\" proves that Jack White is a crazed, formidable talent. People who think the Stripes' lack musical talent don't get it...this is bluesy rock stripped down to its bare essentials, and Jack White may be the best thing that happened to rock since Hendrix.
B000021XR5|4.0|It's a long way back from Tiny music...Stone Temple Pilots is back with its heaviest and most diversified album.The firsts tracks on this CD are so Dry and Heavy, it'ld make you sweat naked in Antartica.As the album goes on, the songs gets \\"lighter\\"but certainly not in a bad way...check out MC5, No way Out, Sex and Violence...Punk Heavy Metal with class!It seems like they spent some time listenin' to their old vinyls of the sex pistols, MC5 (of course), Stooges, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and made a fine modern brew of it all.<BR>My favourite of all 5 S.T.P.'s albums.
0375414053|1.0|What a disappointment!  This book is poorly written, erratic and overly cute.  The topic -- balancing the overwhelming demands of a challenging career & young children -- is timely & there are flashes of real feeling & humor, but overall it is flat and a chore to read.  I suggested it for my book group & am truly sorry.
1402502184|5.0|Serious themes, seriously meant and you just can't stop laughing. <br />That is, when you have a teeny weeny bit of insight into how it is for the first and second generation immigrants. If you have no idea what it's like, or take things too seriously then I can't say for sure if you're going to get all of the perspectives right in this one, which undoubtedly leads to missing all of the best jokes. <br />It's like being the fly on the wall as the wonderfully developed characters shuffle through the confusion of who they really are.
0375414053|4.0|This is an exaggerated story about the life of a working mom, but the exaggeration only made it funny.  Allison Pearson's assessment of how professional women who also choose to be mothers are viewed by male coworkers hits the nail on the head!  Pearson's witty writing made this book a joy to read, although I did find the ending rushed.  <br />Hope there will be a sequel!
B00005JL2O|3.0|The third and apparently the last in the AUSTIN POWERS franchise (but when have Hollywood execs ever been able to make their ... minds up?). GOLDMEMBER is a rather patchy installment with the threadbare plot having Austin trying to find his father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) who abandoned him as a child and catching the 70s rollerskating villain Goldmember, also played by Myers. This sequence is shown in a not terribly funny flashback. GOLDMEMBER's opening credits on the other hand are absolutely hilarious, but in this case the movie seems to be centered on gross outs than cleverness. Beyonce Knowles is okay as Austin's blaxploitation sidekick Foxxxy Cleopatra, and of course Myers as Fat Bastard makes sure there is more literal toilet humor to make viewers laugh and blow chunks through their living rooms. There are numerous cameo appearances, including Fred Savage as informant The Mole who has a freakishly big mole on his face. Clever. The movie's ending is a real copout too. But the most amazing thing about this movie is that one of my neighbours is practically a dead ringer for Goldmemeber. And he's from Holland too! Seriously, isn't that vierd?
0064407667|5.0|There are a lot of one- and two-star reviews for this book, calling it dark, depressing, and overall just needlessly sadistic.  I just want you to know that they are all entirely correct; if you're looking for a bland and sickeningly cheerful story where against all possibility everything magically turns out right in the end, you should very well heed the warning on the back of the book, put it in some forgotten dresser, and pick up Harry Potter or its like.  Just take care so as Lord Voldemort doesn't frighten you.<br />However, if you are a more strong-stomached reader, one who enjoys books where bad things happen to good people on the first page, where it's darkest just before it goes pitch-black, and where, just when it looks entirely hopeless, the villain has your baby sister in a birdcage, than you'll enjoy this book immensely.  And remember, these are fictional characters, so there is nothing morally wrong with laughing at their misfortune.<br />Buy this book.  Buy the series.  Buy the Unauthorized Autobiography.  Than get some Terry Pratchett.  That man's a comic genius!
B00006LWSF|3.0|I'll keep this short and to the point.  Lose Yourself, 8 Mile, Spit Shine, and Rabbit Run are awesome songs.  That's the only reason to buy the cd.  Eminem should have been on every song to make this the greatest soundtrack ever.  But since he wasn't, this album isn't worth the money.  Just make sure you get the song 8 mile, its better than Lose Yourself.
B00006LSM3|5.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is classic George Harrison that contains some of his strongest, most incisive work.  There are no weak spots on this posthumous album, with \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" standing proudly among Harrison's finest songs. The additional production by Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison complements George's transcendent musical vision.  Clocking in at 46 minutes, \\"Brainwashed\\" represents a graceful coda to Harrison's career.
B00005RFAI|5.0|If you think that only a female could like Pink, you're wrong.  I think this CD is awesome, with only one or two songs that I don't really care too much for (Respect being one).  I have to say that &quot;Save me from me&quot;, &quot;Just like a pill&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;, &quot;Family portrait&quot;, &quot;Lonely girl&quot;, and Numb&quot; are all excellent in my opinion.  That doesn't mean that the others aren't good too though.  It's very hard to find a CD with so many songs this good.
B0000028MA|4.0|Has it really been TEN years?!  I've always wondered how many people actually *watched* this film and how many others -like myself- just bought the album because we liked the bands?...  <BR>SINGLES came out at just the right time and rode the wave of &quot;Everything-Seattle-rules&quot; -based energy that swept early 90's America.  As I said, I never saw the film but I've enjoyed the album many times.  A few of the tunes are not my thing and that's why this doesn't get five stars.  But the rest, from the beauty of Chris Cornell's &quot;Seasons&quot;, rage of Soundgarden's &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; and Alice In Chains &quot;Would?&quot;, the brooding melancholy of &quot;Chloe Dancer...&quot; (worth the price of the disc alone) -all of these are stunning songs with depth and passion.  Mudhoney, Jimi, Pearl Jam, and Screaming Trees also turn in great performances here.  The whole album really captures the energy and attitude of the period.<br />Recommended.
B000067CPX|4.0|That's what I thought the lyrics were when I heard it on the radio!  I loved the song anyway and got the album, and then had the revelation that &quot;fly away on my zephyr&quot; does make much more sense!  This ranks up there with &quot;I was Barney Rubble&quot; in the Tom Petty song &quot;I was born a rebel&quot; and &quot;excuse me while I kiss this guy&quot; in &quot;kiss the sky&quot; from Hendrix.<BR>Anyway, great song and great album from the peppers.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I didn't really steal it, but this has got to be the most clever title for a cd i've ever seen.  And it is well worth your money.  Well, I was psyched they were releasing songs that didn't make it on toxicity, and my expectations were met and then some.  These songs are not rejects, they just weren't put on toxicity because they didn't fit in with the overall flow.  That's why all the songs don't fit together on this, either.  Well, every song is really good, and just pure SOAD.  I could just tell I was going to like it as soon as I heard Chic n' Stu.  It's really about stuff that relates to chicken stu (I'm sure it's a metaphor for something, but I can't figure it out).  Every song after that is good.  Innervision is really good.  It starts out average, but then the chorus's riff is really fast.  Each song is just a 2 and a half minute burst, which leaves you wanting more (except 36 which I think is called that because it is around 36 seconds).  None of the songs get boring (even Roulette which is sort of slow for SOAD).  Streamline I had already heard before, but it is still good.  A lot of these songs are worthy of being singles, even though I doubt they will make any of them singles because these are just old songs.  If you are just getting into SOAD get Toxicity first, and then you will appreciate these songs more.  But whatever you do, buy this album eventually (there are also four cover-one for each band member).  I already can't wait for their next album!  YEAH SYSTEM OF A DOWN KICKS...!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Great CD. Highly recommended. However, if this is supposed to be a collection of all Elvis #1 songs there is one song missing.  In 1956, &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You&quot; hit #1 in the USA. Unfortunately, it is missing from this CD.
B000075BFK|4.0|I must say, I've been sweating 2PAC ever since he appeared on Digital Underground's \\"This is an EP Release\\" for the song \\"Same Song\\".  It was something about the way he kicked his verse on that song that was just like WHOA!  And it's been on ever since.  I have everything he's done (dead or alive) including bootleg.  I was not disappointed in Better Dayz but I think Afeni Shakur needs the best producers to put out an album for an icon such as PAC.  I would have like Dr. Dre to have had more of an influence on his material.  I know they had a falling out towards the end of the Death Row debacle but money is money, and I'm sure Dre would have been down for the cause.  Anyway the album is good and \\"MY BLOCK\\" has always been one of my favorites.  I like the original version better (Russell Simmons, TThe Show SDTRK). And \\"Who Do You Believe In\\" are the two deepest and most reflective songs on the LP.  Unfortunately, since these songs are before his death, we may never know exactly what a mature 30 something year old PAC would sound like today.  That's the tragedy of it.  He would have only gotten better and better.  For collectors like me, it's a joy.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This work by John is perfect. I have had the chance to meet John before his stardome and fame. He is one hell of a guy and a extremely talented artist. I cannot wait for what is to come from this guy!
B000075BFK|4.0|Why do people care if this record sounds contrived?  Sure, there's no way that Nas would be on this record if Pac was alive, but that doesn't change the fact that the song is good.  Maybe this CD would be a lot different if Pac had more of a hand in it, but it is still a 2Pac record and definitely worth owning, no matter what the &quot;2Pac purist&quot; reviewers say.  If you have ever liked a 2Pac album, get this one, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I can see why this movie made it so big when it hit the box office in 1990. It is a good family movie that is entertaining for parents and children. Most of the characters were interesting, especially the Beast, Gaston,and LaFlour(SP?). The plot is handled well and flows well. Most of the songs are memerable as well. <br />I can see why this brought Disney back of their slump of the 1980's. It brought back the traditional Disney story book Romance that we found in Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. The animation, story, and character finally all came together.<br />The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that I noticed that the Beast and Belle seem to be off model in a few scenes, if only for a little while. It is most obviouse in the little dinner scene when the Beast tries to eat with a spoon. It just looks like the posture and the body and facial proportions are awkward to me for some reason. I know this is picky, and some may not even notice, care, or even think that its drawn funny. I just thought some scenes could have been looked at with a more carefull Disney eye.<BR>On the DVD commentary they say that they didn't have much time to make the movie so I guess that is a good enough excuse. <br />Other than the above picky comments the DVD is great. At least on my TV set the color and picture is good. The sound seems to be good too. It has an entertaining and informative commentary and 3 versions of the film. The Original Version is probably the one I like the most since the story flows better with out the \\"Special Edition\\" scene thrown in. A cool little thing that Disney wouldn't normally do is throw in the complete \\"work in progress\\" version which shows the interesting rough pencil tests of the unfinished movie. The second disc has some nice art galleries and pretty interesting making-of features. Of course Disney had to throw in some useless games for the kiddies; which I haven't even looked into yet. All in all its a real good DVD, although not as goodas the Snow White DVD.
B00006J3WH|5.0|From what was probably the most ambitious and entertaining hour of television last season (for any show), comes the soundtrack, which is packed with all of the songs featured in the episode &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot;. In my opinion, that episode is the greatest episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer yet, and part of that is because of the music. Breaking away from the tradition of lip-synching, each cast member took to the microphone and sang their little hearts out. And while they aren't the greatest singers in the world, they proved that they are much more than just actors on a TV show. They sing! They dance! They slay demons! Now, I have never liked musicals (the only one I've been able to watch all of the way through without forwarding through the songs was the South Park movie!), but the songs featured in this episode were all great. And the fact that they were written by the creator himself, Joss Whedon, tells me that this man is a genius. Some of the musical numbers were just O.K., but a couple others were more powerful, like the group number &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, and of course, &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, when Buffy finally reveals to her friends that, contrary to what they had believed, when she was dead she was in a much better place and was actually happy.<br />I am so glad that they decided to release the episode's music on CD. The episode certainly did not get the recognition it deserved (where's that Emmy, already?), but at least it got some special treatment. If you liked the episode at all, I recommend that you get the soundtrack. It's just more proof that this show is probably one of the best shows on television today. I just can't wait until I can own the actual episode as well.
B000065V3M|5.0|Ed Wood is available on DVD from Amazon.co.uk or Play(Region 2) For my money this is Tim B's best film.  Bill Murray steals every scene he appears in.  But then every actor delivers a really lively performance plus Juliet Landau looks incredible, what better reason to get your DVD machine 'chipped'?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This collection of 27 number 1 hits on 1 cd is a absolute winner!If you love music with a passion,or are just a casual rock fan, you are guaranteed to adore this! My favorites? All 27 of them,with \\"Hey Jude\\" being the topper... the Beatles truly were in a class by themselves,this proves it!
B00005YU1O|5.0|&quot;waking life&quot; is much like &quot;the matrix&quot; in that i cannot really tell you what &quot;waking life&quot; is, you have to see it for yourself. it think this masterpiece is truly a different experience for every person.  fascinatingly, the film pursues this very subject: the uniqueness of each individual consciousness. just as one begins to make sense, his dialogue is reduced to insane babblings. the answers seem ever near but always just out of reach.  this film explores thoughts, ideas, and probes perceptions.  some may call it pretentious. i call it visionary. the next evolutionary stage of film making.
B00006LJ72|2.0|Cheaper than the imported \\"Box Of Dreams\\", but about three disks<BR>too long for anyone but devoted fans. Pick up the single disk \\"Paint The Sky With Stars\\", it hits all the highlights. \\"Watermark\\", her first proper album, discounting the BBC Celts soundtrack, was a refreshing debut. What has followed since has been more of the same...one or two nice tunes surrounded by ethereal filler. Enya is best when taken in small doses as was the case with her contribution to the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" soundtrack.
0312954468|5.0|I first read Wilbur Smith's &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and thought it was a heck of a good read.  River God, also by Wilbur Smith will sweep you off your feet!  I loved this story, it will stay with me for a long time (probably forever).  You'll laugh, cry and thrill to the chase! For anyone interested in ancient Egypt (or antiquity in general), this book is a must.  Some readers were put off by the seemingly endless accomplishments by the humble eunuch slave Taita. Let's face it, he had to live by his wits if he was to survive.  Today, Taita would be considered a polymath or genius by our standards.  Being a eunuch, he is divorced from the drives and desires that keep most men slave to their passions.  When reading the ancient historians (i.e., Tacitus, Lucan, Caesar etc.), most aggrandized themselves and their personal roles in history.  Just looking at the entire civilization of ancient Egypt you can see how that culture made important contributions to civilization that is with us to this day.  The Greeks, Romans and all the great religions owe a big debt to the ancient Eqyptians.  A lot of research went in to this story and the probability of the events in the book are very high indeed.  In River God, The depecition of politics, greed, lust and the human condition are timeless.  To me, the success of a book of this caliber is that it makes you want to read more about the subject matter.  Remember this is a work of fiction (the dynastic reign is fictionalized) so sit back, relax and let your imagination soar. When I grow up, I want to be like Taita... Thank you Mr. Smith!<br />p.s., check out Stephen Saylor's books (the Roman Blood series) featuring Gordianus the Finder.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Surprisingly consistant and enjoyable swansong from the quiet Beatle. Easily his most fully realized album since &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Son Dahni and Jeff Lynne didn't overwhelm the material with post-production bells and whistles. The songs on the album show a remarkable acceptance of fate that only a true believer could understand fully.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The album by the new band Audioslave composed of the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine plus Chris Cornell is an excellent CD.  It has those heavy riffs and sci-fi guitar sounds that made Rage famous in the early 90's, combined with the powerful voice of Chris Cornell.  These two sounds blend very well and emit wonderful music.  There are the heavy rock tunes of \\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How to Live\\", and \\"Light My Way\\" and for the softy at heart there are \\"The Last Remaining Light\\", and \\"Getaway Car\\".  This CD really has it all.  A new sound (that should not be compared to Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden)heavy rock riffs, and soft hearted rock anthems, not to mention access to awesome online content where you can hear interviews and unreleased tracks.  The only reason for this album not to get 5 stars is, on some of the songs Tom Morello's guitar solos can be a bit lengthy and really going no where in respect to the song.  I highly recommend anyone looking for something to take the spot light away from today's pop garbage to check this out!!!
B00000253N|5.0|I don't know if this is Dylan's &quot;best&quot; album, but it certainly is my favorite.  A wonderful distillation of country, folk and that certain unique something that Dylan had going on in the early '70s.  Ace bunny killer.
0151008116|2.0|I was quite excited to read this, but despite a great introduction, I found the book mediocre and, frankly, pretty gross. Don't read this if you have a sensitive stomach--the descriptions of zebra's being eaten alive from the inside out and the deliciousness of turtle blood is a bit much to take. It just never had the payoff I expected. A very disappointing book.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Everyone's favourite webslinger gets the big-screen treatment at last, but disappoints not only comic book afficiondos but fans of director Sam Raimi as well, and in a rare feat for Hollywood, SPIDER-MAN'S shortcomings lie not so much with the script as they do with the film's expensive but decidedly un-special special effects.  Indeed, the only less-convincing CGI performance of the past year belongs to Sarah Michelle Gellar in SCOOBY-DOO. X-MEN is a far better film and cost a lot less to make.  Despite fine performances from Willem DaFoe and Tobey Maguire, this SPIDER-MAN has surprisingly limp wrists.
B0000784XP|4.0|The Lighthouse Family are a UK based twosome, whose hit includes &quot;Lifted&quot;. They have since remixed this track, tinkered with its workings, and cleverly transformed it into songs that sound nothing like the original at all. Oh no.<br />This 'best of...' collection is a CD single which nobody should be without. If you're big on variety, artistic integrity and good songs then it might not be for you, but as an object lesson in making the most of what you have, it can't be recommended enough.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A compelling story, rendered perfectly.  Real psychology*, drama, suspense, love, mathematics, and university life, all portrayed accurately and not dumbed down to satisfy Hollywood's usual low expectations of viewer lack-of-intelligence (and mis-understanding).  A high water mark, I believe this may be the best picture of all time (so far).<br />(*As a psychology major, I interviewed real schizophrenics in<BR>a state mental hospital.)
B00006RCNW|5.0|I knew, I just KNEW, from the first teaser commercial trailer for this show that they had on display in the months prior to the season premiere, that this show would be a HIT!!  I had heard of Michael Chiklis beforehand, even though I had never watched 'The Commish' before.  I knew that this show was going to blow me away, and that it certainly did... AND MORE!  Everything is on point with this series, the action, the drama, the humor, EVERYTHING!!  Congratulations to Michael for winning the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series.  I am so looking forward to the 2nd Season.  January 7th folks, on F/X, BE THERE.
0634022296|5.0|Thanks to the two previous reviewers, I bought 2 copies of this book for my husband and brother-in-law.  They had bought 3 ring binders and wanted to download music from the internet.

B00001ZWBQ|5.0|The Bee Gees have never had the world acclaim in America and in the music business in general, (especially by those who think they're hiP) but these guys have talent that is just about untouched by any artist out there today....<br />I just got a HDTV and was replaying some of my older DVD's, and I dropped in this one....not only great songs played in full, no medleys, but played live.....<br />My guess is if it were recorded today the audio would be even better, but the boys would not be......you can't get much better than this
B0000027RL|3.0|Well, I have to give credit to Pearl Jam who helped the early 90's grunge movement tremendously, and I do like them. However, this is NOT to be compared with Nirvana's NEVERMIND. Although TEN did, later on, outsell NEVERMIND, Nirvana's greatest is recognised as the album that was the biggest part of the grunge movement. And it was. Because it was the best record to come out of the grunge movement. Songs like &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; molded a generation, and I seriously recomend both NEVERMIND and IN UTERO instead of TEN. Actually, I would recomend MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS above TEN also. But still not a bad CD and a big part of grunge.

B00006LSM3|4.0|What can I say? It's not bad. If you mostly find yourself skipping over George songs when tracking Help, Revolver, etc., you're in for a surprise. Worth the money. The guy left us a gem.
B00006LSM3|5.0|BRAINWASHED is one of George Harrison's greatest solo albums, as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter. BRAINWASHED ranks with ALL THINGS MUST PASS (1970)and CLOUD NINE (1987)as milestone Harrison solo albums.The album was initially to be called PORTRAIT OF A LEG END and was one Harrison was working on for several years. On CLOUD NINE Harrison brought back his black Gretsch Duo-Jet guitar to recapture the Cavern and early Beatles sound. He wanted to show his guitar chops on this album. On BRAINWASHED, Harrison says: \\"Give me plenty of that guitar.\\" Harrison plays electric slide guitar, acoustic guitar,dobro, keyboards, bass, ukulele, and banjolele and finger cymbals on this album. Harrison also provided his own background vocals. The guitar playing is George Harrison at his best. People forget that Harrison was one of the most influential and innovative guitarists of the 20th century. The Rickenbacker 12-string guitar sound in 1964 was copied and ripped off from Harrison. Many groups relied on the Rickenbacker 12 string sound pioneered by Harrison to create their sounds. Harrison never got the credit. He introduced the sitar on a pop/rock record with NORWEGIAN WOOD in 1965. The slide playing was one of the most influential. Indeed, Jimi Hendrix copied and ripped off his style from George Harrison and Jeff Beck. Hendrix copied the Leslie organ speaker sound the Beatles achieved on REVOLVER. Hendrix also ripped off the REVERSE guitar solo from REVOLVER and the REVERSE drum effects. Hendrix covered the George Harrison guitar licks on his version of DAY TRIPPER which he recorded for the BBC Radio One program. Harrison also influenced Eric Clapton and Cream. Harrison played guitar and co-wrote BADGE on the last CREAM album GOODBYE (1969). Stevie Ray Vaughn covered TAXMAN while Ted Nugent covered I WANT TO TELL YOU. Harrison's impact on rock guitar was immense. On BRAINWASHED, Harrison sought to recapture that guitar bravado he established with CRY FOR A SHADOW in 1961.<br />Vocally, it is one of Harrison's best performances. As a songwriter, it is the most solid collection of songs since CLOUD NINE. Every song is remarkable. MARWA BLUES is a instrumental that features slide guitar with aluusions to WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU and STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER. RUN SO FAR is a song that Harrison wrote for Eric Clapton's 1989 JOURNEYMAN album. Many of the songs sound like they came off The Traveling Wilburys albums. This is because Harrison, co-producer Jeff Lynne, and drummer Jim Keltner were all Wilburys. NEVER GET OVER YOU is the most Beatlesesque song on the album, a ballad/love song that recalls the euphoria and winsome joy of first love that was a hallmark of the early Beatles singles. LOOKING FOR MY LIFE and STUCK INSIDE A CLOUD are songs about mortality and the acceptance of it. \\"Some times my life it seems like fiction ...I am a living proof of all life's contradictions\\" he sings on PISCES FISH showing his ambivalence about fame and stardom. He says that \\"I wish I had the answer to give Don't even have a cure.\\" Does fame matter in the end?There is only tranquility and a transcendence. BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP  BLUE SEA is the most care-free and joyful song on the album, played on ukelele with a swing jazz type of accompaniment. The song was written by Harold Arlen with Ted Koehler. Arlen wrote LET'S FALL IN LOVE, THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC, and OVER THE RAINBOW in the WIZARD OF OZ. ROCKING CHAIR IN HAWAII is based on Hank Williams' 1950 song \\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues.\\" The title song BRAINWASHED is a scathing but tongue-in-cheek attack on our manipulative and materialistic culture reminiscent of fellow Wilbury Bob Dylan's RAINY DAY WOMEN #12 & 35. \\"Declare the pennies on your eyes\\". The answer according to Harrison is found in spiritual transcendence.The album is the culmination of Harrison's entire musical career. BRAINWASHED crystallizes George Harrison's musical and lyrical vision.It is the apotheosis of his musical and lyrical achievement. BRAINWASHED is a coda to a remarkable career in music. I highly recommend this album.ement. BRAINWASHED is a coda to a remarkable career in music. I highly recommend this album.

B00001PE4D|5.0|Over the numerous movies Ive seen in my life, I must say this is by far the absolute best. Based on a controversial novel, Cruel Intentions has brought the word 'seduction' to a whole new level. Prepare to engross yourself into the world of the upper east side, where the only form of amusement for Sebastian and Katherine is to screw with other people's lives and see how many people they can bed. Both provocative and endearing this movie is far different then any you have seen. These people are brutal and refuse to sensor themselves to please others, which I find most attractive about this movie. Above all else Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar make a phenomenal pair and truly engross themselves in their roles. This movie is a must have for all movie collections.
B000000OUJ|4.0|\\"A lot of time was spent with just me sitting there alone,   just writing. Sometimes RZA would leave, and go out to the city and have meetings and come back, and I'd still be on the same verse, after 5 hours. You know, resting, wake-up, same thing every night\\"- GZA on Liquid Swords album which was recorded in RZA's Staten Island basement.<BR>  I am writing a 2002 review of a 1995 album because it is about time that we give new life to classic cds in order to escape the stagnating world of contemporary hip hop. If you are serious about your hip hop then reading this review will just make you feel better about the decision you made to buy it. Otherwise, if you are into hardcore rap and you don't own this cd, leave your desk and buy it right now.   <BR>    If you are looking for an album that you can listen to from beginning to end, one that will make you feel that your money was well spent, then Liquid Swords is your album. I have been a Wu loyalist since '93, and this album is incredible. The GZA's lyrics and flow over RZA beats is addictive. It simply works, the cd carries forward this raw Wu-Tang energy that is completely absent in the world of Corporate [] Rap.<BR>     The songs Liquid Swords and 4th Chamber by themselves are worth buying this entire album. Experimental beats with the great Wu martial arts themed beats permeate this album. There are no albums like this one. It stands in a class by itself.  Make sure you buy GZA's newest album Legend of the Liquid Swords on December 10th.
0316666343|5.0|I was completely blown away by this book.  Sebold tells the story from the point of view of a dead girl, beginning with her murder, and ending 10 years later, as the protagonist views her family from heaven.  The story is told in an extremely poignant fashion without becoming a tear-jerker or an overly emotional \\"statement on the human existence.\\"<br />The story itself, the plot, the characters, and the narrative style are portrayed very intelligently, though there is nothing pretentious about it.  <br />The scenic descriptions are sublime, and there is suspense involved, though this isn't in any way a mystery.  The characters are slowly, but fully, developed, and the passage of time is shown with a light hand.<br />I will read every book Sebold writes.
0575056975|5.0|This is a great part of the Discworld series and actually the first one that really got onto me. The story is pretty good, about Death needing a break (DEATH, I mean) and his search for a replacement, which is, you'd guessed, Mort. The book is really funny, and the characters are funny and a bit more realistic than most characters from the first two Discworld books (yeah, I know this is number FOUR but I didn't like number three, Equal Rites, very much). Overall one of the better ones in the series.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Rage and Soundgarden were two powerful, important bands of the 90's, helping define a sound that carried rock in their time.  Audioslave, although a few tracks may seem like a simple blend of the two sounds, is a new band that explores new areas for all the musicians involved.  It is an interesting listen, both kicing and melodic.  Check it out.
B000059TEQ|1.0|The film is stilted, overacted, theatrical.  The dialog delivery?  It was like Oliver and Jennifer were reading from a script.  When one hardly finishes saying something, the other is ready with a retort!  &quot;Brrrrrrk&quot; it comes out!  &quot;Love Story&quot; is not as boring a movie as it is... uh...  phoney.  You want to watch a real love story to get those tear ducts working watch &quot;Waking The Dead&quot; with Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly.  Now that's what I call a good script, good acting, realistic and and heartbreaker of a movie.
0767819462|5.0|Julia Roberts is becoming the stepmother of two kids who are absolutely partial about it and do not want to give her the smallest space in their life, preferring their own real mother. Divorce is not an easy matter and remarrying is even more difficult for the children. But a stepmom has to learn how to become and be a real mother, has to learn how to capture the children's attention, interest and trust. This is done especially because the real mother has cancer and is going to die. When she realises this she stops fighting and helps the stepmom to be accepted by the kids because she has to give way to her since she is going to go and leave forever. The relation between the two mothers, the real one and the step one, is explored in great details and is very convincing. The kids are also very good and full of feeling and true emotion. The father is mostly on the sideline and certainly not the center of the film, but after all the stepmother is the star, the stepmother who is being born little by little. Emotions and feelings are uppermost in this film that becomes some entertaining and also thought bringing two hours.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan
B00006LLNU|5.0|Well, what can I say? &quot;()&quot; is genius. If you liked Sigur Ros' second album &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;, then you could not possibly be disappointed with &quot;()&quot;. The album is an epic 70 minute piece of music that can be the soundtrack to whatever mood you're in. The sheer depth of emotion it can bring is amazing. Purchase this and put it into your cd player. You will be mesmerized. You will smile. You may find tears in your eyes. You cannot help but be caught up in its beauty. <br />This is an album I'll be still listening to in 20 years.
B00006LFGD|3.0|Barbra Streisand has certainly recorded her fair share of duets in a recording career with Columbia Records that now spans 40 years.  The best of these duets are collected here on the second compilation of her career highlights released this year.    For me, the best of these are the earlier ones, with Judy Garland and Harold Arlen from the 1960's when Streisand was unstoppable, at her unparallelled and fearless best.  The '70's saw her go the commercial route, the road she has chosen almost always ever since.  Thus, the '70's, '80's and '90's found her in less than stellar company, often striving for commercial rather than artistic success.  This is most evident when she is mismatched with such lesser vocal lights as Don Johnson, Vince Gill and Bryan Adams, with Streisand giving each of these partners a vocal trouncing.  Even a belated duet with Frank Sinatra has Barbra overwhelming \\"the chairman of the board\\".    Apart from Garland, none of Streisand's female duet partners is her equal and finds much rapport with her.  Barbra seems most happy duetting with herself on the 1971 recording of the two Bacharach songs.    The two new numbers are nice though uninspiring.  What amazes is the condition of Streisand's pipes after 40 years of recording.  Somehow time has stood still for the past 15 or so years without a trace of deterioration.  What a pity that she didn't gives us a completely new album of material that is worthy of her talent, perhaps mining the treasures of the scores of classic films (an idea she tantalized us with back in 1986 but to date has not been recorded), more Broadway material or perhaps a jazz styled outing rather than yet another repackage of material from the back catalogue.    In all, I am not displeased with this set though I would have preferred a completely new album.  My advice:  this is a fine set for the new fans and those of us who haven't snapped up the recent albums where most of this material was originally to be found.  For the diehards, yes you will have to have this.
B000002UB3|2.0|The fact that Abbey Road stinks,is to me far too obvious to be ignored any longer. Saying this is NOT an attempt to make myself interesting. I agree that The Beatles made more evergreens than any other band. I love most of their material. The magic touch is however almost totally missing on Abbey Road.<br />John Lennon is the one that disappoints me the most on this album. Frankly, he sounds more like a sleepwalking junkie than anything else. How DARE I? Taste this: John Lennon had, at this point of his carreer, little or absolutely no interest whatsoever for the Beatles. This is not a theory. It's a fact.<br />Lennon starts the album with \\"Come together\\". It's his best song for this album, but far from good. It sounds as if John is laying in bed (and he probably was), singing this somewhat lame, unfocused an uninspired song. The lousiest opener for any Beatles album.<br />Harrison's \\"Something\\" is the album's true classic. Possibly one of the ten best Beatles songs ever. <br />Macca's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is obnoxious, and deservedly so. His worst ever song for the Beatles. \\"Oh Darling\\" is a better effort from Paul, great vocal performance, but not much of a song. Just a 50's pastiche like thousands of others. Uninteresting.  <br />Ringo's Octopus Garden? I could say this belongs in a kindergarten, if it wasn't for my deep respect and sympathy for those poor kids. If anyone really likes this: GROW UP!<br />And the worst is yet to come. The absolute hairraising \\"I Want You (she's so heavy)\\" must be Lennon's ekvivalent to \\"Maxwell's\\" as his worst ever Beatles song. Keyword: Catatonic Stupor! This song makes me scream \\"PLEASE LET ME OUT OF THIS!\\"<br />Harrison's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", a lovely song, though not a classic in my opinion,sounds totally out of place in the company of this garbage. With this, and \\"Something\\", George alone saves this album from a total catastrophy. <br />Then comes Lennon's \\"Because\\". Absolute rubbish. A sleepwalker's song, if there everwas one. <br />Paul's \\"You never give me your money, starts out pretty promising, but soon looses direction completely. It's more like a medley of unfinished, half baked ideas than a song, which is OK if it makes sense an adds up. This doesn't. <br />Rest of the elbum is pretty much like that. Medleys of unfinished song and short fragments. Calling this a \\"suite\\" is a complete mistake! Three more songs from Lennon follows on a row. \\"Sun King\\" is the sleepwalker again. It hurts to hear Lennon in this terribly apathic, selfcontained state. The two next songs, \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" are faster, but ecually horrible. They are nothing less than a pouting insult against everything the Beatles represented at their best. <BR>After this Lennon disappers, and McCartney takes over the control for the rest of the album. He has nothing much to offer, at least not a decent song. There are some promising fragments here, but they never develop into songs. \\"Golden Slumbers\\" starts out quite promising, but suddenly there comes \\"Carry That Weight\\", that is no song at all, just a silly, irritating refrain that makes me think of football. McCartney's attempt to make some sense of the mess by repeating the opening theme from \\"You never give me your money\\" is not a bad idea, but neither is it a brilliant one. The \\"jam\\", and the drum solo especially,in \\"The End\\" I find dreadful. The \\"song\\" itself is nothing but the briefest fragment, popping up from nowhere and disappearing just as fast. \\"Her Majesty\\", that ultimately ends this album, is just a short throwaway.<br />Well, this album sure isn't much of an offering, is it? So why the universal acclaim of it? I believe it has a lot to do with people's need for a good story and a happy ending. \\"The greatest band ever comes together and make their final masterpiece\\", that sounds just so beautiful, so right, it can't possibly be any other way, can it? To be honest, I have actually myself sung the praise of this album out of pure\\"magic thinking\\", even if I knew there was something fundamentally wrong here. <br />Almost 35 years after it's release, it must be time to reconcider the quality of this album. Rock as an art form deserves it. <br />Thruth is folks, The Beatles last recorded album is a stinker.
0066214122|3.0|It was ok.  The plot falls short - which is disapointing because I enjoy the fact that his books are typically plot driven.  Like I said it was ok - it almost seems like there were two stories going on - but you only get to hear one story.  I guess that's how life usually is most of the time - so if his intent was to be realisic in that sense then he did a good job.  I didn't mind his science lectures - often times they were as interesting as the story itself.  It's not his best but still it's still a lot of fun.
0316666343|5.0|my first thought was how morbid, to write a book about the abduction and murder of a 14 year old.  however the story is not morbid, it is quite interesting.  i love how alice sebold explores all facets of the effects of the death of this girl, how each individual family member, friend and teachers lives are impacted. also the perception of heaven is very intriguing.  all in all i loved the book and could not put it down until i was done reading it.
0156907399|5.0|When I first began to read To The Lighthouse it seemed dull and monotonous but as I kept reading, I began to see how wrong my first impression was. She writes with a beautifully rhythmic pattern that entralls the reader and made me love the book. The book is centered around her characters' private introspections that I both agreed with and learned from. She pulls you into an entirely different world that you simply do not want to leave. I intend to re-read this book over and over again to better absorb its beauty, passion, and wisdom. Read this book! But keep an open mind for it takes patience to fall into this masterpiece that Woolf created.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The 21st century has seen and heard rock music go up and down like a roller coaster thus far, and Audioslave's arrival into the music scene couldnt have come at a better time, when rock is nearly breathing hard to gain its foothold as an artform in the music world. Audioslave is definitely the best collaboration band to exist since Temple of the Dog (and no, i'm not totally biased on Seattle or anything-- it's true) in terms of musical talent and accolades, and their debut album without a doubt, rocks to the max. The single &quot;Cochise&quot; kicks the album off to remind the listeners that the Rage sound is not totally dead even with Chris Cornell as its vocalist,and the rest of the album's 14 tracks would follow nicely in its musical progression. I personally favor &quot;Cochise&quot;,'Exploder&quot;,&quot;Light My Way&quot;,&quot; Set it off&quot; and &quot;What you are&quot; as the tracks to listen to, but even then, all 14 tracks are great. The sound of the album is neither Rage or Soundgarden. It's a little bit of both, with some Led Zeppelin and maybe even weird, techno stuff in it too on a couple of tracks. I think  Chris Cornell's wise in his decision to not continue to sing political lyrics for the band and also for not playing guitar on the song (although he is a pretty good guitarist), and that the ex-Rage guys are wise to listen and adapt to Cornell's voice and style, all without alienating their sound  a bit.  Overall, this CD is a great debut for Audioslave, and well worth the money to purchase it. With great songwriting (although i can live without the overuse of the &quot;black hole sun&quot; &amp; &quot;skin&quot; analogies) and killer instrumental work, this CD is a definite must for any serious rock fan to have in their collection.
B00006IUL7|5.0|It's Christopher Nolan's third movie, and it's fantastic, this guy has great talent, I loved his second picture:\\"Memento\\", in spite many people over here, we're sort of \\"too much\\" taken by surprise by its \\"special\\" storyline (forward and backwards)and thought it was sort of \\"tiresome\\".In my opinion it was a real treat and something totally new, excellent!!<br />This film is as good as \\"Memento\\" but has a more \\"traditional\\" storyline, also, it hasn't the suspense and mystery that \\"Memento\\" had. Let's say it's a drama, but not less interesting. There are no clich&eacute;s, or archetypical characters, no all-goodies, no all-baddies,...only people, with flaws, who commit mistakes, who lie, who let themselves go because of rage, fear, anger, etc.<br />Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors of all time- period....the guy who has starred in \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", et al. gives a knowing performance has the tough-as-nails, \\"superstar\\", L.A. cop who travels with his partner, on an assignment to Alaska, in order to help the local police to capture the murderer of a beautiful 17 year old girl.<br />Hilary Swank plays a young local policewoman, sort of infatuated by this \\"legendary\\" professional's experience (Pacino) and technique, which she has already studied at the Police Academy.<br />Last but not least, Robin Williams playing an unsympathetic \\"heavy\\", with a skill no one would have ever thought of. His voice inflection has changed completely from the usual clown we're used to, his way of looking, restraint,.... everything new for us audiences, he really did a very fine job.<br />I'd read the critics' reviews before watching this film, and although they were good, anyway, I didn't expect it would be as good a movie, with such a surprising plot- when the movie begins, you think it will take a very different \\"path\\" from the one that it really takes, unpredictable, such as real life is.<br />In all, a completely satisfying experience, maybe, except for the final scene- which some may consider sort-of-clich&eacute;d - but I did not. I thought it was coherent with the characters' natures and development through the film.the final scene- which some may consider sort-of-clichéd - but I did not.

6301934229|4.0|C. Thomas Howell and Rutger Hauer star in this thriller about a person who makes the age-old mistake of picking up a hitchhiker.  Howell stars as Jim Halsy, a young man who is driving a car cross country for a friend.  Hauer stars as John Ryder, a hitchhiker who is picked up by Halsey. Little does Halsey know that his life will change forever after picking up Ryder.  Halsey immediately senses that there is something different about Ryder.  Sure enough, Ryder pulls a knife on Halsey and threatens to kill him.  After enduring several long minutes pleading for his life, Halsey manages to push Ryder out of the car door.  Believing that his nightmare is over, Halsy settles back in for his drive.  However, the terror is just beginning as a family in a stationwagon passes Halsey.  He is horrified to see that the family has picked Ryder up.  Halsey does his best to warn them, but he's too late.<br />More and more macabre events occur throughout the film, such as Ryder blowing up a gas station and tying a person between two semi trucks.  Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job as Nash, a waitress who befriends Halsey.<br />This is a good psychological thriller.  The plot is good, and I thought Howell and Hauer gave good performances throughout.  Remember what your mother told you; Never pick up a hitchhiker!
B00005JKCH|3.0|I am so glad David Koepp isn't invited back for the sequel, hopefully the Smallvile guys will not have any of their ideas projected on-screen, either. Though regarding this film, I found Tobey Maguire very likeable, very true to the original concept of Peter Parker, who was always a regular kid and never the typical, blue-eyed, 6 foot, muscle-choked Superhero. I think Kirsten Dunst is alright, but I don't really like her. Her MJ character never really likes Peter, and only comes around to him after noticing how nice he looks. Willem Dafoe is very creepy-looking, though the writing for him was too goofy and stupid. There are many, many humorous moments, most do not come from Spider-Man's mouth. There's a ridiculous scene where Aunt May relates to Peter how he mistook MJ for an angel. And another where she goes crazy in a hospital exclaiming, &quot;Those horrible yellow eyes!&quot; So this is a funny, funny movie, best suited to laughing at it in the back row.  Green Goblin is even goofier, thanks to his lines and costume. Another humorous aspect is how the paper says the wrestling arena requires colorful characters, and then he gets there and everyone is dressed completely in black! They really should have included the beautiful WTC teaser trailer on this DVD, which can be found online. I also like the nod to the comic books in the supplemental materials. Stan Lee's cameo should have been more than a mili-second. The backbone of all of this is fashioned into a very typical story, he evens runs to catch the bus exactly like Forrest Gump and the Goblin asks him to 'join' him, exactly like Darth Vader. Spider-Man should have been a much more original story, elements should have been better. I adore the ending with MJ and Peter, but she mentions his whole name repeatedly and so unnaturally. You do feel for the characters well enough, though. The CGI is sometimes wretched, but towards the end  it has a great scene, I just think all the CGI shots should have been like thatall the way through the film, but I guess they were saving money. GG having his parts severed and MJ in the rain is a little steep for a PG-13 flick. Tobey's voice is a little too original for it not to be obvious to MJ who Spider-Man is, which defeats the purpose of a costume. It wasn't great, or very good, just good. I hope to see it vastly improved upon for the sequel.
B000001FI7|5.0|'Nuff said.  Perfect album.
B000066NW0|5.0|Now this could just as well be a greatest hits album. I'd say 11 of the 13 tracks on the album could hit the top on the billboards. Her songs are verry varied, its not just about love, or just about hate. Despite her young age, the album seems verry mature, and could easily be listened to by adults. Her voice doessn't seem anoyingly immature, when compared to Michelle Branch, or Vanessa Carlton, who in my oppinioun could wait a couple of years. She uses her voice in a beautifull way, sort of like an instrument. <BR>Both adults and young people could relate to this music.<BR>All in all, one of the best albums out there, if not the best.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love this album, as I do everything (for the most part) that Barbra does! I think her voice sounds as wonderful as it did 20 years ago and the duet with herself \\"One less\\" Is amazing!! and yes that would be considered a \\"DUET\\"! The only song I really don't care much for is the duet with Johnny Mathis, Otherwise it's a winner!!!<BR>           David A
B000050XEI|5.0|ENYA HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS MUSIC WILL TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY OF THE SPIRIT. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SOAR AWAY FROM DAILY WORRIES AND RELAX COMPLETELY. I HIGHLY RECOMEND LISTENING TO IT WHILE TAKING A HOT BUBBLE BATH AND LET THE CARES LITERALY FLOAT AWAY!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat was surprisingly better than I anticipated. From the cover and previews at the time, I thought it was yet another fantasy-laden bore. Although not an action film, the story was more inviting than first impressions would present. The acting is good, especially by Juliette Binoche (when will she make more American movies?) and Johnny Depp (who appears much less often than I thought he would). The supporting roles are well-acted also. Although the movie is somewhat predictable, it is still enjoyable for its showing how human behavior can change for the better and that it often takes less effort than eating chocolate. Time to eat!
B000000OXH|5.0|This is the best album ever recorded by the best band ever...Don't really have much else to say. The songs are all perfect. I wore out 2 tapes of this album when I was younger before CD's were invented. I really can't describe the music except that it is powerful..beautiful...sad...liquid sounding at times. I have every album Asia has ever put out and this one is my favorite. They are all awesome but there is just something about this one.
B000070WJE|4.0|Both Robbie Williams and Eminem are extreme examples of pop culture icons influenced by and influencing their environment.<br />In America, Eminem grew up in a hip-hop culture, as did nearly every American under 30 these days. He created a unique style that is both clever and cruel, but keeps the most savage barbs aimed at himself. His music is as often as not autobiographical.<br />Robbie grew up in the teen-pop culture of the UK. He was at one point a member of a very successful boy band called Take That. But otherwise the parallels hold. Going solo, he found his \\"Dr Dre\\" in Guy Chambers, and formed the most successful songwriting duo in England since Elton John & Bernie Taupin.<br />His pop, within the less obviously vulgar culture of UK top 40, is still edgy and this album will probably draw a parental advisory label.<br />This album is certainly his most personal, with songs inspired by his relationship with a member of All Saints, the rumored affair with Ginger Spice, and the death of his grandmother (in the way too sweet \\"Nan's Song\\").<br />But the saving grace of this album are the uptempo songs, such as Handsome Man, with it's ego-stroking verses (\\"I put the Brit in Celebrity\\", \\"Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig?\\") countered by the self-effacing chorus (\\"If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you. If you don't need me I don't exist\\"), and the bizzare \\"Me & My Monkey\\" - not the Beatles track but stylistic tribute to \\"Hotel California\\" in theme & story. By the way \\"Revolution\\", the dullest track on the album is not a Beatles cover either, nor is \\"Song 3\\" a take-off on Blur's \\"Song 2\\".<br />Hot Fudge would sound perfectly at home on Elton John's \\"Honky Chateau\\" album and to my ears the likeliest American hit. And a hidden track (perhaps called \\"Leaving Season\\") is truly hilarious.<br />You've probably heard that Robbie right now has the most expensive record contract in the world. Will this break Robbie in America? His record company will do it's damndest to get their money back, so expect it to.<br />But if you're just being introduced to Robbie Williams, you should go back to his first American release, The Ego Has Landed.<br />Eminem would have killed for a title like that.damndest to get their money back, so expect it to.<br />But if you're just being introduced to Robbie Williams, you should go back to his first American release, The Ego Has Landed.<br />Eminem would have killed for a title like that.
0385508417|1.0|Absolutely horrible. Every single character is barely fleshed out, the writing is no more than adequate, and the plot could come straight from a Lifetime movie. However, what really kills this book is the preposterous ending. After an incredible amount of animosity builds up between Krank and his neighbors, all is forgiven and forgotten in the last few pages. People are trying to get him arrested, and, a few pages later, they are helping him, or receiving gifts from him. Are you kidding? I would never forgive neighbors who treated me that way. Yeah, yeah, it is just a book. But, to defy reality this severely is a crime. I think this book took longer to read then to write.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I thought Moulin Rouge was aswosome because it was a love story and how Christian became invole with the Moulin Rouge. I like the storyline and how it was like back flash. I didn't like when the Duke wanted Satine for him self. I like the costumes in the movie because they just so awesome. The music I thought went really well with it because it was part of the movie. I hope that other people will see it and I hope this help to give you idea of what the movie is about.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's long-awaited 2nd English album was well worth the wait as it accomplishes all that an album should...for listeners and more importantly, for herself.  Not only does this album showcase a more diverse vocal talent than ever before (creating even more distance between her abilities as a singer and others in the pop genre), but also reveals a little more of who she has grown into....a gifted singer, an insightful songwriter, a great fighter, and a beautiful young woman no matter what anyone says!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This question is at the heart of Princess Mononoke. Most of the other characters at one time or another think he is against them. At first viewing it's hard to tell what the main character is up to. He saves the Princess, then he saves Lady Eboshi. Then he's going to help the \\"bad guys\\"? What?!?! Who is evil and who is good? It's not instantly obvious, which makes Princess Mononoke stand up to repeated viewings - many repeated viewings. The story is complex, but not too complex. It's main themes are humanity versus nature (i.e., itself) and hate. Hate destroys and eats away flesh. The tentacle-like demons fashioned from hate provide some of the most incredible animation, and some of the most poignant scenes. Another theme is the idea that sometimes the best side to be on is neither side.<br />The animation is about as good as it comes. Miyazaki is one of the best, and this is one of his best pictures. If the story happens to bore you (it shouldn't), just look at the incredible animation that never lets up. The animated grass growing towards the end is particularly incredible.<br />Animation does not get much better than this. Visually and thematically, there are not many as good as Princess Mononoke out there. Given its themes, it's somewhat surprising that Disney brought this masterpiece to the States. Sure, some of the English dubbed voices are a little off, but this doesn't detract from the film much. It's interesting to watch the film in its original Japanese with English subtitles. The characters come across a little differently this way, and the translations are different in the subtitles. For instance, the \\"Forest Spirit\\" becomes the \\"Deer God\\" in the subtitled version. The voices also are incredibly different, and those who don't appreciate Billy Bob Thorton's drawl will enjoy the Japanese version.<br />There aren't many movies worth owning and watching over and over again, but Princess Mononoke is definitely one of them.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Billy Wilder is one of my all-time favorite filmmakers and SUNSET BOULEVARD is one of my all-time favorite films. As soon as I discovered it would be on DVD, I jumped at the opportunity and am so glad I did.<br />The image quality on this DVD is first-rate. The DVD case indicates that the film is presented in \\"full screen\\" format, which is somewhat misleading. It gives the false impression that the film has been \\"formatted\\" to fit a standard television. While the image does fit the screen without black bars on the top and bottom, the original aspect ratio of the film has been preserved. That is because it is not a \\"wide screen\\" film. Like most films of the period it was shot in standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3), which is the same aspect ratio as a standard television set, so cinema purists need not be alarmed. In other words, there is no annoying \\"pan and scan\\" of the image or parts of the frame cropped off to fill the television screen.<br />For those unfamiliar with the film, it is a scathing portrait of Hollywood and how it discards people when it is decided that they are no longer \\"useful.\\" The casting of the film is inspired. It was if the parts were written for them. Gloria Swanson was indeed a faded silent film star, who had all but disappeared from the movies (although she was still active in the entertainment business). William Holden, while not a down-and-out screenwriter as depicted in the film, was a once promising young actor whose career was stagnating. Erich von Stroheim did in fact work in Hollywood as a director. Put this in the \\"art imitates life category\\": an excerpt of QUEEN KELLY, von Stroheim's ill-fated film starring Gloria Swanson appears in one scene. The cast also includes filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille as himself (who also worked with Swanson during the silent era) as well as several stars from the silent film era (e.g., Buster Keaton) in small roles.<br />From it's bold introduction to its classic ending, SUNSET BOULEVARD is a well-crafted masterpiece. One will be hard pressed to find a dramatic misstep in this film. The structure is classic and the execution is flawless.<br />As part of the DVD's release, several extras are included. Some are standard like the inclusion of the film's theatrical trailer, English subtitles and a French language track (the guy doing Max actually sounds like von Stroheim -- perhaps it was). Other features add up to make this a must buy for fans of the film. One is a map of actual locations used in the film. For example, the exterior of Norma Desmond's home was not actually located on the 10000 block of Sunset Boulevard as depicted in the film. Actually, it was located on Wilshire Boulevard near the corner of Irving Blvd. (one block east of Crenshaw Blvd.). For people who don't know anything about Los Angeles this is about six miles away.<br />Ed Sikov's scene-by-scene commentary on the film is very good if not excellent. In it he provides many insights into the making of the film for those unfamiliar with that aspect. His presentation is generally well-organized and carefully thought out, if a bit dry.<br />One added feature that I really appreciated are two script versions of the original opening sequence of the film. When the film was first previewed for an audience, they reacted unexpectedly, prompting the filmmakers to change the beginning. Also included are silent images of the deleted footage from that sequence. The images are silent because some of the original sound was lost. For those curious about the deleted scenes, they should get a real kick out of reading the script. In Ed Sikov's audio commentary, he reads the dialog over the scene that replaced it. <br />The documentary on the making of the film while not as in-depth is perhaps more interesting. For one reason it includes an interview with Nancy Olson, who presumably is the only principal involved with the film that is still alive. Billy Wilder who of course, wrote and directed the film, died last March at the age of 95. One could only imagine what he would have said about the film over fifty years after its initial release. Needless to say, there are no archival interviews with any of the principals involved with the making of the film. Perhaps this was due to licensing issues, but would have certainly enhanced this DVD release. The closest the DVD comes to utilizing archive footage as it relates to the film, is the inclusion of a fine documentary on Edith Head, the costume designer who worked on numerous Billy Wilder films including SUNSET BOULEVARD. However, in the end, while one appreciates the \\"extras\\" in the film, it is ultimately the film itself that should be the primary motivation for buying this or any DVD.<br />Overall, this DVD is a good value for the money. You get an excellent transfer of the film with enough added features to warrant buying on DVD. A fan of the film or not, this DVD is definitely worth serious consideration.
6302719631|3.0|After the tremendous success of Jane Austen films and TV programs made in the 90s, such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" \\"Sense and Sensibilities\\" \\"Emma\\" \\"Persuation\\" and \\"Clueless\\" (as the modernized \\"Emma\\"), you may expect much fun from this adaptation of \\"Northanger Abbey.\\"  But the reviewers, so far, are not so kind, it seems, and they are some good reasons.  Sure, this one is not good.<br />The story follows Catherine Morland, merry and good-natured, but a little naive girl who is overjoyed to have a chance to visit Bath, a famous spa where she is going to enter the society.  Dazzled by dancing, music, and new friends, Catherine is too happy to know that the society is full of unpleasant things which she soon must learn.<br />And Catherine, who devours the popular books of Gothic novels (like Radcliffe's \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\"), is invited to live at \\"Northanger Abbey\\" for a while by the sophisticated Henry Tilney and his kind sister Eleanor.  Catherine is all too happy to accept the offer, dreaming of experiencing an old castle, some intrigues, secret passages and so on, which are basics of the Gothic novels she loves.  And she thinks she finds a deadly secret among the Tilneys, and especially with its eccentric father in mind, she imagines she is to find something horrible among the place.<br />Here you must remember this: Austen wrote the original book as  a spoof of those Gothic novels and their extraordinary situations -- villains, castles, and confined heroines etc. -- so, you have to take the film in that way.  However, the film fails to convey this playful mood, taking itself rather seriously, or, presenting the heroine in a too clumsy way.  At one scene, she sees General Tilney (father of Henry and Eleanor) grinning and laughing like a big bad wolf in her dream.  It is simply misguided and embarrasing, particularly when you hear a strange jazzy soundtrack with that.<br />There are some romantic aspects in the film, and Catherine naturally falls for a gentleman, but the love story is too short, or looks abbreviated.  What intrigued us in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" -- like Darcy's witty remarks -- is all missing, and above all, everything is underdeveloped.  The heroine is not joyfully meddling like Emma (or Alicia Silverstone for that matter); her history is not as touching as that of Anne Elliot, the heroine of \\"Persuation.\\"        <br />Probably there is a reason for that.  The original book of \\"Northanger Abbey\\" was the first to be written by Austen, but the last one to be published after her death.  This complicated history has been the topic of discussion for academic people, but it is not what we should know.  We should know that it is written before those masterpieces which made her name.  \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is just a blueprint, or a prototype  of what is to come later, even though it has many elements to be found in her great works. <br />In short, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is not definitely Austen's  best, and they should have known that.  And they should have made its film something different than the book.  The film is too faithful to the book, to the fault.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I'm giving this edition a 1 star rating because Disney messed up the video quality. By including 3 versions of the film onto a single disc, the result is high video compression. The low quality is noticable on larger tv screens. As a friend of mine said before, this should've been a 3 disc set w/ 1 version on each disc. Wait til it's reissued if you want a high quality dvd.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This is the best Blondie hits compilation by far and the sound is crystal clear; the hits are not arranged chronologically however, which makes it impossible to chart the development of the band. But that doesn't matter - this collection demonstrates the band's versatility - compare their early punk-pop Rip Her To Shreds or X Offender with the hypnotic synthpop-disco of Heart Of Glass or Atomic! My favorites include the wistful I'm Always Touched and the bilingual Denis (a classic slice of sixties pop), as well as Tide Is High with its percolating reggae rhythm, plus Sunday Girl (more lovely 60's pop). In my opinion, their best albums are Parallel Lines and Plastic Letters, and these are well represented with 6 of these gorgeous 19 tracks. I wouldn't call this a \\"Best Of\\" since there are some album tracks that I like more than some of these hit songs. These include Fan Mail and Bermuda Triangle Blues from Plastic Letters and Fade Away And Radiate from Parallel Lines. But this was never intended to be anything else but a greatest hits collection and serves it purpose very well. It just goes to show that classy pop music is timeless, and Blondie always had that special something, whatever the style they chose to do it in.
B000056VJ7|4.0|Meatloaf was best known for his role of Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show when he released Bat Out Of Hell in 1977.  The album exceeded all sales expectations by eventually selling over thirteen million copies and ranking among the twenty biggest selling albums of all time.  The album is a winning combination of theatrics and pop perfection.  Everything about Meatloaf is big, especially his voice and he has the chops to handle these epic tracks.  Writer Jim Steinman's seven compositions are a not veiled ode to teen lust and Meatloaf attacks them with the fervor of an overhyped teenager.  His vocal interplay with Ellen Foley on tracks like the classic high school rocker \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\" have all the ... tension of a teenage date.  Todd Rundgren's production shows why he is on eof the best in the business.  The music soars and the remastering gives it a new clarity.  Bat Out Of Hell despite all its sales success never made the top ten as it peaked at number thirteen and it is far and away the biggest selling album never to reach that plateau.
0345409671|5.0|Well, this one was certainally different.  I loved it.  It was the kind of book that really put you to thinking.  A book that you remember.  One of the greatest of the Vampire Chronicles.  It was the kind of book that you keep around and read again.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|I just got the DVD after waiting years and was totally bummed when I opened it and it was in &quot;Pan &amp; Scan&quot;....<br />If it were not such a great movie we never would have bought it.
B00006JDVV|5.0|I honestly do not understand all the bad reviews that Reign of Fire received when it opened.  Most people expected an Independence Day style brainless special effects vehicle and instead they got a slow paced character driven sci-fi flick.  I guess these are the same people who thought XXX was a masterpiece.  Anyway, I love Reign of Fire for everything it is and isn't.  Matthew McConaughey (who it is great to see in another great movie without Hollywood gloss, see Frailty to see what I mean) brings to life one of his best roles in the dragonslaying Van Zan, while Christian Bale proves once again that he isn't just female eye candy (for another example see American Psycho).  Both actors are fantastic, while X-Files film director Rob Bowman moves the film at a purposely slow pace so that every time we get a glimpse of a dragon it leaves the viewer wanting more and eventually getting it.  The dragons themselves must be seen to be believed, they breathe, move, and stalk like one would imagine a dragon would in real life.  All in all, Reign of Fire is a masterful high grade B-movie that shines without the Hollywood gloss, and is a true treat of a film.
1881273156|5.0|This should have been a book written for everybody, not just for those in relationships. It helped to open my eyes up to some of the problems people have in relating to each other. <BR>For instance, let's say somebody's love language is giving gifts and another person's love language is words of affirmation. The gift-giving person gives a gift to the words-of-affirmation person and is hurt, because the words-of-affirmation person didn't give a gift back, or didn't give words of thanks enough. What the gift-giving person didn't understand is that the other person's love language was not gifts, but words of affirmation. The words-of-affirmation person feels hurt because the gift-giving person didn't say anything about how great his job performance was, what a nice piece of poetry he had published, etc.<BR>It is very striking how miscommunication can result from not knowing what is important to the other person as to what represents love. This is not only important in relationships, but what represents a true friend to another person. Although this book was written with relationships in mind, it can apply to other situations as well.<BR>There are five main love languages that the author discusses, and these can applied anywhere. It would certainly help to have couples read this book before they marry, or even close friends. It would probably make for better holidays, also.
B00007E8V4|5.0|i have loved system for a while and was very excited about their new album, it's very good but i already had the two best songs<BR>(in my opinion) which are innervision and F**K The System so buy it if you dont have those songs from the internet already.
0385508417|4.0|Luther and Nora are experiencing empty nest syndrome and at the holidays, it is even worse.  Their only daughter Blair has went to work for the Peace Corps in Peru.  Since Luther is an accountant he decides to tally up how much money is spent on Christmas each year.  He discovers that last year they spent $6100 on it and have nothing to show for it.  He convinces Nora to 'skip Christmas' by taking a cruise and not partaking in all of the usual holiday events.<br />The people that they encounter as they try to skip Christmas is hilarious.  These people in this town are just looney over Christmas.<br />I really enjoyed this book. This is the first John Grisham book that I have ever read.  While I know that it is nothing like his law thrillers, I was impressed with the story.  It was a short and quick read and perfect for that holiday read.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was on my way home one day when I heard \\"Don't Know Why\\" on the radio while randomly flipping channels.  Instead of going home, I went straight to the music store for the album.  I have to disagree with Amazon.com's editorial reviewer when he says \\"Jones's own material, while not bad, pales a bit next to masterpieces such as these.\\"  I appreciate artists who write their own material, and in my opinion the best two songs on the disc are the ones she wrote.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" simply blows me away--that song makes me wish I weren't married so I could use that song to court someone.  I wait eagerly to see what Ms. Jones comes up with next, and hope desperately that her next album includes more original material of this same caliber.
B000002J1L|4.0|Not my favorite Genesis album but after a few listens it started to grow on me a little better. Fountain of Salmacis is one of my favorite genesis songs. Its got alot more structure then most of the longer songs on this cd. The musical Box is a classic and even the shorter songs are quite good. All in all, you should own this cd to hear where these great musicians really started to form their styles.
B00005O3VC|3.0|If you've been waiting for this movie on dvd, get it.  The extras are no big deal, honestly.  The movie quality looks good though.  I'm glad I bought it.
B000003Z12|5.0|I bought this CD shortly after it became available.  It sounded alright but didn't really grab me.  I taped about 2 or 3 songs off it, shelved it and that's where it stayed till just a month or two ago.  I read other reviews about it and thought I'd give it another listen.  These songs don't need vocals, Neal Schon's guitar does the singing.  Many guitarists can't keep a listener's attention throughout a whole song, they need a vocalist to help them out.  But these songs speak to you and become more pronounced as you grow accustomed to the melodies.  I wish rock music had gone more in this direction.
B0000070QS|5.0|This guy continues to amaze and surprise, especially<br />with this mid 90's collection. Harket paints his<br />melancholy canvas with soul searching, at times<br />mellow but always inpired writing and arranging.<br />This one took me many repeated listenings to pull<br />out individual standouts, not a bad thing, I will<br />be listening to this one for years to come.  I like this cd as a whole,<br />he's a mesmerising vocalist and continues to mature<br />his craft. Listening to the new A-ha Cds I can hear<br />so much of this new direction Harket aims for here on &quot;Wild Seed&quot;.  I hope he makes more solo<br />releases in the future. My favorite cuts &quot;Brodsky Tune&quot;,<br />&quot;Spanish Steps&quot;, the beautiful prayer,&quot;Lay me down tonight&quot;,<br />&quot;Ready to go home&quot;, &quot;A kind of Christmas Card&quot;, &quot;Tell<br />me what you see&quot;, &quot;Los Angles&quot;. This is a must have for<br />any A-ha fans, pricey and not so easy to find but well<br />worth the discovery. Harket is one of the best vocalist<br />to come out of the last several decades. Nothing phoney<br />about this guy, he IS a SINGER.
0786867973|5.0|This book is not only a great baking book but a wonderful, entertaining read as well.  Anyone who thinks they could NEVER be a domestic goddess should buy this book.  It has seduced me to the pleasure of baking--from a loaf of bread to the accomplishment of making a cheese cake.  I have gotten so many compliments on the desserts that I've made from this book.  I love Nigella!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|the cynicism & cruely in this movie really turned me off.  i turned it off about half-way through despite wanting to hear the placement of a favorite song (by rufus wainwright).<br />the scene with the bluebird of happiness particularly offended, but i thought the jokes were cheap, the dialogue lame, & the message cynical.
B000069HKH|4.0|While it is easy to cast an uncritical eye at The Rising out of respect for its subject material, it is still appropriate to evaluate it in the context of Springsteen's earlier works.  It doesn't take long to realize that The Rising is a worthy addition to the Springsteen catalog in all aspects except one.<br />From a songwriting point of view, it's clear that Springsteen has lost little of his skill.  His penchant for creating memorable characters is vividly on display throughout The Rising.  The best example of such a memorable character can be found in the haunting \\"Nowhere Man\\", which gains its strength from the humbleness that Springsteen imbues on the song's object.  Well defined characters can also be found on \\"Worlds Apart\\", \\"You're Missing\\", and \\"The Rising.\\"<br />Another area where The Rising is the equal to Springsteen's earlier works is in the musicianship behind the recording.  Much (if not all) of the credit for this quality can be attributed to the E Street Band's powerful performance.  Their skill adds a much needed toughness to \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\".  Their skill also takes a potentially weak song like \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\" and makes it a memorable tune.<br />Where The Rising falls short is in the production choices.  There are occasions where the song's tempo is a total mismatch with the tone of the lyrics.  Such a mismatch is found on \\"Empty Sky.\\"  The song's lyrics call out for a slow rendition to better display its power.  But, it would seem that a decision was made to give this song a faster tempo because there was already one slow song on the recording dealing with someone being prematurely taken away.  The same mismatch between tempo and lyrics can be found on \\"Counting on a Miracle\\".  Even worse though is the inability of the production to elevate marginal songs.  \\"Mary's Place\\" is a great example of this flaw.  It's obvious that this tune was meant to be the recording's obligatory Springsteen party song.  However, the version that ended up on The Rising does nothing to inspire a party like atmosphere.  Springsteen sounds bored singing it and the band sounds bored playing it.  Instead of finding a way to make the song seem fresh, the one that ends up on The Rising simply sounds like a tired rehash of older and better Springsteen party anthems.  <br />Given the emotional undercurrents in The Rising, it is easy to believe that this work could be another Springsteen classic.  The songwriting and the musicianship do nothing to undermine this impression.  However, the production choices do undercut The Rising's power.  While it is still a very good album, The Rising's production shortcomings cause it to fall short of being the classic it could have been.
B00000JMQE|5.0|Sometimes wonderful things aren't wrapped in shiny wrapping. Such is Return to Oz which finds a happy, realistic, medium between the 1939 film and L. Frank Baum's books. The grenadine has been sucked out, but remnants of the 1939 film still remain (such as the RUBY slippers). What we find could be another socio-commentary film - the aftermath of growing up and child-hood dreams (or the reality of child-hood dreams revisted -  that not everything is as it seemed). Fairuza Balk is beautiful and real in her creation of Dorothy - the score is haunting and has some of the same orchestral beauty of Arthur Freed's 1939 score. Some issues in this movie are not for kid's who grow up on Gumby and Barney - but if you wanna jolt your kid into reality at an early age - this flick is for them.
B0000399WC|5.0|I saw the movie for the first time when I was about 12 yrs old and loved it! Now at 34 yrs old I 've probably seen this movie now about 40 times and each time is as good as the first!<BR>Since then about 2 years ago I was finally able to get a copy of the book \\"Papillon\\" by Henri Charriere (Papillon) in English and found this book to be also one of the best books I've ever read! Yes the movie has it's differences and to be exactly like the book it would of been another hour longer(which I would of had no problem with). If you like movies about history, people overcoming great odds,human bonding and even adventure this movie has it all.<BR>  This movie is not only a MUST see it is a MUST own!!!
B000075BFK|5.0|This cd is amazing.... The lyrics are incredible and i think any one with struggles in life can relate
B00006RU5B|1.0|I was hoping a combination of Chris Cornell and Rage would of produced a better album ! It's ok but Chris conned them into putting a couple of bad style songs he put on his 2 solo cds!<br />Hopefully next time they can do better!
B00006G8O1|5.0|I'm reduced to silly exclamations after watching Donnie Darko. I won't try to explain it -- I can only say it leaves me both baffled and excited, and I want to watch it again! This is the most strikingly original film I've seen in years and, though \\"nobody\\" saw it when it was released (it was lost in the post-9/11 haze), it is undoubtedly a cult favorite now and will only grow in stature. Some very fine acting here, with special praises for the magnificent Mary McDonnell, one of our most versatile, masterful and under-rated actors.
B000001FI7|5.0|You want to get yourself into a zone, stay awhile and be a better person for it. Portishead fits the bill at the top. The price you spend for the transition is minute compared to the pure enjoyment that becomes priceless. All the cuts intertwine into such a colour of sensual earfullness getaway. Mysterons, fine tunes your attention into such a mello, into Sour Times more beatiness, Wandering Star so smokiness like a caberet dancers hairpiece, be there: do that!
B00004T8RK|5.0|After escaping the notion that Pearl Jam's Commercial hit album &quot;Ten&quot; would never ever be reproduced.  It make's me happy.  Even though it is very good album, and their second best album, you don't really hear Pearl Jam's hearts in their music, until they escaped that Commercial style sound.  They do that after Vs (originally titled Five against One.)  but you can really hear the true feelings of Pearl Jam's work in Vitalogy, No Code, Yield and especially Binaural.  This album is a beautiful blend of poetic lyrics and soothing guitar rhythms and it's a must have.  It tops all their previous albums and even their more recent great album Riot Act.  5/5!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is fantastic!  This is one that will probably remain in my CD player for a long time.  Some of the songs are a bit reminiscent of 60s/70s classic rock, but all in all there is a unique sound that you won't find in any of the junk that is played on the radio today.  You can compare John's voice to Dave Matthews all you want, but the music is in a league of its own.  I look forward to hearing more from this talented musician!
0425107469|5.0|Of all the books I've read, including all of Dean Koontz's, this is my most favorite.  I completely loose track of everything around me when I open this story.  A MUST read!!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I absolutely love this album.  I even think Ewan McGregor's version of &quot;My Song&quot; is better than Elton John's!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not have all of the songs from the movie.  As another reviewer said, they should come out with a &quot;More Moulin Rouge&quot; so they can put the other great songs and mixes from the movie that were left off. (Such as Zidler's rap-mix with Lady M., all the versions of Come What May and John Leguizamo's Nature Boy.)
0064409422|5.0|OK, First you should know that this is an awesome book.  Its full of all different kinds of new and exciting adventures. This book, once you start reading it, you won't want to stop. There are so many different little conflicts here and there and there is always something exciting going on.  You never get bored with this book. Once I read it I couldn't stop.  And if you like this  book you should try all the other books in this series. Eventhough this book is all about getting lost in another world, and fantasies and creatures that aren't real, I am sure that you could relate to it yourself. There is such good detail. I highly recommend this book to younder readers and adults even. And also the rest of the series. It is fun an exciting so read it!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I'm always skeptical of new artists who tries to remake the old swing standards from the 1940s and 50s but Robbie Williams (formerly of 'Take That') have makes these standards rang for the Generation Xers! His &quot;Something Stupid&quot; duet w/Nicole Kidman is an excellent retake of Frank/Nancy duets (and Nicole could sing too). Also his version of Sinatra's &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot; (duet w/ the maestro himself), &quot;One for My Baby&quot; and &quot;Have You Met Ms. Jones?&quot; (from Bridget Jones' Diary) are also well arranged and well done. Finally, his take on Bobby Darin's &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, &quot;Things&quot;, and &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; are brilliant, almost matching Darin's versions of them. Overall, a well done album (too bad that Robbie's not as well known in the US as he is known in UK, Aussie, and the rest of the world) and I highly recommend it to any swing fan who wants to hear an updated version of the Sinatra, Darin, and the Rat Pack standards for the 21st Century. Well done, pallie!!
B00004S367|5.0|This CD is pure Stevie.  I must admit that I am still in the process of \\"discovering\\" Stevie Wonder (I only have this album and the 5 that follow) and so far I feel that \\"Music of My Mind\\" and \\"Songs In the Key of Life\\" are the best.<br />\\"Music...\\" is incredible from beginning to end.  It is a cohesive album that flows entirely.  Every song is great.  After listening to it only a few times, I was already singing along with it.  I felt as though I had heard all the songs before I had ever heard them (you know what I mean?).  Fantastic melodies which are so much fun to listen to (and sing!).  <br />I myself play music and this album is incredibly challenging, but at the same time very simple.  I would recommend this album purely for the musicianship and more importantly the songwriting aspects.  The chord changes are crazy!!  The melodies are perfect!!  All of it is beautifully produced and sounds crisp and new.  I heard this for the first time 30 years after it was released and it is still applicable in every way music can be applied; musicians and non alike.<br />For weeks, I would play the disc in my car while going out on the town and all of my friends love it and want it!!...  I can't say how much this album means to me.  It really gets me going in all sorts of ways be they happy, sad, ready to party, ready to cry, nostalgic, or optimistic.  It really is a positive sound without being corny or sappy.  This and \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" are really some albums you can fall in love with.  I can't remember finding an album that I could just listen to over and over and each time it would get better and better.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ESSENTIAL??  YUP.
B000062XGD|1.0|I watched on TV.  Thanks God!!!  After 3 hours the director gave us an open ending!!!  Maybe I'm not that good criticizing movies, but this one is bad, is a slow movie, a long one, and didn't go anywhere.
0553381709|4.0|I won't write anything new about this book, since there are a myriad of other reviews that capture the essence of this series. I did find the first two books in the series just a wee bit more enjoyable, thus the four star rating. If I could have, I'd have rated this book at 4.9 stars. In any case, it still is, simply put, a wonderful book and a great read. It also stays relatively true to the incredible world vision that emerged in \\"A Game of Thrones.\\" I'll also add that by the time you finish reading this volume, you'll still be thirsting for more, i.e., the next installment in this epic doorstopper series, \\"A Feast For Crows.\\"<br />READ THIS WARNING---- I just perused Martin's official website and as of today's date (12/03/03), Martin has not even finished writing \\"A Feast For Crows.\\" So why does Amazon[.com] have this listed as a preorder? Martin says he has no page count, he is trying to finish AFFC as fast as he can, but, I repeat, it is NOT finished! Martin also addresses the Amazon[.com] error and has no idea where their information comes from. He also adds that the only thing finished is the cover art. At least Amazon[.com] got that right! So, prepare for a major disappointment if you think you'll be getting your new copy on the date Amazon[.com] cites as the release date.<br /> In conclusion, I would have put this review with the \\"A Feast for Crows\\" listing, as Amazon[.com] usually allows reviews to be printed before a product is actually even available to the public. For some reason, they don't allow it for AFFC. I wonder why? Needless to say, we all would love to get our hands on a copy as soon as we can, BUT Amazon[.com's] erroneous listing of \\"A Feast For Crows\\" is a tease we all could do without.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam has been one of my favorite all time bands since they put out Vs...Yes 10 was Great, but alot of bands can do one great record. In my mind PJ never came in less then a 4. Unfortunetly, their early &quot;tag&quot; of Grunge earned them the scorn of the very &quot;Classic Rock&quot; fans who would enjoy much of their later work and sense we are no longer in the 91's they are irrelevant to the teenagers...however, this CD is rich, deep, and moving.<br />Can't Keep - Opens a little like &quot;poor Tom&quot; of Zep fame<BR>Save You - Moving Rocker that seems to be about an intervention<BR>Love Boat Captain - Stand out ballad that to me is the best song on the CD<BR>I am Mine - The first single and the hook is why<BR>Thubimg My Way Back to Heaven - Great accustic Neil Youngish Track<BR>All or None - Mellow Closer with great bluesy guitar.<br />This CD lacks the &quot;Sing along&quot; choruses of earlier works.

0553260111|4.0|Critical Review:  The Bourne Identity<BR> In my opinion, after reading this book, I feel that Robert Ludlum is the proverbial father of suspense, holding his own with such writers as Alfred Hitchcock and Stephen King.  The book, the first of a trilogy is written magnificently leaving endless opportunities to expand on future sequels.  Ludlum has an uncanny way of grabbing the reader's attention and keeping him eager to continue.  The plot thickens early, wasting no time to express deep thought.  The author leaves much to decipher, not spoon-feeding information; done commonly in less quality works of literature, boring the reader to exhaustion.<BR>Jason Bourne the protagonist has a very disguised role in the novel.  Although struck with amnesia, Bourne has a very smooth and calm way of executing his actions.  Bourne's ability to stay mild mannered is a perfect counter balance to all the far-fetched and extravagant plots that arise throughout the course of the novel. <BR>Throughout the novel uncertainty keeps the reader intrigued.  Bourne is constantly fighting a battle; not always physically with other characters, rather mentally against himself.  The never-ending dilemma between good and evil is a major factor in this book.  Slowly learning more about his past, Bourne is realizing the life he led is not the one he wants to lead.  From this point on in the book, Bourne is fighting to get out of the line of work that made him into what he is. \\"Jason Bourne had been paid to kill, and the police in several countries had sent funds through Interpol to convert reluctant informers, to broaden the base of his capture (Ludlum, 94).\\"  With the help of Marie St. Jacques Bourne starts his transformation.  In reality, The Bourne Identity is an incredible suspense thriller, but if you take a closer look, its really just your basic stereotypical love story with many obstacles and twists, boy meets a girl, boy has four million dollars, boy asks girl to drive him to Paris, and theyfall in love.   <BR>Bourne, right off the bat, is portrayed as a superhero, almost immortal, having the ability to endure the icy wrath of the ocean and the lead that is temporarily residing in his head. \\"The boat rolled violently leeward and the and the man whose skull was ripped open plugged over the over the side into the madness of the darkness below (Ludlum, 1).\\" Bourne's flawless execution is a little overdone at times and casts a shadow of artificiality on the storyline. The novel is quite unrealistic at times though, for example, Bourne's amnesia was in a sense limited, his name, age, identity were all lost in his accident, but his ability to combat was in tact as well as his illusive clever nature. \\"Jason dropped to a crouch, spun to his left and lunged out of the aisle between two adjacent cars, breaking his fall with the palms of his hands, the maneuver made in silence (Ludlum, 426).\\" <BR>To conclude, The Bourne Identity is a literary masterpiece, setting a mold for all future suspense thrillers to come. The book is directed towards more of an intellectual audience, with gaps in the story that only your imagination can fill. Each person will take his or her own individual thoughts and opinions from this book. I stand strong behind this book, and would recommend it to all readers with interest in deep thought and suspense.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira is a wonderful singer she has a very strong voice and with this adventage you can do almost everything.<BR>The first time that I heard from her was back in 1996 when she was enjoying the first hit of her career, her smash hit &quot;Estoy aqui&quot; and I had the change to go to one concert of her in my country and I also had the change to meet her.<BR>During the years she had realesed several albums from all of them I like the most 1996's &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; I've heard this album I don't know how many times and I still enjoy it when I hear it, she didn't make it bad in 1998 when she realesed &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot;, this album from my point of view was been made through the vision of &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; but it had to be better so the producer was Emilio Estefan Jr. one of the most important producers in latin music but the album became too comercial and this happends all the time and also happends with movies that had been blockbusters and the they make the sequel and it's not the same, but in this case the difference was that the album became a hit and sold more than &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; but the reason of this wasn't because just of the album were the influences of the producer, Shakira was more famous and her MTV unplugged was was the last touch to that success, talking about the MTV unplugged, Shakira realesed a cd from that unplugged and let me say that the quality of voice of Shakira was better but the production was a mess, was terrible I mean was the re-realese of her album &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot; because she sang all the songs from the album and &quot;estoy aqui&quot;and she left behind lots of hits such as: &quot;donde estas coraazon&quot;, &quot;antologia&quot;, &quot;un poco de amor&quot;, &quot;pies descalzos&quot; and &quot;Se quiere-se mata&quot; for me that's the worst MTV unplugged in the hole history maybe the producers can say that was good becuase of the sales but I insist the production was amess.<BR>In 2001 as everybody knows she realesed &quot;Laundry service&quot; her first english album I like this album, the singles are the best songs, Shakira's prononciation is not very good but she did it alright.<BR>My final thought is that Shakira is very talented but she needs  better producers and know that she is famous all over the world and had sold albums as ice- creams in summer it's time fror her to think about her production and not just to sell and sell albums just &quot;making them&quot;.<BR>I rate this CD with 3 stars because it has a good quality and has good songs as: &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Whenever, wherever&quot;, &quot;Underneath you clothes&quot;, &quot;Poem to a horse&quot; and &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot;.<BR>And i think that the translations from the covers are better good because it's not and easy or sometimes possible work.
6304184832|4.0|This was a good movie. Intriguing storyline, impressive cast, believable (and likable) characters, plenty of excitement, and even a subplot of romance. Admittedly, not all of the \\"very bad weather\\" that earned it the PG-13 rating was completely realistic...but what can you expect? CGI animation was still very new at the time.<br />However, there's one problem: The movie was edited for length. Most of what was deemed nonessential was still another entire subplot--one involving the rival storm-chaser team (led by Cary Elwes, playing an antagonist who's not quite evil enough to be called a villain) and revealing their actual agenda.<br />But the editors didn't entirely succeed at what they attempted to do--that is, cut out the entire rival storm-chaser team apart from Elwes and Zach Grenier. <br />Which is why there are a few scenes that involve Abraham Benrubi (the only other actor from Elwes's team whose name I can recall right off the bat) looming imposingly behind Elwes, or some other fresh-faced thirtysomething smirking in the background. Their characters have names, and are listed fairly early in the end credits...but they seem to be little more than walk-ons. If a Director's Cut of this movie is ever released, I want it.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you're a true jazz lover, this LP, CD or cassette is in your collection.  Backed by musical greats John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly, Miles set the standard for what &quot;cool&quot; is.  &quot;So What?&quot; is the anthem for late 50's jazz music.  In my opinion, the greatest recording of all time.
0375823360|5.0|This is the closest thing to a \\"Rowling meets Tolkien\\" epic I have found. Pullman takes us on a thrilling ride, seen through the eyes and world(s) of young Lyra. Her quest to find out the truth about her parents and to help her father quickly turns into a life-and-death encounter with countless \\"baddies\\" and many new friends. Her far-reaching adventures are sure to please readers fascinated by intertwined worlds, witches, magical gadgets, pseudo-science, and retro-tech visions of zeppeliners in combat with talking bears. Pullman's concept of daemons - basically souls incarnate as animal companions - is brilliantly executed and plays a central role in the story.<br />But thankfully, Pullman wants to do more than just entertain with some fancy antics in a fantasy world. The underlying plot is about budding adolescense and the ensuing loss of innonence (and beginning of responsibility), the fundamental conflicts between good and evil, faith and facts, sin and free will, and as he moves towards the conclusion of the trilogy, Pullmans's rooting in classic english literature as well as his courageous ambition to make a controversial point becomes clear. The series quite successfully raises questions about authority, power and destiny, and the fact that the story sheds light on the hypocrisy and dubious morals of the church and questions the value of dogmatic religion may well rattle some parents and unprepared readers alike.<br />Beware, people get maimed and die, children are orphaned and scared, the good turn out bad and it's all quite a bit more realistic (for want of a better word) and nuanced than in the world of Harry Potter. On the other hand, there is less of Tolkien's (in some people's opinion) long-winded poetry, and the resulting balance is sure to please many.
0345350499|5.0|This is the tale that first got me into the Arthurian legends and I've loved it ever since.  You'll notice that Marion Zimmer Bradley doesn't quite keep to the myth and often goes off in her own directions, but that's what makes this story so interesting and unique.  It has a flavor to it that is hard to resist.  Once you start, you won't want to stop!  Take my word for it, this book is one in a million and definately worth the money.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton does things differently here...He writes the entire story in first-person; he starts off with family life; he merely hints at the trouble to come. Having read almost all his fiction works, I found this story as engaging as ever.<br />We start off with Jack and Julia, a modern couple facing problems of family life. Jack is at home with the kids, while Julia deals with mounting work pressures and the possibilities for infidelity. Although both Jack and Julia have experience in groundbreaking technology, their story begins in a setting familiar to all, thus adding weight to the coming suspense.<br />Don't be mistaken, though; the suspense will come, and the usual technological ideas will reign. A highly-evolved swarm of nanoparticles has escaped from a secretive lab, and they are responding to predator-prey programming that Jack helped develop and Julia helped perfect. Along the way, Jack will be called in to help coordinate the counterattack against the swarm--if he and his team don't first become the prey.<br />This book starts off with more heart than usual for a Crichton book. I was fully involved by the time the true troubles came. The applications to society and technology are worthwhile to consider, and Crichton pulls out a few surprises by the end.<br />What he fails to do--to my chagrin--is sustain the sense of family and familiarity with which he starts the story. The concern we have for his kids soon falls away into a plot contrivance, and we find ourselves squarely in the middle of a regular Crichton story. A fun and fast-paced story it is, but it could've been even better if he continued with the human angle. Eventually, when the worst of the death toll hits, we find ourselves caring only on a superficial level. In fact, even Jack shows little emotional response.<br />Was I breathless at the climax? Yes. Did I actually care? Nah, not much. After all was said and done, it was a one-night stand of a book.  I felt like rolling over, lighting a cigarette, and trying not to consider the horrible consequences of Crichton's technology run-amok.tte, and trying not to consider the horrible consequences of Crichton's technology run-amok.

B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna's GHV2 lacks with no new material, an uninspired name, and the fact that the songs are not remixed or badly chopped up. But that is all, the liner notes are funny and the pictures are wonderful (around 600 pictures of this beautiful woman). This album should have been put in cronological order with some differences with maybe keeping &quot;Music&quot; as the last track, it would have flowed better. This album cut songs for time, they botched &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and should have put &quot;Rain&quot; on there. Also some remixes would have been good, say had they remixed &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; or &quot;Erotica&quot; but overall it's an album from an artist that pushes the limits and does a great job of that, she is inspired... well most the time.

B000002KAG|5.0|If you care about the Dead at all, you need their first record.  Word was that Jerry didn't really want to release this album because he didn't think the band was ready.  In retrospect it's clear that Jerry was ready.  At this point the band was a quartet with deep roots in the blues and American folk music.  That was their reputation even before they had a reputation.  One night when I was at the Matrix, a San Francisco club, one of the customers urged Garcia to play some blues, meaning some more formally identifiable 12-bar blues or a Chicago blues, and Garcia told him, &quot;The last four songs were blues.&quot;  And they were.  The Dead were never far from blues as this collection shows.  From Jesse Fuller's &quot;Beat It on Down the Line&quot; the effect is present.  Pigpen's &quot;Good Morning, Little School Girl&quot; would play well in Chicago's South Side, particularly with his harmonica, and &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; is practically a standard.  The band was ready.  Listen to Lesh's base line and Kreutzmann's drums and Pigpen's organ on &quot;Cold Rain and Snow&quot; and the tight shuffle in &quot;Sitting on Top of the World.&quot;  And hear Garcia's guitar--clean and quick even as it fades off into the recording studio.  This was a band ready to become, and this debut album announced that to the world.  The only question was what they were to become.  Despite the impressive lead work, &quot;Cream Puff War&quot; is a little too much like the lesser San Francisco sound (psychedelic, anyone?), but &quot;Morning Dew,&quot; &quot;New, New Minglewood Blues,&quot; and &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot; are benchmarks--songs that remained in the repertoire for the life of the band.  In some respects, the band was never as ready as on this album because despite the reported hastiness of the recording, their music is careful and planned.  Garcia may have surpassed the inventiveness of the solos on this album, but I'm not sure that he was ever more disciplinedin his playing.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Bought this CD in Summer of 1999, and it's still in my CD player!  Saw her live in Minneapolis in 2000, and can't wait to hear her new CD.  She played a couple tracks off the forthcoming album including one called &quot;When I Sleep&quot; which was amazing.  She also signed autographs after the show and was so gracious!  If you don't already own this one, buy it NOW!
B00003CWL6|5.0|WELL beyond five stars for this opus of fracturing domesticity circa late 1999 - although Jack Lemon, Shirley Maclaine, Burt Lancaster, Anthony Perkins and Natalie Wood would have carried this movie to stardom and beyond - were it made let's say 45 years ago ...... with Sue Lyon subbing Mena Suvari.<br />Bows to Mr. Mendez for this jewel - excellently presented on this pristine DVD! Reminds of \\"Rebel without a Cause\\" - slight nod to Dean's gender-confusd papa.<br />Mandatory viewing for all!
B00006RU5B|5.0|An unbelievable sophisticated album.  Cornell's influence on the remaining three members of Rage Against the Machine is great.  I think in many ways, Zack de la Roche's departure lets the band develop in ways they could not have.  del la Roche pushed them towards rap, while current, is primitive and not the right vehicle for a guitar/bass combo that rivals any other in history.  Morello's exploratory licks really need the heavy blues base that is apparant in this album.  I will not waste time with comparisons to Rage or Soundgarden.  Instead look way back to Black Sabath &amp; Zeppelin.
B00006IUOZ|2.0|I will try not to title the review with any references to sleep, or lack of it. Nor will I mention things like Al Pacino sleepwalking through his role. But it seems that this film was shot to make you have empathy with the lead character, a cop who has insomnia in a land where the sun never sets. Pacino does a credible job as a cop who really needs a good snooze, but all the pacing did for me was make me want to nap myself, and that's the problem. <br />The disappointment is that I was looking forward to the movie, especially the interaction with the killer. This is not the first movie that Al Pacino plays a cop who verbally confronts the bad guy before the inevitable violent end. He did it in \\"Heat\\" with Robert DiNiro, and in that picture there was blazing chemistry. Once again, maybe it's the sleep thing, but I really think the whole insomnia issue prevents any real electricity from happening. <br />I would have liked to have seen the movie redone without the whole lack of sleep thing. It drains the energy from the film. Robin Williams has shown he's a good dramatic actor, and can make a great villain, but let's try it again some time with Pacino in something different.
0316666343|2.0|Well I agree with the rest of you on this...I bought the book because I kept seeing it on the best-seller list.  I kinda read what it was about, but wondered what all the hype was???  I wasn't real thrilled with it at all.  A dog finding nothing but her elbow?  Is that supposed to be funny?  I didn't even pass it on to anybody in my family.  They would probably find me &quot;strange&quot; for even attempting to get into a novel like that.
0066214122|1.0|Disappointing page turner.  Thin characters and totally improbable situations make this most recent Crichton scifi effort a waste of time.  At least wait until the paperback comes out; save your money even with the generous Amazon.com promotion.

B000069CWE|4.0|Linkin Park is probably one of the best bands out to-date,and though many people would prefer Hybrid Theory over this album,this album is still really good.Most bands lose points trying to &quot;reanimate&quot; (or remix) their music,but that is where Linkin Park is different. They did a really good job on this album,and I think most fans will probably enjoy it.The albums best track is &quot;1stp Klosr&quot; because I feel they did a really good job collaborating with Jonathan Davis. Overall I would recommend this album with all its tight remixs.
1891252089|5.0|Worth the cover price alone for the photo of Doug Swenson practicing along the mountain ridges of Lake Tahoe on page 242. Were his life insurance provider aware of this shot, I guarantee his policy would be dropped immediately.<br />The other pages prove to be possibly the only book you really need on the physical exercise of yoga. While David Life and Sharon Gannen's excellent Jivamukti Yoga emphasizes the origins and much of the spiritual aspects for today's practitioner in clear, modern language (The Yoga Sutras are, after all, pretty dense stuff), Swenson's focus is the asanas, and the primary and intermediate series of the ashtanga yoga system.<br />The asanas are presented in clear, concise detail, along with photos. <br />The book does not intimidate by bogging the reader down in overly long details in either words or pictures. When explaining the translation of an asana's sanskrit name, instead of getting \\"This very interesting posture has an equally interesting history to its' names origin. In 436 BC, the first king of scotland travelled to india, etc. etc.\\", Swenson simply writes \\"Pada=Foot\\" (But if it is gorgeous, unbelievably crisp photos of asana practice you're looking for, the book to get is Linda Sparrowe's Yoga).<br />One does not need to practice ashtanga for this book to prove useful and inspirational: virtually every asana is displayed, so even if you prefer a vinyasa practice, you can always pick up some new - or remind yourself of many - poses within. (The wisely included index also proves mega-useful in this regard)<br />The book is also practical: not only does it display abrdged versions of the the series for the time-tied, but also because it has a unique spiral hardcover binding and displays one asana per page, making it easy to keep the book beside your mat for reference without it flipping shut every two seconds as you practice. <br />(Anyone who's ever had that experience knows it feels something akin to what Doug Swenson on the aforementioned page 242 is doing, with potentially far more fatal results)(Try transcending THAT!).
B00006690G|4.0|This album is probably the best of the three albums put out by Eminem! ... All the songs on this album are undeniably good (and funny) but the best songs have to be \\"Superman\\",\\"My Dads Gone Crazy\\", and I really liked tracks like \\"Drips\\". The whole album is good,and overall no matter how much people try to deny it Eminem is truly a lyrical genius. I would recommend this to anyone not afraid to know what REAL musicians think!!!
B0000029AP|5.0|Whoa...just listening to the muddy guitars and the raw-throated vocals, there is no doubting the band's assertions that they were once massive coke fiends.  I mean, this is the sound of a band that's sitting in the control room, listening to the playbacks, and going, &quot;KILLER tune, Joe!&quot; &quot;Great vocals, Steve!&quot;  &quot;Dude, you know, it's pretty obvious...WE are the GREATEST rock band in the world!&quot;  &quot;You know it, man!  Pass that mirror over here!&quot;<br />Thing is, with this album, they were absolutely right.  The tracklisting virtually reads like a greatest hits album already: the title track (featuring a frantic riff and lyric and a killer bass solo), Uncle Salty and Adam's Apple (featuring Tyler vocals that are at once repulsive and laviscious), Walk This Way (a tune so great that no amount of redundant Super Bowl duets with Justin and Britney could mar), Big Ten Inch Record (the band at thier loosest and funniest), Sweet Emotion ('nuff said), the sing-along of No More No More, the claustrophobic paranoia of Round and Round, and the ballad You See Me Crying.<br />As far as I'm concerned, once you have this album, you've completed your Aerosmith library.  It's from the days (and daze) when their muse was something darker and more inspiring than Desmond Child.

6301963717|5.0|You won't see a movie next year or the next that will beat this one.  Miller's Crossing doesn't contain a bad frame of photography, a poor word of dialogue, or a momentary slack in the level of acting.  Plus, it's full of absolutely classic gangster-movie moments.  The intricacy of the plot will be only one of the reasons you'll want to see it multiple times.  It's eye candy, ear candy, brain candy.<br />Gabriel Byrne shines as the Christ figure Tom Reagan (everyone exclaims \\"Jesus, Tom\\" to him throughout the movie), who sacrifices himself, his girlfriend, his career, and his friendships to \\"put things right\\" for Leo.  Albert Finney is amazing as Leo, the fading Irish Prohibition-era mob boss who's going soft but still can rise to the fire of his younger days (\\"the old man is still an artist with the Thompson\\").  John Turturro (as usual) turns in a brilliant acting job playing the \\"shmatte kid\\" Bernie Birnbaum.  J. E. Freeman (the Dane) will make you wet your pants when he approaches with a long-barreled pistole.  Marcia Gay Harden smokes the screen and discombobulates Tom's heart as the sultry Verna.  And Joe Polito is hilarious as the greaseball Johnny Casper (Giovanni Gasparo) who carries out murdeous plots while dim-wittedly trying to analyze the \\"ethics\\" of each situation.<br />Don't miss it.
B00006J3T4|5.0|With Golden Heart and Sailing to Philadelphia, Mark Knopfler introduced us to a much mellower and surprisingly understated dimension of his art. The man who had gloriously fronted Dire Straits as its sonic and lyrical architect, had finally begun to attempt and excel at what critics had already foreseen: a soulful dip into calmer, more retrospective music that efficiently and amusingly charts the mysterious borderlands of unmistakable Geordie influences and slow rock, reminding us of Knopfler's long cherished ambition of creating a platform where the Delta and Tyne can meet. And where these two meet, Knopfler fishes, and how! With the winning dexterity and fantastic precision that only the very best minds in the business have been able to draw from, Knopfler with The Ragpicker's Dream brings to light once again his passion for roots - and his undying love affair with studying and chronicling these roots across a vast tapestry comprising experience, musical slant, character and the elusive search for home.  <br />In The Ragpicker's Dream, Knopfler's trademark style shines through with increased amplitude and impact:  <BR>1) His undeniably brilliant capacity for fusing folk, rock and country and this time, also managing to add a powerful blues undercurrent, not to mention the veritable dash of jazz<BR>2) His ability to seamlessly weave stories into his lyrics, stories that superbly evoke images from times and places that we seem, strangely enough, to be familiar with<BR>3) His guitar that is achingly beautiful and now, easily a machine engineered for a controlled excellence only he can muster<BR>4) The ambience he creates with his elegantly sparse and highly sophisticated arrangements and styles. Knopfler's music is the neon-lit testament to the overwhelming force of minimalism. Less is indeed, more<BR>5) His voice: simultaneously soothing and energising as usual<br />I wont get into a critique of the songs themselves, listen to them yourself and don't miss the delightful opportunity of getting to sit back and lap up the magic as one of the greatest singers/songwriters/musicians of our times reaches for the full extent of his considerably amazing genius with the effortlessly classical touch of a master who knows how to optimally use his powers and the refreshingly contemporary flair of an experimenter who isn't wary of shaking the tree to see if there is something there he can find and use.  <br />This is vintage Knopfler. Worth every cent! Go Geordie go!
B00006L9ZT|4.0|\\"Ring\\" cycles are almost sure to inspire controversy.  The outrageous scenic demands, the fantasy elements, the horrific demands on the singers make it almost impossible to fully realize Wagner's vision.  And everyone who has tried to stage the operas has had to make compromises, gloss over difficulties, and make due with what they have at their disposal.  The Met Ring represents the neo-romantic approach to the operas, which for most casual viewers or opera \\"newbies\\" will probably make this the first choice for watching the cycle at home.  Granted, many critics and opera affecianatos have hated this production.  They have called it \\"too lush,\\" \\"too old fashioned\\" or \\"too easy.\\"  But it is these elements which will make the opera comprehensible to the newcomer.  Some of the more modern productions have been visually interesting, and indeed made the viewer rethink the story and its meaning to contemporary audiences.  But too often they zero in on one aspect or meaning to the expense of others.  Chereau's Industrial Ring was a fascinating production, but after awhile I couldn't get past some jarring inconsistencies, especially the clash between the fantasy elements and the gritty \\"real world\\" in which it was set.  Why would Alberich want to control a magic ring, when he could organize a union or lead a workers' revolt?  How is it that the world could progress into the Industrial Age but not understand the concept of money?  Does taking an elevator really convey the descent into the underground caverns of the dwarves?  And so on --  a mechanical dragon, the forging scene all seem even more silly when forced into \\"reality.\\"  Other staged productions fare no better... watching the laser show of another production brings to mind a late night stoner session watching Pink Floyd.  Others have twisted the story so much that characters show up at inappropriate (and unscripted) times, new endings are tacked on, and so forth... all in the name of making the operas \\"relevant.\\"  Herein lies the strength of the Met's production - it tries to bring Wagner's vision to life, not that of some ambitious director.  Set in a fantasy world of gods, heroes, and magic, the story flows more naturally and the elements have broader resonance.  The sets, lighting, and presentation of the opera are particular strengths of this DVD.  I doubt if the Rhineland has ever come to life in such a brilliant, visually stunning way, and those who fell under the spell of the recent \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies should find many similarities here.  The singing is not quite the caliber of the \\"golden age\\" but is generally fine.  Levine and the orchestra are in tip-top form here... rarely do opera's sound this good!  The acting is not this production's greatest strength, but several performers do quite well.  Ludwig, Morris, Beherns are quite good, an Jerusalem is one of the better Siegfrieds around.  Sure, viewers can ultimately move on to more complex productions, but this is the best place to start for those hoping to make that first plunge into Wagner's Ring.erein lies the strength of the Met's production - it tries to bring Wagner's vision to life, not that of some ambitious director.

B000067JHW|3.0|Amelie (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001)<br />For the past two years, I have been reading reviews of Amelie that all have one thing in common: the word \\"sweet.\\" I have no idea what film these people were watching, but it wasn't the twisted little minor gem I saw on Sunday night. \\"Sweet\\" may be the last word I'd have come up with in trying to describe it. I should have had more faith in the brilliance of Jeunet. (Of course, all of these same people persist in describing Audrey Tatou as anything from \\"pixie-like\\" to \\"gorgeous,\\" as well. I found her rather disturbing-looking, as I find everyone in Jeunet films.)<br />Throw the other reviews out and listen to me, will you? Amelie is the story of the title character (Audrey Tatou of Venus Beauty Institute), and there's actually precious little story. It's more a slice-of-life thing, during which she does such things as befriend a man with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Serge Melin of The City of Lost Children), try to set up some of her compatriots at work, torments the local grocer Collignon (Michel Robin, presently onscreen in America in Merci pour le Chocolat), and lead a hopelessly lovestruck guy from her grade-school class (Matthieu Kassovitz, from Jakob the Liar) on a wild goose chase to discover her identity. None of which is all that sweet a thing to do, really.<br />Jeunet's usual twisted sense of humor is evident here, and it rears its head often in visual clues (think Police Squad! for a more highbrow audience). The wit isn't as dry as usual, and thus the movie doesn't have as many laugh-out-loud funny points as Jeunet's finest film, Delicatessen. That doesn't make it unwatchable, but it does pale in comparison. Just be prepared to find a movie filled with subtly disturbing (especially in their appearance) people that will leave you scratching your head and wondering \\"what in the world was all that about?\\" ***
B000002MG1|4.0|A highpoint in REM's career, Automatic is thematically all about mortality and the beauty of life.  Released in the wake of Nirvana's Nevermind, Automatic show Stipe and company following their own muse and not kowtowing to trends and fads.  They know they are too old and have too much distance to approach their lives and art in that style and instead present a collection of moody, contemplative meditations and ruminations.  Lyrically, Stipe responds to Nirvana's worldview of \\"I only know pain and I hate myself and want to die\\" with gentle rebuffs and genuine concern.<br />Drive sets the tone: \\"Maybe I drive to get off\\".  The song's protagonist feels at his most comfortable and stimulated when between places, not actually connecting, because sometimes making those connections means accepting a whole lot of potential pain as well. <br />\\"Try Not To Breathe\\" follows that thread.  Told from the viewpoint of someone who is ready to take their life and leave this world, the protagonist communicates that (s)he has lived a full life and desires to face their mortality.  Peter Buck's feedback laden guitar provides the backdrop, both spooky and enveloping at once.<br />\\"Sidewinder\\" is the first upbeat song, and despite (valid) criticism from the band, it works well here - it sounds celebratory and reminds in a way that even at the most difficult times - like when you can't get through to someone over the phone and you don't know where else you can find a place to sleep that night - you can find a way to laugh about your difficulties.<br />Which provides the bridge to \\"Everybody Hurts\\".  Though played to death on radio and MTV at the time, I'm beginning to appreciate it again.  It's almost like the protagonist of \\"Sidewinder\\" trying to tell the narrator of \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" to keep going, despite all the hardships and pain that sometimes seem insurmountable.  \\"You're not alone,\\" croons Stipe, at his warmest and most gentle.<br />New Orleans Instrumental is SUPPOSED to be amood piece, but it's clumsy performance and lack of direction halt the momentum of the album, and, frankly, nothing is missed if you skip it.<br />Sweetness Follows is gorgeous.  Again, like Everybody Hurts, the singer says that no matter how hard it seems to get, keep going.  This time, though, the hurt and the need to rise above it all is more immediate: the mortality in question is one's parents, and though it's \\"these little things that can pull you under\\", in the end all you can do is not to despair and lose hope, but to \\"Live your life filled with joy and thunder\\".  Amazing performance by Buck here, dispensing with the usual, heard it before melodic guitar solo and providing another feedback filled bridge.<br />Monty Got A Raw Deal is a misdirection - a bad, silly riff with scattershot lyrics about Montgomery Clift (The Clash already nailed this subject, guys).  Neither lyrically nor muscially does this fit in with the feel of the rest of the album.<br />Ignoreland comes out of nowhere - it seems like the obligatory \\"Yes, this album is filled with personal ballads, but that doesn;t mean we've forgotten how to ROCK OUT to a political anthem. dude!\\"   song.  Silly, blatant chorus, trying to incite a call to arms with a chorus of repeated \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\"s.  (Nirvana already nialed this chorus, guys)  Not a particualrly good song, and it's just lost on this album.  <br />But the next four songs - Jesus! What a peak.  \\"Star Me Kitten\\" is spooky, Stipe's voice on the lyric \\"You...Me...We used to be...On Fire...\\" is...well, geez, does the dictionary have a word for something that's simultaneously as scary and sexy as anything you'll ever hear?<br />Man On the Moon may actually be the saddest song on the album - despite the feel-good, sing-along chorus (and a series \\"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\"s that actually do work this time).  \\"If you believe, there's nothing out there to see/Nothing that's cool\\" stipe sings in this ode to Andy Kaufman, but is really a balladfor anyone whoever felt that somehow - no matter how complete and fulfilled their life may seem, there still feels like something is missing.  It ends like a door being slammed shut in frustration and into a foreboding and uncertain future.  <br />Where to go from there but the albums' centerpeice, \\"Nightswimming\\".  \\"I'm not sure all these people understand/It's not like years ago\\" sings Stipe, recalling the simple pleasures from his youth.  Still, though that time is forever gone, the singer's warm recollection leaves the listener with no doubt that he is grateful for having had the experience, and that the memory of that time will forever keep him going.  A beautiful piano and vocal performance, it stands as one of the top five moments in R.E.M.'s catalog.<br />As does \\"Find the River\\", which completes the album and fibnds us back in the car with the singer of \\"Drive\\".  (\\"Hey, there, little speedy head, the meter on the speed meter says, you've got to go to task in the city\\")  The lyric communicates to not give up or lose faith, but to seek out what it is that will bring fulfillment and contentment into one's life.  And the little things in life?  Appreciate them, because \\"the river to the ocean goes\\" - or, little things add up and from them big things will come.  In other words, not to hide out (say, alone in a car), but to immerse yourself in the little beautiful things that this life can on occasion offer.<br />Visually, the photography inside the disc shows this in a wonderful shot of Stipe swimming in the ocean, as well as other shots of the band on the beach.  These shots - particularly the Stipe one -  justify the price and purchase of this disc in alone.<br />Gentle, beautiful, thoughful, inspriring.  A wonderful peak that will fit in comfortably with almost anyone's record collection.
0385508417|4.0|I enjoyed Grisham's book.  Luther and Nora decide to skip Christmas since this will be the first Christmas that their daughter, Blair will be away (she is in the Peace Corp in Africa).<br />Luther and Nora take the money they spend on a tree, gifts, and food and spend it on a cruise in which they depart on Christmas day.  The neighbors and their coworkers tend to give the Krank's a hard time about giving up on Christmas.<br />The story takes a turn and it becomes a Seinfeld episode, and I found it quite amusing.  The true spirit of Christmas comes through in the end and it was a lovely read.  A very different story from Grisham but I highly enjoyed it.
B000063UR1|4.0|Long a favorite of mine, this DVD version is very good. If nothing else, it shows how the cultural climate of the times finds its way into a movie. The &quot;Making of&quot; feature is almost worth the price itself.  Find out why the ship is named &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, and how they made those little robots work. While many slam the Joan Baez songs, I think they are the essence of the movie and convey the feelings of the time in which the movie was made.  In fact, I held back one star because they don't include the songs &quot;Rejoice in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Silent Running&quot; as separate cuts and the soundtrack album is long out of print.
B00005UKKF|2.0|Does anyone else feel like their being force fed this girl?  I gave this 2 stars because I love dancing & even thats getting old for her.  The same moves again and again......  Additionally, the singing/lip syncing leaves a lot to be desired too.  I just don't like singing/pre-recording when it sounds like someones sucked on a container of helium prior to the performance.  I'm sure others gave it a better rating not b/c of the singing but for pure visuals or adolesence.  To each his/her own.
B00005LQ04|4.0|Deciding to take previous reviwers advice, on how good this movie is i bought this movie becuase i just seen Jennifer Connelly in Phenomena, a 1985 Argento film.  I was creeped out and amazed on how eerie the movie was.  I particualrly enjoyed the score.  <br />Anyway, I started looking into this Dario Argento character and aparently he is a God in Italian cinema. Even though he is not too famous in the states the people who do watch his films love him. Kind of like the Those \\"Zombie freaks\\" that love Romero.<br />This apparently is his definitive masterpiece of a three part trilogy involving withces.(the third is not made yet)  The way this guy freaks you out and shoves the violence and suspense down your throat has been unseen before by me and quite frankly i enjoyed it. The score is scary as hell and the lighting will make you wish you stayed sober for the movie.  Each death scene has never been done before and beleive me you will want to take your eyes off of it.  The last 15 minutes of the movie will make you turn the light back on and lock the all the windows why you sit in your bed in silence trying to ponder what you just watched.
B00006IUOZ|2.0|Insomnia (Christopher Nolan, 2002)<br /><br />I hate to think it's true, but having now seen Chris Nolan's other two films, Following and Insomnia, I'm starting to think Memento--one of the finest films ever made--was a one-shot deal.<br /><br />Insomnia, based on Erik Skoldbjaerg's brilliant 1997 film starring Stellan Skarsjard (of Good Will Hunting and The Glass House). Nolan's version--executive-produced by professional remake mangler Steven Soderbergh, who should be boiled in his own juices for what he did to Solaris--puts an on-the-edge Al Pacino in Skarsjard's role, and Pacino is the best thing about this movie hands-down. It's the first time since Dog Day Afternoon that he's played a character who's this unhinged both in his head and by the events around him, and we, the viewing audience, have sorely missed Mr. Crazy Pacino, thankyouverymuch. Unfortunately, Pacino is not given nearly as much to work with as was Skarsjard, and what he is given is as anemic as a nineteenth-century hypochodriac prescribed a convalescence of a length to be determined. (If only someone had done the same for Nolan.)<br /><br />All of the motivation of Skarsjard's character has disappeared (some for the sake of'-ugh'-'streamlining,' and some because American audiences, according to Hollywood, would have a real problem seeing a character with some of Skarsjard's character's nastier qualities portrayed in anything like a positive light), all of the ambiguity of two key scenes (the shooting in the fog and the ride to the dump) have disappeared, a key scene showing the depth to which the detective has sunk is lessened in its intensity, and most heretically, the ending is destroyed, all of which lead to a film that, had it been made on its own, may have been watchable. As a remake, however, it pales, and greatly, in comparison to the brilliant force unleashed upon us by Erik Skjoldbaerg in 1997. **
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Okay, I agree, this movie was NOT all it was cracked up to be.  Still, after hearing so many people say how bad it was, it proved to be a good investment of an hour and twenty minutes.  Even if you don't like it, there is that one redeeming quality--it's less than 1 1/2 hours long.<br />I thought this movie was very funny--funnier than the first.  Will Smith, as Jay, completely outdoes himself here, and Tommy Lee Jones contributes to the humor as the cranky, by-the-book Kay.  Of course, there is not a whole lot to the plot--what did you expect?--but the movie nonetheless remains very entertaining.<br />MIIB is definitely worth the viewing, though I'd recommend you watch it before you buy it.  You may not want to watch this one over and over, but it would be well worth your time to see it at least once.
B000002UAF|5.0|The chiming chord that kicks off The Beatles' &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; shoots the listener right back to 1964 Beatlemania.  Just imagine the black and white images from Richard Lester's film of the same name and picture the Beatles running for their lives.<br />Beatlemania aside, this is a great power pop album.  The songwriting, musicianship and singing were all improving, and John Lennon steps into the leading man role.  Most of the lyrics are still puppy-love, but the melodies and middle-eight changes, along with the harmonies and execution, make these songs come alive.<br />&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; features a great dual lead vocal with John taking the initial and Paul taking over during the &quot;when I'm home...&quot;  Great guitar work by George as well.  I love the arpeggio fade.<br />&quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; is another love song, a happy tune with harmonica, double-tracked Lennon vocal and strummy guitars.  &quot;I never realized what a kiss could be...&quot;  Great melody in the lead and middle-eight.<br />&quot;If I Fell&quot; is a Lennon ballad that could have been sappy, and comes across as dated in 2002, but that three-part harmony works so well.<br />&quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance With You&quot; is an L/M song sung by George Harrison, with some nice guitar work but otherwise throwaway lyrics.  Still, they make it work with a catchy melody and nice hook &quot;just to dance with, oh-oh&quot; and great backing vocals by John and Paul.<br />&quot;And I Love Her&quot; is the bookend ballad to &quot;If I Fell&quot;, this time with Paul doing the lead vocal.  There's kind of a bossa nova feel here.  &quot;She gives me everhthing, and tenderly, the kiss my lover brings, she brings to me, and I love her.&quot;  Another great middle-eight, an acoustic guitar solo, and this one is a classic.<br />&quot;Tell Me Why&quot; revs things back up with another John Lennon lead vocal and excellent harmonies, but a little rockier with some jangly guitars.<br />&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; is one of Paul's all-time great compositions, with an exuberant lead vocal and killer hook of a melody.  There's a nice bouncy bassline and Ringo gets to do some drumming.  Cool lead work with some string bending by George.  &quot;Say you don't need no diamond rings, and I'll be satisfied...&quot;<br />&quot;Any Time At All&quot; is a Lennon working song.  &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; is another Lennon tune, this time with a country twang and nice drumming by Ringo.  &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; is a gem, with its quick acoustic strum, interesting melodic and harmonic structure, and marks a growing maturity to Paul's songwriting.  &quot;When I Get Home&quot; falls into the Lennon worksong realm.  &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; is a Lennon tune that has some cool Rickenbacker chimey guitars, nice chorus, and I like the stop-start of the &quot;I told you before, you can't do that.&quot;<br />&quot;I'll be Back&quot; ends the album with another strummy tune by John, with good harmonies.<br />The first seven tunes were on the soundtrack to the film, while the remaining six were added as fill.  This was the first Beatle record to feature all tunes penned by Lennon McCartney, and even the weaker songs are still sing-along worthy and enjoyable, if not always memorable.  My favorite of the latter bunch remains &quot;Things We Said Today.&quot;  Repeated listenings reveal depths not apparent on the first spin.

B000002BQK|5.0|This is definately one of my all time favorite CD's.  This CD flows like no other I have heard in years. Five years after it was released it is still a favorite.  It has timeless songs both ballards and more up tempo songs.  Really soothing to relax to or get your party on too!
B00000IBRI|4.0|I am just getting into Argento but i think what you need to do to enjoy his films is forget about the acting, and watch the way he works the camera and sells suspense. from the moment you turn the movie on you start to feel like this is going to be really good.<br />The way he uses the Swiss Countryside and Goblins score, make this movie pretty creepy.  Jen Connelly has this cosmic link with inscects and all these murders are going on, and the flies are telling her whats up. or something like that. Look the story's not the point. Watch the movie and you will be shocked at the murders, the motives, and the monkey?  I enjoyed this film. I am usually not freaked out by horror films but this on will do it.
6305180261|5.0|this is the best home video from GnR, it has all of thier music videos from AFD to Spaghetti Incident, there is NO backstage footage, NO interviews, and oddly it doesn't have the video for \\" You Could Be Mine\\". but if you are a harcore GnR fan, i truely recommened this.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|This is a great Christmas album with touches of pop, R&amp;B, jazz, and even gospel.  Christina's voice is, of course, wonderful.  The original songs (Christmas Time, This Year, These are the Special Times--Celine Dion had it on her Christmas album) sound even better than the traditional songs on the album do!  My favorites are &quot;This Year,&quot; &quot;Christmas Time,&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix).&quot;  All Christina fans should most definitely have this album; it's essential to your collection.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter on DVD brings the excitement home. It makes the perfect gift for children and adults alike. Harry Potter is intelligent reading and viewing, guaranteed to keep the children enthralled for hours and he's a good role model, not like the slaughterhouse-style anime which is popular these days.<br />The DVD provides lots of extras and combined with reading the books with it, it comes across well. There's enough action and story to keep the adults interested as well. Once you think the story is told, another twist comes up. Excellent movie (and by the way, The Chamber of Secrets -in Theaters now- was/is just as good.)<br />Combined with the books, the tale turns out beautifully on and off screen.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)

B000075BFK|5.0|Great, great, great 2Pac album. It is unbelievable that there has been more 2Pac albums released after he passed away, then when he was alive. &quot;Better Dayz&quot; is not like the Notorious B.I.G.'s latest album, in which guest artists fill the album due to a lack of material from Biggie. With Tupac Shakur, that problem does not exists! He wrote so many songs that there is another double album to be released after this one. WOW! Great production. Songs show that Tupac had so much more to contribute to the world, before his life was cut short. Every artist who participated on this album shows love for Tupac and his mother Afeni Shakur. Former East coast rival Nas shows much love with the acoustic remix &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot;. STOP THE VIOLENCE!
157492589X|5.0|I've seen LONESOME DOVE so many times I've practically got the six hours of dialogue memorized.  Yet I'll keep watching this excellent adaptation of Larry McMurtry's epic novel, over and over again.  Why?  Two words:  compelling story.<br />The friendship of Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call is the underlying theme of LONESOME DOVE; it's the motor that drives the story.  When these two weathered former lawmen steal a herd of cattle from Mexico and set off for Montana for one last grand adventure (\\"I wanna see that country,\\" says Call to Gus, \\"before the lawyers and bankers get it.\\"), the stage is set for a Western with plenty of humor, action, violence...tragedy.<br />This production makes McMurtry's unforgettable characters literally leap off the page.  Robert Duvall IS Gus McCrae...Tommy Lee Jones IS Woodrow Call.  Both performances are so vivid and on target the viewer is transported seamlessly to McMurtry's story, a story centering around the undying loyalty and friendship of these two men.<br />LONESOME DOVE is a film that will entertain you, take you over the full gambit of human emotions, then after six hours leave you begging for more.  Jones and Duvall lead a stellar cast in a remarkable film that has but one weakness:  it has to end.  And McMurtry's story is told--told so well that no other Western even comes close.
B00005QVJ2|5.0|I found this CD at a local store and with loving the movie could not wait to listen to it.  It was just like being at the movies.,  What great music!  We will play this CD every Halloween :)  I can listen to the opening scene all day long.  and Hedwig's theme is terrific.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Greatest Hits packages to me have never been a testament to the artists best work. If you're looking for a little slip away with Elton John, this collection provides everything you're looking for.<br />As I said, for the price and quality of the music, it's good, although not meaty.
6304297912|5.0|A fantastic movie. A moving, funny, horrible, sad, weird picture.<br />Drugs, this is a movie about drugs and thugs. Heroin is the main focus. Heroin and how it destroys junkies. Slowly. Painfully.  It ain't pretty. It's also about Renton, who is just smart/lucky enough and good or is it bad enough to kick the habit and get himself away to freedom, or is it another addiction, this time to middle-class materialism? I don't know. There's a lot going on.<br />It's the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cringe and grip your seat. You might even have to turn away at times. For God's sake don't watch it with a first date or your parents! There's poop and puking and the \\"f word\\" is rampant. There's violence and death and disease.<br />Sidenote: There are two Hamish MacBeth cast members in this movie, a shockingly great performance by Robert Carlyle, who plays Hamish MacBeth. (You may also remeber him from the Full Monty) You might be able to catch it on BBC America. Spud's girlfriend in the movie up played Hamish MacBeth's girlfriend in the series.
B0000024Q8|2.0|So...it seems that this record, along with Henry Cow's \\"Western Culture\\", sparks a lot of controversy among the crowd at amazon. But unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I am actually going to DESCRIBE the music insted of argue about it.<br />From the beginning you can tell that this recording has suffered from the ravages of age (either that or they're using a very cheap piano). That's really too bad, because this might have been a very good performance, were we only able to hear it better.<br />\\"In C\\" is a very hard piece to play, both mentally and physically. The subtle, ever-shifting patterns demand that you not \\"listen\\", to the music, but just play it in the background, \\"tuning in\\" from time to time. But I have a problem with Riley's instrumentation: he always uses way too many woodwinds and mallet percussion, making the piece sound like an indonesian gamelan orchestra. If you like the gamelan sound, then you won't have any problem with that, but if you find it somewhat annoying, then watch out.<br />Instead of this album, I would recommend the superb version recently released by Bang on a Can. They eliminate the gamelan effect and almost all of the wind instruments, using mostly strings such as Double Bass, Mandolin, and Electric Guitar. <br />Listen for Jon Hassel playing trumpet on this release (with the mouthpiece on, I presume), sixteen years before his collaboration with Eno on \\"Fourth World Possible Musics\\". Hmmm. Interesting.
B0000073OU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, The Selector rocks but this cd can get REALLY reduntant. Most of the songs sound the same. But it's a good cd to pick up if you want to get to know what they are like. So check them out.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|I had not read &quot;Emma&quot; before seeing this movie, which is an omission I do not generally make with regard to &quot;novels-turned-movies&quot;.  However, from the very first scene, I fell so in love with the characters, the beauty of the scenery, and the very witty dialogue, that I could not wait to read the book.  I beg the forgiveness of staunch Jane Austen fans as I must confess my mild disappointment in the book. Not that the book is not a masterpiece itself.  It truly is.  However, this movie was so well done, that my opinion of it is even higher than of the book.  I do not mean to detract in any way from the book.  But I so appreciate the attention to detail in the dress, mannerisms, and sets that make this Regency England!  Of course, Austen needn't have troubled herself with descriptions of this kind as she was writing for those who knew very well the circumstances of the various characters.  But for those of us to whom such society is quite foreign, the visual effects of the movie are quite compelling!  I also found the use of music in this movie to be particularly appropriate to the various scenes, particularly the music surrounding the scene in which Emma is leading Harriet to think less of Mr. Martin &amp; more of Mr. Elton.  Truly, a job well done!
B000070WJE|5.0|Guess who's back? With a brand spanking, guitar stuming, head banging &quot;can't get you out of my head&quot; album. At first listen fans may be disappointed to discover there are no &quot;Rock DJ's&quot; or &quot;Supreme's&quot; but give it time and you soon catch on to his wit and self derogatory jokes. The big cheeses can sigh with reflief, monsters like &quot;Monsoon&quot; and &quot;Handsome Man&quot; are gonna give them their money's worth. Oh and look out for the 2nd secret track at the end - a sly dig at fellow celebs with catchy lyrics. Well done Rob - you've done it again see you next August!
B00006RU5B|5.0|All the negative reviews I am reading regarding this album seem to have something to do with not liking lead singer Chris Cornell's 'horrible' rock voice.  I went into this merger as both a huge Soundgarden fan as well as a huge Rage fan, I have all the albums of both bands - and this union is just fine with me, in fact it's more than I expected.  I personally like all 14 tracks and hold no bias while listening.  I love Chris Cornell's voice and I love Tom Morello's guitar playing and to hear them at the same time sends chills down the old spine.  If people are mad at Morello or the remaining Rage members for going a little softer on this album then you aren't doing enough research on your own band - they broke up in part because de la Rocha and his band members were no longer seeing eye to eye.  If you were expecting this album to continue the Rage then maybe you're disappointed but you shouldn't be surprised - when de la Rocha left he took his rage with him - Cornell fills the gap wonderfully and I don't care what anyone says this album rocks!

0385470819|4.0|In John Grisham's first novel, A TIME TO KILL, he did a wonderful job of giving the reader a vivid mental picture while at the same time pulling you into the story and giving every reader an emotional attachment to Carl Lee Hailey and his ten year old daughter, Tanya.  After his daughter was brutally raped and beaten by two redneck hillbillies, Carl Lee Hailey was so deeply affected by the violation of his daughter that he took matters into his own hands and killed both of the rapists in the courthouse after their hearing.<BR>One of Mississippi's finest defense lawyers, Jake Brigance, takes on nearly impossible odds.  He agrees to defend a black man who killed two white men and injured a white police officer.  Brigance has to defend Hailey to an all white jury also.  On top of the struggle for what is morally right, Brigance and Hailey are often visited by the Ku Klux Klan, which also adds to the community disturbance.<BR>Throughout the course of this novel I was troubled by the extent of hatred one human could have for another simply based on the color of skin.  I am deeply troubled by some of the actions and moral conflicts that take place in Grisham's novel A TIME TO KILL due to my high moral standards.  However, that edge that he so carefully smudges across each page keeps your hands tightly grasped to the book page after page.

B000002U9W|5.0|This was the first Pink Floyd album I was introduced to.  At first, I was only able to enjoy Atom Heart Mother, but eventually, I grew to enjoy all of the other songs as well.<br />To be honest, I wouldn't suggest it being the first album by Floyd you get; try Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall.

My first thought was how can this type of music make <BR>it to CD with the way the music business is run today. I <BR>agree with some of the comparisons, The Verve, Pink Floyd, <BR>and even some early U2. This music takes you places.<br />&quot;Clocks&quot; is a favorite, an immediate tune. There's an <BR>expression, &quot;always coming but never arriving&quot;, this tune arrives. <br />I like every song. There are probably 5 singles (I wish) here. <BR>&quot;In my place&quot;, &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;,<BR>and &quot;Daylight&quot; have received 7-8 listens on the drive home the past few days. <br />Great band! I'll have to pick up their first one.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is absolutely amazing. Great music especially \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away with Me\\". I got the CD after reading the previous reviews and was highly satisfied. A MUST for ANYONE!!
B0000640VO|5.0|I started dragging my friend to see more indie and foreign films after spending a ton of money to see a rash of [bad] american films.  Someone tipped me off to Amelie and we went to see it.  Bravo for foreign films-- they're like a breath of fresh air!  Amelie is no exception.  She is endearing, sweet, innocent, and fun.  Her good deeds are charming and pure.  Yet you see a note of mischeviousness in her eyes.  You wonder if she's actually going to ever get together with the guy (you know she will, but you still wonder).  I walked out laughing and smiling and loving foreign films all over again.
B00007E8V4|3.0|Hopefully you understand that this album is all the songs that were cut off of their Toxicity album and don't expect anything really new or unique. It's the same old sound of Toxicity, and it's a great album for big fans of SoaD but I'd first by SoaD's self-titled and Toxicity before I wasted my time on this. It's got the same feel of Toxicity but less melodic, I guess it could be seen as louder and more in-your-face than some of the material on Toxicity, but Toxicity was a great album nevertheless and in comparison this falls short. That's all you need to know. As the album's title so daringly states, \\"Steal This Album\\", don't actually buy it--it's nothing new, and if you actually listened to the lyrics of some of the political songs you would understand that you are doing them a favor.<br />Best songs are Streamline and innervision.
0066214122|3.0|This book explores almost the exact same themes as Jurassic Park ... only not quite as masterfully. It has the same flow as the preceding book, Timeline: start with a hip premise, insert a some technical background, have the protaganists interact with the technology, but instead of expanding upon these themes, the books final 100 pages or so morph into a half-hearted adventure yarn.<br />I really wanted to like this book as it is ostensibly based on an area of interest to me: NEMS (nanotechnology). Actually the book covers a lot of themes: male/ female role reversal a la Disclosure, innate unpredictability of complex systems - Jurassic Park, bleeding edge technology with which scientists take shortcuts - JP and Timeline, as well as corporate conspiracy and coverups - basically all of MC's books. However the book spends most of its energy on evolution, emergent behavior, and AI. This really is not a book about nano. <br />All of this being said, the book is interesting and a page turner. I read it in one sitting. The problems of the book are most noticeable when compared with some of Crichton's best work like Jurassic Park or Sphere. Prey does not really explore the human element as it relates to the technologies on which the story is built. This is actually odd because it seems as though MC spends a good deal of the book providing a lot of background for both the protaganist and the technologies. Unfortunately, he drops them cold when in the the end, the book devolves quickly into a B movie horror replete with big explosions, chases, fights, more explosions, and an abrupt one page summary of all that has just transpired. Bummer.<br />In summary: an enjoyable enough read, that has a lot of potential but hastily squanders it in the end and for that reason falls way short of of MC's best books. If you have not yet done so, pick up Jurassic Park or a Case of Need instead.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of those movies that you'll love or hate-- i haven't heard anyone say it was &quot;so-so&quot;.  I'm in the love category-- and not just because I love Ewan McGregor, although he helped.  This movie blew me away.  I felt like I was on a roller coaster for the first 15 minutes-- it was a frenzy of color, movement, song.  I enjoyed the story and characters.  In this age of &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; movies, Moulin Rouge was a stand-out original.<br />Perhaps what affected me the most, however, was the singing.  As a professional singer, I have a huge amount of admiration for people who can stand up and sing out when it's not necessarily their profession.  It's so rare that actors cross over and do their own singing and it would have been pretty easy for them to have Ewan and Nicole lip sync while a professional sang the actual songs.  But having them actually sing made the movie what it is.  I can't even imagine the amount of work that went into just learning the songs and practicing them until they were movie-worthy.  <br />Plus, it was like Ewan was singing just to me.  Mmmm...<br />My friend just called to say that she rented this movie for us to watch tonight.  I can't wait!  So, despite what you may have heard, you should give the movie a chance.  It might just surprise you.
B000002C1V|5.0|I understand why many people don't consider this a Pink Floyd album. It probably is Water's first solo album, but it is a brilliant, beautiful, disturbing album. The lyrics alone make this one a great purchase. One of my favorites occur in \\"The Hero's Return\\"<br />\\"Sweetheart, Sweetheart are you fast asleep?<br />Good.<br />That's the only time when i can really speak to you...There is something that I've locked away...a memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day...\\"<br />To me, that is one of the most honest lyrics in music. Because anyone in a relationship has had this conversation with a sleeping companion. Revealing something in secret because it causes too much pain to reveal publicly. That song leads into the gorgegous \\"The Gunner's Dream\\".<br />As stated in some of the other reviews, one of the greatest treats on the album is the sound effects and background images. Some are haunting, some hilarious, some frightening. But \\"The Final Cut\\" is a recording that is best listened to with headphones. <br />One of my favorite songs in the whole Floyd catalog is the title track. \\"The Final Cut\\" it's a song that talks about revealing yourself, the deepest, darkest places of your soul to someone. It's also highlighted by Gilmour's gorgeous guitar work.<br />The albums title is also revealing because it is the final Floyd album. Waters went on to his solo career, the rest of Floyd formed the abysmally weak Pink Floyd-lite. I wish that Waters and the rest of Floyd would bury the hatchet and reform. They were a stunning act in the 70's. The second concert I ever attended was when they performed \\"The Wall\\" in Los Angeles. It was an amazing performance. <br />Considering some of the [stuff] that passes for music now, we desperately need Floyd to reform. Regardless, \\"The Final Cut\\" is a brilliant album and reminds me of the power that Floyd created. It's also one of my favorite Floyd albums and stands shoulder to shoulder with The Wall, Dark Side, Wish You WereHere, and Animals. It's an overlooked masterpiece.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton is finally back in his prime, covering what he does best: fact- and science-based fiction. This time around, he's got the good sense to not let the book degenerate into a direct-to-video scripted action sequence halfway through the book (read Timeline if that's what you're looking for). Having read all of Crichton's books (including Travels), I can say that Prey is one of the better ones, combining the how-cool-is-that aspect of technology (Jurassic Park) with the confusion and paranoia of being attacked by a force that's not well understood (Sphere). What puts the icing on the cake is that Crichton has again written a great character that's fleshed out a lot more than his usual protagonists. Long-time readers might even be distraught at the amount of character development that exist within Prey. All in all, a satisfying read, although not the most intellectually challenging.
0553208845|5.0|Hello.  My name is Rebecca and I am 13 years old.  I go to a school where we are challenged to read beyond our regular level.  This school goes from preschool through 9th grade.  When I first entered 6th grade here, the required portion of the summer reading list contained: The Essential Haiku and Siddhartha.  As an 11 year old, I wasn't thrilled.  However, now that I've read it, I've realized so much, and changed so much, about my natural way of life.  Everything seemed so simple!  As an average American kid, I always have 'places to go and people to see'.  After I read Siddhartha, I tried to slow down.  Rushing just wasn't a good way to live your life.<br />Thank you, Herman Hesse, for a way to let a young kid know what's important.

0316776963|5.0|This is one of the few books I've read that actually had me laughing out loud.  His trouble with the gender of french words is classic, anyone who has learned a new language will relate.  Not surprisingly my favorite chapter is about his brother, The Rooster.  A North Carolina bred man who clings on to his Gangsta Rap roots with every word he utters...sheer brilliance.  Rivaling in hilarity is his tour of Paris listening to an Audio book translating french medical terms.  A fine way to unassumingly listen to a walkman for some, a great way to crack me up on the subway.

0385474547|4.0|Hello.  My name is Rebecca and I am 13 years old.  I am an avid reader- it is my favorite thing to do!  I like to read review of books I enjoy, so I read the one on Things Fall Apart.  I am humiliated by the lack of good reviews from young people!  I am absolutely horrified!  As a classmate of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in my school that have read it (and loved it, mind you!)that I cannot believe it.  One common thing I noticed was the lack of understanding with the bad review.  At my school we always have to do extensive research on a book before we read it; that way we will know what to expect.  I would suggest you do that for all the books you read; it may help you decide what you are prepared for.
0800135954|5.0|This is a very good movie,in my opinion.It tells the story of a man's incredible journey through life and love.I think I like it so much becuase the outcome of this movie is like no other that I've ever seen.It throws things at you that you wouldn't normally expect.It is traget but well worth watching.Well,I can't say anything more other than watch this movie! you won't regret it!:)
B0000696I0|2.0|TMNT II wouldn't have been that bad but compared to the first, it's a big joke because the first one, it was a serious, dark and true Martial Arts film and in TMNT II, it became a cheap slapstick comedy and don't even get me started on Ninja Rap. In my opinion, as far as the Turtles phenomenon goes, this is where the Turtles \\"jumped the shark\\". Seriously, that was enough for me after that because it was impossible to respect them after they went that cheap. <br />I won't deny it, this is a great movie for kids. A lot of action, dumb jokes and wise cracks, and in general, a lot of silliness. But for those of us older fans of the TMNT series, you might not be as impressed.

B00003CXCW|5.0|William Holden and Billy Wilder in their prime, Gloria Swanson in a career revival, Eric Von Stroheim as the butler--what more could a film fanatic ask?  Nothing, for this film is a gift from the Gods.  If you have never seen this film, you will realize how much garbage you are seeing film-wise nowadays after seeing it for the first time.  Better yet, this bears up to repeat viewings.  I've seen it at least 4 or 5 times and it is always superb.<br /><br />Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) gets caught in the web of former screen diva Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Not only is she desirous of a lover but she also wants a writer to revive her screen legend. Problem is that she's gone a bit mad between her hey-day of the silents and 1950s Hollywood. Swanson's finest moment is her long descent down her mansion's staircase where she is finally again able to perform for the lights and the cameras but in a way she can't comprehend.  Her use of her hands and face in this extraordinary descent show her as the luminary talent she remained into her late middle age. She also utters her long quoted line of being ready for her close-up.  All in all a flat out classic and likely to remain so.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000005H40|5.0|I bought this album in Mumbai, India way back in 1984. I had then not heard much about Coltrane. I was and still not into any form of western music. But I like Indian classical Music. And Coltrane moved me beyond my wildest imagination. Even today when I hear &quot;I'm old fashioned&quot;, tears come to my eyes. For me,he is Pandit Coltrane!
B00006LSM3|5.0|In some sense, although Harrison's passing has been almost unbearable for his fans, it is fitting and somewhat soothing that he went out on as fine an album as \\"Brainwashed\\". Although some reviewers here have said that it sounds like later efforts such as \\"Cloud Nine\\" and The Travelling Wilburys, it sounds to me more like a return to the spirit and feel of his 70s work.  Remarkably, Jeff Lynne does not overproduce the thing--with Dhani's supervision, he has managed to strike the right balance between the \\"rough demo\\" feel George wanted and just enough <BR>studio polish (when needed) to flesh out each track's potential.<BR>But more than anything else, \\"Brainwashed\\" is literally the most consistent collection of songs in the man's catalogue since \\"All Things Must Pass\\".<br />The album opens with the catchy, upbeat \\"Any Road\\", which sounds warm, welcoming and light on its feet, then moves into the hilarious \\"Vatican Blues\\", which proves that Harrison's biting sense of humor only improved with age.  \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" are lushly melodic tunes with a full production,<BR>although this is neither the Spectorian orchestral wall-of-sound of \\"All Things Must Pass\\" nor the late 80s ELO-ish \\"Cloud Nine\\"; rather, these tracks miraculously manage to sound humble and sweeping at the same time.  The charming \\"The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea\\" is exactly the way Harrison wanted it, a novelty number that somehow becomes the heart of the album.  The closing title track will make one weep all over again at the loss of a legendary spirit; the savage commentary of the lyric which is resolved by the Hare Krishna chant seems to encapsulate the message of his life, and this time around--with the loving help of son Dhani--the religious influence sounds not preachy or indulgent but vital, personal and heartfelt.  What many feel to be the album's greatest moment, however, is provided by the <BR>soaring instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", in which Harrison's slide<BR>takes the listener on a journey to the heavens and beyond.  What with such a magical command of healing musical forces, it is no wonder he was not afraid of death.  <br />The rest of the tracks are slightly less transcendental but always listenable, with a consistenly warm and gentle spirit throughout.  Even the social comment is relatively upbeat; perhaps sensing the dour, nihilistic nature of the last few decades, Harrison's deliberate attempt to recapture a pure sense of positive humanity is a welcome antidote which fits with his continuing (and still overwhelming) influence as a Beatle.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is an excellent album regardless of any special circumstances; however, when considered as posthumous final statement, it becomes that much more a moment for pause and philosophical reflection.  George, you helped to change and enlighten the world, and I hope you are at peace, wherever you are.
0446608955|5.0|I had seen the movie, but the book is by far better!  It is a test of character, and as a teenager it gives me some hope that there are true love stories in this world.  When you have given up on love, read this book, it will show you that love does exist, especially when you aren't looking. :o)
B00006LPER|1.0|No matter how edgy or avant garde you might think you are, you may find this movie disturbingly creepy. I personally wish I had not seen it, as it gave me nightmares. The central character is a repressed musician who never made the big time. Her pushy stage mother resents that both their lives were utterly wasted in the pursuit of stardom that did not happen, and she takes all her rage and disappointment out on the hapless daughter who is now an aging old maid herself. They made a lot of sacrifices, and now they live together, miserable, lonely, sex-starved, and barely making it on the daughter's paycheck as a piano teacher. All the sexual repression is really quite nauseating, and the daughter expresses her angst by physically cutting herself, watching porno movies with perverted men and doing filthy things in sex shops. Ultimately, she gets involved in a truly gnarly relationship with a young, handsome student who has no clue how to handle the truly deep-seated and deranged perversions of this older woman. The end totally grossed me out, and I am really suprised an actress of the stature of Isabelle Hupert could rationalize this work as \\"art\\".
B00005AAFS|5.0|Although most of the words are not understandable, the energy and power Rammstein has in his words are too great to be overcame  by language differences.  I think that the German langueg is much more powerful and more commanding than English.  And yes i am fromt he US, and have been here my whole life.  The music in the backround goes great with Rammstein's voice and I think it's one of the greatest singer that i have heard of.  I like heavy metal, my most favorite is Korn and Sytem of a Down.  I like these groups because it's upbeat and makes me think that I can do anything I want and it makes me feel invulnerable to anything.  I love Rammstein!!!
0385335482|5.0|This is a good book. Easy read. Funny.
B00000I1OY|2.0|Ah, the Sixties... America's longtime history of art intertwining with psychedelia starts here. Listening to the musical artists of the time -- Laura Nyro, Joe Cocker, old Heart records -- one wonders if the rampant search for inner meaning in an increasingly meaningless society ever made it's way to the silver screen. Well, wonder no more, gentle movieviewer! The Swimmer is proof positive that directors, too, were coked to the gills. Set amidst a disgustingly suburban upper-middle class vista, Burt Lancaster (a man who's entire physique immediately brings the name \\"Stretch Armstrong\\" to mind) decides to mark his return home by 'swimming' across town. No, it's not Venice; he accomplishes his task by taking a dip in every pool in the borough. Along the way, we discover that Lancaster has shafted pretty much everyone in the film, literally or otherwise, and the cinematography takes decidedly bizarre turns during his descent from jet-setting, womanizing capitalist to pathetic, obsessive-compulsive freak. The dialogue is downright absurd at times -- \\"What happened to the sun? There's no more warmth in it!\\" -- and the cameramen seem to be completely stoned, especially during Janet Langard's soliloquey about her childhood crush on Lancaster, spoken from behind Lancaster's head, behind foliage. As the strichnine poisoning slowly begins to take this acidtrip film down horrible paths, we're not surprised, or even moved, when a thoroughly defeated Lancaster receives what he sorely deserves: a swift boot in the rear.
0060523794|4.0|Not only can Lou Gerstner run a business, he also writes a credible, well-crafted account of what he did.  Despite many ex-IBM reviewers who despise him and a certain amount of ego that has to show through in a book like this, it feels like Lou had the analytic skills, strategic vision and ability to execute that made him the right guy at the right time for a very tough job.<br />That said, he lost some credibility with me in his chapter on &quot;The System&quot;.  Lou shows his distaste for government regulation then proposes an income tax revision that would tax away short term profits, a classic example of suggesting the system be micro managed with narrowly based regulation at a time when simplification and true reform are vital.  And in case you didn't pick up his contempt for investment bankers earlier, this is the chapter where he really lets them have it.  Ironically just after the book came out he signed on as the part-time Chairman of the Carlyle Group.<br />Which leads to the strongest impression the book left on me: Lou's true success will be measured by history that still has to be written.  Mr. Gerstner will now sit on top of a company that lives off of a military-industrial behemoth that's bigger than ever forty plus years after Ike warned us of it. If he can do big things to make that system work for the greater good, he'll be a hero of the 21st Century.  If, however, he is just renting out his Rolodex, &quot;Elephants&quot; could turn out to be another on the long list entitled, &quot;buy the book, short the author.&quot;
B00003CXSP|1.0|This movie lacks everything that Silence of the Lambs had.  Even with the acting talents of Hopkins or Julianne Moore, this movie is completely ham fisted.  Not sure if the blame goes to the director ( although I have liked most of Ridley Scott's work) or the screenwriter but this movie is just obscene.  A brutal simplistic sequel to a subtle original.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Sensational album. Cornell sounds fantastic with the Ex-Rage trio supporting him. If you are a fan of great rock music then this album will not disappoint! If you are looking for hip-hop on the your rock album, go buy Eminem.<br />Good riddance to the all to self-important Zach and his ever growing ego.
630521610X|5.0|Scream (1996) is great, it is so entertaining. It is a little cheesy 6 years later but i still rememer how much it scared me the first time i saw it when i was 9. Scream 2 and 3 also were creepy but part 1 was the best. I have the 'widescreen series' DVD, it has a commentary track, a theatrical trailer and movie recommendations. The movie kicks off with Drew Barrymore (cUtE as hell), is getting harassed by a crazy prank caller obviously in her back yard. Helpless Casey? No! If she would have not stopped so many times to see her parent's coming she could have made it to their car. Sidney plays the quiet, incredibly annoying protagonist who someone is desperately trying to kill, the killer even tries to kill her in the restroom! Anyway, no turn is safe and anyone can be the killer! Scream is probably the best scary movie of the nineties through 2002. See it, it will definately at least entertain you if you like mystery and thrillers and if you like those teen high school slashers. Scream isn't made for people like Rogert Ebert, so don't expect it to get a grammy, although it did get an MTV award. Scream is a great cut and every Tolerable DVD collection of hit movies should include it.
B00005JKED|3.0|Very good movie, chilling psychopath detective, Denzel Washington shepherds Ethan Hawke through a &quot;typical&quot; training day in LA, on the young officer's first day in a top narcotics squad.<br />Last 25 min damage the movie quite a bit, lost opportinity for the director to make a real LA epic. worth a watch though!  I was hoping for the promised showdown in Macarthur park.  What the movie degenerated into was worthy of early 80's network junk.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I would NEVER, EVER buy a Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera (first cd).  I'm sick of people who can't sing being annoitated as the second coming or people who can sing being boxed into the pop package.  Nothing wrong with Pop but it doesn't really allow you to use what G-d gave you.<br />I knew Christina Aguilera had an amazing voice and I'm so proud she's finally using it and proving she is here for the long haul.  Yeah \\"Dirty\\" is just that and I like it that way, I bought \\"Stripped\\" and listened to the entire thing and loved every song.  For those of you not apart of the music industry or don't have a connection to it don't understand this is the real Christina.  That Mickey Mouse [club] was what she had to do to get in the door, her in the studio with Alicia Keyes and singing ...is herself.  She's been through a lot including watching a non-singing female fake her way to the top of the charts.<br />Christina is the real deal and Mrs. Spears is our generations version of Madonna.  Madonna is a great promoter of herself and her music but is not a true singer ala Britney Spears.  Christina can hold her own with the heavy weights of music and her writing talents are coming along beautifully.<br />For all the non-believers stick to your Pop diet only fans of true singers and future legends need to buy \\"Stripped\\".
B00006M183|5.0|I call this album my \\"saviour\\" because it virtually saved me during my last year of high school.  This is a creative album, it features many different opinions and views on the album.  The politically driven anthem 'Bushleaguer' is an attack on the President of the United States and Pearl Jam pulls it off like pure geniuses.  Musically, this is one of my favourites of Pearl Jam.  I want to personally thank Matt Cameron for providing the intelligence behind 'Cropduster' and 'You Are' which are possibly the two best tracks on the album, in my opinion. <br />This features classic hard rock Pearl Jam - 'Save You', 'Ghost', 'Green Disease' and the humble Pearl Jam - 'Thumbing My Way' and 'All or None'.  Most people put down the second last track, 'Arc', but I think it's somewhat spirtually driven and musically inspiring. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, folks, this album doesn't have one bad track.  It's brilliance like all of their albums.  If you're a Pearl Jam fan - you already have this album - if you're just browsing music, I highly recommend this album.  If you've lost faith in Pearl Jam - for some [strange] reason - this will bring you back.  Trust me.
B000002L42|3.0|In 1994, before I had a CD player of my own, a bootleg live CD of Steely Dan's then current tour showed up at the local music store, which i listened to at the store. The opening number was a very cool jazz influenced intstrumental medley of some of the Dan's jazzier tunes. It was absolutely incredible! The rest of the CD, although lacking in top notch recording quality, nevertheless  was filled with creativity and energy. I was very excited when I heard that this live CD was being released by the group, and I've never been so disappointed in my life! Compared to what I heard, this sounds lethargic and tired. I don't know who chose the tapes to release for this album, but they definitely chose the wrong ones.
0395389496|5.0|Oh, what a beautiful book this is!  I've owned this book for over fifteen years, and every year during the holiday season I take it down from the shelf and read it, and I am immediately taken back into time.  For the few minutes that it takes me to read this book I once again become a child full of wonder and innocence.  I begin to believe in the magic of the holiday season, and yes, for a moment I even believe in Santa Claus again.<br />This is the story of a boy lucky enough to ride The Polar Express to the North Pole on one magical night to see Santa Claus and his elves.  While the destination is exciting, the real fun is riding in this train full of children, all dressed in their pajamas and snacking on cookies and milk.  The story is beautifully told by Chris Van Allsburg, but the real reason why reading this book is an annual tradition for me is the brilliance of the illustrations.  The pictures are painstakingly detailed, especially the beautiful images of the train, the light from the stars in the sky, and the fallen snow.<br />While Santa Claus is incorporated into the story and the illustrations, he is not the focal point.  The crux of this book centers around this train, the wintery environment, and the youthful magic that makes it all so special.<br />I am now 22-years-old, and this book is just as compelling for me today as it was when I was 5.  I look forward to the day when I will have children of my own and will be able to make it an annual tradition to read this book to them.  This book is a must-have for anyone's personal library, especially if you are a parent, a child, or a child-at-heart like me.  I give this book the highest of recommendations.
B00006RU5B|5.0|No one was sure Rage Meets Soundgarden would work. Not even the band was sure at first. Then after producer Rick Rubin set ex-Soundergarden vocalist, Chris Cornell with ex-Rage Against The Machine musicians Tim Cummerford, Brad Wilk, and Tom Morello, and a 19 day songwriting period that produced 21 songs this Rock Mega-Merger was set. Now Audioslave releases its debut album, a 14 song mastered rock anthem packed with more energy than you can throw a stick at. Cornell's voice shines as good as it's ever been, as emphasized in the track \\"Exploder.\\" Morello's erie futuristic guitar sounds provide the Rage taste to Audioslave, giving them a unique and ambitous sound. Listening to some of Morello's solos is like listening to a Radiohead album. The headlining track \\"Cochise\\" is Audioslave's calling card. It defines their sound with a guitar riff, that'll take pry bars to get out of your head. But being the great single that it is, it's not nearly the best song on the album. The album really highlights with tracks like \\"Set It Off\\" \\"Light My Way\\" \\"I Am A Highway\\" and \\"Show Me How To Live.\\" Cornell shows off his lyrical ingenuity in Audioslave. In the song \\"Like A Stone\\" he sings \\"I'll wait for you there, like a stone, i'll wait for you there, alone.\\" Seemingly he's singing about a waiting love when he's really singing about waiting to die, knowing he's on his own. So do Chris Cornell and Rage work? Saying yes wouldn't do them justice. Together they may have created the best album of the year. 9.5/10 Highlights: \\"I Am The Highway\\" \\"Show Me How To Live\\" \\"Exploder\\" \\"Like A Stone\\" \\"Cochise\\" \\"Light My Way\\"
0380977273|3.0|The book 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is a book about two young boys trying to find adventure, only to realize the adventure coming to them is not what they were out looking for.  I think that this book teaches a valuable lesson and when looking for adventure make sure you look up the road a little futher.
0316666343|5.0|This is a great book, easy reading.  I have enjoyed reading it thus far!
B00005YW4H|5.0|So the first track, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, is all over the radio now.  I even noticed it in the background of a &quot;Smallville&quot; episode.  That song is why I bought the album and, thankfully, I love the rest it too!  I was surprised to hear her jazz voice on a pop station.  If pop music is your thing, be careful, there's a soft country element to some of these songs.
B00000IMYA|4.0|This is a remarkable, historic release--a 1999 restoration of the classic 1956 Ellington Newport album which includes Paul Gonsalves' famous 27-chorus solo on &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot;.  Yet I find it hard to disentangle the rights &amp; wrongs of this release.<br />First, the rights.  The original release of the Gonsalves solo was badly flawed because it was played off-mike.  Or so it was thought: in fact it turned out that Gonsalves had simply picked the wrong mike, which was hooked up to the Voice of America broadcast of the concert rather than the Columbia engineers' equipment.  The VOA tapes were recovered, &amp; engineer Phil Schaap has created a highly acceptable stereo mix by running the VOA recording in one channel, the Columbia recording in the other.<br />Columbia tried to get the Ellington band to secretly rerecord the entire disc in the studio.  They did so, &amp; the majority of the original LP was a studio recreation, with canned applause.  Ellington angrily balked at forcing Gonsalves to recreate his original solo, however, &amp; so the version of &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo&quot; on the LP was indeed the flawed live version.  (In addition, the LP included the live version of &quot;Jeep's Blues&quot;, &amp; spliced in Ray Nance's live solo on the &quot;Festival Suite&quot; to the studio rerecording.  The rest of the LP was the studio recording, including faked emcee banter &amp; announcements.)<br />So, this is an invaluable, almost miraculous restoration of the original 1956 Newport set; as an appendix, the studio session is included at the end.  Yet my verdict would be mixed on whether the new version &quot;improves&quot; the old album.  The verdict would be a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; for the centrepiece of the album: &quot;Diminuendo...&quot;.  But what about the rest?<br />Well, the album starts bathetically enough. Four members of the band went AWOL before the planned start time for the set, &amp; Ellington took the stage, played &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, &quot;Black &amp; Tan Fantasy&quot; &amp; &quot;Tea of Two&quot; with the partial band before giving up &amp; aborting the set.  Once the truant members had arrived, they returned to the attack with &quot;Take the 'A' Train&quot;, before moving immediately to &quot;Festival Suite&quot;.  This was new music, written with Ellington's usual haste &amp; clearly underrehearsed: the live performance is acceptable but has a lot of flubs, &amp; in general the later studio version of these tracks is my preference.  The rest of the concert is rather a ragbag--a nice &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, a rather annoying vocal number, &quot;Day In Day Out&quot;, a couple numbers for Hodges (&quot;I Got It Bad...&quot; features a rare goof from him on the opening phrase--they thus rerecorded this piece in the studio too, though it wasn't on the original 1956 LP), the throwaway novelty number &quot;Tulip or Turnip&quot;, a drum feature for Sam Woodyard called &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, &amp; the closing cooler &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;.  What the restoration of the concert largely reveals is that EXCEPT for &quot;Diminuendo &amp; Crescendo in Blue&quot; this wasn't an especially remarkable concert.  The flood of extra material, in other words, considerably dilutes the impact of the album.  &amp; also, the inclusion of every jot &amp; tittle of the announcements &amp; crowd noise &amp; whatnot from the original concert further slackens the pace--do we really need _all_ of this?  (By my count, there's about 12 minutes' worth of this &quot;atmosphere&quot; included among the live tracks.)<br />I feel rather guilty about giving this less than a 5-star rating, consideringly that this is an album with one of the greatest recorded solos in jazz.  But I rather wish that Columbia had put out, in addition to this complete edition of the event &amp; the studio sessions, a one-CD condensation that would appeal more to the casual listener.  Sometimes less_is_ more.
0783226063|1.0|This movie seems to be made more for fans of the actors and not fans of Dune. Using people such as Patrick Stewart as Hallack is just to much for me to bare. And still they create utter trash such as \\"wierding modules\\" depress me even more. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! SHUN IT! The sci-fi version is so much better.
B000002AH1|5.0|I disagree with those who claim that Miles Davis was ahead of his time. He wasn't of ANY time. He was of his own era, defying traditions, categorizations, and norms. He wasn't afraid to ruffle his artistic feathers, and he swam waters where others feared to tread. \\"Live-Evil,\\" a collection of live and studio tracks recorded in 1970 in NYC and Washington, D.C., isn't so much a jazz record as it is a fusion of rock and funk with enough verve to give even James Brown a run for his money. The liner notes proudly declare that the Miles Davis Band is the \\"hardest working band in the business,\\" and if any record provides substance to that claim, this CD is it. Unlike most of the modern day, get-rich-quick MTV stars who know nothing about paying dues or music, Miles Davis and his band demonstrate on this album that they're clearly not in it for the money. Not only do they play music, they live it, dream it, drink it, and feel it. Music consumes them, and they consume it. Listen to the 20-minute escapade of \\"What I Say\\",\\" which is a frenzied rush of funked-up guitars, booming bass, and an unforgettable drum solo (from Jack DeJohnette) that captivates you during all of its five minutes. \\"Funky Tonk\\" and the disc's opener \\"Sivad\\" also follow the same vein, as offer serious slices of edgy, soulful rock that sounds vital even after 30-odd years. I realize that this and other albums of Miles' \\"electric\\" period make up an acquired taste that may put off those who are familiar with the Miles Davis of \\"Round About Midnight.\\" But to understand Miles, as with any great legend in music, is to truly appreciate his entire body of work, which makes up a fascinating journey of musical evolution. \\"Live-Evil\\" is a work of passion that's not for the timid. It's a heart-stoppingly brilliant double disc that strangles the conventions of music until it gasps for air, begging for mercy.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I can't praise this album more, having waited months for the  Rage against the Machine, Cornell project to finally come to light with this record, I was not disapointed. Cornell outstanding again with his distinctive powerful vocal style shining through the myriad of songs again proving that he is one of, if not the best rock vocalist around, not to mention the wonderful lyrical dexterity that meanders throught the album. Tom Morello gives a brilliant performance with soaring and contemplative guitar work and it seems as if he has an automatic symbiosis with Chris as with Thyil in Soundgarden. The brilliant savage roar of Cochise and show me how to live rip open the exhilirating audio experience that this album undoubtedly is. Gasoline burns into the psyche while songs such as I am the highway, light my way and the last remaining light show the contemplative wisdom of the collective experiences of this band. All in all this is the must have album of the year. I would say that if you do not have it then save yourself and BUY IT NOW.
0375414053|2.0|I listened to friends tell me how hilarious this book was so I kept reading, hoping something interesting would happen, something at least REAL!  I'm supposed to muster up sympathy for this supposedly brilliant woman who is a shark in the world of business but at home is afraid of her nanny and her housekeeper?  It all seemed so absolutely silly and inane!  And what was so funny about the high-school highjinks this crowd of female corporate geniuses pulled on the their co-worker after he put up nude composites of a fellow female work-mate on the internet?  This was the best they could come up with??  Are you telling me you have to destroy your own career in order to get even?  You know what it reminded me of?  That movie \\"9 to 5\\" with Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda.  Without the charm.
0312243022|5.0|The Hours defines wonderful. A novel full of wonder by author Michael Cunningham, that is the fine line seperating the understanding from the knowledge that indigo and blue are in fact two different colours. If this book does not revolutionize your perception of this world and what \\"life\\" really means from one person to the next, I fear the worst. Michael's talent and ecrition are unsurpassed; he writes with egality in beauty to great authors such as Kate Chopin, and of course Virginia Woolf. Although a fictional piece of work, The Hours leaves you with intense empathy and for the characters and a hint of brilliance in one owns mind. This is truely a work for the times.
0140544518|5.0|This book is great.  I'm having trouble parting with it- originally I wanted to give it as a gift- guess I need to order another.  I used this book to jumpstart a creative writing assignment in my jr/sr high class.  My students were very attentive and curious to see just how the story unfolds.  Scieszka's wolf tells a great story about what REALLY happened with him and the 3 little hams.  It's very entertaining to the age group prescribed (around 9 yrs old,) and I would add up to adult.  (Not for the 3 yr old- my daughter was oh, so bored when I tried it out on her- she didn't get it.)
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's not Soundgarden, and it's not Rage:  it's just Audioslave.  The name may be cheesy, but the music speaks for itself.  It's a blend of thundering guitar riffs in &quot;Set It Off&quot; and &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot; that only be from Tom Morello and soul-pounding songs like &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; and &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot; that have established Cornell as the most versatile singer of the past two decades.  There are a few slow moments in the album with &quot;Like A Stone,&quot; but make no mistake, rock has finally returned to the ariways.  I really didn't care for the CD upon the first listen, but after the second, I was on board.
0066214122|4.0|Lately, I have been reading many, many - medical thillers, (which everyone of them, I figured out what the heck was going happen 30-50 pages in, but kept on reading just to see if I was right) and I have read all of Michael Crichton books - in majority of them the plot twists and aha's, kept me engaged. I will say this, I was<BR>very much involved with what was happening, I felt myself turning the pages as fast I as I could to see what would happen next, then - the situation with the Rabbit, and the &quot;foreshadowing&quot; question, of there was a reason he had to know why the rabbit had died. - I just knew what was going to happen, how it was all going to turn out, - very pat ending. I guess I wanted more, I wanted to be suprised. I don't know what I wanted to happen, just not a Hollywood Thriller ending. This book deserves more then that.  -- Why 4 stars you may ask? - Because the writing is first rate, and the subject matter and how deftly he explains all the Nanotechnology is worth the read alone. - I guess this is one book, I cannot wait until the movie, so maybe they can make the ending better.

B00006LFGD|3.0|When I first heard that Barbra would be coming out with a &quot;Duets&quot; album, I immediately thought that it would follow the format of Frank Sinatra's Duet album of all NEW duets.  I was disappointed when I found out it was yet ANOTHER collection of old material, with only TWO NEW DUETS.  I was very excited when I found out that one of the duets would be with Barry Manilow, but when I heard it, thought it was very bland and generic sounding.  I was also excited to hear that she was going to sing with Josh Grobin, and that song is certainly quite exciting.  But, what about all the other great singers out there that she could be doing all NEW duets with to make a whole full album.  Here are a few suggestions:  Barbra should sing duets with:...Liza Minnelli, Roslyn Kind (her own half-sister), Steve Perry, Jane Olivor, Linda Eder, Julie Budd, Kenny Loggins, Tony Bennett, Shirley Bassey, Stevie Wonder, and most definitely should reunite with Donna Summers.  And maybe even Karen Carpenter using the same technology they did with the Nat King Cole / Natalie Cole duet &quot;Unforgettable&quot; and Richard Carpenter could even produce it.  Now THIS would be an exciting album.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams is, hands-down, the finest composer of our time. Given the sheer volume of his work, it's amazing how consistently good he still is after so many years. His score for \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is just as good as the first, carrying over the light bells and woodwinds he employed to craft Harry's theme and charging it with excitement that brought the scenes from the book to mind even before I'd seen the movie.<br />Williams has crafted some of the most recognizable heroic themes in movie history. Think about it -- Superman. Indiana Jones. Luke Skywalker. And now Harry Potter. Each has a brilliant, distinctive theme that brings his story to mind the minute you hear it, and all of them came from the baton of John Williams.<br />I only hope he manages to score the entire Harry Potter franchise (as he's done for \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" thus far). After such amazing work, anyone else would be a disappointment. (For evidence of that, check out the music from \\"Superman\\"s II-IV.)
630521610X|4.0|This was a very good Horror film. It is the one that Scary Movie mostly made fun of. It is about a teenager named Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell) whose mother was brutally killed one year ago, is being stalked by a killer in a small town in California called Woodsboro. She and her best friend Tatum(Rose McGowan) hear that their classmate Casey(Drew Barrymore) and another teen have been killed. After the killer pursues Sidney in her house, she thinks that it is her boyfriend Billy(Skeet Ulrich). But after Billy is released from jail, she believes that it is the person who she thinks murdered her mother. Then she goes to a party with Tatum, Randy(Jamie Kennedy),and Deputy Dewey(David Arquette). And thats when more murders start to occur.......                                                                                                                           I thought that this movie was fair. It was sort of like Halloween. Wes Craven did a good job with A Nightmare On Elm Street already so he is still a good director. One of the best Horror films is here. Rent it today.....
B00005JL3A|1.0|I admit, I was suckered into the DVD by the soundtrack, but hearing Manson doesn't make up for such a waste of cinema.  I would rather have seen Jovavich running around without any attempt at putting a movie around it.  If you like film, then don't waste your time seeing this much less buying it.  However, if you like video games, then it's probably up your alley.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is a great way to introduce someone to Journey, whether the person is a new fan or is trying to make the transition from Steve Perry's departure after Trial By Fire.<br />The DVD was taped for a Direct-TV special and it features the current Journey line-up of lead singer Steve Augeri, guitarist Neal Schon, keyboardist Jonathan Cain, bassist Ross Valory and drummer Deen Castronovo.<br />The DVD is a full concert featuring Journey's greatest hits, including songs such as &quot;Open Arms,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop Believin',&quot; and &quot;Any Way You Want It.&quot; It also includes new songs &quot;Higher Place&quot; and &quot;All the Way.&quot;<br />Seeing Journey live is such a different experience than listening to a CD. I've seen the current lineup four times in concert, and this DVD captures the emotion and raw energy of the concerts! You may just find yourself blasting the music, dancing, and singing along!<br />Steve Perry fans: Some of you may be wary of Steve Augeri, but this DVD shows that he can do justice to Journey's hits while maintaining his own vocal style. Contrary to what some people say, he really isn't a dead ringer for Perry. This may turn you to a new era of Journey!<br />Overall, the sound quality is awesome and the video is great. This is a great substitute if you can't make it to a Journey concert!
B000000OU4|4.0|I'm not to much of a Pat Metheny fan but the cut \\"To the end of the World\\" makes this CD worth the price. This cut shows what a talented artist Metheny really is and that he can truly create a lot of emotion from his music.  I'd consider this CD a \\"must have\\"!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I never buy CD's. They always disappoint and turn out to be just a waste of money and time. I will like one song, and that is it. Not so with Room for Squares. This CD is perhaps the best purchase that I have made for a while. It is awesome. I like every song on the CD, and that is a very rare thing. Slowly but steadily the songs begin to grow on you.<BR> I took a tough German exam today, and on the way home from school, all I could think of was sitting back and relaxing to this great music. If you want something refreshingly different, something to suit your taste if you consider yourself a bit of a 'square', I recommend checking out John Mayer!
0871294273|5.0|The Hobbit is a great book.  I read it for the first time after seeing the first Lord of the Rings movie.  The story of the hobbit happens before the Lord of the Ring.  It tells of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who is the first to find the ring.  He finds it by accident when he is trying to help some dwarves to get their treasure back.  Bilbo and the dwarves are in a cave where they have been captured by some Gobblins.  All of the others escape with the help of Gandalf the wizard, but Bilbo is left behind. As soon as he finds the ring on the ground a monster named Gollum shows up and wants to eat Bilbo. Bilbo is very scared but he slips the ring onto his finger and disappears because it is a magic ring.  This is just one of the adventures that Bilbo has in the Hobbit, but it is the most important one because that is how the magic ring comes to the Shire where Frodo gets it.  All of these stories were written by J. R. R. Tolkien who just made them up and told them to his kids.  But Tolkien was a famous historian and he knew a lot about the past, so this book is based on history.  I like it a lot and will soon read the Lord of the Rings.
0380778556|4.0|We chose this book for our senior project and it has turned out really good so far, we didnt really think the book was going to be this interesting and it keeps you wondering through out the whole thing. It's told by a nameless Mrs. De Winter who is living in the shadow of her husband's dead wife. She starts to uncover a mystery surrouding the wifes death and learns the truth about the former Mrs. De Winter. Be prepared for a surprise ending, it keeps you wondering. This is a MUST READ!!
0066214122|1.0|I really enjoyed this plot when I saw it on STAR TREK TNG a decade ago . . . This is a far cry from the originality he displayed in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. Futuristic stories that are based on humanity like in the novel CLONED LOVE is the road to originality in the sci-fi world. This novel fails to bridge that gap.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is based on the six DVD box set.<br />I won't reiterate what's already been written--it is well-done, a superb television drama.<br />I will say that it had a greater impact on me than &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; since BoB was based on the book by the same name, a factual recounting of the men of E Company, 101 Airborne.  These men were not characters from someone's imagination, but real people.  What was terrific was the way the telewriters handled the veteran's interviews.  While each episode begins with comments from veterans, not until episode 10 are the veterans identified.  This added to the impact of the miniseries.  I thought they were just men who happened to serve in the 101st at the time, or were in the general area of the battles.  Turned out that they were the actual men portrayed.  I won't say who--you've got to watch BoB to find out.<br />I saw the DVD before I read the book.  I initially thought the weakest written and portrayed man of E Company was David Schwimmer's CAPT Sobel.  Since the rest of the actors were all unknowns, I thought that having the actor from the popular TV show &quot;Friends&quot; was a way to generate buzz for the series, though in my opinion, distracting.  However, after reading the book, Schwimmer's rendition of CAPT Sobel was accurate, and actually slightly toned-down.  Plus, Schwimmer bears a close resemblance to the real CAPT Sobel (there's a picture in the book).  I'd say now he got the part based on merit.<br />BTW, my girlfriend is Taiwanese, a history buff, but not well-read in Western history.  She loved the DVD, every episode held her interest--and she hates violent films.
0441172717|5.0|A science fiction classic revisited after re-reading Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's prequels (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino).  <br />With the recent release of Butlerian Jihad, I wanted to go back and re-read the series, to refresh myself on the details of the story.  While reading Dune over again (for the fifth or sixth time), I continue to be amazed by the framework that Frank created for the Dune series development.  From the starting chapters, the reader is immediately transported into the setting, and the urgency of the situation.  He uses a combination of techniques to effectively suspend disbelief,including the shifting of viewpoints of the story protagonists, and a well developed backstory, illustrated by the introductory quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  <br />It was well worth reading one of the treasures in my library and one of the top ten science fiction books of all time.
B000077VPU|1.0|I have bought this DVD 2 months ago from Australia.  I really wish I have never bought it at all.  Do yourselves a favor, save your money or buy &quot;WE WILL ROCK YOU&quot;  DVD instead if you don't have one.  It is much much much better.
0066214122|4.0|I could not put this book down. In all, I finished it in just under five hours. Gripping is hardly the word for it. <BR>Crichton has again brought us a high-tech novel that studies the recent advances in science and technology. <BR>In this book, a company 'accidently' releases a group of nano-particles in to the air. They have some intelligence, communication and power skills, and are equipped with a PREDPREY programming that allows them to learn from mistakes. In the wild, they begin to evolve, gaining a group intelligence and create their own reproduction lab. Now, they're trying to get back into the lab that they started in. And they're hungry. They kill several people and animals, using their bodies for materials.<BR>What happens is unexpected and exciting as the programmers inside struggle to find out what's going wrong.<br />I found somethings difficult in the book. First, the main character takes a long time figuring things out. What the particles can do, the difficulty with his wife and what's going on with some other programmers. It fits his character, but is painful to read at times. <BR>His kids are nothing short of annoying. The same thing popped up in Jurassic Park: Annoying kids. At least this time they didn't play much of a role, although we do see them here and there. <br />Crichton follows a predictable pattern with his novels. Like Timeline and Jurassic Park, the book is about the hubris of scientists, and how their actions are doomed to fail.<BR>There are some strong parallels with Jurassic Park in this book. Genetic Engineering is a large portion, except that it is nano-manufacturing. For a majority of the book, the characters are cooped up inside their labratory, like in JP, and there is also a scene where the characters go the the breeding grounds of the particles, like in JP. The pattern is danger, hiding/studing/arguing, then boldness and the solution of the problem. There's nothing wrong with this, but it is predictable. <br />Like in Timeline, Crichton also gave us a slew of scientific information about the sciences in the book and that are being worked on now. I've enjoyed reading this, and it makes the book worth reading, if only to get the current happenings in a science world. Its all very interesting. <br />The result is an excellent, well paced read, that is painstakingly studied and has all the elements of a great book. Action, explaination, and a very interesting science problem.
B000075BFK|5.0|When I heard Tupac was releasing another album of unreleased songs I didn't know quite what to expect. After all hes been dead 6 years so I was thinking maybe this album was not going to match up to previous ones.<br />Anyway I went out to buy the album and all I gotta say is WOW!! This album is off the hook! This is one of Pac's best albums and it comes 6 years after his death, which makes it even more amazing. It is not quite on the same level as 'ALL EYEZ ON ME' but hey no album will ever be on the same level as that.<BR>This proves Tupac is the best rapper ever and maybe even the best artist in history. Thing is these days there are too many artists out there that put out disappointing albums or satisfactory albums and they are alive, but this guy he been dead 6 years and put out an album of this class. That is just unbelievable...double album as well and supposedly he at the peak of his career. Hes stealing 2pac's songs but even then his album is nothing compared to Tupacs album and if you dont believe me just read the reviews of that album.<br />CD 1<BR>1.

B00005K3LW|5.0|This and the first Die Hard are the best in the series. This is a different kind of Die Hard, but its non-stop action from start to finish! Go get it!
B00000055E|2.0|Well this is not quite the best Tupac album ever. Im not saying its bad im just saying compared to albums he has put out in the past for example All eyez on me and Me against the world this album is not as good.<br />Ru still down features two disks but one must say that if they had just added the best songs onto one disk this album would have been better.<BR>For me standout tracks on this album are first off from disk 1, Open fire, the title track R U Still Down (remember me), I wonder if heaven got a ghetto and to be honest I can only pick out one good song from disk 2 which is Do For Love.<br />Its not really a good example of what Tupac was really about. The beats are lame at times and dont really appreciate Tupacs lyrical capabilities. Saying that this album is way better than some albums other artists have been releasing and one the reasons I am a bit disappointed with this album is because of the quality of past projects. It really does give you the idea that someone has just put these songs together and hope they will please fans because Tupac is singing it.<br />If someone picked up this album and had not heard of Tupac before this moment they wouldnt think much of it and it would be left picking up dust.<br />If you really love Tupac you should get this album but personally if I were you I would try to find someone that has it and just borrow it off them for a few days. A bit disappointing.
B00005BCOL|5.0|PFT!!!  HISS!!!<br />Whatta CAT FIGHT!!!<br />I've loved this film for years -- perhaps more every time I see it!  This was the classroom for those \\"Dynasty\\" broads!  It is surely one of the best examples of ensemble performance.<br />The first inkling I ever had of this film was in the 197(?) Los Angeles Film Exposition's tribute to Rosalind Russell.  They showed clips from about 15 of her films, and what they showed from \\"The Women\\" was the exercise scene.  After that, I was on a mission to see the film (prevideo!).  But, Roz isn't the only star shining -- they all do -- even the bit players (\\"So, whatta they want you to do?  Lay an egg?\\").<br />The script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin (adapted from the Clare Boothe play) is extraordinarily wonderful.  What dialogue!<br />If you haven't had an appreciation for Norma Shearer before, -- well, you certainly will after seeing this film.  And Joan Crawford -- \\"Crystal Allen\\" may be the woman we'll all like to hate best forever.<br />Oddly, there was no Academy Award nomination for any aspect of this film (perhaps there was an anti-George Cukor movement abroad in 1939 -- he was fired from \\"Gone With the Wind\\" remember), not even Adrian's costumes (just get a load of what he put on Roz!).<br />If you've never seen \\"The Women\\" -- shame on you!!
B000075BFK|5.0|Well when I found out Tupac was releasing another album with more unreleased material I was thinking it was going to ruin his legacy in that the material he would release now wouldnt be as good as past stuff.<br />Anyway I went out and bought the album and all i gotta say is WOW!!! <br />This album is totally off the hook!! This proves that Tupac was the best rapper ever. The thing is there are some rappers that cant release a decent album when they are alive but this guys been dead 6 years and he comes up wid dis. All I gotta say that is totally amazin and it blew me away. <br />It may not quite be up there with \\"all eyes on me\\" but hey then again no album will ever be.<BR>There isnt a bad song on this album they are either good or amazing.<br />1. intro - news reporter reporting on where these tupac songs  are coming from then a countdown till release of album<BR>2. still ballin (10/10)<BR>3.

B000002BFZ|5.0|On contrary of what the above reviewer said, No Code does indeed have songs which got radioplay.  I remember sitting in my room when I first heard Who You Are come over the waves, a very hypnotic track, mantra like.  I also remember hearing the songs Hail Hail, and Red Mosquito.  All and all a solid album, really rocks from beginning to end.  Not the mid career slump that many fans call it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album ever made not only by 2pac but by any other artist. Nothing and I mean nothing can compare to this album. <BR>Ive had this album for years now but have just decided to review it. The thing is sometimes you pick up and album and after a couple of days you bored of it or maybe even a couple of months. Ive been listenin to this album for over 5 years and im still not bored of it. <BR>A large portion of 2pac's greatest hits CD was made up of these songs. This album has Tupac at his best and this is a must for any true rap fan. Forget you ja rule's and jay z's this is whats its all about.<br />If you dont know about 2pac and want to get into his work and not sure about what cd to pick up. Pick this one up. It will probably be the most [pricey] CD there but there is a reason for it. Cos its the best one there.<br />CD1 has tunes like all about u, how do u want it, 2 of amerikaz most wanted, my personal fav life goes on, california luv remix, the classic i aint mad at cha, whats ya phone number<br />cd 2 got tunes like cant c me, shorty wana b a thug, holla at me,wonder y they call u b****, picture me rollin, and all eyez on me<br />AMAZING
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is one of the best books of all time. It is a hypnotic and dazzling book that to me destroys the competition in the amazing fantasy catagory. This is a book that will stay with me and I will get the sequel as soon as possible.
0316666343|1.0|The Lovely Bones is written on a fifth-grade level. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is awkward and pedestrian. This is the only book I've ever read where the author starts the book with a certain cadence to her prose and never veers from it. Unbelievable that she could maintain the same boring rhythm throughout the book by having every sentence march to the same beat. There also seems to be a notable lack of vocabulary. Maybe the idea was to have everything sound like it was coming from the land of the dead. The author succeeded in that respect. The book reads more like a first-draft produced by a novice rather than a book written by a professional. If I had written it myself, I would have been too embarrassed to submit it to a publisher.
B00006AL1G|5.0|I've watched this documentary dozens of times.  A must for every turntablist.  Even watched it with the director's commentary.  I hope Doug Pray eventually rereleases this DVD with more footage about areas he missed like the International scene and gets more interviews with DJs like A-Trak and the Scratch Perverts.
B00006LWSF|4.0|First off,I really don't like rap music at all,but for some reason I really liked the music on the cd.Mostly the one I really liked was Lose Yourself.If you like rap music and loved this soundtrack,you'll love the movie as well.
0451528018|4.0|I read an bridged copy of this book when I was just a boy. It was a good book then. I decieded that I would reread this book. I was surpised that not much was taken out. It was still a good book. I am looking into getting more Holmes' books.
0800179501|3.0|This movie deserves only 3 stars instead of 3 for the following reasons:<br />1) There are no extras other than the trailer on this DVD.   Why didn't Columbia Home Video include the trailers for the two sequels?  Why didn't they get Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita (academy-nominated for this role) or director John G. Avildsen to supply commentary?<br />2) The movie was shot in 1.85:1 which means that the movie was shot full frame (1.33:1) but was projected in the theatre with the top and bottom blocked.  This practice gives a widescreen look to movies.  Since 'The Karate Kid' was done this way, pan and scan was not needed.  You actually see more but this causes the composition to be a little off because there is so much space above the actor's heads.  Funny thing, The Karate Kid parts 2 & 3 are letterboxed.  Does this mean that an old video transfer was used for this DVD?<br />3) Where's the Dolby 5.1?
B00005JKCH|5.0|Who are these [people] saying Spider-man was bad? I mean really now who are they, this was one of the most entertaining movies of the decade and these people are complaining about \\"not enough action\\" and \\"slow pace\\", did you want constant explosions? Did you want them to just ignore the fact that Spider-man has an origin, I mean really. And whats with the people saying the special effects are bad? Do they work for george lucas or something? Where the heck did they see better special effects. Spider-man is a great movie and a great starting off point for a whole slew of movies. And for those who say its too much like superman and batman: All super heroes have to get their powers somehow, of course the first movies will have a basic line to them, they all have to introduce the character and story, what the heck do they expect. So go buy the movie and dont listen to these people who are all [crabby] cause they were expecting ghandi but with spider powers.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I know alot of this is old hat to many of you, but for those who haven't heard &quot;One Less Bell/A House Is Not A Home are in for an incredible treat.  I saw Barbra do this song on Burt Bacharach's T.V. special back in the early 70's.  It gave me goose bumps then and it still gives me goose bumps now.  Even though it is available on her Barbra Joan  Streisand album  which also includes her best performance ever on &quot;I Never Meant To Hurt You&quot;  get the Duets album for the sheer fun of having all those wonderful songs on one C.D.  This woman is absolutley amazing. Who has had a career like this or will ever have a career like hers?
B000075BFK|4.0|2pac is undoubtedly the best for eternity.  His lyrics have always brought a certain reality to each and every one of his song's.  No one will ever do what he has done to the rap scene.  Unlike the rappers of today, Pac wrote songs that had substance and meaning behind each and every word, it was if God blessed him w/the ability to turn emotions into perfectly rhyming and meaningful songs.  This ability to rhyme so simply makes u actually think when listening to any of Pac's songs, but on his newest realease, &quot;Better Dayz&quot;, the meaning and voice isnt &quot;there&quot; as much, retarding the listener's ability to be enraptured by his lyrics.  Pac would've obviously put his type of beats to these tracks but since he's not here to do it the feel of each song on this double disc release is lacking Pac's signature.  Often times during this CD u will find urself checking the track listing to see whether or not uve got the song on repeat.  The beats do not seem to change from song to song.  Therefore this new release from Pac only deserves a 4.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I have a friend who lives in Mexico and is devoted to Borges--&quot;my Borgitis&quot; he calls it.  I have Brahmitis and it must be satisfied regularly.  This is Brahms conducted by Solti--not much more needs to be said.  The power, the nuance, the drama and the innovation of Brahms all captured by a great Brahm's conductor.

B00005QIPH|4.0|I'll have to admit, I didn't like The Strokes at first. I listened and listened but couldn't connect with anything. They seemed a bit too much of a nostalgia band. Then I heard \\"Hard To Explain\\" again, and for some reason I became hooked, not just on that song but on the album as a whole. Now I love this album and its great instrumentation and arrangements, combined with catchy lyrics. It will be interesting to see what they put out next. Pick up this album A.S.A.P.!
B000000Y27|5.0|This album is, simply put, brilliant.  The whole album is perfect.  Wes manages to make his solos harmonically complex but still melodic.  I've transcribed most of Wes' solos on this album, and it never ceases to amaze me how clever and inventive they are.  They're so catchy that you can hum them after hearing them once, but they're also so complex that you can listen to them thousands of times and they'll still sound fresh.  You could practically learn how to play jazz guitar from this; Wes' solo on West Coast blues is the standard of excellence in jazz guitar playing.  Everything Wes plays seems to fit perfectly; there is not a single note that seems out of place.  Buy this album to learn what jazz guitar should sound like.
B000065U1N|5.0|I read the book.  I saw the movie. The movie is a faithful transcription to the screen of the book it is based upon.  The director and story editor did an outstanding job of compressing Mr. Bowden's book into its screen version.  The musical score is perfect. As previosuly written in a review of Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down is so much more honest and therefore, better than Saving Private Ryan because it is the truth.  There are no throwaway characters reflecting the moral quivering of should I fire my weapon that you had in the character Oppen in Saving Private Ryan. You have young men and older men being their human best in a situation totally unexpected.  You do not need some Oppen character and his cowardice to understand the terror that many of the men felt during the firefight that the movie conveys. The movie shows their fear and their dedication to their oath and fellow soldier.  Unlike the review in Slate.com, the book and the movie are not social commentaries on whether a war is just or not or how many blacks should constitute a unit, etc.  Do not view this movie for that, just as one would not watch (original or remake) Stalingrad for some social commentary on the [Jewish people].  This is a movie faithful to depicting a sobering day in the history of the US Army and this country and our attempts at doing good in the world.  This is a great movie.
6302787297|1.0|As a fictional tale of a man who did not historically exist, this film could potentially be a decent movie.  As an attempt to portray history, however, it is a wretched failure.  Not only does this film perpetuate the false heroic image of Christopher Columbus that already exists excessively, but it magnifies it.  Columbus is portrayed as endlessly peaceful and sympathetic and harboring too much fascination with the \\"Indian\\" cultures to concern himself with the quest for gold.  This is an outrageously false portrayal of a man who led a ruthless slavery system followed by genocide of Native American cultures.  A film like this is dangerous because it is interpreted as a true account of history when, in fact, it is horribly false
B00006CXSS|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD.  I have not read the book it is based upon, so I cannot comment on its faithfulness to the book.  There are specific episodes that I believe are outstanding.  The one where Easy Company is in the Argonne Forest, I believe. I suppose what makes this series appealing is its honesty and its basis on actual events and people, unlike Saving Private Ryan.  Like Black Hawk Down, these are real people experiencing real events.  There are no throw away ( the moral quandry of war) characters like \\"Oppen\\" (sp?) in Saving Private Ryan.  It's the real thing.  My only regret about this miniseries is that it premiered on the Sunday night, September 9th, just before the Islamic terror attacks on the US.  Perhaps it was coincidence, but the themes of good fighting evil, of free people fighting to free others, rings oh so true and timely.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek 2 has always been one of my favorites of the Trek movies. I was immediately enticed to buy the Director's Edition DVD. Hearing about and seeing what went on behind the scenes of a movie I grew up loving is awesome. The interviews were interesting, and the documentaries showed how this movie brought life back into the franchise and changed things forever. <br />There are a few new scenes in the movie, which only someone who's seen in a billion times can pick out, but add to the movie I think. We get to see Scotty's emotional reaction to the death of his nephew, and more of Kirk talking with Carol Marcus. Just a few more seconds of footage here and there I felt made the characters more human and getting to know them better makes the whole movie more real. <br />This is definately worth buying, and I can't wait until Undiscovered Country and the Next Generation movies come out, because I know I'll either be back on Amazon or at my local Best Buy the moment I can order them.
0060523794|5.0|One caveat:  Lots of these reviews are really reviews of &quot;do I like Lou Gerstner?&quot; and not the ideas he offers in his book.  My review is about the book and whether its arguments are useful to business people.  On that basis alone, I rate it highly.<br />I thought his chapters on lessons learned are quite good, especially where he distinguishes between vision and strategy.  In my opinion, he offers a lot of great insight on this in a small amount of text.<br />I couldn't get a clear picture of whether people were treated with dignity in the downsizings.  On one hand, I've heard some pretty cold stuff outside of Lou's book.  On the other hand, I worked at IBM in the late '80s as an intern and the culture was DEEPLY complacent and isolated from the real world.  I suspect that the reality is somewhere in-between but the &quot;numbers guys&quot; argue one extreme while the people who paid the price argue just as forcefully the opposite extreme.<br />I also think his chapters on being willing to challenge the conventional wisdom were valuable.  I remember when Gerstner went to IBM and the conventional wisdom really WAS that Gerstner should become a high-tech hipster who could talk client/server acronyms, should 'harvest' the 390 business, and break the company into a bunch of 'baby blues.'  I think it underestimates his (and clearly IBM's) accomplishments to not acknowledge it took serious decision clarity and courage to go against that conventional wisdom at the time -- especially given the financial pressures on the firm.<br />So the bottom line is I think the book offers good insight for how to think clearly about your business, what your franchise really is, what your opportunities really are, and how to make clear decisions based on trusting a clear thought process that filters out lots of background noise.
B0000028UK|5.0|I own this album and Ten and out of the two, I like this more. There's more &quot;heavy&quot; songs, more &quot;soft&quot; songs, and much better songwriting. &quot;Blood,&quot; &quot;Animal,&quot; and &quot;Daughter&quot; come to mind as my favorites, but the whole CD is excellent. It's emotional, rocking, and soothing, all at the same time, making for a very fun listening experience. If you're new to Pearl Jam, this is a good place to start because each song has its own sound; even if you don't like straight-out &quot;grunge,&quot; there are plenty of songs of  other music styles like metal and even *gasp* indie folk. Not at all bad for a mainstream CD; the music really shows how Pearl Jam don't write songs for the radio but for themselves. Overall, an excellent purchase with something for everyone on it.
B00005MP58|2.0|This is an okay version of Pride and Prejudice, but not the most superior one. It strays from the book quite a bit (I don't recall Darcy jumping in swamps nor even fencing) The acting is bland exept for Julia Sawalha, who is most melodramatic and Jennifer Ehle's smirking gets old quickly. The scenery is beautiful, however and so are the costumes.<br />The 1979 BBC version, with a screenplay by Fay Weldon, is a far superior version. The movie is bang on with the book and the acting is fantastic--the actress portraying Lydia is a little histrionic and melodramatic, but the rest are pure perfection.
B000021Y7W|5.0|I have fond memories of watching a friend's copy of this over and over in the '80's!  When I saw it was being re-released, newly mastered, I had to have it.  This is maybe THE quintessential concert video ever!  It succeeds not because of a million-dollar light &amp; laser show, or shock value, but because it's just very creative and artistic in it's minimalism.  David Byrne is a genius, albeit a quirky one.  It's still awesome...I've turned my 7-year-old son into a Talking Heads fan!  There is some extra footage on this one, but it's tacked on to the end of the tape, instead of in the flow of the concert, which I thought was kind of strange.  Other that that my only gripe is that I didn't hold out for the DVD!  Buy it!!
B000068IEU|1.0|This isn't scary, disturbing, or disgusting, so what is the big deal about this film? There is nothing likable about this lousy excuse of a movie. Critics say that Friday the 13th is bad? Did they ever see this film? Friday the 13th is like a masterpiece compared to this filth! Don't see it, it is not worth your life or time!
0385503954|4.0|Overall I thought this was an excellent book. Especailly teh ending, I reread it seveal times. My only complaint is that at some points I felt that the book was dragging due to too much description.
079284131X|1.0|This wasn't scary at all! I'm very upset that I wasted a perfectly good rental on this lousy excuse for a film. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! It's not even funny, it's just plain stupid! Chucky stinks, if you want TRUE HORROR and not junk, check out Psycho, Halloween, or The Exorcist, You'll like those better I assure you.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|2001 - the year of Black Hawk Down, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and Training Day... and yet A Beautiful Mind snags the Best Picture Oscar? I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is COMPLETELY without redemption as a motion picture, but it comes complete with all the sappy Hollywood sentiment director Ron Howard could conjure. This isn't real emotion, it's melodrama, which is best left for daytime television. Is this movie more important than Black Hawk Down, more spectacular than The Fellowship of the Ring, or more original than Training Day? No. Definitely not. This movie wasn't made for an audience - it was made with an Oscar in mind. That's not good policy.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This is excellent! I loved it! It was scary! Not cheezy! SCARY!!! Watch it alone in the dark. Have fun being scared!
B000002UA0|5.0|Awesome is the only word to describe this album. Pink Floyd's first album, while not thier best(though almost there) is probally the best album to come out of the 60's. With Syd Barrett at the helm while his musical talent is still burning bright, Floyd makes a landmark album in not only pshchedellia but rock it self. Songs range from loud mostly musical pieces like Interstellar Overdrive, Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk, and Pow R. Toc H., to more traditional rock songs like Lucifer Sam, Astronomy Domine, and Matilda Mother, all the way to more softer, almost story like songs of The Scarecrow, Chapter 24, amd The Gnome. And lets never forget the ever cheerfull Bike at the end. This album is not only for Floyd or Syd fans, but for fans of classic rock, as this album is the most classic of them all.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Some people think that this movie is childish. I cannot stress how wrong that is! Believe me that this is one of the greatest movies you can watch. The plot is nice and goes like this: The monster world, Monstropolis, needs children's screams for energy.<BR>To get the energy, they need to go through doors and enter through children's closets and scare them, but it is a dangerous job because in Monstropolis, children are supposedly dangerous and toxic. Eventually, the main character, James P. Sullivan, (John Goodman), accidentally lets a tiny little girl named Boo, (Mary Gibbs) in. So eventually, it is up to Sullivan, or Sully as he is usually called, and his pal Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) to return Boo to the human world, but this is a hard job because of an evil chamelion monster known as Randall Boggs, (Steve Buscemi) gets in the way, and is out to capture Mike Wazowski at a certain point. This movie is simply awesome. There are two more things added in this movie. There are two animated short films, known as 'For The Birds' and Mike's New Car.' In 'For The Birds', some birds sit down and chirp at each other and argue, and then a larger bird sits down, and the birds try to kill it, and very nearly kill themselves. In Mike's New Car, Mike Wazowski buys a new car, lets Sully in, and then there are some accidents, and Sully can't figure out what to do. Eventually the car explodes and Mike appears burnt to a crisp. Also there is a sneak-in of the video 'Finding Nemo.' I give this film the highest recommendation I can give a film!

0375414053|4.0|The details of Kate's life are just right, but I thought the denouement was inconsistent with her enjoyment of her work.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun!  A good story, good character development and good morals.  Cute characters too.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This album is indeed a compilation, not a real album.  But in that context, it is quite good.  Its nice to have songs like Sliver, SLTS, and other popular songs all easily available on one disk.  The casual Nirvana fan will love it and others can still enjoy throwing it in the CD player during a car trip.  Is it the ultimate compilation for the hardcore fan?  Heck no.  If you're a hard core fan, stay away.  But that doesn't make it crap.  If you only want one Nirvana album, buy this one.  If you're a big fan, you don't need this album.
006092988X|3.0|My school English group had to read this book for a project. This book is a classic literature book about a girl named Francie growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 20th century. The novel provides a really shocking view of hardships that grip the lower class, even today. From a suburban middle-class teenager point of view, it was a really in depth and profound story. But, everybody including myself in the group, had a difficult time reading this. Though we were allowed to choose from a wide variety of novels, we were drawn to this particular one. But, we found the story too long, not interesting enough for our age group, and it had too many dry spells without really appealing action. Until you get to the 22nd chapter, events don't seem to move along quickly enough. Though there are quite a bit of attention-grabbing scenes that some parents might call inappropriate (mention of condoms, vulgar language, etc.), those were the most interesting to my group. For parents or adults that are considering giving this book to a young adult, make sure that they like history, long novels, and are interested in social problems effecting the world. More forward-thinking teens that are interested in more &quot;sociable&quot; subjects may not like this particular book.
B00004XONN|5.0|This atmospheric album carries you through one mood after another after another...Radiohead is unafraid to experiment with sounds that will absolutely blow your mind.  Sophisticated yet raw, crude at times but always effective...My favorite cut on the album is &quot;The National Anthem,&quot; which sounds like Frank Zappa threw a jam session and invited Led Zeppelin and John Coltrane along for company.  It just keeps building and building to a wailing climax.  After that, they bring you back down to earth with the mellow &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Treefingers.&quot;  Highly recommended!
B000062XM7|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans is an awesome historic movie, but also a touching adventure. Not only is Daniel Lewis an awesome shooter, he is passionate and creative in this epic story of love and war. MUCH  better than the book. The war scene's are very graphic, but sooooooooo wonderful. Not a Hollywood's version- the actual version. if you are looking for an awesome movie you will love an treasure forever, check out...... The Last of the Mohicans!!
B00003CXI1|3.0|I was one of the people who said that they would never read the Harry Potter books, but I was talked into at least trying the book, and actually I have fallen in love with them, but when I tried the movie after I had read the book, it was a terrible disappointment. As is the case with most movie versions of books. They left out the best parts of the book. The acting was okay...good for the age of the kids and the fact that some had never acted professionally before this movie. I was just very disappointed though because they just skipped major parts of the book that would have worked very well in the movie. I did give it three stars though because it was kind of entertaining, but could have been much better.

B00006F7S4|2.0|I was really looking forward to listening to Sea Change, but was very disappointed.  I find it almost unlistenable - the sad droning, non-stop waa waa waa, and the depressing melancholoy that infuses everything on this disc is too much.  And I *am* sorry to say this because I think Beck's work is brilliant and innovative.  It is definitely NOT a five star album.  (Rolling Stone, Robert Hillburn - what WERE you thinking????)
0316666343|4.0|During my first year as a college student, my interpreting literature class our professor divided us into eight different groups.  Our group chose to read &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold.  We chose the book because it was going to be interesting and sounded interesting.  I enjoyed the book very much and the suspence of finding the killer kept my interest.  I also thought that the author showed an excellent point of view.  She shows susie, the main character, can see down on earth from heaven.  When we talked in the group we talked deeply about our opinions about heaven and hell.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading and thinking about heaven.
0140187537|2.0|We're not given a real protagonist.  The author cares more -- much more -- about the sacred cows of his language and metaphor than about character.  Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard graduate and a scion of old money who goes to work as a clerk in a grocery store because his father has squandered said old money.  This is in 1948, and we meet him 12 years on, still in the same grocery store, still doing menial labor, in 1960.  A college graduate was still a rather rare commodity in 1948, certainly a Harvard grad.  Why on earth would such a man be willing to sweep floors and stock shelves for 12 years?  We are never told.  Why does he suddenly awaken and become ambitious in 1960? (this is the Easter metaphor -- the old Ethan dies and a new one arises)  We are never told.  Why does his ambition coincide with moral depravity?  We are never told.<br />  He is not only a Harvard grad, he is impossibly witty, glib, and, all of a sudden, street smart.  No such person would have sat still so long, any such person could have made money in 1948-1960 without cutting corners morally to a significant degree, and no such person would be surprised that cutting corners morally in pursuit of wealth would make him feel so bad that he might not be able to live with himself.<br />Steinbeck wanted to make a statement about the sad state of morals in 1960 America, but immorality was not unique to that time, or our time, or the late '30s (Grapes of Wrath), or the Roman Empire or the Russian Steppes or anyplace or anytime else.  Immorality is the oldest story in the book, so if you want to talk about it through characters, there is no reason for doing so other than simply as an excuse to write good characters, but Steinbeck fails to do that.  Margie and Joey, friends of Ethan, are also like him: ambitious and impossibly perspicacious and witty, yet somehow stuck in dead-end lives year in and year out in a dead little town. It's a silly, tiresome book, micro-smart but macro dumb dumb dumb.
6305910189|4.0|There may be a bit of confusion with regard to this DVD, since there are two versions, \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan\\" and \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan: The Director's Edition (Special Edition).\\" The later was released in August 2002 and the non-directors edition was released in July 2000. The aspect ratio of both editions are the same, widescreen, 2.35:1, anamorphic 16 x 9.  The surround sound is the same also, Dolby Digital 5.1.<br />It should be a no-brainer to select the Director's Edition. Not only is it a newer release but it is four minutes longer (116 min. vs. 112 min.) - hinting that there is extra material.  Amazon.com also is selling the Director's Edition cheaper.<br />I've owned this film in several formats including laserdisc.  I was always disappointed in the transfer to laserdisc of S.T. II.  It looked washed out and the reds were oversaturated.  Other Star Trek films were excellent.  Fortunately, the transfer to DVD was much better executed. Although, I haven't seen the Director's Edition (yet), I suspect it is at least as good.  I am still somewhat disappointed that only Dolby Digital 5.1 is provided on the DVD instead of the superior DTS surround sound format.
B0000042MY|3.0|LAST OF THE MOHICANS is one of the better films of recent memory.  Unfortunately, the score is hit and miss.  While composers Jones (DARK CITY) and Edelman (GETTYSBURG) both have extensive soundtrack credits, their 'combined' work here is schizophrenic.  Both composers present beautiful themes, but overall the album has a strange, unsatifying feel about it.  The music ranges from gorgeous to pedestrian and one of my problems with this album is that the main title motif pops up ad nauseum all over the place.  James Horner did this to much better effect on his BRAVEHEART score, often using the same or similar motifs throughout.  Here, the beautiful main title is ground into dust.  It's like my father said after first hearing the album, &quot;Half of these songs sound the same.&quot;  That's because THEY ARE.  It's literally the same theme over and over and it gets to be tiresome.  It's almost as if Jones was suffering from a mental block and was unable to compose more than a few different songs for the film so he just kept bringing the one big theme back over and over.  The fact the Edelman also does some music may lend creedence to this theory.  When was the last time you saw a major film that had two different composers penning its score?  I can't think of any off hand.  It would be like John Williams and James Horner each scoring half of the next Spielberg film, or Bernard Herrmann scoring half of a Hitchcock film with someone else.  Or John Barry scoring half of a JAMES BOND film.  It's just wierd.  This score is more like half and album -it never really comes together the way it should.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I didn't know if it was a good idea or not to buy this one when I heard it was old material.Than I remembered being much more impressed by their first album than by the second, in fact I don't especially like Toxicity, I don't think It has the fun and power of the first one.Then I saw the cover-or the lack of cover and to me it meant they were back with all the ingredients that made the first album a real blast...and STEAL THIS ALBUM is a blast!True metal with a twist of punk and of course the unique Rick Rubin's Production.S.O.A.D. might be a political-oriented band but they should be able to NOT just throw it in our faces-humour is very good way to put the finger on problems- if they don't want to end up like RAGE AGAINST or the french band TRUST(r.i.p.).I believe STEAL THIS ALBUM is the right balance.Bravo!

B00005JL78|4.0|I guess I will have to be a voice of reason here, but I found MINORITY REPORT to be a *bit* underwhelming.  The film has some great ideas and does a good job bringing them to the screen.  The acting was good (even Tom Cruise who I don't usually care for) and the script was good as well.  I felt that the effects were much more realistic than say STAR WARS EPISODE II, mainly due to the use of some real cars, ships etc (a la BLADE RUNNER) and not an overabundance of CG work.  MINORITY REPORT treads the thin line between present and future with style and grace.  It also raises some thorny questions -like all good sci-fi films do.  Just how far are we [mankind] willing to go to save lives and prevent crimes?  The creepy thing about the film is that many aspects of it do not seem to require a huge stretch of the imagination.  The genious of Spielberg here is in the mixing of the familiar elements of our time with just enough futuristic change.  The ubiquitous advertising and retinal scanning are probably closer than we think.  While the film never achieves the serious tone of BLADE RUNNER, both are kindred spirits.<br />For all of its positives, I found myself rather unmoved by the whole experience.  This is not to say that I did not enjoy the movie.  I thought it was good and had some powerful things to say.  But the incessant hype about the film had me expecting the best thing since sliced bread.  I have not felt particularly antsy to watch the film again, although I'm sure I will eventually.  I would not put this in the category of &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi film, but it is certainly one of the better efforts in recent memory.<br />The DVD contains a large amount of extras which are *mostly* informative and entertaining.  The standard fare items are here: storyboards, commentary, interviews, photographs, effects discussions etc.  MINORITY REPORT is a film that should be seen by everyone at least once.  Some of you will love it and others of you will not care one bit.

B00007E8V4|5.0|I bought this album a few days ago, and I can't stop listening to it.  Over and over again it plays in my CD player.  I can't say enough about this album, literally. It's the most inventive rock/metal I have ever heard, and I have heard allot.  With heart rending rhythms and head pulsating drum/bass riffs, this music is truly heaven.  System of a down have achieved what no one else in the history of music has even attempted, to create such diverse yet coherent music, that no matter what your mood, creed, or age, this music is for you.  The lead singer of SOAD (Serj tankian) has the most enchanting voice ever to grace and grate the music industry.  Serj tankian melts your soul with emotional wails, and grinds your mind into dust with mosh pit growls.  System of a Down has delivered, delivered with flying banners and smoke on the horizon.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but this has blown me away.  I knew this album was going to be good, but oh my god... I never knew it was going to be like this. Watch out for these guys, they are going to rule the world some day.
B000003TAR|5.0|At first, word leaked to the media that they'd recorded an unlistenable sonic abomination of an album.  <BR>Then the word on the street was that Cobain and company's follow-up to the supernova success of Nevermind was going to be even more commercial. <BR>How else, then, to kick off In Utero than with the loud, disgust-filled unpleasant burst of guitars that for a split second on initial listen has the world thinking, \\"uh...so much for radio play\\", but then kicks off into an honest-to-God guitar riff that sounds like a moodier and snottier son to the Beatles \\"Drive My Car\\".  Cobain kicks the voice of a generation tag in the [but]with the opening lines \\"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old\\".  No one in rock was ever this funny and poignant - as well as self-aware and blase - in the history of rock.<br />The loud/soft dynamic that Nirvana popularized on Nevermind still exists, but now those dynamics no longer exist within each song, but rather are at war with each other.  This disc presents the band's harshest, crudest songs (Scentless Apprentice, Milk It, Radio Freindly Unit Shifter), and Cobain's prettiest, most heart-wrenching ballads (Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea).<br />That opening line about being old is not for just cheap laughs either: Cobain's lyrics have a wisdom and a complexity that are years away from his \\"teenage angst\\"-ridden self on Nevermind.<BR>\\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" is simply a very poetic - and twisted - way of one lover telling another that he wishes he could take all her pain away.  \\"As i grew my bones hurt/They hurt really bad\\" is just retelling the world about Kurt's growing pains (more emotionally than physically).  My personal favorite is \\"A blanket acned with ciagrette burns\\" - whether Cobain is describing an actual object or his self-image here is worth questioning.<br />But no where does the band bring it all together than on All Apologies.  The song's lyric of fears of inadequacy and not being able to communicate all the singer wishes he could convey is contradicted (And Cobain was nothing if not a mass - and mess - of contradictions) with the line \\"Choking on the ashes of her enemy\\" - though you may defeat your foes, no matter what, they will always conquer and destroy you right back.<br />As masterful a lyric as it is, it's a shame that Cobain never came to realize that with time, all pains and wounds can be healed and left behind.
B000070WJE|3.0|I have been having a love affair with Robbie Williams’ music ever since I saw his tongue-in-cheek video for Millennium. His music, his style, and his presence had me hooked after I saw a mini-concert of his greatest hits on VH-1 in 2000. Unfortunately, his 1st American album, The Ego Has Landed (a compilation of songs from his first two U.K. albums Life Thru a Lens and I've Been Expecting You) did not go very far in the U.S. Robbie's lyrics were just too witty, sarcastic, and caustic for the typical pop music listener. His follow-up album, Sing When You’re Winning, was more of the same but with a more of a melancholy bent. Robbie was more introspective on this disc. With his latest offering, Escapology, one has to wonder from what he is trying to escape because this CD is full of the sounds and musings that made his previous albums hits abroad. Therein lies the problem.<br />Escapology is ground Robbie has covered 4-times over. He’s thoughtful, he’s brash, he’s rude, he’s introspective, he’s bitter, he contemplates his fame, but he isn’t bringing anything new to the table. The lyrics are drowned out by the overwhelming number of slow-tempo songs, and they all flow into one really long b**ch session. At the end of the album, you want to shout, &quot;Where’s the fun, Robbie?&quot; Compared to the VERY tried-n-true formula of American pop music flooding the airwaves in the U.S., Escapology is still head and shoulders above the rest in its originality and thoughtfulness.<br />The standout tracks on disc are the soul/R&amp;B-inspired duet &quot;Revolution&quot;  (with Rose Stone), the mid-tempo ballad &quot;Feel,&quot; the fun dance-rock song &quot;Hot Fudge,&quot; and the slightly uplifting &quot;Something Beautiful.&quot;<br />&quot;Me and My Monkey&quot; steals a riff from the O-Jays’ &quot;Backstabbers&quot; and &quot;Song 3&quot; has a few guitar chords that are reminiscent of Nirvana’s &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit.&quot; The intro to &quot;Cursed&quot; sounds like the intro to the TV show Miami Vice.<br />This album will probably disappoint current Robbie Williams’ fans, and make non-fans wonder what the big brouhaha was all about. Stick this disc on the shelf and buy his previous 4 albums (not counting the Frank Sinatra tribute &quot;Swing When You’re Winning&quot;).Cursed&quot; sounds like the intro to the TV show Miami Vice. <br />This album will probably disappoint current Robbie Williams’ fans, and make non-fans wonder what the big brouhaha was all about.

B00003CXCW|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorite <BR>oldie but goody pictures from yesteryear, and I<BR>cant add anything about it that someone hasn't <BR>already said in their review.  However, a couple<BR>of people mentioned in their reviews something<BR>about a &quot;widescreen&quot; version.  This picture was <BR>made in 1950, and as many times that I have seen<BR>it, I have never seen a widescreen version. Isn't<BR>this movie one of those in which the full-screen<BR>format is the original aspect?  At any rate, this<br />movie and DVD comes highly recommended!!
B00005T30L|2.0|Look, I'm an open minded movie lover.  I love The Royal Tenenbaums and Amelie, A Clockwork Orange and The Graduate, Eyes Wide Shut and Big Night and scores of other non-mainstream films.  I also like Scooby-Doo, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and a lot of other conventional fare.<br />But to me Ghost World is a mixed bag.  Great characterizations.  Some great dialogue.  Many nice moments.  The movie has heart.  But it hit too many false notes.  I can buy Thora Birch in her situation falling for Steve Buscemi, but Buscemi's character falling for the Dana character?  No.  The movie seems to play it off as just comedy.  Just that sort of inexplicable relationship that occurs to drive the third person in a love triangle insane.  I don't think so, not here.  This sort of perception is always what we have from afar.  In this movie we know too much about Buscemi and about the Dana character to believe that they'd spend more than two dates together.<br />Then there's the kooky hockey hair guy at the convenience store.  He just stepped out of another movie.  He'd be fine in another movie, but he feels out of place here, too broadly drawn.<br />The Josh character is underdeveloped and seems extraneous to the plot.  Maybe his story made more sense in the original screenplay and some of his scenes were deleted.  I didn't watch the deleted scenes on the DVD.<br />The Norman character, waiting for the bus, was just a lame device to set up the heavy-handed ending.  A metaphor that was not subtle enough to work.<br />The divide between Thora and her best friend happened too quickly, I thought.<br />The art teacher, while funny, was too much of a contradiction to be believable.  Yes, she's a dilettante with no talent.  But she's still not drawn from the beginning as the type to cut down true art like Thora's notebook sketches while lauding crap like the found object art of the teacup and tampon.  I think her character was set up as the type to prize everything the kids do as art.  Another false note.<br />And frankly, I think it's hard to root for a character like Thora's who doesn't really want anything.  She wants Buscemi, yes, but not really.  More the idea of him.  She rejects everything, fine, there are people like that in this world.  I can appreciate that.  But unless you're one of those people and relate to her because you're like her, then she's hard to relate to.  I don't think it's a universal human quality to reject everything.  There are a lot of characters I'm nothing like but that I still can root for or relate to because on some level they embody a universal truth or universal human quality.  Thora's character is not universal.  Okay.  Only... for this reason, most people won't like Ghost World.<br />Still and all, you've got to hand it to the filmmakers for their originality.  But this is not a solid movie all around.  It had a lot of potential...
B00000DFSK|5.0|To me, U2 is the King of music. Bono's lyrics are captivating and simply amazing. &quot;With or Without You&quot; still gives me chills. <br />For every emotion, there is a U2 song. If you want to listen to real music, and not the pop-computer-generated stuff we see so much to day, pick up a U2 CD.<br />I particularly like U2 Best of 1980-1990. Some of the great songs on this CD are &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;Pride(In the Name of Love).&quot;
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is excellent.  There are so many good things about it.  Christina's voice is strong and gorgeous.  The songs are different from each other, and each one stands out for it's own reason.  The lyrics are all worth listening to for one reason or another (they aren't just stupid pointless words).  I can't stress how amazing this album is.
B00004U8H4|4.0|The film changes plenty of Bret Easton Ellis's wonderful novel, but thankfully it retains the all-important ambiguity: does Patrick Bateman really engage in acts of unspeakable brutality, or are these merely the fantasies of a mind increasingly unhinged by the excesses of high-rent American hedonism?  A brave Christian Bale is unforgettable as the tragi-comic Bateman, and will have you thanking the fatally cautious Leonardo DiCaprio for passing on the role.  Writer/director Mary Harron perfectly captures the ambience of the novel, and the design by Gideon Ponte and Andrew M. Stearn goes a long way to making low-budget look high class.

0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton is just the man to bring Washington Irving's macabre little tale to the screen, and his gothic touch is deftly applied. He treats the material playfully but without losing any of the darkness that makes it so compelling. The result is movie with the perfect balance of horror and humour, leaving just enough space for the familial feud at the centre of Andrew Kevin Walker's tidy screenplay to see the light of day. The largely English cast is a joy to behold even in minor roles, as are the wonderful action sequences, subtle special effects, and stupendous art direction which more than deserved the Oscar it eventually won. But holding it all together is the performance of Johnny Depp as the nervous, eccentric Ichabod Crane. Depp shows, yet again, that he's one of the most under-rated and under-awarded actor in Hollywood. His versatility is astounding.
0783226063|3.0|Sometimes you need at least 20 hours of movie to tell a half of what is writen in a book. The same with Dune. And its 1984, so don't expect believable special effects. BTW, if you didn't like the DVD - read the book. If You think it is 5 star movie - read the book. If you are not sure you want to watch it - read the book.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Novelists are notoriously precious about adapting their work for the screen, and usually very bad at it.  John Irving is an exception and a deserving Oscar-winner for this screenplay which recognises the essential differences between a book and a film.  By pushing the history of abortion into the background, compressing the novel's timeline, and working in a little of \\"David Copperfield\\", Irving manages to reconfigure this story into a tale which is less about abortion and more about finding one's place in the world - and recognising, crucially, that those who want to make the world's rules first have to live in it.  The theme isn't hammered home, but is slowly allowed to declare itself through the experiences of Homer Wells, played with considerable skill and endearment by Tobey Maguire, and Dr. Wilbur Larch, in another great performance from Michael Caine.  This is what an adaptation should be: not a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved.  Irving's insightful book \\"My Movie Business\\" tells the tale of how it was done.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I can not express how moved I was by Becks' new album, Sea Change.  I'm delighted that there is an artist who can continue to make music that is forever changing.  Otherwise, I grow bored.  The toned-down expression of the tracks, compared to his earlier work, can only prove that he has talent to cross all boundries of music.  There are some very sobering moments I agree, like the track Already Dead, but the melody plucks at your heart.  This is progressive music, it strikes at the soul.  Beck can not be compared to anyone simply because all his albums are unprecedented.  But I believe if Jeff Buckley was still alive, he would be making music like this.
B00006SFLV|4.0|My So-Called Life is one of those instant classics.  A brilliant show, it just came along at the wrong time and was subsequently canned after one season.  But that only adds to the legend and in a small way makes the series even more enjoyable on DVD.  The writing never got a chance to waiver.  There was never really a bad episode.  The cast never had to grow up and face \\"the college years\\" or even prom.  Instead we are left with this one season, this one year of high school, with a brilliant group of characters who are locked forever in youth.<br />The shows themselves are just great.  When you compare this one series, sandwiched between the farce of the early 90s' Beverly Hills 90210 and the junk of the late 90s' Dawson Creek, you see how true, poignant and amazing these 19 hours of teen TV truly are. You also see how Hollywood knows very little about GOOD TV.<br />This is a classic.<br />(why did I not give the dvd 5 stars... if you are looking for extras, look somewhere else all you get is the show... in this case that is enough though.)
B00005JJX8|3.0|Not one of the master's top-notch efforts, but worth a look for the glamour, scenery, and some good lines. Besides, the DVD's nice selection of supplementary materials make up for the slight shortage of complexity and entertainment value provided by the movie itself. Extra points for the sharp new widescreen image, though, which at least restores \\"To Catch a Thief\\" to its former visual glory, always one of its strong suits.
0553212737|4.0|I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which! <br />The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly. <br />The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist. I definitely recommend it, but to at least a freshman in high school, because it is a challenging book.
B00005JL2O|2.0|While the Austin Powers began as something original, inventive and ingenious, its become nothing more than 90 minute excuse for annoying celebrity cameos and out-of-control product placement. <br />Austin Powers: Goldmember reminds me of one of those race cars covered in dozens of corporate stickers and driven by some has-been celebrity.  Its mere existence is designed simply to hold your attention long enough to look at the many products stamped all over it.<BR> <BR>Goldmember, while mildly amusing, is a classic example of a movie featuring characters in search of a story.  What story there is makes no sense and has more holes than a spaghetti strainer.  Why?  Because the film is motivated not by the need to tell a story, but by the need to create scenes for celebrity cameos and product placement.<br />The never-creative corporate suits have taken over the Austin Powers movies, and the need for product placement has outweighed the need to tell a story.<br />I love Mike Myers and his work but it's time to put this series to rest.
B000001DTM|5.0|Released in 1991, U2 stepped off the soapbox, as this record established U2 as a trend-setting pop band. Much of it was created in an unhospitable and depressing environment (Berlin), where Bono and The Edge were looking to &quot;dream it all up again&quot; and Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. sought to keep the sound consistent with its roots.  The result was their second masterpiece and the harbinger for a decade for experimentation.  Here is a song-by-song review:<br />1. &quot;Zoo Station&quot;.  With distorted guitar licks alternating between your two speakers, you realize immediately that this is not the old U2. <br />2. &quot;Even Better Than The Real Thing&quot;.  This fourth single from the record is a well-constructed pop ditty with some of The Edge's best guitar work.<br />3. &quot;One&quot;.  This unforgettable third single, which has been covered by the likes of Johnny Cash and R.E.M., lends itself to many lyrical interpretations, but perhaps it is the subtle guitar work that makes this one of U2's best songs.<br />4. &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;.  Lyrically, it is a conversation between Jesus and Judas; musically, it is a atmospheric rocker.  Although it was not a single, it was included on the soundtrack to the Wim Wenders film of the same name (albeit a different version), it has remained in the U2 live set for the last decade, and it was included on the band's 'The Best of 1990-2000'.<br />5. &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot;.  The chorus is all U2, but the music is somewhat disjointed.  A better version (mostly acoustic and in a lower key) was released as the fifth single from the record.<br />6. &quot;So Cruel&quot;.  This track epitomizes the experimentalism of the record, as Larry Mullen, Jr. lays down his heaviest beats over a piano and strumming guitar in this wonderfully emotional ballad.  Unfortunately, the song never made it into a live performance.<br />7. &quot;The Fly&quot;.  As the first single from the record, it was not only a song, but Bono's character on the Zoo TV tour.  It is safe to say that the sound is rock-industrial, and the lyrics are a series of sayings over a phone call from hell.  Bono once characterized the song as &quot;the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree&quot;.<br />8. &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;.  As the second single and one of their most popular hits, U2 discovered a funky groove in this distinctly nonspiritual (or is it?) pop song.<br />9. &quot;Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot;.  As perhaps the weakest song on the record, this one moseys along and remains an idiosyncratic favorite of some fans for the borrowed line - &quot;A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot;<br />10. &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot;.  This rocking track is musically similar to early U2, although, as with much of the record, the lyrics deal with human relationship matters - in this case, regret and hope.<br />11. &quot;Acrobat&quot;.  As a personal and political rocker, this one is most like a song you would hear their first three records in the early 1980s.  The Edge's helicopter guitar riffs are a high point.<br />12. &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;.  Originally written during the 'Rattle &amp; Hum' era for a female singer, this brooding ballad borrows from the lyrical approach in &quot;The Fly&quot; and was a perfect show closer to the U2 tour.  (HINT:  The live version on the &quot;Stay&quot; single is a must.)
B00005JLF5|4.0|Sure, Dwayne might get mad about my abuse of his line, but we live with danger every day, don't we?<BR>DS9, the strongest of all the Treks, comes out on DVD, in a full season offer. How do you beat that? Well, bring out the rest of the seasons in short order, I say. Still and all, a welcome thing. Thank you, Powers That Be, for finally getting the clue. It only took you... how many years?
B000068TP0|5.0|This is the best music video I've ever seen for any artist. Additionally, as a Shakira fan, I got the same feeling viewing this as I did when I discovered her music for the first time. Her very expressive body language added a new and previously unexperienced dimension to her music. My favorite song on the video is &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda.&quot; It is very different than the version on &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones?&quot; In the version on the video the song explores 3 or 4 different tempos and sometimes even two different tempos at the same time. I may be mistaken, but the audio quality of the DVD sounds better than that on the MTV Unplugged CD. I've watched this many times and still haven't viewed it yet with the English subtitles.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|This is a great film in the 007 series. Although it isn't an &quot;official&quot; Bond film, it's better than &quot;Octupussy&quot; (the only Bond film with Roger Moore that wasn't that great, but was the only chance to see a Bond girl naked.). This is much better. A fitting final performance by Sean Connery in the role that made him famous. Get it and love it! Grade: A+
B000063UR2|5.0|This is an epic film, when the magic was forgotten from the movies, it has all the elements that make this movie an amazing film, create with basics elements of special effects and more acting from the crew. This film particulary make me feel the children inside me and I enjoy a lot this magic adventure, trusting the good guy survive at the end.
B00000K0E5|3.0|Although it has some great action sequences and some fine-looking Bond women, this entry is the worst. I liked it in theaters, but its very dull. Skip this one. &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; are better, Grade: C-
B00005QGAV|4.0|Although Michael Jackson is one of history's greatest entertainers, he, like is sister Janet, benefits by being paired with a brilliant producer. Master musician Quincy Jones worked magic on the singer's landmark albums (&quot;Off the Wall&quot;, the super-platinum and award-winning &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;).<br />In the case of &quot;Dangerous&quot;, Jackson scored big with the songs either co-written or produced by Teddy Riley. The seven selections bearing the &quot;stamp of approval&quot; by Riley make this an essential album to have by &quot;The Gloved One&quot;.<br />Although the disc shows the beginnings of wretched excess by the singer (three of the songs should've been eliminated), it still showcases the entertainer at his best.  Besides the seven (&quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot;, the enigmatic &quot;In the Closet&quot;, &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, the superior &quot;Remember the Time&quot;, &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot;, and the title cut), other highlights include the monster smash &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Will You Be There&quot;.<br />Now, if we could get Jackson to steer away from over-emoting as he does on the sappy &quot;Gone 'Too Soon&quot;, then he might be able to return to his rightful place as the &quot;King of Pop&quot;.<br />He just doesn't need to dangle any more babies over banisters.
B000006MS3|5.0|...1980's that is. Brilliant music all the way through and of course it can only be Kate Bush with such unbeleivable talent. How can you not love super-hyper on 'Sat in your lap' or the sheer genius layout in 'night of the swallow'. It is all very different and enchanting. No song will leave you bored. Listen to this over and over, like I do and enjoy it with a cup of tea in the early morning. I can happily recommend any Kate Bush album to anyone, but this one is definetly the firm favourite. 'Suspended in gaffa' is my favourite song of any person ever.
0060523794|1.0|Little Lou did his &quot;magic&quot; by cutting employee medical care, cutting employee retirement benefits, cutting employee vacation time, and finally... cutting employees! He stopped training and investing in people. If you didn't have current skills, you were fired and someone younger and more naive was hired, for a while... <BR>Ya, what a genius!
B000000W5F|5.0|TATTOO YOU is the best work the STONES put out during the 80's. The band was kicking on all cylinders on this one and by listening to it, you can hear that in the music. Some may say that this was their last great album, while that is open to debate, this album was really a huge hit for them. This album has some killer rock songs that rank up there with their great singles from the 60's. You have here START ME UP, HANG FIRE, LITTLE T&amp;A, NEIGHBOURS, WAITING ON A FRIEND, BLACK LIMOSINE,and SLAVE. These songs just standout and deserve a listen to and I think that the listener will enjoy them. These songs are the best this great album has to offer. The remaining 4 tracks are not bad songs, they have somewhat of a mellowness to them that makes them easy to listen to, but they just lack the fire of the other 7. With that said, this album still gets 5 stars and deserves all the praise that it received. 20+ years after its release, this album still is revelent.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Many of the songs sound the same.  After listening to the CD a few times I found myself saying &quot;didn't I just hear that song?&quot;<br />I would recommend any of the Sade CDs over this one.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I love this CD and I feel that India was definitely robbed at the Grammys.  I think this CD is great from beginning to end and I don't have to skip any of the songs unlike so many CDs that are out today.  My favorite cut has got to be &quot;I Am Ready for Love&quot;  If you haven't already, pick this up and you will not be disappointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Being a &quot;critic&quot; of female vocalists since the age of 3 I have loved them all - Barbara, Whitney, Mariah and Celine but Christina has risen to the challenge and all I can say is MOVE OVER LADIES! The sheer power of this young womans voice is astounding! It comes from her toes! She sings her songs with such feeling that you stop singing with her to listen.  I say the GRAMMY better go to Christina Agulera. Tack 3 is my favorite and so are all the others. You will quickly appreciate this fantastic album.
0064407667|4.0|The ineffable Lemony Snicket has begun chronicling a series of unfortunate events with A Bad Beginning, which, as a first book, is not so bad at all.  The story is swiftly told and cleverly written and the atmosphere created at the novel's start is sustained throughout.  The climax somewhat lacked the cleverness of the majority of the novel but that is a small quibble (a word here that means a nit-picking reader looking for something to criticize to justify his review).  This book will lead this reader to explore the entire series to see if the style of writing or these characters' adventures continue to entertain time and again.  That will be the true test for this good beginning to an interesting series.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love Beauty and the Beast, it is such a great story and the animation is wonderful.  This is my fave Disney movie!! I love the new music number and over all i think this movie rocks!!!
B00005JKZ3|3.0|This movie is solidly mediocre. I really like MIB1, but MIB2 follows the stereotype of a bad sequel. Until I saw the movie, I had not really thought about the fact that no one recommended this movie to me when it came out. Usually a good movie will prompt several people to suggest it. A great move will prompt almost everyone I know to suggest it. Not surprisingly, we even spared the last twenty minutes to watch something more beneficial (a rarity, considering how many movies we watch). When I saw the average rating, I was not all surprised that it was three stars. That is the best that I would give it, as well.
B000063K2W|5.0|What a wonderful film.  I never tire of watching this classic with an all female cast.  And what a cast!  Headed by MGM's reigning queen, Norma Shearer, and her chief rival at the studio, Joan Crawford, the film includes the cream of Hollywood's finest actresses, most of whom were to go onto greater things.  My own personal favourite actress, Rosalind Russell, is a stand out in the cast as the meddlesome Sylvia who gets her just deserts in fabulous comic terms by the film's end.  Roz would go onto to great things in the coming years as this film was a spring board to her becoming the screen's greatest comic actress.  Others in the cast include young Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard who are also excellent.  In fact, every role in the film is cast perfectly.  It's one of those films!  My advice:  if you love film classics, don't miss this one.  It's a riot.  And the DVD has a number of bonus features that only add to the pleasure.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams' score to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another masterpiece from our modern day musical master.  This score shares just enough in common with the score from the first movie so that we feel comfortable that, yes, we have reentered Harry Potter's world.  However, there are some great new themes that are extraordinary.  The track &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; has quickly become my favorite Harry Potter theme and is worth the price of the CD alone.<br />How does the music fit in with the movie?  Very well, thanks.  After all, this is John Williams.  Chamber of Secrets is a darker and more intense movie than the first installment.  And the music reflects this.  The Flying Car, The Spiders, Meeting Aragog, and Dueling the Basilisk are all examples of intense music that synergizes the visual action.  The emotion is all there:  sadness, fear, happiness.  <br />Oh, and don't forget:  at least with the initial release, the CD comes with 6 different cover inserts.  (I got Hagrid).  The regular movie insert is also present behind the collectable inserts.  <br />Overall, this gets my 5 star rating for movie soundtracks.
B000075BFK|4.0|Better Dayz iz a collection of songz that Pac didn't like in 96 and songz that he didn't have time to release. This album iz a slower album, mostly made of ballads, but there are faster songz like Street Fame, When We Ride..., Still Ballin, Military Mindz...If you're a Pac fan definetly buy this album. Pac's rhymez are fantastic, but the final touch made by Death Row iz a little soft, they could have made the album a little faster, anyway...the best songz are Street Fame (true 2Pac), When We Ride On Our Enemies, My Block, Thug'z Mansion, Better Dayz...I heard that a new album iz comin in 2003, can't wait 4 that one!<BR>Once again Tupac Shakur remainz the realest out there.
0375757295|3.0|As a fan of Jane Austen and one who ranks \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among the great literary accomplishments of the millennium, it disappoints me to rate \\"Persuasion\\" as a ho-hum novel. Unfortunately, the book fulfils the expectations of a two-hundred-year-old romance novel from Old England: dull.<br />The book has a strong and compelling intro. Anne Elliot is one of three daughters of widower Sir Walter Elliot, a vain but financially challenged baronet whose daughters have reached marrying age. As a young lady, Anne had a romance with a certain Captain Wentworth, but this relationship breaks up for reasons that are dribbled out over the course of the book, and Wentworth goes off with the Navy for many years. The story line then wanders off in no apparent direction for a couple of hundred pages as we are introduced to other characters and led thru events with unclear purpose or relevance. But Wentworth reappears on the scene and slowly the plot evolves. Austen tries to persuade us to keep reading with mild intrigue over the Elliot estate, conniving cousins, convoluted love triangles, and the ultimate question: will Anne and the Captain reignited their romance?<br />Although Anne Elliot is a strong and likable character, she seems to do little to advance her own cause. Things just seem to happen to her. While Austen's sentence-by-sentence prose is as beautiful and lyrical as ever, she does an insufficient job in the book's middle of persuading contemporary readers, who prefer faster-paced fiction, to brave the huge passages of wordy exposition and press on to the end. Rabid Austen fans, readers of romance novels, and lovers of classic literature will undoubtedly appreciate Persuasion, but I hesitate to recommend it as an introduction to Jane Austen. I'm afraid that if this were her only novel, she'd have been lost to the ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.
B000002UAR|5.0|this is the best Beatles album that i have.  i  started with the beatles because of john lennons crazy ways of doing things but eventually lead to the music.  I was watching the Beatles anthology when it came on channel 7 in '95 and the song the effing got me was &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; which is definitly one of the bests songs EVER recorded specially for 1966! And on the Beatles Anthology the earlier version is slowed but just as HOT!!  The BEatles was doing things musically as well as lyrically in the 60's that no one was doing (perhaps when Led zeppelin and hendrix came on and took music to another effing galaxy!)  But nevertheless as a black man that grew up in Jamaica, Queens The Beatles got me hooked and remain one of several musical influences on me as a musician and screenwriter.  Thanks. ONE.
B000001GK9|5.0|When this set was orgininally released, it was criticized for have a very thin and metallic, almost edgy sound to the strings, for this was a very early digital recording, and among the first of the digital live recordings.  (DG's first digital recording was Karajan's Die Zauberflote recording from 1980, a studio recording.)  Well, the new (relatively) remastering has removed that, making the sound quality infalliable.  So now we can discuss a performance which will come through your speakers to you in pure, clean sound.  (The fact that this was recorded live does not impact the sound quality at all, and the audience is only very rarely heard, if ever.  Rest assured, the closing is not covered in coughs, probably due to the fact that DG had taped the previous day's rehersals just in case they needed them for small patches.)<BR>      Karajan turns in one of the performances of his life here.  A late comer to Mahler, he first started playing (and therefore recording) Mahler in the early 1970s, though he had become acquainted with his music much earlier in life.  The reason he had thus far avoided Mahler was that he felt he didn't have the time or energy for enough rehersals to do him justice.  Well, as you can see from all his Mahler recordings (studio recordings of symphonies number 4, 5, 6, and 9, plus this live recording of the 9th) that he did indeed do him justice.  The performance is extremely well thought out and executed.  Karajan judges all tempos perfectly and balances the orchestra correctly.  It doesn't sound like it is \\"interpreted\\" or exaggerated, it just sounds like Karajan is giving it to you how it is.  He keeps his eye on the long line, the structure, while still maintaining a high level of detail and texture, finding the perfect balance between being a \\"line guy\\" and a \\"chord guy\\".<BR>        There is only one reason why you should hesitate to purchase this recording for even one moment.  That reason is that you are paying for two full-priced discs,with just the 9th symphony on them, for a total of 84 minutes, just barely (by about 3-4 minutes) too long to fit onto one CD.  Karajan's studio recording, however, while definately inferior interpretively (and in analogue, rather than digital, sound, if that makes a difference) is on a two disc two-fer (two discs for the price of one) along with Karajan's recording of Kindertotenlieder and Ruckert Lieder with Christa Ludwig.  I would still go with this version, but if you are on a budget, and you must have Karajan, the alternative is not bad.  If you are on a budget and want a 9th symphony, but don't need Karajan, definately go with Haitink's two-fer coupled with his Das Lied von der Erde, another splendid performance.  Well, whichever set you choose, happy listening!

B00003CX9Q|3.0|In a lot of ways, the two DVD sets that mark the 20th anniversary of the warm-and-fuzzy classic \\"E.T.\\" feel like family albums. Most of the on-the-set footage plays like home movies. The cast clearly considers \\"E.T.\\" one of their own. \\"He was one of the kids,\\" \\"E.T.\\" mom Dee Wallace says. Charming and nostalgic to be sure, but the material probably resonates best with those connected to the production.<br />Universal Home Video has released \\"E.T.\\" in two handsome sets, marking the film's debut on DVD. (Some of the material appeared on laserdisc.) Both have the heft of an event release, with fine art direction on the packages, discs and menus. Audio and video have been spit-polished; the list of extras seems mighty enough. Clearly, the money was spent.<br />Still, it all feels a bit thin. Put simply, the sets are not in the same league with well-organized, highly informative titles like \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" Spielberg's own \\"A.I.\\" or \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\"<br />At times, the extras for \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" play like \\"E.T.\\" the celebrity news show. Spielberg and his actors stay in pure promotion mode as they reminisce. The populist approach should suit fans looking to catch up with the \\"E.T.\\" stars, but it probably won't sit well with those seeking insight into one of the last century's most successful movies.<br />Both sets feature the original theatrical version of \\"E.T.\\" and the updated director's cut that was released to cinemas in March. Universal says Spielberg gave in to consumer demand at the last minute, agreeing to include the original film on the smaller set. This may explain some of the DVD sets' problems with clunky navigation and skimpy direct access of extras. Both sets include a second unspooling of the new film as it was accompanied live by John Williams' orchestra.<br />The \\"Limited Collector's Edition\\" has a half-hour version of the new making-of docu \\"The Evolution and Creation of E.T.\\" that runs almost an hour on the larger set. Also missing is the larger set's thoughtful documentary on John Williams, who won an Oscar for his \\"E.T.\\" score. These cuts removed some of the more informative material, making the full box set the necessary (and more costly) acquisition for those with a serious interest in the film. Both sets are to be discontinued at the end of the year, returning \\"E.T.\\" to the suspended animation of \\"video moratorium.\\"<br />\\"The Ultimate Gift Boxed Set\\" adds a remastered CD soundtrack, the colorful hardcover book \\"E.T. From Concept to Classic\\" (which threads Melissa Mathison's script around some decent feature material) and a \\"collectible senitype\\" (reproduction of a film frame). A certificate of authenticity makes it all official. The review copy's box suffered significant tearing at the corners not long after it was removed from the shrinkwrap. The smaller package is quite sturdy.<br />The new cut of \\"E.T.\\" looks fine, much as it did during its theatrical run last spring. Image quality has its highs and a few lows, but this appears to be the best possible rendering of \\"E.T.\\" The older film looks so-so, with night scenes on the muddy side.<br />The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound strong for the most part, providing sufficient vistas for John Williams' sweeping score. The DTS provides more depth and bottom than the Dolby, but the difference won't be dramatic on most systems. In an oddity, the original \\"E.T.\\" on the two-disc edition has DTS encoding, but not on the more extensive set (this is not reflected on the packaging). Universal says this was a disc-space issue. No matter -- the old sound can't touch the new sound regardless of how it's processed. Limited surround effects on the updated film won't test the outer limits of many systems: It all sounds kind of Pro Logic, probably a creative decision.<br />Buyers of the larger set get a breakdown of scenes that were changed or added, but you have to go deep into the making-of to find the comparisons. (Users should be able to access features like these quickly via menus).res like these quickly via menus).

The older disc had its charms in a Good Guys kind of way - especially the cartoon-like Technicolor images on the fantasy dance sequences -- but suffered from major speckling and flatness. The new version, from restored elements, removes virtually all signs of wear and delivers the ever-changing color schemes with authority.<br />Viewers don't have to wait long to see the upgrades. Check out the shot of the aging fan at 2:14 and of star Gene Kelly at 9:35: Flesh tones look perfect and contrasts are rock solid; just amazing for a film made in 1951. Or the men's tuxedos and white shirts not long after that. Further proof: take a look at the Vixen's stockings in chapter 30 -- there's plenty of detail over the vast geography of Cyd Charisse's legs.<br />As with the older DVD, the film comes full screen (1.33:1). The remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital sounds fine, conservative in its surround mix -- it's basically all up front. Viewers may want to see if they prefer the original mono track.<br />Two contrasting documentaries anchor the extras.<br />\\"Musicals, Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM,\\" from 1998, tells the story of the legendary musicals maker and his \\"untouchable\\" stable of song and dance talent.

Freed, says Charisse, \\"changed the look of musicals -- suddenly we're not old-fashioned looking any more.\\" Stanley Donen, the co-director with Kelly of \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" says of Freed: \\"He wanted to do something quite remarkable. He didn't approach it as if he were going to blow up the system.\\" \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" came somewhat near the end of Freed's remarkable career and is one of the best expressions of his uplifting, upbeat aesthetic.<br />The new \\"What a Glorious Feeling\\" making-of featurette has a nice breezy tone, but is far less ambitious than the Freed docu. It trots out some fun trivia: Kelly's iconic \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" solo wasn't in the original script; Judy Holliday suddenly became too famous for the squeaky actress part then memorably played by Jean Hagen; Oscar Levant had the Donald O'Connell role but couldn't handle the dance parts.

6303965415|5.0|First, I have to confess I only read half the book so can only speak to that part of the adaptation.  But I can attest that part is a very faithful to the book, not just the storyline but also Austen's humor.  The film is well casted, the costumes and sets look authentic, the scenery around the English countryside is idyllic - all in all, it's a splendid film to behold.  <br />The film also tempted me to finish the book, but so far I'm resisting.  I'm on a Dickens kick right now and compared to him, dainty Jane just doesn't quite cut it.  I started &quot;Persuasion&quot; at the same time as &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, thinking I would read them at the same time.  But Dickens won out.  I never picked up Jane again after the first 200 pages (of Dickens).
B00006RU5B|5.0|Usually, when a band comes together composed of former greats, the result is a mangled mess of sound that does not compare to the old bands individually, and they spiral into mediocrity.  This is not the case with Audioslave, whose sound is both Soundgarden and RATM, yet neither of the two.  It is classice Rage rythym and beats and Soundgarden screams, yet is completely original.  Hopefully, this one is here to stay.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just have to say that I bought this album a couple weeks after it came out way back in February and instantly became one of my favorite CD's. The strange thing is that I usually listen to rap and never anything this mellow. I don't know why I like this CD, but even now, 10 months later, this album is still my favorite.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; after I heard the title song on Smallville. This is an AMAZING CD. It's &quot;soaking-in-a-hot-tub-with-candles-lit&quot; music, it's baby-makin music, it's get-in-the-mood-music, it's chill-and-put-your-feet-up-after-a-long-hard-day music. It's really anything that you want it to be if you need to relax for any reason. BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it!
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you you enjoy severe, inbred, double-first cousin mountain bluegrass music, this cd is perfect for you. You also will need to have an appreciation for the sounds of a cat fight, fingernails down a chalkboard and have had a relative be an extra in 'Deliverance'. Happy listening
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am a huge RATM fan and this album is as good if not better than rage. I was very impressed with the way Cornell sounded with the band. The guitar riffs are top notch. This band will be huge. Can't wait for the tour.
B000066NW0|3.0|First off, before I say what's wrong with it, I really like this album. It's on my car stereo most of the time. However, after reading loads of reviews that slate it, I feel like I should protect it! It makes a nice change to have this kind of music sung by an angry girl instead of a group of angry boys. Means I can sing along without having to growl the low bits. Almost every song is catchy and sing-along-able and her voice is definitely not without it's merits. Many people put down Lavigne saying she's trying to be Alanis Morrissette or Tori Amos. Listening to the lyrics and reading interviews with her, I honestly think she's just being herself and has probably been influenced by said performers: doesn't mean she's trying to be them. Although every song is similar, it makes her album something that can be enjoyed as background music as well as foreground music. As for her sk8r image, whether or not it's real is not something to be ranted about. After all, how many other performers out there are genuinely dressed how they'd dress if they weren't famous? Would Kylie walk around town in those ridiculously small dresses? I think not. <BR>  Overall, Lavigne's music is exactly what it says on the box: girly pop-rock. If you don't like it, don't buy it!! If you do like it, it's a worthy addition to your CD collection.

B00007E8V4|4.0|I think System's philosophy is quite shrewd.  Get out as much political music as you can, as fast as you can--with enough grooves and hooks to keep 'em coming back.  One powerful song may not do as much good as three albums filled with common rants.<br />If you listen to System you get mad at the system.  Get people listening to System, buying new System, and minds will change from repetition and continual exposure to radical ideas.  One NPR Alternative Radio lecture may make your blood boil... five may get you writing letters and checks... ten may make you change political parties.  SOAD keeps cranking them out, too, across Radio Purchased America.<br />Will this strategy work?  Let's listen to what's playing at the next WTO anarchist fair.
0446608955|4.0|&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was an ok book. The story plot was good but i think it could have been more discriptive. The story was nice and i would recomend it if you like romantic books and you have a good imagination. Nicholas Sparks is a good writer but i think if this book had given more detail that the book would be much better.  But over all the book was good.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce did it. In my opinion, he wrote the only album that deals with the emotions surrounding 9/11 that is worth listening to. The album is moving. It's thoughtful. Provocative. And yet, tons of fun with songs like &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;Skin to Skin.&quot; Best Bruce ever.
6305662355|5.0|The best movie that Bruce Lee every made, and even includes scenes that were cut from the original when the movie was first shown. Is still a classic in the martial arts realm, but is a good movie for anybody to watch. <BR>Has a good plot, action, and good writing that would have made a hit in the movie theatres today. <BR>With your purchase, you will receive a CD with music tracks from the movie, the DVD movie itself, with trailers and a short interview with Linda Lee Cadwell, his wife, some posters from the movie, and a movie still from the movie itself in a special frame.<BR>Is a great gift for the martial arts fan.
B000002UAU|5.0|... can anyone trule give this CD anything less than 5 stars? It's pure Beatles, pure genius, pure perfection.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've always liked Christina Aguilera. Even when she and Britney were chart rivals and the bubble gum pop trend was at it's full peak, I think there was always an indication that Christina's talent would just grow, while the others (Backstreet/N'Sync/Britney) would eventually fade. Stripped proves that Christina is an artist who strives on creativity and quality. The songs are so diverse and complete. Loving Me 4 Me is so beautiful, and the vibe is so dope. I was also surprised when I found out that ?uestlove from the Roots plays drums for that track. Cruz reminds me of the type of song an 80's hair band would sing, but Christina's voice gives it a beautiful touch. I also love Impossible, Make Over, and Get Mine, Get Yours. I would recommend this album to anyone. I know people who dislike Christina, but absolutly love the album. It's truly one of the best to come out of the pop world this year.
B00006AVRK|5.0|These discs are worth the price. You 'll get the full flavor of  P.G. Wodehouse's great books by watching these wonderful stories again and again. With the bumbling dim witted Wooster and his quick witted valet Jeeves they go from one pratfall to another. <BR>Each story is full of great characters and fun from beginning to end. So join Barmey, Stinker Pinker, and Tuppy as they, along with Balmey and Stiffy, help poor Berty with the problems of life. Pip Pip and Cherrio.
6305428352|1.0|I do not like this movie.  It is stupid, sappy, and predictible.  The main character is a jerk.  He is ugly.  I dislike his glasses.  He almost cheats on his very faithful and beautiful wife with a random pretty student.  That is just wrong.  He never writes music, ignores his son, and hates you in particular.  You should not see this movie.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you angry inside.  I am glad he lost his job.  I would've made him lose more than that, the maniac.  Poor son.  He should strike off and do his own movie about his evil childhood with a negligent father.  Okay.  I'm done.
0151008116|2.0|After winning the Booker prize this year, this book has been generating lots of press here, and in Mongolia. While I enjoyed chapter 3, the rest of the chapters were not of the quality I've come to expect from good ole' Yam. <br />The story begins in a kind of space age Noah's Ark, with a zany host of characters from across the galaxy. After nearly being destroyed by an asteroid, the Ark crashes on a nearby planet. The rest of the story follows a family of Zarks and a family of Bopahs, as they try to survive on the formidable ice world they crashed on. In the end, the story is about redemption, as the youngest Zark learns to love young Christoph Popah. <br />I spent a weekend reading the book, and while I was entertained, it certainly wasn't what I expected from a Booker prize winner. Better luck next time Yam.

B00005Y1TL|5.0|Allow me to introduce you to Richard D. James (alias Aphex Twin, AFX, and a slew of other inscrutable pseudonyms), a charming bon vivant from Cornwall who is known today for his delightfully blithe eccentricity and iconoclasm. Before he played at clubs using sandpaper on the turntables instead of records, however, and before that hilariously bizarre &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; video, he made Selected Ambient Works 85-92, and by doing so basically singlehandedly created contemporary electronica.<br />I have no easy explanation for why Selected Ambient Works is as good as it is. Here's what I've got it down to: this music is possessed of a remarkable spontaneity and unpretentiousness. The best talents always made their work seem like play, like it came effortlessly to them, without taking themselves seriously. The songs on this album are like that. They are marvelous in their simplicity. It's as if Aphex Twin sat himself down and peeled off great song after great song with complete abandon. It's the work of someone who simply loved making sounds - in fact, you can tell when you're at a sound AFX liked particularly, since he tends to linger on his favourites and extend their playing time. That's not a flaw. The sounds are so good that you'll want to linger on them as well.<br />On this album, Aphex managed to take many a cliche of electronic music and give them all a completely original, unworldly quality. Most of the songs are built around groovy, but more or less conventional dance beats; however, they are bathed in soft feedback and melodies of unearthly beauty. The end result - the waltz-like &quot;Xtal,&quot; the exultant &quot;Pulsewidth,&quot; the eerie &quot;Hedphelym,&quot; the blissfully wincing &quot;Ageispolis,&quot; the flight above- and underground of &quot;Green Calx,&quot; and so on, and so on, and so on. Electronica is often accused of being emotionless, and more often than not rightly so, but Selected Ambient Works is anything but that. This is beautifully emotional music; it's the music your subconscious plays in your sleep. It's music that for all its simplicity has a richer vocabulary than language.<br />I find myself at a loss for words. I don't want to use this as an opportunity to practice my adjectives; I only want to get you to purchase this record. Aphex Twin's achievement was aped by many much-touted &quot;electronic wizards,&quot; most of whom fancy themselves musical geniuses because they can slap together a beat and a bassline on their computer in their parents' basement, but of course bettered by none of them. James himself never did (though he came close in some later songs such as &quot;On&quot;). Then again, it might not even be possible.
B000005HN6|5.0|Opeth has never even produced a \\"worst album\\" if you wanna be purist and simple about it.  It's very apparent, however, that in this and their 2nd, \\"Morningrise,\\" they didn't concentrate on actual song structure.  Granted, that's a very purist comment in it's own right, but this album easily earned 5 stars because of mikael and peter's mastery at the guitar.  I really think they just sat down and bounced riffs off of one another, mixing it together into some gorgeous music.  What i mean by their lack of song structure is that this album more or less plays like an ambience, you don't necessarily pay attention to each \\"song\\" as much, but it does anything but bore or disinterest you.  \\"My Arms Your Hearse\\" (their 3rd) surprised everyone, i'm sure.  I wasn't an opeth fan at the time of its release, but im sure it impressed everyone in the fact that they proved that they were capable of constructing beautiful music.  Then came \\"Still Life,\\" which [surprised]all opeth fans... , simply because everything about it (except for that ending to \\"serenity painted death\\") showed songwriting mastery.  Then \\"Blackwater Park\\" decreed that anyone who wasnt mikael akerfeldt, peter lindgren, martin lopez or martin mendez was considered a simple inferior human being and not the gods that produced such an opus, to attempt to prove otherwise would be treading very dangerous ground.
B000002B30|5.0|Great collection spawning from Springsteen's early rock (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands) to his cheesy pop hits (Dancing in the Dark, Hungry Heart), his story ballads (The River, Atlantic City), rock anthems (Born in the U.S.A., Glory Days), and his newer rock hits (Human Touch, Better Days).  At the end he throws in soundtrack hit \\"Streets of Philadephia\\" and some new tracks.<br />Overall the collection is excellent; it shines from the \\"Born to Run\\" album through \\"Born in the U.S.A\\" album and then the song quality drops a little for the rest of the album.  But every songwriter has a \\"golden period\\" and sooner or later will decline.  Still, even on later tracks such as \\"Murder Incorporated\\" and \\"This Hard Land,\\" his ferocious singing and deep lyrics are impressive.  My one qualm is not including the haunting ballad \\"I'm on Fire.\\"
B00006SFBD|4.0|I'm gonna come out and say it, damnit, i was somewhat disappointed in \\"deliverance,\\" it's like they tried too hard.  I remember the sticker on it said \\"Over 60 minutes of new music by opeth!\\"  and all i could think was \\"Ohhh, this is trouble.\\"  So what happens?  the last 3-4 minutes is silence then some vocal excerpts from \\"Master's Apprentices\\" REVERSED...is it just me, or is mikael getting fed up with writing music?  (which, he has admitted to in some interviews after they were finished recording \\"damnation\\")  I hope \\"damnation\\" will be better, because if it isn't, i'll be deeply troubled and depressed and realize that the band i've been hailing as the greatest to ever pick up instruments and decide to write music might actually be losing their touch.<BR>Aside from all this, the album still wreaks of the band's uncanny ability to make really catchy music, and often found myself humming various portions of the album to myself while i was occupied with something else, which is quite typical of opeth.  There's no doubt that they experimented a little on this one, such as the strange shifting of time signatures in the title track, which is actually one of those catchy ones that stick with you for a good week if not longer.  The guitaring is typical of opeth:  unprecedented.  The vocaling is pretty cool, with a death metal approach in many segments.  Speaking of a death metal approach, who the hell saw \\"Master's Apprentices\\" coming?  I've never heard any opeth song like it, it opens like some classic morbid angel song with the low-tuned percussive chords, and the double-bass banging away in the background.  It's still opeth though, and it's still damn good music by today's standards, but i was still expecting something at least almost as good as BWP, although i think by human standards that's probably impossible.  BWP simply moved me much more, \\"deliverance\\" just sounds like something i can throw into the cd player when i've already listened to everything else.
0345440900|4.0|We have a &quot;touchy&quot; or &quot;high-need&quot; baby and this book was a life saver. A flexible predictable routine was exactly what our baby needed. This book shows you how to read your baby's cues so you can give him/her exactly what he/she wants. When I read the book initially when my son was 4 weeks old, I was shocked how cold the systems sounded so I only used the ideas I liked from this book. Now I look back (he is 10 weeks old), I understand that it's not &quot;cold&quot; but pure common-sense. I don't recommend using her methods until your baby is 4-6 weeks old. The Baby Book's methods (like co-sleeping and using the sling) are a much better approach for under 6 weeks old. I use both Dr. Sears and Hoggs methods together for a wonderful combo!
B0000584V3|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time and articulate on every portion of every song, if you want a short review, here it is.  Anyone who has ears will be completely blown away by this masterpiece.  This is the one that got me into opeth, and damnit, if i didn't get that really weird feeling like the first time i heard \\"Master of Puppets\\" when i was 8, and have the effect cubed in this one, i'll be DAMNED.  Most people will raise their eyebrow after hearing the singing, but hey...YOU try doing the signature black metal growl...here, have a glass of water, i know it tickles, just get used to the fact that they use this style of singing to invoke certain moods in their passionate lyrics, and you will soon see the talent that lies in this genre.  If Mikael and Peter aren't the gods of songwriting and guitar architecture, then please inform me of my misleading and guide me to the light.  This is the best recorded album of all time.  Period.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I special ordered this VHS tape before it even hit the regular market place and was well pleased with the purchase. The acting was excellent and the costuming great.

B0000087QO|5.0|Blondie gave new credibility to pop music in the late 1970's. Soon outgrowing their punk roots, they created first the brilliant Plastic Letters in 1977, then this masterpiece the next year. At least four chart hits were lifted from this album, but there could've been more. Picture This and Sunday Girl are evocative numbers with an undertone of sadness, somewhat in a 60's vein, while Heart Of Glass is of course the hypnotic megaselling popdisco hit, later covered by The Associates among others. My other favorites include the experimental and moving Fade Away And Radiate (Was this perhaps influenced by Bowie?) and I'm Gonna Love You Too, a happily rolling powerpop tune. Tracks like Pretty Baby, 11:59 and Just Go Away are catchy and memorable too and could also have been hits. I'm not particularly fond of Hanging On The Telephone and the rest, but they also have plenty of melody and excitement. Blondie's pop displays wit and intelligence in the music, making wry comments on love and life. Some music journalist once claimed: \\"Rocks gets stale, but pop rots.\\" Blondie proves him wrong, very wrong. This music has a timeless appeal, and today still its intelligence enhances the lasting pleasure it gives me.
0316666343|4.0|Ms. Sebold obviously knows rape.  In the very first chapter she kills off her main character with a chillingly familiar man whose past is blurred with abuse and ominously lifeless memories.  <BR>Heaven could have been written better, since obviously she knew exactly where to come from in other aspects.  I remember reading this book and not being able to put it down-- I'd read in class, between class, at lunch, in the car ride home, and att through the night until I had it finished: unless, of course, I hit a spot in the book that colored me wrong and I had to pause in order to calm down.  My imagination often runs wild, you see. <BR>Anyways, this book struck me hard--  I have had to deal with healing from disasters as such; I've have do deal with a crumbling family out of my grasp.  This book hit the soft spot-- and clung there until far after I closed the back flap.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I heard about this series on HBO but never paid any attention. I loved Saving Private Ryan so I thought I'd give this one a go.<br />It recently became available for rent on DVD and I must say this is the best series I've ever seen. I have an afinity for WWII stuff but Band of Brothers is top-notch.<br />From the start, Band of Brothers doesn't let up, the action scenes are amazing and researched. The actors are well chosen (with the exception of David Schwimmer) especially Frank who plays Bill Guarnere, his accent and looks are spot on to Wild Bill! and Dale Dye as the battalion commander.<br />The documentary is worth watching alone. To see and hear the real survivors talk about their ordeal is a trip in time. It actually brought tears to my eyes. I have a newfound respect for the people who fought for our freedom. Lest we forget.

B000002KE2|5.0|_Black Sabbath Vol. 4_ was the first album where classic sludge-rockers Black Sabbath (Ozzy Osbourne-vocals, Bill Ward-drums, Geezer Butler-bass and Toni Iommi-guitar) started experimenting - which possibly foreshadowed what would be more emphasized on the following album, _Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath_. I just want to make a clarification before I move on: Black Sabbath's music is not about satanism or devil worshipping - it's subject matter is mainly about the harsh realities of life (i.e., crime, war, drugs, mental illness and more), which is rather \\"dark\\". Moving onto the tracks:<br />The album opens with \\"Wheels Of Confusion/The Straightener\\", which is a sludgy/heavy powerhouse. This is arguably the heaviest on the album. The lyrics are reflective and sad. \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\" is a r&b-rocker with groove. \\"Changes\\" is a beautiful piano-based ballad. The combination of Ozzy Osbourne's emotive vocals and the sad orchestral backdrops make this a somewhat painful track to listen to at times. \\"FX\\" is a short experiment featuring eerie guitar feedback from Toni Iommi. \\"Supernaut\\" (to me) proves that music is a transcendent force without limits or boundaries. The mix of boogie, classic psychedelic r&b and metal, shows that unlikely combinations  can work - which almost makes it seem like it was never \\"unlikely\\" to begin with. \\"Snowblind\\" is a slow heavy rocker. Tony Iommi does some of his best soloing on this track. The end features some orchestral backdrops (possibly from synthesizers). \\"Cornucopia\\" is probably the most ominous sounding on here (check out the opening section). The dark lyrics contribute to this aspect as well. \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" is the beautiful and evocative acoustic guitar instrumental. If anyone were to listen to this calm, sedate and airy track (without knowledge of it being Sabbath), you wouldn't guess that this was the same band known for their dark and sludgy output - that's talent. \\"St. Vitus' Dance\\" is an upbeat, summery and \\"happy\\" sounding rock track - at least on a musical (excluding lyrics) level. \\"Under The Sun/Everyday Comes And Goes\\" sounds the most \\"Sabbath-esque\\" on here. The beginning is heavy and ominous. It then segues into a straightforward heavy rocker. The lyrics are deep, thought-provoking and rebellious. They address such issues as religion, personal beliefs and violence.<br />In short, _Black Sabbath Vol. 4_ is a classic metal album, which deserves to be owned by diehards, as well as those interested in Black Sabbath, or the roots of heavy metal. This would serve as a good introduction, as it features a well-crafted balance between heaviness and mild experimentation.ack - at least on a musical (excluding lyrics) level. \\"Under The Sun/Everyday Comes And Goes\\" sounds the most \\"Sabbath-esque\\" on here.

B00005R23Z|4.0|I had heard good things about Gattaca but I finally rented it only after I had exhausted all other possibilities.  I shudder to think of all the flacid films I sat through when I could have been watching this excellent movie.  The cast is impressive, the story is engaging, and the music, photography and settings combine to produce an atmosphere that makes this a beautifully-crafted, visual yet cerebral film.<br />Dealing as it does with eugenics, \\"Gattca\\" attempts to reach you at the cellular, nay, molecular level.  Not to put too fine a point on it, writer/director Andrew Niccol(The Truman Show) infuses the film with metaphors of reproduction and genetics, not the least of which being the title itself (refering to a fictitious government space program, \\"Gattaca\\" is nevertheless unmistakeable as an acronym for a sequence of DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine, cytosine).  There is a particularly poignant scene in which a double helix, in the guise of a spiral staircase, presents an imposing obstacle, and at various times individuals themselves become metaphors for spermatocytes (in swim races and while rushing off in a space ship to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, itself a metaphor for an oocyte).<br />As intelligent as it is though, the film is an artistic exposition of themes, not a scholarly dissertation on a very complex set of issues. It would be unfair therefore to complain that the film doesn't do justice to the weighty issues it presents.<br />The score by Michael Nyman (The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The Piano) provides an aural texture that compliments the visuals in a remarkable way, rather like a down-to-earth \\"Blade Runner.\\"  In fact, I would describe the film as part Philip K. Dick, part Aldous Huxley as in \\"Blade Runner cum Brave New World.\\"  One of the best and most timely dystopian films out there.

B000006NPY|4.0|An album that I'd bought, listened to once or twice, and then put back on the shelf, I recently gave \\"Adore\\" a second listen. Overall, its a dark album, mostly mellow tracks, but a few satisfying grinding songs similar to what they put on the \\"Lost Highway\\" Soundtrack. Anywho, some of the highlighted songs are:<br /><br />*Ava Adore* This was the only song that made it to the radio if I remember. Biting, crisp, and very danceable. Very nice at loud volumes.<br /><br />*Appels + Oranjes* Driving, rolling beat, very good for car rides. A \\"what if\\" song, that has that Pumpkin's melancholy tinge, but the pace of the song keeps it upbeat and hopeful. Nice techno mix layered in the background.<br /><br />*Pug* The beginning of the song sounds like something slow and sultry that you might hear at a club. But after the first few strains, it dives into a summery shoegazer kind of pop, and there after blinks back and forth between the two styles so smoothly that you don't even notice it by the end of the song.<br /><br />*Annie Dog* Is memorable, if only because it sounds a lot like something that Ben Folds Five would put out. Real quiet and contemplative.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album is soooo good. There is something for everyone. Every song on here is good. My top three are 'can't hold us dow' which features Lil' Kim, it is a song about double standards and how women can't get away with anything men can. Secondly, 'Get mine, Get Yours' is another favourite, its so catchy u wont want to turn it off. Thridly, 'Beautiful' Which is her next single, it is a ballad which gives a positive message to young girls (unlike 'Dirrty'). I talks about how people should not let other people put them down and that they're beautiful no matter what they say. On most CD's u will want to skip a few songs, but not on this one. Theirs rock, pop, rnb and the sobbing ballads such as 'Im ok' which is very personal as it refers to her younger years when things weren't right at home between her parents. Overall i give it 4 stars. I definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00005JL2O|2.0|Granted, there were some funny parts to this movie, it pales in comparison to the second.  &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; was absolutely current and up to date with pop culture, which is the main basis of the Austin Power's franchise.  However, the third is trite and old and GoldMember is just plain disgusting.  Knowels was suprisingly good and the DVD was great with loads of extras.
B00007E8V4|5.0|First of all if you think Toxicity is System's first album your worn and your stupid and obviously not a System fan.This album is GREAT.ANd for those of you Whining about Johnny not being on the album its becasue it was RELEASED and is not a Bside or Outtake.It was released in Europe on the toxicity single. So for those pppl here who cant get outside systems radio songs nad complain that the first album is too hard then this album is not for you at all.This album is great and is up there with the Selftitled album(my fave) and if your a huge fan of SOAD then u probably already have it.Now for you toxicity people,dont get me wrong,toxicity is a great album,but its not the self titled one.So for those of you who like hard fast catchy great different metal this albumis just for you.And if you thin this is \\"numetal\\" then your dumb. Its not.These guys are compltetly ORINGINAL and all the songs are.Everyone should ahve this album.thanx!
B00007BHOE|5.0|Well... I've been a maggot (slipknot fan) for many years and personally out of all their dvds that have been released.. I think this is one of the best. This one is definantly one to add to ur music dvd collection and if u dont think so, you should have a friend drive you to the hospital for a checkup right now.. cuz there is something definantly wrong with you and it should be checked immediatly.. well that's all I gotta say so im out, stay SiC.
B000068IEU|4.0|I saw this movie initially at a drive in when it was initially released. I have rarely been so profoundly disturbed by a film as by this one. The bottom line is that the &quot;bad guys&quot; are utterly pedestrian. The setting is as mundane as setings get. The crime is set-up by the film and carried out in such a way that it is very clearly possible. There are no heroes in the end. The girls don't get away, and the end is hopeless as ends so often are. The least believeable part of the film is the retribution exacted by the parents. <BR>See the film, but expect to be bothered by it.
6300267881|5.0|This IS THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! Alot scarier than those looser films like Halloween, The Shining, Silence of the Lambs, The Changeling, The Ring, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen. Those movies are just child's play compared to this. I'd recommedn watching it alone in the dark for the ultimate experience, and be warned this is the real deal. SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! Don't let anyone tell you differently, because they'll be lying through there teeth.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Reject songs??....No Way! I think this cd is better than the first, maybe not as good as the big hit Toxicity, but a MUST HAVE for all SOAD fans. It has the usual loud and heavy songs, but this time they even throw in some acoustic in one of the better songs \\"roulette\\". I recommend this to all system fans. I hoped this helped.
B000002KCF|5.0|A friend introduced me to this album when it was first issued and I've been a Michael Franks fan through thick and thin ever since. His appearance on the jazz scene was a welcome change from the jazz-fusion and disco that was in vogue at the time. Looking back over Franks' successful career, this auspicious debut propelled him toward the pantheon of great jazz musicians in which he resides today..<BR>Now, my musical tastes are pretty eclectic. I listen to lots of music and I own lots of music, and I can tell you that Michael Franks is one of the most literate, articulate song stylists on the musical scene, and that goes for any genre. But if you are already a Franks fan you know that.<BR>Sure, Franks' lyrics are sometimes cringingly cute and playful, witness Eggplant and Popsicle Toes. But they are nearly always clever.<BR>I prefer his more wistful and romantic songs. Art of Tea offers a good sampling of both types. To me, Nightmoves and Mr Blue are a couple of the finest songs written by anyone at any time.<BR>On Art of Tea, producer Tommy LiPuma brought in a great team of session musicians like Joe Sample and Larry Carlton to work with Franks. The result was a blockbuster album with an upper-crust appeal which established him firmly as a sophisticated writer and jazz vocalist.
1558908498|4.0|So this is definately not the best scream film. Obviously Scream 1 is the bets of the three. This one is actually a pretty damn good sequel until you get to the end. The ending pretty much ruins the movie as far as I'm concerned ... but i guess it wont be fair to say a movie [stinks] if all but 10 minutes of it is pretty good.<br />Its definately better than a lot of the Scream clone movies that have come out since Scream first showed up.
6301967992|3.0|MY RATING- 7.4<br />It's quite a bizarre mov, but after all what isn't from Polanski? <BR>It's about two vampire killers who aren't  much fearless, and they go after the trail of the vampires castle and his owner, a kind of Draculish noble count. <BR>Attention that this mov introduced the idea of homossexuality between vampires.<BR>Polanski seems having a great time directing and acting in this film, with a horror subject that he uses a lot.  I also loved the older master. <BR>There are some funny chases in the castle, but my personal fave is the ultra funny ball sequence. <BR>The redhaired girl is Sharon Tate, the poor girl who was Polanski's wife and was slaughtered by Charles Manson family in her Beverly Hills home in 1969.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is the year's best cd.  It is on my top 5 list.  Every couple of years I get a cd that I just play over and over, and this is one of those!  John Mayer is perfect.
B000063TNH|3.0|MY RATING- 6.6<br />A tough and accurate view of the drug business between the great lords, who have benefits with the misery of drugs. <BR>A great performance from Michael Douglas and Amy Irving as his wife. My personal fave is Catherine Zeta-Jones who is much more than a beautiful woman here, she's a strong-willed woman who tries to take his husband (who is guilty) out of the prison. <BR>We are treated with different points of view, by loving Douglas' ideals yet we root a little for the efforts of Zeta-Jones, knowing his husband is a real drug lord. <BR>I also loved that division (maybe a racist touch!) between black and white for drug dealing parts and color to what seems our nice world.<BR>Not a great mov, by any means, but see it if you can.
B000053VAF|5.0|unlike many dvds this contained outtakes and extended scenes that were actually worth watching.  Give yourself some time though, there are a LOT of extras,and it takes a while to watch 'em all
B000002GKT|5.0|If you only have one Humble Pie album, make sure it's this one! If you only have room for two Pie albums, get this one and Rock On. Live at the Whiskey gets third, primarily on the strength of their amazing \\"For Your Love\\" cover. On the Fillmore East, Marriott sometimes sounds like he swallowed the harmonica, and Frampton does things to his guitar that are illegal in most states! Definitely one of the top-10 live rock albums of all time, this is a great introduction to a band that could've, and should've, been much bigger than the way things worked out. 23 min. of Gilded Splinters alone is worth the price! If you like Zepp, if you like Floyd, Tull or the Allmans, give this a spin -- you won't be sorry!
B00005JLF5|5.0|Out of all the shows produced based on Gene's original Star Trek, Deep Space Nine would have to be the best one.  The fact that it is based on a permanent space station provides it with at stable and constant story and characters.  Each episode is connected with the previous and the next.  Recurring characters and story lines.  The whole Dominion War that covers 5 seasons is what really made the series awesome.  The whole series leading up to the Dominion War and the eventual defeat of the Dominion was great.  Overall you feel a great sense of family because you get to really see the characters evolve and develop more than any series.  This is definately a must buy.  I know I will be the first to get a copy of it.<br />Lifetime Star Trek Fan and <br />P.S.<BR>         The next movie needs to be a Deep Space Nine movie.<BR>         Long Live DS9
B000000W6R|5.0|Picese is a great album featuring the songs that did not make it on siamese. I would highly recommend this album, it gives you a unique look at the pumpkins while still fitting in with the Siamese Dream Motif. SOme great songs are (Just to name a few) Frail and bedazzled, a rock song and Spaced, an obscure song featuring steel or slide guitar.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Not as intense songs tend to get better as the album progresses. <br />There's plenty of the characteristic angular riffology one would expect from guitar master Tom Morello. He doesn't unleash as many weird sounds and pyrotechnics as he has on previous RATM albums, although his guitar ocassionally sounds uncannily like a synthisiser. Unfortunately Chris Cornell's voice sounds strained in a few places, but overall his vocal contributions are solid. According to the credits he doesn't play any guitar. That's too bad because he's an excellent guitarist who could've added a lot of color to this album. We might've gotten some interesting guitar interplay. Maybe he felt like he would've stepped on Morello's toes, I don't know. Morello certainly handles the guitar duties capably. Also Cornell should grow out that goofy haircut, but that's not important.<br />Another insignificant aside: They should have gotten a better album cover. This one looks like a latter-day Cranberries cover - fake and stupid. <br />This might not entirely please all of their old fans, but I like it and I do recommend AUDIOSLAVE.
B000075BFK|5.0|If you're a real thug and truly like Makaveli then you'll love ghetto star this is done with the original track I heard in L.A. in 96' and it's still banging, overall the album is a very good album way better than Until the end of time, though I disagree with Nas on the album.
B000007WNN|5.0|When this album came out I was horrified. At the time I was a big fan of LOVE which was much more \\"alternative\\" and psychedelic rock. This album sounded like all the meat-head metal bands that I hated. Just plain old uninteresting, unchallenging, straight-up rock n' roll. I shunned it for a year or so until someone left a tape of it in my car. I ended up listening to it all the time. Why? For the very reasons I initially hated it. There's nothing to think about - it just rocks. Rocks your pants off! I still laugh when I hear \\"Peace Dog,\\" but I'm jamming out at the same time. \\"Wid Flower,\\" \\"Lil Devil,\\" etc. are very enjoyable, mindless rocking out. Only the \\"Born To Be Wild\\" cover is unremarkable, but not bad either. I particularly love \\"Memphis Hip Shake\\" with its bold swagger.
1573225517|4.0|the book is very funny and compulsive. I strongly  recommend the book because the great characters and the interesting story make you want to keep reading it.  And the book tells a lot about the guys's \\"secrets\\".   On the other hand, the book is so graphic on sex and manliness, but it tells us the guys'  thinking.
B0000085N4|5.0|the shamanistic psychedelic metal of LOVE with the -wall rock of ELECTRICsensation when it came certain circles. <br />Every even though they all rock. Classic rock influences and styles are evident, but the Cult claims them as their own. The \\" which is overwrought and cheesy. Everything else will transport you to .
B00004Y87O|4.0|I didn't see this film when it came out and it seemed like I would always turn on the tv and see a few minutes somewhere in the middle of it. Well, I finally bought the dvd and realized that this is certainly a strong film. The plot is okay, but a strong cast and great action make it worth seeing. They did a great job with making the city look like a ruined city that had been left to fall apart. This dvd is in a series from MGM where they only have the trailer as an extra, but these dvds do have a good price.
1559277238|4.0|We have listened to all seven of the previous Stephanie Plum books on audio cassette as we traveled to and from work. This Lorelei person is by far the worst reader. She does an okay job on the characters like Grandma Mazur, but Stephanie's voice is awful. She doesn't sound like a Trenton girl at all. We love the stories, but the previous readers made Stephanie so real to us, that this woman seems like a sick impostor.
0694003611|5.0|I love reading this book to my babies. They love it. It appears that there are two copies to this book, in one of them the pictures are not as bright. Make sure that you get the one with the very bright pictures. My daughter has memorized most of this book and reads it herself, looking at the pictures. I highly recommend it. We do not read it as a bedtime story or she would never go to bed!
1573222038|5.0|This book was quite good and makes me eager to read her other novels.  Waters accurately captures the seedier side of Victorian England--the pickpockets and fences, erotic book dealers and collectors, madhouses and inmates--in a richly complex novel that starts out slow but becomes un-put-downable at the end of Part 1.  The characters are well-written; the dialogue seems real; the intrigue is engrossing.  Unlike much of the trite, stereotypical works that pass for \\"good\\" lesbian fiction, Waters manages to write three dimensional lovers facing realistic obstacles to be together.  Waters even manages to pay a certain amount of homage to Victorian erotica--where the lesbian novel got its start by tittilating repressed men--by taking the themes that one comes across in such novels (bad girls vs. good girls who always seem to come under the power of very bad men, etc.) and turning them into something realistic.  This is a gritty novel that evokes the underside of the Victorian era in all its sensual reality.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. It has it all - a great story, good characters, hilarious comedy, and everyone in the family can enjoy it. Definetly a top-notch piece of work.
B000001Y5X|5.0|I love this music. I listen to it nonstop everyday. Call me crazy if you want but I could really care less. In my opinon, Mr. Manson is the best hard rock/heavy metal singer EVER!!! He's kooky, he's wicked, and he's not afraid to speak his mind. In this incredible album, Manson sings his evil heart out with smash hits like Lunch Box and Dope Hat. Oh, and did I forget to mention that this album IS NOT for the easily offended? VERY EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! On track # 7: Get Your Gunn, the GD word is used 7 times, and the F word is used several times as well. But despite that, Marilyn Manson is awesome and is one heck of a singing artist. What more can I say? GET IT!!! <BR>P.S. Kids, put your parents to bed! They can't handle listening to this!
0767812166|5.0|Awesome, tight romantic sci-fi drama that is one of the best romance movies of the last century.  This flick has great acting, good dialogue, a few splashes of humor, and provides subtle observations of our species.  The Nitzche score is very moving.  The FX are lacking, but the story doesn't require incredible FX scenes, just a few to prod the movie along.  Overall, an outstanding flick.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00006F7S4|5.0|First, I think that it's very interesting how this album has polarized the reviews. Some love it and some hate it, calling this album &quot;dull&quot;. Get past the first layer, please! Before buying this album I read a published review that advised people to listen to it several times before forming an opinion. That, I now agree, was an important piece of advice. Sea Change is not the big sound of Odelay, or some of Beck's sequels to Odelay(which I believe were not as successful musically), but SO WHAT! This album is very intimate and complicated, and it is the next logical step for a very talented musician and visual artist. It is a truly mature effort. Great artists need to change gears so as not to become stale. Beck has shifted, subtly, beautifully. True, there is pain in this album, but most good work has been created from this place. Sea Change has rapidly become one of my favorite albums of 2002. I often write with it playing and some of the songs have appeared in my dreams. Sea Change, a masterpiece.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Many of us had our first exposure to Dire Straits when MTV did nothing but air \\"Money for Nothing\\" from the \\"Brothers In Arms\\" album. It is unfortunate that that album became their defining moment because every album that proceeded it was exceptional. Of those exceptional albums, the album that was the greatest is their self-titled debut album. A mixture of blues, rock, Country and Mark Knopfler's unique guitar method fill the nine tracks of this album. <br />There is not a track on this album that you will want to skip. The opening track, \\"Down to the Waterline\\" sets the tone for the album. As the tune opens, you can almost picture yourself walking down the docks at night through a fog, and then a few well-placed notes on the guitar lead us into this upbeat song. The solo is killer as is all the guitar work throughout this song. \\"Water of Love\\" continues the magic with Pick Withers laying down a great rhythm track, and Knopfler playing slide on his Dobro. One of the best songs on the album is \\"Six Blade Knife\\", a very strong blues piece. This sound has been imitated many times, which is understandable because it is a great song. Knopfler's solos are slow and meaningful. He doesn't have to use a lot of notes to get his point across. Probably, the most popular song to come off this album is \\"Sultans of Swing\\", and it is easy to see why. The rhythm is catchy, the riffs between verses are powerful, and the solo is amazing. <br />There are not many powerful albums out there that can match this debut effort. If I had to keep but ten albums in my collection, this would definitely be one of them. If you're looking to get some Dire Straits, this album and the live \\"Alchemy\\" are the only ones you truly need. The others are quite good, but this one is simply the best.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Well it seems that people either love this movie or hate it.  I'v met people who say Moulin Rouge was a great movie while I'v also met people who litterally hate and despise the film.  I happen to be in the group that loves the film.  Sure the story may be kind of cheesy, but it's well done and touching.  Visually the movie is amazing.  The vibrant colors and elaborate costumes never bored me.  The music was great.  Some say the creator wasn't creative enough to use use his own music, but he cleaverly used great popular songs and remade them.  I don't know how they pulled of Roxanne, but they did.  The actors do a good job, their lines may come off as unrealistic, but the story is a simple almost fantasy type.  I am not a fan of musicals, the idea allways seemed silly to me, but this movie has changed my mind.  If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out, seems like you'll either love it or hate it, but its worth it to see what all the fuss is about.  The DVD is also loaded with all kinds of cool stuff.
B00005NTN5|3.0|Bound main appeal is not the alright crime plot behind it, or the powerful performances by the lead actors.  No what makes Bound so appealing is the one moment of HLA, or Hot Lesbian Action.  At least that's how I heard of it.<br />Any who Bound is about this biker chick who moves into a new appartment.  Next door there is this couple, the man works for the mo and the wife and just stays  at home.  The wife becomes attracted to her new neighbor and in the first half hour there is some decent HLA.  After that the rest of the movie spirals around a plot to steal some money from the mob and the husband and escape as a rich couple.  Things don't always go as planned and the husband discovers the plan, but by then the moneys already gone, and he has killed 2 mob members.  Overall the plot is alright, and the acting needs some work.  Overall it gets an extra star because it did have that good HLA moment.
B00000DLVA|5.0|Hey, why is it that when other people review The Cardigans' other CDs do they say this one was a dissapointment? This one is my absolute favorite! It isn't near as fake-peppy, over-happy stuff as the others were. Listening to their other records was like trying to eat a whole batch of fudge- it's just too much sweet stuff to take. This one, however, is just fun enough to keep from being depressing, and just dark enough to keep you involved. Their very best!<BR>PS> If you liked this one, Try Sneaker Pimps' Six Underground. It is absolutely haunting!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John's aweseome guitar playing capabilities, mixed with his smooth voice and deep meaningful and FUN lyrics make this title album of the year for me.  8 months after I purchased it I am STILL listening to this and his other album, Inside Wants Out, almost every day.<br />From deep and personal song meanings, to generalized statements based on his own experiences that anyone can relate to, or as he says, use as an excuse when the going gets ugly.<br />Buy this album, you will not be sorry!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I love thought-provoking movies. There are many interpretations that can come from this, but I wanted to share my own without giving much of the movie away. I was thinking about &quot;Silencio&quot;. Actors can play many different parts. Movies in themselves are not real, but the actors can portray events that really did happen. Actors take on many names. I do not believe in the dream interpretation for this reason. This is definitely a movie that you must watch more than once to fully be able to appreciate.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Even though this movie has not been released yet I am giving it five stars based on the preview I have seen.  The story is a continuation of the first movie from when Frodo and Sam left the group to destroy the ring on their own.  I think that in this movie there will be more of an emphasis on some of the major characters as well as more fighting and action scenes. It will be interesting to see how the plot develops more in this movie and I can't wait until it is released.  I think that the Two Towers will be much better than the first one because it will have better action and an emphasis on character development.  If you saw the first one and liked it, I highly recommend that you watch the Two Towers.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Hello fellow Earthlings. This album is probably one of the greatest Flaming Lips albums ever. Although it's weaker than The Soft Bulletin in my opinion it is still unbelievably amazing. The song Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Crazily good. That song just gave this album a perfect score. All the songs are good, so everybody should check The Flaming LIps out.

B00005JKCH|5.0|If it wasn't for the extras on this DVD it would be only worth 4 stars. Spiderman is only a good movie but it is not good enough to get five stars. With the edition of the extras this movie becomes exciting. There are hours of extras and if your computer has a DVD rom drive than you will be able to play three levels from the Spiderman video game. This DVD is well worth 50 bucks making it a deal at about 25. If you don't already have the DVD or even have the VHS version, you must buy it or regret it.
B000002B2X|5.0|Sap is a 5 song EP that Alice in Chains recorded on some down time after touring for Facelift, and i must say it truly is excellent. <BR>Everything is perfect about this album, Layne's(RIP) vocals, Jerry's guitar work is true perfection and the rhythm section is truly awesome, not to mention guest appearances on track 3 'Right Turn' by Mark Arm of Mudhoney and THE singer, Chris Cornell are perfect additions<BR>However despite the four absolutely awe-inspiring main tracks, somehow they took acid and recorded a really bad song for a bonus track which is basically the band mucking around, it really is out of place on this album<BR>But this album is worth getting for the four tracks alone, it was the first alice in chains album i had ever heard, which was about 3 or 4 months ago and now they are my favourite band.<BR>Also i'd recommend getting this version of SAP instead of the one that i got, it's Jar Of Flies with SAP as a bonus disc, which sucks because you don't get the sap booklet

B00005JL96|5.0|I saw 'Lilo & Stitch' tonight for the first  time and spent most of the film breathless with laughter.  Here is a Disney film that honors the Disney traditions of Innocence and The Big World without resorting to the skateboard and street-slang treatment of some of its more recent fare.<br />Fans of Chuck Jones' animation will be enormously gratified at the film's wit, humor and impeccable timing and, unlike some of the other  viewers, I found the moral of the story not heavy-handed, but rather dealt with in unexpected ways with surprisingly honest and often clever dialogue.  It is also a film of enormous heart, more like the kind of film Disney used to make long ago (before their sequel franchise became their focus),  and is one of the few Disney films of the last decade that is both contemporary and timeless.  Kudos to both directors and the artists that made it.<br />I rented this tonight, and am heading out to buy my own copy tomorrow.  I'm kicking myself for not seeing it at the cinema.  I promise you'll enjoy it.
0285502565|5.0|First of all, I will say that this is and excellent book and highly recommended. Erich is one of the few people out there in that are willing to think outside the square.<br />Too many scientists and scholars are wrapped in their own self glorly and ideals, that they refuse to consider a concept out of left field.<br />If we didn't accept ideas, concepts, theories, etc out of left field, where would we be today?!?! We would not have flight, electricity, the ability to transplant organs, computers, etc.<br />On a more personal note, my father was in South America a few years ago and went to a small, private, museum where they have artifacts dating back to over 11,000 years ago.<br />One piece that stands out is a human skull with a gold plate in it that has been dated at arounf 9,000BC.<br />What is astonishing is that the bone had mostly grown back over the plate. This indicates that brain surgery of some description was performed and was SUCCESSFUL!<br />How can anyone dispute ET interference with something like that??? You don't do brain surgery with hand axes and flint knives!<br />I get rather annoyed when people make false statements about Erich von Dèaniken to discredit him.<br />A few facts:<br />* yes he went to jail - he was imprisoned for 3 1/2 years for embezzlement and was TOTALLY unrelated to the writings in his books<BR>* Erich has NEVER had a case brought against him about the content of his books<br />All in all, Erich's books are an excellent insight into the past and that facts brought to light are hard to dispute...especially when my father can confirm a lot of the things Erich raises in his book.<br />Oh, by the way, I have never met or spoken to Erich, nor has my father, but I would dearly love to meet him and go on one of his adventures!
B000002UAX|4.0|Not really concerned on who agrees with me or not, or if this is their best album, I'll say what I think years after coming out of the delusion that The Beatles were the greatest band in the world.<br />When I listen to this album nowadays, I find it slightly disappointing. In particular the 'first' side. It happens when &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; begins, and I realise, and I wish more would, that by far it is the best song on the album in so many ways. One reason is, this is a song ABOUT something. It addresses something in particular, and is not fancified in its words or intent. When I hear the Lennon &amp; McCartney songs preceding and after it, they sound weak in comparison, nothing more than high standard pop, with nothing to say or do except enjoy its melodies and execution. 'Gently Weeps' has melancholy, power, and grace, and a weight to it, where 'Obla-di Obla-Da' just supplies flotsam.<br />After you come out of the first delusion of thinking that Lennon &amp; McCartney were a 'writing team', you are then asked to wonder, how do their songs stand up? Good songs no doubt, and I do not begrudge them their obvious talents. But one would expect with Lennon's burdgeoning 'political or anti-establishment' stance, that 'Revolution' or 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' might be about something topical or personal. But they're not. Lennon again remains 'pop'. Harrison's 'Piggies' on the other hand actually makes social observation and takes a stance as to what should be done in his own opinion. To ask McCartney to actually give an opinion about anything in his songs is like trying to break down a brick wall with a toothpick. Its never going to happen, which makes his songs in execution wonderful, in melody memorable, in content - lightweight and ineffectual. I look upon most of The Beatles work now as groundbreaking technically and in musical standards, but I honestly think that the majority of Lennon &amp; McCartney's work were pretty 'mindless', not saying much at all. Harrison on the other hand did say something. A great many things, but its too bad that people like ascribing genius to people that leave it up to you to decide what the songs about, rather than actually telling you something you just may need to know.uch at all.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Count me in as another fan of this movie.  I was reluctant to see this film at first; I had written off Lynch as losing his touch over the past ten years.  This flick puts him back at the forefront as the best writer/director in Hollywood today.  Mulholland Dr. is an instant classic along the lines of Hitchcock's Vertigo, Bergman's Persona, and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (all of which MD makes reference to).<br />This film has many layers beyond the dream vs. reality conundrum.  Once you 'figure it out', let yourself meditate on the various symbolic and psychological issues it presents.
0151008116|5.0|After reading the Life of Pi I realize that the story is much like a delicious literary pie. The crust or foundation is faith . Pi's faith encompasses three organized religions and demonstrates itself in Pi's limitless love and respect for the animals and nature that surround him. The filling of the literary pie is the astounding ocean adventure where Pi's faith and knowledge of the animal world is put to the ultimate test.The whipped cream of this literary pie are the many questions that leave the reader thinking long after the pie is eaten. Yann Martell is a master chef mixing all the ingredients of great storytelling into a Pi that leaves a sweet taste on the mind.
B000050X31|5.0|.<BR>This is a stunning visual production (with sets by David Hockney) that works in combination with an amusing tale to end in a light, cheery opera that pleases both adults and pre-teens.  The singers are in great shape, and Papageno is a fine clown.  If you know the opera, you won't be disappointed either:  the arias are spot on.  Subtitles are easily accessed.
0920668372|1.0|My grandson received this as a gift. He is four years old and when my daughter got to the end she felt creeped out and changed books. They are very close.....but she wasn't comfortable w/the ending......the mother driving across town w/a ladder and then the son rocking his elderly dying mother. It felt too bizarre for a four year old. There are so many wonderful, magical books out there regarding mother/child relationships.....I'd say save your money and buy a different, less disturbing book.
B00006J3WH|4.0|They could have kept the sound effects from the show, but overall this is great! An excellent companion piece to season 6 DVDs, when they get released.
B00006RU5B|3.0|The only reason I can't give this five stars is because I was never a Soundgarden fan, I'm a Rage fan. And do not be mistaken, they sound like Soundgarden not Rage. But, there are still some good songs so you might think it is worth checking out. I'll wait for Zach De La Rocha's solo album.
B00005JKCH|3.0|An above average movie version of a comic book superhero.  It is fun, exciting, and pretty true to the source material.  However, it is a bit lacking in emotional drama.  Toby Maguire does do a good job with Peter Parker, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both well-rounded characters.  There is both good conflict and good comic relief in the form of Flash Johnson and J. Jonah Janeson.  But Mary Jane is lacking in much depth, and The Green Goblin is almost a caricature of a comic book villian.  This seems a good start, but there will need to be more character development to make me really feel for these characters.<br />While I am an avid comic book fan, and I enjoy the occasional Spider-Man story, Spider-Man has never really hooked me.  This movie felt the same way:  an enjoyable story and some good characters, but that's about it.  I will look forward to the next movie, but not as much as I will look forward to others.

B00003CXCD|5.0|A million stars!!!...  I simply love EVERYTHING about this movie! This is an all time classic; a romantic comedy that truly stands the test of time;  a film that I shall cherish as long as I live!  Director William Wyler is the MASTER!  The chemistry between Hepburn and Peck is electrifying!  (Eddie) Albert is the sweet icing on top of a very delicious cake!     <br />The DVD contains some very rare footage of Hepburn auditioning for the role; not to mention a very neat documentary about the making of the film and valuable interviews with the stars (including Peck and Albert).  <br />For you \\"modern\\" love birds out there.....you gotta start appreciating what the older generations had to offer; hence, I suggest postponing Harry Potter and treating your significant other to this awesome DVD.  It is the perfect movie to watch on your first, second, third..... n+1 date!    <br />This DVD is a MUST HAVE for all Audrey Hepburn fans!  She looks so graceful, elegant, sweet, charming, funny, beautiful, innocent, gorgeous...oh gosh...I LOVE HER!!!...  <br />YOU WILL LOVE HER TOO!!!...
B00006F2TV|5.0|I love spider man. Because it has a lot of action, I like to watch the movie. Me and my friends watch it at my house. My little brother loves to watch the movie spider man. Me I have the move. spider man is cool!
B00003CY6M|3.0|Enough fun and romance for me to enjoy seeing it once.  But the plot is a both predictable and far-fetched.  It's OK, but there are other movies that are both more fun and more romantic.
B00006CXXU|5.0|As someone who typically listens to Radiohead, U2 and The Beatles, I am surprised to find myself addicted to this album. I didn't care for Christina's previous effort; I thought she had a good voice, but found most of the material lacking. This release, though, is the complete opposite.<br />There's not a bad track on this album. There are a few that are not quite up to the level of the rest, but, for the most part, every song on this album could be a single. There's something for everyone on this album, from the Latin-flavored &quot;Infatuation&quot; to the rock-filled &quot;Make Over&quot; to the aptly titled ballad &quot;Beautiful&quot; to dance tracks like &quot;Get Mine Get Yours&quot; and &quot;Dirrty&quot;. This is a solid effort, and one of  the best new albums I've heard in the last year.
B00003CXXO|2.0|This movie will make you feel REALLY REALLY BAD.  It's a combination of the most wrenching aspects of Frankenstein [in the creation and subsequent utter abandonment of a \\"living\\" creature who loves], Pinocchio [dangerous quest for something that doesn't really exist] and Close Encounters [nice aliens to offset cruel, destructive, petty and mean-spirited humans].  Haley Joel Osment is a pleasure to watch, a fine young actor, and if his character turns out to be the last \\"living\\" and active remnant of a dead human civilization, we could do worse than to have it be he.  At the same time, the way his character is treated and the way the story's world is make one positively glad that no human survives to taint the universe.  Kubrick tends to showcase the negative in the human creature, and he does it here through \\"mecha's\\" who are present at every level of society, primarily as toys and servants or slaves, and their position in it.  They are throw-aways, exacberating the human need to trod underfoot some segment of its population to make itself feel powerful and safe.  Spielberg was chosen, as I guess, to take over Kubrick's project because he likes to showcase the things human beings like about themselves, the more admirable characteristics.  However, he routinely does it through contrasting types, playing the flawed against the godlike or turning the marginally corrupt into examples of courage and dignity.  On the face of it, this collaboration should have worked.  I think it doesn't because our present civilization has serious and lingering doubts about its worthiness to survive and even its capacity to do so.  Making a film like this makes those doubts and fears more tangible than we would like in something from Spielberg.  And he creates an ending where David the artificial boy finally gets the love he craves from his mother [for one day] and falls asleep forever with her in her bed, feels like a cheat.  After telling us a horrid truth about ourselves, Spielberg sends us home with pretty lie.  We aren't that dumb; we know some things can't be whitewashed by nice aliens with honkey-dorey technology. To try to do this is to excise the only good thing this film had to offer: truth about the human condition. The film was very thoughtful, but I wouldn't want to retread the thought-path again anytime soon.
B00005Q45W|4.0|This is the second time within a span of a year                   or so that this artist has utterly surprised us.                  The first was with the release of his concert                    performances from 1979 on Field Commander                        Cohen which wowed us with its brilliant                          musicality. Now Cohen has returned from a                         self-imposed, 6-year period of spiritual retreat in               the service of his guru to stun us with this                      exquisite album. The modesty of the album's title                 is a harbinger of the simple beauty of the songs                  that lie within. Like a carefully constructed                     haiku, each song is presented with a minimum of                   elements and consummate restraint. Haunting                       melodies, poetic lyrics, spiritual yet earthbound,                and quietly evocative instrumentation. Sharon                     Robinson has produced the CD with a light and                     deft touch, coloring these straightforward songs                  with hints of r&amp;b and even reggae. And her airy                   harmonies provide the perfect counterbalance                     for Cohen's deep, whispered vocals which seem                     to emerge through the floorboards.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia proves that Christopher Nolan, along with Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, and David Lynch, is one of the few \\"auteur\\" directors in Hollywood.  A movie that few directors would want to tackle, Insomnia is a dark psychological thriller set in a literal barren landscape of Alaska.  Nothing is what it seems on the surface.  Al Pacino is brilliant and reveals the complexity of his character in the role of a cop under investigation by internal affairs for misconduct sent to Alaska to help with a murder investigation.  The cinematography is absolutely astounding.  The bright visuals of the outside giving a feeling of boundless nothingness to the world while the dark, dank, closed interiors emphasize Pacino's mental state perfectly throughout the film.  Although slightly more conventional than Memento, Nolan's neo-noir masterpiece, in Insomnia he has crafted a tight thriller emphasizing the atmosphere of dread that pervades the entire film.  The film is somewhat slow at times, but since the film is intended to be a police-procedural it must show police work as what it is most of the time.  It is a painstakingly slow process whereby detectives actually have to think and contemplate their next move.  I believe Nolan also slows the film down to force the audience to process the information along with the police.  This tone and style serves in direct contrast to the kinetic fast pace of Memento where one's perception of the character's and their motivations are changed after each scene so you've barely processed the information before that info has become void or altered.  Obviously Nolan was attempting to put the audience into Leonard's head.  The intention with Insomnia I believe was to make a more distanced picture talking about the fraily of the human condition.
0380018179|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels, and the plot line is among the best: the epic of a forbidden love that flowers between a strong-willed young woman and a priest. The book sweeps you from post-World War I New Zealand, the barren Australian outback, the Vatican, and back to Australia. My only criticism was that it didn't have to spend so much time droning on and on about all the details of life in the outback. Most of us can't empathize with rabbit overpopulations, Aborigines dressed as cowboys, sheep, etc. But the book is excellent nonetheless.<br />TTB is an utter pathos and a study in the sacrifices we make to stay true to our faith and values.
B00005QIPH|5.0|These guys are the future of rock. When The Strokes' is This It came out, I think this gave rock music a kick in the [butt] that it needed.  I personally hated all that kid Rock/Korn/System of a Down junk. All the songs on here are great like \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Someday\\", \\"Last Night\\" and the title track. These guys are so good that The Rolling Stones chose them to open a couple of shows.  I think The Strokes will be around for awhile.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This debut is one of those unusual albums in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Mayer is a young recording artist who writes catchy, well-crafted, tends-to-grow-on-you pop songs with workmanlike lyrics. He has a pleasant, albeit monochromatic voice-- resembling Dave Matthews and/or Marc Cohn (without quite the soul) crossed with Michael Franks and/or Kenny Rankin (without quite the chops). He plays a very tasty guitar and is backed by a fine corps of musicians. The music here is easy-listening, vanilla pop, with unobtrusive yet uninspired arrangements and production. Nevertheless, it is a relaxing, insinuating, and enjoyable listen; a nice balance to the edgier, moodier stuff we normally prefer; and, in its own subtle way, quite unlike anything else we've heard lately. Maybe its the harsh times we are living in, but we're surprised how frequently we have found this in our CD player.
0316666343|1.0|i bought this book after reading the new york times review of it. generally, i trust the opinion of the particular times reviewer who wrote about it. but in this case, i think she went far astray. this is a paint-by-numbers oprah book: it's overwritten, contrived, and speciously literary. i feel a bit bad bashing oprah books because i was actually glad that oprah set the country reading again and i thought she made plenty of good book choices. but...she did also popularize a kind of women's literature that i find irritating and overly precious. and this book falls into--actually, personifies, if you can use that word about a book--that kind of writing. if you're the sort of reader interested in serious literary fiction--the national book award winning kind of stuff--i don't recommend that you buy this book. it will disappoint you.
0064407667|5.0|Wonderful!  Not only are these books depressing, but also hilarious!  Such a refreshing departure from happy-go-lucky kids' books. Though I am an adult, I enjoyed this book very much and am going to read the others in the series.<br />I appreciate the way the author defines the more advanced vocabulary in the book -- it saves readers the trouble of locating and lumbering through a dictionary.
B000002H4C|4.0|Before metal in the eighties was all about hairspray, there was a generation of hard rock that really rocked.  The Heavy Metal soundtrack accompanies the animated film of the same name, and many have said that the songs here are better than the movie.  Truth be told, by today's standards, many of these songs don't qualify as \\"heavy metal.\\"  I mean, Cheap Trick, Journey and Don Felder?  But, most of these songs work in the context in which they are presented.<br />Sammy Hagar's version of \\"Heavy Metal\\" has far more energy than the one on his solo LP.  The guitar part is just more crunchy and aggressive and the bassline has more punch.<br />Riggs has two numbers on this disk, \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Radar Rider\\" and I've never heard of these guys since.  \\"Radar Rider\\" has some cool distorted guitar licks and pounding drums and worked great with the corvette descending to earth.<br />Devo, now there's a heavy metal act, presents \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\" in typical quirky fashion with train and hammer effects.  The lyrics are comic chain gang.  This is a fun tune, helped me survive hell week in college, and only later did I learn it was a cover of a song from the sixties, I think by Leo Dorsey.  I wish they would have also included \\"Through With Being Cool\\" from the movie \\"cantina scene\\" but both can be found on a Devo disk.<br />BOC's contribution was co-written with SF/Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock and is full of synths and tribal drums and space-age lyrics.  \\"Wounds are all I'm made of...\\"<br />Cheap Trick also has two numbers, the synth-driven \\"Reach Out\\" and \\"I Must Be Dreamin'\\" with Bun E. Carlos really driving on the drums.<br />Don Felder steps out of the shadows of the Eagles with \\"Heavy Metal - Takin' a Ride\\" a slow burner with excellent lead guitar work.  Even better is \\"All of You,\\" a laid-back cruising tune for all those plutonium nyborg fans.<br />\\"True Companion\\" comes to us from Donald Fagen of Steely Dan fame.  This tune has a long instrumental with cool guitar licks that I'm guessing were by Jeff Baxter.  Nice vocal harmonies.<br />Who would have thought of Elvis Costello being included here, but \\"Prefabricated\\" by Trust is a rocker!  One of the most rocking on the disk.<br />Black Sabbath's Dio-era \\"Mob Rules\\" is one of the few truly heavy metal tunes, with it's machine gun guitar, thundering bass, and throbbing drums.  This fit perfectly with the invasion/sacking scene in the movie.<br />Songs by Nazareth, Journey, Grand Funk Railroad and Stevie Nicks round out the set.uitar licks that I'm guessing were by Jeff Baxter.

B000066NW0|4.0|I actually like the music, but I hate Avril herself. I suggest that you get the album because it IS fairly good :) I just don't like the whole \\"Punk\\" thing Avril is sporting... I think it seems kind of fake, no offense O_O
B000002BQK|5.0|Every song in this album tells a story of what she has been through for the past 7 years of her musical career. It showcases a different and mature style of music from the then-27 year old Carey. As an artist, you learn to mature in your work and try on different things with your talent and what you're capable of. And Mariah has proven that on this album. BUTTERFLY is very heartfelt, though different...but in a personal level apart from her previous recordings. It heralded her \\"Artistic Freedom\\" so to speak with this album!!!
B00000GJ2B|1.0|Martin Scorsese isn't a bad fellow, and he has a lot of talent, no doubt, but his influence on young American moviemakers has been entirely negative.  The galloping illiteracy of this film, the first of Scorsese's f-word festivals, has infected dozens of other directors and screenwriters, and has even spread to television, where we see a sewage backup like &quot;The Sopranos&quot; being acclaimed by many who should know better.  The screenplay of &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is shot through with inaccuracies, and nobody who remembers Jake LaMotta performing on &quot;Car 54 Where Are You&quot; is going to accept him as a tragic figure.  The real tragedy is the debasement of the English language and its inexhaustible variety by a film like this.

B00006LSM3|5.0|While John Lennon and Paul McCartney always got more credit while in the Beatles, I've found George Harrison's solo output in many ways more rewarding of all the Beatles. Not taking anything away from John and Paul, whom I also love (and Ringo of course) but when George was at his best (All Things Must Pass, Living in the Material World, Cloud Nine), the results were truly magical. You can add his final studio album to the list of magical moments in an unbelievable career. This was the album he was working on up to a few months before his passing in November 2001. He gave special instructions to son Dhani and longtime friend/producer/Travelling Wilbury Jeff Lynne on how he wanted the album to sound. George had already laid down the guitar (or ukelele in some cases) as well as the vocals, but the album still needed some touching up. The end result is a 12-song masterpiece, an album you don't want to take out of your CD player. Every track is catchy, from the shuffling Wilburys-style folky rocker \\"Any Road\\" to the final track, the title song \\"Brainwashed\\" where the mystical Beatle rails against the ills of the Material World, this album never slacks off. And in many of the lyrics, his own mortality is discussed, but not in a glum way, but as a matter-of-fact type deal. After all, he was the man who penned the lyrics \\"all things must pass away\\" so he was accepting of his fate and ready to take the final step. Other highlights include the beautiful slide guitar work which surrounds the catchy \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud,\\", the wistful \\"Looking for My Life\\" and the amazing instrumental \\"Marwa Blues.\\" But every song is wonderful, do yourself a favor and find out! Buy this album!
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is a refreshing story about survival, human spirit, and perseverance.  Martel's voice is fresh and humerous.  The story, and Pi's perspective are very thought provoking.  I have not read many novels that change the way  I look at the world, if only for a short time, and this book has done that.  If you have ever found yourself questioning your faith, or denying the exisitence of something more, you will greatly appreciate this story.  This is a great book.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Although I don't think anyone can compare any artist to the phenomenal voice of Diana Krall, I think Norah Jones is a sound of her own.  Her voice is very distinct in character and she captivates the mood in each of her songs.   I've heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; several times not knowing the artist and finally the song would just be in my head so I had to find out &quot;who is this woman.&quot;  After reviewing her other songs I have been inspired to seek more!

B000068OCS|4.0|Koyaanisqatsi is not at all your typical film. It has no plot, no actors, no dialogue. Yet it carries a strong message through a visual barrage of beautiful cinematography and accompanying music by composer Philip Glass.<br />I had been curious about this film for some time, so I finally checked it out expecting to be bored by it but kept an open mind. I broke my usual rule of no drinking when watching a movie for the first time and had a few shots of tequila, then settled into Koyaanisqatsi. Right from the start as the naturalistic images washed over me, I felt them carry me away. Each image gave way to another, juxtaposed to compare or contrast with the shot before it. Eventually the naturalistic visuals gave way to city and technology, the shots becoming more and more fast paced. And the music fully enhanced the experience, making each view come even more alive. Of course I was somewhat drunk too. But that state only seemed to enhance the film, rather then detract as is usually the case. Without dialogue or plot, my condition helped me let me take in the underlying message of technology creeping into life, taking away individuality and ruining peoples lives. Of course that's just my interpretation, the beauty of this film is it means something different to everyone who watches.<br />This film is, of course, by no means something everyone will enjoy. Most mainstream viewers would find it utterly boring. To be honest, near the end when the alcohol began to wore off, I was beginning to lose a bit of interest too. But in the proper reflective mood, this film almost works as therapy. And if accompanied by a few drinks, can become eye opening. Definitely worth while if intrigued by the idea. And worth a spot in your collection if you need that occasionally therapy session in your own home.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Not since his song &quot;Mexico&quot; have I enjoyed Beck's music so much. There are no upbeat songs on this album, and I like it that way. The songs are gorgeous and expressive, even aching at times. &quot;Lonesome Tears,&quot; &quot;Round the Bend&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; rank among my favorites, but others are sure to grow on me as much as these. <br />For those who &quot;can't listen to this album alone,&quot; trust me, you'll love it one day after you've taken the time to really feel the ache of love lost.<br />This record is a celebration of feelings, an indulgence in dark beauty.
B00000IUP4|5.0|We received this Autostop and Start Engine as a gift from Brio when I wrote them about the lack of power/functionality from the Mighty Red locomotive we purchased (which I've also reviewed here at Amazon.com). Brio's customer service is outstanding. (Only Playmobil's is better, in my opinion.)<br />First, this Autostop engine is a classic toy design--very cute and works reasonably well in chug-chugging cars around the track. It can pull a decent load if all on a flat track without too many curves. Add a curvy track or hills and this little engine doesn't have the power nor traction to pull more than 2 or 3 cars. And, surprisingly, this does a better job pulling cars than the more expenive Mighty Red Locomotive.<br />We love the Start 'n' Go track feature, and for that I am less critical of this little engine. This engine does lack the charming sounds and elegant forward/reverse/stop buttons that grace the Mighty Red. The green Autostop engine also will not freewheel, which means your child can ruin the gears pushing this engine around.<br />However, we have gained much more satisfaction from Learning Curve's battery-operated Thomas and Great Railway Adventures engines. First, even the smallest Great Railways Adventures or Thomas engine has four wheel drive, which adds much to the ability to pull cars around. They still struggle--mostly because of a lack of traction on the wooden tracks--to pull cars up the hills, but nothing like the Brio engines. Great Railways Adventures, in particular, do have engines patterned after famous engines of the past, and this more \\"mature\\" styling has allowed them to age better with our 6 year old than the Thomas engines. (Thomas engines do have a cuteness factor that Brio can't compete with either.). <br />Great Railways/Thomas battery-operated engines \\"free wheel,\\" making them less prone to damage caused by young kids unfamiliar with using the switch. That said, these switches are as clumsy as the Brio green Autostop engine. Not evenBrio has duplicated the elegant design of their Mighty Red on any of their other toys, and Learning Curve hasn't copied them. They should.<br />Even still my recommendation is Learning Curve's Great Railway Adventures collection. Very similar cost, but with free-wheeling gear protection; four-wheel drive; die cast metal construction (engines only); more realistic styling; and charming sounds and actions available through a variety of battery-operated (and non-battery-operated) stock cars.
0739301985|1.0|John Grisham should be ashamed of himself.  This is the lamest, weakest, most boring, sad excuse for literature that I've ever encountered.  Obviously intended to be a quick hit to his bank account.
1573225517|4.0|Back when I worked in a bookstore, I my father used to send me lists of things to pick up for him. He requested mainly books about bread-baking and biographies, his two passions. I was surprised when High Fidelity made the list, since he rarely read contemporary fiction.<br />A year later, he had forced every woman he knew to read it. &quot;This is how it is to be a man.&quot; he said. I've heard the same thing from other men as well.<br />I truly enjoyed High Fidelity, although I am a young woman and not a man, because it is funny, touching, and entertaining from the first page to the last. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided that High Fidelity is Fear of Flying for men. It's too bad it has taken so long for Nick Hornby to provide for men what Erica Jong gave women decades ago, but it should be considered required reading for any man who reads or any woman who wants to understand them. This is not a touchy feely sensitive guy book - that just wouldn't do the trick. The main character is snobby, manipulative, self-absorbed, and acts like a fourteen year old sometimes. He has carefully manufactured a life for himself where nobody can tell him what to do by owning a record store and sabatoging his relationships with women. But he is actually pretty cool - he has great taste in music and listens to everything, and he's hilarious. You can't judge him too harshly for being normal. <br />I enjoyed the movie, but for completely different reasons than the book. The movie is the story of a guy trying to figure out whether or not he wants to grow up and commit to a relationship. The book is about the walls men put up to protect themselves, the escape routes they build from reality, what they really want out of life, and what makes them fail or succeed at getting it. Only The Full Monty is as good a story of the inner lives of men.
B000001ESN|5.0|I'm just your average Heavy Metal fan. I grew up listening to the bands like Rush, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Scorpions, and a few others....    Once \\"Chronicles\\" was released, I thought it would be pointless to go out and spend money on the entire Rush collection. That was a big mistake...    After several years had passed, I decided that I needed to get into Rush more than I ever had. I loved \\"Moving Pictures\\" back when it was released, but I had yet to really truly understand what Rush was all about prior to that release....Another big mistake.    So, I went out determined to find out the truth. I started with 2112, A Farwell To Kings, and Hemispheres. I loved them all....    What I really enjoyed the most, was the musical brilliance these guys have. All of them are incredible musicians. From 2112 - Hemispheres, you really get a great variety of the time, and effort Rush puts into their music, and all three of those releases deserve five stars....    That brings us to \\"Permanent Waves\\". This release is where the sound for \\"Moving Pictures\\" was first born IMO. This is without question my favorite Rush release. It has power, beauty, and intelligence all wrapped into one. The production here is awesome as well. Rush must have really spent some serious time getting this release perfect, because that's exactly what it is to me....PERFECT.    This is a great place to start for any new Rush fan. It's not too \\"sci-fi\\" like 2112, and it's not all \\"radio friendly\\" like Moving Pictures was. \\"Permanent Waves\\" is Rush in their purest form IMO. No wimpy filler here at all...    This is also my favorite Rush release of all time....
0385335482|1.0|I was in the mood for lite and easy and that's just what I got.  A fast reading paperback I could stuff in my bag, read on the subway and get through quickly.  I found Becky to be spoiled, bratty and no one I could relate to.  I did not feel that she deserved her fairy tale ending either.  It was all just too patt and easy for her.
6300185311|3.0|That's the kind of [bad] title ya get when you're trying to be witty.<br />I admit, I've watched this movie about 5 times, because I really like Doris and Rock. Tony Randall is exceedingly funny as well. But in this particular movie, the chemistry, the story, it just doesn't live up to the high standards that these three actors generally rate.<br />Rock is a hypochondriac, and Doris is his loving and devoted wife. Tony is their neighbor and good friend. Rock overhears his doctor giving a terminal diagnosis to another patient and assumes he is the one who is about to kick the bucket.<br />An old flame of Doris's comes into to town, a real Texas he-man-type and Rock tries to get them together, thinking this slob would make a good husband. Then Doris gets the wrong end of the stick and thinks Rock's having an affair. meanwhile,Tony gets very drunk.<br />Two scenes stand out to me, and don't ask me why, the morning breakfast scene, where Doris is eating her cornflakes (I always have a bowl when I watch this movie, weird, I know) and toasting toast at the table (What a great idea, to put the toaster at the table!)<br />And then, at the very start, when Doris is collecting her milk at the door, and the dry-cleaning delivery boy, with his transistor radio, remember those! Well, neither do I. But in the latter scene, I didn't really think the whole thing was funny. I felt bad for Doris and I thought the dry-cleaning delivery [guy] was blyuck!<br />There are funny moments, and I'd put up wth just about anything to see these three actors in a comedy.
0060245867|5.0|This is a good choice even for children younger than four years (the recommended age). My son is 17 months old and he really likes this book. It is the only one out of all his books that he will sit still long enough to listen to. He will actually go and get it and bring it to me to read. We really like it, and I would recommend it to everyone.

0385508417|1.0|Garbage.  Pure and simple.<br />Poorly written.  Lousy plot.  Cynical curmudgeon decides he and the wife will skip Christmas, going on a cruise instead.  He considers his neighbors are dolts or scam artists-- including the fire department.  Then the daughter, doing volunteer work in South America, decides to come home for Christmas-- with her new husband.  Daughter springs this on curmudgeon and wife on Christmas Eve.  There will be no skipping Christmas this year!  They must make a traditional Christmas for her, even though the whole world is closed for business.  The neighbors come to the rescue, ala \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  And curmudgeon re-discovers the meaning of Christmas.  Garbage!<br />Don't waste your money.<br />If you want a really good book, read \\"Peace Like a River\\" by Leif Enger.  Though it is not a Christmas book persay, it has a Christmas scene in it that will genuinely spark your spirit.  You will enjoy it.
B000002UVX|5.0|This paticular album is a true masterpiece.I don't think you will ever hear anything like this in your life.Machine gun absolutly captures that era in time(late 60's-Vietnam-protest etc.)but Jimi's playing is different on this one.Every chord,every scream,everything you could want a guitar player to possibly play Jimi does it!<BR>                THIS IS EXTREME GUITAR!
