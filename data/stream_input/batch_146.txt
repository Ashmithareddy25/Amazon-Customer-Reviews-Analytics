B007JMTOT0|5|Fits perfectly,looks great and does what it is suppose to do. If you need one for your winch, buy  one of these at a very good price.
B000IVT5D4|5|A+++
B00IMLGHW4|5|installed all around the inside of the truck bed and ti glows red and purple. But does light up the bed real well.
B0023VFV2Q|5|product was exactly what i expected. easy install.
B0017R5EHO|5|Excellent Product
B00EEGJACK|5|Works well for the price
B007636KGC|5|High quality
B00125JQXY|5|I love these.  Bought a second set for my second truck.  They are simple, reliable, seem durable, accurate and have made frequent airing down at the beach a real pleasure.  I highly recommend these.  They take a little time at first to get them adjusted, but the time is well spent.
B0009IQW0A|5|Thank you im glad to buy with you
B0009VIQ1A|5|Works well, they have been making these things forever. the cover is hard to put back on the handle after you wash it, but other than that, works great, very fast shipping
B00V40O402|5|Excellent replacement part. Fairly easy to install on a 2010 Vibe.
B000FR61JM|4|1995 Chevy was choking on gas.  This little gem did the trick.  Easy enough install and she's up and running!  The only reason why I have it 4 stars opposed to 5 is that I heard there is a \\"updated\\" spider assembly that has little wires that run to each injection nozzle opposed to this poppit style injector.  But I figured for the price of this and probably another 100k miles or so (if the truck makes it) It wasn't necessary.
B001AVSIOI|1|Less than a year old and  I had to drill the lock to open it out. Corrosion was bad (with the cover on) to the point that I could not get the key to get in. Finally after i did it did not turn, I used wd 40 to loose it up applied about 5 times in about 2 hours period, then when i was triyng to turn the key broke inside. It should not do that in less than 1 year. I have issues with other master products. I will NEVER buy master again
B009FNWFZ6|5|Love it
B003TU662Y|3|Very good
B000KIVPME|5|Excellent quality, rolls over wide expansion joints and low profile.
B0092PXMAY|4|As the name implies, it is easy to use.  It worked well in our small SUV, which had a faint &#34;moldy&#34; odor (I suspect from the heating/AC unit).  Use just requires you to close the windows, start up the AC on high, and activate the can.  After the can was finished and the car was aired out for a while, there was a slight residual &#34;fresh&#34; smell (not unpleasant).  In my case it wasn't a permanent fix, but it did keep the vehicle odor free for 3-4 months.
B00BVGOSXC|5|extremely fast
B00VLC0ARO|5|Absolutely love it! will order more soon:)
B000C5815O|2|It fit well in my honda CRX Si. no problems with the install except that the hole drilled into the bolt was too far from the ball joint itself, and the cotter pin was useless with the castle nut. the nut came loose after a week and was loud and sounded gnar. I took the nut off and used blue thread locker. been fine since.
B000H94F6E|5|I charge my 1951 pontiac chieftain's 6-volt, and then my 2007 harley Davidson 12-volt right after.<br />works great as a charge AND tender.<br /><br />cheapest one out there and it works.
B0002U1TYY|4|it's good stuff works well with the polish and wax and or by itself , polish or wax ant thing 3 times and it should shine but it goes on easy and comes off easy , not real easy but easy
B00B2QCVMQ|5|Love it
B000CFEZTA|5|the wiper motor worked great in the 1996 plymouth voyager.  Good price and good value
B00CJ5DY16|5|Was having problems getting brakes bled on my Corvette.  After hooking this up, the whole bleeding process took less than 15 minutes.  I needed thes ages ago
B009M9CTLS|4|My daughter loves this for her new car. The holes on top are a bit bigger than standard license plate screws so you will need to use washers. Otherwise, a nice product.
B000KL4XT8|5|Good harness for easy install. Wires come with shielding precut so you can just pull it off and not mess with wire strippers and if you don't need a wire, just leave the shield on.    Installed audio system with no issues at all.    Keep in mind that THIS is all that you need to install an audio system in a Civic. You do not need a \\"kit\\" the CD tray under the OEM stereo can be reattached to the aftermarket system and both can be mounted just like the OEM was. The kit makes it easier to remove and replace systems, but really how often do you intend to switch your audio system around?
B009XSK5VY|4|just getting in a cheap paper in air cabin to fill in and save $... waste of $$ for this part of car
B0016GUMIC|3|The designs are NOT glued on very well. I have had to re-attach several of them with E-6000 glue. The ones I put back on have stayed on and I am continuously on the look-out for others that are failing so I can get them glued back on rather than split or get lost. Already lost part of one of the ladybugs. Not very good construction but it sure is cute.
B002XFVVLC|2|glass off the mirror does not hold in place as it is has to be(broken holders on the inside)
B000LNBLTK|5|Great value.  I used them a few times and they did the trick.  They are very hard plastic, so they don't mark up panels.  They easily remove the interior trunk panels in my '04 BMW M3.
B0019RD49C|5|excellent fit, finished well, very strong, no complaints at all, looks perfect on my 99 z71. it come in a matte black primed finish that looks great, i have been very happy with this purchase and with all the SS products ive bought from them in the past. great company
B00718W5GQ|4|The cable works great and does not drag like my old cable did.  The pin that came with the cable did not fit my 2007 Fleetwood Westlake.  I just used the old pin and attached to the cable.
B006PJMO4K|5|Got this in order to mount a skybox on the roof.  The crossbars are easy enough to install BUT require a particular tool to fasten the crossbars (not a regular screwdriver).  We had to borrow a friend's (who is a car guy) to complete the job.  The crossbars can be adjusted and slid as needed with a regular screwdriver however.  Otherwise, functions exactly as we needed it to!
B007O0BNGE|4|I guess it's doing what it's suppose to do. Fast shipping, but a little on the expensive side. Thought I was getting two for the price, but after looking back and re-reading the ad I see it was for one, but it was a little deceiving. Great piece, but can be found cheaper else where.
B0036E9VB6|5|I was a little hesitant if this thing would have enough juice to inflate a flat on my GT-R (20&#34; 285 tire) but this sucker filled it from flat to 34 PSI in a little over 2 minutes. It even has a little LED light so you can see what you are doing. Feels extremely solid. Excellent buy!
B002H9GRSQ|5|While removal was a challenge, putting in the new complete assembly was a breeze. The Explorer sits properly now and drive like a dream. I shutter to think what putting in individual components instead of the complete assembly would be like. Yikes!
B006BDGDXI|5|This remote works great. No pressure at all needed to not buttons, just push and the car responds instantly. So much better than the ones the car came with (used).
B000C9TCDA|5|best filter brand  great product
B000GTJA56|4|I bought these jaws to give my ratcheting crimping pliers the ability to aid in making some custom spark plug wires.  The portion of the jaws that crimps the connector is fine.  It took a couple of wires to perfect \\"the art\\" of it but I got the hang of it fairly quickly.  They produce the perfect crimp needed for the terminal connectors.  The area in which they are a let down is that the cutting teeth that are supposed to help strip the wire but not damage the core.  For starters they are sharp enough to cut through anything.  Second, even when fully crimped there is a gap where the jaw's edges should meet.  I ended up using a razor blade and steady hand to cut and strip the wires.  There are stand-alone tools out there that aid in stripping spark plug wires.  If you are going to be doing several sets of wires it would probably be a worth while investment.
B006E4MMZM|5|Loved it thanks
B005MVB6TG|4|These are very nice snap ring pliers. The price was acceptable for the quality. I do not use them often but they have not let me down yet.
B007N6SXDU|5|Well made, rugged!  Fit my 2012 Tundra double cab perfectly.  FAST shipping by autoplicity.com!  autoplicity.com's description says this unit will only fit 2007-2010 Tundras; however, according to the Du-Ha website, this unit (in black) will fit all 2007-2012 Tundras double cabs without the subwoofer.  The 3 colors match the Tundra interior colors nicely. Securely held in place with three heavy-duty screw-on metal bolts each covered with a easy-to-grip round, plastic knob. Took me less than two minutes to install. Comes with rubber/plastic inserts/partitions designed to hold rifles/shotguns securely in place. Nearly doubles the storage space of the Toyota OEM storage unit that comes standard with the Tundra convenience package. Some may miss the Toyota OEM storage unit's built-in cover. However, the Du-Ha sits much higher and flush with the bottom of the rear seats, so many won't miss the cover.
B000MK5LWK|5|This is a great box and well made.  Material thickness heavier than some others I looked at.  With some modifications it works great as a drop in, over axial cargo box for my canoe/kayak trailer.
B008G2XMD6|5|The lights shipped promptly, fit correctly based on the online diagnostic tool and even came with interior wiring for the light body.  Great product and great company.
B000FPY63M|2|good looking parts but need cross bar reinforcement. not really suitable for hard use or as winch points. steel seems soft.
B00130LI9I|1|Hmmmm. This is interesting.  The photo of product (MotorCraft Mercon V) is the OLD bottle with the earlier fuild.  They haven't made that fluid since 2007.  Since then, the new mix is in a Black bottle.  So, how old is this transmission fluid?    JD
B002833LL2|3|upon purchasing this product for a gift, I was under the impression it was an aluminum emblem on plastic backing.  When opening it I realized it was all plastic, with a mirror finish and wasn't meeting my expectations for it.  If I knew I was only getting plastic that would not realistically stand up to outdoor conditions I wouldn not have paid the 8 dollars or so plus shipping for it.
B00LBIUOTM|5|I had an issue with 2 ballast and they were very quick to resolve the issue for me. The output of these lights are amazing! They are super bright which make them great for off roading or dark locations. I recommend buying these !
B001UEBXNS|5|work like OEM.
B00D9BX6TO|3|the design is great but what they don't tell you is that you have to buy some specific liquids so that you can stick it
B000BWCFSC|5|Looks great, comes with hardware, cleans real easy, doesn't feel heavy duty but at this price who cares, also its n lo the a high stress part,if your water pressure breaks this you got something wrong
B00BHD69QS|5|so nice, a cool way to keep your key safe!!!
B001GN3GVA|5|Hello, I use these for pull points on my jeep. They weld on nicely and are well suited for the job of pulling my jeep.
B0094NOANW|5|Fits 2009 Nissan Murano LE. You'll need a torque wrench to tighten them correctly.
B00LIZALL4|5|Shipping was very fast.  Easy to install.  Love the wiring harness which was free.  It even came with a switch and a wiring diagram.  You can’t beat the price!  It was lower than other companies that don’t include the wiring harness and mounting hardware.  These lights are very high quality and the cree LEDs are very bright.  I plan to buy another pair soon.
B00076RLG8|5|Just as advertised.
B00AZM5JH2|5|Its a hat so there isnt much to say about it. It came in quickly and was exactly what it said it was. After it came in I took it to the Lids Store in our mall in town and they were able to put my boyfriends last name on the back above the logo already back there. Now it is my boyfriends favorite hat so I would say Christmas was a success.
B000765MHI|2|Not very user friendly, cigarette lighter plug is light wieght quality, fan is noisy and does not move enough air to make it worthwhile. The clip is too big to be easily attach it to anything in my car...good idea, but needs some improvements
B001GJ3E5C|1|Careful when using this thing. I wanted to clean my car seats and this brush is way to ruff to be scrubbing them with it. I do not recommend using this, it is like using a wire brush.
B00PE59KLG|5|I love this frame! Durable and noticeable.
B00756ZPRK|5|Item as described. Shipped quickly. Good deal
B00KQTH95E|5|easy installation. now it slows the blinking rate on my after market integrated tail-lights without splicing into wires.
B00152RH4O|5|Ordered 4 bags/ 400 pieces total and out of the 400 I had no issues with a one of these. I used them to install a debit card system into about 100 arcade games and never had one bad or loose connection. These worked great.  Thank you.
B00CI42KPO|3|Pricey for what it is. Still puts stress on rear door hinges. Had trouble pulling the lug bolts into place correctly. A little better than stock unit.
B004VNUAYI|5|Fast shipping for not being a prime item. Looks awesome on my lid and Im giving the other one to my buddy as a gift. Great company!
B0097CDOBY|5|They work.  Programming was easy.  Reaches over 80 ' at least. Can't beat the price.  If you don't think so call your dealer and ask what they will charge to get you a new fob AND program it.  Better sit down first.
B009MMMNMA|4|I bought two of these kits to add oil coolers inline with current oil cooler on my 2013 HD ultra w/ 103cu. inch engine. Every part worked as stated except clamps should be larger to fit 1 1/2 inch frame tube.  had to remove lower fairing to have place to mount them. Unable to remount lower fairing until I find large clamps that can be used on 1 1/2 tube. Largest clamp in kits was for 1 1/4 tube frame. I will need to wait until weather warms up to see if the added oil coolers work as I plan for them to work.
B008KP7MIA|5|They are well made and very bright. Shipping was very quick.
B007BH7WC4|4|could use a pipe guard, and need one for the FRONT half which covers down the forks.<br />I have purchased two of these.
B0055E48RC|3|Its ok for the money. Had this mattress before a  couple years ago. Mattress will give ya comfort a year each side. I just flipped quite often.  This is the same mattress  many truck dealerships sell  for its packaged the same with the same pic. Price is good and deliv time was quick
B003ZNXCAE|1|This product is nice looking and good quality. Never fit my 2002 Audi A6. I modified to make it fit with no luck. Amazon needs to check this parts more closely. But when I ordered this product amazon showered it fit.
B000SNBSMI|5|Really like the strength of the elastic hem.
B00GT2FUB2|5|Really really good product. It jumps everything I throw at it. I almost knocked it down a star cause it needs charged more than I was led, then again I use it daily. Stay on top of charging it and you will be amazed.
B0036U3RM4|5|Love this windshield. It was an easy install and so far seems scratch resistant - have been through some heavy overgrowth with lots of brush hitting the windshield. I am careful when cleaning it - use water and microfiber cloth. The vent also works well. There is a gap at the bottom which also allows air in. I have not noticed the dirt swirl issue so I think the vent must help. It's great in the cold weather, rain, and dusty conditions. I have only taken if off once when it was 100.
B0043KK49K|2|I was in the market for some new gloves for airsoft as I wore a hole in the middle finger of my Probike gloves from winding airsoft magazines. Since the Probike gloves were no longer available on Amazon, I found these and thought the leather construction was worth the higher price. When I received the gloves, I found that the stitching on the index finger of the right glove was very crooked, with the inside of the index finger turning the right. Also, the cuff of the right glove was EXTREMELY tight, making it almost impossible to get the glove on. Once on, it fit fine but in the process of forcing the glove on, the stitching of the velcro tab tore. Obviously the quality control is practically non existent, as I've read some other reviews about defective gloves.
B0006Z9SRA|5|Great product works good
B00913FHLE|5|As advertised...
B00B1TNQCS|5|Fits perfectly, cheaper than the dealer.
B000BKEBO0|4|Works well on my rv windows
B000ELVJ4Q|2|the casing was not lined up properly with the support bracket mount hole which meant an added expense of having the case split and rotated 1/3 so everything would line up.  After that issue was dealt with it appears to be working fine.
B00K4SVS2M|3|works
B004TGH8D8|5|I really like this helmet.  It's comfortable and the extra large fits well on my extra large noggin.  To my eyes, the design looks a little less ridiculous and a little more cool in person than it does in pictures.  The lens pictured is not totally correct.  It comes with two lenses - a clear and a smoke, which is tinted very dark.  Personally I prefer the smoke lens because it eliminates the need for me to stuff sunglasses underneath my helmet.  However, on my helmet, it seems like neither of the lenses fit perfectly on the helmet.  Not a big deal, and it's barely noticeable, but it seems like they just don't seat on the helmet 100% properly.  The amount of padding is minimal but it's comfortable nonetheless.  There is no snap button to hold the excess strap length after the helmet is already secured, but there is an elastic loop to tuck it into so it doesn't flap around in the wind.  It's a little difficult to secure with gloves on, but any helmet is.  Ventilation is good, with no whistles.  There is a little plastic nose guard which easily removes. I did remove mine because it makes me feel claustrophobic.  Bottom line: I'm very happy with this helmet, and I'm sure you will be too.  For the price, I can't give it anything other than five stars.
B004J2YSOY|5|Excellent item for the price , compared to other competitors. It works for me! I will add more as the weeks go by....stay tuned!
B000C0UOOU|5|Fit as expected
B005GDZQEG|5|Worked out perfect and was easy to install! Definitely consider the rear lift as a combo is wanting a full lift without compromising  ride quality or mpg
B0084UKD28|5|This Cargo liner fit perfectly in the 2014  Honda CRV. Very thick and sturdy .Just put it in so can't comment on how long it will last but looks well made that it could stand up to the bags we have to carry.
B000XQK0VK|5|I had to use a lil common sense on the install but I passed smog and I'm not broke! THEY ROCK!
B00KYOZH96|5|I love this lil guy. He's been hanging from the rear view mirror in my car for months now. Good vibes from him, and everyone always compliments him :) lol
B004036K8O|5|Love these, very sleek and look great.  Very bright, I have found there to be no issues while using my backup camera and night with the tinted reverse lens.
B00L11HYXI|5|Very bright!
B001P6GONU|5|bueno
B002I713CC|5|Very handy for working around A/C or high voltage DC equipment. High quality working surface and more than adequate insulation on the handles.
B007MVJYEI|5|Perfect fit protoge
B0002MSYF4|5|It is much thicker and coarser than I thought it would be.  Not a bad thing, but I just have to press lighter than I was expecting to.  Still a very nice product and definately worth the .75 cent each price tag.
B005JPGTNI|5|fine
B000J15THO|5|A leaking pinion seal was cause to change out the differential lube on a recently-purchased 2001 RAM 1500 -- the old stuff was replaced with a new Timken 710481 Seal; a Spectre 6809 Differential Cover; a Spicer RD52006 Hi-Po gasket; and 72 ounces of Royal Purple 75-W-140, GL-5 Synthetic Gear Oil.<br />The job went quick and easy, and the results were no leaks -- and a quieter differential, too !<br />The Dodge manual specifies a 75-W-140 synthetic gear oil for TOWING -- and since I had no way to know what was in the diff, I opted for the Purple Stuff with the &#34;built-in&#34; friction modifiers.<br /> The differential is now a lot quiter at freeway  speeds, and there's no sign of any odd noises or leaks.<br /> I would buy Royal Purple again and recommend it to friends.
B0016KH254|5|thank you very much for what i order .
B0024GIVZ4|5|So far so good. It's comfortable and stays tight. Looks good. I've gotten many complements on how it looks. :)
B001Q4YMXA|5|Went on easy and allows use of both hand brakes and my winch control.
B007WMP9J6|5|Great looking, very heavy, looks really cool. A really nice edition for your MB key fob. I would recommend this.
B005EGMHJW|5|As a n00b, I had to look up how to toggle the red lock on the connector, by searching videos online. Once that was out of the way swapped it out in less than 2 minutes. Passed my inspection easily and it looks close enough to the factory model.
B00RUE48H0|1|Beware of this item.  The picture is inaccurate and it won't fit GSX-R 600 2011 and up.
B0001WOLU2|5|This little tool looks like it is very high quality. It also comes with it's own tin gift box, so it's perfect for a stocking stuffer! It folds up to be very small, so it should be easy to carry on a key chain.
B000EJWYOW|5|This is a neat little charger if you want to top off a good battery, but, it's very light weight and I have found that the better chargers are heavier in weight because the internal electrical parts are more \\"Robust\\" to handle higher charge rates and be more durable. sometimes you can tell by the weight that the parts are more \\"Heavy Duty\\" , but not always. I would call this unit a \\"SAMPLE\\".  - also, the terminal clamps are too small to go around a top post, they barely bite onto post.  ADDED 12-29-12 --- I have two of these chargers, I have used them now for 4 years and the only problem is when you first plug them in, the cooling fan is slow to start and makes  noise, I wait a moment until fan is running at full speed, then I start charge. they are great for a \\"top off charge\\".
B008EWPHZE|2|Left and right not the same brand name
B00C554I9W|3|I got an XL and it is still a little snug on my fingertips. Still enjoy wearing it while riding
B0024ECD2I|5|Yes, it saves having to remove a Teflon plug to drain to drain the tank. Now open petcock drain and close.
B001EMTQMQ|5|Product is great, price is a little high for tailgate only.
B004QHJFTK|5|We purchased this hub assembly for around $50. Relatively easy fix on our Honda Odyssey. Would have been close to $300+ at the mechanic.
B00FSG8224|5|very good light, also very bright. i used them in my toy hauler
B0031BNCSM|5|I used this to install some drag specialties t-bar for a harley.  Worked great and looks good, plus it adds 1 more inch of rise to your handle bars.
B0065FRBZ6|3|It looks strong and has been on a few long rides so far but the cover material bubbled up after it got wet during a ride.
B00603DSGO|1|Would have been nice if it came with some sort of directions...  I ended up buying a different radio that I didn't have to mount and tossed this thing...
B0043SCBD4|5|Good lock. Was very easy to install.  May not be the strongest. But it will do the job.  Good product.
B000ZLSF74|3|Works okay.  The one I received from Amazon was damaged (bristles were flattened on half the brush).  After returning the brush, I found the it (same brand  and model brush) for a much lower price at Walmart.  I gave it another try.,
B0033048FC|1|Only two of the four spark plugs actually matched the sku # on the main box.  Needless to say, it was useless.
B009S31VVW|5|Works perfectly!
B007HRMWDM|4|with a little work and some cutting made this product work ,was just about 2 inches too long had to cut it down to make it fit the seller should give full measurments so that one would be sure that it is the right fit
B003X9VF36|5|This was a good product it arrived in two days. My boyfriend loved it. It's not poorly made it looks just like the picture.
B008D5VHKQ|3|Knob weighs less than stock, about the same size too.. but it will NOT fit the STi shifter.  Returned for refund.
B000C9M7DC|5|Everything went smooth.
B00DSWJXX2|3|Still doesn't keep my finger tips any warmer than my leather gloves.  Wouldn't waste the money.
B00656SMNK|3|Part as described is great and is Geniune OEM product. Problem is there is no install instructions. Its easy where this guys goes in the vehicle, there is a lot of O rings with only a picture to guide you. There are parts that will be stuck in the fuel filter house when installing that they don't tell you. Installing we would come across the O ring locations. My father struggled at times on the install with the included documents and is a ACE master mechanic and works on ford fleet vehicles.Do not attempt if you are a total amateur.
B0016KG72I|5|Installed in on my Chevrolet Traverse 2013.  Fit perfectly.
B00CQ44I42|5|arrived as promised and fit advertised
B003YCKTTI|5|For little more than a buck a piece, you truly cannot go wrong with these. They are well constructed, very durable and absorbent (after you wash them a couple of times).<br />I use them to dry the dishes, my dogs, my hair and also to clean windows. They leave no streaks or fuzzies.<br />Purchased 1 pack of 12 and gave 4 to my daughter who loves them as well.<br />I would purchase them again in a blink.
B000J2KPMC|5|good
B0013G040G|5|Great price for this product.  I put it on my 99 tahoe and not having any other issues with the shifter.
B00DM106MG|5|Very easy replacement and the angel eyes are much brighter and match the color of the xenons. Very inexpensive and good quality.
B005JU5XE4|5|I love these blades...my second set.
B000GZQBEI|2|The suction cups don't hold and the seat slides and just falls off if someone isn't on it. Not very happy with this seat.
B0068G0ETC|5|I was looking for a helmet that has a large shield that goes down all the way to the chin the Nolan N43E was the answer.It fits perfectly and it is very comfortable, the removable chin is very useful specially for people whom they don't like to use a full face helmet.
B0052XI2G4|5|Works perfectly , fits perfect
B009SEKE96|5|Great!
B0009IK5RG|1|Did not include the parts to fit my car.
B004AH4OJC|5|These are quality fuses and work well. Bussmann has been my choice of fuses since the 1960s when I first worked on my cars. This large pack is just what I needed for my RV where they are all 15amp fuses. Some RV stores sell them for almost $3.00 each.
B0017H9N4E|3|I had really high hopes for this cargo hauler compared to the others (all from China and in multiple pieces that you have to put together).  Compared to the others available, I would order it again, but there are improvements that could and should be made.  With better craftsmanship, I would have rated 5 stars, but quality of work is lower than I expected, so can only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Made in USA<br /><br />All Aluminum, even the main bar that connects to vehicle, unlike others that have an aluminum basket, but the main bar is steel.<br />One piece, welded, so no assembly required and no bolts to loosen and fall out over time.<br /><br />Looks sharp with the diamond-plate pattern in the basket (except as noted below).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Packaging - It is just stuck in a flimsy cardboard box with no protective material whatsoever.  Mine was not damaged, but could easily be dented/damaged if not delivered carefully.  Box had several holes and tears in it.<br /><br />Attention to detail - I was expecting more from an American-made product.  While it is solid, it's clear that whomever built it did not take pride in their work.  Many of the welds look like they were done by a beginner, the plates at the bottom of the basket are not evenly spaced on one side, the rivets holding the logo sign on are uneven, and the aluminum is all scratched up.  The integrity of the hauler is not compromised, but the visual appeal suffers.  Craftsmanship that I would expect from a cheaper imported option, not a premium American product.<br /><br />No reflectors or place to attach lights if desired.  This is not a huge deal, I just bought a pack of stick-on reflectors at the hardware store, but would be nice if it at least reflectors were included like some others have.
B000AMBO9O|1|I have a 2001 Toyota Tacoma.  The engine light came on one day, and I diagnosed it with a diagnosing unit I purchased from Amazon.  The code pointed to a faulty catalytic converter.  I drove 200 miles to another city a few days later and discovered that the light disappeared about half way but later reappeared after my return.  Previously, the light had disappeared for a few miles after using Lucas fuel additive.  I decided to give this product a try after reading about the positive experiences others have had with it.  After receiving it, I added it to a half tank of fuel and drove for about 60 miles.  I kept waiting for the engine light t go off, but it never did and has not disappeared since then.  I noticed that some used two containers to achieve positive results, but I decided not to order another one.
B001DX58KA|5|if you do not learn fast, or have windows(xp+), i would recommend you learn that skill and buy that cd, because this product is worth every cent and more, only draw back is that i'd recommend that you buy a boomslang fic harness for it cutting the stock wires gets tricky if you dont know what your doing... but here's a overview [...]index=11  ps: lot of features,
B006E908IA|5|Could be shinier, and certainly not as shiny as the picture depicts, but it is still very durable. Adds a little spice to my Honda accord sport.
B0040DVL6U|5|This is the second one we have bought.  The first one lasted 10yrs before the plastic clips snapped on one side.  The new version is actually slightly better than the old one.  The difference I see is that before both of the spring loaded clips were connected and moved as one unit.  Because of that the spring was very very tight and it was the force I had to use to re-adjust it caused the upper clip to snap.  On this version the lower spring loaded clips move independently, it seems to be easier to mount.  Angle of view is great.  Would not drive without it.
B000E287Q8|5|Fit and finish is bar none direct replacement utilizing stock airbox.  Slightly disappointing that for how much money this was it only came with the single use oil application.  But im a ragpicking cheapskate....imho it should have come with the big filtercharger kit...ah well still way better then paying the same price for the stock yamaha foam....hope it lasts 20 years like the original lol....should be n o problem ive used kn filter for that long....as long as you clean em properly they will last a lifetime....it is a good idea to have two filters especiallybif you do alot of riding in dirty conditions.  One drying while other installed type of idea.
B008CE0R5E|5|These are heavy duty. Yes, they do smell. But it's not like you are using them for incense or fragrance in the house.
B002DP9W22|5|Hold up OK.
B00FF3AZ9I|4|I have this filter on my 06 Harley Sportster and I love it.  It filters down to 4 microns.  Most filters if you are lucky only filter down to 10 microns.  The chrome is top notch and the ribbed housing is not only functional as a cooler, but it adds a nice and different look to your bike.  The end of the housing has a nut on the end for easy removal.  Installation was fairly simple.  If there is one draw back to this filter, it is getting the replacement cartridge's. J&P cycles used to sell them however the only place I can get them now is through Perf-form products themselves.  My advise would be to order a six pack of cartridge's and you will be set for several years.  The cartridge's are very reasonable, I believe about 6 bucks a piece, so once you get set up it is affordable for a very high grade product.  If you want the best in oil filtration, I highly recommend this filter...  Bill  Kailua Kona, Hawaii
B00PGF3AUQ|5|Loved these
B0054CVBKC|5|I bought a pair of these for my brother and me after reading all available reviews.  We really took our time on this and felt the Sena SMH10 had the best performance reviews out there.  Well...they lived up to it.  These were easy to use, easy to install, and work very well.  Right after installing we went on a 1.5 hour ride and chatted the entire time.  They worked flawlessly.  A few weeks later I rode to Deals Gap (about 1000 miles round trip, riding at least 6 hrs a day) and listened to Pandora on my iPhone the entire time.  I charged my unit every night and never had a problem.  They definitely will outlast an iPhone battery.  We were very realistic about what we were getting and knew that this was not a Bose system so we felt the sound quality was about as good as you could expect for such a device.  Plenty of volume and easy to control even while riding.  One modification I made was to make an incision on the back of the helmet pads next to my ears large enough to insert the speakers.  I positioned the speakers inside the pads but in front of the foam so that they sit snuggly against my ears.  After a few adjustments I now have them in the \\"sweet spot\\" and have great sound without the worries that the Velcro will let go allowing the speaker to dangle from my helmet.  I don't usually take the time to write reveiws but in this case they helped me make a good choice so I figured I should return the favor.    The only disapointment I had was my own fault.  I thought this was the new model with the usb connection.  It wasn't.  I should have spoken with the vendor but was in a hurry to get them before my long ride.  Even so, we still liked them too much to send them back.    Bill
B0016L52PU|1|This item does not work.  It wouldn't even turn on.  I added batteries and plugged it  in.  Piece of junk and a total waste of money.
B00D2W4PEU|5|This is the same exact bearing that you will get from Honda. Price is much cheaper here than most Honda dealers (even the online discount dealers). Used it on a  97 accord wagon. Believe it fits 90-97 accords but do your own research.
B0046DQTQQ|4|I like it it's what I expected.... I have to check and see if it is legal to put on vehicle, that has been my concern....<br /><br />Thx Machele SCott
B00KWD5OF6|4|Matches my 2001 BMW X5 perfectly.
B00538FR52|5|love it! love it! love it!<br /> when you think about life, it is good to have friends that will back up.
B000DINKPQ|4|Scary when your car horn is not loud enough for anyone close by to hear it.  Really glad I upgraded, other cars & trucks can now hear me honking.  Mounted differently than factory one. Happy with Fiamm products,.
B00DYOVXZ0|4|The product is excellent, however, to purchase a superior application to record logs to diagnose and monitor performance.
B00E3M82XI|5|What can be said.... other than great cabin filter, easy to install, at half dealer cost!
B003VLBPJA|1|I ordered this product for a second time recently.  What I got the second time was much less well made and it was not the product pictured.  It was smaller (4x4 cells instead of 5x5) and had small, poorly constructed metal hooks.  I'm very disappointed.  Do not order this!
B002XLHUQG|5|Very easy to use, reduces van movement very happy with product. Would recommend if your van moves whilst parked up.
B00AKYOTU8|5|The fluid  was exactly what I needed
B00063XX5U|4|Works grate on some of the cv band not on all of them I still don't know how the cutter part work but over all this is good
B00503PTVW|5|It gave my JK a nice growl but it wasn't too much. You can clearly hear it when if you have a heavy foot. But while driving normal it is noticeable but not overbearing.<br /><br />I'll buy another when I buy my next JK. Great product.
B00BR1TO80|1|This &#34;Professional Power Station&#34; is very weak.For flat bike tires and basketballs,  it works fine as an air compressor.That's it. Never has it gone past the first red light of charging itself up. Only had power for a laptop for 2 hours.Could not charge my car's battery. Don't waste your money.  .
B006JEE3KO|2|Just got it yesterday- the fit and finish looks good - connectors are self locking - there seems to be no way to test if it works before installing on the bike - currently Figuring out the cryptic instructions printed in such small font that it's worse than terrible - The English is at best mystifying to understand - No meaningful diagrams or instructions I'm very disappointed with this aspect of my purchase but will start this weekend and see how it goes - will post final review later
B007EF7E62|4|Arrive in few days and works great
B0085FP62Y|5|These mirrors have a great look.<br />They were very easy to install.<br />Simple replacement. It is a good product.<br />I would recommend these mirrors.
B001DKLOOC|5|Has made checking engine misfire problems much easier and accurate. With COP or CNP ignition systems this allows me to check coils quickly if I can get to them. Also works on plug wire systems as well.
B002M35CSS|4|Received the racks and went right to work...a little fuzzy instructions but sorted out....only problem came when one of the existing screws to be removed for new rack placement had a stripped out head....arrrrrgh!!
B007Z32J3Q|3|This product worked for me. The bike is pretty heavy, so I had some concerns while installing the rack as the fixture, the one that connects to the crossbar that is closest to the front wheel, and is the most loaded as it maintains bike's vertical position and support arm - is made of plastic.... This is why I give it 3 star. Hope the manufacturer uses the plastic that withstands the load and doesn't break.<br /><br />It all worked good though. It is noisy, but I can't compare it with other systems.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- lightweight<br />- easy to put the bike on (I have a sedan)<br />- the bike stays pretty secure, just follow all the instructions and use supplied straps.<br />- no need to prepare the bike for installation.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- plastic front crossbar mount point. Think about this if your bike is tall and heavy.<br />- it is generic roof carrier, so installation takes more time (but is still very straightforward) versus the carries compatible with your roof rack system. But you know it before you buy it, so no reason to take stars off.
B000BUTDCA|5|Works really good. I got to a camp ground that only had a 50 amp outlet, it did the job perfect good solid connectors. My motor home is a 30 amp.
B00FO67RYM|2|The picture above indicates that 2 bolts attach the sliders to the vehicle, the shafts and the sliders themselves are not 1 piece construction, they actually require similar bolts to be run through to assemble, that being said my set was either missing the 2 bolts that i believe replace the engine pin or the 2 to assemble the sliders (i have no way of knowing for sure since it DID NOT INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS)<br /><br />This problem aside, the product seems well made and the manufacturer is currently remedying the situation. They have been prompt and professional and i appreciate their customer service
B00368PXJG|5|I have used this switch in multiple cars and it makes a significant difference in coolant temps and is worth every penny.
B00EJX00K4|2|If you are wanting to subtly share with others your interest/citizenship/support/etc. of Ukraine, this works.  However, if you are wanting individuals who are not familiar with the Ukrainian flag to know the above, the football shaped magnet with UA in the middle and UKRAINE on the bottom is much better.
B000C9NYRU|3|This part is a okay replacement part for my electrical system in my 1978 Trans Am restoration project. Good quality, but wrong fan design for a 1978 vehicle
B003SO7B8O|4|the quality is great in this kit .it's just missing a needed proportioning valve.
B009ES619S|5|VERY bright.<br /> Mounted them on my snowblower so I could see ahead of me at night.
B002X9WJ7S|3|I wish I had known that this was the logo for a notorious movie-pirating website before I stuck it on my car. Now everyone thinks I'm a different sort of pirate entirely!
B002PUSUAK|3|I bought this for my friend who is a big Raiders fan. It came in a beat up bag and it is a generic utility mat with the Raiders logo/ insert  adhered in the center. The mat I received wasn't damaged but the Raiders insert had a bubble in it like it hadn't been glued? down properly. One star off for packaging and another for qualty control. I would buy for myself since it's only a mat, but as a gift I would have to think twice.
B008FRB2DE|5|These things are stout. I probably should have ordered the thinner version for the project I was working on but these more than did the job. My little sport 4 wheeler now sports a brand new custom set of widened fenders. Not much of a mud bog rider so when checking out the scenery or hunting these additions will keep me and my equipment high, dry and a lot less gooey.
B0009GVUG8|5|This was an excellent replacement for the failed OEM components used in the ZapTruck XL (Chinese-manufactured mini-truck) in my employer's fleet.  Rostra does offer this kit on their website, but Amazon sells it at a lower price.
B003JH9NLS|5|Bought this mat for my 2013 Honda CR-V. Required a bit of trimming to get a good fit but well worth the $ savings. The mat is much heavier than the OEM Honda cargo mat and matches the gray interior nicely.
B0029TQDLA|5|great product for low price!
B00KYYMMM6|5|good dill
B00KPZI7HI|5|Girly, classy and sexy.
B00JMR6JGG|2|does not fit the contour of the car properly , will probably have to return it.  Notified JSP about the problem , they took care of it right away. Thanks for the quick service!
B001KQF6PC|1|does not work after 2 months. And only drive my truck once a week if that.
B004YIVYCM|5|I installed this muffler on a 600 cat. I am very impressed with the quality of this muffler!  it really helped with the drone. I am very pleased with this purchase,  thank you.
B0050DWBJA|4|Update: Contacted Goal Zero and they are sending me an adapter.  Hope it gets here in time for my trip.  But they were friendly and fast, so a huge plus.<br />Original: Just received my order. I purchased this one based on the comment from the Goal Zero person that these should come with the adapter.  I got the batteries, but no adapter was included.  I guess I'll contact Goal Zero to see if they can help out.
B005G21JP2|5|perfect replacement, my steps working good as new.
B000KBGBUW|5|It did everything I wanted it to do. The only downside is that if there is liquid in there, you still have to put a towel or something in there to soak it up and keep it from getting all over your pants!
B002P8EMK4|5|Perfect fit . works great and a fraction of what it cost at the dealer .
B0002MAHL8|5|Super white and good quality.  No complaints here.  Had it for about 1.5 years and it still works strong.  Good price too.
B00PVB4EMI|5|Looks great on my truck speedy delivery and great price!!!
B00NM8TRQK|4|Good except bolts rust.
B00CQAAATI|4|Great item - some of the inner stuffing came out - but not much. Very comfortable and works for its purpose. I don't know why I didn't get one sooner!
B008H3EPC6|4|Great looking steps, but if installing on Diesel truck with the Diesel Exhaust Fluid tank, you must drill two holes for the modified bracket. The directions aren't the greatest either, but took me only about 3 hours and3 broken drill bits to install.
B00KAKG43C|4|I  give it an okay as I bought 3 of these at one time in September 2014 and now one of them has gone bad. The issue is I cannot fine any way to contact the seller and return the item under warranty. Has a 5 year warranty .  Not an easy process. If anyone out there has any ideas that would be great.
B004QUBZ9A|1|Didn't fit my snowblower well despite supposedly being compatible, fell off and lost one of the chains on the first use.
B000M5Y72A|5|The light output is brighter, whiter, and casts a beam further than OEM by a long shot. I have used these in previous vehicles and have not had a shorter life span as suggested on the Sylvania packaging. Well worth the money.
B004YZEJ22|4|Perfect for what I was looking for, bigger than what I wanted but have enough hooks to make it work.
B001UG8S8O|4|looks good on my truck, easy to install, does not come with batteries, just ran out of words to finish this review
B000C5G5PM|4|Large selection in kit to chose from I could not find a perfect match to what was originally installed but I found one close enough to get the job done.
B005HBSUWC|5|Best way to thug out. I highly recommend these if you want your car to perform better, look better, and get you some really sketchy women.
B0009N30EQ|2|Too small for truck visor, velcro straps don't reach around.
B00A740VQM|5|love it very nicely built and a great price
B003LT196G|5|Really good! Much brighter than the stock fogs that I had. Not as bright as true HIDs but well worth the price.
B004W5TJME|4|I bought these to replace Tail Lights for a 1997 Ford F-250 manufactured after 08/96, and they fit perfectly.  The only complaint I would make is the plastic cover they put over the light assembly holes is a pain to get off and rips off wierd.
B004LX9W9C|5|What you see is what you get. Fits and makes your bike look good.
B005GL8DFC|4|A good low cost car cover.  It fits the Miata well, is easily installed and removed.
B005G1WOZC|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT, A++++++,Good product, good for the price, it is recommended, it is plastic, lightweight, 3m tape brings, and the mesh is tough for a small car that fits very well.
B00ID94XCG|5|Excellent product shipped fast also
B000C8T7ZO|4|The part worked great after some massaging of the hole pattern to fit properly. The application wasn't 100% correct, so it may fit better following the parts guide, say a chevy 350 instead of my chevy big block. It did the trick and my motorhome is back on the road. Thanks Amazon.com.
B007ZDDUCK|4|This is a very nice leather milk that smells like Amaretto. It leaves no greasy or waxy feel on my boots, and the sponge that comes with is very handy. However, they need to improve the bottle. It fell on the floor and stayed like that for a day, after which I saw that a large amount of the product leaked. At first I thought that this flat bottle would be very convenient to pack when I travel, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Also, if it leaks, then it's not airtight, so this might affect the way it stores. For a product with this kind of price tag packaging should be impeccable, so I strongly recommend to improve it.
B00DE04Y0A|5|I love it!
B009T9D5CI|3|gets air bubbles very easy sticks good on flat surfaces but does not stick on curves does not stretch very well u hardy feel the texture on the vinyl feels almost smooth will i buy it again maybe
B002N5PQOA|1|The ceramic gasket disintegrate eventually making the clamp ineffective to control fumes and noise. The clip also is easily bent which causes the clamp to loosen.
B001HM0PP0|5|This system was a direct bolt on for my '84 Z28, took maybe 3 hours to get my old system off, new one on and fitted correctly.. all in my driveway. Comes with EVERYTHING you need to install it. I should note that this was my first exhaust system I've ever installed and it went together super easy.
B005FKRA3K|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B000EQCU94|5|OE equivalent for a 2003-2008 Toyota Corolla with slightly different valving. No complaints so far.<br /><br />These are slightly more firm than the stock ride from the KYB's but much softer than the Chinese Sensen variant which failed on me previously (avoid). So far so good. I think for the price these are the ones to get assuming they hold up over time. Build quality seems good. Comes with a beefy 22 mm top nut. The ones I got also came with an additional plastic cover over the seal on top that is exposed in the pictures on Amazon.<br /><br />Buy the Monroe 72114 and 72115 struts as a pair. I also recommend getting OEM bellows/insulators (it's a one-piece design) from Toyota if it's your first time replacing your struts, and the Monroe 906936 lower insulators.
B00MST15KA|5|Nice item.  Good seller.
B0075JYPNM|5|Great customer service, good quality decal and all about customer satisfaction!
B007Y52USO|4|This shade works really well for my 2012 Ford Focus hatchback. It definitely covers like 99% of the windshield. The material is really heavy, and seems to insulate really well. My only complaints are that it is really awkward to try and roll up. It really needs to have some kind of creases or something manufactured into it to help make it easier to roll. Sometimes I can't roll it small enough for the Velcro strap to wrap around it, and then I have to unroll/reroll again once or twice. It would be extremely awkward to do inside the car if you have a front seat passenger, too.
B00L2LTS4A|5|Very good quality
B009M3PQFA|5|best charger in the world for the best batteries in the world!
B00ESTFM8Y|5|A reliable, well made oil filter that runs at a much better value here on Amazon than it does in any stores near me. Certainly goes a long way when you do your own oil and don't spend ridiculous money on having an oil change.<br /><br />My only word of caution is make sure this filter works for your specific car. It may be a close model, but may not actually be the one you need.<br /><br />5 Changed Stars out of 5!
B004PC4AXC|2|Says they're made to fit 06 S83 but when I went to put them on they are smaller hole to screw cover to turn signal didn't line up. I wsn't gonna waste more time and money sending them back for the cost so had to force the screw in at an angle so temp fix for now.
B006LB9FFI|5|Great product to have, I need it for my 240Z. Everything else didn't do the job.  This product targeted my need.
B009K8KR10|5|I have had this for awhile now, use on weekends no problems. only advice is to install stainless nuts and bolts, the ones that came with it started rusting after 3 months. extremely bright.
B000I04Z7Q|5|This kit is very easy to install and is defiantly worth the money. You can watch their installation videos on YouTube
B00AM3I12O|5|Fit is perfect.  Price was reasonable.
B00SWBSLEG|1|They don't work for correcting your canbus issues as advertised
B005FJ69ZQ|5|This shirt is so light weight and a stunning design.  Love the quality of the print and material. It is worth every cent
B000C2SBI4|4|A little thicker than OEM...which is good, except the OEM hose clamps are *barely* able to fit.  I should probably swap them out with new, slightly-larger ones, since I think they're hanging on by like two threads.
B00KTHUSJ2|1|Did not match my vehicle and was unable yo use it
B0013TNFEA|5|Hard to find plug at a great price! Much cheaper than plugs from Lowe's or Home Depot that are the equivalent to Champion.
B001PV1UK2|5|Don't worry that this keychain will be too large - it is the size of a key in length, so it will fit in your pocket.<br />My son thinks his Jeep has &#34;brass balls&#34; so that's why he wanted it!<br />It is well made and the mold is very detailed.<br />Just a cool, fun piece for a young guy!
B000QGJT4G|3|they work nice,the bottoms should be polished chrome,and the pegs that i removed has a cover, that covers a weld on the saddle bag bars on my stratoliner that cant be reinstalled so the welds are now exposed
B0063L1JO6|1|Poorly designed. Would not fit my vents.
B001C90VVQ|5|This will be my second set of EBC Yellowstuff Brake Pads for my Matrix/Vibe. With the first set at end life, I figured it would be a good time to write a review. Preventing the front wheels from getting too wily are a set of Ate PremiumOne rotors, stainless steel brake lines and EBC Yellowstuff pads. Making sure the rear wheels don't forget they have some work to do, sometimes, is a set of bone stock drum brakes with stainless steel brake lines. I also have Ate DOT 4 Super Blue Racing brake fluid throughout and run Kumho Ecsta SPTs. The set up is about 4 years old and has approximately 60,000 less than kind miles on it. I am, to put it kindly, heavy on the pedals and I live in an environment sufficiently urban enough to sprout the off 10+ story building when I am not looking.<br /><br />Now, the pads. Their performance has never been less than adequate and has mostly been astounding. A cold stop on the freeway will not render ones eyeballs from their sockets, but a 'warmed' stop on the freeway most certainly will. Brake fade is nearly non-existent in all situations. Even attempts to overheat the braking system were thoroughly thwarted at every application. The pads did not seem to have any issues with climactic conditions - especially during the days of dampness that can occasion living on the gulf coast. Break in was a somewhat tedious process, but well worth the effort. For the vast majority of the pad's life they were silent, albeit a little dustier than I like. The odd squeak and squawk did occur when the pads were cold; they are racing pads after all. Ah, but what about actual braking performance, as in stopping distance - wonders the performance enthusiast?<br /><br />Well, I never measured a thing about it. The brakes were quick to respond and it always felt like it was stopping sooner than stock. Once hot, they bit off the bat and never let go - ever. Do I think my stop distances are shorter with this set up? You bet. Can I prove it, not all.<br /><br />All in all, I am exceedingly pleased with these brake pads and am glad to be putting another set on my car. So pleased with this company, to boot, I went with rotors from them this time.eased with these brake pads and am glad to be putting another set on my car.

B001RB0P1K|5|Good size and quality. Good price and fast shipping
B00ABA0Z0Y|5|Great product. Fast shipping
B00D9C2CDO|5|This product is incredible for the price.  Went on a 7 hour trip with lots of rain and everything remained dry. Made sure the straps were real tight to the roof rails and no problems.
B000LEU8A2|5|I don't usually write reviews, but I actually enjoy this product. It only took me a minute, if not less than that to set it up. You have to move quickly thought as the dust and lints quickly set on display after you wipe it spotless before applying the screen protector. If you align it well, it basically sets on the display by itself. Very happy with it. The package contained 3 screen protectors, I already used one for me and one fory wife and still have a spare one. If you buy a screen protector from a phone carrier, you will pay 3 times more for the same thing. This price, unbeatable.
B002ZWFUX8|5|This is a great product - very simple in concept, but it does the job.  The customer service is outstanding ( they will contact you to make sure the product matches your vehicle).
B007NIYA4Y|5|A++++++
B002732CY0|4|THEY DO NOT FIT FLUSH. THERE IS A NOTICEABLE GAP AND A LOT OF FORCE HAD TO GO INTO PUTTIN THEM IN. WAS IT WORTH THE HEADACHE....NO. DID THEY LOOK GOOD....YES. BE READY TO WORK A LITTE. DEF NOT A SNAP AND GO DEAL. GET YOUR TOOLS READY.
B00DNX92TQ|5|Awesome bag and slaps right on the tank with magnets no need for straps
B000VVVJWQ|5|There is another Amazon listing for this same starter. Check here to see which one has the cheaper price:  [[ASIN:B000PDGIQ2 Powermaster 9503 XS]]. For some stupid reason, Amazon refuses to merge the two listings.  This is a great starter by the way! I had to re-clock it but that was about it! If the manufacturer is listening, please include a terminal shorting kit so we don't have to fabricate our own. It is simple and cheap to make!
B00AV9EBIM|4|Good quality.
B000C5UFK8|5|perfect fit, works good, I was not throwing any codes so it was not having issues, but did notice a smoother idle with it in place. However I also changed all the filters at the same time
B002RLFV72|5|A good quality water pump for my old GMC Van.  This should last much longer than the &#34;Lifetime Warranty&#34; parts store replacements that seem to last no more than two years.
B004PXWKLA|1|Glue on honda symbol was no good
B001UALIW8|2|used after menz 400 and left paint sticky and not much more shine.  I'll stick to glare micro shine or spider.  definite waste of money
B000C9S7E0|5|Great parts! Would highly recommend! My husband was a GM rep and we always tried AcDelco parts on our vehicles first.<br />We would highly recommend!
B00142V66A|4|I recently bought these but like another person who wrote a review, I got the wrong set sent to me. I have the gas tank lid cut out on mine when I don't need it to be. Other than that, installation was pretty easy. I have a Rough Country 7.5 in lift that I am preparing to install and will be putting 35s on. I will let everyone know how it all fits with this set of fender flares.
B000E8T81U|3|orange paint came off and attached on the gasket. You need to clean it before install to the engine, the paint may get into the engine oil.
B004J56M2C|3|It didnt look anything lile the photo. It was a day past the guarantee date getting to me.
B000NCNB92|1|Merely plugging it in and my alarm, locking system, dome/trunk lights, taillights, and front parking/running lights all shorted out!  Tossed this piece of s*** and will report seller and request compensation for damage to my car.  Took me 3 days to get back on the road.
B000NPUMGO|5|Perfect! Tksss
B008H08LQU|5|Still putting them in but they work great
B00PKJQXFM|1|I was disappointed with this product. The magnet isn't strong enough.
B001HMUTS8|5|I was concerned about buying this item because I had already received an incorrect radiator from a local parts dealer. It had different transmission cooler connections and no barb fitting for the coolant tank. I did not want to pay the dealer's price so I researched this one. It appeared to be the same as what is sold through several online Volvo parts dealers and recommended on several forums. I was concerned because you cannot always trust the accuracy of product photos and I could not get a parts number match against our car from the manufacturer. I decided to take a chance because it was about $60 cheaper then the online Volvo parts dealers. Turned out to be a perfect fit for our 1999 V70 non-turbo with all the correct connections. You will have to buy or reuse the rubber isolators used at the mount points and the metal nut clips use to attach the shroud and condenser. Be sure to transfer these before you put it into the engine compartment. I would also recommend getting the thermal shrink hose clamps. The lower hose connection is known to be tough to get clamped without leaking, as mine was. The shrink fit clamps have good reviews on solving this problem.
B00JH1IUFA|5|This part worked great replacing the a/c clutch on my 2006 Nissan Altima 2.5L.  The changing of the clutch was fairly simple, but preparing the area by removing drive belt, wheel well, etc. makes it a little time consuming.  This was the first time i'd ever changed an a/c clutch.  After doing electrical testing, i narrowed it down to the clutch<br /><br />I recommend an a/c clutch holding tool (about $7) to install.  The original clutch does not have the necessary holes for holding tool to work, so i just used channel locks to hold the pully.  The new clutch comes with a new pulley assembly, so no need to re-use the old one so damage was not a concern.  The tool will help avoid damage to the new pulley<br /><br />One thing to note is that this comes with 4 or spacers that look like washers.  They are not washers!  don't put them on the bolts that hold the assembly on.  The are spacers to allow for the appropriate gap for the clutch to disengage.<br /><br />I've used it all summer (2014) and it's working well.  No issues.
B0055B0XA6|5|Quick easy fix right part first time thanks
B005J6JRMM|1|doesn't work -does not fit all makes and models
B000SNK7HK|5|Fast shipping, lovely product. Love it! Thanks.
B008XIQ5KA|5|My son loved the set.  He used it several times on Christmas day to open taped boxes.  He said he would keep it in his car.
B005JUX1S4|5|Installed this on my 2011 Ford F150.<br /><br />Installation was relatively simple, once I was able to find an ignition switched power source in the truck...  The pump works perfectly and makes using the air bags MUCH easier than having to manually fill them.  It is a little noisy, but that was expected.  Wireless controller is straight forward and very easy to use.
B0022ZGLEA|5|Installed on 2011 Polaris RZR-S. Good quality, sturdy, excellent fit, would definitely buy again.  Need to add 3 more words: go for it...
B00NIMFTOE|1|Bought two of these. Neither worked.<br /><br />Typical China junk.
B0048J01RG|5|This window regulator assembly was shipped promptly , arrived in good condition ,everything I needed including directions were in the box .All in all I was completely satisfied with this purchase. It is a lousy difficult job ,but that's the choice I have made twice . saved a bunch by doing it myself.  LARRY AUNGST
B002IWYFVS|5|Fast service.  Just as described.  Marine friend loved it.
B007Y87UYK|5|Great alternator!  With the help of YouTube. I replaced this alternator and a belt tensioner pulley (Gates 38191 Belt Tensioner Assembly - also ordered from Amazon) on my 2001 7.3L Ford Excursion.  Saved about $400.00 in the process!  I've had it in place for the past week and my Powerstroke is running like a top.  It starts right up with the batteries fully juiced.
B000F0E8FS|5|11/24/13. Works perfectly.  My Troy-built Blower-Vac. would not continue to run and ole spark plug was failing.  This new one was a perfect manufacturer recommended replacement and did the job.  It runs well now.
B003RWJ1ZS|5|Great
B00080QHMM|5|Accurate and works perfectly
B001TZP0FA|5|I ordered a condenser from the local auto part store but when it came in it looked bad and besides was not the right one.<br />I decided to stop wasting my time and look for an OEM part.<br />I ordered this one from Amazon and had it in 2 days with free shipping!<br />It fit perfectly and works great.<br />I highly recommend this part.
B00MOS6TQA|1|I guess the light have to be installed in side your truck, that is how short the wires are,
B004UM6DLE|5|This product worked great.  Removed the rust spots from the rail dust on my new car.  Search youtube to see this product in action, it worked the same on my vehicle!
B000FW2NMQ|5|I love when a friend of mine says that putting slime in their tire adds weight. My reply is when you are carrying zero body fat and look like Lance Armstrong, then you worry about weight. Slime keeps you riding when you hit a thorn on a trail and you are 5 miles away from anything. The gallon jug has lasted through many a tire. In fact, I have ridden 7000 miles on my Serfas tires with Slime. I have had 7 punctures during that time and kept riding. All it takes is one flat out on a long distance ride to make the ounces of extra weight well worth it. Keep riding!<br /><br />Let me add, that when you get a puncture, if all the air seeps out, you will have a flat. Slime does not replace the air. Remove the thorn or what caused the puncture, then fill the tire back up. If the puncture is too big, you will need to replace the tube. However, I have had 3 flats while riding. My air pressure when from 70 psi to about 35 psi. I was able to keep riding until I could add air in my tire.
B0030DM72S|5|This works so well i had no idea what i was missing. I never knew the hatch would lift on its own. Buy these in pairs and you won't be sorry.
B001GJ3DZS|5|I have a new Explorer with polished aluminum wheels as well as an F150 with aftermarket wheels and I always dreaded cleaning the brake dust off the wheels. It was never an easy process, and the hard plactic brushes do not get in the areas where you can get it off, and I don't want to damage the wheels.<br /><br />I happened to see this brush on Amazon and it looked relatively inexpensive and the brand was right so I took a chance. Now when I wash my cars, I spray wheel cleaner on the wheels, wash the car from the top down and then brush and rinse the wheels. This handy little brush with the soft bristles is awesome. It gets to all the little curves and crevases and is easy to hose off.<br /><br />It may not seem like a 'must have', but if you enjoy cleaning your vehicles like I do, it saves minutes which add up and you don't have to worry about it damaging your nice wheels.
B000CAO7XO|4|The velcro is nice and I'm glad to have both pockets on one side. My boyfriend uses it.all the time.
B0036VRQ70|5|Had a leaking head gasket, figured I would try it out after being recommended by a mechanic (friend of a friend). And surprisingly it worked out great. Drove the truck around for over a year until  I found something else.<br /><br />I would for surely buy this stuff again in the future if need be without a second thought!!
B0093WAJ02|4|Very cool and useful little tool to get at bolts in difficult places. Only used it twice so far, so I can't attest to the durability.
B009EQBVV8|5|Easy to install and work great
B000BRJUTO|5|Very easy to install. All common tools, great instructions easy to follow. Great ventilation without the worry of rain entry. Makes my fantastic fan complete.
B002LGZRCW|5|Great aftermarket wheel cover replacements. Look as good or better than the factory and the whole set is less than ONE factory replacement.
B00IKW3UOS|5|Yes it was just what I expected!
B0061XTELG|5|Purchased this product and had no issues with the installation or operation. It works perfectly. I would recommend this to everyone. The arms are very strong.
B005M4GC74|5|Perfect, fits my 05 Toyota Matrix exactly, so its a great replacement for the one that was stolen from my car.  Hopefully this one will stay put.
B000CS7P1M|4|I had an older Schumacher portable jump-starter (The Mini Mite) and the batter just would not hold a charge anymore. I purchased this one because of the convinience of the charging tray and the larger capacity. I rarely use it for jump starting, but my wife uses it all the time when she takes or dog our for training. She uses it to powe 12 volt box fans via the socket on the front. It works great and will power the fans for hours to keep our dog cool in his crate in the SUV. (In case anybody is concerned, in between traing sessions when he is in the car, the tailgate and all the windows are wide open) The only issue I have run into is that when having to jump start a vehicle, there is a relay system to prevent connecting the cables to the wrong polarity. BUT, it the battery is TOTALLY dead, it won't trigger the relay to connect the battery pack to the cables. The battery you are jump starting must have some voltage in it, and there is no way to bypass this function. Other than that, it is a great product.
B00CXN29OW|5|Keep small things organised in the car!
B00068XCQU|5|This Deltran Battery Tender is small, very simple to use and quiet, does not make hummimg noise like my old battery charger did.  Also very happy I am able to leave this charger plugged in indefinitely and not have to worry about overcharging battery. Quality item at a reasonable price!
B009F0EEOO|2|not the right part..refuned.
B0037YKLB4|5|exactly what we needed
B006TMKDIM|4|Nice price and nearly identical to the OE unit.
B000COB65M|5|awsome fit
B00ENO6OEU|5|Perfect
B00MLW6JE6|5|Keeps my car smelling fresh.
B003ERU8VW|1|Not happy at all. You can't remove it when the weather turns cold because it will have shrunk and you will not be able to get it back on until the sun comes out.  The plastic corners on the back both broke within 6 months. On the 12 month the back rail flew off while going down the expressway and I am now done with it.
B001G4TV6S|5|My wife goes to horse shows and the trailer is a mobile store, the lock is easy to install and I don't think you could get it off without destroying the coupler. It's a good deturement
B001GMTKM0|5|Ad said it was slightly damaged. I found it was only a damaged box. Hitch was brand spanking new and undamaged.
B004LWV0GQ|5|Husband bought this for the battery recharger....it has been a big help in charging the lawnmower  and even my truck that was having issues for some reason....
B00C5RB03W|5|These grab the bumper better than what came with the RV, and the holes are smaller than the one big finger sized hole in the old ones.
B000C2CKF4|4|Fit perfect Thanks
B0043SCBD4|5|Secures the tailgate so you don't have to worry that someone will take it especially since it has the backup camera in the tailgate as well.
B000EBONYO|5|Love the Dolphin shades.  The grandkids love the Dolphin with the light shining through them.<br />I have had it for years and it still looks good.<br />I would and will buy it again.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Wow what can I say, this battery weighs next to nothing, it has 4 terminals to make hooking it up easy. It was packaged well and was delivered quickly. At first I thought it was a joke like they sent me a fake demo battery by mistake but its no joke this battery is light and powerful, I installed it on a 1985 Honda Magna no problems besides a slight modification for a smaller battery but man it is so worth the extra bucks if you need a battery for your bike.
B009XVEF12|5|Great product I got it 2nd day after o order it  Works really good !!  \\" I recommend it \\"
B000CQRK2S|3|These brake pads do not have the correct center pin length for my Toyota Sienna application. The pin is too short to install the clip. However, I installed them anyway and they are working fine, even though the center pin is not secured with the C-clip.
B002J8LMVC|5|I have owned 2 other jump starters over the years, but I've always had the problem of leaving them plugged only to have ruined them because of overcharging, so I have some experience using these kinds of units. I bought this unit almost a year ago and it has worked flawlessly! I charged it up when it arrived and didn't use it until maybe a month or so later when my Honda Odyssey's battery was dead (kids left the cabin lights on). It started the van right up no problems. Since then I have used it probably every couple months for myself or friends. One week we went camping with a few other families and the kids once again left the lights on in their respective vans. This thing started 3 vans right in a row without recharging. I say that is quality!<br /><br />#UPDATE<br />This starter is still going strong over 3 years later, granted I only use it maybe 4-5 times per year, but it's always there and ready when I need it. I may charge it about 2 to 3 times a year.
B0086CPGBM|5|They did. It's true! And now the world, or at least the guy tailgating me knows about it.
B00E3W7Q1C|5|needed some more tape on back but look good,
B007RHX22W|5|This was cheap, highly recommended.
B000BDAXVM|5|I want to dispel something right quick -- there was a review left about this item saying that the mats are too large for the vehicle. I own a extended-cab, and I had no trouble getting these mats to fit. All I did was follow the instructions on the Husky Liner site telling customers that they may need to trim their mats to get them to fit. After a good trimming, these things fit and look awesome.
B002PQW6NG|5|Super easy to install after I finally figured that I had to pull the red tabs up to dis engage the corded light plugs!! Made the car look brand new and for half the price Volvo wanted! I've been using them for a few months now and no issues at all
B001BK675U|5|I purchase for de power non-heated mirror and this sensor and I received de mirrors but  I have not received the sensor
B00BMU93O6|3|They look nice
B000BRUYSK|3|I'm not sure it is needed. I used it for a RX7 rotary engine and the Shop Manual just calls for vaseline.
B003UNPAVS|3|Not the best quality for the price
B001AHTVV6|5|Thank you for the fast service! The floor mat is MUCH cuter in person! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
B006570LGU|3|Product arrived fast which was nice. However... Picture shown is for Suzuki and NOT a Honda. Part number 85155 is correct and received the correct part for my machine. Quality seems solid and all parts were included to mount. Just wish the picture was proper..
B0009JB7GI|5|Excellent
B003AZDLAI|5|grandson loved it. just what the kids like these days.
B001ADBV18|5|product fit well and was easy to install and well made.
B00DSR48NC|5|I was afraid of it being too tacky but they look great in an all black interior
B00BEN3K6I|5|I loved the spindles only had to adjust brake lines and dust shields but direct fit to my s10 truck
B007ZDNMDW|5|Very weighty shifter.<br />Solid construction, great hand feel, helps with shifting.<br />It does get cold in the winter, I wear gloves.
B005M1AVFQ|5|My wife recently got a new Samsung Galaxy S3 so I loaded the free OBD app and bought this very reasonably priced Scanner just to have one. Works like a charm! Very cool. All I need now is a legitimate &#34;check engine light&#34; cuz' I'm ready.
B00H2XC358|1|I need info on how to return this.  Used it once and it didn't work at all but did successfully imbed my brand new tires tread right into the grooves of the orange plastic!
B00B75ZDZ4|4|They fit quite well and were fairly easy to install with the seats out of the car.  They don't completely cover the sides of the bottom cushion but that is pretty much unnoticeable with the seats in the car.  They look very nice indeed and have no wear after two years.  The only complaint is that they are very sweaty in warm weather - I have to cover them with a cloth seat cover in the summer unless I want to arrive at work with a soaking wet back!<br /><br />(Note that I have Miata seats in an old British sports car so no AC.)
B00EGDX5JK|5|Love this Star Trek decal.
B000BNMOKK|2|Cord wasn't long enough and light wasn't exactly what was required for postal job safety
B003ZWJBLE|5|Fits and works perfectly.
B00M7EL30S|2|didnt really help alot for the money I would not buy it again
B004M09N0C|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted.
B0022ZR3O2|5|Excellent purchase, easy to use, easy to fit on difficult stems, nice length of swivel hose, cloth covered hose, easy to read, convenient reading release button (reading is held after release from stem). Highly recommended.
B009KNLV5G|3|The shipping time was excelent but I believe that the part  was bad. I compare the pack with others and it was way better, price and the life exceed
B001KZDG0K|3|Not recommended.  Sub-par fuel level sender.<br /><br />I bought this assembly rather than just a pump repair kit {pump and sock} because my car was still running, pump was just noisy, and I didnt want to bother leaving the car torn down,  while chasing other parts that might need chasing.<br /><br />Big Mistake.  The pump seems to work fine but, on looking at the fuel level sensing assembly, I thought it was cheap and not very reliable looking.  I considered actually just swapping the pump parts and putting the old assy back.<br /><br />I should have done that.  The fuel levels seems to go in 1/8 increments.. one minute almost to E,  the next, almost to 1/4 level.  It's pretty frustrating.. I will have to drop the exhaust and fuel tank, after running it to empty to fix this.<br />If you buy this, use it for parts as I should have, or..<br />Buy the pump rebuild kit from Bosch instead.<br /><br />You may need to get a sock-filter at your local auto parts store.<br /><br />I gave it three stars only because the pump is quiet and everything needed to install was included.<br />Added:  And after six months, the pump was no longer 'quiet' either.  After 13 months, 25,000 miles pump still running but suspect it wont last another 25k.
B000BYB8HE|5|Fast shipping.  Received as advertised.
B0017R5EQK|5|im a 4yr auto tech. i use this at work and on side jobs. fast reading ( fast = less then 1 sec. ) ive used his tool for 3yrs now. good buy.
B007H2RR78|1|Used this one time and the end fell off. Not worth the hype
B000COTKDM|2|It has to fit over a hitch ball and it only winds in, not out.  You have to release the line clutch to get it out and that happens with no control.
B00GUF74HQ|4|Installation could have went smother. Inserting the nut into the tailgate was the hardest part. Just be careful not to over tighten.
B005DR0Y3S|5|good deal
B004K27D3G|5|Took it out of the box and laid it in the sun for an hour. Snapped in my channel bar and hooked it all up in 10 minutes. High quality material and nice tight fit.
B0009OMYA6|2|This oxygen sensor socket is okay.  It has a grainy finish and is not particularly nice.  A nicer one could have been found from other brands for less money.  Made in China.
B001HX60NU|5|my daughter is going to love this sticker...Jack Skellington is her FAVORITE character and she starts driving next year...so this will be perfect.
B006WB82UG|5|Love it day and night I can see
B001WZPRPU|2|Did not last long
B008743HV0|5|good
B0099Z4MJ2|4|I ordered this to replace my 530 chain. The tool removed the pin from the chain but the removal pin bent and I had to hammer it out of the tool. The tool did not get damaged just the pin. I was able to bend it back but I am not sure it will hold up to one more removal. As for riveting the chain this worked well and I did not have any issues. I am sending Hoosier Garage an email to get a replacement pin. All in all I would recommend it as the price is right and the main function that I was looking for was the riveting function and I had no issues with it.<br /><br />Video links (copy the URL and replace the &#34;xx&#34; in hxxp with t's so it reads &#34;http&#34; before going to the URL):<br /><br />Chain Breaking Video: hxxp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vhZTQDx8i0<br />Chain Riveting Video: hxxp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gdLWZ9fcQ4
B000BLGPES|5|I ordered these bulbs on a hunch that they would be bright. In fact, they are just as bright as my Sylvania SilverStar headlights that I have on my car.  These fit my 1989 Volvo 740's fog light housings wonderfully.
B001JQTMXU|5|After 30k miles, it was time to clean the filter.  This was the best price/deal around for the cleaning kit for the dry (oil-less) filter.  Sprayed the filter for complete coverage, and let sit for 15 minutes.  Ran under a faucet to clean off, and let air-dry for about 2 hours.  Could tell an instant difference on throttle response, and first tank of fuel shows a 1mpg increase.  There is a lot of cleaner in here, so don't think I'll be needing anymore for a very long time.
B004A6GVGC|4|Very good radiator to replace the original from Suzuki. I replaced mine a week ago and it was a perfect fit working perfectly on my Forenza 2005. The old one cracked on the top and this one was the best fit to get my car running again. As usually happens on replacement parts, I had no problems reinstalling hoses and fittings in this new radiator. It came from manufacturer very well packed and with most of bolts and nuts included on the pack. It does not come with some clips and you will need to reuse your old ones.Also they do not include new sealing washers for the transmission lines. Do not throw away any parts of the old one until you have the new one running. It has one major down side:The female threads for the fluid transmission fluid lines. Threads are aluminum and very weak threads. It is very very easy to get it stripped if you cross one thread or if you get it a little over tight. If you get some transmission fluid leak when testing the new radiator, be careful with those threads. They can be damaged easily. I even suggest you to test these threads screwing your male threaded connectors before install the radiator in place. On my opinion, Sunbelt Radiators should at least make those two threads in brass like the original radiator from Suzuki  is made. Other than these issues Sunbelt is a good and well made radiator. I recommend it.
B000C83NLI|5|Standard is a great brand and Amazon is a great seller and has great prices.<br />My wifes Chevy's location is dificult to reach so I didn't want to have to replace this part again.
B00KLL3R1W|5|Awesome!
B0002NIKFC|5|Awesome!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works fine with the Torque Pro app.  Works with 2014 Honda Accord and 2014 Chevy Sonic.<br /><br />The connector in the Accord was a little touchy.... when the unit was plugged in snugly it didn't work.  No lights.  But when I pulled one corner out slightly it started up.
B0002LBLB4|5|I have used many waxes and this is the best....by far.  When they raised the price, though the roof, I said I wasn't going to buy this stuff anymore.  I still am though.    Excellent deep shine especially on dark colors.  Pretty good durability....an order of magnitude better than most boutique waxes.  Ease of application is great.  The BEST thing about this wax, save for the deep shine, is that it WILL NOT STAIN TRIM.  You can (and I do) wax your trim with this wax.  It does not stain under any circumstances.  Many waxes will stain badly with a residue that is really hard to remove, but this stuff will not.  It makes trim look great, as a matter of fact.    I have tried MANY waxes over the years.  This is the best.  Hands down.  It's worth the ridiculous price.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Light weight, no splinters, easy to see.
B003BKUAVU|5|Purchased for my 2015 F150. Product is great, but please note that wiring to the trailer connections disables the auto start/stop function of the ford eco boost engine. There is an auto detect feature that assumes a trailer is connected since the LED draws voltage. I'm going to try and wire them direct to the taillights and see if that works. Otherwise, love the lights.  Update: removed the taillights and wired directly to those leads. Everything works like a champ now with no issues our impacts.
B00070HCDQ|5|Nice product,easy install,great looks.I would recommend for someone who wants to dress up their truck for a low cost project
B00DWUOYRK|5|Big hit with the young men.
B005EZ0NE4|5|This is a high quality car cover that lives up to its description. I especially enjoy it being personalized with the Fiat logo. The cover is reasonably priced, protects your car, fits perfectly, and, it arrived when promised. Makes you almost happy to pay shipping charges. When I opened the box and saw the product I was pleased.
B002ZWFUX8|5|The perfect simple solution to the Honda Fit's poor sun visors.  These have worked exactly as they should.  My only concern is that they get a little stuck to the visor in hot weather - but I'm not sure if it is the fault of the visor or Visormate.  Either way, they are a great product and essential to safe driving.
B00E6Z3I8G|5|very nice
B00GQ4DTGQ|1|Description states that it will work with iphone... well it will NOT WORK with iphone 5 or iphone 5s with lighting cable.  Maybe it works with older iphones but it will not work with iphone!!!<br /><br />This is the second one I have tried and no luck... but it will charge an Samsung NOTE 2...
B005A7508K|5|These are a perfect fit for my Civic and the color is just right. They work well and protect the rugs.
B00L378NDK|1|This a very poor product and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B0041PQJPA|5|Fits nicely
B002QGZZV0|5|OK, I know installation depends on the vehicle.  Fram is a great brand, and after easy installation, I assume it will improve air flow.
B004SSAFAA|5|Came securely packaged. Great price. Love the color. Works as intended. Thank you.
B004KEJYAY|5|It works good. Would definitely reccomend
B00ESNIZBQ|5|I put the sticker right over the apple symbol so it looks like a moon/sun and every person who I have come in contact with was extremely jealous and/or loved it! Its super easy to apply and the design is lovely.
B00CUREA5C|5|Dries car well.  I bought a second one since I like to wash both cars at once.
B00EE56UAG|4|This is a great way to keep your helmet where it should be. The carabiner itself seems pretty strong, but I know it isn't going to be Fort Knox for your helmet. Nothing is going to be a complete defense from a determined and prepared thief. This will keep idiot opportunists from nabbing my helmet while I'm up on campus.
B00KL3ALGO|5|My aim is to reduce the harmful rays hitting my face through the side window of the car, so I'm hoping this will help.  I have very sensitive skin and need all the sun protection I can get.  I immediately noticed a reduction in the heat coming through the side window.  There is still a degree of glare in my eyes from sun, but not as much as a plain window.  My husband appreciated being able to see through the screen while he was driving.  Love how easy to put up, take down and store.
B00II5YADC|4|Very good. Will buy 2 more. It does what it claims.
B00KCQSM9S|4|For the price you pay, it's pretty decent. Come with nice packaging and has video instruction on how to install. The installation process (especially for the backseat) might be a bit difficult and tricky though. The material might look cheap but they actually hold together pretty well despite decent yanking (as long as you're not being an idiot with your force then you should be fine) ~ My backseat doesn't quite fit perfectly but hey ... look sharper than before :)
B008OYHSYA|5|Much better than the OEM antenna.  Looks good and have had no issues with signal reception.
B0035GQ5S2|5|Installed on a 2012 WRX sedan. Looks great, but like others have stated the passenger front is a couple cm shorter for whatever reason. It's not really noticeable unless you're actually looking for inconsistencies.
B0002S9YKC|5|These are really nice heavy duty brackets and screws. Everything is metal. Nice and bright too. I like them a lot.
B0057GU46M|4|OK  not top quality
B000UKGWR0|4|exactly what I ordered, Great product
B007H9D5OK|5|Starter was excellent!  Had installed a factory purchased starter a year earlier and it had quit just before I purchased this starter.  It never sounded as good as this starter. This one sounded like it should and should run 5 years.
B00D3TB3XS|5|The mud flaps fit perfect, all mounting holes lined up with no problems and installation was a snap.
B000B8N3FU|3|It works, but the key is far too to hard insert! I would buy a non-locking if I had it to do over.
B0057IG09K|5|You get a pair of brake and clutch levers. Cheap and easy replacement for a 2009 Honda CBR. Easy install also.
B000I04Z7Q|5|I ordered this thinking the LED would not be great quality cause of the low price but I was completely wrong !! They work great !!<br /><br />Installation: Unless you plan on hooking your wiring to a power source other than your cigarette lighter, you don't need to purchase anything extra. To place and hold the lights you need either zip ties, Velcro, or simple tape which I used to put the lights in place. Gorilla tape works best since the other tapes would not stick to the interior. It comes with screws to drill holes but that's risky if you ever plan on moving them around. I also bought a 12 volt cigarette adapter to hook the wires up. It's much easier than hooking them up to your battery or whatever and works great. I bought one at Radio Shack for $14.99 cause I was impatient but the makers sell it here for less than $10 so order both the kit and adapter if you want a quick and efficient way to install hassle free. I have a Mazda6 so the cables were well long enough to cover the spaces I wanted.<br /><br />Quality: The lights look spectacular !! They are top-notch quality and one of the four light strips can completely illuminate the spaces in front of the seats. I used one on the driver side, two on the passenger (only because I really wanted to impress my guests but one can easily do) and one in the middle of the back seats below. Some lights modes aren't great and look like Christmas lights which I don't want to have on. But the stable blue, red and green modes are the only ones I use and they all look equally astonishing !! The sound mode is &#34;okay&#34; since it really only follows the bass so make sure it is blasting for a decent effect.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone wanting a simple upgrade on the looks for their car and definitely affordable considering the great quality. Several friends have been asking where to get them for themselves. 5 stars !!
B001O5LICO|5|used once and worked good
B000OUZA4W|2|Only a few bolts of each size.  And drawers come in WAY too many pieces.  Each drawer has to be attached to a very shabby backing and each row has to be hung separately.  The picture - to me - does not give the appearance of how it arrives and the work necessary to assemble it.<br />I, personally, would not recommend it.
B00DNU3MIG|5|Good clamps. I will use these on my future projects
B000PWTBHQ|5|Have been using K&N air filters for years and decided to give their oil filter a try. It seems to work fine. Easy to install and remove.
B0088CNNGK|4|So far, no problems. They make it easy to check pressures and add air if needed. I would buy again.
B003C01F68|5|asume and the work in a wide thickness of walls
B00B1VBQRS|1|I have an older Chevy Tahoe that is a work truck. It has developed a slightly rough idle and I had hoped this Royal Purple Max-Clean would help smooth it out. It had a tuneup not long ago with new spark plugs, rotor, wires, etc and that didn't make much difference either so I have to assume maybe dirty or sticky injectors. I expected some difference based on the claims made for this Royal Purple fuel system cleaner but It made no difference at all. I cannot detect any difference in how the truck idles or runs. I think I wasted my money. Maybe it works for certain other problems and might work for you but it is costly and no refunds if it doesn't work either.
B001P28OS2|4|some scratches but ok!
B002N4PYT8|3|On my 2006 Impreza, this blade (passenger side) does not actually touch the glass on the far right when the blade is near the bottom of the stroke.  Where it does touch the glass, it works as advertised.  I've had beam-style blades in the past from other manufacturers that did not have this problem, so I'd say that the Valeo blade may be a little too stiff for curvier windshields.
B000FOUB8M|4|This is more like what I was looking for. It was made to reach across a full side bed without  bowing in the middle.
B000NCOKZQ|5|very nice item
B00332GOEI|5|A year later and they're still holding up and looking better than all the other cars with the tape on their window trim. They fit perfectly into my 2004 accord sedan, they give it an aggressive look, block the sun, rain, and wind, and receive multiple compliments. Love it, the quality is great and I've had no issues with the windows rolling up and I installed them myself.
B000OOMQDG|5|This is a cheap economical add on which plugs into the trailer hitch socket instantly.  There is no wiring or extra installation required.  The amount of light it provides is about 70% of the low beam on your halogen headlamps or about 500 lumens.  500 lumens is about twice the light.  That is about 3 times the power of a Six Cell D Maglight which is plenty to illuminate the rear.  In comparison to the regular backup lights on the vehicle which are 3156 bulbs on mine it seems 50% brighter.<br /><br />The reasons for getting this light are the following:<br /><br />-  Extra light to load/unload<br />-  Emergency illumination of the rear if you are on the side of the road for better visibility to traffic<br />-  Backup light creates more visibility for you to see and alert other drivers/pedestrians<br />-  No hard installation.  Plug and play.<br /><br />You absolutely cannot go wrong for $15.  Other lighting solutions were over $100 and required hard installation.<br /><br />If you are looking for extreme backup lighting which is more powerful then the headlights of the vehicle then you will be paying a lot more and then comes the installation.  There is a product on Amazon which includes two 55 watt halogen lights and they will be just as powerful as your headlights up front.  However, that model is $80, its not a universal fit, there are extra relays needed and you need to install it by cutting wires, etc.  Im not doing all that just to get a little extra light which I wont use.
B000C9E0QE|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck.
B0009IQZH0|5|These towels certainly absorb water, and wring out nearly dry. I use them often and they seem rugged. They do the job advertised to do......
B002PQUDHC|4|They worked very well.
B00ILEVCHM|5|I bought the Enerfy package to be able to track all my daily activities. I used to have Runkeeper when I exercise, but now I have Runtastic as it also measures how I sleep. In general, I feel a lot better when I keep track on things as I can go back and hopefully identify things in my daily life that may affect the way I feel. Enerfy helps me relax more in traffic and I have also discovered that I am more involved now as a driver, since I really think about improving my score. Unfortunately I dont have any friends that I can challange but hopefully that will change…
B00COYNZJ8|5|I bought this more as a gag gift than an actual sunshade. Recieved it and was pleasantly surprised to get a legit sunshade. The photo looks awesome too, star wars fans will love it.
B00002243Y|3|I was expecting a well made set of HD jumper cables for this price and brand name. Nothing wrong with them in a pinch. I would not call them Heavy Duty however.
B00MV9QNMW|3|one l.e.d. was a little sketchy out of the bag!!! no box???wtf??? eventually it worked at the right pressure to the strip...6 brackets included with lights, i did not use them since i didnt want to drill into my car or light housing,i also noticed nothing really sticks well to the back of the strip i.e, two sided tape and epoxy didnt go over well either...., we shall see how long its hold up???p.s.,it does look nice at night time on the car...
B003QUGPW8|5|These are the best for cleaning and don't shrink.
B004BG89JS|5|Came as described. Fit perfectly.
B0049CM1NE|4|A little more wiring than I was expecting to do and they &#34;sell&#34; another kit with the wire taps and items everyone needs which is a bit frustrating but it performs as promised.
B0018YE9RW|5|Bought these for my 2001 Silverado and they fit perfectly. Had a problem with them dragging initially but that turned out to be both rear calipers being frozen, common problem on full size GM trucks, so new calipers fixed that.
B0080KN7RU|5|Perfect for the zombiephile, you can stick these just about anywhere. I stuck it to my laptop and have one on my jeep as well.  :)
B001VZL2MI|4|The chip really improved my mid-high end power. Haven't quite got it all figured out yet but it's great and fun to use. Even when using the performance mode you get better mpg if your not laying into it! Great product! Advice: update flashpaq online (easy todo) before installing on your vehicle.
B005RN0RMQ|5|We got this for our 15 year old autistic daughter because she loves to scoot around on anything with wheels but is very hard on products. This is great because it is made for use in an auto garage so is very durable. scoots on carpet pretty well too!
B005P5DSW2|5|I was looking for the perfect tire cover that would complete my black out look. I don't want designs on my cover so i choose this one. it work well and is high quality.
B006HW0KH8|5|Nice fit and finish. Has nice hardware included with the frame.
B00GD8OL62|5|Really really good fog light. Installed it for C300 W204 and it way brighter. I have the bi-xieon headlights and these lights match it perfectly
B003EVW92E|5|Easy to use with great result....car sparkles
B00R23IQZE|1|It said it would fit my car and it did not.
B000FQ0W1G|5|Amazon once again came thru as the low price leader for this type of product. I always check Amazon first!
B009WABLR0|4|Can't wait to use when standing outside watching kids sports this spring. I've been using it under my winter jacket during the recent 20 below winter weather. Very useful!
B00170L4ZC|5|Perfect fit, no whining or slippage at all. Only time will tell how long it will last, but I do not foresee any reasons why it would fail prematurely
B000FW4LLW|5|This is great and about half the cost of other sites.  This is something that everyone must have.. GREAT WORK!!!!
B00BCN4S02|5|Wonderful, fix 100% in my Mustang Gt 2012
B003XGYDE2|5|this air compressor  is wonderful  It was really easy to work and the instructions very helpful.  I recommend it for anyone.  The shipping was really fast also.  Had it the day after I ordered it
B0015DMNIS|5|Arrived just in time and works great
B001664JOA|4|We put these mattresses into the children's bunk beds in our travel trailer.  They fit perfectly and the mattresses are very comfortable.  I have even slept on these mattresses and they are comfortable for me.  I must admit that they are on the firmer side, however, i prefer a firmer mattress.  If one prefers a softer mattress, then purchase a cheap memory/gel foam as a topper and you'll have an extremely comfortable sleep.
B00CVFIJ4G|1|The rubber ripped just trying to get it on the key.
B00BCNN5J2|5|Great product
B000C7YQ9M|5|It worked beautifully on our Ford F150!!  And the price was excellent!!  Rarely do you get your moneys worth but we feel that we did with this purchase....  very very very happy!!
B001LHVOVK|4|I purchased the MS300 scanner for clearing the check engine light on my E-250 Ford Van with the small V-8. The auto supply shopes will run a test for free, but they will not clear the light, oh they will rent you the device for a fee so you can do it yourself. I found the device quiet easy to use, it took me longer to remove the item from the plastic wrapper, then it did to hook up the scanner, read the code, and clear the light. I have been having that wonderful P0420 \\" Catalytic Converter Code, triggering the check engine light to come on. I first took the van into the local Ford Dealership, and for the small sum of $1,600 dollars they can install a new converter, I went online and discovered that the PO420 code will come on, even if the Catalytic Coverter is operating at 95% efficency. I purchased a bottle of coverter cleaner online, run it through the system, and low and behold, no more check engine light to stare at. I am quite pleased with this item.[[ASIN:B002BVXM92 Cataclean Engine and Catalytic Converter Treatment- 16.7 oz.]]
B004FHEPSM|5|Perfect fit better than stock in mud
B00CAUG7E6|1|THIS IS JUNK.PAPER STUCK TO DECAL.I JUST THREW IT IN THE TRASH.
B000YC9FTQ|4|Works fine
B00274JM7E|5|This product is as described and of good quality. The tissues are surprisingly dust free. Yeah.. dust free and soft. No kidding. The tissues from the puffs/kleenex, etc. boxes that we buy for homes fit into these. So you don't have to buy their branded tissues. But I am thinking given they are soft and dust free I may actually refill theirs than kleenex/puffs.
B000E28EG6|5|These stainless steel ties do a nice clean job securing the header wrap they are easy to work with and look great THANK YOU!
B009AACAW2|5|Worked really good on my mom car I recommend this to everyone
B00FS67ZE0|5|No problems.
B005LRDBCQ|5|Worked great!  I installed directly over my broken mirror and used 6 of the double sticky circles.<br /><br />Just so you know; this is a piece of glass with window film over it.  Just like a limo where you can't see in, but they can see out.  Doesn't matter as once it's installed, it's just like a mirror.
B00E16M1S8|5|The battery works very good.  It was a little hard to install because of the handle.  I ended up cutting the strap to get it out of the way.  I would recommend that the manufacture use a belt type of handle rather than a hard plastic handle.  Other than that the batter went right in my Prius with not other modifications.
B0002MABGE|3|Fairly easy to use, but will put permanent marks in the ceiling of your vehicle when tightened enough to keep your dogs from pulling it down.
B004NKUF1M|5|worked great in my 1993 F150 with the 5.8 motor. simply bolted it on and never had a problem...much less expensive on Amazon and just as good if not better quality than from a retail store.
B004BT4P9I|1|none returnable remanufactured wrong I cant even use them order number 114-52992212-320-6624 I should be able to return inner bearing rear of hub is not built right . first items not happy with had to make an extra expense to get my truck going. sour note in my wallet . not happy  Oscar herrera
B002MQB2OI|5|I broke my helment but instead of having to buy a new one I just screwed on these parts and it's repaired.  Fast shipping and great price.
B0040Z7X5Q|5|I am just tickled pink. I love my shades, and yes they fit perfect. I was going to pay 95.00 to have these kind ordered and put on. But I ordered them myself and put them on myself. It was so easy. Yes my truck looks good. My ford Exployer 150. Year 2002. I love it.
B00N6D7K38|4|It works great, only good for looks, not for use. they are even brighter if you use them as fog lights. They give out decent amount of light for drl on my 2013 Honda Accord.
B00HZ3YIPS|2|fuel line outlet is different (wrong ) size had to spend more money to make work . oem would be better choice
B00AN5RLO0|5|Get it for the ninja 1k you won't regret it. Enough said
B0012TUUHG|5|Nice product at a good price, well made, well packaged, works fine in the shop, a fine deal at a good price.
B00D9BFR8M|4|I wish it had elastic on the bottom because it does not fit the motorcycle perfectly and flaps in the wind a lot. Especially on the bottom
B000C7YDE0|2|I bought this item to replace a $15 Chinese made product I already owned, because the Amazon photograph was identical to the original BMW part right down to part numbers on the plug. However when the Amazon supplied item arrived it was precisely the same Chinese product I already had but priced at over $60. (And I mean precisely the same product right down to the manufacturer paint dot). So effectively it was useless to me for my purpose of proving the fault and a waste of $83 AUD.<br /><br />My faith in Amazon to supply precisely what they advertise has been sadly dented. It would be a huge advantage for buyers if either...<br /><br />1. The appropriate correct photograph was advertised (as it should be)<br /><br />or...<br /><br />2. A big red note was attached to the photograph warning the buyer that the photograph is nothing like the item to be supplied.<br /><br />You should not be selling Chinese made parts and passing them off as something they are not by using photographs of BMW original manufacturer parts in the description.<br /><br />Please advise me why I should be paying for wrongly advertised product. Not acceptable Amazon.
B004L036Q0|5|These are driving lights first and foremost.  They are 55w which is about the same as normal headlights. If you need off road bright lights you need 100w lights.  Not these.  These I aim outward from my front bumper towards the side of the road to aid in spotting deer in the wooded areas in northern Michigan. They work perfect for that task.
B004FG1HQQ|5|I wanted something to help hold items from tumbling all over the trunk of the car. These Velcro blocks work great to add some structure to the trunk to hold boxes, grocery bags, and small coolers from sliding around and tipping over.
B00DSR1XTY|5|The helmet fits great!  With its modular style, you don't have the claustrophobic feeling you get with most full face helmets.  Plus, the flip down sun visor saves you having to keep a pair of sun glasses with you when you're riding.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works great. One suggestion, triple your tape out because u will do damage to your paint.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Super Soft!
B00K65FUWM|1|I almost fell for this. Read this first: http://www.newtiburon.com/forums/engine-management/208913-definitive-fake-performance-chip-info-thread.html
B00122EENE|5|Installed on a 2005 Civic EX.  Installed easily and the service engine soon light went off soon after.  Much cheaper than buying from the dealer or at national brick and mortar auto part stores.
B001KN13C0|4|These floor mats are better than the original mats that came with the car.
B001GGS45K|4|Does what I needed. needs to have stuff in it to though close easily. the twist closier bends in without any thing to back it up
B00IT6VUWE|5|Awesome fit, light weight, and airy. Motobuys customer service is excellent for a lack of better words. Awesome product and highly recommended.
B00ARVOC38|5|Excellent replacement for original.
B008MURH06|5|Towed lot of trailers with my little civic and it holds up great.  Highly recommend these hitches.  remember the cost of installation might be more than the product.
B0028080LG|5|Fit my 1994 YJ Wrangler, good quality durable finish, does not wear off when tightening and loosening. Black lugs look nice on aluminum rims.  Highly recommend.
B0070Y35S8|5|Very Glossy get compliments every car meet i attend. Have been told it looks exact same as $300 shop jobs don't hesitate to upgrade the looks of your car for pennies on the dollar.
B00PV6VU48|4|The main reason I ordered this set was so when I open my car door the door lights and overhead lights will be BLUE.  Set cam with a free LED bulb in addition to others.  Company responded when contacted.
B001GF2Q4Q|5|Love the look and construction
B000COSAEC|5|Good price for a good product. Direct replacement for the original shocks.
B000IZ2XYS|1|My electric door lock actuator needed replacement because the solenoid made a buzzing noise when it was actuated to unlock the door.  I bought this replacement and began to install it.  Prior to finishing the installment, I plugged it in to test it, and found that it also makes the buzzing noise of a worn out solenoid, but does so upon locking rather than unlocking as the old one did.  Upon close inspection, I can see that there are some small signs of dirt and grime on the product.  It was delivered in a small cardboard box without any sort of plastic sealed bag or anything.  I signed into amazon to see if I could return it, but my return window closed one day ago.  The weather has been bad and so I did not have a chance to do this work sooner since I have no garage available.  Very disappointed.
B000CQPUAC|5|Great product and excellent packing.
B005UQVSGE|5|Hooked up to the Rancher and all is well.....Great deal that can't be beat.<br />Looks like the OEM battery from Honda
B00G3YTGWA|5|perfect fit
B0047ROXOG|4|Second purchase and glad we did.  Use in our cars and outside house 12 volt lighting system.  Great output color and makes some things look 3D at night.
B0006HP9ZS|5|Give stars only because I didn't notice any difference but they have lasted 10000 miles so far on my 2003 Corvette.
B0050DBHW2|5|My wife is very happy that we put these on the bike - she now has a few different options for her legs on long rides!
B005JU5TUM|5|Really easy to install and has done a great job so far. Much better than stock blades. Will definitely buy again if they last
B001B0VP3E|5|These look great and add character to my Wrangler (2015 JK).<br />Easily installed and fit securely.<br />Also easy to pop back off without scratching any paint.
B007RQZOMO|1|why the package of the friction plate come open, this it a fake
B00466BK4Y|5|I bought this to use on my mother's 2003 Acura MDX.  Her headlights were completely hazed over with minimal scratches, but the light output at night was horrible and becoming unsafe.  I have never bought a full kit like this before.  But decided to pursue it regardless.  It is on the pricier side compared to others, but it works great.  Very complete kit.  Pretty good instructions.  I used a 120v Variable Speed Dewalt Drill to do this work.  It was perfect.  Things to remember - DEFINITELY take the time to clean the lens before you start and also MAKE SURE you tape around the headlight to avoid any paint damage.  It doesn't take long and the results are great in my opinion.  There will be a mess to clean up do to the over spray from wetting and polishing.  But well worth it in my opinion.  I added before and after pics.
B00CJ177PY|5|No problems.
B000IY8SUW|2|The pipe arrived as promised however after old pipe removal I found out that male fitting of the new pipe is not compatible with male fitting of old system.I am returning it back.
B00IKR18KG|1|This did not fit our 2011 Sienna as described... I tried all extra fittings and could not get anything to fit.  I will need to get one from Toyota.
B0041TJPUW|4|Mostly excellent products and super good service
B0002F668S|5|Helped me with my particular situation and very easy to install.
B000XQ9MGE|5|I have used this 4 or 5 times on my Chevy Trailblazer, at least once the battery was REALLY REALLY dead. It has always worked perfectly. It doesn't fully charge anymore (will only get to 3 of 4 lights), so I'm putting this one in our Honda Civic and buying a new one for the SUV.
B0002Z2MZ4|5|I have been a great devotee of ICE products and have never found something that I liked better than them until now.<br />I have used this on my cars and appreciate than it does not leave the dashboard and other surfaces with that shiny glow, which is especially not good on dashboards.<br /><br /> It cleans the dust and smudges that seem to accumulate on surfaces and does not spray all over the place so that you wind up with extra on your windscreen.<br />This wipes right on without the need to polish it off. The smell is pleasant and fresh with a slight citrus aroma.
B002MW6HRO|5|I used this with a new pioneer head unit.  I took out my cigarette lighter and replaces it with this on my 2000 Audi TT.  Works great!
B0067F0CDC|5|looks great, easy install, drill 4 holes, tighten the bolts and nuts supplied and thats it! looks sharp. very happy worth the money
B008JORKP2|5|Got this for a camping trip.  The flame was great and it kept us warm.  Didn't use as much propane ad I thought it would.  Would recommend it.
B0016IQYL4|5|Of course the part worked, and amazons vehicle compatibility guide was spot on when researching for this particular gem. Saved me time and money!
B001P1YAFO|3|I put this on my front bumper to hide the small drill holes thereon. It is alright but I was hoping for better quality. Oh well.
B00JDPYUDQ|1|Bought this set had it put in my truck the locking pin broke and where the main pin has a flat spot in it. It spins the main pin and when you go around a turn like I did the axle will come out causing in my case buying a new rear,bed,bumper,and shocks
B00BTMEWRA|3|very problematic and should have been mentioned  prior to purchase..&#34; some fabricating may be required for installation&#34;!!!  Especially for Harley installs.
B0019JD95E|4|the rain suit is a little big but should allow a jacket and chaps underneath  but alone are big in size.
B005FLR45S|1|I bought 7 fleur de lis stickers decals. Pink, white, 6 inches.   ( three 8x8 inches, for gifts,  which were not 8x8 - only 6 inches.)  Not fit for a gift.  Advertised -      Brand new -  yes,  but all were homemade.  ( That was not advertised.) I do not buy anything that does not come in a package.  They have a smell.  Came in a plan 5 by 7 envelope, no cardboard support. Package & stickers bent.  Advertised -  \\"Easy Application - FREE Instructions Included \\"  \\"Custom Decal ONLY from Ikon Sign & Design\\"   Not sure what that means, but seems like they should had been in a package.  No instructions came with them and I have a hard time peeling the backs off.  Probably because they are all homemade.  If you want the 8 x 8  fleur de lis decal, do not buy from the sticker girl.  Advertise exactly what you are selling.
B000C16XPI|5|Awesome!!! Easy to install!
B007X4LW62|5|My brother is in the Navy and I wanted to show my support with a Navy bumper sticker. I came across this one and I love it! It has been on my car for almost a year and still looks brand new. As fas as I remember it came on time and even had a personalized note from the shipper wishing my brother safe travels while he's serving our country! =] Very happy with this product!
B000COBLPC|1|I thought german products are good performance ( even if you have to somewhat sacrifice in reliability ), this thing made in india. During installation, one of the bulb housing fell off, so I use silicon glue to stick it back on.  For 80W, these pieces of crap are dimmer than my old PIAA 51W bulbs. Amazon is so nice, they refunded me in full.  I recommend KENSUN HID light kit also from Amazon, oh my, big difference.
B000PSBLTG|1|A total piece of junk. Pressure gauge doesn't work. Just junk, don't buy!!
B000GGTQVW|5|Love this product. Been using it for years.
B0068C1OYK|5|Product came in 2 days I was surprised as it said about a week. After receiving it I looked at it and looked at the one side of one page directions. To give a little background I am a cripple with a failed back and it took me longer to get the tools out then to put it on. I have a 2009 Polaris Ranger XP special edition 700.  I took the bolts and other parts and at first just placed the unit on the Polaris and saw where the bolts would have to go. If you have a winch or just the plate that covers where the winch goes that will have to come off for an easy install. I put the two bolts on the top in first with the nuts did not tighten them down as they were just to hold it up then I put my hand inside the winch opening and down in-front of the front transfer case and held the plate with the three nuts while I put the bolts in, once that was done I used an impact wrench to tighten the top two then the bottom three once tight I put the cover back over the winch opening ( I do not have the winch as I do not need that) and cleaned up job was done it is level and all it bolted right up and all in all it took maybe half an hour. I will use this to push things into my barn instead of backing them in as I have a stuffed barn.
B00130MU4K|5|Recieved this and was pleased to find that it had all the labels and markings of a genuine Motorcraft part. When I used this on my 2003 F150 I found that it was 100% the same part (except for the date codes) as the one it replaced.<br /><br />Installation was quick and easy and required no tools. I did remove the plastic cover over the top of the motor, however, to get a little better access to the rear of the intake.<br /><br />Motor runs great now. CEL cleared with my code reader and hasn't returned.
B002DFDR1Y|5|Hola, soy coleccionista de carros de Juan Pablo Montoya, y estuve buscando por un buen tiempo este modelo en partícular, al inicio me preocupe de comprar un modelo que  no fuera original de Nascar, pero esa preocupación desapareció cuando llegó el producto, definitivamente es un vehículo original,, el despacho se hizo a tiempo, y estoy satisfecho con mi compra.
B004GFS2C8|2|I followed the instructions step by step and it didn't work as is shown in the description, it just barely sealed the crack
B00008RW9V|1|It is leaving red fibers all over my black interior I will not use it again should I wash it or send it back.

B00OP45PL6|5|Perfect sticker, love how it's on a background of white and not clear so you can see the letters better!
B003PERH9K|5|nice combo for a dog lover. will mahe a great gift. peace love and dogs, very fun item to put on anything
B0055OLLFE|5|Outstanding service and quality product. Everything as advertised and promised.
B00T62RK1U|5|i am very happy with the lights i got from you i put them on my Motorcycle and tried them at night and there very good i will be getting more but i am retired so i have to wait for my next month check to come in first and shipping was very good to i got them on time like you said thank you again .
B00BXDRRLI|5|It was a bit big.  Probably my fault. I like how it fits, and the sunglasses come in handy when mine are in my backpack or at the house.
B000GZV904|5|I had to search high & low for this battery! I purchased it for 1986 Honda Rebel 250. It fit perfectly with posts on correct side. Once filled with acid, bike started right up & has been for 3 months now.
B00IZNVS8W|4|love it.
B001W6LGGS|4|Works good except for the fact that I have powered it with a power line that is on all the time.  Will redo when the weather gets warmer.
B000C9HBPQ|3|Bought these for a friend's car. He wanted a decent rotor for a good price. These seemed like a good compromise. AC Delco usually makes good products so I didn't think twice. These rotors have a black anticorrosion finish on the hat which looks more like spray paint. It is not even an some places are almost bare. The friction surface does not come with a nice nondirectional finish which I think is important for pad break in. This is the single reason why I won't buy these again. Centric makes a way better product for not much more.
B001892VAE|5|I wanted something small that I could store in the Jeep, this thing is great!  Holds my side windows and rear window no problem.  I have a 2 door 2007 JK.
B000DZTZRG|5|Turtle wax made something easy! This stuff works wonders on my Jeep. Turtle wax ICE was easy to apply and came off with no hard buffing and no white wax residue mess. This ICE stuff was easy on easy off and it made the paint look new again. My neighbor thought I had bought a new Jeep. I said never. I used the Turtle wax Ice spray detailer. Amazon had it for a good price and I tried it. I use it on my RV travel trailer as well.<br />Thanks Turtle wax.
B00FD2MWBU|1|Cheap metal. Would not line up at all.
B0006IX698|2|Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate.
B000C2U73G|3|The pump seems to be holding up very well. Comes with gasket and bolt pattern was correct. My only beef is that the pump comes with three threaded fitting holes with very tight pipe plugs inserted. The two smaller ones for the heater hoses were easy enough to remove. The larger hole for the bypass hose? Massive size hex. No way a shadetree mechanic has one of these in his/her toolbox. I ended up welding a long piece of steel to the plug and hammering it to get it unscrewed. They could have just put the plugs in a bag inside the box.
B0002Q7C3A|5|works as advertised
B00192JGDU|4|I haven't had a chance to use the equipment yet, so I can't give it 5 stars.  However, when I took it out of its packaging, everything was in place.  In fact, I am looking forward to my first picnic where I can show off my grill.  Although I didn't really really need it, the price was good and it made a<br />lot of sense to get it and have it than to not purchase it and kick myself for not purchasing it.  I have done that a time or two.
B00Y1HSLHC|5|Came with simple directions and works as it should
B0002HRBSU|5|Good product originally on the picture it was black arrived as pictured now, silver no big deal for me!
B00AZPP0Y6|5|Set these up as hideaway lights in my grill. Work awesome with absolutely no issues. Shipping was dead on and everything was exactly as they say
B003FYXIS4|4|These bulbs really aren't bad for the cost.  They are bright and clear, enhance vision and visibility at night, and modernize the look of the car.  The only real issue I had with them was that they were little hard to install.  Modern headlight bulbs are a square peg in a square hold affair for the most part.  The plastic lips on these seem a few mm off from the stock oem.  They were hard to get locked into place.  I eventually got the stubborn ones into place after a little bit of work with a fine tooth file.
B001CA77BM|5|Fast delivery, correct part.
B00COYNUCU|3|The pic reflects a small & very thin key lanyard.  I don't usually pay attention to measurements, but this time, I should've.  This lanyard is SUPER long & breaks off in 2 pieces.  NOT what I was looking for... but it'll serve other purposes.  I really like the design.
B00062ZM8M|5|Not only can you not find K&N anywhere else at this price you are hard pressed to find another brand that touches the quality K&N always delivers.  This filter looks great sitting atop my 392 and is the perfect compliment visually and mechanically for any high output engine.
B002Y1X7L2|5|Awesome
B007WZRBA8|5|Perfect for two young grandsons to have a movie marathon marathonon our journeys.
B00HWI6340|4|So I want to be fair to this product and make sure it gets an honest and fair review. I have not see other lamps from other vendors, I may be wrong, but it seems that these lamps themselves are not the best of quality. But that is to be expected for the price you are paying. The bulbs that come with the lamps are very cheap and I don't see them lasting a very long time so I went ahead and bought the bulbs for the lamps here on Amazon. The wirering harness is shielded with the round electrical tubing ( although not all the wires had the tubing around it for protection ) and was not bad at all for only one exception. The length of the wire which carried the plugs to the lamps is just about 4 inches to short. When I ran the wiring It was very tight and could not reach the other lamp without stretching the wire to its limit and still could not reach. I ran the wire in a very straight line too without any curves so it should have reached but didn't. I cut the wires and added on another 6 inches of red and black wire of my own just to be on the safe side. The plug then reached the other lamp without any problem.  Took out one star for this little issue. Besides this, the system works fine. Not sure how much better a more expensive system would have been which was worth $160. For now, I'm happy with it. Now we have to see if the lamps pass the test of time and weather.
B000CPAWJC|4|I was missing this remote and when I found it on amazon I was pumped and it fit and works like it should
B001G6PTDU|5|Perfect fit
B000VKTUJG|5|Received as expected.
B00GMR6IGK|1|I honestly did not find the way to stick them to the car door edge, so I just placed them and lost them after 3 days use....<br />they are not good... the don't come with clear instructions...
B006RYT89C|5|Really cool red emblem...Will definitely accent the rear hatchback of my R56 turbo Mini Cooper S.
B007IX14ZW|5|Great
B00142V66A|5|best flairs out there,hands down
B007CDYXHE|5|Awesome quality product and a good price shipping was fast as always as I'm a 2 day prime member and combined with k&n air filter and royal purple oil my bmw is running happy
B00LCBLHDA|5|arrived as expected, perfect replacement works great.
B001UC9ILO|5|Compressor was oem compressor and it works great, my ac in my 92 Camry blows cold.  It came with R12 mineral oil installed but my ac technician dumped it out and put pag oil 46 with ice 32 due to my ac was converted to R134a.
B00BLZ83T8|2|The clock worked fine for about a month or so. Then I started seeing missing segments in the digits. I tried swapping out the battery with the replacement they thoughtfully included, but that didn't work either. I won't buy this one again.
B000B66KFC|5|Great quality for the price.  Very solid metal and logo was very shape print. Have had other Ohio State plates and loved this one the most.
B000EBICHS|5|Just as pictured..Fast shipping..Great seat cover..couldn't find one that matched the interior but I did find it here at Amazon.
B00C7I4JXC|5|Great misc size bags to keep you organized.
B001FFY334|5|It fits. And my car has not exploded, so it must be working correctly.
B000KZ23LY|1|Didint work at all dont buy anything from this guy
B00KW27MTI|1|The large outer ring no matter how hard you try will not fit.  The other 2 pieces fit good.
B001DRNNYY|5|perfectly fit my 03 Honda Odyssey!  FYI: Previous one had 50k miles on it, and was very dirty.
B000G76PLA|5|I know these are meant for canopies but I used to secure deck enclosure. Love these cords. Simple and work great for any tarps or canopies you need to secure. Price was great and super fast shipping. Happy with this purchase!!
B000ETXU6I|5|I received 5 exactly like the picture shows. These are of the highest name brand quality. They are removable once installed however bring that they can hold back liquid and air they tend to muck up the end of the hose if you remove them because of the tight fit. No extra tools are required to install or remove them.
B000CN56LI|5|Thank you.
B008MCV9TE|5|I put these floor mats in my 96 honda civic hatch. They fit perfectly, and the quality is awesome (the red stitch looks great)! They were also cheaper than other similar mats listed on amazon. Very pleased.
B002FT3JMU|5|good fit, good quality, it works.
B000E81VN8|5|Very good product really helps to keep things in place on our Subaru Forester
B000QGNMLW|5|works great a little big for my 94 camaro but they work just fine
B000FQ0EXM|5|Fit nicely. The plastic is sturdy but you may have to cut out the speaker openings a little with a razer knife depending on your speakers.
B0002KKIUK|3|Does what is represented but the cost out ways the benefits for non-use. Color maintained and easily to apply with only twice a year.
B000IY3ILQ|1|wrong part for my truck
B00KVHXBXU|5|Great product, awesome sound,  easy installation!
B00B50UKYK|3|Fit fine just didn't match up height wise but it's looks better than before. Just better to go with Megan's or eibach
B00FTAX4BI|5|These replacement struts came very quickly and were exactly as advertised.  A great fit and easy to install!
B00JDPQPX4|5|I am a very happy and pleased to own this great rig. I have had mine for 4 months now and I have never had one built as well as this one is. I have always carried a pack with me everyday and I was not planning to make this one into a everyday carry rig. But I now don't leave home without having this great rig and I am able to have anything that I need no matter what it may be.
B000C7TU4S|5|The product fit perfectly and works great
B0079MU8N6|2|installed and it took the charge  - started the bike was happy - then after sitting for a week I tried to start it and the one cell was shorted - you get what you pay for
B004TGVP14|5|This lubricant worked very well.  I used my own stiff brush rather than the one supplied with it attached to the cap.  It spreads very easily on the back of the brake pads and eliminates any squeaks resulting in a very  professional job when done.
B00IKCPYR4|5|they work great at a better price
B0045CUNT2|4|I repaired spark plug hole for a 2001 Ford Escape. The middle plug near the fire wall blew out and damaged the coil pack. The tool worked great for restoring the hole back to size. The manufactuer suggested removing the head to perform this procedure, but this was not necessary  for the ford escape. The hole was drilled a taped at the same time. Vaccumed the shavings from the cylinder. Installed new insert with fast setting loctite. The procedure walks you through installation.
B00I1WD1M8|5|I recently bought a car with cloth seats and I didn't want to get dog hair on them when traveling so I bought this product and it is great. The hammock covers the seat bottom and goes up partially in the back and front protecting the back portion of the rear seats. The fur base is very soft and seems quite comfortable for the dog.
B00J0A5X5I|5|Works wonderful and heat resistant
B0012TYNY2|5|......got it for the free shipping, but it turned out to be just what's needed to keep the BT handy in the toolbox of the boat.
B005C2ACBI|5|Been using these for years, with great luck.<br /><br />I would add that the same company makes a 1&#34; version that is not worth bringing home. Had 4 sets of the 1&#34; version, none currently function. Most of the 1&#34; versions broke after the first use.<br /><br />We have about 8 sets of these 2&#34; versions and all of them are still working today, after about 8 years of regular use with tying ATVs and cargo all sorts of heavy bulky items.<br /><br />We just bought more of these 2&#34; versions.
B000MG6308|5|I used this product on my 2011 Honda Accord EX-L and they made a huge difference. I now have a 2012 Acura TSX and I plan to use them on my high beams. Low beams come with HD lights factory installed! I highly recommend this product!
B007EHCUKK|5|Gorgeous shirt. Will make a perfect Christmas gift!
B00INSRXPG|5|Nice looking and holds to vehicle well.
B00ASY7HJA|5|Not cheap but good fit and sturdy
B007GCD408|5|Great product at a great price for the John Deere Power Loader. Two happy grandchildren!
B0055DTDK0|4|best value<br />priced right , fast shipping , and of course fits perfectly on my honda xl500r<br /><br />my only complaint is there is no application data in add.<br />i had to go to manufactures web sight and research to get the correct part #
B007KPT77A|5|Exactly what it is supposed to be.  Easy to install, worked perfectly.  Expect it to last as long as the bike.
B00V9DZ58O|4|Purchased this oil filter wrench to remove/install the filters on my 2 riding mowers with Kawasaki engines.  Works well on the larger one but too big for the smaller one.  I don't fault the manufacture but question why Kawasaki would have such a smaller diameter on an engine with just a few lass horse power.  All is okay and would recommend this product but you should check the diameter of the filter and see if this will fit.
B000GZQM9C|5|Big feet, bigger boots? You need this. Especially in the rain. Perfect for bigger intakes too.That little difference in size made huge difference in comfort. 2000 Sportster.
B000H6P55W|4|Love it, just wish it came with directions
B00R0SBFV8|5|I have been confused writing this review because my car, a Prius V, does not appear in the abbreviated heading &#34;Camry, Sienna, Venza...&#34; So, now that I think I'm reviewing the correct item (caps for a 2012 Prius V) let me say that they're great. Unfortunately, I originally ordered the incorrect item which was listed for a Prius without any indication that it would not work on a Prius V. Who needs wheel covers when the uncovered wheels with these caps look so good!
B002MEJB1Q|5|very good item
B006OQ3NMQ|5|Bought for travel trailer ---new at camping I kept asking how do you know when the &#34;dirty&#34; line is done...so I found this bought it..omg it does work great..I need to order two more for other campers..they were impressed.
B000C3BB44|5|Perfect fit, seems to be working well.
B0040DX7EO|5|Great quality
B004BZYKWO|5|This is for standard rotation 351w, as is the red cap version. I dropped this in, set timing to 12 degrees and the boat has never ran better. It does come with some springs to change the curve, but it worked perfect out of the box for me.
B004AIGSUY|5|A very quality replacement part that looks and works as good or better than the original, perfect fit, switch is lighted like original,....and best of all...like ALL Dorman products it has a Lifetime Limited Warranty!<br /><br />And also Amazon price beats your local big chain Auto parts stores by almost half the cost!...Thanx Amazon!<br /><br />Note: The bezel on this Dorman replacement switch is Grey in color, Although GM did offer this switch with either a Grey, Tan, Blue or maybe another color bezel depending on your interior color, But if you want its easy to snap off the outside bezel from your old switch and snap right on to the new one if you want to stay with your original color and its not rocket science to do!
B009902Y4C|5|as advertised
B000MV2I9S|5|great product
B003HSOILO|5|The quality is plush and full.  The front mats fit absolutely perfect.  The rear both have a notch cut out that I don't know what they are for, and do not seem necessary, but not enough to be a problem.
B00368PDDW|5|when I had my STi I redid my cooling system with Mishimito products when OEM parts failed. My OEM hoses had a small hole that developed over time. I wish these where cheaper but you get what you pay for.
B005CC2F2C|1|I purchased these for my travel trailer so I could grease my wheel bearings on the road without having to tear the trailer apart each time...<br /><br />I'm sure they would have worked great because they do on my car trailer but they fell out of my hubs while traveling.... On my first outing after installing them I lost one of them.... Just fell out I guess...  I checked the other 3 to make sure they were driven in all the way and they were installed properly.... Next camping trip I lost another one of these...... Just fell out.<br /><br />I am not sure why they fall out but they do..... I purchased the right ones (2.44) for my hubs so there is no telling what is wrong with them. I'm going to find another brand when I buy replacements.... It gets costly to keep throwing away $29 every time I tow my travel trailer.
B003XIRPLS|5|Looked at a number of mounting brackets in stores. Found this one on camping world. We really like it. Easy to mount.
B003R7HEUW|5|ok, the cold winters froze my window shut, didnt realize that the motor could burn out which it did.  I could have gotten a cheaper motor but the quality would have just been alright.  I watched some videos online about how to replace, hardest part was removing the door panel.  I was able to remove the old put in the new motor and my window has worked flawlessly since replacing.
B00GD4IX10|5|My hubby couldn't beleive how fast it arrived and the price is GREAT!!!
B008CSS8Y2|5|very good part that made it to my house in record time. Very easy fix, and priced a fraction of what the local Polaris dealer I had been dealing with in the past wanted to rip me off for me for. Pro Tech part and a great warrantee.
B009W08ONY|3|This truck box was not slotted to fit my 2003 Chevy Silverado, so I had to drill my own holes in order to mount it properly. It also came with several dents courtesy of FedEx, and is made out of aluminum, not steel like the description says. I Herculined  the whole thing inside and out before I mounted it. So far it works and looks good.
B001EOV492|5|Had to order this in a hurry (I know everyone that has kids has always had that one kind of child who waits until the last minute to tell his parents and then expects everything to be taken care of yesterday)  - as I was helping my son move.  As a PRIME customer I knew I could get the item in 2 days - however what a shock - I ordered it on Thursday and it as at my door on Friday.<br /><br />Yes, the CURT is a few dollars ($4.50) more that the Reese - however CURT is made in America!!! and yes I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a product that is made very well
B007BLMWYI|5|All fine. Thanks
B0049DUJ4G|4|Fits my 2008 Ford Fusion.<br /><br />It's plastic - whatever.
B0007TV6M0|5|I use this on my car every time I wash It approx every two weeks. This product is very easy to use and gives the car a very nice waxed shine. Just make sure your vehicle is WET when you spray it on then simply wipe off with a towel.
B0087NAZM0|5|Very pleased with the SENA's and they've been through some moderate rains for maybe 10-20 minutes without problem. Just be cautious that your helmet around the rim is fairly flat. My modular is a bit convex and it causes the sena mount to bend and make it a little difficult to rock into place at times, but the other helmet with a more normal shape has no issues to speak of and it's great to speak to eachother up to 55-60mph. Otherwise it's great for cueing if you're going faster than that.
B000BVRZ74|5|Since I got this product with the trigger sprayer, putting the Rain-X on my vehicles is alot easier & faster. I give it five stars all day long. Excellent product. Phil A.-Newburgh, In.
B0046I3I8I|1|worst thing i ever ordered returned not tire cover
B00BFUFT2S|4|Top notch stuff I love it
B00429NKWK|5|The kit worked great.  As well as could be expected since my lights were in really bad shape.  Not totally clear now but much better.  All the haze is gone.  I think if I had sanded longer the slightest scratches would have eradicated.  Only took an hour to do both sides.
B00433SIQI|3|I only bought this kit for the squeegee tool which is very useful for pushing corners down and in. Would have been slightly more difficult without it but not much.<br />You can simply use 1 tsp baby shampoo and water for the spray.
B00DQRSK9C|5|This is a Very Good Battery !!
B005GLQCKA|2|Ok product...being a professional tech and using this tool...have to say tool flexes too much, tool is cheaply made along with the dual piston design tool also from same company which broke after 5 uses... also on some vehicles it does not push the pistons all the way in because of the flexing because its maxed out all the way i would pass on this product and get a more durable and sturdier quad piston compressor..
B00NY4LQHU|3|I Really thought these were good quality lights the ones i got had some kinde of glue on the finish very sloppy build like they were in a hurry putting them together and one of the lights it wasn't even pained good it had sone spots without the black finish  i will try them and see how long they last
B005NLQAHS|5|This product works and I don't have any problems connecting with a wireless connection to my Nexus 7 tablet.<br />Many cheaper products sold on ebay do not work very well at all, but this product works.
B00C7I4PL8|5|I just love these for chip clips and general purpose pinching applications.  They work, hold well, and are colored.  What more could you ask for?
B00PVU8VL4|5|I absolutely love it! Gave my girl that little something extra! Plus, it'll be nice to not have to dig the snow and ice out of there before winter fill ups!
B00FS3C8AO|5|Arrived quickly and well package, and appears to be well built. Haven't used it yet, but expect that it should more than do the job. Also, the price was really right.
B004GEHDZ6|5|Nice product! it fits perfect and comes complete with the structure needed to install properly.<br />Best price on the web.
B005MZX03C|3|Oops, it's bigger than I realized.  I bought it for my fridge, but it's really a car magnet.  I don't go for displays that public, so I got rid of it.  But if you really want to make a statement for your car, go for it.
B0075FU38W|4|The key is great but after removing the chip and guts of the old key, the car will not start. The locksmith who cut my key said that the chip needs to be re-programmed. Not sure about this. I carefully took out the chip and there isn't any damage that I can see. The key works as a remote to open, lock, alarm and turn on my radio, but does not start the car. Any suggestions?
B006BF1I7C|5|Item was shipped and received in time. The MyGig update was both a pleasant surprise and easy install as well as the maps.  I really wish the system came with a Gracenotes upgrade as well but that's not NavTec's responsibility.  Everything works great.
B002P8JJ2U|5|It was an instant fit. Just had to get it painted. Would buy more parts. They match up very well.
B00BUBSBYA|5|Fit much more securely than my previous Thule Rack.  Thule Universal Flat top fits nicely on this rack.  Noisy without the wind shield.
B001UHHMRG|5|This stuff is awesome. While it might not have the same amount of filling capability as Chemical Guys Glossworkz, it has a more-than-acceptable shine and a brilliant wet look that I just love. If I'm glazing, I'll use this first unless I need to fill in marring and swirls and don't have the time (or they don't have the budget) to do a paint correction the 'right' way. This stuff is a great in between. Always follow up with a sealant and/or wax for extra protection, and to increase the durability of a glaze!<br /><br />This stuff smells like grapes, so like other Chemical Guys products, they all smell great.
B0016LE80K|2|The plug is too long.  It pops out of the cigarette lighter in the car I wanted to use it in.  It wasn't worth returning since it's so cheap, so I use it in my other car that has a longer opening apparently.
B001C99TGO|5|Works and fits great on my 99 F250 as any part does that I have ordered from Amazon. Would buy again.
B000C59SM4|5|These shocks fit perfectly on my 2000 Chevy Venture Warner Brothers Edition. Installation was easy (even for a non-mechanic like myself) and the compressor air hose fittings (the little nubs coming out from the back part of the shocks) were a spot-on fit for the existing connections. The only way this order could possibly have been improved would have been if the shocks were delivered via drones and were accompanied with an ice cold six pack of my beverage of choice. For installation instructions, the video by 1A Auto (no, they are not paying me for the reference, but maybe they should!), found at: [...] was a great help to me, but there are several other informative videos as well. Good Luck!
B004A6JA2O|5|Great Product. Easily installed after watching you tube video. Recommend it to all.
B002UJ13QO|5|I keep my '04 Jaguar XJ in pristine shape and it has been disheartening to see the headlamps and front turn lamps turn to white frost across the top halves of the lenses.  After seeing ads for a competing product, I went to my local auto parts store where they recommended the 3M product - \\"We've heard good things about it\\".  It takes some labor working through the multi-step process but the results are amazing!  I told my wife that it was like getting new headlamps which was like getting a new car to me.  It took away that one thing that made the car looked aged.      Follow the directions closely and be sure to tape off any surrounding painted surface fully as it's easy for the rotary pad to 'walk off' the lens surface.  Use 2 - 3 layers just to be sure.  This is one product that is well worth the price and the labor!
B000B7TFIK|5|It runs!
B001VLK0RA|5|I ordered this pump at my husband's request and he seems very satisfied with it.
B00LH8GJGS|2|I noticed there were crease marks on the films and was hoping they would disappear if I installed them on my windows but I was wrong. After squeegeeing it out, there were marks in certain areas that never go away because the crease marks were actually damages to the film's delicate layer. It makes it look really awful. I took them off. It was only 30 dollars so I don't mind losing 30.
B002G47GE6|5|Fit my 2012 tdi golf perfectly! Will buy again.
B0012WHBSO|5|I recently bought this item and it came just in time! coincidentally I caught a nail on my tire while driving a couple days after receiving the compressor, boy o boy I used this bad boy and I was immediately impressed with fast inflation. It's large pressure gauge and screw on connection to tire is also great! I like that is has an amp fuse built into power cord. Most of these cigarette lighter compressors don't have a fuse like this. This held me down for a couple days before I was able to go get the tire repaired. This was a definite great buy for me and I would buy again!
B00BLAFZP8|2|For the price they work very well.  Within 6 months the bulbs started to fail just past the main warranty.  Amazon stepped up and took it back, Amazon does the right thing for the customer.
B007EDNOP4|5|I was very surprised at how thick and tough this cover was when I received it.  I do not have a covered storage facility for my boat, so I rely on the cover to protect it.  This is why I looked for a good 1200 denier cover, and I could not be more satisfied.  It provides excellent sun and water protection and withstands being pulled tight over the corners of my windshield without me having to worry about tearing.
B00SBZRELY|5|Awesome
B00NT9IN12|5|It's amazing how such a small charging pack can jumpstart a car, but it really does work!<br />I received this unit as a sample for review, charged it, and put it in my truck. a few weeks later I used it to jump a minivan's battery that had given out in the cold snap we were going through, and it worked GREAT! it is also useful for re-charging your phone or tablet, but more importantly YES this will work to jump you car - no matter how small it looks!
B0002SRJD6|4|Well constructed old school style oiler that can take abuse and is meeting my needs. Would of given five stars but there are a few things I don't like for an item of this price range. The can doesn't have quart graduation markings on the side; no plug or cap for the spout to stop spills, no cover for the fill hole to keep dust and dirt out, and the trigger is hard to hold down for old farts. I bought a rubber stopper for the spout and made a cover for the fill hole. There is a minimum fill arrow on the side required for the oil to go through the pour outlet to the spout. There will always be some oil left in the bottom and in the spout.  There is no indication on the can or in the product description stating were its made.
B000FP0A82|5|I searched for 2 days reading reviews before I bought this jack.  There were several cheaper models available, here are the reasons to spend a little more money<br /><br />Pros<br />1.  larger wheel makes it very easy to maneuver your trailer in the driveway<br />2.  This jack is high quality and the jack does not deflect (lean)<br />3.  It's marine grade so it's more corrosion resistant than regular jacks<br />4.  The quality is impressive, I'm glad I spent more for a top of the line jack I won't have to replace soon.
B004S24VOC|5|Love it!
B0034CW1L2|2|Many of the different length adapters were poorly machined and did not fit into the gauge. No labels for anything. Doesn't match the photo in discretion... There are no markers on the gauge like the photo and the gauge itself is a cheaper version then what's pictured.
B001SLHPQM|5|Exactly what it says it is.
B0009OMYAQ|5|Made removing the filter easy.  LOVE IT!
B00FZL6602|4|For a Harley VROD Muscle.  Great quality and easy to swap out with previous ones.
B0068FWGOO|1|I ordered a red and black helmet. It is orange and black. Definitely does not match my bike as I'd intended. Fail.
B00GD8CMDQ|5|Thanks so much
B003VZLJFG|5|My headlight was really foggy/cloudy.  Read over instructions & proceeded.  Wasn't hard to do. Followed instructions exactly.  Did it twice.  Beautiful.  Husband noticed when he arrived home & could tell the difference immediately.  Doesn't look brand new, but 90% better than they did.  They were awful.  Should have used gloves.  Didn't like product on my hands, but product didn't dry my hands.  Will do again when weather warms up!  Arrived on a timely basis & compared to price my dealer would have charged, this was a no brainer.  Would purchase again & recommend
B00R0MOWDW|5|Got this stabilizer quickly and packaged well. It works well and solved my shakey tires.  I'd buy it again
B00BKO3YTE|5|Thanks
B0013GLGOO|5|Pay attention to the small details; do prep work (pre-clean lens with rubbing alcohol)don't clean the lense then touch it with your greasy little fingertips, 3m tape everything off far over the edges so you can start your spray off the lens and feather the edges in before you move further across, DO NOT spray on too heavy, use multiple EVEN light coats if necessary(ie;a headlight may only need ONE light coat),<br />DO NOT sand the tint after spraying(!!!), wait at least 10/15min between coats - after your final coat of tint wait at least an hour BEFORE SPRAYING ENAMEL. If you do decide to use enamel spray light coats while wet sanding between coats \\"DO NOT sand tint coat only sand the clear\\"!! - eventually you will have smoothed multiple layers of clear and after your last sanding finish off with a plastic lens polish for longevity. So far my un-enameled rear lights are doing just fine but I would wonder if doing headlights can hold up as well - worth noting is I like the matte finish of my tail lights without the clear coat. Either way this is a great and CHEAP product with great results if you pay attention to the details - good luck!!<br /><br />PS this stuff can be removed with a spray on brake cleaner if you don't like the results (tint only NOT enamel) - just do not sand the lens before spraying the tint on.<br /><br />PSx2 one can will do two large truck tail lights and maybe a third brake light if you don't go heavy on the tint coats.
B00B7TNZ0K|5|Nice quality, glossy finish. Bar keeps laptop from slipping and handle makes it portable. My daughter really likes using it.
B000GZN8BW|5|Still working and looking great
B00C9Z3PTM|1|It was far to large for my car even though it stated it should fit it. Then I was chareged to return it.
B000778LCU|5|works as it should shipped quickly
B00G0OM2BK|5|pain in the ass to install but fits perfectly comes in genuine oem honda package
B000IYT00E|5|This was a Christmas gift for my son who was excited to received it.  The product was exactly what was described in the publication.  The product was of good quality and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0009IQZH0|5|I bought 2 packs of these microfiber cloths and they dry my car great leaving no lint or anything else behind, will buy again.
B006ORF3BY|5|Well I got this thing opened the box all the parts are there and not much in the way of instructions. But the install was so easy a retard could do it. In fact with this install it is so easy if you need instructions you probably shouldn't be riding a motorcycle. Best advice is don't rush yourself. Put the thing on the bike leaving all of the bolts just finger tight. Once it is all on and you have adjusted the windshield right where you want it. Use some Loctite and tighten all the bolts as tight as you can to keep it from vibrating loose and moving on you. It is a very simple windshield I have a red bike and bought some Red lens paint and put a couple coats across the bottom couple inches and it looks great. I never liked the looks of a windshield before but this one is simple enough that with a little imagination you can make it look pretty cool. Have had it as high as 100mph and it held up fine. Just make sure to keep your bolts tight and the back angle right and you should also have No Problems.<br />A friend just bought a bike and we are ordering him one today.
B00180JGAQ|4|There is no excuse to go with any lesser quality.  Stick with a name brand like Moog and drive in peace.
B001LPUEEU|4|What can I say?  It's the same as the original fuel pump at a much better price.  I installed it in just a few minutes and it did what it was supposed to do: pump fuel.  The only hitch was that the connection plug differed slightly from the original on my vehicle so I had to file off one locating groove on the new part.  That done, I connected it and have not had to bother with it since. I recommend it.
B00RCA2C3Y|2|I had to return this product because even though the site says it will fit Ford F-350's, it doesn't fit my 2015 F-350 Dually Diesel.  They look nice and probably will look good on certain vehicles but they have no way of attaching on the 2015 F-350.  The connectors on these lights  look like oversized christmas tree light connectors.  They did not even come close to fitting on my truck.  I gave it 2 stars because it looks like a nice unit but they have to be much more accurate in their descriptions and list of what vehicles these lights will actually  fit on.
B001C6P0NS|5|worked perfectly to fix my 2003 saab 9-3 2.0. bolted rite up and made the job a breeze. save big money with the 6616
B00LND6AF2|5|Works great on my 2014 Ford F-250 XLT
B0006IBYSI|4|Good for colder climate areas. You should consider WD-40 if you are high temperature areas as the WD-30 is less viscous.
B00P2D41LE|5|2008 Chevy silverado. Perfectly replaces the OEM bulbs, look really good in the reflectors with no hot spots or dead areas.<br /><br />More expensive then the typcal chinese bulbs, but significantly better quality. Fully expect these to outlast the truck.
B003W5NWKA|4|It does not roll or fold flat.this is do to the size of the windshield.Yes it is a little difficult to put in place,need to get used to it,however it does keep the vehicle a lot cooler,absolutely useful.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Outstanding item. My husband loves the large dial, its great for using at night.
B0058DIAPG|5|These really look good, anf I like the fact they aren't metal, living in Mn.
B0051PKN56|5|especial
B00K3GSKZI|1|This is not a heavy duty mat as they say it is. I bought it to park my snowblower on in my garage, it is very thin and not suitable for much more then a throw rug.
B000VL024C|5|This is more of a review of the installation of the filter than the actual filter itself. Let's be honest, an air filter is just an air filter - this one is constructed as well as it should be, it fits well and it's doing it's job. You do need to wiggle it just a touch to get it to fit back into it's slot but even the OEM filters are like that but you'll pay twice as much for those. I installed this in a 2007 VW GTI and it took about 2 minutes total, it's that easy and quick. Just go on youtube and type in \\"(whatever type of car you have)cabin filter install\\" and they've got some great videos which make it even easier. Since the VW dealer wants $70 plus to install a new one of these this is a great way to save yourself a quick $50 or more for a few minutes of work - if you call unscrewing 2 plastic screws by hand work.
B005345DBY|5|Got it for the wifey , for when riding the motorcycle . It make it a quite ride . ( just joking )  she said it keeps her warm on those late night ride .
B000CO7QLK|4|Cheap and works like it's supposed to. They are made of a soft metal so be careful tightening them down and make sure you are not cross threaded
B00M2JXILU|4|Easy to install but does not come with wiring instructions
B000I4JPZE|5|Love it !!, ... Especially since I've not had to use it yet ;-)
B004PC0CQG|3|The mirror on these is plastic and not glass so the reflective surface is not very good at all
B00C43EO94|5|Looks great and easy to apply
B007Z35Y56|5|These are my go-to fishing gloves.  Whether getting them off the hook or cleaning the fish, these give me the &#34;gription&#34; I need and they protect my hands.  They wash up easily, dry pretty quickly, and don't retain all of the fish smell.
B00DSQZUZI|5|This is the only belt that I've found that doesn't squeek. Even these belts will squeek after a couple of years; this is a known problem with the 2005 Nissan Frontiers with the V-6 engine.
B00873J0YY|5|My Kayak racks arrived when they said they would, the shipping took longer than I expected so order them early if, like me you need them right away.  Assembled and installed them in just a couple hours with minimal problem.  Someone more mechanical probably could have done it faster, but I am proof anyone can do it.  I was able to haul my two kayaks just under 900 miles without losing them.  I did stop half way and buy ratchet straps to replace the tension straps that came with them because the ones from that came with it kept working lose as we were passing bigger vehicles.  I would absolutely buy them again.
B005OZNJ9K|5|This is the original key, not an after market version. It works perfectly.
B00CH6T18C|5|I got this product to review. I use this in my car I can see a different of the leather it is softer. It don't have a weird smell and i like that It does not have a smell. I will keep buying this product.
B00BZA260G|4|I Havent installed it, but when the time come's i Will  get to it in time ans write a proper review
B002CMTBKY|5|For some reason, these type of products are getting hard to find in the local automotive stores but AMAZON.COM had them in all kinds of fancy designs and sizes.  Since my van is older I just needed something to \\"spruce\\" it up a little and these worked for a great price.
B00556LEAE|1|Does not work at all. Waste of money. Please refund me
B000SP5YUS|5|Recieved on schedule, USPS, Excellent tool. Mine was a Black Handle. I can not do without this time saving tool. I highly recommend this  product. THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.
B00318UXT6|2|This charger seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I have three cars and the included clips to fit the battery posts are too small to fit any any of my cars. I purchased new, larger clips and added them to this charger. It seems to work well at first. I have an antique car the is only driven a few times a year and requires a \\"float charge\\" to keep the battery conditioned between monthly starts. This charger always changes to error code F05 after several hours of float charge. I thought the battery may be bad so I purchased a new battery (at over $100.00) and the charger does the same thing. I decided to check it on my other two cars with the same results. If you're looking for a charger to maintain a seldom used car, this isn't for you. I've since purchased a Exide charger and it's been flawless.   This light-weight charger with tiny clips may be well suited for occasional use for small batteries, but was a disappointing.
B00BYH6C1E|5|PERFECT, where have these been my whole life!!!
B000RG4AYY|5|Made my bike run like new... probably better!<br />My pipes don't sound as loud as before but that's probably a good thing because I believe it signifies that the oxygen to gas mix isn't as lean as it was before.<br /><br />Anyhow, great product.
B000C41NH8|5|Does what it says.
B001JQTMXU|5|I ended returning cause I didn't need this actual product but it looks like it should do as stated from what I saw.
B004HE554Q|5|You're much better off buying factory pads as opposed to aftermarket pads.  It was helpful for me to watch the video on U-Tube for my 2002 Chevy Trailblazer to aid in installation.  This brake pad set includes new retainer springs and the metal backing for the pads, so you don't have to add sealant or worry about noise. The braking on the vehicle is now like driving a new car. Why buy aftermarket brake pads when you can get original factory parts at a low price?
B00BRLCC66|4|so far so good.  I think my car responds well with this brand of oil and I think I'll continue use this brand.
B002S459SE|5|works great would buy again easy to install starts every time great price nothing but good good good ggod things
B00J5R7A9S|4|Fast and easy to install
B00TU8UUK8|5|Spattered eagle  EPIC
B0009IR056|5|Probably same as Briggs and Stratton but cheaper
B001C4UQKW|5|My engine is slightly anemic, it's a newer 4 cylinder with under 200 Horsepower. It's nothing special.<br /><br />I've heard of many people taking the base model 2014 Dodge Avenger (AKA my car) and putting in K&N cold air intakes, with some great results both in power and mileage. I'm far too cheap and inexperienced to buy a cold air intake kit and set it all up, so I decided I'd rather just nibble at the notion of improving my vehicles performance. I came from the assumption that any improvements wouldn't be noticeable, and I was proven wrong. The car, in general, responds more aggressively, the increase in acceleration is quite nice seeing as beforehand I couldn't feel any G's while holding the gas pedal down. Now, I feel like I'm driving a smaller V6 as opposed to a 4 cylinder. You can actually hear the car breath now, which is a 'breathe' of fresh air, seeing as how dead and mechanical it used to sound, (it doesn't sound any louder, it just sounds better).<br /><br />PRO's:<br />-performance increase<br />-sound's better<br />-acceleration<br />-Better mileage(in theory)<br />-extremely easy to install<br />-filters air<br /><br />CON's:<br />-lower mileage (due to lead foot)<br />-Pricey<br /><br />Three things to note:<br /><br /> *Many claim that a filter like this is an economical choice due to one never having to buy a replacement, but I disagree. It's 50$ plus the cost of the cleaning kits when ready to clean, or 10$ every 20,000 miles. The only way you will see a return on investment with this is if you use a car for 10 years or 120,000 miles. Though in theory the gas mileage could affect that cost difference.<br /><br />*This is not a transformative solution, it will improve your engine's performance and efficiency by single-digit percentages, some more performance-oriented cars will see even less of a jump due to already being designed for performance from the get-go, cars with less ambitious initial goals will benefit the most from the installation ofthis air filter. Keep that in mind.<br /><br />Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product for those who are willing to do their research.
B0065FRBZ6|3|OK Product, but not really leather like material.  Holds more than expected.  Straps are difficult to attach to to bikes.  Worth the cost.
B0018QVNK6|5|Like the gloves but I just had to cut two of the fingers off fo my use
B000PEPCGI|5|Used this to color sand a car that I just painted.  Worked great, held up well.
B001Q8IXW2|5|Very inexpensive to use for one time applications.  This product holds up very well and for waxing or tire dressings.  When I'm done, I just throw it away rather than try to wash and reuse.  A clean car needs a clean applicator.
B0006MQJ0M|5|THANKS
B00HT2Y7ZG|5|Got one of these and put it in my husband's work truck. He smokes with the windows up and is in his truck alot. After running it for about 24 hours you couldn't tell he was a smoker at all. I was super impressed because my sense of smell is great
B007ISGJUC|5|...and lo and behold...THIS arrived, before the promised date.  Got 'em BOTH put in/on today!!!  Lookin' WAY forward to the 12 hp boost and improved MPG.
B0002Z9T1O|5|Ready for Winter.  During the summer, i pulled a 20 foot storage container with it.  Just don't forget the chock blocks.  (wink)
B003LIUWVU|3|Nice but the pin doesn't stay very well. Came out on the first ride.
B00FCC4YJO|5|Great size and Idea to be honest. Installation is simple and even comes with a great little carrying bag that serves me to store in my equipment bag. Shipping was done in a timely matter as well.
B010EUNSK4|5|Wow!! I purchased the Anker Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger Power Bank with 400A Peak Current, Advanced Safety Protection and Built-In LED Flashlight it's great, but this jump starter is even better. I have a1977 Fiat Sport Spider, and it has sat for almost a year while I have waited on parts, I put on the the Anker PowerCore Jump Starter 400 and the car immediately had the ability to start. (Now that was a dead battery.)<br /><br />I was supplied a sample of this Jump Starter. I promised to give an honest and fair review of this product.<br /><br />This Jump Starter also has an IQ usb port so that you can charge other devices. It also has a red flashlight an a white light and strobe.<br /><br />This Jump starter has starting current of 200 A with a peak currant of 400 A. It's size is 8.6 X 2 X 2 in and it weighs 19.2 oz. The finish is black with a matte finish.<br /><br />This Jump  Starter is a solid device and should last a long time if you take care of it. As always the 18 month Anker warranty and phone<br /> support is great.
B000W0WSPI|4|I purchased this to remove the fan clutch so that I could replace the water pump on a 2003 GMC Envoy with the I6 4.2L engine.  The tool is very well made and appears to be of a good quality, but it does not seem to work very well on the Envoy's (not Chevrolet Trailblazer, but GMC Envoy!) engine due to the bolt heads on the water pump pulley being in the way.  Even after removing the 4 bolts that secure the water pump pulley onto the water pump to make for more room, I still found it hard to maneuver the 2nd needed wrench to remove the fan clutch.  I used a large crescent wrench and it was so large it just could not make enough contact on the nut of the fan clutch.<br /><br />Youtube has an excellent video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hl2gaJHQY4) that shows a water pump replacement on a 2002-2009 Envoy and it displays the correct fan clutch wrench set to use at the 56 second mark of the video.  I think the fan clutch tool set they were using is this one on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U21INM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I am going to buy the aforementioned set and hope that is works better.<br /><br />I have had to purchase several specialized tools to maintain this vehicle (in this very case, approximately $75 worth) and in some situations, the price of the tools are more than the savings I get from completing my own repairs.  More misery involves the vehicle breaking down on my wife at the most inopportune time when she is by herself (nights, weekends, out of town trips) which required either a tow or some roadside repair by me to limp it home.<br /><br />Due to this fact as well as bad engineering, design, and quality of parts (both original/factory installed and replacement), I will never again purchase a General Motors product.  Once she is out of school and our finances are better, it will be immediately sold and replaced.
B006M6HHN4|3|The price for this chain was reasonable, wanted to see the material quality. Material quality seems medium grade, nothing fancy. I haven't installed the chain yet, using as a emergency back up.
B00GU7HUX2|5|Genuine GM PART.  The original the best
B00K5UD4I0|5|they work great
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Good
B0013REXO8|5|I purchased these for my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 10th Anniversary Edition. They give the Jeep a bit more of a rugged look and will also save the lights from an occasional wack of a tree branch.<br /><br />Be careful when installing them as they are side specific, I learned this after I installed them and had to do the job twice. Also be sure to use the screws provided, it does not look like you need to but if you don't the screws will wiggle out.<br /><br />From the picture they look like they are a cast metal piece but they are actually heavy stamped steel, A bit of a disappointment for me, but they are more than rugged enough.
B006X8BATI|5|Installing it was a breeze.  Looks like a factory part.  Why ford is not putting this item on their trucks is beyond me.
B003NDM1B2|5|worked super GREAT!!!!
B007TXYKB6|5|Easy to install, as good as OEM and excellent price.
B002ZTGMYM|5|A perfect fit! Just what I was hoping for!
B0009IK9EK|1|This product appears to be well made and heavy duty.  All I want to do with it is wash the car.  Unfortunately, it produces a weak solid stream and a non-existent uniform mist having enough force to rinse off a car after washing.  This is with my garden hose on full flow.  I have better results with a basic $3 nozzle from the local mass market retailer.  This is not due to a hose or home water flow problem as my 2500psi pressure washer performs fine around the house for heavy chores.  I can't even give this product 1 star, but Amazon makes me give it at least one.  Look for something else.........this is not it!!!!!!!!!
B00B8ZERBE|4|Great delivery and price is exceptional.  beyond that - Delivered as expected and product is as described, but nothing above and beyond my expectations.
B00N2ZFQ86|5|Perfect fit!! Easy to install!!
B00COAWGIS|5|Nice quality and value for the price. Fits Honda Shadow well with standoffs. Nice leather.
B000ELDJ30|5|I must say that I am VERY impressed!  After trying over 5 different brands over the years on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler- finally one that is perfect!<br />It is a little more expensive than the others, but WELL worth it!  It does take patience and time to install, but looks GREAT on!  After a couple of weeks it molds perfectly to the steering wheel for a great \\"feel\\" fit!  Would definitely recommend!!!
B000M5Y72A|2|Not any brighter or difference in color than a stock bulb.
B007WR25KW|4|These worked really well.  The place for improvement is the directions for putting them on the straps, as it took me quite awhile to get the loop on the side specified since it is suppose to be really important.
B00CF4ODNY|2|I was not very impressed with the quality of the hat. The stitching was poorly done.
B000ET5264|5|Works great, easy to use.
B00KTKNZPS|5|Works just fine on my '95 Toyota Avalon. Looks like the genuine Toyota part, made in Japan.<br /><br />I definitely needed a new one after 20 years. Part of the release mechanism was broken on the old one , but that wasn't what was causing my problem. After trying a lot of things, including changing the timing belt and water pump, I realized my problem was that I wasn't &#34;burping&#34; the radiator as I added coolant. If you've drained coolant from the engine, you have to keep squeezing the upper radiator hose as you add new fluid. This gets the air bubbles out. I had to burp it like these half a dozen times, or more, as I refilled. When you're done, the upper hose should feel full. Pretty basic, but I was not familiar with this type of cooling system where you don't fill right at the top of the radiator.
B000BTQMW0|5|I put this in a BMW and it worked fine and my customer is as pleased as I am now.
B00XNZSAWY|5|Looks clean. Very happy :)
B009PP5IBM|4|I've only used this a few times, but I can already tell this knife gives the user more control and leverage.  I also like being able to lock the blade in the intermediate position.
B00DEU1H6Y|5|The old lift support on my first Burgman was starting to get wimpy enough that you had to lift the seat and fuss with it to get it to stay up, and the support on my second Burgman wouldn't keep the seat up at all.<br /><br />I ordered one to see how it worked out and when I opened up the package I had received 2 supports!!!  What a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />The supports were easy to install, and now when I unlock the seat latch (most of the time) the seat pops open on it's own (which is just too cool).
B002I03ZIE|5|Exactly what I ordered and looks great with the black grille assembly
B003ETJPTG|4|Seems to work well, however, don't quite know if it's really any better than basic electrical tape, and it cost a bunch more for the amount you get.
B000BWNLU8|2|I really liked how this looked and i ordered it because it was cheap. It went on ok on my 2007 nissan sentra but i had to super glue it and then the super glue wore off and i delt with it. I went back to the stock one because 5 out of the 7 lights went out. Only Red and Green would go and then eventually the shift knob stopped working.. i wouldnt recommend it
B000ARPVO8|5|Great lube for pistols and rifles.  Very thick, so I'm applying it with a Q-Tip but stays in place and slides and bolts are very smooth.
B004YK3SME|5|works perfect
B007XE5LTG|5|Good
B0017OALKM|5|No problems. Just like the original. Easy to install (depending on the car of course). I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza hatchback and it literally took 3 minutes.
B000M8R0QM|1|I think this is a great little compressor but is completly useless unless you get the alligator clips that allow you to hook it up directly to your car battery. The socket that's supposed to plug into your car's 12v plug ( lighter ) is cheaply made and won't even plug into my car's recepticale.
B00JK6QLIU|5|Very nice item.
B007ITAHV8|5|I put this decal on the back window of my new truck after I sold my old vehicle and my beloved H/J sticker along with it. It's perfect...lets people know my passion in a subtle way without taking up too much space on the window. Was easy to apply and has stayed in place through multiple weather conditions, car washes, etc.
B00CBWL17G|4|very good
B00PTJFKVQ|5|Original mazda part.
B0002M7932|5|really quality mirror, hard to adjust as it should be for use outside, had to put it in a vise to move it. but once set it doesn't move or vibrate.
B0012FEX5K|5|I wrote Camco but have not heard back from them.<br /><br />Great idea poorlly executed.  I don't think I will replace it as it is sure to happen again.<br /><br />I plan to install a small computer fan inside and wire it to my DC panel and put it on a switch.  I'll only need it on hot days as my fridge works great in cool and cold weather.<br /><br />UPDATE:  CAMCO Sent me a new solar panel for this.  I'm very surprised and pleased. UPdating my rating from 1 to 5 stars.
B00PEFO30Y|5|Great money clip and good looking. I use it for money only. However, it's a clip that may hold other stuff such as credit cards, drivers license. I'm glad I bought this one because I am a Toyota fan!!
B000EQDQGK|3|Made my ride better on 04 GMC Canyon not the best in terms of comfort but is definitely better than worn out 10 year old oem shocks.
B00630N5EE|5|The remote was very easy to program and works very well
B007772J58|5|The adapter is exactly as it said it is and will do exactly what it is supposed to do. As far as installation it was not complicated at all and other than having to drill holes in an awkward position (field fit) was fine. According to the picture there should have been a wrench in the kit but that wasnt there. No problem for a farmer, as that size wrench was in the tool box in the shop. Although the instructions didn't say yes or no, a dab of loctite (removeable) was put on all 5 bolts and paint stripes were put on all bolts to visually quick check for movement. Checked after 1500 miles of towing and retorqued and nothing had moved.
B00KQPOUG4|5|Quality is good, size is good. Happy to have it.
B000C2E4HG|5|all good
B00252E782|5|GREAT product – worked as advertised. Thanks!
B002AP95H2|3|Inverter worked well for a year or so.. Used it on a few road trips.. Now the green light won't turn on, the fan still runs, and the 3 wall outlets don't work.  The only functional part of it now is the usb and the car charger outlet on the end.. Buyer beware , it was nice for the price, but I would not expect extreme longevity out of the unit..
B004DEBBPM|2|The extension was defective, the holes for the pins were offset, I had to bore them out in opposite directions (up and down) with my drill press and add weld  tacks to one side otherwise my receiver and kayak extender would have sat at a nearly 45 degree angle and it was sloppy, the weld tacks I added were to remove the slop so it wouldn't  move while turning as I drove.  I didn't bother to return it because I needed it when I received it, however after all of the work I performed on it made it functional which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 that it really deserved.
B0034H0N2G|4|My hands are always cold, and I've been riding with thinner gloves & liners. Still, I was barely able to feel my hands after long rides. So, I purchased these gloves hoping they would help, and boy did they! They are much thicker than my other gloves, and I rode to work yesterday in 35 degree weather (with the glove liners as well) and my fingers were still warm when I got to work! I would say that they would be great for 40+ degree weather, but if your hands get cold like mine, you'll still need glove liners if the temp is below 40. Because they are unisex, the small is a little large on me, but with the glove liners, they're almost perfect. I guess I just have smaller fingers, as the fingers are a little long.<br /><br />4/3/13 Update: I rode to work this morning in 45 degree weather without the glove liners, and my hands were cold when I arrived. Since my ride is only about 10 miles, I would think they should have been warmer upon arrival. So, downgrading my rating from 5 to 4 stars.
B001447VB2|5|I used this to polish a dulled nickel Colt detective Special and it now looks new. A friend also used it on a very old family pistol and it now looks much better.
B000K02EDG|5|GOOD DEAL!!!!
B006R1UGGY|1|Does not work and company is bad with communication.
B000KQ2FF2|5|A &#34;snap&#34; to install.  It took less than 10 minutes.
B00HFLGZKQ|5|Worked out great on our 2000 Saturn SL1.  Snapped in in less than 30 seconds and works great.  Price on Amazon was about half of what the local parts store wanted for the same item.
B0018KE8ZY|4|GOOD HALMET
B000EDUUL2|4|The jacks seem to be very sturdily built. I am using the jacks to support the rear end of a 12' flatbed trailer when I have it detached from my towing hitch, not as stabilizing jacks for an RV.  This is not the intended use and I need to figure out the best way to use them so the trailer doesn't tip backwards when I am loading it.  I do note that the package shows the jacks being used on grass, but the jacks themselves have a label stating that they should be used on a solid surface. Seems like a good safety practice.
B00445WD6G|4|Fit right and looks great
B004YA4Y8G|4|Love this helmet, for the price you cannot find one with as many features. Looks very cool (I got flat black), super comfortable, and lightweight. Ventilation is excellent. The modular design makes it a breeze to put on & take off. The inner slide-down sun shades are one of the main reasons I chose this model - there is nothing more convenient than being able to flip these down during a sunny day! No changing of visors between tinted & clear needed. Being in a rural / mountainous area with sometimes rapidly changing light, this again is so convenient.<br /><br />The red LED light in back gives me extra peace of mind when riding at night, it's another reason I decided to get this model. I plan to purchase the optional brake light module, that activates the light automatically when the brakes are applied. VERY cool safety feature - essentially the back of the helmet becomes a third brake light - highly visible!<br /><br />The clear face shield is *crystal* clear, and cleans & buffs easily with soft cotton & lens cleaner. Very scratch-resistant and bugs come right off. Nice wide field of view as well.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this helmet 4 stars and not 5 is because of the ventilation open/close panels. The ones on top and in the back of the helmet are great, the one just below the visor works well too. However, there are two smaller ventilation intakes (just below the one under the visor) that don't stay open or closed tightly. They feel a little flimsy - they should \\"click\\" in like the others, but they are a bit loose and slide way too easily. I need to modify them somehow so they are \\"stickier\\" - although I should not have to do that. Minor design flaw there.<br /><br />Comes with a soft helmet bag / cover as well, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommended!
B0077T23IO|5|These were a great product for a great price.  A small amount of assembly was required, but the instructions were very good.  No more paying for someone else to complete oil changes or routine repairs.
B001NAQTUQ|5|If you are looking at buying this filter you probably already know about K&N and what you are getting into. The fitment was fine and the filter comes with some basic directions, but not step by step. The filter arrives already oiled, however it is in a bag so the oil gets all over the outside rubber parts so expect to wipe it off. Great part and an easy increase in performance.
B000CO80MO|5|Fits great on my 2005 mitsubishi galant 2005, maybe the other reviewer put it on backwards.
B00P8DF6G2|5|At first I thought these felt thin, but they fit my Subaru nicely and work well.  Besides, why does something have to be heavy to work?
B007ROC5UU|1|Save your money.. Go to an autozone instead. Cheap plastic for ten dollars not worth it. The review requires four more words.. Nothing left to say.
B00ONGNGOE|5|Very well priced very well made
B0064C60P2|5|Beautiful on the back windscreen, especially if you position it so is visible through the rear view mirror. A bit cumbersome to put on, but well worth it when it is.  :D
B00NAOIQOK|2|I liked the black matt finish but did not fit in my 2007 gti mk5 like advertised. The locking tabs on the back side of the emblem didnt line up or fit the oem grill. I ended up plasti dipping all my emblems. They turned out AWESOME!!! No more spending money on upgrades or modifacarions that dont fit. I gave this a two because I like the vw logo.
B002IQ4RAI|5|very good, very comfortable , filled my expectations
B000UVUAFO|5|Excellent product it works as described
B00AOIM2CC|4|I am using it in a newer Ford Truck with an iPhone 5.  I had to setup the iPhone to use the static address for the wireless connection so I could use the dash command app and also use LTE for my other apps while traveling.  It works well but I found that you cant leave it in the truck without disconnecting it.  It draws down the battery.
B00I5UMIUW|1|Not nearly big enough for my KIA soul. They ripped at the seams and they were impossible to get on. They had no seat belt holes and they are thin and cheap. I wouldn't and won't suggest them and will never buy them or from this company again.
B000GU3KHO|4|I'm surprised at the relative quality of the cover with this kind of price. It covers the motorcycle well (the wheels are a bit exposed, but that's fine). I store mine under a roof, so I can't tell if it's water resistant, though.
B004I18SPQ|5|Very good replacement. Dealer quoted approx. $280.00, I saved at least $200.00. Worth it.
B002809YHU|5|Didn't think they would fit but Amazon said they would, found out they are usually Right. Will order another set,so I can put two per wheel. Now try to steal my wheels, low-life-thief.
B0013TM0Z0|3|Installed it because of a plugged heater core, not a good thing in Wisconsin this time of year. It would be nice if it had an adjustable heat element but it doesn't throw off enough heat to really matter. Because it's \\"hard wired\\" to the battery you need to remember to turn it off before leaving the vehicle. I will leave it installed after the real heater is fixed, it's nice to have instant heat but it won't keep your windows from fogging up.
B002G3OG6S|5|Great blades. They are cheap enough but get the job done. I bought these a few years ago and am now on my second pair. They last awhile. You can definitely tell when they are new as they wipe the windshield bone dry and very clear.
B00BI2QID2|5|Very convenient
B000GJH3AU|5|My mare used to trot as fast as possible and ignore my rein aids to slow down. I tried the exercises in this program and they were very helpful. My horse now has a lovely western jog, on a loose rein. Note that this is very western oriented and does not discuss riding on contact. I like Mr. Lyons' overall training philosophy that he talks about at the start of the DVD.
B000F6NV78|4|I was running another brand of 100watt bulbs in my older AUDI and then switched them over into my new Mercedes. One of the bulbs eventually blew and I replaced them with these. They are a quality bulb that gives off a nice crisp beam. The problem is that my car would shut down one side before the higher wattage could do any damage. As soon as I replaced them with bulbs of stock wattage, everything was fine. This company makes a 55watt version that would work better in a newer car. Go for the 100's if you have an older car or don't mind using an adapter. It's unfortunate that they didn't work out for me because thay are a good bulb, especially at such a low price.
B000W1XX4M|5|Exellent
B00829HBEE|5|I Installed this new Aisin fan clutch on my 2000 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner and the fan is quiet now without that annoying whirring noise that makes it sound like a MACK truck when accelerating. This Aisin is the 100% original fan clutch that came with the truck new. ALWAYS install this fan clutch on your Toyota if it has the 5VZ-FE V6 engine and LEAVE all other generic fan clutches behind! My mechanic put a cheap Chinese made Hayden fan clutch and my fan would always stay on making a REALLY LOUD whirring noise during the summer eating up more of my fuel and giving my truck weaker acceleration. Not surprised since mechanics usually use worse quality replacement parts anyway. Installation was a snap and only required a 12mm wrench to get the clutch off the pulley and a 10 mm socket wrench to remove the nuts that connected the clutch to the fan. I'm very glad to have found the OEM fan clutch here on Amazon! Thanks, Aisin! Saved me from having to go to the dealer and pay a fortune for it.
B00EEDWMT6|5|Looks awesome, I get a lot of compliments
B000WJIDC6|5|Works great
B001DKTG0G|4|I gave it 4 stars cause it's for manual transmission that require &#34;AUTOMATIC&#34; transmission fluid. But other then that it's royal purple ain't no better oil out there
B006R0XYGY|5|These lights look nothing like the stock lights. They are brighter and have a blueish glow, which I personally think makes it better.
B00062YUUS|5|Simple to use,large display.This worked great for checking the dwell on my VW sandcar.Would recommend for anyone who wants to check there points or rpm on there engine.Much better price here at Amazon than going to Auto zone.
B009DJQ1BQ|5|Perfect replacement for the 2000 Jeep Cherokee fan shroud.
B005VKLGUW|4|Came as picture, good like the oem
B0012S9A5U|5|This tool makes short work out of exhaust hanger removal and it works better than prying with screwdrivers. It seems to be good quality. The only con is that I will probably never use it again.
B004HL37RG|1|Weak Weak Weak!!!!!.  I have had it for about a month and it has ripped along the seams.  This material is worthless for a cover. Very dissatisfied with this item. I bought it because of the name brand, have had many Rugged Ridge products and the name meant quality, Not this time.
B00RQY5H74|5|Great MX pants.Fully satisfied.Great style and confort.
B000KYX24C|4|I purchased a key fob from this company and the dealership could not get it to work.  After posting a negative review, I immediatly received a call from the company.  We reviewed the numbers on the back of the fob, as there are several for my car. I am returning it and we are trying a new one.  He also agreed to fix two older fobs that I have and get them ready for programming next time I need it.  This company stands by it's promise and, as someone trained in customer satisfaction, it is pleasant to see that.
B00B7QLESS|2|spout fits my 1970s all metal jerry can perfectly. spout could be a little longer, but is bendable so you can pour the can multiple different ways, little tough lifting the full can up to my lifted ford. spout comes with a gasket which is great, these rubber gaskets go for $5/each here on amazon plus $5 shipping. great buy, great product.<br /><br />UPDATE: After only 2 uses the spout came apart from the cap. taking back my \\"great buy, product\\" comment. Will look for a replacement.
B004GCDZV4|5|My '99 Dakota was showing it's age. Along with other cosmetic issues, the bumper had a corner that rotted out due to some damage that had gone unnoticed until it actually rusted through. Figuring the truck isn't going to last another 15 years, I opted for this replacement rather than spending the big bucks for one from the Dodge dealer. The metal is somewhat thinner than the originals but it doesn't look or feel cheap. The hardest part of the installation was getting past the rusted bolts and brackets. After that, along with new brackets and bolts, everything lined up perfectly and it looks new again. Very pleased with the purchase!
B007A3HIE6|3|I have used the Chatterbox XBI set for years and took a chance on the Midland, I am not as happy with the Midland.
B004PZK14G|4|Seats are good quality stitching could be better.  I had a problem with a seam ripping on one of the front seats.  If there was a higher grade thread used or a double seam I feel like it would hold much better.  But these covers make the interior look sharp.  I have a 2015 Wrangler.  The covers fit well. Installation is easiest with two people but possible with one.  I slid a plastic bag in when applying the front seats because the Velcro will make installation impossible if not.  All in all great way to protect the Jeep while making it look sharp.
B000QJG1HG|5|great product, sound sweet, my snake breaths easier now.  should have put these on<br />years ago.  flowmasters for all my cars.
B006WASF2M|5|Good product, exactly as listed. Husband was happy, would buy again!
B00AYIY9DM|5|In the cold my window broke the factory clip, and I sure wasn't going to pay the money a dealer would want.  I took me about an hour, but with these and a couple youtube videos, it's pretty simple to fix a window on your own.
B002JQBDC2|5|I had a hard time finding an adapter for my dust collection hose. I then read somewhere that this was one that is needed for a Fein vacuum. It works perfectly making the transition from the vacuum to my cyclone dust separator. Easily disconnected if necessary.
B003TV36JY|5|They preform perfectly at a fraction of the price most stands go for. Very well made and very sturdy.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Though we just have little knowledge about how a mechanic does their work but with this at hand it helps us to do the job.  It will pinpoint you to the bottom of the problem.  Nice software
B0024NSYYU|5|Obviously, this product is way better than the stock headlight you get with your car. When the headlight is on, it is very bright with low beam that turning on your high beam you don't really notice it that it is on. The only drawback is that it is not going to take you 10 minutes or 20 minutes for you to replace it with your old headlight assembly. This product is not perfectly made such that you will have to cut this or that to make them fit into your car. I am glad I had my mechanic put them in for me. They actually had to bend part of my fender to put them in. Right now, my hood is not closing all the way as it did before, even though it is latching and locking. However, my car looks great with a new and clean set of headlight assembly. :) The only thing is I don't know how to tell my fellow drivers on the road that I don't have my HIGH BEAM on but the low beam only. Almost every other week, drivers signaling me with their high beam to turn off my high beam when I don't have it on at all. LMAO. :)<br /><br />It arrived as described and in timely fashion. I would recommend this product to anyone who is good with their tools and has experience replacing car parts. Don't believe every car is made the same way. They are all different in some ways.
B00CU7529A|5|It is a good replication of one I picked up at a concert years ago. It's black and sticks were I needed it.
B000OR18BE|5|I love this tote tank. Its easy to tow behind any vehicle as well as easy to pull manually. I really like the side release. It makes emptying it easy, quick & no mess.
B001U60T9U|5|I have a 2012 Black Nissan Sentra . The covers fit my seats like a dream. Very easy install. I did it on my own, no partner required. Fabric and fit look like they cost much more than $30. Would definitely buy again.
B000CNBPQ8|2|If you drive a race car you may want these. If you drive a truck, they lasted around 15,000 miles on my truck. IN THE REAR???? My other pads lasted 60,000. at less than half the price and they are rear brakes so there is no \\"considerable difference\\". Performance yes, I guess. Practicality... uh, NO.
B000T9LZDI|5|I use  the whole Flitz product line for my cleaning and shining stainless steel and other surfaces that can be shined.  The Flitz polish-paste shines many surfaces and just a dab of the polish will go a long way.  Try it and you will see.
B002YK78VI|5|Easy to use and was able to replace and change out all 6 spark plugs. Had no issues on using it with my 2009 335i sedan.
B000BZI218|5|Excellent part
B00DSVMCT0|5|Good fit and looks great
B00BEIUM78|4|Like everyone is saying, sizes are smaller then they should be, I  have over 15 helmets and all XL  but this one is snug. But very cool looking and light weight which I  was looking for for the summer. The lack of instructions to replace shields is dissapointing but all in all a good deal
B00KLY15UE|2|Makes the seat belt too heavy and the belt gets closed in the door.  They look nice tho!  I took them off.  Maybe I will use them<br />in the back seat.
B00CIC3Y24|5|It works for Verizon Fios backup.  it was easy to install.
B0040D2QVE|3|I wanted the bigger clips these are the small ones like size of dime
B000M5ZWBA|1|advertised as up to 28 volts. package reads 6-12. maybe I can change out the bulb.
B0048E6LE8|5|Seems to fit good, even without using velcro
B006FYE2BS|5|Worked perfectly as described.
B0001EFSUC|3|Nice product by itself, but if you are like me and just got this product after hearing David Hobby saying that it is safe to get this one through airport security - forget about it. I just got it confiscated last week in the Israeli airport handbag security check.
B0001XPC7C|4|You will naed super glue<br />After I opened from the box has been broken
B0084XOWX6|1|terrible product
B000O80AZS|5|Could have been a little bigger
B002OUQIAA|5|we haven't used it yet but I'm sure it will atleast let me sleep better at night knowing that our RV will be ok.
B00BYNJANU|5|Great item wish they would include directions of boot down or up for the weekend mechanic.
B0002U70FQ|5|It's hilarious!  I got this for my sister who was a vegan for like 3 or 4 years and who decided that there are animal by-products in pretty much everything and she wasn't making an impact in how animals are treated.  She loves it and displays it on her car.  She was also excited to show it off to a friend of hers who is a hippie.
B003CEFJ2A|2|I bought this cover to go on a jack on my jeep, it looks nice. It took quite a bit to get it onto the jack, some of the threads broke in it, and the ones that didn't break are severely strained. I expected better quality.
B006R34PB4|5|They are bright and look good.I used them as side marker and glove box lights on my cherokee and neon.
B003XIX7JC|5|Description for this product is incorrect.  It lists 13\\" to 17\\" TV's.  Should read 13\\" to 27\\". go to Jensendirect.com for correct description.
B00BNVJYMU|5|I SAID THANK YOU FOR MUCH.
B00GQOGQMA|4|perfect all u need to wire in the led
B001VNGRC0|1|It will take waiting for spring for the smell to leavethese, and some of the items that were supposed to come in the package were taken out to sell separately.
B000XLXWQ0|5|I bought this bag about 2 years ago.  It works great.  It keeps everything together, Lock and keys, ball grease, wrench and hitch.
B0031BMUUI|5|very happy with purchase
B00O6WPVXY|1|Manufacture B grade defective junk. Don't try and save a few bucks here on junk
B00L3ENMBG|4|Good
B004VVO19K|5|Great product, good fitment
B003VXRPL0|5|Good stuff. Used in my E46. Old fluid came out dark/dirty red. This was a clear gold color.<br />It's fine it's not blue, was able to easily tell then it was done anyway.<br /><br />To E46 DIY'ers, you may want 2 bottles of this. Just for top-ups, and if you over-bleed it.<br />I was able to use exactly 1 bottle my first try and I got out all the old stuff.<br />Buy it!
B00IFC5FGY|5|I've been detailing cars for over 20 years and I'm here to tell you now that this is the best wax I have ever used hands down easy to wipe off super deep Luster and very little dust. If you want the best wax made order now!!!!
B008HRZPXU|5|Looks awesome
B0012TZ1RU|5|Item as described. Works great. Thank you.
B000FJU8L2|5|My gas gauge did not work on this 1976 dodge motor home that I am fixing up and the gas gauge just would not work. I did everything I could think of but I could not fix It!! Now I am OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CPGGZNS|3|This item is super bright but its really big and bulky when you put it on your windshield. So make sure its something that you want because in order to send it back i had to spend $10 dollars to send it back to the company. Also the product is plastic not metal
B001JT3G5M|4|A gift for my son, and he likes it.
B00U2IKC3K|5|Great product
B000E4LW8Q|1|I ordered a driver side mirror for my SUV.  When the order arrived, it came in a box that had printed on it that it was a driver side mirror.  Someone had written in pen over this and indicated that it was actually a passenger side mirror.    Bottom line, I ordered a driver side mirror and I received a passenger side mirror. This is of no use to me.    I emailed the seller clearly articulating the situation.  Despite this, they emailed me saying they needed me to confirm my issue. I did this and sent another email and also included my phone number.    Over a month went by and I heard nothing.  So, I called. The person who answered was very friendly and said he would immediately take care of it and have a new mirror sent out.  This was over two weeks ago and I have heard nothing and recieved nothing.    At this point, our registration is now expired as replacement of this mirror was necessary to pass inspection.  My wife has now been pulled over and luckily given only a warning.  I have no choice now but to purchase the item again from another vendor as I can't waste any more time with this poor customer service.
B007ZD675W|2|This is a good quality product but  - - - it creates a problem with the power windows ( at least on my 2013 f-150 ).  If you use the automatic \\"full up\\" feature on the power windows, when the window \\"hits\\" the full up position it thinks it is hitting an obstruction and cycles back down. This will happen over and over again. You can correct this operation by only pressing the up switch lightly and using the manual UP mode. These switches are very touchy and it is difficult to engage only the manual mode if the truck is in motion. It can be done, but takes some practice. There was no explanation of this problem in the product information or instructions. In short it is really a hassle and hardly worth it. I almost gave up and took them out, but am trying to live with it because I like the look and advantages of the deflectors.  I wish WeatherTech would have been more up front about this.
B000PDNOKK|5|Just super and for the price can't be beat.  So much better than a tow strap.  I has more give and makes towing much easier.
B00A9OO8R8|5|excelente, tal cual como en la imagen, despacho en las fechas anunciadas, 100% recomendado, la mercancia llego impecable sin rasguños ni rayaduras
B00EQQIUGK|4|Great product. We'll worth the money, very easy to install. You can definitely tell the difference from the stock intake. I can even hear a difference in my exhaust sound, it has a little better rumble to it. I would recommend this to anyone wanting that little extra boost. 2013 silverado 1500
B000C7NNVY|1|The part arrived quickly.  Once I got everything all apart, and then put it all back together, the new piston was to large to fit in the cylinder.  I took it to a machine shop and they measured the old piston and the new one, and it was much bigger.  Like .025 to big.  So now I will have to find the right piston and just eat the cost of the piston that didn't fit.  Beyond that, the part was shipped quickly and looked like a brand new piston.
B0006MTRJ2|4|This works well for what we needed it to do.
B001B08IAM|5|a minni air freshner is great to carry in my purse.  often when I am sick in someone else's home I can have it with me to save myself from fowling the air so those who come after are not offended.  I am grateful that someone told me that such a product existed.  I always said those big ones are just too big and someone should invent a purse sized one.  and they did . Thank God.
B005NXLR9C|5|I give it a five star, It's a great product and I am satisfied with it and the service is great.
B00318NQFY|1|They warn you that these bulbs are shorter life than other bulbs and they mean it. I got about six months out of one, and that's with the vehicle not used much at night since my daughter has it at college and doesn't even use the car during the week.
B000A8QLUA|5|These are amazing replacement plugs for my BMW.  NGK is all I use, and since I didnt have that much cash for a the more expensive ones, I bought these, and I must say, I think Im sticking with these from now on.
B004O42LXC|5|love it
B000CO9U3C|5|I installed it in a matter of 45 minutes probably would have taken less time if it wasn't for being 5 degrees out it seemed to pick up speed a little quicker haven't had it long enough to see difference in gas but overall shipped fast and had all pieces need! No complaints here!
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works great! Even better price
B000GUV0MQ|1|I purchased the 'manual' to find instructions for removing the battery and for fixing the wipers that remain in the up position.  Each of these is a fairly simple process and eAutoRepair did not help to resolve either one.    A search for \\"battery\\" returned over 40 headings with no clear indication of which to use.  An hour of plugging through the headings return NOTHING.  Maybe they consider this to be too simple to address, but I have read many caveats elsewhere about the posts on sidepost batteries being easily broken and wanted specific information to avoid the problem.    My second chore was to fix a problem with my wiper blades being stuck in the up position.  Again, other sources cite a problem with a tab that often gets bent and simply needs to be straightened out.  I was hoping to find a diagram specific to my vehicle to help with repair.  The only topic I could find required following about 6 steps, each of which involved checking voltage and none of which helped resolve the problem.    Maybe a mechanic would find this product helpful, but as a DIY owner it was useless.  The search was not helpful.  Navigation often landed me back to a screen offering to add a new vehicle - at additional cost, of course.    I wasted over 2 hours with the product in addition to the $9.99 cost.
B002QSPDYW|5|Thick heavy duty recovery strap. Have not had a chance to use it yet, but the strap seems as though it will be more than enough strap to handle any job. I also purchased a 2&#34;x20' from a local farm store to keep in my ATV.
B000EDQR50|5|just what I needed for my RV
B006O0F7OE|5|Ever thing worked like it was new
B00CO8UENY|5|Really nice! works well charging my GPS and it all charges both of our phones and our Kindles as well.
B004JBI6C0|5|easy to install and a lot cheaper than the dealer.
B0002SQZPY|3|Looks like a useful tool but it doesn't work on a Subaru 4 cylinder turbo engine. The problem is that this tool needs the cam sprocket notches to come to the edge of the sprocket. On the Subaru only one of the sprockets has this.
B00VBPKII2|4|Nice set.
B000QUXZ0Q|5|my old socket in my 2000 ford windstar looked burned up, and I suspected it was the problem behind several burned out bulbs.  Replaced with this one in a few seconds and it worked fine.  Easy installation.
B00A9UXOJ0|5|I bought these stickers just to load up my tool box with color, cant beat it for the price and quantity
B00008RW9U|4|Pretty good, although it does leave very small red fibers on the car. Hardly noticeable but, I recommend not brushing to hard with it. Just do lite, short strokes.
B004TMHNW8|4|Fits, easy to install. Good price
B00SHF5Z64|5|Came fast, super easy to install. fits snugly and feels good. 100% satisfied
B000G3KRQ8|3|Made in china now not italy as they used to be.So i expect them to die in three months or so.China Sucks!
B000UXV9VG|4|I have a 2009 Mercedes C300.  It fits perfectly and does what it is supposed to--keeping the car a lot cooler, although I don't know by how many degrees.<br /><br />While it does roll up, it is awkward to do in while seated in the car.<br /><br />It does the job I needed done:  keeping my car much cooler when parked in the sun.
B008R95GA0|5|Many regard seat belt extenders as products for people suffering from obesity. Of course, they're great for that, but they also come in handy for people no longer possessing fine motor skills. My elderly parents are in the latter category, and on a recent visit, I noticed that it took my father at least five minutes to latch his seat belt. I ordered this product and had Amazon ship it directly to his house. My parents are thrilled. Now my father latches his seat belt in a matter of seconds, and I have peace of mind knowing that he is securely in the driver's seat. The only issue is what type to order. There are only two types, A and B. If the tongue on your seat belt is less than one inch wide, it's type A (which is just about every car). I highly recommend this product.
B00AOIM2CC|4|Whenever you order this, it is brokered so the item is not physically in the US. You will receive a package directly from China and takes a long time. But it worked flawlessly. Plugged it in, mapped to the wifi, fired up Dash Commander and was set....doesn't get much simpler...after waiting such a long time to receive it is worth....now just see how long it last..
B00UC4HZXO|3|Not aligned correctly where the 2 ends are located.  Needs to be put together better.
B004W4MCA6|1|Don't buy these had for less than a year driver side halos Already burnt out, and the h1 headlight bulbs they replace stock with are garbage and burn out all the time, very poor quality control
B003RQBKLC|5|I used this product when I drove from Colorado to Texas so I could charge my phone. It worked perfectly. Thanks so much!
B008J83IP4|1|Amico Name is short for thanks for your money sucker one burnt out in milli seconds that fast the other one didn't work at all.
B0000AX60X|4|Acceptable
B001FZL9ZO|3|I bought this on a whim it's a great sturdy product that does its job. The lights work great and it's holds my fat behind @ lbs 275 !!
B00EYW1GB2|5|Good
B0073WEZU4|5|looks great, works fine in the city, not so much in rural areas but I have Sirius so I don't need antenna often
B0017H9N4E|4|This hitch mount carrier is made of aluminum, so is very light.  Easily lifted and installed by one person (but easier to do with two to get the hitch pin lined up).  The carrier looks very nice as the cross slats are some sort of polished / shiny material.  The rating indicates it can carry 500lbs, but we easily carried about 200lbs on it.  Little wind influence, unlike car roof top rack carriers.  The only negative to note was that one of the tack welds on a vertical support (to the 6 inch high top rail) was broken when it was delivered.  We were leaving on a trip the next day, so I was able to repair temporarily with a large sheet metal screw.
B00FGI81FW|5|I bought this for my husbands man cave. He placed it under a corvette sign (same script) it looks great. It was packaged well, arrived on time and in good condition. I would buy products from Midwest Corvette again.
B00LGIREX6|5|Works great as an extra brake light, looks awesome. Shipping was a little slow, but what do expect when it's coming halfway accross the world! Would purchase again!
B000KL128S|5|Having never replaced a car radio, I made sure to order this harness to adapt to the OEM plug. I would have been crazy not to. The colors matched my wires on the new radio, all I had to do was connect them and plug it in. The harness on the Hyundai is very short, and would have been a pain to cut wires on. Spend the few dollars and save the headache.
B00JFZA3OO|5|Perfect. Just what i ordered may have to order another one to fit my hubby's scope.
B009APMGNU|4|Not as durable as their 661 Chevron Gloves, but better than the 661 Raji's. Bought them for AM and XC type riding and they are very comfortable, but the palms are wearing thin after a couple dozen uses and washings. They are my favorite trail gloves just wished they had a better palm material. Will buy again when on sale.
B006T0J1FA|4|Nice product
B001O2T43M|5|very good quality and comunication with the vendedor and quality perfect piece tools and screws an bunch tools excelents qu
B000182FFO|1|they said it was the step board but it is not its just the kit thats all
B0000AY2BR|5|Works as I expected
B00062YA80|5|I was getting tired of rebuilding my 1995 vintage 4-barrel Carter/Weber carburetor every season or two. Each rebuild kit was around $80. So I researched my replacement options and chose the Edelbrock 1409 Marine Series Carb. Some reviews said that right out of the box the motor would run fine. They were right. All I had to do was adjust the idle speed slightly. Boat runs great.
B00JYJ86MC|2|The hinge reduced my visibility. I think the bottom should flip up instead of the top down. After on 2 rides it is all scratched up from branches rubbing against it. I gave it a 2 star because the fitment was great.
B000E4VPQU|4|Had to use a few parts from the original mirror as this one didn't quite fit 'as is' on our '79 convertible Beetle, but that seems to be typical with after-market parts. Ultimately this mirror worked fine as a replacement to the original.
B00IS604LI|5|Good quality, looks nice, it deserve to buy , i loved it !
B0041MKEJA|5|I installed in the front of (one on each side) of my aluminum trailer where I carry my MTO AutoGyro. Inmone of them I have my helmets, headphones and portable radio. And in the other one the tools, oils, etc. Perfect size and well made.<br />And for the price...a perfect buy.
B00008BKX5|4|The Xtend-o-Truck is a huge hit with me and my buddies.  It's a perfect accessory for fun and recreation.  We used to recreate with just a tow rope behind the pickup, but this here gadget is a lot easier and a lot more fun!    My buddy Lucas Tubbs used to work down at the RV repair shop.  They up and fired him for livin in the RVs that was parked on the lot.  When a new RV come in for fixin he'd move his liquor and pot pies into it and stay there till the next RV came in and then move again.  I don't think they'd have caught him neither if he didn't keep takin the RVs out on grocery runs.  He should have known that if he was drivin them RVs when he shouldn't be, sooner or later he'd wind up high centered on top of a pretzel stand in front of the baseball stadium and he'd have a world of explainin to do.  It's just a matter of time and probabliabilities.  Anyway, as he was leavin the repair shop for the last time he stoled all them rollin dolley gadgets that they use to slide under the RVs and brought them back to the trailer park for us to play with.    We made up a game then usin these dolley thingies called Bump-the-Bed (it aint as naughty as it sounds).  Lucas or me drives the pickup truck through the park and tows someone behind who's ridin on one them dolley thingies (it's like water skiing without the water or the skis).  I don't get down to the lake much cause of the whole house arrest thing, so this is the perfect way for me to recreate.  Anyway, the game was to drive over the speed bumps in the park at just the right speed, then slam on the brakes.  That way whoever's ridin behind hits the speed bump, flies into the air, and (if you're playin the game right) lands in the bed of the pickup.  You get extra points for doin fancy tricks while you're in the air.  You have an old matress or inflatiated kiddie pool there in the bed of the truck to catch them.  Old cans or bottles work pretty good too.  Except you don't want them glass bottles ... I have to admit that I shoulda thought that through better before loadin up the truck bed with them empty Budweiser bottles.    The problem with Bump-the-Bed usin a tow rope then was that if you weren't hittin the speed bump just right dead straight, the person bein towed missed the bed of the pickup.  There'd be too many times when I'd hit the bump, slam on the brakes, then hear this thud right next to where my driver's door would be if I had one.  I don't know how, but one time I actually managed to get my cousin Teeter all the way over my truck bed and into the driver's seat of that convertible FireBird in Clifford McNaugher's yard!  We tried a good 5 or 6 more times to do it again, but that was a one in a million shot and Teeter was startin to act a little screwey so we stopped.  He was yellin stuff about \\"Green Sharks\\" fightin \\"Blue Sharks\\" and his left foot kept turnin around facin backwards, so we knew he'd had enough fun for one day.    ... but I digest ... I'm sposed to be talkin about the Xtend-o-Truck.  Now that we have this Xtend-o-Truck, the person on the back is always lined up straight!  So, when we hit the speed bump he (or she if the girls aint too warn down from the mornin sickness) always flies just one direction: straight toward the truck.  We learned pretty fast that you need to do a little hop right before the truck stops though.  Otherwise you just wrap your bodily middle sections around the crossbar of the Xtend-o-Truck and it takes a day or two to walk upright and propper again.  If you time it just right you can use the bar to sprang up in the air and do some amazin flips and poses before hittin the truck!  I even got a few new dents in the HOOD of my truck from Lucas sprangin off the crossbar just right!    Now I should probably say here that I don't condom other folks playin Bump-the-Bed (even with the Extend-o-Truck) cause we're semi-perfesionals at this sport and you other folks who aint as practiced in the finer points of self-pervesation may get yourself gimped up if you was to try it.  At least don't attempt it without propper safety gear.  Wear a cup to protect your vitals.    The only complaint I have about this fine product then is that the Extend-o-Truck is sold one at a time, but it's obvious that the manufactuerers intend you to buy at least 2.  It's a little misleading ... like selling only on Bagmitten racket at a time.  You can't fully enjoy the game until you buy the second Bagmitten racket, and you can't play their \\"Capture the Red Flag\\" game without a second truck and Extend-o-Truck.  Why would they include this red flag if it wasn't to tease you into buyin the second Extend-o-Truck?  One of them sly marketing ploys.  Once we get another Extend-o-truck and Teeter gets his pickup runnin again, we're gonna be off to the Walmart parkin lot to play.  We would play here in the trailer park, but the speed bumps would make it just too difficult.  You'd be speedin along, catchin up to the other truck, reachin out, just about to grab the other truck's red flag and win the game, when BOOM ... SPEED BUMP and you're wrapped around the cross bar of the Extend-o-Truck so tight that they have to pry you off with a crow bar.    All in all, a great product ... I know we're gonna buy at least 1 more as soon as possible.
B000EDOTCI|5|I bought one for inside the house and the other for the motor home, I am going to put both inside the house and order a third one for the motor home. It is eacy to put up, easy to fill and so convenient.
B0000AXY62|4|I like this, it works and keeps my vehicle hitch secure no matter the attachment. I would make the same purchase if I had it to do again.
B0007VCL22|5|Pain to install because the holes from the receiver didn't align with those on my truck (my trucks fault). Once installed, it's rock solid and works perfectly.
B00E6G4FK0|5|Good product and service
B00267PXOS|5|This seat went together easily and handily supports my 225# butt. Rolls well & the hydraulic height adjust works fine. Seems like a very good deal as well. No regrets.
B000E8XFPU|1|I lost one engine on my toyota using a pure one filter. Spun a bearing and cooked a piston due to oil starvation. These filters I have read across the web have restriction problems ( poor flow due to too dense of media) especially at low speeds and idle when your bypass valve is closed and you depend on oil flowing through the dense media. I built another engine and used the Bosch Distance Plus filter ( which is close to the pure one filter since Bosch owns purolator) and sure enough, the top end was clacking and ticking and their was a knock emanating from the oil pump area. Put a Fram Tough Guard on it and now the new engine has NO NOISE !!!! I may stick with the Fram even though I have read the stories about paper end caps; most people I know have never had a problem with Fram.
B000X20HC6|5|Fits great and looks great.  They do a wonderful job and high quality. Perfect for your truck or SUV. Get one!!
B007PLQYXO|5|perfect replacement, I wish I can do the same for my truck.
B0023GM2KK|5|I have used this product before for many years each time I do a differential oil change, which is every couple of years depending on use and auto mileage. I always use a rear end cover gasket and film coat of this stuff when I put the cover back on.  Never have had any problems, no leaks, no noises, just a smooth glide ride through all the years, with different cars by using quality auto products and something so simple as regular maintenance.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Bought one of these for my wife.  She didn't love it, so it went in my car.  No more lost wallet.  Then I got a new car and had to buy another pair after losing my wallet down the seat gap again (my son got the old ones with the old car, only because I forgot they were there)  They completely solve the problem of losing things from your pocket into the unreachable gap.  Kind of expensive for what they are, but they work really really well.
B0009IBJCQ|1|Not what I thought it would be the clamps and wires leading to the clamps are not as heavy gauge as my previous one which is the same make as this one  it seems that they cheapen this one up some. CHARGED MY DEEP CYCLE BATTERY AND THE CHARGER GOT SO HOT YOU COULD NOT TOUCH IT PLUS THE CABLES WERE JUST AS HOT. TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS NORMAL AND HOW I COULD RETURN IT. HAVEN'T HAD ANY LUCK. CAN SOMEONE HELP.
B003O7D512|5|This is a great truck and the perfect size for me. I commute to work with my motorcycle and this allows me to put my backpack in it and off my back, or I can wear the backpack and haul other things.<br />Great addition to my motorcycle!
B007WZS41I|4|Good for the price. Easy to set up in my 2012 Town and Country
B000CB0KOI|5|It fit my car as stated. There are a few different sizes for this style belt and it would have been a easy mistake to make. but they got it right. Which was a great relief.
B000GVF76A|5|I've other Motion Pro tools and this kit, in keeping with the theme, isn't junk--just like their other tools. Awesome.
B006X8CRVI|3|little bit difficult to install, needs some minor adjustments and cutting
B003EO3VJQ|4|I wanted brighter headlights without blowing a wad of cash on Silverstars and to give me time to save for a decent set of HIDs . Granted, Hipros generally don't last as long as sylvanias, but they're so much brighter. Plus the headlights look awesome when they're off with the blue reflection. I have the same ones on my '03 B&lt;W 330Ci and they've lasted longer than expected.<br /><br />The difference between stock and these is amazing, especially with the brights on. For the fog lights I got yellow lights from iJDMtoy that also really cut through heavy fog out here in Washington state.<br /><br />This is a great price to replace all your stock bulbs.
B00B28S8GC|5|This lift was really well, easy install, nice ride and fantastic look. The quality is impressive and for the price you honestly can't beat it
B001E221A0|5|This project took me longer to sweep out the bed than it did to install. Less than 10 minutes to tighten it in place, AND it clears my 5th wheel hitch perfectly.<br />This was mounted on a 2013 2500 GMC Sierra Extended Cab with the 6 1/2 foot bed.<br />Love it!
B00139YMUQ|5|It is accurate, simple to use and a plus to have in the car.<br />All petrol stations have very inaccurate gauges and it is very handy to have a portable one to compare with.
B0046BLB3Y|2|I purcahsed these mats because it said they fit cars and SUVs, I drive a Ford Escape and these do not fit my car, they are wayyy to small.<br /><br />the mats are gourgeous for a betty boop fan, but make mor than sure they fit your car before purchasing them.
B0046NJOR2|5|perfect fit. quick delivery.
B0049HRJYU|5|This product is working great.  Not to bad to install.  I installed it in my 08 cobalt.
B002RT6IO4|5|These are so cute and they fit great. Very comfortable. Very stylish. They have a chain and a charm that hang off the back that you don't see. Not sure these shoes needed that extra embellishment. I'll probably cut it off. But otherwise, these shoes are awesome.
B008JHF2D6|5|Great way to class up the Beamer.
B009FTLONE|2|I had problems with one of the LED's not fitting the socket properly which caused ground issues essentially making the light &#34;full on bright&#34; and not functioning with the indicator.  When trying to remove that bulb from the socket to make it fit better the bulb broke in half.  To verify it wasn't the socket I put a Halogen 1157 back in and it worked fine and have now replaced with a different brand LED which also works fine.<br /><br />I will add the passenger side bulb which had no issue was very bright and functioned as it should.  I needed a &#34;No Load Flasher&#34; for my turn signal indicators to work though
B008LUT6XS|5|It is great.
B003ZJ16K6|5|Fits and hold very well
B00JAABQ4A|5|Great oil filters!
B0041DX8JW|5|Great part , great service, Thanks !
B007TNOXKY|5|Tool quality is very good, well designed and made of really strong material, a bit expensive but worth of investment.
B007M8SRGC|5|Sipping took forever and a day but to be somewhat expected from out of the country.... quality product!
B005GLQCKA|5|I use this when replacing pad on my 370Z Sport. I have 4 piston calipers and this tool made it a whole lot easier to push the pistons back in to remove and replace the pads.
B000H7CJAK|4|Just got my new Jet Ski Battery delivered, cant wait to put it on and get out on the water. I will have too though, as way down below the product is the note to say not including acid. It would have been nice to have that up front with the title. Great delivery service though so no problem there.
B000L7JQE8|5|OTC 4676 worked great removing the original 15 year wipers.
B0084UK2X8|5|The best floor mats I ever bought
B006R7AAQO|5|Great color match
B00KRH1JKQ|5|These lights are fantastic. They are made well, and were easy to install.
B006KHL0SS|5|good bead blaster.  saved me a lot of ethanol lol.  if you have a shop and do a fair amount of tires you need this.  saves a lot of time on those stubborn, cold, thin tires
B001FAK4B4|5|These handles look great, are very solid, and can be used in a variety of ways in a JK Wrangler(back of seat handles, pillar mount, etc.). Great quality of materials and rugged styling, which is what every item I've gotten from Rugged Ridge has been so far.
B004YMAC8U|5|Very difficult to install but look amazing!
B00173U7D4|5|Wonderful product.  Can be used in the kitchen or the bathroom.  It is pure citrus with NO<br />artificial chemicals or perfumes.
B00HVI1468|4|PRO:  I like that it protects my key fob.  The rubberized coating helps me to feel for it in the dark as I approach my car.<br />CON:  It's minor, but the rubber will catch in your pocket as you pull your keys out.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I bought it.
B009Z283VC|2|The pre drilled holes are not for the Suzuki Volusia 800 - K9 model.<br />Had to drill new holes to match existing OEM brackets.
B006RYVULG|5|Bought this set with no hopes. I wanted a whiter look and I got it . Bulbs look great. I hope future purchasers have my luck too
B00M9SHK90|5|This is awesome, as described, error free and it looks cool with that bright white color. Thanks, Great work from this seller and I will buy again.
B00A740VQM|5|I needed not contact the seller because the products arrived in the time promised, everything was perfect
B000WEKQ3K|5|The floormats that I purchased were a great fit and worked very well in keeping the mud from duck hunting off of the carpet. My sons set worked just as well in the construction trade.
B000IZ9QI4|5|was a great fit.
B00BY221YQ|5|I have a tiny studio and this works perfectly. I store it under my craft table and pull it out to reach supplies stored on upper shelves that are hard to reach. It also doubles as a ottoman when I am knitting and watching TV. Sturdy, easy to fold and my 6'3 husband sits on it when he stops for a chat!
B00068XCQU|5|This is a must for anyone who has a vehicle to store for the winter. This is the second one I've bought as I now have two cars to store over the winter. Best price I've ever seen was from Amazon and it had free shipping. You wouldn't be dissapointed with this purchase
B005TOLSBC|1|It is smaller than original case and it has no place to hold the battery in place. So its useless.
B000KBE9Y2|4|This is a good mat, but I wish it had flaps that go over the door frame. I did notice some dirt can be trapped between the edge of the mat and the lower end of the door frame. I also heard the logo on the mat can eventually be dislodged. I personally saw those logos in various parking lots. I guess people just didn't bother to try and attach them back to the mat.
B00415CKEE|5|The handle was delivered in just a few days.  It fit fine and when I installed the handle it was easy and worked.
B006Z59ABY|4|I bought these for my dad, the may who has every.... well almost every ... tool. He likes them a lot.  He normally uses pliers with a rubber gripper, so that would have been an improvement, but I am not sure if that could have been done with the additional tools. He likes these though and they have held up to his rough use.
B004IUKTKY|1|Battery died after 70 miles. Tested at O'Reilly:<br /><br />Measured: 138 cca<br />Rated: 190 cca<br />Temperature: 79F<br />Voltage: 12.80v<br /><br />Risk - Maximum<br /><br />\\"Your battery is approximately 36 months old...\\"<br /><br />Received a refund.
B0052SF0LO|5|This has worked for close to 2 years now, and is still functioning. I am very satisfied,<br />and am ordering another today to use in a different area
B005JREAGY|5|Great value, much cheaper than replacing one tire. Easy to install and operate! I wish that i had purchased this unit sooner.
B003O6XDE2|1|Was posted to fit a fxstdi, but didn't
B001UU5ZEK|5|These cover look fantastic. Great price and well worth the cost. The inside of the car looks more classy with these showing. Can't beat the price. If you have a Caddy, then these should be in it.
B004QPK92E|2|I bought the belt since it was not overly armored.  Stiching came apart with first use.  I would not recommend unless you plan an reinforcing seams
B000WNW6CA|5|Nice item, arrived in perfect condition Thank you.
B000C455MC|3|Works as intended. Part came with the screw holes needing to be chased / re-tapped. The plastic locking tabs on the unit were also broken off, so when you connect the wiring it is not locked. Hopefully it doesn't work it's way loose down the road.
B000B8Y016|5|I bought this Hopkins 19520 Super Deluxe 22&#34; Snowbrush,<br />Arrived in time withs securely packed(awesome) very good quality, strong.<br />I park car in open parking mostly (Utah state with full snow) and use snow brush very often, and this best solution.<br />I highly recommend this product, i got the best for what i paid.
B0068ODC1Q|5|Works great! Easy to set up! Good quality and much less money than purchasing at a dealership. We have bought two devices and we are completely satisfied!
B00CH6T18C|5|Excellent product! This is my third order, and I plan to continue ordering. I have all leather furniture, further my car has leather interior and it's never looked and felt so great. I highly recommend Boo Yah.
B001P29O5Y|4|I am a little weary of the velcor straps that hold the bike down. I am also not happy with how difficult it is to get the actual bike on the rack do to the tight fit. It is easy getting your bike on the first holder, but after that much harder. Depends on the bike, I am sure!
B004TTFTX6|5|Isolator is made of thick rubber. Fits perfect on the lower strut seat for my 08 Trailblazer SS.
B000FEHEDM|4|it was a gift...but the person it was bought for loves it...so, all's good
B000NSJBDG|5|Great shocks, these are the Bilstein HD 4600 series shocks under the AC Delco part #. They are OEM on the Z71's and are a great riding shock. Nice firm ride with good damping. The originals lasted 10 years and the main problem was the bushings became soft which is normal with rubber bushings anyhow. The new shocks made a big difference in ride.
B004A2WPBG|5|It works great as most expensive brake pads and its less expensive.
B000M5Y720|5|Great product. Thank you
B007055FLW|5|Fit like it should, had to adjust motor height in order to get to slip through the long stud bolt on engine mount bracket... Car runs smooth again! Thanks!
B001AGT39M|5|This fit perfectly.  I looked at it, saw 5 bolts and thought I'd be done in no time.  10 hours later I was wrapping up. Learned the job would go a lot smoother by removing the exhaust at the block.  It was three bolts on either side of the block, the hangar bolt, and then the two spring bolts in the rear which broke due to rust so for $11 just get them ahead of time just in case.  Makes removing the old cat from the exhaust header so much easier not to mention reattaching the new one back on to the header.  If you do it this way you'll want to get two new exhaust header gaskets in addition to the front gasket and the rear donut gasket for the new cat.  Oh and since the heat shields are built in to this new cat there is no need to try and remove any of the old shields.  Plus at $265 it was the best deal anywhere.
B000WJ930C|4|The green looks great, almost a perfect match to my Kawasaki Ninja green bike. I had a little trouble putting in on, I have a few wrinkled spots but it still looks good. Don't know how long they will last but I am happy so far.
B005Q4QTAK|1|Didnt even fit inside the housing on and RSX type s. Try being more specific with your production description and/or test your products.
B00BF1GR8M|3|took a few days longer than expected to receive it, for whatever reason I thought I was receiving more than one, but that's my own fault for not reading the description more slowly and clearly, I feel $7 is a lot to pay for a little sticker, I'm hoping a portion of the sale is going towards some sort of Law enforcement memorial fund or something...
B00KLJ7DD2|5|Looks great on my Chevy.
B000NMDFNY|5|This product gets the job done fast.  Recommend to my friends all the time.
