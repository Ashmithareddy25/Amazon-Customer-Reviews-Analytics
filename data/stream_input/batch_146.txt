B002U4N5FQ|5|It worked great the fit was exact thank you
B000I04Z7Q|4|I like the music setting but I hardly use it because it only works properly when the volume is down low. If I want to rock out the lights just flicker rapidly with no variation.
B00V82N1SW|5|nice.
B00651C2E0|5|went right in place. Works well - no change in reception - still very good. Looks funny all limp from road wind when driving, but a great conversation piece.
B00RW7W7G4|5|Good product, rain doesn't stand a chance!  :)  Would recommend, can't go wrong even if price was higher.
B00Q3E79TW|5|very easy to install - noticeable improvement
B00SEN6TJ6|2|Pulled loose from the netting.
B000C9F8RO|5|Seems to be great quality, just couldn't get the old one off but if it starts to fail I will take it to a shop to get it replaced .
B00E9HWRK6|5|love it notched around front and sides. FITS GREAT.
B0002JN2EU|5|Used this as a fuel and oil treatment for many years on many cars. Excellent product. All my engines run smoothly, no knock and so I'll keep using it. I treat 3-4 times a year.
B004RCRS9I|5|Works good soft bristles remove light to medium dirt. Soft bristles won't scratch the paint.
B003ULRESC|3|works but was a bit picky on how the key was put in it before it would turn
B00DBF0DO4|5|Got it installed in 5 mins and it looks great... can't tell if it's actually working due to my car having electrical steering and adjusting stiffness to mode stance. But still looks awesome. Got here fast to. Was packaged really well and was common sense install.
B001NZQIDE|5|Did job
B00JXZR6CI|5|Amazing product.  Bought this product over 10 years ago and haven't been able to find it again until now.  Works very well and easy to use.  Best shine for old cars.  Removes oxidization and gives a brilliant shine with little effort. Great price and prompt shipping.
B000C7QHJE|3|Should of bought the next one up 50 bucks more
B00063X38M|5|Great product for deferent purpose but your fault , I assumed to be the one I need 👍🏻
B00J0JHY8I|4|I replaced the banjo bolt on my RG500 with this pressure switch banjo bolt, as the old &#34;pull type&#34; brake light switch could no longer be used.  This seems to work great!  Hope it lasts.
B00H3ZYI0I|3|Great color but not bright enough.
B00B1UYSEW|5|looked great very easy to install
B0021ERKMY|5|Great quality and good price.
B001RBCU90|5|looks great
B007ICVC5U|5|Nice part, good quality, reasonable price.  Used to hang Late model Mustang GT mufflers under a  DOHC powered not rod.
B002HCA8B0|4|If you want a very high performance muffler for little $ this is the one you fits easy ( I changed all my exhaust to to 21/2<br />Pipe &headers turn down on muffler) nice rumble but when you open him up you can hear that the power is coming out . Well made give it shot
B000E7YP82|5|This bag worked great!  I loaded it up, stressed out the zippers and the buckles and not one tear.  I bought 2 straps for extra protection in case the buckles gave out but they held out great.  (Chicago to Houston)  I also bought the mat to go under it, between the straps and that it never moved.
B0066RXS64|5|These Chrome Tips are great looking and great  quality, gives my 06 E350 a whole new look, easy to install, can't beat the price I love them, thx!
B00FRMBIRU|3|The condenser comes with a filter/drier permanently attached but its not clearly stated in the description nor on the denso website at least not at the time of writing this review which is the main reason for the three star review.  It was fairly easy to install and I will update this review (maybe) if it holds up.  Update:  The condenser has held up fine so far but as of August 2016 i sold the car.
B000MSDMJQ|4|this is what I remember - that came on muscle cars.it is 3/8''x 16 thread size for my hurst shifter.make sure you check your size.
B000C9FE3C|5|Excellent AC Delco replacement part for way less than the dealer.  You will need this if replacing the compressor.
B00S00AE12|5|Works great
B00IZR6ETQ|1|Worked fine at first, smoothed the idle till I couldn't tell if the car was on, felt the performance increase as well.<br /><br />After about 1000 miles had one failure and on the verge of another. I should have listened to the other bad review. Not worth it. Got the ngx iridium and runs fine now. These lasted me about 2 weeks and a drive from north Carolina to Florida. Packaging was terrible. I can only hope it didn't damage any coils and such.
B00390RYXY|5|Bigger than I thought-but it's Led Zeppelin
B00MN963JS|4|Husband is an iron worker and face warders are a must in the cold weather.  He loves the style of this one. It's good for moderate cold but not some of the near zero temps he has worked in. He does recommend it, however and has me searching for other patterns in this same product.
B00FMPSJX8|5|This fits perfectly on the handlebars of my dirt bike.  It doesn't interfere with turning or filling the tank with gas.  The size is big enough to hold keys, wallet, registration and cell phone.
B001DRLPY4|5|Quality filter. Just as good as Toyota OEM filters and better than many other brand filters. Fitment is nice & snug. I will continue to use these exclusively. Highly recommend, especially at the price.
B008G3K9IQ|5|Great fit and finish!
B00VVBZDWC|4|👍👍👌👌
B0022ZL5DW|5|Received what was promised, shipped promptly.
B00OPJFTOE|5|looks nice
B00CEFDWMC|3|I got one from gohastings, it was a 5 star, i got a second from some one else and it claimed new, it was new, but the product itself looked like it had melted inside the packaging
B00KQXKG46|1|It's only been installed on my truck a few months, and it fell off my Bull Bar due to the brackets breaking. It's a good light bar. Love it. Just mad that it fell off my truck while driving. Once I get contacted and the situation fixed, I'll rate more stars.
B0009V4GVY|4|I've never owned a car bra before, so I didn't know what to expect. I bought it to protect my Honda Element that will be towed behind my motorhome.  I was pleased that it fastened and all the clips attached where they were supposed to go.  The only thing is that there are places that are bunched a little and the tabs that go under the headlights show, but they do stay put.  For my purpose it is fine,  If I was expecting a totally smooth appearance I would have been disappointed.  I can see how an Element would be hard to fit.
B000P0ZK1O|5|The directions in the package are not very clear.  But after working with it, it worked as expected.  I recommend it.  So, advice for the next buyer: Place in the cylinder and tighten.  Place the 13/16&#34; closed end over the large nut, place the wrench so that the handle is over the cutting blade portion of the reamer.  Apply pressure with a 3/8&#34; drive ratchet with 3 inch extension and 13mm socket on the tightening bolt  as you turn the wrench.  You have to hold it down or it will wedge as you turn the 13/16&#34; wrench and you will damage your cylinder (produce gouges).  Turn about 10 times around, tighten, repeat.  I recommend only going 1/2 way into the ridge before moving to the next cylinder.  Once done with all cylinders, go back to the beginning and finish each cylinder.  By now, you have the experience to complete without gouging into the cylinder wall.  I only went to the very edge of the ridge in my cylinders as the hone is slightly wedged so that it will start honing at the top of the cylinder and gradually work into the ridge as you tighten top down.  I then used a Flex Hone to remove the cylinder glaze and dress the cylinders.  Other advice, place the engine in an engine stand to keep stable and turn the engine so that it is at a 45 degree angle to the horizon, on the second time through, work  each cylinder from the opposite side of the stand so you do not always stop the wrench turn at the same location each time.
B007EXMYIC|1|Stopped working in just a few weeks. Not water proof.
B0024ECCJW|5|works great all intructions are easy to fallow
B000BWCCG2|4|I ordered the wrong size for my 06 gto.i could have returned it, but maybe I&#34;ll use in my next car.it is a very nice shifter!
B00DLMOTSI|5|I ordered the 880 bulb 10k hid kit for my fog lights on my srt and I got it In two days installed them it was super easy to do and they work perfect and look great I also have the xentec 10k hid in for my low beams it looks great!
B005N76NRO|1|Run very small.
B008BLKI2U|1|It was completely transparent and had cuts and bends everywhere
B00BFDFQE6|3|Not as good as I expected
B010RBSXNM|5|After dealing with cracked shock towers on my last E36 M3  (boy was that an expensive fix), I wouldn't own another E36 with out these. Finish and fit was excellent. There are much pricier alternatives out there, but these fit the bill perfectly.
B005JDSSIY|5|It looks nice on my Orange Cooper. I have black wheels so it stands out pretty good. I can spot it standing about 10ft away. Not sure how it looks when I drive though.
B001DH6EH2|4|Fits my '99 Ford Explorer 5.0 V8 perfectly, and seems to function normally.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The aluminum grill of the radiator is about half the thickness and half the weight of the original. (Cost cutting?)  I have my doubts how well it will work under extreme conditions.<br /><br />So far so good...
B00MLI6OHC|5|Great product and great seller, product cam as described and for a great price, came before estimated date of arrival wich was awesome! Light is great quality and very bright, wiring is fairly easy to wire, instructions were pretty easy to wire and looks great all installed! Will definitely recommend!
B005UJC1E4|5|I received my control unit yesterday and installed it into my E93 convertible. The installation was a bit challenging because there is not a lot of room to work behind the back panel. Most of the installation time was spent trying to align the connector with the original roof control module. After the installation, I turned on the ignition and had some error appear on the car's dashboard. After disconnecting and reconnecting some of the cable connections, I was able to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Once the installation was completed, I tested all of the functions and am very happy with this purchase. I'll check back in a few months if there are any issues as a result of installing this control unit.
B001F0IJPC|5|GREAT PRICE. GREAT FIT.
B005NLQAHS|5|It Works flawlessly with Torque Pro and my Chevy Monte Carlo
B00GONFTTE|5|Big bang for the buck! I will order more.
B00JAR6LXY|5|Freakin incredible design. You'll need an 8mm deep socket wrench to get the job done.
B00NJ5425C|5|Excellent. Watched a video on how to do it yourself. And saved me 125.00 because this part it's not on sale you would need to you the whole thing on any auto part store. Thanks
B00AZOHPOK|4|perfect fit, little too fragile. Not same material as oem parts.
B00CMGXY9O|5|Looks great on my Yukon - can be seen from a distance.  My prior hitch cover had small spring like structure to keep it in place.  I had to use a wire tie on this.
B00CWG1Q80|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B00M3NEBMK|5|Product fit perfect no more sunburn
B0017JSD34|5|Wonderful selection of nozzles
B00KPZECVI|1|This key never worked.
B00KAAWVIY|5|Cannot be more satisfied!
B006JBI2AY|5|I'm using them all the time. They stay fairly put where you want them and I couldn't be more happy with them
B0073J970U|4|it fit good !
B000PUTZQ0|4|The toe us very high and I had to readjust my shift lever to be able to get the toe of the boot under it. Otherwise I like them, and sure they will be much better in a year or so. Once they are broke in.
B00KJGCEXG|5|Excellent experience!
B00UD3Z3EW|5|This might be my favorite mitt now. This mitt holds soap well and scrubs without leaving marks on my car.I use 2 mitts to wash, one for the top and this one for the bottom of the car. This mitt busts through the hard dirt and road grime found on the bottom panels of cars.
B00EK6NS22|4|I like these a lot.  I just wish they were steady instead of blinking, lol
B0080DIAHE|3|I was disappointed that it did not filter out smelly diesel exhaust.
B005CHT4W6|5|Love this oil! It is the only stuff I put in my 2012 Mazdaspeed 3. I highly recommend it.
B005334JYW|3|i find it sad. it does not come with any adaptor kit like all the others on the market. now im stuck waiting longer and pay more to get a adaptor. shifter is nice, good quality
B011YIUL78|5|I bought these for my kids who are always complaining that that the sun is in their eyes when we are driving. The shades are dark and keep the sun out. They fit well for the windows in my mini van. Each shade attaches with 2 suction cups to hold it in place. The suction cups work well and I have not noticed them slipping out of place. There is a small bag to hold each shade. I finally figured out that the shades fold like a figure 8 and then squish so they fit in the bag. Overall, a nice darkening shade for cars that do not have significant tinting. I received this with a promotional discount from the seller in exchange for an honest review
B00VQ0OTT6|5|Thank you it work very good. And thanks for the sale too that save me a lot of money.
B00009PGNR|5|I am a truck driver and I am very happy with this cooler. I ended up using a bungy cord across the top just to keep closed tight.
B000E7WLJW|5|Awesome bag. Used it and accidentally sprayed it with gasoline. Contents were not touched by gas. Rinsed with water and has no gasoline smell. Drove through rain, no leaks. The downs hold tight. Easy to apply and sinch down. Never loosened.
B00EUUNRKQ|5|Very coll
B00GBVHPV4|5|Great product
B000C561BK|1|Parts does not fit element sc
B0051BW1J6|2|First of all it fit the way it should. It arrived damaged it, no big deal, one of the side brackets was bent. I was able to straighten it. Once I finally got it installed in the motor running, it had a small pinhole in it. But I needed it for that weekend and chose to fix it and keep it.
B009FLNHE6|5|Very good...
B00DH2YKO0|5|Easy to apply - looks good
B003BHIAU6|1|Will not lock.  The only Stant product I have ever had that failed to work properly
B005VUTL18|5|exact fit, easy exchange
B003HC3WX0|5|fits and look good
B00EEG8NHI|5|product came in excellent condition can't  wait to installed them on!!!
B00GT0MIU0|5|These lights are awesome, they are so bright.  Look great at night and would totally recommend them to anyone wanting to upgrade or customize their ride.
B00P2MN8VO|1|Great bag. Attaches to bar well and holds all my spare clothes and shoes for emergencies.<br /><br />Amended:<br />Bag did not last long, zipper broke. Not well held together near upper zipper location. One bag hanging on, other completely fell a part from that location.
B00LXAFRY0|5|Great oil, great price, free and quick shipping!
B00U9ZIF94|5|Well packaged and was what I was expecting.
B00TEG37Y2|5|Perfect size for that discrete sticker in my car as a tribute. Also have one on my helmet.
B00IOT6C2E|3|HOLE ALIGNMENT PROBLEMS!!!!  This hitch is a very solid hitch BUT I had alignment problems with the right rear side hole being about 0.050&#34; too low. I had the hitch pressed tight with a jack and it still did not line up (and yes the bottom of the car body and top of hitch were both free of any obstructions). I had to let the Left side hang down in order to allow the right side to slightly raise up enough to start both bolts. Also have a friend help you install it. It's a simple install but you need to wiggle it up inside of all the plastic fascia. I used two jacks to slowly work it up into position. Also watch out for over spray of the undercoating. The front edge of right side overlapped on to some thick under coating. Had to torque it three times to allow the under coating to compress. Wait about ten minutes between torques. But in the end it did install and is a Very solid, well designed hitch.
B0056GUSNM|2|didnt work...
B003AL23TC|5|Worked as advertised.  Tried the EMS last weekend and I was very happy.  I just wish there was a better way to secure the product besides the flimsy ring attached.  I am a little worried that not securing this product that it might walk away.
B000WJIEP2|5|great for cleaning life long filters.
B004V5YR68|5|Easy to put on, works well, comfortable. I found I liked plastic rather than metal clip. It went into track easier when putting helmet on.
B001TYJOG2|2|Installing these seat covers takes about 2 days and it didn't quite fit my Toyota Corolla right, I had to improvise A LOT. The head rest covers are much darker than the picture makes them look and they have corners that stick out weird up towards the top and the ties on the bottom didn't help with anything. When I finally got the covers installed I was happy enough with how they looked to keep them, however the material is not nearly as nice as the picture makes it out to be. I've had them in for less than six months and black areas look worn down and EVERYTHING sticks to the black part. I have to vacuum every other month and I am always pulling hair and lint off of the material. If I want to take them off I will literally have to cut them off since the ties are way down deep under the seat, so I will keep them on until they wear down enough to the point where I can't stand to look at them.  Not very happy with them, but still they will protect your actual car seats so I guess it could be worth it for that.
B00HN4BTYC|5|Working well easy install takes about 5 mins. On my Protege 5.
B00O5MVOYA|5|Great weekend DIY Project. We used them on our Aluminium hood on E60 BMW M5. Fit right after about an hour or two of tweaking.
B00IFTAYJA|5|Quality product
B002045XPG|5|exactly as advertsed....qualty merchandise.
B000CFLPNY|5|These pins are beefy - larger than I expected (my fault only - you might consider being more careful than me). But there are some smaller ones that meet my needs great. And the quality of the pins and the case is great.
B000VSICA6|3|I've had these shoes for about  3 years and like the comfort and protection they offer, but am disappointed with the durability of them.  This year the leather actually tore on both shoes.  On the left shoe it tore at the gear shift pad (1&#34; length).  On the right shoe it tore on the top, outside seam (3&#34; length).  This happened before I even began riding this year and I do very minimal riding (maybe 500 - 1000 miles per year). I can't really recommend these to others based on the lack of quality/durability. They only seemed to be ok for a season or 2 with fairly light riding.
B006C86G4S|5|Good product
B00H1O2XTE|5|Does the job for my 03 DRZ/KLX 400
B001CO4WA2|5|Installed this coil with a  123 Ignition RV/6  distributor for 6 cylinder Benz, works great. Engine runs smooth, no miss, and pulls like a bull!<br />Primary internal resistance measured @ 3.6 ohms. Also utilized .4 ohms (blue) external resistor for total of 4.0ohms. This higher resistance will supposedly save the circuit board inside the 123 distributor from overheating in the event ignition is left ON for extended period if time. No sound of liquid sloshing around when shaken..... not stirred!<br />So far, happy with result, and product.
B000BQYH6Q|5|Great product.  Has many uses in a home garage.
B00HPYQ3IW|5|so cute!
B004IV8NBU|5|bought this as a joke for buddies car. I put it on without him knowing and he didn't know what was making the loud noise behind him. I finally had to break down and tell him before he brought his car to the shop. We have since put it on many things playing around. it works as of making a funny noise but i wouldnt call in a turbo sound make by any means. In other words you will not sound like a turbo diesel truck nor car. but enjoy it for what it is.
B0079SISDW|5|Purchased for a 2008 R32... exact color i wanted - WHITE and bright!!! Note: Emit a slightly greenish-yellow hue for the first month during burn in, but maybe i was just used to the cheap D2S bulbs i was using before.
B000UKL4SM|4|Great parts kit.
B008427D88|5|Like
B00II5YADC|5|Works GREAT,  It is a little difficult on these new Hyundais with such aggressive body lines.  However, it does get almost all the water off.  Took me from three towels down to just the one for touch ups.  Great product.  This is coming from a guy who is very picky about auto detailing.  I will say, if the paint on your car isn't smooth and waxed I'm not certain you'd see such great results.
B006R1UGGY|4|not sure if it worked or not still having problem went into the car easilily
B00BGTL9GI|1|First time I used it, it burnt up, do not buy this product very cheap! They refused to replace it.
B00TRCWA6Y|5|They were perfect<br />Same ones that you get in hardware store 100 for 10.00<br />Store 2 for almost $3.00
B00P2D3VZG|5|Very nice LED bulb.  I installed numerous LED bulbs in my vehicle and love them.  I will warn you, they emit very white bright light.  If bright white light is not appealing to you, stick with your stock bulbs.
B0009T6EA2|5|Satisfied!
B0091U4MR2|5|Worked perfectly for adding Sirius radio to my 2013 Mazda 3 that didn't come with it from the factory.  You need to also order the cable kit (item #  0000-81-L22 Satellite Radio Receiver Kit)  which was not a surprise to me because I had read and researched this product before ordering.
B00CSX42WY|1|The white turned yellow in the sun.  Unfortunately, they're on the car so I can't return them without being &#34;emblem-less&#34; and the car looking even worse.  Don't buy.
B000C7Y6AG|5|All 4 speeds now work! Great product and service!
B005VYP118|5|looks great.
B00RA41UD0|5|Work great and look great
B00U4FPTSE|3|It is hard to open and is starting to rust
B001KSA28Q|4|they fit and work great
B0000UUX7A|5|Fit and look great and do the job!
B0052SF0LO|5|perfect as expected
B006QNN46W|1|Terrible. Half the thickness of the other manufacturers.
B002P8SN0Y|5|Fast great fit.
B001EBDMCC|4|I really love the look of the Lindby bars. I have one on my Vstar 650 and now one on my Vstar 1300. Definitely a more noticeable impression on the 650. The 1300 frame is so big, that these don't stand out as much as the full bars. However, great foot placement so you can stretch out on the highway. And will still keep the bike off my leg if I ever lay down. One complaint would be more with Yamaha, and how much locktite they used to cement in the engine mount bolts. Not something I can put on Lindby. I think with these, I just wish these were slightly larger to match the bigger frame of the 1300. For the 650, they are fantastic. But, they still give a great look and always nice to have the extra protection.
B00HVI0OG4|4|Im satisfied
B007KPTS88|5|These bearings are just as expected.  Have to install them today. Thanks
B000CPI5XW|5|Great oil helped clunk shifts good 2014 street glide cant wait to try primary oil it is amust

B004SZC7NG|5|Great product. Highly recommend!!!!
B00SISKBA0|1|Awful no other way to describe this purchase ..total rip off
B00V6XSMVE|5|The only thing I didn't like was trying to find somthin to open up the heavy duty staples they used to staple it all together...other than that, the products are great.  Nice color, not cheap looking or feeling at all.
B010APEJ60|4|It looks even better in person. And shipping was fast.
B00S4HQQKY|5|Love love love it. It's a nice sticker and is on my jeep!!! Went on nicely and looks great!
B007JLYGTO|4|Just installed batteries and they are charging.  Original batteries were wired.  Had to cut wires and wire pigtails.  So far, so good.  Will test battery operation when fully charged.
B003YI421I|5|Good glue
B00AYXM4DY|5|Very good.
B00GTOJK0C|5|Satisfied
B00Q0TIGSS|4|Easy install,work well.The only thing I would add is check the polarity of the 4.5 in lights plug,mine were reversed which doesn't matter on regular bulb but does on LED.
B002WRRNFO|5|Very nice.  Seems solid in construction.  Works well, and I feel better knowing I have my valuables in this vs a glove box, or rolling around in the trunk.
B0085OJXB0|5|Better than I expected! Very durable. Love it
B001KSCF0E|2|Magnification on mirror is either different or wrong. Cheap so I can't complain but you get for how much you pay for it.<br />Easy to install that's why I gave it 2 star.
B002OIB9GU|3|returned as it did not fit my truck
B007Y86RRG|5|awesome starter love it.....it is what i wanted......the thing is this starter cost 150.00 reman at a local auto store....this starter is made out of new parts less chance for messing up....has a warranty and i paid less than sixty dollars shipped to my home......love it .....awesome .....recommend to everyone who needs a great starter........will buy this again if needed.....
B00FBOW814|1|Remote is without battery.  Please sent me complimentary a new remote with battery in working condition.  Thanks
B001SIDFXM|1|NOT memory foam, it's just regular foam!
B007AOQW24|5|These are expensive, but they do fit perfectly.  They are very thick and heavy duty, and my guess is that they will perform well and contain spills/water.
B000VKTUD2|5|Very good.
B0065UKKCW|5|Fit my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8 perfectly. It took less than 30 seconds to install. No electronics to manage. Solved my P0171 error code.
B000NJ4D7E|5|Worked great.
B005FWWUNS|1|Mine came in a white box&bubble wrap&No battery,,,,,Flea market style.....

B00MCZYWTG|5|Great product  Gast shipping .
B00KXHFYPG|4|As described...  Would order again!
B000COXL2I|5|After having the old style covers and the hub cap style these by far are the best thing on the market , attachment is easy , strong, and secure . Fit and finish is awesome . Going to buy a set for my trailer.
B00E5PK8TE|5|I first shopped around for a Harley Battery and I refused to pay $200 for a motorcycle battery.  This battery was half the cost and works just as good as a factory battery.  The product arrived sooner than expected.
B00OZNA2YM|5|Very bright worked for all applications not ck
B00HS9FU6U|5|Great quality decal for the back of my truck. Bought a second from same supplier because of great quality and service.
B0091OG8XE|4|exactly as pictured.  Found similar ones a few days later at the Dollar store, so at $40 they were a bit pricy
B005RNGL9O|5|Excellent product
B006X8BR8C|4|It was just as expected.
B008RHJTS2|5|Awesome , I love it , it is what I needed 👍🏻
B007USCM7E|5|There's a reason this item is a best seller for its purpose: IT WORKS!
B0058SPQMQ|5|Bought for my husband.  He has a shop, and I had previously purchased one for him about a year or so for him.  He liked it so much, he want d another.  Great product.
B005DLLVWC|5|I open the package and  installed it and it worked great just what I needed .
B00Q3JTSRI|5|I bought the small size (13.5&#34; - 14.5&#34;) for my 2015 Nissan Rogue and it was a perfect fit. I first measured my steering wheel and it was 14.5&#34; diameter. So I ordered this one. As soon as it arrived, I tried to put it on the wheel and it first seem to be very difficult. I thought I should have bought the next size. I tried it one more time the next day and within a minute I was able to put it on. Perfect fit. I think it all depends on how you install it. Probably two sets of hands would make it easier to install. The product claims to be genuine leather but I doubt it. But it did not have any ordor which is good.
B00DD102EC|4|these are great for the price.
B00I8INWPQ|4|2006 MX-5 Miata. Fit perfectly. No issues with fitment at all (dropped right in). Pleating is not quite a full (rounded) as OEM Denso filter. 1 more pleat than OEM however. Material does not seem to be as &#34;fluffy&#34; but this is a subjective observation. I dont know if this will actually impact airflow or filtration. Considering the extremely low price as an add on item, if it works well, it will be an absolute steal at the current pricing.
B0068ODC1Q|5|Works great and very easy to program.
B001AIZ5HY|2|I did as per the instructions and I found out no difference, Didn't work for me. Sorry
B00G1JYZ96|5|fast delivery  very good bell for my Moto
B009ZGAF0A|5|Better than paying a small fortune at the dealership.
B001SF5GVO|4|nice
B004I0IB9U|5|great price
B00KWG120O|5|Works great on a 2015 R1200RT with the no key gas cap.
B00S19IABS|3|They work. But the springs to install them are not included. Had to spend 10 dollars at the dealership for them.....
B000C7S0BC|5|perfect condition delivered quick and matched and bolted up perfect.
B001FANQLE|1|It broke in less than a week.
B006IWM0NE|4|Very satisfied with these spacers.<br />They feel solid, and they went on without a problem.<br />One problem, and the reason they do not get 5 stars: the instructions were absolutely horrible. The instructions came on 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; paper, and looked liked black & white copies of copies of copies. The photos were completely useless, as they were so grainy, they didn't look like anything at all.<br />The instructions were also pretty confusing. Fat Bob's Garage included instructions for Jeep Cherokees, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers all on the same pages, and some things just didn't make sense. The same set of instructions were also used for the 2&#34; and 3&#34; spacers, but had different guidance at some points, without explanation of WHY the directions could be different -- very frustrating!<br />I still recommend these, you won't be sorry.
B00L26OLYM|4|Works great. Fit exactly where I wanted it. The rocker is slightly larger than the rest of the switch so I had to widen the cutout a little with a dremmel and the terminals are fairly close for not being insulated. These the things kept me from giving it 4 stars but is otherwise a great switch. Looks nice next to factory switches.
B00I2JIUXA|5|You spend a lot of time in your car, and you want the quality of the air you and your passengers breathe in the cabin to be top quality.  Your car dealer may charge $50-$100 or even more to change your cabin air filter, but actually it's really easy and quick to do by yourself - and you can pick one up normally for around $10-$15.<br /><br />I change my air filter in my Santa Fe Sport about once a year.  In that time a lot of dust, dirt and pollen - all the things you don't want inside your cabin - have accumulated on the filter.  The new filter always looks amazingly white and shiny alongside the outgoing one.  You will not believe the difference.<br /><br />To swap the filter (in my Santa Fe at least) you don't need any tools.  Just unscrew two fasteners in the glove box, remove a supporting clip and the glove box will drop, allowing access to the air filter.  Take off the cover and you'll be able to slide out the old filter.  Be careful not to let the dust and dirt fall out into the glove box or on to the floor as you remove the old filter.  Slide the new one in, put back the cover, the supporting clip and screw back the two fasteners and you are done.  This really is a 5 minute job, and even less if you are doing it for the second or third time.<br /><br />You will notice the difference when you turn on the air after changing the filter - it smells much fresher.<br /><br />Save yourself the money and have the satisfaction of doing the job yourself.  Breathe easy again!
B00IO8JCUE|4|Excellent quality BUT does not fit manual tail gate, for automatic gate only so I had to return it.
B00YJCFWJ4|4|Waited a while to receive these awesome spiders but it was well worth the wait. They are perfect for what I bought them for. I did have to contact the seller and they were so great and responded quickly. Wonderful customer service.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Bought this to protect the interior of my newly purchased Lexus IS350 F-Sport.  Just finished applying this and the reviews are true, low gloss and very easy to use.  The interior looks better than when I picked up the vehicle from the dealer after they &#34;detailed&#34; the car.  Buy 303 and you won't be disappointed!
B00MK6I9LY|4|Good product for the money.
B00W8LR9KS|4|Pro#1: They fit my windows well. Con#1: The adhesive sticks fairly okay but not 100% (And I used the correct procedure). Pro#2: After one flew off mid-drive on the interstate, they sent me all 4 pieces as replacements incase the rest came off. Con#2: Instructions are not provided. You have to look them up.<br />When it comes down to the wire, I like the product. At an autozone or advance autoparts you will probably pay $80 for these. This is a pretty good deal.
B00Y8FP4ZY|5|Haven't put this brand of the A9 cam, it started with a 50cc, rebuilt it to the &#34;80cc'  (47mm) bbk, I now know that its a 72cc then, after I rebuilt it, learned a few tricks here and there, it started running like crap after a year and half on it, now i'm going all the way this time, same set up just everything from seals to the gaskets. I noticed wear and tear on some parts, replaced with performance, now it's a animal, love this cam, can't get a quality product as this &#34;true&#34; A9 cam for this price!! Thank you team keep up the awesome job!!
B00SQG8JL2|5|Freedom
B002PMM9N2|1|It`s duration is bad
B004RPJWHQ|5|tiny but very cute
B00B3ZIYW2|3|Size and material grade A+ fit and appearance of quality c-.  These axle backs require expert install and cutting  welding are a must which makes buying a more expense system that fits well a much better and time saving bargain over this system!  However, the power and bad to the bone sound is additive just not so pretty to look at.
B003YJJHI0|5|It's been around a year and this regulator is holding up good.  My last one of a different brand corroded inside and failed after around a year so this one seems to be of better quality.
B00L4TF32G|5|Works great!
B00N7KNI1S|3|Good quality and great price
B006N91C2M|5|This battery is an identical replacement and works perfectly.
B009LAUY1A|5|Come fast
B001OMRF7Y|3|Is this the whole top or just the back window portion? Was tricked before.
B00B1DLD9W|5|fit perfect and they look good
B00UC2V0VE|5|Cover fit fine, works for me
B00A8FCI0W|5|Do know it comes with a clear shield, not dark smoke as shown in the picture. At the moment that dark shield is no less than $35 shipped anywhere on the net. That shield (and the entire helmet for that matter) also appears to be getting rarer and more expensive by the day. This helmet doesn't have bluetooth either. The seller is showing the wrong photo. The bluetooth model will cost you considerably more money.<br /><br />Those things aside, I think this might be the least expensive helmet I have purchased in 25 years and it is without a doubt the nicest looking one. The graphics are stunning and cool. You must see it to appreciate it. Everybody comments on it and thinks it is awesome. I don't do dark tinted shields anyway, so the clear one that came with it is just another bonus to me. If you too tend to get caught out on your bike after dark you shouldn't use a dark shield on your helmet either. It fits true to size. It is plenty comfortable, and the vents work well. The DOT rating is great with me, especially at this price point.<br /><br />Seriously, for the price I paid for this helmet there is absolutely nothing to complain about. I say they might be discontinued and getting rare, so don't wait. Those who still have them for sale seem to be limited in available sizes. I had to settle for one a size smaller than I would have normally ordered. I had to break it in on a shelf for a week with a soccer ball crammed inside it. I learned this trick over the years and I am happy to report that it once again worked great.
B000GZNCMC|5|Tool works as advertised.  Price was nice too.
B000AMBNPY|4|These are great for the front windows. Fit well. Gives a little more added protection against the sun but let's you still see right through. I'm going to buy a second set for my other car. I like them THAT much.<br /><br />When you buy these, look for the suction cups that have a wire ring on the opposite side of the cup (like these).  I've bought a few different sets of these types of screens and the ones with the wire rings are the best buy. They seem to last longer, are easier to put on / off, and you don't lose that suction cup.
B000O8XNAW|5|Great jacket and good quality
B008CPUGMW|5|Worked perfect in my 2009 Ranger.
B000K1PKFY|5|Tool is as expected.  Works well.
B000EVWDU0|5|Works great
B004ZF39T0|2|This is a good kit but I accidentally ordered the 35 watt instead of the 55 watt which is much brighter and was the same price. I'm not sure why they even make the 35watt version. Get the 55watt
B000C55YUE|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B009R1DQF4|5|Worked great for 2009 Toyota RAV4 plastic panel under engine area.
B00COYNZJ8|5|This was a gift for my guy and he loved it.
B000C2OFV6|5|Direct fit for my 97 Mercury Mountaineer.  Compressor  had oil and gaskets present.  Operated as it should once refrigerant was added.
B00BSATEOE|4|...so I don't die.
B00CIA2IG4|1|I purchased this sticker a while back because it is titled as a genuine sticker but it is not, the space in the R is smaller than genuine. Not much of a difference but it should not be titled as genuine.
B00FU9B8B6|5|Much better than the stock paper filter. Really good product!
B00ZGUETQK|4|no 3 m tape ill get it
B008S2ULEW|5|Just what I ordered and received on time; Super Experience and Great Product!!!<br /><br />JC from AZ
B0035U3IBU|5|After an error in shipping,  Amazon came through! The first set never arrived and I  was in a bind. However,customer service was fast and nice and got me a different set ASAP!  As for the brakes,  they are great. Work perfect with no noise and minimal dust. Great stopping power as well.
B009UPLBLI|4|Didn't need it after all but will keep it as I'm sure we will need to replace ours sooner or later.
B0009YDQE4|5|My son loved it.
B003SNUGSC|2|poor quality very hard to install it
B0000AZ8MD|4|Good quality but doesn't allow for enough arch when using support bows.
B001B9SL50|4|good
B006TJBFKU|5|My wife saw this saying on a t-shirt but the shirt costed about 3 times as much as this tag holder.She loves this on her car and it makes me fill like I'm doing my job as a husband that she is announcing this.
B00869A60G|5|Loved it ... Really well made and its heavy and loved the box
B0022ZHHMA|5|been using it for years now,.. kx500..
B00CBIP6XK|5|I used it everyday since I got it about a month ago and I am extremely happy about my purchase! I received the package super fast ( ordered early morning on 7/15 and received 7/17 day time)! And if I saw the tracking record correctly, this was shipped from east coast and I received in California! It's a perfect fit for my CB500F and the magnet keeps the bag on my tank even I'm riding at around 60-65mph (I don't take freeway so can't comment if it works good at higher speed). The strap designed to go around handle bar makes double safety from falling off from tank if it's too much for magnets to hold! The only thing i can say is my iPhone 6 won't go with cellphone pocket on top of the bag since the pocket is designed for iPhone 5 or similar size electronic devices. However, this does not drag down my rating about this bag!
B001B7BUAU|5|I put this in my Volvo 240.  It fit fine and does a good job.  After replacing the original, a cheap plastic one, and a junkyard one I'd had enough.  I bought a metal one that worked simply and should last as long as the car will.
B0036GL5F4|5|Direct replacement for a lot less than Harley.
B007TG7HFY|5|Great Product
B00HYL1XA4|5|Excellent product, fast delivery. Nice packaging. A+ experience.

B001G4Z5J0|5|Bigger than I thought it would be but that's a good thing. Very sturdy.
B008CRE4GO|5|Went into my E70 BMW X5 and working as good as OEMs but combined with ceramic pads producing almost no brake dust. A definite upgrade for substantially less than OEM.
B00MV7S73M|4|Not easy to install. No installations provided so be prepared to youtube.
B00WISPVAG|5|Works just like advertised.  Just know that these are not suitable for using to project light on anything.  They are really just for accent, and for that purpose, they're GREAT for the low price.
B00HYI278O|5|The Max liner fit perfectly in my 2015 Accord. Since it was shipped rolled up, it had a slight curl in it. Once installed in car, it flattened out in a few hours. Mat arrived in a few days on standard  shipping.
B00QN1WJRC|5|This light is super bright and looks great on my Mini.
B00B1AKDIC|1|did not fit  hard to install I replaced them with another brand

B00GJ1X00Q|3|It is a good product, i have not used the call feature yet. I really just bought it to listen to music. Only down side is after 50 mph, you cant hear anything.
B00D5FNARW|5|Good product
B00199BWTE|5|This product worked perfectly for solving my emissions related error codes on my 2003 Toyota Corolla LE (manual).  This product is the downstream O2 sensor located under the car (below the passengers side door) below the catalytic converter.  My check engine light appeared so I had the car inspected by 2 mechanics who pulled the error codes with their OBDII scanner.  I had the dreaded P0420 code (cat converter) plus 3 others related to the evap system P0440, P0441 and P0446.  They both said I need a new cat converter and evap canister.  The parts alone are approx. $1,200-$1,400 for the factory catalytic converter and about $385 for the canister plus labor.  So probably around $2,700-$3,000 for parts and labor.  I did a lot of research online, watched youtube videos etc to find that Toyota Corollas notoriously throw these codes for emissions.  Sometimes replacing the gas cap alone will clear all of your codes so do the folling steps in this order if your Toyota is throwing these emission codes.  1. Make sure you have a factory gas cap (very important) always turn gas cap until it clicks, never overfill gas tank or top off the gas tank, it will ruin the evap canister.  Stop pumping gas when the pump automatically stops  2. replace both upstream and downstream O2 sensors, Denso makes the best non factory part at a great price.  The sensors come with a small tube of Anti sieze lubricant which you must use on the threads, do not substitute with brake grease or other lubricant.  Unplug all emissions related parts including both O2 sensor and egr sensor, spray all electrical contacts with electric parts cleaner and reconnect.  I also purchased a 7/8&#34; O2 sensor socket adapter which really helps out, access is tough with a regular wrench and it's cheap to buy.  Usually appears in the Amazon 'customers who bought this also purchased...' message when you buy the O2 sensors.  Once both O2 sensors have been installed, you'll need to reset your error codes and then drive the car for approx. 20 miles to see if they reappear.  You can have AutoZone read ODBII codes and reset OBDII codes for free.  I bought an app for android phone called 'Torque Pro' (4.99) and a bluetooth adapter for my OBDII port ($14.99 on Amazon) to read and clear my own codes.  OBDII scanners are usually $100-$140 from auto retailers.  In conclusion, after worrying about these issues for about 8 months, I installed 2 new O2 sensors and a new factory gas cap, cleared the error codes and passed my emissions test with flying colors saving myself about $2,800.  I highly recommend trying this first before replacing the cat converter and/or evap canister.car for approx. 20 miles to see if they reappear.

B005H7DRQA|2|Slightly removed dirt from my motorcycle seat (VTR250 from 1988) but a lot still remains on it. I guess it's ok for light cleaning but If you need to go deeper, messier stuff (still my seat wasn't THAT dirty), avoid it, it won't work. For a cheap price, you get a cheap result. I ordered some higher-end products (Leatherique,...). We'll if I can clean the seat that way! When the seat's clean I'm gonna give the conditionner a try so maybe the bad score (former 2*)  will go up within the next days...
B00CIVI51K|5|Perfect fix for my 2005 Frontier AC acting up! Very easy to replace!
B005CLMPPK|5|Great product at a fraction of OEM cost.  Fit my truck with no problems.  Installed in about 5 minutes.
B00K0QSKV0|5|All  necessary gaskets and O rings are included to do a top end rebuild
B000CMKDSU|1|Nice design and they fit well even with no carpet as my Wrangler has spray in bed liner throughout the interior. My main complaint is the weight and thickness of the liner. The plastic is very thin and seems like a cheap Chinese knockoff but it came in a factory Husky box so I can only assume they are genuine. Again the form and fit is nice I just don't see how this thin plastic will hold up over time.<br />Update: So after a day with these liners with the doors off with the bikini top only doing highway speeds the front passenger liner will float and is most prevalent  on the left front corner. I threw a bottle of water on it and all was well but this floating does not surprise me as the material is so thin. There was zero wind as it was over 100 F on a summer day in the back woods of Texas so there was no extra wind in the mix to make them float.<br />2nd Update: Updated to 1 star as these thin pieces of crap cannot be used with the doors off doing highway speeds as they will fly out. I spent over 200 on an entire set and the 3 months a year when I run a hardtop is the only time I can use these. Husky, spend the 2 extra dollars or whatever it is in the manufacturing process to make these thicker and heavier especially for the Jeep Wrangler model where one does not have to use the imagination to see that this product would be used without a top or doors.
B006SYNF9K|5|I have it 5 starts because the shade itself is good, but it's a little small for my car, even though it says it fits all cars. I drive a 2009 Hundai Sonata. The shade is about 3 inches short of the top and an inch or two short on the side. But the windshield of my Sonata is pretty big. But it mostly fits and it works well.
B00U83AZUE|5|very nice-perfect with my new seat covers
B00829HSY2|4|Purchased this for a 2006 Honda Civic LX 1.8. This is the exact same as the OEM water pump, which is made by Aisin for Honda, so you can save a good amount by purchasing it here. I deducted 1 star because it did not include new mounting bolts, which I feel should be included and changed. Otherwise works fine.
B002QGVW3K|5|It works great!  I needed a replacement for my solar panel and this is it!
B0016HPX4O|5|little short lol
B00B51BCSW|1|Part was horrible it last 3 month the truck is not a daily drive i maybe put a 1000 miles on it and it wore out already
B00NEL6HUE|5|It fits my Toyota Sienna 2007. Cabin air is fresher and just needs periodic washing and refreshing to re-use.<br />Highly recommended.
B00BD4J242|5|Most definitely yes and thank you
B009PJK5QG|3|Only compatible with Windows, not MAC. If it doesn't work with Apple, I won't own it. Otherwise good product.
B00CD3ZMH8|5|Great product fast delivery!
B00XBXNCI0|4|Fit on my trailblazer right on the front.  Nice and bright, enough wiring to put it where I want on my dash.  love the fact that ir came withthe harness

B00OA7YEHO|5|Good
B0012NSTH0|5|Great product, works great on my Isuzu pup project
B004R35MQI|3|The description says: &#34;Tilt feature allows easy trunk access and unloading of bikes&#34; WRONG. The one I received does NOT have this tilt feature. My two bike carrier made by this same manufacturer did which is why when I needed a three bike carrier I ordered this one. The only cotter pin in mine is to allow me to change from 2&#34; to a 1 1/4&#34; trailer hitch opening.<br />I did not contact the company who sold me this only because I needed to use it the very day it came since we were going on vacation. I didn't realize the tilt feature wasn't there until after I had already put the entire thing together. Too late to get a new one so decision was to either contact them and Not take our bikes on vacation or just deal with it.<br />Luckily the bike hitch was far enough away from my trunk and I was still able to open my trunk so this is why I chose &#34;It's Okay&#34;.<br /><br />Just be warned that their ad might say tilt feature but it doesn't have this ability. It ended up not being a problem for me but that might not be the same for everyone.<br />First picture shows it's a three bike carrier and the second is a close up of the only cotter pin there which is for the swapping around of the hitch extension from 2&#34; to 1 1/4&#34;. Also the pic on the page shows a red reflector, mine didn't have that and instead had a square where you could install one (but one did not come with it).
B00KK0R6MA|3|Overall very flimsy. Finish came in with rubs all throughout. Luckily I was painting these anyway.. The gasket tubing was not a good fit. I had to do a mod on my marker lights to get these to work..These definitely left something to be desired.
B00EFDAH1K|5|The parts arrived quickly and installed quickly and seem to be of good quality/Thank You!
B00L5QRXFI|4|Great deal! Thank you!
B001UFUD0G|4|Just complicated to put on my car
B00PXH81CE|5|These are absolutely beautiful and fit the wheels perfectly. The carbon details stand right out and look 3D. Looks like I need to secure the front and rear roundels in carbon now too!
B004T3BI1O|5|Very nice ladder at a great price!  I love how I can take it out so easily!
B00M10J2EW|5|I've have  had my battery fail me 4xs  & each time I've used my Porta jump it has never failed! It wrks & I totally recommend this product!
B005EMWSYK|3|Took some grinding to make it fit. Be ready for that. Mounted up easy enough, instructions almost not necessary.
B008XMBDX0|5|perfect
B00BGZ3XN4|2|Came quickly but poor quality eye hole ripped out right away.
B000C3BBKS|5|Had to take it to my mechanic to install. I could not access radiator without special tools.
B000CPI0QY|4|Seems to take care of the rust!
B0002Q7ZJ6|5|Super simple plug in, simple directions, even included the contact grease.
B000JZEZN4|5|Worked great.
B000GU11L6|4|It is what it is!
B00ES5QUJ8|4|They are 40% better than what was stock. They move out of adjustment to easy. You can see behind you from both sides now. I would like for them to be a little wider.
B00JN0U4SQ|5|It was easy to install on vehicle.
B0012TWSSA|5|Warm. Good
B005LQIT5Q|4|I'm really surprised at how well this little guy works! I have to tighten it occassionally, but otherwise I have no complaints! Make sure you clean it with glass cleaner and a soft rag...otherwise it scratches easily. It was super easy to install too.
B002UC6PWS|5|just what we needed
B001GBJQAW|5|Installation is a snap...
B00PGWHODS|1|I absolutely love the style of this, however, after maybe 2 weeks of use it began to leak from the sides and now it is beginning to crack on the plastic sides. I'm super pissed cuz its leaking all over and destroying paint but I love the look of it and need it. I believe it is just that the fluid is eating away at the cheap plastic I would only assume. Very disappointed. Wish it was higher quality.
B000CIQ47S|5|Perfect fit, mower runs much better now
B000BO6MBG|3|It is weak.
B002IV8EVQ|5|Fit perfectly

B004992OC0|5|exactly what I needed
B002UV0DZE|5|Love it, glad to find an affordable window for winter and other weather.  I wish that they had a way to secure the bottom flap in the summer.  I tie it up right now with nylon rope. I am a lady an installed it myself with a little assistance from my husband!
B00CXW0VIY|1|I was so disappointed in this product it felt cheap the charger doesn't work,(light has not come on indicating charge ) from day one!  I don't even want another one. Last time I order something like that online!!!!
B00FTQUIDO|5|Awesome deal!
B0049Z34UU|5|Product good. Great quiality
B00772HUJS|4|very good
B000C9GC8I|5|great
B00LEBLI82|5|This time I bought two packages and all seem to work perfectly. nice and bright but not hot enough to burn you. I left some of them on for about 20 minutes and then removed them to see what would happen and I had no problem touching them, if they had been incandescent bulbs they would have burned the crap out of my fingers. Good job.
B000H8Q7P2|1|Didn't fit our 2002 ford explorer sport as advertised
B00332GNU8|3|They fit great, but the double stick tape does not stay in place, in the summer heat tape works it way out some shows on the outside and some on the inside and sticks to the window making it hard to open. Look great, but has summer issues.
B000C2YCKA|5|fits like glove
B00B2HM21A|5|I am currently using these on No 17. four bolt heads successfully with Hooker headers. I am also using Stage 8 8916S locking bolts. It's been three months and still no leaks. What I did should have resulted in lots of leaks. I have no end bolts on my heads because Pontiac did not drill the end bosses to save money. I have a lot of faith in the quality of these gaskets.
B00BLZAW56|5|Super cute. little bit bigger than I thought it was gonna be. the wings are on a spring so they are jiggly. the scent kinda reminds me of nagachamp incense.
B00NJ0H24U|5|Excellent product for someone that wants to organize their vehicle.  This is a tactical looking organizer with molle in the front and Velcro in the back.  This product seems really well made and I haven't had any problems with it but I've only had it for 10 minutes.  But it looks like what I expected and I've already filled every molle loop!
B000C53RXK|4|question: is the selling price for a pair or for a single shock?
B006TMPDGO|5|A+
B00TXVKDG8|5|Good quality
B00CXAQ73Y|2|Doesn't fit good
B0007XUJOC|1|Does not fit to any pre existing holes on a 2005 Honda Element.  Please inform your customers that before they purchase.  Very dissapointed
B00YMTALJA|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B00LW5E2EW|5|fit perfectly
B006IV6CAW|4|Fast delivery, fits great, sounds Good
B00M1X6F9Y|5|Very heavily built and well made. Customer service was awesome when the first one and a problem with the lower link pin. Defiantly recommend.
B008B03HG0|4|I just jazzed up wiffee's ride.
B0031I2SP8|1|not right part 03 cav
B00K2QQUCO|5|Looks great.  Exactly what I wanted.
B00OK8VXI6|2|This took a little too long to get here, it comes from china and as far I can tell the quality of the tape is not top not. Would not buy again.
B00192HPOC|5|as described and perfect fit easy to install
B003YCAHMC|5|Brilliant service and product
B000HBNX38|5|Used this on horse trailer gooseneck connection where the paint was flaked off.  It turned black and hard and matched the look of the black paint.
B004KA0NY4|5|like the price
B000CITK8S|5|bueno
B00F0M350U|5|You are never really sure about this kind of product when buying on the internet until it's delivered and installed but these step bars are actually better than the OEM ones that came on my FX-4.<br />My next door neighbor has a lift in his garage and a couple of other neighbors came over and helped us install them, none of us thought the instructions were good but when we figured out how they went on it took very little time.<br />The brackets were heavy duty and fit perfectly, there were actually extra washers in case we lost some, paint was very good and they look good as well.
B00TABJWWM|5|these coils bench tested up to my spec's,and they out performed the expensive RED or Yellow brands- on my car.they were 1/2 to 1/3 the price of others.the higher priced coils may work for others,but not on my car.
B000UUMM6K|5|Perfect
B00OU67Z80|5|great light
B00H2VTGZK|1|Started falling off in a month, very disappointed
B0062BHQR6|5|My old one started to act weird so this replacement fixed everything, my old one was about 6 years old.
B00CXMPR2E|5|Good
B001UCGHTU|5|Perfect OEM fit for 1995 Accord LX. Great Product.
B00EK4F19W|5|A fun sticker, easy to apply!
B000C8ZE2Y|5|Perfect fit for my 98 Silverado
B00THPXU06|4|The helmet is generally quiet, comfortable, and appealing.  My only complaint is that it is very tight around the ears, after 2 days of riding 2000 miles my ears were killing me.  It would be impossible for me to install a head-set inside of the helmet for Bluetooth communications, but maybe my head is shaped like a basketball in comparison to other's heads.
B000C5SEPQ|5|OEM quality don;t bother with any other brand as this one has the fit and Quality as the original OEM filter at half the cost.
B0018QMJ68|5|My car is a lot cleaner using this Holder and Tray..I couldn't be more pleased...
B00WFIMJQ8|1|What a mistake! Money down the drain with no return on my investment. The device does not work.
B00IXDJWCI|5|Fit just fine, 03 wrx wagon, kind of a pain to get the bracket to line up with cover to get the screw in with no way to adjust the bracket once it's in place...but just stay determined and you'll figure it out.
B00APOFQYQ|4|The color of it was a bit darker than I thought. I have 2009 Honda Civic. But it was easy to install and works great!
B00HT2B77W|3|They are really bright but they are long and dont fit in most h3 light housings I have a couple different styles of fog lights and none of them fit so make sure you measure before you order
B00VEMKZJY|4|well presented product, and clear instructions for application. very professional.<br />- only discrepancy was the size of the sticker, was expecting a large graphic based on the display picture, but didn't bother to look at the dimensions.
B0002Z9R5W|5|PIAA Silicone Wipers are the only wipers I use now.  As long as you know how to use them properly, they are awesome.  Here is how they work:  Every time you use your wipers, it will deposit a little bit of silicone in any little cracks or pits in your windshield.  You cannot usually see all the little cracks and dents in your windshield but they are there, all over the place.  Then the water gets on your windshield and beads up because it doesn't like the silicone.  It doesn't smear all over the place like it used to.  I don't use my wipers as much or as often compared to regular wiper blades.  Also, the blades can recondition an old pitted windshield by filling in pits with silicone.  These wiper blades take a little bit of work for them to function correctly.<br />HOW TO GET THEM TO WORK:<br />- Purchase the regular wiper blades first, not the refills.<br />- Follow the installation instructions.  Most important is a clean windshield and run them dry for five minutes.<br />- Keep your windshield and wiper blades clean.  These blades are designed for water, not all the bugs that you hit.  You will have to clean the bugs and their mess off the windshield yourself.  Wiper fluid made for bugs helps, but not a whole lot.  Dirt and grime may build up on the wiper blades too so check the blades them selves.  Usually I'll just need to rub my finger, or the windshield cleaning tool at the gas station along the edge of the wiper blade that is usually in contact with the windshield.
B00CAO6SD2|4|My bad...should have ordered a longer length.  Didn't allow for the room that was needed for the hook to catch a hole.<br />Probably would have been just fine.
B0019I87PC|5|These Clamps fit perfectly on my Jeep 2.25 inlet/Outlet.  They hold the piping together strongly and tightly.  I wouldn't use any other exhaust clamps
B00317DNLM|5|Arrived quickly as promised enjoying these decals now.
B0077YWSAW|5|Works ok
B004N1NUM2|5|Perfect fit, arrived on time, great price... what more could I want?
B005CJ30XI|5|Installed in about 1 hour. What a surprise! The constant steering correction is gone. I can relax and just cruze with out being tried of trying to keep it between the lines. love this product!
B009995MTC|5|Awesome magnetic bumper sticker! I put it on a friends can and he drove around town with it! I couldn't stop laughing!
B00NF0KIOA|5|Great LED light for the car.  Nice and bright, fit right into place without any issues.
B00FT6A75I|4|was large enough to cover two miata's. not fitted for small sport cars. works well for larger cars. got money worth in material.
B002927LPY|5|Great replacement on my '07 PT Cruiser. Very faint difference in the red from oem, but that could have been due to the weathering of the old one. I replaced the original due to the bulb socket o-ring allowing moisture to get into the light. Fixed the problem on the cheap.
B00192JFF4|5|Does the job but assembly takes patience. Thank goodness for the tool included. Don't throw that away!!
B0042BDAVO|5|highly recommended. Car just right, very pleasant to enter the car in spite of the hot sun.
B00HCWZXZ6|1|Marketing was very poorly written. I wanted direct TV  bundle not dish network. This was a disaster and had to return it to Amazon at a cost of $26 to me. Fortunately for me Amazon agreed with me that the marketer did not label this product clearly and stood behind me. I ended up buying Winegard G2. bundle. It works great and is able to work on disk, direct TV, and Bell.<br />Thanks Amazon<br />Fred
B000FQ0BJ4|5|Part got here quick and worked great for a good price
B004YJTD8S|5|Very easy to install took less then a hour for both. Be sure to remove the sway bar on each side. That's all you have to remove besides the strut. I'm running 315/70/17 tires with a -6mm offset, they are 34 in tires. I had to do quite a bit of trimming to the wheel wheel and parts of the fender, but it looks great. I would still recommend using 33 inch tires so you don't have to deal with rubbing.
B000EQ6AKE|4|stock manifolds for cheap
B0033I5MHM|5|Everything ok, service and product
B00MPQ3CZ2|5|checked out ones that my brothers had bought, this is by far much heavier duty and better built than theirs. I would recommend this for anyone with trailers to move. Excellent product, very solid built.
B0089AHYNE|5|I bought this because my factory tube was cracked and didn't see the point in putting a cheap plastic unit back on.  Very happy with all my AFE pieces
B001BFO16M|3|The master cylinder works as a master cylinder should.  I gave it 3 stars because I had to reuse my reservoir.  The connection on the bottom for the low brake fluid warning matched my plug, but the locking tab was off-centered.  Mine is in the center.
B00BYH6C1E|5|WORTH EVERY PENNY
B000C9DCHW|5|This fixed my AC on a 2003 Vibe.  The clutch was not engaging due to a faulty magnetic coil.  Check other possible (cheaper) faults first to be sure this is the part you require.
B0049W2VDO|5|Works on our RZR 900 and easy to install
B006B71M08|3|Wobbles in hitch and has a poorly designed tightening system.<br /><br />Had to design my own wedge system to hold it in place.<br /><br />Includes grey molded step I can't see in picture, that I have gotten used too.<br /><br />Otherwise does and works as advertised.
B008427D88|5|Fits most holes to replace original clips on 2003 Ford Escape.
B00SUYB3F4|5|Thanks, item as described
B00II3M86U|5|I used these in my camper as reading lights. They work great, and use less power. Very bright.
B00OPPL22Q|4|My daughter loved it (too bad it was too wide to fit on her bike)
B00M4L55A8|4|Product is great for shooting metal flake and pearl ... runs a little thin does not Bury patterns well.....will use again.....
B006EGAIII|5|These are perfect for so many garage jobs.  Gave them as a gift to my husband for oil changes and they are great.
B00BFE4OPC|5|Loved this item!!  Literally took me a 31 year old female about 5 mins tops to install.  This was for my 2007 Nissan Titan SE.  About a year ago my a/c was blowing only on high, then last month it decided to cut in and out and then finally died a week later.  I looked up the youtube video on what was wrong, found the item # at the Nissan dealership ... low and behold they were sold out.  So I came to Amazon, had it prime shipped and now i'm back with ice cold air during the peak of a very HOT TEXAS SUMMER!!
B00XX63BBI|5|Product  is wonderful. It's going to make my life easier.
B00335HFX4|2|cheap, cheap, cheap
B0002JMEFS|3|Seems to leave an undesired residue but overall works good.
B00J594B5C|4|Love this stuff, but the box arrived with the liquids leaking all over the place. When a replacement was sent it was the same, wet mess.
B00NH1W52U|5|The people at Unity are freaking awesome. i bought this and they were very helpful in explaining how it all works and get put in and everything. after the install i drove the truck and man it drives like a brand new truck. forget your air suspension and drooping front ends. Unity is the way to go!
B006573A6I|5|Works great for replacement shims in the E46 M3!
B00OK8DBZO|3|The glue on the back of the stripe is not as sticky as it should be.  It peeled off in spots on a properly prepared surface.  Also, the strangest thing happened. As I rolled the last bit over the fender, I could clearly see where the stipe had been seamed, as if a larger roll ended and the manufacturer simply seamed a new roll onto the end of the first.  A VERY cheesy way to maximize material.
B00THMAAWU|5|This is the wire diagram you will ever need for a 1964.5 mustang
B0051WSD56|5|Works perfectly. ..just like it's supposed to!<br />Another fine product from Winegard.
B005FN2F5U|1|Spend the extra money and buy seat covers that are made for the make and model vehicle you have. These are made to fit a host of different vehicles. The fit certainly isn't satisfactory at all. If you pull to hard while trying to get them to fit nicely you will rip the tap right off the seat cover. If I hadn't ripped the back seat cover in installation I would have returned these seat covers, in my experience they were junk.

B00VYNCT4W|5|Extremely satisfied!!  great deal👍🏻
B0073I332Y|5|Arrived fast and completely matched!
B000VDLNVG|3|Great, made my helmet smell and fit like new but it is SO overpriced, what a shame!
B00B0WT0HQ|5|Nice and light and will keep the dings of your car while u work. Nice looking too
B002KO5W66|5|Arrived as expected. Love em.
B005P9WXMY|5|Class item for any Benz
B002SJBXLQ|5|Arrived on time an just what we wanted.
B00BITJUGW|5|Perfect
B000XQ2S4M|5|Ir a ver y good
B008F8Q8K0|5|Very nice. I wish the bulbs were included, but it was a good buy and really spruces up the front end.
B0022UOU6Q|3|doesn't work like it supposed to but it works ok
B00KTJ0KA2|5|Works and programs just like OEM at 1/10 the price!!!
B000C5YCRA|5|Fit my 01 Tacoma and fixed my p0420 code. The original part had 236k miles on it. Always use denso for my Toyota electrical.
B00S1993PK|3|They look great but the adhesive is not good at all.
B0033WDG58|5|Just what I needed
B001O7PNS2|5|Simply a product that when used as directed does a job better than expectations.
B0030WM7BU|5|It works
B0013ERRT4|3|Works as stated in the description. However, the netting does not stretch the entire length of the Heininger bar, and does not hang as shown in the picture. It has a little slack and drags on the bed floor quiet a bit. Still a great product.
B00REYP3SO|5|GREAT
B002JH4GMK|5|Love it! Came super fast and looks great on my car!! It stuck pretty nicely, very pleased.
B004MU8VRS|4|Looks good
B00HRXNLIG|5|Quick shipping and easy install
B00E5Y2T6K|5|100%
B00TA62M1K|1|Worst product ever. Such a cheap imitation.
B00DD0WL5Q|1|made in china crap! not only did they not fit as advertised, but they easily ripped in several places just trying to put them on. So badly, I never got past the driver's seat. They're going back into the package (which also ripped closing the zipper) for return.
B00CQFNYYQ|1|FIRST of all the packaging, this is a delicate item, should not be shipped in an envelope, SECOND it arrived broken, one of them, THIRD it did not fit the opening on the lamp is much wider than a H1 bulb, I believe why is so cheap, it does not work at all, that is the difference between a $50 and a $6 the cheap cost you time
B001HXBRX8|4|Awesome Decal looks sharp on my ride.
B008A5XOEG|5|Half the price of buying it at the dealer. Take them to a local key cutter like home depot and then program it yourself. They will only charge you for a normal double side key cut. It was delivered in the usual 2 days. How to program:  start car with regular key. Stop and remove that key, and put the new one in the ignition and turn it to 'on' within 15 seconds. The car will sense the new key and program it for you, and you will see the anti theft light in the message center light up for about 2 or 3 seconds. Then try to start the car, it should work. I did 4 new keys this way.
B0097CDPBI|4|Good tech and customer service.
B0091OE6K6|5|A+++++
B000E8UZB2|5|it works
B007UST696|5|It's a good product.
B0000UUX34|5|Have had a K&N filter in many vehicles and noticed the biggest improvement in coasting, shifting smoothness and excelled action in my new used 2011 Jeep Wrangler.  Continued to be amazed by a simple $60 investment.  Thanks K&N!
B00V3XFFE4|5|Holds it down
B00029X2N6|4|great like it very much
B0083YDQKQ|2|Lights do not fit the brackets right, they wiggle and shake and move freely. Also the brights have a line at the top that isn't adjustable so my brights cut off lower than truck height and make it hard to see when driving up and down hills.
B00GSU2RS4|5|Helps keep my husbands bald head very warm in the winter. Does not feel scratchy.
B00NXH47AG|5|Came in quickly and was a very nice quality.
B00HJEGQQ2|5|These things are bright!
B007CDYXT2|5|As advertised...thank you!
B000EDOT7I|5|These are amazing and so simple.
B00Y4JM98O|5|Fits great in my 280z and gives it a more nostalgic look and feel. It is quite a bit heavier than the stock knob but I wish it had the shift pattern engraved into it. For the price its excellent and I don't regret it!
B00COGK3O6|4|Excellent product
B006FLMEI4|5|They are a perfect fit and hold up well.
B001G3UO6U|5|Great product
B0016IACXK|5|Good product...installation a real workout!
B001A3KPYM|1|It was terrible. Did not meet my expectations, I would send it back but it would cost me more than it is worth. Could not get it  folded.  It is not like the original one that I had  Sorry only one star.  Not satisfied at all.
B002DL4HZ8|5|First time ever working on a small motor. Was a little intimidated but this book was the bible. Great book and came way faster then expected
B00PTFJN2W|5|Fast shipping, great deal
B005G5S3F8|5|The fit of the boots are great for my narrow feet. I've had them for a 1-1/2 seasons so far. No issues.
B000AURZ08|5|Fast shipping fair price!
B00718VZ8A|4|They take a bit to adjust - it would be nice to see them switch to a thumbscrew fastener or something a little easier for adjustment.  They use a small pin and clip now, and the clip is small enough and close enough to the body that it's a little tight, but the chocks do work well.
B00HWCUDME|5|Works as described. Wish the neck end was little longer. Still a good product.
B004OHTRE0|4|Works OK a little hard to hold table and slide the two to get her<br />W
B00252BWOY|1|THIS DOES NOT FIT A 97 TJ
B001GKGCXM|5|worked like a charm
B0081KAW18|4|The picture is misleading.  You don't get two bags; it's a picture of the one bag's two facets: expanded and closed.
B004AJ352W|5|Worked as they should.
B00JOLIJZY|5|The hat is just as I expected.  This seller was the only one who had the color I wanted.  Unfortunately, the decal was something I did not need.
B00J5SZAIK|2|Looks exactly like the OEM (unlike the lifetime parts store replacement) and fit perfect, time will tell if it's reliable, I'll try and remember to check back in, bought only 1 due to the reviews on poor fit, going to get another, give them a few months (replacing working but old packs, had 1 fail unexpectedly that was replaced with the aforementioned parts store part) so I'm trying to replace them proactively since it's a common failure), then buy 3 for the back bank as long as it works ok.  I'm working with a 2006 Toyota Avalon.  Update: One coil failed after less than 6 months, while these are vastly cheaper than any other coil, if the three on the back side of the motor ever fail it's a huge pain to get to them and you need a new set of 10 dollar gaskets.  I'd rather pay more for something that doesn't fail but I can buy 4 of these for what one OEM equivalent runs.  We'll see how the warranty service is and how the rest of them fare.  If this was a one off and I get a replacement I'll consider raising the review back up.
B002R0YMZK|5|great price
B003AOEAHC|5|Great product. Heavy duty and I'm sure will last for years.
B00WP4SOTI|4|quick delivery, 1 day.  Fair price for the set. Time will only tell if it lasts.
B00JXEP6PS|1|I don't see why u say it's an 24&#34; when it's only 6 very un pleased
B005H7D6Q6|5|Perfect part and fit
B00H3TQ136|5|adds the shine I was looking for
B006NYHTL0|1|First one I received was leaking fluid already. It was all over the inside of the bag. Still had fluid in it though. Also in the rubber it had a hole that looked like someone cut out. Decided to return it and order another, figured I just got a bad one. Second one was even worse. Had a even bigger whole. And this point I'm still wondering if it's supposed to be like that. Although this one had no fluid inside, non that I could hear from shaking it a least. Returning this one immediately. Already bought an oem mount for double the price of this junk
B004039HH0|5|Love them
B002L7ECKY|3|The quality of the emblem is good but I didn't expect to have to remove the front grill to install it.<br />The original emblem was plastic and clipped in. This emblem is powder coated metal and have to be bolted to the grill.<br />On a GMC Terrain, unless I'm missing something, it appears to that the removal of several pieces of the front end is necessary to complete the installation. There's no easy way to get your hand on the backside of the grill to screw on the nuts.<br />I'll have to take this to the dealership to get it installed properly. That's an additional cost that one should factor into the price before buying it.
B000AMBHGE|5|HOOKED IT UP IN 10 MIN.  WORKS GREAT.
B005BNZFQ0|5|just what i need and as described
B00WMNIFPA|5|what I order was exactly what a was expecting. Thanks.
B000COMX3Q|5|An easy swap out with this high quality lockable lug nut! It is exactly what I wanted to add some additional security. These lugs work and fit very well!
B00KXE3ZPU|4|I love this cute little bow sticker. I've had mine on my car for about a year now and there is no way that thing is ever going to come off on it's own. It's been through rain, snow, and sun and still looks like it did when I got it.
B00R5VADJK|5|Everything they were suppose to be. Very easy to install....
B008HT78BU|5|Got this keychain for my husband for a little gift. Didn't think he'd like it but he loved it! Going to buy one for myself now.
B00TULYD62|5|GREAT BUMPER. LOOKS GOOD AND LOW PRICE!!!
B00THAETMO|5|I love it!
B0055PPY56|3|Vent pic is not right. only goes up halfway. Needed more than heat to seal gauge panel (goop). Door handles are only half the trim. Money wasted.
B0038YNA16|5|Works Great!!!  I used it to polish and wax my daughter's black 2009 Honda Civic.  She is a college student and her car is always parked outside in the weather and next to sprinklers on campus.  Using a good polish removed the watermarks from the clear coat.  I then applied a good layer of wax for the topcoat.  I was amazed at how easy this machine handled throughout the entire process!!!  See attached picture.
B002HSAMK6|5|use it all the time and it has done the job just fine
B00BD4SK0Y|1|did not fit my 2014 Chevy Cruze
B00CHQ0F1E|5|Arrived quickly and in good condition. These are great connectors that are sturdy, makes good solid contact and can be permanent if you leave them alone or easily disassembled and reused. Good assortment for different wire gauge sizes. I especially like to use on automotive wiring projects.
B00GSAUHB8|3|It's well designed and for storage. However I found it difficult when using it - it would be great if there is a clear instruction on how to use it or a better recommendation on which types of cars are good fits.
B00BD52OSW|2|These covers did not fit the 2004 buick rendezvous. Very disappointed after looking it up and it confirming that it would fit.
B002UC6UA0|5|Arrived as expected.
B005UUIP3O|4|Good buy.<br />I hope to never have to use this but will gladly carry it around especially when I run solo.
B0078T1Z5K|5|Just to let the world know, and especially the person behind you.
B004QEM7TI|5|Excellent
B0012RI7SM|5|Took less than 30 min to install, had harder time removing panels than hooking it up, worked great
B00332GNEO|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B00NF40C7O|5|Just what I expected
B00N55IGLW|5|Versatile cover for the back of my Cooper S. It can be used in many different configurations.  Protects the back seat or the cargo area with the seats down. Even works as a picnic blanket!
B004A6JA2O|5|Works in my 2012 Toyota Sienna.  Saved me a trip to the auto parts store.
B0073MELT4|1|Radiator cam damage waiting to see what happens with replacement, shipping and compensation
B001AIZ5HY|5|Can't believe this works. Had clouded lenses on a 2008 Toyota Tacoma 4x4. Followed the included directions exactly and when I was done (about two hours as there are several steps) the lenses looked almost new. Surprising because during the process, it almost seems like it's making the lenses worse. Used a standard 14.4 volt DeWalt as the tool necessary for the &#34;grinding/polishing&#34;. Kit comes with everything but a drill/polisher. Had enough materials/product left over to probably do a couple more pairs of lenses.
9539752620|5|Sticker arrived in perfect condition an looks great!!!
B007KPR5QA|4|It seems to work very well!  Thanks!
B000QJG1HG|5|HONEST REVIEW<br /><br />AT IDLE.<br />These things ALMOST soIund like a stock muffler, with a bit of rumbling to it, Which is a PLUS unless you want to look like a complete poser or want your car to sound like a beat up pick up truck 24/7. (It gives the car a sleeper vibe with a hint of &quot;ill leave you in the dust if you want to race&quot;)<br /><br />AT LOW RPMS<br />VERY NICE sound, rumbles nicely, Not excessively loud, but definitely noticeable from the inside and out, Deep sounding, performance sound (again, not so loud that everyone on the street thinks your a D*****bag)<br /><br />HIGH RPMS/WIDE OPEN THROTTLE<br />THESE THINGS ROAR, Imagine the T-Rex from Jurassic Park in a smoothie blender, At this point, you are not only an A**hole,  but you are also a 5 time Nascar championship holder. VICIOUSLY LOUD AND DEEP SOUNDING. American muscle car sound.<br /><br />GREAT BUY, If you go to an exhaust shop they will charge you anywhere from $100-$130+ for these, at $80 free shipping, you cant beat amazon.
B00HCSBQ7Y|1|Only second day and already three of the lights are out......very lame won't be buying cheap leds again.....and now a week later other side has 3 more leds out and flickering....some type of circuit issue and I can't return them cause the brackets are tack welded to my bumper brace...  so now I'm stuck... definatly a defective product
B002UZXU3W|4|Good quality looms.  Easy to cut and run wires through.
B0023VFHYS|5|Small amount of grinding inner Shell for bottom fit nice fixture exact match would buy again
B00ESQKIHM|5|LED has a great AMBER color and works well hooked up to your car's dimmer.
B001MOZ152|5|all ok.
B001O0XMHS|5|Bought these for my 04 accord and they work great. If you're looking for good quality and trying to save money these are it. Been about a year since I've installed the front/back pads and they're still just as fine. A lot cheaper here than at the store.
B000SNBSMI|5|This cover fits my Suzuki Boulevard C50T with room to spare.  I haven't had any issues that some reviewers mentioned regarding fabric tearing or anything like that, although I don't put it on and off on a daily basis.  Just when there's rain in the forecast.  I'll update if I notice any issues.  For me, I got my bike for $3K and its definitely not in mint condition, but it's my first bike so I'm ok with that.  Overall, this cover is well worth the $20 it cost.
B002J7KCOG|5|I'm housekeeping challenged, have a crowd of big dogs who come in at out at will, and I live with a lot of sand. Essentially, I live in a big dog house. Dust is incredible and no way in the world can I keep up. These make it much easier to dust and get most of the nooks and crannies of the few things that aren't under cover (gave up having &#34;decor&#34; when I got deep into rescue some years ago). I haven't tried them wet.
B007H2PRBQ|4|Used this to replace the exterior outside door light bulb on my motorhome.  It is really bright, almost too bright.
B004EIAADG|4|Good product
B00CPN0BB8|5|Nice product but I've felt a better quality carbon fiber vinyl before. However, you pay for what you get. For some reason, it seems like the surface of this product is dirty...as in sand on paper.
B007ZLGSPI|5|Great deal for the money...
B006962RYG|4|Beautiful sticker.  Lokks great on my car.  We have extreme weather here in Vegas, and it is starting to peel off at one edge.  Color quality is still good though.  It was inexpensive.  I'd buy it again.
B000C9TTRO|5|Good quality.
B006EGAIII|5|These are a little wider and stronger than the last pair I owned. One thing my last pair had was a rubber piece on the bottom to grip slick floors, these don't have that.
B00JGJH8RY|5|Amazed at how much difference this item makes in stability!  LOVE IT!
B0045WBVUM|5|Break-in period was really tough on my ass. I threw it on my bike just before a 4500 mile motorcycle trip, and it turns out that the first 500 miles were JUST as painful as the regular seat, but the second day of 936 miles was like riding a sofa. The best way to keep the butt from getting hot-spots is to use this comfortable seat and then manually move it around while riding to keep blood moving around. I wouldn't use this for riding around town because it does take a bit of the 'feel' away from riding through the corners, but it is good for riding 'distance'.
B00K2NQ0AY|5|Everything ok, service and product.
B003YOBN1Y|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B000BR3BQ2|5|Product installed 3 days ago. Love it on my 02 Tacoma 2.7! The most obvious improvement is throttle response. This product has definitely increased HP and acceleration for my truck. It also sounds a little meaner, previously thinking that was not possible.
B00VXVX38G|5|Very happy with my order
B00NHBYOA6|5|Cools very well - contents remain cold even in scorching 110 deg heat. Consumes very little energy - about .5A - stayed on overnight on battery (2 deep cycle batteries and did not drain any significant amount of juice.
B000C2U740|5|Very nice product! Worked well!
B00GSAUHB8|5|It's great, I have noticed a great difference in my VW CC. it fits like a glove, thank you.
B00J2PKA54|5|Fit great good shipping time.
B000C11JJ8|5|great fit  thanks
B001DMDRUO|3|The Blue Ox tow bar has the receiver hitch bolted onto the 2 towing arms. The hitch does not fit into the bag so you end up with the 2 bars retracted and stuffed into the bag and the hitch hanging out the end.  Not what I thought it would be.
B00XB27QC4|5|Will this car set fit a Nissan March model 2012
B00VWRCA2G|1|I bought each of these lights and after 10 hours 2 has stopped working and now the manufacturer is giving me a run around and does not want to lie to them very no professional
B005NLQAHS|5|I'm really glad I found this.  The adapter works perfectly no batteries required.  Synced seamlessly with the Torque Pro ODBII app for my android phone.  The adapter recommended on the Torque Pro website was going to cost close to $100 with shipping.  This one was less than $20.  I was able to clear ODBII error codes after replacing my 02 sensors, passed emission test with flying colors.  Plus I now get realtime info on my phone showing, revs, speed, vacuum pressure, coolant temp, acceleration, throttle, boost, hp, 0-60 times, quarter mile times etc when this devise is paired with a OBDII phone app (sold seperately).  The phone app lets you record trip info showing engine diagnostics and monitor fuel efficieny.  You can record and save your trip info, email stats, view test results and graph your cars perforamance.  Being able to check and clear fault codes will save you a boat load if you work on your own car a bit.  A must have for any gear head or auto enthusiast.
B000RZR2W2|5|My husband and I are cleaning up our boat getting ready for vacation. Went to amazon and searched for the best boat cleaner and I stumbled on this washer. I tell you what, it works like a miracle. The description says it all! Highly recommended!
B00CN40Q1O|3|it was real cheap so it is just as cheaply made
B00RYES5CU|5|It's perfect thank you
B004X973EA|5|fast ship this stuff is the best on the market
B000GU0MMU|5|This extractor works well. Easy to use, easy to empty.
B00E8TAEZU|5|Worked great.
B008E7U8C6|4|Update. Brake pads work fine. Buy the caliper hardware kit. Replace the little spring steel clips that shoes slide on.
B00BFDFY6Q|5|It worked. After 160k I received a message to check fuel cap. I bought a replacement from autozone and the message did not go away. I bought this one and the message went away.
B001Y8XUL8|5|Excellent product.  This is a great, cheap alternative to metal hubcaps.
B00GURQX7G|4|Great product it work soon as I put it in, didn't have any problems.
B005FQH96C|5|Outstanding installation directions and online video gave me all the confidence needed to install this &#34;All American Product&#34;
B00TO5Y2VU|2|Too small, and shrinks flat when you sit on it.  I returned it with no problem.
B000CSWM5G|5|Excellent.
B005CHFD62|5|Great sticker.  Great way to discretely represent the men and women that wear blue.
B009M8ETLM|5|Great quality fits my 2011 Eos perfectly.
B000C0Y9FK|5|Fit great, works great and as soon as it was installed the light on the dash that had been on for quite a while finally went off. Definitely the right part.
B00C0SQ92I|4|slightly different tint compared to stock shoei
B001SB8PNO|5|Smaller than expected but soooo cute! Love it
B007UN1BKS|5|Very Comfortable and breathable. I wish they made this with nuckle protectors, but I still a great product.
B0007Y4P8W|5|Worked perfect. Was exactly what I needed
B00H2DI4GU|4|The screws that came with the mirrors did not fit on my F4i. They were bigger than the original screws, so I just ended up using the originals. Definitely look great on the F4i. They match perfectly with the headlight design and made the bike stand out better.
B004I0HPFG|5|part is as advertised and was shipped quickly.
B00HCOZEQ2|5|Very good deal and easy processing, exactly the right part.
B00412YT8W|5|Great price . Easy  30 minute install
B00EPPZQD2|4|Good price compared to HD !! Looks great once on bike. Detachable hardware is a little sloppy but once on motorcycle its good. Also hardware was shipped in plastic bag with luggage rack and their were a few small scratches on the chrome but need to be up close to really see.
B00O0ESM7A|5|These are awesome!
B0002KKPXK|5|The tool arrived fast. I used it to re thread a stripped bolt hole on my BMW M3 and it worked great. This saved me from spending more than $1000 on having a shop remove a portion of my engine to drill new threads.
B0009OA4JO|5|Seat fit my tractor very well. Nice quality seat. Very easy to install.
B00L4N4594|3|it is ok but didn't work for me because I have a spare tire on the back of the car  it is also wide enough
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great product. looks/feels like a quality piece
B0064FTX0I|5|Very, Very Nice!  Quality item. Update Jan 2017: buying this again - new car needs one too!
B0009NWQWI|3|I have a Jeep Patriot with no crossbars on the rack. It is nearly impossible to attach this bag by yourself. I ended up just getting frustrated and waited until my wife came home for an extra set of hands. The metal rods are not enough to give it shape. I ended up lining it with empty boxes to get my stuff in. My mistake, I should have ordered the clips to attach it to the door seam. Once attached, it was very nice not having the extra stuff in the vehicle.
B004IARL32|5|Very nice led smoked Light, It's easy to install Looks great, just could be a few bucks less. But Happy with Quality, Looks and function..
B0050HJNW4|5|Bullet proof tool. Does the job!
B001RZ48NW|5|I am very happy these bars. They look great. They do however limit the turn radius as my son discovered.  It made me reconsider letting him ride it. I have plenty of turn room. How fast and sharp is that kid going??
B004FPP4IY|5|I love this product installed with new rear diff cover noticed better mileage.
B00HAWLG54|5|fits perfect..
B002NUKDMK|4|Just have to cut to size and stick. Very easy and does not take long. Looks good for chrome strips also.
B002C7E5FU|5|Worth money
B0097SBAPK|5|Good stuff.
B00QYEUSSA|5|Hey......I read some reviews on this and was kinda skeptical about it at first. Wondered what all kinds of alterations I'd end up doing before getting it installed on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. But.....I went ahead and ordered it and am so glad I did. I didn't have to do anything except bolt it on like the instructions read. I did go a lil' further and added a piece of heavy duty nylon screen between my grill and this piece for a lil' bit more filtering of bugs and grit. Looks great and should last for a long time. I love it !!
B003LD1MUU|2|These wheel covers look fine - however, on the first one I installed one of the plastic clips broke as soon as I tried to put the cover on the wheel.  And the cover came off 1/2 mile down the road.  If the next one I put on breaks, I'll be returning them.  More to follow.
B002PQUDKO|1|not good
B00802G41Y|5|I've purchased many brands of aftermarket HID kits in the past and this is one of the better ones.
B00WGRJ8AI|5|We all know these aluminum stems are a poor design but if you are looking to rebuild your working TPMS sensors, these work perfectly.  I was able to restore 3/4 factory sensors but, only because one sensor was damaged during removal.  Not sure these sensors will stay in for the life of the vehicle if I need to change the stems every 4-5 years but, I do like the individual tire pressure monitoring system.  Hopefully by the time they need to be replaced again they will have a rubber stem alternative.
B00B87RJFI|5|came when it should.works great
B0039HHZVS|3|Seems to work good but bolts that came with it stripped when i tried to tighten them fully. Used old bolts just fine and working good now
B000CMD5BM|3|Good belt.
B0002NYDZI|5|I've bought and thrown away many cheap grease guns over the past 50 years but this one is a keeper.  I'm sure my grandchildren will get a lot of use out of it.  It really does the job for me and is durable.
B0052XN2RI|4|Love the product....if the product had a better clamp that actually held the tip on steady it would get a 5 rating.
B00PXC5PNC|5|Easy install. Nice fit.  Seems to be a solid piece.
B00VEDWKVY|3|Only 3/4s of it came on, not happy but it looks good
B00OLHQSYU|5|beautiful item
B000CAINEI|5|Works great!  It's easy to put up and take down.
B00OWFXZ7Y|1|I returned it.  Parts did not fit my car.  Still waiting for my refund.
B009DJS50Q|5|These have been on my 97 Blazer for 8 months and no problems. they were a direct fit.
B006ZNLDAW|5|Arrived quickly and is exact fit.
B00I3OE7JK|5|Good
B00K325MC6|5|Nice set of Gage's for the do it selfer. Come is a case so that u can put it away when not needed.
B00LX0C8XS|2|My experience with this product (8 gauge, 12 foot version):<br /><br />I recently purchased a new car, and I wanted to get a new set of jumper cables.  I’d been using a set I’ve had for years to start everything from compact cars to large pickup trucks.  But, they were getting kind of ragged looking and were clearly not classy enough for the new trunk.  I looked them over before retiring them to the garage and noted they were marked as 10 gauge cable.  I decided to error on the side of caution and order 8 gauge for the new set.<br /><br />The new cables arrived on time and in good condition.  They are good looking cables with sturdy clamps and a nice storage bag (even including a pair of gloves).  I stuck them in the trunk and considered the matter closed.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, I had occasion to use the cables for the first time.  I was jump-starting a pickup truck from a small car.  Not an ideal situation, but not uncommon either.  I brought out the new cables and hooked them up, but no joy.  Not much power seemed to be getting through.  Just then I noticed smoke from under the hood.  These cables had gotten so hot the insulation on the clamps was catching fire.  Naturally, I quickly removed them.  (Note: the included gloves came in handy at this point as the cable was too hot to touch.)  After driving home and retrieving the old set of cables, I was able to start the truck without difficulty.  The older (lower gauge rated) cables didn’t even get warm.<br /><br />After some research, I see that it would have been better to use 6 or even 4 gauge wire for jump-starting the truck engine.  Technically these cables may be adequate for smaller engines.  However, when it comes to jumper cables you don’t get to choose what’s at both ends.  You are either helping, or accepting help from, whoever you happen to encounter.  Cables that will literally catch fire if you hook them up to the ‘wrong’ vehicle aren’t really useful.<br /><br />In any case, this product did not work for me.  It’s debatable if that is because it is a poor product or because I had unrealistic expectations.  Apparently they made jumper cables a lot ‘heavier’ back in the day.  So if you are basing your cable weight decision on the performance of an older set, you would be wise to bump the gauge up a notch (or two).t work for me.

B000B5ZM6Q|5|Looks good. Good fitting. Will buy again when the time comes
B004K9EQNE|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B002QS6ZSK|4|works fine
B002GUL8O4|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B00FYX2FQK|5|Fast shipping<br />Great bussines
B000LVIN5W|5|Fit is perfect and much cheaper than any other place I checked.  The only issue is the decal came off.
B000FOUB8M|5|Perfect for hauling stuff around. I'd give it a 6 out of 5 if possible.
B007WMRCL4|2|solenoid started to stick in less than a year of service on my 1995 honda 300 fourtrax
B006QGD996|5|So far so good.
B00418U0AM|5|Came super fast. Easy instructions to apply. Very pleased with purchase!<br /><br />**update**Has lasted a long time with no issues, cracks or peeling.
B00VMUA82W|5|works great!
B00NES10CM|4|as described with fast shipping
B0007D31LU|5|Very pleased with mirror caps. Excellent delivery times. Look really great on the vehicle too!!!
B0028BVDRS|5|fit the first time real heavy duty
B00XUQT976|3|I must say the final look of the brakes came out well.  The draw back was it took 5 coats to get it there.  My brakes were Brembo and they were painted red.  I wanted green so I cleaned them, scuffed them and it took 5 coats.
B0012PQBVE|5|I love that you can get true AC Delco parts from Amazon, no more paying out the nose at the dealer.
B009OQ9Y0I|5|Awesome Fun Plate for my Beachmobile!!
B00KAHL7Y6|5|Accurate description and installation instructions! Best pricing out there and fast shipping. I will definitely order from them again!
B001C4SLOU|5|As described. Reset fuel economy in computer, gained 1mpg
B00C4H2YXI|5|The GMC dealer wanted almost 200.00 for enough retainers to install my new bumper cover. These cost me about 15.00 and were exactly the same as the OEM pieces at the dealership. They are EXACTLY THE SAME !!!!!  Go figure.<br />The sad thing is my brother works at this dealership. HOORAY FOR AMAZON !!!!
B00BH1FPJW|4|I like them just what I expected!
B008E32NJ6|4|just fine thank you
B00AKQAD88|5|Love it
B004A2D4V6|5|Perfect AC now!
B007VRD0D4|2|Low quality and I have built my own I just tossed them in the trash not even worth returning.
B000IMB4CI|5|Worked great to get the musty smell out of the ventilation system of my Wife's van. We use this combination every 6 months or so, and it works nicely!
B00400XFQ2|5|I needed a puke can for the oil vent on my old Harley Shovelhead, This was perfect. There were some bad reviews on this item for not having instructions etc. If you don't know what it is or how to use it, why are you ordering it. It's not a complex item.
B009AUVGQI|4|I have a Subaru legacy station wagon and these went on very easy.<br /><br />The plastic U clip falls off the wiper but you can set it back in there easy enough. I guess it's made to come off easy if you need to swap it out for the modified clip that comes with.<br /><br />These wipes are all rubber. They don't have the metal frame on top.<br /><br />It rained the first day I put the wipers on. They ran quiet with no streaking. So far so good.
B00VESZZV6|5|Very nice quality and stitching.
B000MD4YNY|5|Works great
B006U8PAX8|5|good
B0007TF75W|5|Delivery was fast and part same as you get at any dealership.
B001EOYIYA|5|Super easy. I don't know why I waited so long to do it.
B004U9B8O4|4|No issues, seems to protect my bike well.
B000C5I6YA|4|pretty good quality for the price. Fit was good and snug
B000WJ87PY|3|I like the grip of this steering wheel and it protects the leather in my car. It's a good buy.
B00BFSYKOS|5|I bought these because the were cheap and it is my fist time converting a vehicle to leds but I am very happy with these leds. For the price you can not beat them had them swapped in 10 mins I now plan to use these leds to convert the rest of my vehicle. They are bright and have great color.
B00GSAUHB8|5|These are easy to use and store, very nice.
B000BKJDKM|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B000WK5LUC|5|Fit very well for an after market shroud.
B002M3P828|5|Great product.. Works great..
B002UC1BLS|4|Using with a B&W RVK3600 hitch and a 19,500 pound 5th wheel, and it does the job.  Keeps the top of the hitch clean.
B00K3XW37M|1|Cheap plastic, does not come with support in the middle so I added screws for support and it still came apart from the bumper once I got up to speed on the interstate. Save your money and do not purchase .
B002KCQWIA|5|Perfect fit<br />Great Price.<br />Fast Shipping.
B003T7XUE4|5|I've put these on every diesel truck I've owned.  Makes the more frequent oil changes required a less messy and simple task.
B00P5YM0VS|4|Yes, these use adhesive. That is where the similarities with stickers end. The silver part of the ST inlay are clearly metallic (I don't want to say metal because I don't know what the material is), and they are convex to match the factory Ford caps. Excellent quality, and they look great on my Tuxedo Black Focus! Beware: Do not make a mistake, because the adhesive is so excellent it will be extremely difficult to try again! I will get this set as many times as I get wheels for my ST!<br /><br />EDIT: After one year, I had to take a star away. Initial quality is high, however the red has faded, and now they are pretty much just silver ST logos. Not a huge deal, but I am replacing them.
B00T6J8C6U|4|Fit perfect the 2nd time. had to buy 2 to get it right. You have to understand the curve before you can get it right. the key is 2 sided tape as a reference point. you use the tape to rest it against and rotate into place, not just a location reference Trim 5 stars instructions 2 stars..
B00G52L3SK|5|Great replacement same as original
B00ZC20NUS|5|Great tool for situation, and easily fits in my pocket when I'm on the go.
B000GTTXOE|5|Perfect
B0002M9PCA|4|length on this is pipe to pipe not chamber length, not sure why I got confused but I have my moments. I flex pipe the rest, sounds good on my 98 ram 5.9 gas, not loud, I was thinking it would be louder. but I'm happy with it.
B00BOU76RA|4|High quality, exactly what I ordered, got it fast and I love it. Great product great company
B00C42TPTY|1|Failed after 3500 miles. OE unit had 192,000 miles on it and was only replaced because I dropped a remanufactured engine in my 98 Explorer. Thought it was the smart move at the time. This is a PITA to install. You have to remove the upper intake just to access it. Be prepared, as another reviewer commented, for some frustration.
B00062YW06|3|Oil gauge did not work after two sets
B009B8UUZ2|5|Very thick and solid.  The panels fold, but they do not bend.
B004H2QGRS|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B007T9BSXS|5|wonderful very happy
B0049VZN8U|4|This fit our Polaris perfectly so that we could attach a small trailer.
B007HRN4N4|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B00KN0UOEE|5|Good price
B00029WYVW|4|Excellent
B0082RGJIA|5|Look great
B001FAGJB8|2|The rear ones didn't fit well and came off pretty quickly. The front however offer a nice layer of protection for those of you that don't have steps and might hit that area more often.
B00XNWGVWI|5|8 yo son loves it
B00EJEWY02|5|Love them , get questions from other Jeep friends where to buy them.<br />They make the old girl look great<br />Feel so nice to sit in. Super glad we found them
B00C5RHTG4|5|grate fit and look.
B00D8Y780U|5|Great
B00C0SQ8KG|3|Be sure to use rtv on the ends otherwise it fogs up.
B00QY8N91Y|5|Fits really good ☆☆☆☆☆T/Y
B010PDSLH0|3|Dang.  This looks like a fine RV porch light with an nice, efficient LED light and lense.  Unfortunately,  it was the wrong size and not a true replacement for my melted RV light.  Upon closer ispection, this light measures 6 1/2 inches wide, whereas and the one I am replacing on on my RV is 6 inches wide. Close but no cigar!  More importantly, it has a different screw hole pattern.  So much for just eyeballing it!!!  It turns out my original RV porch light was a Bargman 30-78.  Bargman now has a model 34-78, which I am guessing this Lumitronics is probably a replacement light for the Bargman 34-78.  So make sure you order the replacement with the right size.
B001G6MJFG|5|This item was an excellent replacement in appearance and perceived quality for the inner tie rod end that I removed from my 2005 C55 AMG. This is not a job that you have to be that apprehensive about. Buy a replacement boot first and then have a go. I broke mine loose using large adjustable pliers (the flats are about 40mm apart). I removed the inner and outer tie rod ends while still together and used that to create an exact copy (in length) with the two new tie rod ends.
B00KC39BE6|1|Too big
B00L81X6OM|5|Package arrived a week sooner than expected, and its a perfect fit.<br /><br />Thank you
B00LSTWNCU|4|Ok first to review. So far not so good. Package arrived quickly but was missing most of the parts. Only shocks and the track bar arrived... So now I'm sending it back to try it again. I'll update the review as I get there at of it and install. UDATE: went from two stars to four, would be five stars but shipping was a hassle. The lift installed easy and looks great. I have put about 2000 miles on the lift kit and it is a better ride than stock.
B004MUHKHU|5|I purchased this to replace the one in our camper that split after a freeze.  It is the exact match to the original and was easy to install.
B000ET9SAA|5|not much to say about it.  is what it is
B00C1YI2XA|5|Super Bright!!!! this are amazing lights
B00NBSHP2Y|2|First, I have a Sena SMH10R Bluetooth Headset installed on one of my helmets for about two years, so I have based my review on an comparison with the S3.  Although I love the size and discreetness of the S3, the performance is underwhelming.  The size of the speakers are larger in diameter and wider (to accommodate the electronics and battery), so for a helmet with already speaker pockets, I had to modify it with a larger and deeper hole.  Unlike the 3-button SMH10R, the two button set up is a bit difficult to navigate.  I do not mean pressing the buttons, but the timing holding and releasing the buttons.  For example, the 3-button SMH10R, I have a center button and a (+) for a particular function.  But, the 2-button configuration of the S3, if you hold a button a second too short, or a second too long, you get into a different function.  For sound, the sound is not as good as the SMH10R, but I think it has to do with the hardware configuration.  My intention was to put the S3 on my dual sport helmet (especially for the long rides), but the wind noise of the various vents and visor drowns the S3 sound.  Now, I use the S3 on a street helmet.
B008PJ94U0|5|Close to as factory as possible!
B00HAQBEH0|5|I really like the LED strip array technology. When I saw they had it in a camo design, I had to have another one.
B000OUZA4W|3|Some of the bolts were not there.
B00L2PJGWK|5|I am very impressed with these running boards. They fit great on my 2015 Honda Pilot and no drilling required. All hardware came with the running boards no need to buy or modify the brackets or running boards. I would highly recommand them. The seller was great and shipped fast. Save some money ..... Ok save a ton of money buy these..... They look similiar to factory running boards but half the price. Well built with aluminum frame with a rubber matt afixed to the top with a super nice polished stainless steel edge that looks amazing. This product really does sharpen the look if the vehicle. It also is very helpful for my three little boys that have to help themselves in and out of the vehicle.<br /><br />If i had to reorder again i would totally reorder these running boards.<br /><br />A little side note.... Takes about 45 minutes to install.
B004GCS7DA|5|Perfect fit!  Great price! Delivered quickly!
B001GNE1JG|5|Well packaged and good price
B0088BX0IM|1|Quit working after the second use. Waste of money.
B001GEV5FI|5|Easy to install, I use it as an alternative to T-case drop on a TJ with 2&#34; lift and it works well.<br />Do not forget to loosen the gearbox mount before installation.<br />After installation I noticed an increase of engine vibrations, but no big deal, we are talking about Jeep
B008G30OS6|5|Perfect. Matches OEM.
B00EKEGRVS|2|It is very cheap, but I guess I should have known by the price…. It was dropped on the floor in my car and the spring flew out (unable to locate it) and I had to throw it away because it would not close.
B009IULKHU|5|Makes me laugh every time I look at it satisfied
B0065UKQ9O|4|Perfect fit and great quality. Installed in a 2011 Ford escape limited.
B0016KA7TW|5|installed on 05 dodge ram 1500, 4wd, tool 6 hours to install by myself, worst part was drilling thru truck frame, but once drill out it hooked up fine and works great pulling 9000 lb 5th wheel about 3500 miles, very satisfied, would buy again
B00M9WLEDE|4|Excellent fit for a 2015 subaru forester. Smell is a bit obnoxious but I'm sure it will go away in a month or so. Stitching is a bit on the rough side as I had to trim a few ends of red string, but was not a big deal. Overall would recommend this product.
B005TTZB56|5|Great for sway
B00T4TEWBQ|5|This is a really nice trash bin for the car. It's a good size so you don't have to constantly empty it and you can take the actual trash compartment out and clean it! Love it!
B00O9ZUQV0|5|Love this, can't wait to see it installed.
B005ERWCNM|1|Horrible product, fits the car perfectly., but only lasted 3 months.Will not continue to buy from this seller.
B00BMTZRWY|4|does what they say it will do
B00UZE8C1A|5|This brush worked really well with my bmw z4 soft top. It does come with some loose hairs that others have struggled with. The trick is to brush it vigorously and lightly pull away the loose hairs for a while until it seems to stop. Then after you've gotten most of the loose hairs off just use a lint roller on your soft top after you've used this brush to scrub it & let it dry.
B007KA7PP6|5|So far so good. Mower starts a lot easier.<br />Fit perfectly on Sears craftsman mower.
B00DPBNQQ6|5|these bulbs are way better than the stock bulbs on my john deere lx178.  I took the tractor for a night drive to see how they work and i had lots of visibility.  They will be great for night time snowblowing this winter.  very happy i purchased these.
B006G14FK8|5|Slow but sure.  However for testing and rejuvenation this will do the job
B009Z3SQ90|5|love this stuff !!!!
B00GUF74HQ|5|I love this thing. Anyone who has a truck should buy. I've already convinced 4 of my other buddies to add to their truck. A must have.
B0009IBJE4|5|Works great. Good product for the money.

B004D0EAUE|5|Excellent Experience.
B009LN4S3C|5|The rack and pinion does not leak after installation and driving 2000 miles with it. I would recommend this product to a friend.
B00CMUD8E6|5|Easy to replace. Very noticeable change in ac.
B00FB3KZHY|1|These are not worth it.  High been burnt out on mine and caused my jeep to act funny..  also the lights where not any better that the factory lights.  U did get a full quick refund.
B000IG5PZQ|1|Doesn't keep right time. We put this in our RV and every day you got to reset time if you want yo be close . It's 1-2 hours off a day. And doesn't stay on the wall. The size was fine for me but complete trash if it doesn't keep time
B000KID2ZC|5|Just as described. Fast shipment.
B008G3K76K|5|Perfect fit to replace the cloudy and cracked assemblies that I had.  They make the front end of the van look new.
B001G5U32S|5|I installed this thermometer on my Audi A4 last year and haven't had any issues with this part.
B00NU0BSIA|1|Smells good at first but the scent fades easily. Just now my girlfriend pointed out that it has a date on it and has passed expiration. I will not be buying this line ever again.
B0036GNVNI|5|great stuff.  Use it on motorcycles, lawn furniture, car engine, etc.
B000C2AMPE|5|Works!
B00KCMQW3A|4|Little disappointed in it thought it would look nicer .
B00DSD867K|5|Uplifts the room. My daughter loves it. Holds excellent on painted concrete walls.
B00HE8LHYE|5|Fit perfect 2004 Ford Explorer XLT
B007I75D8W|5|super bright and great quality. Be sure you have enough room where you are plugging them in for these are much longer than what you will be replacing.
B000BLMJN4|5|Fits with no issues. Price is about 40% less than auto parts stores.
B0010GFSF0|5|Excellent quality and perfect fit.
B002ZBWKAU|5|the best little tire inflator you can find. Great price and easy to use and works great.  My son has one, too
B001CUNFGI|4|It is what it is! R 134A refrigerant for about 1/2 the price they charge at the auto stores.
B00HJE5GI6|5|These things are bright!
B0084UI0BE|5|Love them!
B00KTIQBWY|5|I purchased these two remotes for less than what a local dealer was going to charge me for ONE GM original and they were GREAT.  I also programmed them myself in 30 seconds for NOTHING when the dealer was going to charge me an additional $60.  JEEZ!<br /><br />This was money very well spent.
B0007Y4P9G|5|Item as described.  Replaced a cover knocked off by a tree on our fifth wheel.  No issues.
B00DR0H8O6|5|Arrived on time and just what we wanted.
B009K6IW00|1|SUPER BRIGHT BUT FALLS APART DURING PLACEMENT
B00IPQWXZQ|4|Haven't been through a winter with it yet but it is thick enough to fill the gap between my truck bed and tail gate.  Seems to be sticking well but I've only had it on for 2 weeks.
B000GAP428|5|I changed a oil, power  steering, air filter at 366 center street, Quincy. Ma<br />What's a great work! Wonderful team!!!<br />Special thanks to Alicia.<br />She is very professional, honest,  carrying person.<br />I will be back again.<br />Sincerely,<br />Tatyana Leader.
B00HRMT320|2|Led goes dies in 2 months
B00LRJSC44|5|We had absolutely great service from this company. Our part arrived with a broken piece-they kindly and immediately took care of it. Our lawnmower is happily running now.<br />EXCELLENCE!!!
B00NY7JM64|5|Hi, i only receieved the blue and hot pink one.. But i ordered another one.. (Light pink)
B004GETUY8|5|Perfect match for our 2001 Toyota Corolla. Unbolt and bolt in..no adjustments necessary.
B000X90YUO|4|I have 31&#34; x 10.5&#34; tires and i air down from 35 to 20psi when i go wheeling... Takes about 2 minutes per tire to get back to 35psi and it's well under the duty cycle time... Super quiet.
B0046NUOLM|5|It was shipped quick and is definitely bigger than stock. This weekend is the big test going on last summer vacation. Wish the nut was part of it. Had to go get a nut for the steering stabilizer but it went in great.
B00HCROOR4|5|Great product, install was simple and fit was perfect. Seamless shipping. Will definitely order again for my other car.
B005PZMLDY|3|I bought the product and thought that it was okay. The cloth is definitely more thicker than what I thought it would be. However, my car is a Toyota Corrolla 2013 and though this is a universal seat cover, it did not work for my car model. Otherwise, I liked it very much!
B00TKIC5LA|5|Good product straight forward description and works great.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Perfect fit for 3 vehicles.  All are now used to organize trunks.
B007OSL3DY|5|great product. easy to use.
B00943TYY2|5|looks very nice
B00OO1OQBU|5|I'm so happy item came fast ..works perfectly..

B009DJWOZI|5|Shipped quickly, installed easy with good fit and works fine.
B008CFC60C|5|The bumper I ordered came on time as promised and in excellent shape.  It fit the car perfectly.  Nothing to say except I love it when things go off without a hitch.
B004ZG7TT0|5|Quality product.
B008KZ0EO4|5|Worked great with the trailer brake control
B0072PIJM2|5|Arrived on time, USA made product and will fit vehicle purchased for.

B000CSEX30|5|Wix is the best
B00VZP1IXW|5|Magnatek Smart Flares - Emergency Roadside LED Flare/Beacon Kit. This flare kit comes in a sturdy black case for safety, storage, portability, convenient, durability and gifting. There are two flares per kit. They run off of 3 AAA batteries and run for 20 hours with fresh batteries. Each flare has a strong, durable reflective, waterproof housing and 3 different light settings. The settings are: flashing red, steady read and beacon light/flash light. Each has a magnetic bottom that fits into a stand for placing on and around the vehicles. You can remove the stand and it attaches to vehicle by the magnet so you can place it up higher than ground level for better visibility as to be seen when vehicles pass or approach. The strobe and LED flare is said to be able to be seen at a distance of 3000 feet in the dark and 1000 feet in the daylight.<br /><br />Why use the Magnatek Flare Kit and for what reasons?:<br /><br />Flares are designed to signal distress, emergency assistance needed, and provide a warning/signal to oncoming vehicles of your location. This helps protect you and makes sure you are seen for your safety and theirs when you are fixing a flat, have your vehicle broken down somewhere, battery dead, stalled, out of gas, engine problems, wreck, collision, and even for medical assistance to get help. This is a necessity for all who travel to keep in their vehicles. This is great for each vehicle, boats, cars, trucks, to put in camping gear, hiking packs, RVs, college dorm rooms, homes, first aid kits and etc. These not only can be used when traveling, but at home if you are needing help, assistance and medical help. These will bring attention and make others aware of a situation or emergency need for help. These can even be used to help notify police when you need help. It can also be used as just a flashlight. It is bright and effective but not so distracting to disorientate passing vehicles. This is to be used effectively day or night and in any weather conditions, rain, snow and fog to signal help. These flares (being battery operated), assures no fuss, mess, fumes, fires, sparks or damage like the fire ones cause making them safe for any condition and environment. These assist in giving help to loved ones -may it be elderly, kids, husband/wife, family, friends, college students, sick or whomever need help. These give them access to relaying that need and signaling for help. They also offer a safety boundary so others see you when out in the dark or on the road before it is too late to swerve or stop. I know this is in my car and gives me great peace in knowing they are there should I need them, they are available. These offer an extra precaution and help when needed. Imagine camping or hiking and getting lost, fall and no one is around. You can use these and signal help and will be seen if anyone is near or airplanes above. Or, if you are stranded on the side of a road working on your flat tire and it is foggy and dark, you can place one in front and one in back of the vehicle to warn both directions. Or if you are home and someone is breaking into your house, you can put these in windows if you can't get to a phone to call for help or preferably call too. Or if out boating and engine problems and too far to swim back, they signal for.others to help. They are also good should you need medical help, you can use these to signal if you can't do anything else. These would be great for home, vehicles, travel packs, first aid kits and for gifts for all you love. I did receive these at a discount for the opportunity to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I recommend for all the safety reasons, the value, convenience, peace of mind and they work great. Thankfully, I have only tested them and not had to use them for any emergency. However, having them gives me great peace and security as it will you too. Highly recommend.
B002JMGJX4|5|I've ordered this as a gift after I was given one. It looks great and I get a lot of comments on it.
B00GSZQ8NE|5|Replaced all the bulbs in my 2006 Honda Ridgeline. Everyone works like a charm. Very clean and sharp looking product.
B00PAEDUG2|1|Does not fit a 1963 Honda CT90.
B006ZCNILA|4|Put these on a 1998 Ford F150 super cab 3 door. They look great and work well. Installation was easy, but there were extra parts, two thin bars, that I had no idea where they went, were not listed in the parts list, or installation instructions. Tried various places they might go as they appeared to be for extra support, but they did not line up to any holes, so I just left them off. Step bars seem to be plenty stable without them.
B001GBTJRM|3|Product was on time and works ok, noticed that psi reads a little higher when compared to a mechanical gauge (2 too 3 psi difference)... And also this is my 3 sending unit....... Which sucks at over a $100.00 a pop
B0060YJ89O|5|Easy install on smart car https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwPPPiS1no
B000F6F99G|5|I decided to purchase this unit after reading about the Chamberlain unit being difficult to see.<br /><br />As long as you have a good mounting surface with nearby AC power, this item is easy to install and use.<br /><br />Once plugged in, the laser activates and you simply aim the laser stem to a location on your dash to indicate when to stop and you are all set.<br /><br />After setup, the motion detector picks up any movement within its range and turns on the laser for about 10-12 seconds.  I've found the laser turns on just as a vehicle enters the garage and this seems to be enough time.
B0058NS4MA|5|Great product and I'm very happy with the buy. It's not 3m but it did an amazing job. The wrinkles came right out with a heat gun. If you are looking for a diy vinyl wrap this is the one. The prices is good and the end finish looks professional.
B004AYZBJW|5|We have several late model 4 cylinder vehicles.  I've noticed that adding fuel treatment every 8,000 miles or so helps keep up gas mileage for us (a great indicator of engine performance).  Getting this sent to me on a regular basis helps remind me when to add it to our vehicles and at the same time gives me a break on the price.
B00VES3XOM|2|I could not fit my full face helmet into this box and had to return it.  Only to find out that the return shipping cost me $20.  That really hurt on a $43 box.  I ordered a larger Bestem box and I am extremely happy with it even though the cost was about double.  Don't try to save money by ordering the cheapest alternative.
B001GJ3FEC|3|Kinda of too big for my female hands. Would be good for a man, I think. Washed my Lexus with it twice and had a hard time getting it super clean. I found that using a microfiber cloth worked better. I could get more elbow grease. If your car is just dusty, this will work nice to wash it and be gentle on the paint. If it has some sticky spots, you will need to apply more pressure than is possible with this super fat sponge.
B00KL3ALGO|4|These shades are easy to use. My previous experience with car shades has involved suction cups, they just stick to your window without any extra accessories. When not in use they are compact and come in their own case for storage. I Am pleased with this purchase, the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is I'm not sure how durable they are in the long run, but at this price point I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again. As a plus this is a small company and was contacted by them to make sure I was satisfied with this product. Great customer service!
B00B9HCI44|5|love it just what I needed
B00LZWAZFC|5|JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY BOAT
B009F4JHHO|5|Magical! Coupled with the Torque app, this device told me more information that I would ever need. Interpreted and then cleared my error codes in my 2001 Dakota project truck. Great tool!
B00IV7OW8U|5|A bit tricky to apply (little fingers, etc.) but oh so fun to have on the car!  I wish it were bigger.
B001LHVOVK|3|Works as advertised.
B007ZLMN6G|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B0060KJNAC|5|Fits just right easy to install
B00KDBDAF8|3|The end pieces don't attach to my Yamaha r6 2005 model
B009X1WQEU|5|Wow what a great product will buy again sealed perfectly I would recommend this all day long.
B001G79JM6|5|Just replaced my oem E39 M5 arms with this, A+ quality stuff.
B002R4V2VS|5|real good clearity from headlights
B00QW8JP8C|5|Put this light on my atv and wow!.... What a difference. I did a voltage reading before my light was on and after and is only drawing .3 amps where the halogens were double that with half the brightness. Recommend this light to anyone out on the trails. I can now see a mosquito 40 ft in front of me at night.
B00J45HL5Y|2|Kit was very dissappointing and cheap.  No prep gear and the instructions are not clear.  If this is your first time doing something like this I do not recommend it.
B00LNDP9CW|5|This worked great at a fraction of the price for what Camping World wanted for a similar one!
B000OAG63G|5|Looks and works well in my Winnebago.
B00N2K6M2A|1|This piece of crap does not works, it does connects but won't give out them codes. People, don't buy this piece of S, h .i. t...
B0002T8FM4|5|Works as advertised
B004131NEY|5|Can't complain so far. Great price and works perfectly on my 2002 Acura RSX.
B0033QVL9C|1|This may be for some cummins, but not mine. This stuff is RED, not green. Now I have to figure out how to dispose of it.
B001BK63WC|5|WORK
B001UFRW0A|5|Well made, easy to assemble.<br />The instructions were horrible but I decided to just figure out the parts and their respective place.<br />I installed this on a 2003 Silverado 1500. It is best to remove the exhaust hanger but if you cannot do it the product will still fit.<br />The bar does exactly what it was made for so my handling is so much better taking curves. The only downside is that you will like it and will make you want to go faster which in turn will wear out your front tires.
B004SHB4VK|4|a little something something
B00168O4O8|5|Great product and fast shipping
B00OJT25TW|5|I ordered these in the KH3 black color and they look great. They come with automotive grade 3M double-sided tape areadly nicely applied so they are ready to install. When you first open the package and realize how much money you just spent on two little pieces of plastic it is a little shocking, but the fit and finish is perfect, the paint color matched perfectly, and they look so great once they are installed that I'm happy to spend the money for a quality product. Just make sure you clean and dry your headlights really well before installing so they stick properly, and take your time to line them up well when installing and you'll be happy too.
B003FNXNCQ|5|Still on...and oook great.
B00ELOI8SW|3|Works for me...
B00W81EAE6|1|Not a good buy. Missing half of the parts. Useless
B00V3IL29Q|5|Very good
B000WEPI4M|4|It's a great product to buy if you have a car without cup holders and the convenience of a compartment as well, but making sure the product will fit is tricky sometimes because it may look like it will fit or sure between your seat and console or whatever the case may be but it's so inexpensive, it's worth a try, I have used it on 4 different vehicles and 2 didn't work and 2 it did, good luck!
B000JIND4S|1|Doesn't fit as advertised.  Too short.
B00YML13OU|4|Saw one of these on another car and thought it was a great idea for our son with his learners.  The magnet could be a little stronger.
B002EOVDII|5|Great product, fast shipping
B00DILUBL6|4|a good value delivered to my door
B000R5IASC|5|This has the advantage of actually being able to depressurize your fuel system without getting gas everywhere.<br />Feels heavy duty. Well made. Recommend!
B006P88TJ0|5|Like this patch a lot.
B00F4WLH1U|1|Never even used before the battery wore out. When I replaced the battery it never came back on.
B00XAX4B9A|4|The summer sun is HOT! I park in a large parking lot most days and it has full sunlight during the greater part of the hottest time of day. When I crawl into the car, it’s stifling. That was until we started using our AlphaShades. This thing is big and covers the entire windshield of my mini van. It blocks out all of the sun and my car is a LOT cooler when I climb inside now.<br /><br />One of the things I love about it, is the fact that it blocks out the sun and my steering wheel isn’t burning when I need to get going. Plus the seat belts aren’t as hot either which I wasn’t sure it would actually work with. It’s hard to find a sunshade that fits a large window. The shades you can buy at any store are usually too small with major gaps so there isn’t that much protection.<br /><br />The only thing I found is that the shade is made of a very thin material, so in super sun, it’s still pretty freaking hot in the car. Though I am a firm believer it is still better than nothing and on most days it works well and keeps the car much cooler.<br /><br />I received an AlphaShades to facilitate this review, however as always all opinions are 100% honest and my own.
B0094JJDI8|5|Great product. Thank you.
B0048EXGBE|4|Fits my '04 Ranger perfectly (well, almost). Very easy install. Only gripe, mat covers VIN number on dash hence four stars.
B004X96DLE|4|Got rid of most of the scratches. The ones that are still there haven't been touched yet. I just have so many that I haven't got to them all yet.
B0027ERH8U|5|Fit my 2005.5 Audi A4, 3.2L (B7) perfectly. I'll get a few more next time.
B000RSTXG2|5|Part arrived fast and was a perfect fit for my boat.
B000CMF4J8|1|Flimsy!
B00U02PQR0|5|needed to update the navigation on my car. this worked perfectly!
B001AM8H8E|5|These Strut Mounts are needed to do a complete front strut repair on a GM &#34;W body&#34;... in addition to...<br />2each Gabriel G44459 Ultra Strut Cartridges ; 2each Gabriel 142143 Strut Mounts (top) ;<br /> 2each Gabriel 143060 Front Strut Cushion & Bellows ; Gabriel 143036 Strut Mount for the left side lower spring seat ;<br />Gabriel 143037 Strut Mount for the right side lower spring seat ;<br />1 pkg of 2each Moog K6641 Front Sway Bar Bushings (on control arms) ; and some new Ball Joints.<br /><br />Note that Gabriel 143037 Strut Mount for the right side and has the right picture.
B0066QWO56|5|Perfect fit on my E70 3.0si X5. Good price and working perfectly, what more can you say.
B000BNU54M|5|Good
B0068FUEV6|5|Works well in hard to fit oil filter locations. Very handy.
B00B1FD3BQ|1|Would be a 0 rating if available:<br />Check engine and another red warning light came on, acceleration did not work at all and rpm at idle was 1500...When the engine first started a lot of white smoke came out from the exhaust. I disconnected the battery for 30 min - same thing. After I took it off the check engine light remained and only disappeared after I disconnected the battery again.<br /><br />This is the second one with a problem! That's it for me
B0084BOZCQ|5|Good
B0009JKI86|5|They fit
B003XJ9UR4|5|No complaints arrived as promised and 1000 miles so far no issues.
B00MY93DXQ|5|Bad ass little grips I put on my 98 sporty 1200, throttle grip went on perfectly and the other I ended up wrapping the bar with electrical tape to fatten it up and it fits snug and looks clean.... Great product!
B00V36DVRO|4|The starter was worked well once I got it installed. I will look at the brushes in a few months to see how they are wearing.
B00L9A38GS|5|GREAT
B00032K4FG|5|Love the smoked out. Look
B00WAAGGU6|2|The form of this part will fit Honda CRV 2008 but on the back it's another different story. On the back, the 2 available tabs to install it are both in wrong places so they are not usable. In order to be able to install this instead of returning it, I have to cut those 2 tabs and only use the holes for screws to attach this to bottom part of the grill where this part is attached to. Then to the screw holes, urggg... I can only screw in the 2 most outer holes on the part using the same short screws the original part uses. I have to drill 4 more holes so I can screw into other available screw pockets on the this part and I have to use longer screw on 2 of the holes since they are not flushed to the bottom grill. And lastly the center Honda emblem... The original part has plastic arms with holes so the Honda emblem can snap into and stay attached with its tabs on the back, this chrome replacement part has nothing, yes nothing in the back for the emblem to attach or snap into!?!? I again have to drill 2 small holes in middle of the tabs of the Honda emblem and 2 small holes in the bottom grill section and use plastic cable ties to keep the Honda emblem in place. Pheewww... It took me a couple hours to install due to the modifications I have to do to make it work. So be aware when buying as this chrome piece  is NOT exactly the same as the original piece that it is replacing, at least for my Honda CRV 2008. Not sure about other year models that this chrome part is listed &#34;will fit&#34; for. It looks nice after installed shiny an all. I guess you take a chance when buying Non-OEM PART.
B001DKQL6I|5|Perfect fit
B007X5KH5I|4|Fits perfect<br />good quality<br />cheap Price
B006CRT72W|1|Stopped working after 2 weeks
B003I3GD84|5|This product is amazing. It fits my 91 Vanagon perfectly. I just wish that the made and addition square mat for the center area of the Vanagon. Pleas let me know if the make this square piece. The product is excellent. I am very pleased.
B000EVYGQY|5|Satisfied!
B004P23VQO|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this top!!  Took me a little over an hour to put it on (with a friend helping), but it's exactly what I want.  I have the top open most mornings, and I can just flip it closed when I park it - then flip it back open again after work.  Latches and unlatches easily after the initial break in of a day or two.  I can easily get into the back as well - sometimes I pull the bar and upzip it a little, but it goes back down easily.  The windows are super clear and from inside you can't tell the back window isn't glass.  Nice dark tint too - you can't see inside.  GET ONE!!!
B00COYNZJ8|5|This not only looks awesome, it has a very durable, high-quality feel.  I'm sure it will last forever.  Looks great, just like the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon inside your own car.
B002GP87NO|4|Batman.<br /><br />Easy to put on and looks very flashy. Good quality vinyl.
B00ADLHN3S|5|Best can you can buy.  Will not leak even under pressure.
B000KITSMI|5|If you EVER need to replace the Schrader valves on your car's AC system, consider this tool FIRST.  Unfortunately, it won't necessarily work for you in ALL cases because you need enough CLEARANCE for the tool to work.  For instance, if the shrader valve is in a place where there's just a few inches of clearance (just enough so that one can attach the filling valve to the schrader valve, for example), you may not be able to use this tool.  My mother's 2001 Ford Focus for example has the low side valve in the front FENDER, so I'm PRAYING that I won't have to replace the schrader valves any time soon.  Who in the right mind put valves you NEED to access to service your AC system BEHIND the fender. Making it so difficult to get to?  On the hand, my 1996 Honda Accord has both the High and Low side valves right under the hood facing straight up with plenty of SPACE for the tool to do its thing (that's the car I used this tool on).  So, make sure you have enough SPACE for the tool to be placed.  If you can confirm that, FIRST, I say go for it.  You won't regreat having this thoughfully engineered tool.  One usage will pay for the tool's cost, compared to the whole hassle and expense of getting your AC completely EMPTIED/VACUMED and REFILLED (the only other way to replace the schrader valve correctly).  A Great Tool!
B002LGZRCW|5|good poduct great price shipped on time
B007WIBS90|4|I thought that this had the opening for the speakers, although the material that it is made with is very good, so thats why I gave it a 4, I will be returning and see if you have one that accomadate the speakers.
B002P8HIUU|1|I've ordered 2 of these and the same thing happened to both. The small clip at the upper corner breaks off during installation  or shortly after. Now I have to find one that's better constructed. Would not recommend.
B007HRN4N4|5|Fast shipping. Excellent product!
B000CBLX1M|5|Relatively hard to find hydraulic filter cartridge for my Komatsu PC75uu excavator.  Price and shipping were most reasonable.
B00FZQ2S7M|5|Bought two of these for my 2006 Sienna.  The picture was clear enough that it was obvious how to remove the old ones from the top.  That's good because they inaccessible from the back.  The replacements worked perfectly.  It took less than 5 minutes to remove the old one and snap in the new one.
B000BPURAC|1|It looks good but doesn't fit as advertised
B0040DVL6U|5|Love this mirror
B000I66JEM|5|Work great and satisfactory
B00B9F328M|5|Fit perfectly, easy to order, on time arrival, great value.
B00JV95FFQ|5|Great Product, I had to take off all the sharp edges and add paint myself but it's a great fit. My tail lights will be well protected now. .
B0009JKI6I|5|These are great blades, installation is very straight forward. The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2&#34;, but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke. But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars. I guess there are no replacement for factory blades.
B00DOMYP5W|5|Bought this last year getting ready for a 6,000 mile ride.  Fist the price is an incredible deal but living in AZ I assumed it would be OK for my long ride even it they only lasted that long.  So I packed it in the saddle bag in case.  Turned out to be the best buy and move I have made in many years.  It is quality product that kept the rain out even when stopped.  I went through OK Willey Willey Thunder Storm with rain so heavy I had to pull over under shelter waiting an hour for it to pass.  No leakage when on the bike moving with a full face helmet.  When stopped in the rain no leakage any place.  The collar closes with a Velcro strip that is not even noticeable when riding.  Plenty of room because I had rain in MI and it was cold.  This suit on tip of my jeans, chaps, two shirts and heavy leather jacket with liner and winter gloves was critical.  I would not have made it ona 6,000 mile ride without this suit.  I order plenty big so the pants are bulky but plenty of space to get my legs over a loaded bike which is what was essential.  True if I tried to run in them the pants will slip down.  Did not need a hood with the right helmet glad it was designed to a tee for the motorcycle needs.  Sleeves have an elastic closure at the end keeping wind and rain from moving inside the jacket.  Legs have Velcro closures with boot straps to hold them down (you can detach them and did not always use them as the legs stayed down with the Velcro closure straps).  Jacket zipper has a Velcro flap that folds over on top sealing out the rain really effective. Jacket has a liner inside the outer rain repellent layer which is nice.  Pants no liner needed but also have pockets essential to have wallet and ID with easy access also nylon protective layer on the seat.  Just got done looking the suit over to pack away for the next trip and they show no damage or wear.
B001URT0YO|3|cheaply made but I only spent about $5
B00HNKYD0I|1|I put it on and it lasted a few days - it keeps falling off.  I tried everything to make it stay but the warm weather makes it fall off over and over and glue everywhere.
B003LJ13B2|5|Top notch! i put these on my buggy<br /><br />i was really impressed by these.  i found they were lying on the hot exhaust header, for some time, and there was NO damage to the silicone jacket.  Not just good looking, but top quality too.
B000EVYGZA|1|Poor Quality.Just received it and  I can't event trust the continuity test function  because I have to move the probes contentiously to get it to work. I don't know if the problem is in the jacks or in the probes. I can  touch copper filaments on probe cables (Safety issue if testing AC Voltage)  Waste of time and money.
B00UY6WFLM|4|Esay to install and fits perfectly. No tools required
B00N83S2ZQ|4|works great in a C6, but it's a little tighter in a C7
B001T8BCGI|5|Great product, fast shipping
B009HHHC58|4|It's comfy but no padding at all.
B0002F9YHI|5|Wonderful product. Makes my leather smooth like a baby.
B00W9792J2|5|Great price Great product THANKS
B00EN4MV9M|5|It's a well made product. Edges are smooth and sharp.
B00JY91FI4|1|The pink was a different shade than the pics in the description showed. It was much darker, almost red. Returned immediately.
B00QN849AU|5|Looks nice, satisfied
B00KRJ82FO|5|Great fit and easy to install. Make my key remote look like new again.
B001JT72PM|4|These come just as pictureD but be advised if you have TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system) on your vehicle they will not fit. I have it and cannot use these on my vehicle
B003AVV6S6|1|Amazon  says it fits my yukon denali XL. It does not. Only the bolt parts do. That sway bar bushing is way too short.
B00LCD8ISK|4|After shopping around, these mats fit the bill for what we needed -especially the price. Great quality mats.
B0068O1Q78|5|Works great for 2000 BMW R1100S
B00FB5W7ZA|4|Looked great on my helmet. Although I don't like the figerprints it leaves
B0068O1CF4|5|Works great for 2000 BMW R1100s
B0002UHVAA|4|We've only used it once but so far seemed to work fine.
B001O28622|5|Great for a Duraspark II upgrade. I decided to upgrade the points on my '73 Maverick to a Duraspark setup and this box eliminated ALL of the cutting/bypassing/car yoga. The input from the ignition(Wire formerly going to coil+) is just a trigger, so no need to bypass resistance wires. By using the module I was able to eliminate 90% of the work associated with the upgrade and the car has never run better. It started right up and after some fine tuning runs better than my brother's TBI GMC. Best part is, since I didn't have to cut anything in the column I can carry a points system and swap it out in 10 minutes if the need ever arises.<br /><br />Could not recommend more for someone looking to do a Duraspark upgrade.
B0028R1IHW|1|The shipping cost more than the sticker. Decal was around $5 and shipping was $6. This is a rip off !!! To top it off, the decal is defective, it bubbles up from the surface of my motorcycle faring and does not stick well. I have no way to contact the seller either!!! Stay clear.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Worked like a charm.
B00FJW5LSK|5|It is the right number for my 04 Buick Lesabre. Check with [...] before place order. I don't know why they have a second picture.<br />2 years now no problems.
B004U5F524|2|We are not very happy with these helmets. They do not fit our heads right, there is hardly any padding in the helmets at all.  Wearing them we do not feel that our heads are protected much at all. I bought 2 of these helmets in different sizes and they are both very much lacking in padding. We are not happy with these helmets at all. Putting headsets in these helmets is very difficult. Not a great purchase.
B008H3YGGG|5|works great
B00BXMRP4I|5|For the money how could I go wrong if the pump works.  It works.
B007C4SF86|5|Perfect match. even the hardware was great. more than enough. Bolted right up, no problems at all
B00KTJ8K54|5|Very easy to program and much cheaper than going to a dealer. I wish keys were this easy to program!
B00J5CVLUC|5|Works good and smells amazing!
B00KC39BE6|5|Needed a new battery for a DR-Power wagon. This one fit exactly.  Works fine and was much less $ compared to the DR battery price.
B00C7I4XT2|5|Works great!  I found that my rubber mallet also had a hook on the end that I could use.
B00WOYBOFA|5|Good buy-and-forget-about-it kit. It has the basics to cover any of the most common issues you may run into on the road, and is reasonably priced. The bag it is stored in is pretty nifty as well. Toss in any spares specific to your vehicle you may need (fuses, bulbs, etc) and you'll be set!
B004BYX8W8|1|I ordered this at the same time as a Trails Illustrated Map, got the Map but got stiffed on the Dorman part.
B00MXGFA9U|5|Great quality cover. Fit is good. I am satisfied with the quality and price.
B00418RSF2|5|This face decal of Mickey is on my camper window. Looks fantastic. went on fast and easy.
B009P8A044|5|Great harness for the price
B00AKGHP7K|4|This doesnt have the ABS sensor holes had to tap and die it but if you have an MP3 or a MSP you dont have ABS any ways. Great for the price though.
B000C7VYUG|3|Arrived with a huge crack in the bottom of the plastic frame.  Exterior box didn't look damaged so not sure how sturdy the plastic would have held up under the hood.  I returned it.
B007W8U1TS|4|nice rug but the background of what they shipped is blue not green
B0036WC7CS|3|its ok
B000KKLLFS|5|Good Product.Arrived Promptly and as described.
B0002KKTFO|5|I read some of the other reviews about this, and have to say simply that I was a dunderhead for not going this handgrip route 40 years ago--it pumps well and reliably, and I no longer have to fight the fitting with one hand, tuck the grease gun under my arm or balance on my chest, and try to work a full-length lever with the other hand. I work a lot on a perpetually muddy Jeep, and it's nice to make that chore a bit easier (and enjoy fewer mud clumps knocked loose and into my face!).
B00BJS9QMU|4|This would be an awesome set if the fill hose connected to a can tap
B008CE0W5Y|3|As others have stated the tail light assembly has an incandescent bulb for the side running light, and on one tail light that I received, the incandescent socket does not have power.  The bulb would not light, a removed the bulb and tried it on the other side and it worked there and then I tested it with a meter and there is no power to the socket.  Also the first time I got the entire assembly completed on the trailer it would not work, I removed one tail light and reinstalled it and then got everything lit.  The Harness seems a little touchy, so we will see how well it holds up.
B006LI7S4Q|5|very pleased. deliverly was ahead of scheduled date.The back of seat is high and supports back well and seat is very comfortable. Lots of storage and was easy to install. excellent instructions. very good buy for the money. Fits my 1999 honda 4 tracker perfect..
B002IC986A|5|Worked like a charm! And as hard as it was to get this part IN, you really don't want to have to do it AGAIN! ★★★★★
B00KMVFY3A|1|Very thick material.  Very well made!
B00PHPZ3NC|5|Great price. Works!
B001C9G7O6|1|Says it's for a 2010 gmc Sierra. Flex fuel 5.3l v8. It doesn't match up. Crawled under the truck before I even took my pan off and it's a 16 hole cork. Actual trans cork is 18 holes. Called fram and it's a complete different filter and cork. While returning,  I'm having to pay for return shipping  while I have a prime membership.
B012C6HP6Q|5|Great product. Way better than fiberglass. Will buy more.
B00JW1WH0E|4|Not quite OEM but close. Definitely worth the price difference.
B008G26UBM|2|They might look ok once you get them in...  But mine came with the housing in the back cracked out... Which made the shiny part of the front of the headlight flop around.  Used JB weld on that.. with a zip tie until it dried. With the way it was packaged (which was pretty good) i dont see how it would have happened during shipping.. Oh wait.. I guess it could have since the parts are so brittle and cheaply made.  I had to bed part of the bulb housing mount just to get the bulb out. And then modify it again to get the bulb back in. Not to mention when i was changing the bulb and barely applied enough pressure to lift the lock clip (it breaks on me)!! What a piece of junk!!  You get what you pay for... As cheap as they are and if you dont mind modifiying the parts then it might be a good buy over OEM part. But not near the same quality as OEM!!!  Everything about it even down to the little rubber vent tubes on the back side of the headlight are cheap... And even missing 1 vent tube per headlight. Had to take 2 off the original headlights to use and they didnt fit because the knockoff taiwan brand vent tube mounts are smaller than OEM... After modifying everything they didnt look bad though... Now lets see how long they last...  I was going to contact seller because the box states to contact seller before leaving feedback... But why... So i can get a replacement piece of junk... No.. people need to know what they are getting... Take a chance... Just plan on having some tools to fix or modify before you install them. I chose to change the bulbs because i like using Sylvania bulbs.
B000HBM8HU|5|Good for sparkplug applications.
B00HHNHM40|3|It's a Motorad thermostat in Beck Arnley packaging. Not the same as pictured..
B007TYH9H2|2|Pretty flimsy....works but the actual mirror Inside the housing shakes when driving.
B00P5YO4YO|5|I recieved the items I ordered. Satisfied customer
B004KPV29O|2|The workmanship on my jacket was horrible.  The stitching looked like it was done by someone that had been on the job one day.  Almost the entire jacket needs to be repaired.  I used to be able to rely on Joe Rocket for quality, but not after this.  There is no way this jacket should have passed quality control.
B000IYPSGO|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B004AITV9Y|5|its way better then the one the garage tried to sell me and cheaper
B000CPCBEQ|5|Best stuff for manual transmissions, shifts butter smooth after putting this in.
B0007IFX7A|4|Works well
B00CXKG8Z6|5|The  best ever!!
B004R44HFO|5|as expected
B00BLAG3D6|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B00EBGE14U|5|Washed window, applied sticker, left it on overnight during the summer, peeled backing off in the morning. Looks great.
B000N9I532|1|The seial does not fit everything it says it does. i know for sure that is a seal for a mercruser, not sure if it fix volvo but it does not fit omc cobra. the bearing fits all makes but the seal does not which is bs cuz it says it fits all thats why i bought it. i waited till it was deliverd before i even took my lower unit off then took out the gimbal bearing at which point i noticed its the wrong seal so i went to the local marina & ordered a stock 1 which was another $20 and i have to wait till monday to get it while my boat sits in the garage on a beautiful HOT weekend.. NOT HAPPY
B000QS2XQK|5|was exactly right.  very satisfied
B000OZS9Y0|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00077ZDUS|5|Fit was great
B002NOG974|5|Fairly easy install.  Look to YouTube for really good instructions.  The paper instructions are OK but seeing it done is better than 1000 words.  The E-Trailer 2014 Dodge Ram 1500 video recommends some cutting that isn't really required.  I followed the 2012 instruction video for my 2015 Ram and no cutting was required.  It fit right in.
B00M78820I|5|Best car shade I ever purchased and Bearded Garage is the best!  Family owned business with lots of class!
B00AURRN2Q|5|Good ol California smog made me buy this to keep driving my 97 GMC s10/Sonoma 4.3 V6. Had a local muffler shop weld it in. I previously &#34;passed&#34; smog by a flys ass hair with an old magnaflow cat but apparently I needed the newer cat EO carb number to &#34;pass&#34;. With this cat it passed the EO carb and sniff test well below average!!!  Better than it did in 1999!. Sooo stoked to keep my daily on the road! Thanks guys.  BTW  my truck has 239,500+ miles!! Wooot!! Love my mini truck;)
B0058J505S|5|I've ordered a couple of these, they look great and it's easy to install. I always have a great experience with Spyder Auto if i need to talk about anything
B0045SQWNM|3|I was good for a while but after a year or so the spring broke and the cover can't retract back.
B000ZJXASK|5|Large enough to cover my R1200gs. About medium weight, can fold small enough to take on trips.
B000FSDZTU|5|This stuff is amazing. I have a pop up camper that was covered in mildew and grime, and this product made it look like new.  It was recommended to me by a boat guy, who swears by it, and he was right.  I sprayed the canvas down with the hose, sprayed on Amazing Roll Off, light scrub with a brush, and a spray rinse.  Sparkling.  Get some.
B00KWMCITC|5|great product... thanks
B000CF6I40|5|Worked perfectly for my husbands 2008 dodge ram 2500.
B00Q6U0E1I|5|Love this. Sassy. Put on my Marilyn wall. Looks good. Just wish it wasn't a plate.
B00GPSI38M|5|Looks nice and super easy to install
B000KL74IU|5|Best vehicle floor mats I have every purchased. Should have got them when the vehicle was new. When I get my next vehicle I'm going to incest the dealer throw in WeatherTech mats as a part of the deal.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Jumper cable are very long at 20 feet and they look beautiful.  They have heavy duty cords with thick gauge wires.  Exactly what I need to give people a jump start.  I was working before with a shorter 12 ft jumpers and that was very difficult to jump people's cars.  My old jumpers at 12 ft were just not long enough. My new 20 footers are awesome, length will no longer be a problem.  So if need jumpers I would suggest always buying 20 ft with thick gauge wire so you won't run into any problems!  Great product here!
B005UB4ICU|4|QUICK AND EASY TO INSTALL.SO FAR THEY ARE GREAT.
B001GH5PDS|4|Works as advertised, easy to install
B000C1A2IC|5|Looks great
B007V2C0FS|4|Bulky to store. Best cover we've ever had. Incredibly well made.
B002HIEUSQ|5|Wow is all I can say exceeded my expectations with communication. Helmet looks very nice
B003ZM9XW6|5|good items
B003XJ2X78|5|Awesome price and quality excellent fit .
B0031IBS4A|5|I can't believe the auto parts store wants $95 for this! My 07 Suburban front blower stopped working and I thought it was the blower itself. I ordered this since many other people have had the same issue where this went bad. It took a little more than 5 minutes to replace and fixed the problem perfectly.
B00GRSOJSS|4|Really works but you needto give it time to do it's magic. You can reuse but a few times seems to be the limit.
B00AGMCC3A|5|Exact fit for the GL450 2011. Good quality
B002E1AYKY|4|Glad I choose the larger SUV size.
B000EPUDSK|5|Works!
B00636BNUQ|4|Looks great, Wrench is handy!
B00FQSTZ34|3|I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE BOOTS DID NOT HAVE THE EXTENSION CAPABILITY OF THE OEM PART, SO THEY MAY NOT LAST LONG. THEY FIT BUT NOT VERY WELL. THE  PACKAGE CAME WITH TWO TINY ZIP TIES WHICH WERE NO USE..HAD TO GET MORE ROBUST ONES.
B0007NXVB0|5|Works great. Great deal for the price
B00VGL7I0W|5|great product. love the hook attachment also. I recommend this product
B001OMVCIC|5|works as expected, just perfect
B0036GNVNI|5|Best motorcycle cleaner on the market. Spray on cool bike let sit and just rinse off.
B000C2Y1KQ|5|very good hose
B00JG3OHVK|5|Exceptional quality and value
B0068FVAS2|5|It works great in a 2015 Suzuki DR200S 4T! Got here pretty quick. I would buy again.
B000FW2NEY|5|It's get fits good
B000B8N3BY|5|It was perfect n came the next day as promised!
B009PJKAZW|5|works well
B0012GTVVA|4|Looking forward to installing. This is a very useful item to allow easy exit from a camper. Very practical.
B00JBIDBGC|1|I got mine. Looks great. Not sure if I'm happy. Seems like it's stripping already!!  Get ur product right fore u sell to consumers!!
B004W5TJMO|5|The tail lights were perfect! They changed out very easily and in not much time.
B00BJXSGN0|4|ya worked great brsure to ware gloves when pulling fuel pump assenble and have a catch pan
B0014F74FY|5|Came in a timely fassion and was a perfect fit.
B008O6CQMC|5|Excellent
B004GCHU06|5|no problems just what i expected. no damage from shipping.
B00KMYYQ5O|2|Product went on as directed. Disappointing product did not hold up against the weather after 2months. Reapplying 6 times a year gets expensive base on price.
B00MTD71BW|5|fit and we loved it
B004XG3R3O|5|it was perfect thank you
B00TZGEFPQ|5|Excellent item....just what I wanted.  I am sure much less than if purchased from a VW dealership.  FAST shipping. I like that.  Will buy again.
B002VVC4TG|5|Another great AC Delco part, you need this when replacing the water pump.  With Youtube, Amazon and a little bit of car knowledge you can replace just about anything.
B00O83MPEO|5|It has white lettering on a clear, transparent background. It affixes to the outside of the window, not protected as it would be if on the inside.
B000BYD9OE|5|I got these as a factory replacement for my 1996 ford crown Victoria with the 4.6L modular motor. I got these cheaper on amazon that autozone with a discount where I work haha. If you like quality motorcraft parts (which you should for your ford products) then these are more affordable than most parts houses would sell them for.!
B009JWEOM0|5|Work great
B00JCE8CI2|4|As advertised. Fits a little weird on my Ducati scrambler but it does the trick. No more launching off the bike in the wind.
B00BW6DKF8|5|Works great, just like the factory installed option.<br />Beware of shoddy installers. My dealer used plastic zip ties to mount the module mounting bracket to the flange under the dash. The kit comes with 3 self tapping screws, but the top one is very hard to install. I guess the others were over the tech's head too, and he installed it with the zip ties. Only problem with this is, it rattles when you travel on some of the many Michigan neglected roads. Insist on a proper installation. Took me 5 minutes to install 2 screws to end the rattle problem.<br />The PCM will need to be flashed by the dealer so the brake bias shows up on the info screen.
B0030UQO0M|2|Let me start off by saying, I'm giving this 2 stars because these flares look great, but that's about it. Had I known before I bought them how poor the manufacturing and how terrible the installation would have been, I never would have bought them. I feel kind of sick that I spent $600+ on these. Matter of fact, I did start a return through Amazon for them after becoming so incredibly frustrated with the quality during install but since I already had 6 hours into the install on just 2 of them, I decided to just stick it out and finish installing them.<br /><br />PROS: Looks good but if you can find something similar elsewhere, do not buy these. In fact, unless you have your heart set on this set of fenders, just stay away.<br /><br />CONS: Where do I begin? The molded plastic pre-drilled hole areas didn't match up to the body holes, I had to do all of the clean up on all of the holes with a razor because all of the pre-drilled areas had massive amounts of left over plastic still attached to them. I understand this happens sometimes with molded plastic products but ALL of the holes needed to be cleaned up! Installation instructions could be considered a book, there are like 50 steps for each fender (THESE ARE DEFINITELY NOT BOLT-ON-AND-GO!). The instructions are a joke, in and of themselves, photocopied black and white pictures so small they're barely decipherable and the text instructions aren't much better. There are YouTube videos (that I watched prior to install) showing and making it look like the process of putting these Fenders on are the easiest thing since slicing softened butter...but even they showed similar issues to what I experience, they just didn't talk about it...wondering if they were paid by Bushwacker to make it look easy. The light assembly was torturous, we tried the suggested &#34;use a couple of socket extensions to put through the body to hold the nut in place while tightening the screw&#34;....LOL! Ended up just wrapping tape to my index finger to stick down inside the body to attach the nut to the screw bolt. Cutting the stock well covers to fit was actually the EASIEST part.<br /><br />All-in-all, I ended up keeping these because I had so much of my precious time invested in installing them (12 hours total) by the time I was realizing all of these issues. They are not coming off and I don't want to return these and end up having to do the same thing over again with another product, ugh.<br /><br />They look good, not worth $600+, but they'll do...ger to stick down inside the body to attach the nut to the screw bolt.

B000F6DNMQ|4|Haven't yet &#34;installed it but think it will do the job.
B005KDOAGC|1|These burn out fast.
B000GV39VK|5|Excelente.
B0010DXYH2|5|Easy install and worth the price.
B00APOA2J0|5|Good looking & very good quality, just as important!  Ordered a second!  (Need 2 plates in NJ).
B00306YYXK|5|Easy to install step by step instructions . Great unit that isolates the vehicle from the trailer lighting .
B00K3GBRQ2|4|As many others have stated, these things are pretty bright compared to what was in there previously for my reverse bulbs. I will update this if the bulbs do not last although I am very pleased with my purchase at the moment.
B00MJFP8VA|1|Don't buy. You can get OEM bolts, all 10, for half the price.    [...]
B000C5FLFC|5|Delivery was fast and part same as you get at any dealership.
B008VPVT0G|4|Everything fits perfect, unless you have a lift on your Jeep (and who doesn't?).  If you have a lift on your Jeep, it might require modification to one of the bracket-pivot points.  My Jeep has a 3&#34; body lift, so I had to get the bracket-pivot part fabricated to extend down so the clutch bellcrank could sit level.  Suspension lifts may not require a modification, but I can't be sure.

B010AIYTX0|1|Got the product in the mail buy it only came with the disk and pressure plate. The flywheel and bears and alignment tool are all miss.. tried to email them..
B00JN0U4SQ|2|Reception sounded worse so never used
B004ZF3TZY|4|Quality materials, well made. Great customer service.
B000C2SBTS|1|Installed in June,  replaced it end of November because it failed.
B00POG2D5U|5|Perfect little accents to the tires
B00D9C2CDO|5|Freed up so much room in the car, easy to put on, take off!  Just be sure to buy a small(ish) lock that will fit through the zippers.  I might not deter the most resolute thief, but it is secure enough with a little deadbolt.
B001KNC11C|3|Plastic tabs where the locks are pop off all the time then backs wont lock. I personally think they over did the Velcro on the bags. Bags falling apart due to constantly fighting the velcro. I dont open them unless i absolutely have too.
B000GZRCVY|5|Really made the 94 Harley motorcycle stand out,  the standard one that was one it was from another era.  Made it look sharp.  Great Product, fast shipping
B00DRZDENK|4|Seems to be good quality- have not had to use it yet.
B0007LVJ2A|1|Used only 2-3 times before the lock cylinder fell out of the housing.  Contacted the manufacturer, Curt, twice to request assistance.  No response.
B00COYNWP0|5|FIT PERFECT ON THE SMALLER BUCKET SEATS
B0009IK5WG|5|I change out windshield wipers annually because the scorching sun degrades them after prolonged exposure. You may get lucky and stretch them out for a couple seasons, but these wipers are very reasonably priced and wipe just as well, if not better, than the more expensive brands that will also degrade from the sun. Installation is very easy. I don't see any need for a higher priced wiper when I can have a fresh pair for half the price. Just my .02 cents, but what do I know.
B001L9ZBZS|4|Make my truck look good
B004UO32KC|5|Much less expensive than those sold by dealer.
B00C25GRI0|5|Same a original OEM unit that failed.  Very pleased with purchase!
B0023VDODO|5|Matches the original tail light perfectly!  Highly recommend.
B004GCKY9A|2|Pain to install and the yellow clips do fall off so find a way to keep them on and it would have more stars.
