B005H0IW6W|5.0|Enjoying this Christmas CD very much because Michael Buble' is so talented. Puts me in the Christmas mood. Would recommend this CD highly..
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have read all of the Harry Bosch novels and although I enjoyed reading The Black Box, I feel that Harry was a bit lack lustre in this one.<br /><br />It's about time Harry made his mind up on the love of his life. He is not a romantic but he has treated some of his lady friends despicably. However if Harry was tied permanently to any one woman I suppose it would be the end of the character as we know him.<br /><br />The intervention of the Internal Affairs investigator in saving him at the end was a bit unconvincing. How did she know where to find him? She displayed pretty amazing skills for a desk jockey.<br /><br />Although Harry appears to have survived to investigate more cases, his revenge on his slimy boss was inconclusive. Nevertheless, I will be lining up for the next Harry Bosch novel, hopefully with Harry back to his old self.<br /><br />Long live Harry Bosch!!!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The first three episodes are good - a little weird.  It keeps my wife and I wanting more.  We just have to find time for viewing during our busy retirement day.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty shades darker is the excellent follow-up to the first book. Can't wait to read<br />The third book in the series now.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The recipes are easy to follow. They make you question sometimes wether it will be good or not. All of the recipes I have tried have been very good. I made my parents some of the dishes from the book they bought a copy.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really liked the first book of the trilogy and have read other books by Ken Follet and like his style.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Great story, but long and a lot of words. It took a while to get to the real story, but it took off from there.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|It was pretty funny overall.  What it really seemed like to me was basically a live action Family Guy movie.  Which was not upsetting at all because as I said, overall it was pretty funny.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have never been a huge fan of the \\"middle\\" book of a trilogy. However, this book truly is essential to the plot of the final book. It eludes to what happens with Katniss, the districts' fate, and the twists and turns of the government.<br /><br />The second book focuses on the Quarter Quell and the fate of the tributes (though predictable). It also puts to light what happens to the Victors and how Peeta and Katniss work in their new roles.<br /><br />Though I felt the book was predictable, I appreciated the twists that the author gave her readers. You'll want to pick up the third book instantly after finishing this one!
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I contacted Amazon via chat and made him sit there with me while the songs downloaded.  All 23 tracks are now included.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm so in love with this book.  Who can honestly say there hasn't been a Travis \\"friend\\" in there life that they haven't fallen for? Whether or not it worked out into a relationship, this story has a connection to most people! Travis is a bad boy who didn't want to settle down but somehow Abby finds her way into his heart.  Although it is rather silly that Abby holds out on Travis for so long ( which made me almost mad at her), all is right at the end.  You will laugh, cry and hold your breath throughout this story!  Hands down my favorite book I have read so far and trust me I read a ton
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Ms Milan certainly knows how to bring characters to life that are vivid and compelling. There was so much to not just Minnie and Robert's story in the present, but what brought them to be the people they were. I appreciate it so much when a writer has their characters TALK. I absolutely loved how in the scene where there could have been the traditional \\"big misunderstanding\\" to keep the couple apart, that one character all but smacked the other upside the head and pretty much stated that it's a part of a relationship for a couple to fight and running away solves nothing. Ms Milan made the main characters so utterly human in the books and it was a wonderful experience for this reader. They loved, argued, and laughed like people do. They were not untouchable paragons but people trying very hard to be the best that they could be.<br /><br />I guess the reason that I gave it only 4 stars had to do with the sensual aspect of the book. It wasn't that it wasn't well-written or that the encounters between Robert and Minnie weren't lovely. My quibble had to do with Minnie's \\"knowledge\\" on things just didn't seem to jive with how sheltered \\"genteel\\" women were back then. It wound up taking me almost completely out of the story because I was just like, \\"huh? how did she know to do that?\\". (I'm talking pre-marriage) I know she had an unconventional upbringing and all, but even given that upbringing, it didn't explain her being in touch that way. I'm sure there were plenty of women like her back then and it's all on me and my preconceived notions of how the women were but there you go.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a whimsical movie about a human that was raised by elves.  There are so many funny lines by Buddy!  My grandchildren love this movie, and we plan on watching it together again this Christmas.  It's a feel good movie, though of course not realistic.
0446554995|5.0|It's rare for me to purchase a book on the day of release--this is one of those few books that I have made a point to do so.<br />I have enjoyed the Pendergast series for years, plus the other books by these authors.  Nice to see Pendergast's back story expanded a bit, and I'm looking forward to more.  I feel that the authors tied up a \\"loose end\\" with Helen and what happened to her...it's one of those tidbits that mentioned in the earlier books, makes you wonder just what happened in Africa all those years ago, and want to know more.<br />The action is nonstop, and there are a few plot twists that I did not see coming.  What held my attention the most was Pendergast's deep despair over his failure (and I'm trying not to reveal any spoilers), and watching him go through his own personal 'walk' through the abyss and then resurface.<br />The various subplots were enjoyable as well--Constance and Dr. Felder, Corrie Swanson...good to see these characters appear again.  I'd like to see Eli Glinn appear in another Pendergast book.<br />All in all, an enjoyable book.  Looking forward to more in the Pendergast series...perhaps more of his history, especially the burning of his family home & the death of his parents in New Orleans.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine's voice would garner practically any album at least 3 stars, but she and her producers went the extra step by eschewing the usual tired song lineup and offering songs like \\"Another Year Has Gone By,\\" \\"The Magic of Christmas Day\\" and Christmas Eve,\\" among others.  With many other CDs, I have to pick and choose to prevent hearing the same songs 50 times in one month, but Celine's delicious voice and her choice of songs make this one a \\"play-it-from-start-to-finish\\" disc every year.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|As always, Liam is perfectly captivating in what he does. Keeps your interest from beginning to end! Love this movie!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|l like it - fills a void left in the original device - I see no need for the upgrade - tells me what i need/want to know.
055357342X|4.0|I maintain that book #3 of any given long book series tends to make or break the series' overall popularity, and this third entry in George R.R. Martin's epic Song of Ice and Fire septilogy is no exception. Martin doubles-down on everything at stake here. \\"Valar Morghulis,\\" it is said or, if translated from High Valyrian, \\"All men must die.\\" As the realm of the Seven Kingdoms bleeds from war, the houses vying for power would do well to remember their mortality. No one is safe.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords is more substantial than its predecessor, A Clash of Kings--significant story arcs intersecting with one another while the plot navigates a number of twists and turns you never see coming. In my opinion, the first book, A Game of Thrones, is still the strongest, but not by much, and Swords would surpass it if it shedded about 300 pages of bloat.<br /><br />Martin has crafted a story of extraordinary complexity, and given the many surprises from this book alone I have only the faintest idea where things are going next.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Considering the past work of these two musicians, I thought I knew what to expect, soundwise.  This is a departure from that expectation, but an excellent one.  It's melodic, it's progressive, it's emotional.  It needs to be played LOUD!!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|exactly as shown, not used yet because its a gift but best price online. it meets my expectations. I would by it again
B000K15VSA|5.0|&#34;Blade Runner&#34; is not a movie to watch lightly.  And one cannot digest this entire set in one sitting.  It would be redundant.  Yet it is such a fascinating movie that is worthy of study.  This edition has just about every cut imaginable, including the &#34;work print&#34;, so the serious fan will have enough to chew on for weeks!  My personal favorite is The Final Cut, though I do reserve a certain fondness for the original theatrical release.  The documentaries and interviews are comprehensive and  well-done.  I cannot praise the thoroughness of this compilation highly enough, though perhaps that may also be the one point I could criticize:  there is an awful lot of material, and not all of it would be of interest to everybody.  I found myself wandering and nodding off at times.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's just about ALL THERE!  For uber-fans, this is a must!  (Though I kind of wish I had the Final Cut on Blu-Ray...)  Don't forget to just enjoy the movie after all of the &#34;study&#34;.  It's a classic for a reason!
B007JNR518|4.0|When I first saw this film, I didn't care for it, but my wife wanted to see it, so I bought it and I'm glad I added it to my library. I really don't know what was wrong with my thinking the first time through, but this time, I found the film to be engaging. Redford's performance was top-notch and he got the most from all the performers.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game it is a lot of fun!! I just hope I do not need to spend money to keep playing
B008JEJPSC|4.0|I'm not sure what movie reviewer Tom Keogh was watching, but his review was way off base. I would give him a thumbs down for his opinion on this film. And, I'm not sure why it took this long for a widescreen release to come to DVD (Stay away from the special anniversary DVD only release -- it is still pan and scan). Both my wife and I loved this film from the moment we saw it in the theater and still love it. Burnett, Finney, and the rest of the cast turn in great performances and while the acting is, well, I'm not sure how to describe it, but it is very much &#34;staged&#34;, it fits with the era and characters.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Too many and too long chaces. Story with no conclusion.<br />Charaxcers weve never seen before. Too much time spent on wondering plot
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My lady friend turned me on to this game. We both have Kindle Fire's and I'm not what you would call a gamer by any means but she had me try it and about a half hour later I get the &#34; Ahem, do you think I could have my Kindle back now?! We both had a good laugh. The expressions on the birds before they explode and the grins on the piggies when they don't is just too funny. This coming from a 56 year old man who as I said earlier is not a gamer. LOL Try it, I dare you, you'll be hooked, line and sinker. Thanks Amazon.
B009LRE040|3.0|Way too many plot holes derailed my enjoyment of the film. There's the part where Blake just happens to run right up to the nearly-drowned Commissioner Gordon. Right in the middle, Miranda Tate is in two different spots at once (with Bane and with Morgan Freeman). Then at the end after the &#34;Bat&#34; had been vaporized by a nuclear bomb, it somehow ended up on a roof again with Lucius Fox examining it. Could have been another Bat, but we were never shown more than one. The thing I really liked about the first two Nolan Batman films was that as fantastical as they were, they maintained a level of believability. The story was tight with few holes. This one just ignored feasibility and time way too much. That being said, even if it was a 1-star movie it would be worth watching once just for Anne Hathaway.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I just love Harry Bosch....such a real character, human, doing his best.  There is always a twist in Connelly's books and The Black Box does not disappoint.  Could not put it down.  Connelly really understands how bureauracy works as he develops the characters in the police department. He also covers the guilts and joys of parenting well too.<br /><br />As a writer, Connelly has flow.  The imagery of his descriptions is just right, not overdone.  The environs of LA come alive.  It's easy to follow the streets and sights.  The crime scenes are described without the pointless graphicness of some writers.  His people are real.<br /><br />Mr Connelly, keep 'em coming!  I'm hooked!
0061992860|5.0|Great little pocket book, definetely a must have in for any outdoors person. Very informative and the illustrations are very simple to follow.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Well, I liked 4 the 1st 40 seconds then it got boring. I guess it wasn't my type of game. All the other teamlava games r gr8! Just not this 1. I like the island part of it. It was beautiful.  I thought the story was ok. But I don't really enjoy dragons that much. But I would recommend u try it. C if u like it. If u don't just uninstall it. If u do,  keep playing.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|Just a war movie my husband wanted to add to our collection. Great movie I would recommend it for anyone.
0061992860|5.0|At 3 1/4\\" by 4 1/2\\" this guide is very small jam packed survival guide, custom made for a BOB (bug out bag). However small it maybe it has 380 pages of absolutely super survival info.  Many, many color pix of edible plants, snakes etc. Everything from camp craft, water, food, knot tying it is all in here. When not in your BOB carry it in your jacket pocket and read it (study it!) during those free moments during the day. This is a book that literally could save your life!
B0086700CM|5.0|Can't get enough of this game. Remains challenging even after unlocking all the powers. Highly recommend this enjoyable game for anyone who likes to keep pushing to beat high scores.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is my first Lee Child book and I like it. well paced and good story line. I will be trying the rest of the series
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Glitchy as hell. Would rather use the mobile website than this. So many facebook features are not available through this app like picture and link sharing. It also frequently mixes and matches my friends profile pics up.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn at his best with his Mitch Rapp  I couldn't put this one down. Some nice twists and turns.  I give it Five stars.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|The game is really good but it's not free. This is only a demo and buying the game resets your progress so if you play the first few minutes and fall in love with the game (like I did) buy it right away.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|One of the saddest movies I ever watched but I was very happy to be able to add it to my dvd collecton
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I love science fiction. This one was another great one to watch. If you like science fiction, you will like this one.
1452110581|3.0|Wasn't as great as I'd expected but it was cute.  I can't really say I'd recommend it unless someone is a huge cat lover.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I love the action in this one. I am a big fan of this kind of action hero type movie.
1401310672|5.0|Started reading it as soon as it came.  I was home alone sitting in my chair laughing out loud over & over again.  Would highly recommend it as a gift or as just a table top book in someone's own home,
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I love this movie and am excited to own it. Thank you Amazon.com, I will enjoy watching it again at a good price to boot.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I've seen him in person & he is fantastic!  His music is never out of style.  I've given his CDs as gifts & they are always received very happily!
B0085776BG|3.0|It had it's moments. Wasn't the best movie of the year. It didn't really do a whole lot for me.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie when it shows up on tv.  I was thrilled to be able to add it to my collection.
0439023491|5.0|This book just continues the amazing story of Katniss and Peeta, the star-crossed lovers. I love it! And I know that anyone that reads it will to!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I love the Tudors. Although its not historical accurate at all its still worth watching as a fiction action-drama tv show.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|I WANTED TO SEE THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND I AM GLAD THAT I DIDN`T IT WAS SO SAD WATCHING EACH ONE OF THEM DIE ONE AT A TIME I HAD NO IDEA IT INVOLVED SUCH  I HAVE SEEN HIS MOVIES AND THIS ONE I PROBABLY WON`T WATCH AGAIN
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has the feel of traditional cinema with new age visual effects woven into a brilliant story with excellent writing and acting that keeps me glued to the TV( or iPad ;) There hasn't been a show since Firefly that's had me this intrigued and genuinely addicted!
B0086900TI|5.0|THE ACTING WAS GREAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE PERHAPS A BIT HEAVY....I HAVE WATCHED IT 2 TIMES. AN I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE TO SEE IT
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|A little heavy-handed on the teen angst bit, but we need to remember that when you get that beat down while playing Halo online, it's probably at the hands of a teen all full of angst.  In other words, I think they did a good job hitting that demographic.  It's just too bad that I am not part of that demographic category.<br /><br />Taking it for what it is though, I thought it was a job well done, and I appreciate the attention to detail and the completion of part of the Halo 4 story that you don't get from the game.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE CLEAR TO THE END I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ENTIRE MOVIE WAS ABOUT..BUT IT ALL CAME TOGETHER I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This extension was just what I needed to keep my otterbox on my iphone4 and attach it to my iPod player without removing the otterbox. Great purchase!!!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is the best show on TV right now. If you don't watch the show, do yourself a favor and buy the DVDs so that you can catch up with all the fans who already know what's up
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love Bones and I missed this season and Netflix doesn't have it and even Hulu plus doesn't since season 8 is on now.  So I had to bite the bullet and shell out the cash.  I'm glad I did as this was very convenient to watch.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|A good effort, but definitely not as good as the Matt Damon Bourne movies. Still entertaining, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend you buying this as a Christmas gift for your friends/family.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great and a real laugh too. I couldn't stop laughing I recommend this it is a quick read and a good one too.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Classic story, love it each time I read it. Highly recommend everyone, especially the ladies to read this story.  The Bronte sisters never wrote a &#34;typical&#34; romance...always a dark side before the light!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook helps me keep in touch with family. I live in Alabama and I have relatives in GA, FL., CA, OH, MI, from east to west and we're able to share pics with each other. I dearly love Facebook.<br />Eloise
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|If you love r&b and amazing singing and beats you need to buy this cd. It is worth the 10$.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|but at least the movie rental cost a whole lot less.  To be fair, I did hatenthe play so why would I rent the movie?  I just had to see Tom Cruise in the role of the old rocker.
B004LWZW7O|2.0|In my search for Blu Ray movies, I remember seeing the preview for this in the theater and thinking it looked interesting.<br /><br />However, this movie pulled off a trifecta for me:<br /><br />Forced acting, film-school level directing and a bad script.<br /><br />All that adds up to a bad movie.<br /><br />I found it hard to keep my focus on the movie, wanting easily to walk away from it.<br />In other words, it wasn't compelling to watch.<br /><br />I really don't understand any talk about this movie becoming a \\"cult classic\\".<br />Like what? Robocop?  Mad Max? Water World?<br />I don't think so.<br />I could never see myself or anyone watching this 20 years from know and saying...\\"that was so cool\\"<br /><br />If you must see it, pick it up  as a used DVD or stream it.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Dont to it.  Even if it is free, I am sure you could find better things to do with your time.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love mystery games but I don't use volume or sound when I play so I don't know if this has sound or not. The thing that I liked the most on this is the fact that they have a map that tells you where things are and where there are things that need to be completed along with actual true hints. I have found another one that the hints are minimal - I want hints and this one is great. I want more like this one
0441013597|4.0|One of the best book I have ever read. Its power and imagination rivals that of Lord of the Rings; Dune has so many nuances, so much emotion, so many small details, it is absolutely brilliant. You will continue to think back on it for days after finishing it. I can't believe I hadn't read it sooner. An absolute must for readers interested in sci fi and/or classics.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this one, just wish it would have had a map. It was fun but not memorable. I will keep it on my Kindle to play again another time
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I got this as a gift to give to another person but once it arrived, I couldn't part with it and had to buy that person something else. This box set is so gorgeous and makes a great item to add to my collection (already have Dances with Wolves and Schindlers List). Inside was a music box, post cards from the cast while they were shooting, a book about the real family and the cast and how the movie came to be. There was also a 4 disc box set to enjoy watching the movie again and again on our new blu ray player. I was able to share this musical with my kids (ages 3 and 5) and they were so into it the whole time. I love this item and hope everyone gets a chance to add it to their collection!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like having access to Facebook, but I'm so disappointed that I can't play my Facebook games on my Kindle.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My husband absolutely loves this show - so I have been buying him every single season as they come out.  It's hilarious...plus it's really fun to watch the characters evolve from season to season.
B003EY9UZU|1.0|This movie was terrible in almost every way imaginable.  Cliches abound along with a complete lack of any accurate science.  I can tolerate some artistic liberties but even an idiot would know this doesn't make sense. It made my brain hurt.  I may have permanent damage.
B000KN7BIQ|4.0|But wouldn't work in my DVD player so I had to return it and ordered another one that wasn't HD which worked just fine. The thing is my DVD player says HD on it so I don't know why it wouldn't work. Seller was fast to refund me.
B004OYCV2I|3.0|I played this for the first time and th title track skips. Amazon graciously replaced it and the replacement skips on the exact same parts. Needless to say, there is a kink in the production of this album. I have all of the other Prince 180 Gram Vinyl albums and they do not have this issue. It is unfortunate because Controversy is my favorite track. It's nice that they include the poster that came in the original release.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am glad that I found this at a lower price. I am also glad that it was new. Although the CD holder inside was damaged and the holder wasn't connected to the DVD spine is the only downside. Besides that great buy and great price!
0316287059|5.0|I have one other book by him and love it and this was just as good a must have for and one doing makeup.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|I was unsure about this box set at first due to its price. It's now my favorite of the box sets so far. Lots and lots of good songs and good alternative versions of existing songs. Well worth the price in my opinion!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this looked like a mindless fun game until you get sucked in. very deceptive for us educated adults. indeed it has become additive. I tell my husband I'm reading. like I say. addictive. indeed
B008G3N71W|5.0|Greta May is stuck in life as an unemployed 19-year old actress. A handsome, charismatic stranger gives her his number on the London Tube - Richard. Greta makes up her mind to call and goes to see him. It's something most of us wouldn't do, but Richard's caught her at a low point and Greta is egged on by her sexy stripper roommate. The tension is nicely set up at the beginning of this erotic quest novel - what will happen next? What sexual boundaries will she explore and break?<br /><br />Chloe Thurlow's prose is heady and fizzy like champagne. She writes like an angel. A very dirty one with an imagination that is clearly influenced by the writings of the pioneer of modern sexual transgression, the Marquis de Sade. Her characters are delicious, especially Greta, the hot 19-year old actress who revels in losing her sexual inhibitions. This is no-holds-barred erotica, a unique combination of sensual and highly explicit debauchery.<br /><br />Thurlow's characters are hungry for sexual ecstasies and plunge into it. Richard is dominant, a British Christian Grey, and Greta enjoys submitting to his lustful vision, discipline and requirements to display her nudity and sexual performance. This novel is a naughty indulgence and in its last third managed to become quite shocking.  Not for the faint of  heart as some situations are quite extreme, particularly towards the end, where the action reminded me a bit of the unrealistic, naughty fairytale quality of A. N. Roquelaire's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" trilogy. Highly recommended and I will be reading more of Miss Thurlow's work!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I am really disappointed that after spending over $200 for the Kindle I had to purchase the hd camera.  It should be a free app.  Also, disappointed that it is not a two way camera.  Should have spent the extra money and bought an ipad.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a a very good book until the last few chapters. It was as if the author got tired of writing and just gave up.
8866131059|5.0|This Daily Planner is precisely what I needed to record my daily eating activities. I have been recording what I eat, what time I eat it and how much I eat. I also record what medication i take, what time I take it and how much I take. I record other pertinent information regarding my health. It is the right size (fits in my pocket) and is substantial enough to stand up under very frequent use. I have used other Planners in the past but this is far superior to any others I have used in the past.This is my third year to use the Moleskine 12 month daily planner. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who records daily activities. It is by far the best quality planner I have used.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Very happy with the handling of my purchase. Received the item faster than expected. Better then standing in holiday lines for hours just to purchase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was erotic in its dialogue and amazing in its human depth.  It was about human weakness strength and emotion.  I loved it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this puzzle is so relaxing and calming.  it has wonderful art work.  and is easy to maunever the pieces around
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Oh wow.. I've lost sleep over this book. I loved it.. and hated it.. enjoy it, as I did.  Winter is coming.
B000T433CO|5.0|I love this story, as well as all of the actors in this movie.  It is just a movie that leaves you feeling so good about the world around us.
0525952926|5.0|I have read both books of this trilogy and am patiently waiting for the third.  This second book covered my generation and I learned some new things about the events leading up to WW II.  Follett does his homework well to weave history into his novels.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great Christmas story. This movie takes you back to a time when life was slower and times were easier. Like it!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I was really disappointed in this movie. While Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones give great performances, the script itself was awful.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|The Christmas season begins for me with watching this movie on Thanksgiving weekend.  It is a beautiful story of hope and love.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Just ok. I think I expected too much. I will pass on book 2 /3. I plan to search the internet for unanswered questions.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend it. It is a great book especially if you have kids in middle school. It might teach them to accept kids that are different.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I buy all of the Harry Bosch books.  This one is as exceptional as the previous ones.  Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed it, but not his best, by far.  I normally can't put his books down, this one I could.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|at first I didn't know how to get out of it the I did and this gamehas bugs and SO that's why I uninstalled it :(
1408803011|5.0|This book's title explains the general content of the book. It makes you wish there were pictures and gets you look at things differently.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|This series was ok. It seemed to get of to a really slow start, but picked up towards the end. The characters, action, story seem very promising. I am looking forward to the next series.
B009VL299E|2.0|The guitars are in a weird tone for the older far superior songs that make them sound way less powerful and epic as they did.  James vocals are atrocious to say the least. The set list isn't bad but there is far to much death craptastic on it...I actually think they play the whole album.  I am not one of the Metallica fans who will buy everything and praise it becasue it has the word \\"Metallica\\" on it.  I praise them when they release quality music/live shows which hasen't been for 20+ years now and I speak my mind when they release garbage like Load, Re-load, Lulu, DM or St. S%*&.  This DVD is inferior to the mexico live dvd set and seems like a pointless cash grab release that is just a copy/paste of every live death craptastic concert.  I gave up a long time ago being excited for anything from this band.  Hopefully their next album will have the real Hetfild singing, no mind numbing kindergarden lyrics, good riffs, some improved drums and some actual inspiration/effort.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Movie is well done, but it deviates from the original text.  Makes for a good comparison/contrast essay for students.  No way students can master an examination from exchanging the movie for the written text!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|~ PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST BEFORE DECIDING IF YOU'D LIKE TO PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER; VERY IMPORTANT... (AND THE BEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD WITH ANY SELLER OVER THE INTERNET!) ~<br />  I received this item about a WEEK before expected or posted, which was great. When I first watched it, it skipped a few chapters... so, at first I was not happy. I didn't want to return the movie, due to the fact that the return shipping would cost as much as I paid for it. So ~ I thought I would be stuck with a defective dvd.<br />  **However, when I contacted the seller, and explained what happened; (that it looked perfect, and would still skip despite cleaning and trying other dvd players,)<br />  The seller contacted me immediately, apologized, and informed me that they had ALREADY sent me a new dvd when they received my message, and not to worry about trying to return the previous skipping dvd, that they understood my predicament.<br />  I would DEFINATELY recommend this seller (and dvd) to anyone and everyone I know. You can't beat the service, a lot of sellers would be more worried about the money and not the customer, and would want the item back before anything else was done. I LOVE IT! And just received the new dvd yesterday as promised.<br />  ~* Thanks again for understanding guys!! *~  :-)<br />  VERY happy about this experience, and they have more than proven to be trustworthy. I look forward to doing business with them again in the near future.
0062073486|5.0|Christie's clues are subtle, but it all come together nicely in the end. I was not really surprised by &#34;who - dunnit&#34; - just surprised that the villian knew these &#34;strangers&#34; so well.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|You can tell this is a work of love from a very strong vocalist with a distinct tone, but for me his voice works better with the lighthearted stuff, but then, I like more upbeat material. Fortunately he's great at that when he does it. I just feel Christmas is a time for celebration, than remorse.
B000002C2E|5.0|2012-12-13
B00AHXDECG|5.0|i enjoy listening to the whole cd all day. the ballads specially are awesome. if you like bruno previous music, you won't be disappointed
B009QW7YEI|5.0|I think this is a really underrated Bond movie. I remember seeing it for the first time in 1997 with my dad in theaters. I loved it then, and I love it now. The action, the score, the emotions, the feels, everything, it's just great. I should also mention that Pierce Brosnan is my favorite Bond, and probably always ever will be, seeing as how I grew up watching him as Bond.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Its not just about cooking.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interesting in learning a new skill, reading about the adventures of T. Ferriss or just to get a few quick tips in the kitchen.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Product arrived in like new condition as described. Plays flawlessly. Pretty good movie too if your into this sort of thing(i.e. thug  brawler/ prison tales).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It keeps my children amused and is easy for them to understand, even gives me something to do while waiting at appts!
0893860468|2.0|Good book I think just waaay to bloody expensive! There are / were many more sage's that have just as good book's that don't cost nearly 30$.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a quick sweet read. I loved the overall message to cherish our time with our loved ones. The characters were relatable and the story didn't drag. The ending wrapped up nicely.
081297381X|2.0|Thought it was a book on life choices from a mystical,bhuddist, spiritual type of sense.Bunch of arrogant stock market mumbo jumbo.
B005K17RU0|3.0|ok app. use it on my kindle fire. there is a 13 word minimum and it seems I had to leave a comment
B002OHB3CG|4.0|If you're hoping that it'll be on par with Alice in Chains' or Nirvana's MTV Unplugged, you might want to curb your enthusiasm just a tiny bit. That having been said, this album has some really cool, stripped-down versions from the Dutch melodic metal band's catalog.<br /><br />You still get some higher energy ones like &#34;What Have You Done Now?&#34; but a lot of them are slower songs that are more suited to the acoustic genre. At the end, the bonus track &#34;Utopia&#34; is just brilliant. I'd say that song alone is worth buying the album for.<br /><br />So if you can soothe your inner, savage, metal-loving beast long enough to embrace some alternative versions of some of your favorite Within Temptation songs, this is a great record. But if you're expecting it to be a definitive collection of their very best stuff done acoustically, you might be a tad disappointed. However, I would insist that this is a must-have for any fan of Within Temptation's music.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I read Wettest County in the World a while back and I was very excited to learn about this movie. There are a lot of key plot points that are different to keep the movie going, but I enjoyed it.
B003L77GRO|4.0|So after the events of season 4, which shall remain undiscussed here, Dexter and you, the viewer, are left picking up the pieces. What happens next? How does Dexter manage? As good as the show is, your typical Dexter fare only carries you so far without a compelling storyline like seasons 1-4 had. If I were to compare it to college football, this season would be a &#34;rebuilding season&#34; rather than a &#34;championship season.&#34; Julia Stiles is a decent guest star and makes an interesting companion for Dexter. However, the over-arching villain in Season 5 is somewhat vanilla compared to previous seasons. But fear not, Dexter's saga improves, in my humble opinion, in later seasons. So watch it for plot points, but don't expect another Trinity Killer, Bay Harbor Butcher or Ice Truck Killer storyline.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Hard to put down. At one point I laughed. Other times it  was hard not to cry.  Heart breaking. I highly recommend  this. Will see  the movie and cry.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|The movie itself is one of Marvel's best. Thor provides an excellent segue into The Avengers. Hemsworth makes for a believable Thor. Streaming this via Amazon is pretty good, although quality can vary based on your connection.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My 4 year old niece loves this movie! She watches it over and over again. It's a great family film that
B009329ZF2|5.0|Loved the non stop intense action! Enjoyed seeing the employment of military veterans. Whether they were actual vets or not, it was a nice touch.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this series for my father's birthday - he was enthralled with it.  It was suggested to my by my brother-in-law and it was definitely worth the money.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I really loved the movie with Will Smith, but this book (as all books usually do) blew it away!  i loved the twists and each step Robert took especially psychologically.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I only liked 1 song in the entire CD. I was very disappointed. I will go to the store & listen to the cd before I get another one.
B001E45XT4|5.0|One of the best bangs for your buck!<br /><br />Don't expect Sennheiser or AKG top of the line sound quality, but expect very good and crisp sound quality specially on the mids and highs. Doesn't seem specially bassy.<br /><br />The Mic is just amazing, I've never used it in front of my mouth because it picks my voice almost at rest position. used it on Skype, Ventrilo and Team Speak with comments on how good an clear my voice is.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|With the star power listed on this movie you would expect a lot more, a letdown especially in the comedic department. This was a really slow moving uneventful movie; save your money watch this one on Netflix.
0061122416|5.0|I had heard about the book on a TV show and I thought it was worth buying.I am not a great reader and I have never finished reading a book completely but this book I could not put down untill Ihad completely read it from cover to cover..It has changed  my way of thinking altogether Paulo is a great writer. It really had me mesmerized and I would say it is the best book I have ever picked up and read. Thanks Paulo. Love and Light.  Andy.
B009VB97EY|3.0|All dance scenes were amazing. Story line was cheesy and not believable. Overall good movie to see with your girlfriends.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|As a fan of good writing and good stories, with my fave authors being Orson Scott Card, Heinlen, Sagan, Elmore Leonard, and the new Patrick Rothfuss, this novel is easily the best I've read in too long of a time. He writes about people like Card, giving you well rounded and full characters, and moves a story on like Leonard, with no frills or excesses.  Truly every sentence develops plot and individual character and keeps the story at a very consistent pace.  It's a thousand pages, and I went through it like it was nothing because I just couldn't put it down. Every page was full of splendor. This world or universe is unbelievably well crafted, and all the details he includes do not ever feel erroneous, as the world they're in is as much a part of the story as the actions. After reading this, I went back and read His Mistborn trilogy, and was excited to find that while it is fantastic, it is not as good as this new series promises to be - this, to me, is a blessing, as it shows that Sanderson is growing and maturing as an author, so the future books will reflect that. I must give compliment to his editor as well for realizing, as I did,  that every sentence was necessary and instrumental in telling this epic.  So go read it guys, you can thank me later.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I Love this app. It's easy to play with no glitches.  Fun for all ages.  If you need something new give it a try!
B004LWZW42|5.0|I may like this 1 better than the originals. It has an excellent cast, and while I've never read comic books, it seems to do a good job linking the origins of some of the xmen to the original trilogy.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|This CD Gaga seems to use up of her talent and more common songs than the others. I do like 2-3 songs. But most of the are not exciting. The previous works are much better.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I like to read a lot and I usually have difficulties in finding average good books to read. This was a book I stumbled upon and I didn't think I would like it. Either way, after I had read the summary plot, I decided to buy it. The book started to get my attention from the very beginning and it continued to get it throughout all the reading. The character development was impressive, the plots were always intriguing and the conclusion of the book was excellent.I would recommend this book to all readers that love a great reading of sword-fights etc.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book, however I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, and I found the movie more enjoyable, which is most unusual to say the least.  There were many differences, i.e., Robert DiNero in the book was anything but nice, and the movie depicted him as the opposite.  The messages to Nikki were delivered entirely different in the movie from the book.  I could state more instances, so in light of these differences they were both worth seeing and reading, but again, I enjoyed the movie more.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This variety of synergistic relationship of phone/gui/audio/video is very cool and this variety of play can be a wonderful outlet. Gets a cool groove, easy to use, and visually interesting.
0812984412|5.0|I ordered the book after having seen the movie, once I realized the author had also written Black Swan Green, which I loved.  So glad I did - the stories make a much nicer whole arranged the way they were written, nested perfectly inside each other, and the writing is simply delightful.  Each story has a distinct flavor, and that's much more easily enjoyed in the reading than in the viewing.
B006QNDDHW|3.0|This book not properly formatted for Kindle/iPad reading. It is a good book! Just bad e-reader experience. If you want it ... get the paper version. The book has a beautiful layout! I understand that that this layout does not easily translate to e-reader. Get the paper version ... seriously.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|In another universe Abe Lincoln (played by Benjamin Walker in adult form) lives in a world in which vampires exist and feed on slaves so that less people know of their existence. What's a lad from those times to do but seek out a vampire hunter who will train him? And so the adventure begins.<br /><br />The tale weaves in History with the mythology of this alternate world and sometimes the ideas are half clever but overall it feels average when it really could have been an awesome experience.<br /><br />Also starring Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />It's high in most areas except character and story. The latter don't stand out much for me and were pretty basic. Dominic Cooper probably did the best overall acting as the vampire hunter mentor.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $69M and it made a bit over $116M at the Box Office (Wiki). It's based on a 2010 novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B plus; MYTHOLOGY MEETS HISTORY: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B008K6DU4Y|3.0|Plays a bunch of formats, but beware the hit to your battery life. It really chews though the battery playing files that it apparently can't use hardware acceleration on the Kindle Fire to decode. You are better off re-encoding the video to h264 and playing it with the Fire's built-in video playing app.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is back.  He had gotten a little soft in the last book but he is back in full force
B005NA3B8U|5.0|Excellent, one of my favorite games of all time come to life on my phone!  It's amazing just how robotic I used to be at this game.  This adaptation is highly faithful, and the controls are pretty intuitive. If you like creative side scrolling pilot games, then this is for you. Creative sprites, interesting concept, and Easter Island Moai.  Just be ready for intensity.
0321857895|5.0|I've been a doodler my whole life, but had never given much thought to using them for something more than keeping my mind busy while in a meeting.<br /><br />This book is informative and inspiring all at the same time. Anyone who reads it is going to put it down and want to buy a new notebook and pen and start drawing right away.<br /><br />I love how the thoughts are direct and stick with you. The entire book IS a Sketchnote so you can't help but be impressed with it the moment you open it up.<br /><br />You'll read this book in no time, but you'll be earmarking it and going back to read it again and grab tidbits for years to come.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book kept me up late reading. I never wanted to stop and just had to keep reading. After reading the Game of Thrones series I just wasn't finding any books that truly captured me, until now.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the music, cars and attitude. Stories are fun. Great weekly escape and not having to watch commercials is key!
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I needed to come up with  a printing solution for the Kindle Fire and this is it. It seems to be related to the Linux CUPS printing system as it supports many printers out of the box. If you're printer isn't specifically listed, you might try another from the same manufacturer that is similar as the printing protocol is often the same. Make sure your printer is visible on the network before installing this or adding the printer to save yourself some frustration. I connected an Epson wireless inkjet printer to it and it seems to work well enough although it can take a while before the printer actually prints the document.
0545128285|3.0|This is for harry potter fans. Not mush interesting new tale.  If you are looking for adventure or swords and battles avoid this book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is my favorite book.  The story tells of a shameful time in American History but the characters bring hope and life and fun.  This book is very well written and captures your heart from the very beginning.  I LOVE IT!
1423136802|5.0|Youngsters need encouragement to read, and also to learn about the stories that influenced our culture. Riordan's books provide this encouragement in spades. In their beautiful interweaving of modern trials and ancient themes,<br />they are a good read for all ages. Deep inside each of us, no matter how old we are, is that youngster unsure of himself or herself facing challenges not fully comprehended.  A good companion for these books is \\"Gods and Other Odd Creatures\\" by Rose Williams, which tells in light-hearted English these stories as they were presented by the Roman Ovid and the Greek Pausanias.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I highly recommend it to everyone!  In Blu-Ray, it is even more amazing
034580404X|5.0|I really loved this book I started a book club on this book. I also recommend this book to every one who loves reading as much as I do.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|When friends or family call me to help them set up a wireless network in their home, I bring my tablet along with this application installed.  At a glance you can tell which wireless frequencies are the least cluttered so as to minimize the amount of time that you spend bashing your head against a wall trying to figure out why computers on the other side of the room cannot connect to the access point.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Compare with FLAC through LINN DS(Klimax), Vinyl makes richer and warmer sound. And it's very smooth. Off course, I have CDs remastered. Vinyl is the best sound. So this box is worth to have if you had a record player.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The fact that this series has mesmerized the populace of several nations should say it all. The imbedded history lessons are fascinating to learn. It is not at all superficial or silly, but seriously entertaining.
1461118778|1.0|Darwin never wrote a book titled 'The origin of the species'. His book<br />was published under two titles: 'The origin of species', and 'On the origin of<br />species'. Both also had subtitles. The term `the species' has sometimes been<br />used by creationists as a synonym for `human beings', and they incorrectly<br />refer to Darwin's book as `The origin of the species', implying that it is<br />about the origin of humans. Of course, it is not. It is about the origin of<br />species - duh. Publishing a book with this incorrect title helps support the creationists' misrepresentation of Darwin. Amazon should not sell this book unless the<br />title is corrected.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I'm very happy with this app,  my battery will always be charged and ready to go, I give this Apps 5 stars. Highly recommended. Thank you!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's simple and fun, but not a game that you have to devote your entire attention to.  I like that it's not timed.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Just what this country needs... something else to waste time on.  This is one of those games that can become terribly addictive especially when you find yourself stuck on a particular level trying to find that one magic trajectory that will bring the whole house of cards down.  The hours that you spend on this game will simply melt away.  It will be as if you had never lived them at all.  Probably the worst part is that even if you get good at this game, no one will care.
B0086UXYZO|5.0|If you just want raucous music with an underlying melody and sharp lyrics, its The Vaccines.  A nice follow up from their first album.  Enjoy!
B008M36ER0|4.0|You just have to love the justice system around the world.  And how you have to pay for your time.  Loved seeing how this is done in Mexico.  Liked the film a lot.  Pop the corn...enjoy the show!
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White's new album, \\"Blunderbuss\\", has to be one of the most creative, well-produced, well-played and uniquely excellent albums I have experienced in years. It is a revelation!  Jack has never written such melodic songs (as far as I am concerned) in his entire career. \\"Blunderbuss\\" begs definition. It is simply full of sublime vitality and beauty!<br />Jack has eschewed his normally overpowering guitarman-ship to give way to a record full of exquisite piano and organ, strange bass and drum intros, pastoral acoustic guitars and wonderful vocals on the entire CD.  And yet, there are still great solos by Jack on his electric guitar, but not a note more or less than should be there.<br />Truthfully, there is not a moment of boredom on the disc!  My only criticism is that I wish it was a lot longer as I find it impossible to stop being entranced by the songs, musicianship and sheer creativity in the production of a record that somehow reminds me of the artistry of, 'The Beatles'. I simply cannot say more than that. There is no doubt, in my mind, that with this solo album, Jack White has demonstrated to the world that he is destined to be one of the greatest musicians of our time!
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|great movie bad HD quality. May be my internet conection. I am the only one online so I would think with the best latest protocol cables and devices and equipment for 2012 that I should get a good streaming rate. dowload measures at 27 Mbps Upload around 4.7Mbps.
B00338QENI|5.0|Sent a sample to my Kindle and absolutely fell in love with this book. Fascinating story, well told and well researched.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Watching it on HD makes it even better! After more than 10 times watching this series, this bluray release makes everything clearer, funier and more enjoyable.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a big DeMille fan.  I love the East Coast, wise cracking, John Corey character.  Lion's Game, the prequel, is a must to read, too.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like how this case fits the Kindle Fire. It has a strap on the back to put your hand through, but I never use it. The cover will fold back and convert into a stand. I think it could use a bit of tweaking though, the groove in which the cover fits into could be a bit deeper. This may impprove as the cover is used a bit more and broken in. Another reason I went with this case was the price. There are really nice cases, but you're gonna pay quite a bit more for them. For the money, this is exactly what I wanted. I would recommend this case.
1423165691|5.0|this is a gift. and i know she will love it! so excited to have found this item. Thank you!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I am not normally into fiction but my daughter downloaded the first book in the series & I can't stop reading... Many unforseen twists & turns...VERY well written...
0061906220|5.0|Unfortunately when this book arrived at the trend kids house from Amazon, the thing was printed backwards, and upside down!!  They thought it was funny.....I didn't.  In the old days these were called &#34;rejects&#34; and never made it past the printers - much less to distributors!  Can we get a &#34;regular&#34; one?
B005I6EU48|5.0|I wanted a cover for my brand new Kindle Fire. I LOVE paper books, and really wanted to still have the same feel/appearance when I had it laying out. This is the perfect solution. I get compliments on it alll the time. I bought another one for my childhood friend, and she adores it as well. :)
0321885112|5.0|If you enjoy Mike Rohde's work, this is the best example yet. Not only does he share his techniques and process for creating beautiful visual notes, but he also designed the entire book. From the writing to design to the custom fonts based on his handwriting this book is the ultimate showcase of Mike's humor, personality and style. I love the rare book that is both written and designed by it's author.<br /><br />It's a fun read and just gorgeous to browse. I'd definitely recommend picking up the physical book instead of a digital version - it's that nice.<br /><br />Even if you don't plan to become a Sketchnoter, there is something to learn and appreciate for any designer or artist.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I just started using this app on my Kindle Fire and I'm surprised at how much info is available to you. Granted the layout is a bit different than the desktop version, but it still offers a lot of info. I used it to look at a couple specific items and it was really easy to use. If your a die-hard ebayer, this is a great app. I would recommend it.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game is alright. its very choppy and it lags a lot. I feel like people rated the game from their experience with the iphone/itouch and not from their experience with the kindle fire. please fix the lagginess. other than that its a good game.
B002LFVE4I|3.0|Very slow, does not develop characters well.  Hard to tell who is doing what to whom.  Not really that interesting.  Certainly not as good as the writer's other work, Downton Abbey.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game. I downloaded it on my phone and it works great. I love it and it works great
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game I enjoy playing it I really like the battles and its simple enough for my son to play to<br />I do wish it wld give more energy without having to buy it
B00125WAWS|3.0|Nominated for Golden Globe and starring two Oscar winners, \\"The Great Debaters\\" should have been more widely known, but somehow I missed the film when it was released about five years ago. Now I've seen the film, and I'm still trying to like the film. Acting is top-notch. The photography (Philippe Rousselot, \\"A River Runs Through it\\") is wonderful. The film also deals with a real-life story that is intriguing: all Afro-American debate team in the American South during the 1930s. But something is not quite right, something about the way it is told.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, an English and speech teacher at Wiley College, later known also as a poet and politician. He forms a debate team, with the team members Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams) and a 14-year-old James L. Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), who went on to become a civil rights activist.<br /><br />This is Denzel Washington's second effort as a director. His storytelling is slick and confident. Sure, some of the subplots are conventional and not very interesting to me (Henry and Samantha's love affair, for instance), but with fleshed-out characters they are not that bad. The father-son conflict between Dr. James Farmer Sr. (Forest Whitaker) and James looks pretty familiar, but it is convincing.<br /><br />But somehow it seems \\"The Great Debaters\\" is not really interested in the topic about which it is supposed to tell: debates. The debate scenes are heated and uplifting, thanks to the great performances of the young cast, but the speeches themselves are sometimes too polished (some of them written by Washington's Tolson, an aspect that is not fully explored in the film). How did the students learn the skills?<br /><br />Of course, the film is not just about debating; it is also about the history, or a greater narrative context within which the story is told. Still, I think these likable and credible characters played by talented young players (Denzel Whitaker is just amazing), \\"The Great Debaters\\" could have been much better with more emphasis on the debates.
B009IQG5LK|3.0|\\"Dick Tracy,\\" starring and directed by Warren Beatty, is a live-action comic strip, bringing to life the square-jawed detective created for the funny papers by Chester Gould.  The movie has eye-popping primary colors, grotesque looking villains, the Academy Award-winning Stephen Sondheim song, \\"Sooner or Later,\\" lots of stylized action, and Madonna as torch singer Breathless Mahoney.  The production design looks like a blend of shadowy 40's film noir and MGM Technicolor musical.  Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, and William Forsythe portray bizarre looking baddies.<br /><br />Beatty's Tracy is surprisingly bland, considering the assortment of bad guys he's up against.  He saunters, unflappable, through the movie, looking dashing in an garish banana-yellow trench coat.  The plot is fairly routine, but it's the style that is the picture's real star.  Pacino, in one of the most over-the-top performances of his career, was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.<br /><br />The only bonus extra on the two-disc Blu-ray restored edition is a digital copy of the film.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This book was teriffic.  Once you finished you wish that it never ended.  I highly recomend reading this book.<br />Worth the money.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I found Harry Bosch racing to solve a case that he had encountered 20 years previously during the L.A. Riots.  This case obviously remained in the back of his mind throughout his career, and he needed to see it through to the end.  The thing is that higher ups in the Department want something else.<br /><br />See the events unfold as you read this riveting edition to the Harry Bosch story.  I know that it was very tough to put this story down for any amount of time...  Keep reading to see if you can determine who the real villian is before getting to the end!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very app friendly and has many features.  Very easy to read and understand.  Use it every day a couple of times a day.
0425263916|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I'm on the edge of my seat and will be until the next book comes out.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gary Oldman isn't Alec Guiness, but he makes the role of George Smiley his own.  This is a superb retelling of a classic cold war story, with impeccable casting and a well-oiled plot unspooling from the cameras of a master.  Highly recommended.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Switching stars in a profitable movie sequel is risky business.  It can make for disaster (\\"Grease 2\\") or yield surprisingly good results (\\"Batman Begins\\").  That's the challenge faced by \\"The Bourne Legacy,\\" the fourth in the Bourne series and the first starring Jeremy Renner (\\"The Hurt Locker\\").<br /><br />The previous Bourne movie, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" released in 2007, starred Matt Damon, who created the role on screen.  When Damon and director Paul Greengrass decided to take some time off from the series, Universal faced the same problem Columbia did with Spider-Man:  how do you keep a lucrative franchise alive without the star and the director who made it a success?  A lot was at stake; the first three Bourne pictures had earned nearly a billion dollars worldwide.<br /><br />Rather than have a new actor assume the role, the production created an entirely new covert government-trained assassin:  Aaron Cross.  Several actors were considered, among them Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire, Garrett Hedlund, Michael Fassbender, Alex Pettyfer, Kellen Lutz, Josh Hartnett, Paul Dano, and Michael Pitt.  After a long series of auditions, Renner won the role.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" isn't, therefore, technically a sequel.  Call it a spinoff, with a new protagonist and new-to-the-franchise director Tony Gilroy expanding the saga created by Robert Ludlum.  Cross faces life-or-death stakes triggered by events of the first three films.  Also new to the series are Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz, Stacy Keach, and Oscar Isaac.  Franchise veterans Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn reprise their roles from the earlier films.<br /><br />Special features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, feature commentary with the creative team, digital copy, and deleted scenes.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My husband and I bought the 2011 Lego Advent calendar last year and loved it.  We searched all over town for this year's, but couldn't find it. We were thrilled to find it on Amazon.  The pieces seem to fit together thematically a little better this year. We're having a blast with it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|If Miss Flynn had put as much thought into the end of her book as she did the first 82.6%, it would have been one of the best books of our generation. As it was left, it's very \\"meh.\\" And disappointing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very useful and helpful. It has many screens for different purposes.  You can use this anywhere just put in your location.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A great read that keeps you interested thru out.  Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and all his books have been enjoyed.<br />Be sure to get The Innocent
B004N66XYE|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this new take on what was one of my favorite TV series of all time.  The characters were beautifully drawn, and the plot(s) of each episode made me remember just why the original UD was so wonderful.  I miss Mr. Hudson, but there are compensations, and every episode is a little gem.  I just wish I could count on years and years of new episodes.  In the USA we don't have any idea how to make this kind of TV, more's the pity.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|It said new and wasn't a lie. I have bought things that said brand new and it be busted on top or partcially open. This was actually new no damage at all plus i love the movie.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This is such a good product I may trade it in to get the v2 with slope edition model.<br /><br />My observations:<br /><br />1. If you think the batteries are to costly and you change them too often, buy a pair of rechargeable and recharger on ebay. They cost less than $20.<br /><br />2. I also have a callaway upro mx. But it doesn't alway get a good signal or any signal at some course located in the mountains (I live in El Dorado Hills east of Sacramento and golf at courses in the mountains where the signal is very weak (don't know why). You may not think you need one of you have a gps unit, but you may travel and golf at a course where there isn't a good signal. That's why I got this rangefinder.<br /><br />3. For those of you who aren't sure about whether or not you are hitting the right target (tree, large rock, etc), I have found that having a yardage book helps if you aren't familiar with the course, you can have a rough idea of the approximate yardage and know if what you are scanning is the object you really want to scan.<br /><br />4. Learn how to use the automatic scan feature if you are not sure what you are scanning. The changes in distance as you scan back and forth over different objects will be obvious in identifying the object you are scanning, especially for objects which are 200+ yards away. As you scan back and forth the closest distances will be the objects you know are closest to you. You can then easily determine which object you are scanning if they are further than the closest objects scanned.<br /><br />5. If you don't have steady hands stand in the edge of the cart and brace your arm against the roof of of the cart if you are driving. If you are walking kneel and brace your elbow on the top of your stand bag. If you really need a stand buy an inexpensive expandable camera tripod. They are light, cheap and if you buy one with thin aluminum legs you don't have collapse it, just slide it into your umbrella holder on your bag. Fast to open andfast to put away.<br /><br />6. If you have a yardage book study it as you approach each tee box. You have time to know what you want to scan without slowing your group down. If you don't have one stop at the yardage signs at each tee box. If you need time to determine what you want to scan tee off last.<br /><br />7. For longer distances use the 100/150/200 yard markers (colored posts along the cart paths to your advantage). If you scan them first You will have an approximate idea about the distances to the object you want to scan and it will help you speed up your scans (help you since you know if you are outside 200 yards, between 150 and 200, between 100 an 150).<br /><br />8. If you are off your fairway and can't see what you want to scan, look for a tall object near where you want to hit too and go back to your ball and scan the tall object. You may not get an exact yardage but its better than guessing and can keep you out of hazard areas or worse.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great! It was a movie I just could not walk away from :). I highly recommend it to anyone who likes chick flicks!
B0091LS07E|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more I hear different things in each song that cause me to love it more and more. Alicia's voice is raspy in some songs, but that has always been the case. This is what makes her voice distinctive along with the amount of emotion her music is able to elicit from the listener. Great mix of upbeat/ up tempo songs and slower more romantic/ thoughtful songs.
1401207529|5.0|Started collecting Batman comics again, and wanted to get this to go with my current selection. Product came in good packaging with no issues.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|One of the best of Percy Jackson´s saga. Impossible to leave the book without knowing what´s going to happen next. The only problem is to have to wait for 6 months for the next book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I wont get into the arguments going on about packaging, other than to say, &#34;Look at the photos, is this what you want the box to look like? If you don't care, buy this one.&#34;<br /><br />Great price for all three movies, discs with extras, even a cool book. As an added bonus, despite not seeing it on the outside of the box, the UltraViolet codes were inside, so now I have all three movies available to stream.
B002BWP49C|5.0|What can i say... My favorite series movie.  From the first Twilight to breaking Dawn pt 2.  There is not anything bad I can say...movie rec'd some negative comments about the limited sexual scene and the birth scene. But they need to realize that this couple waited till they were married to consumate. So this scene was between 2 married (to each other no less)  people.  That hardly happens in movies any more.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|NCIS LA is the best of the TV shows viewing today.  The stars are real in characterization, entertaining with their quips, real in their concern for their fellow partners, boss and director.  I look forward to finding out more about each characters personal past and present status.<br /><br />The writers on this show are right on and I can't wait to watch more of NCIS LA.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I expected this book to be vegan propaganda, but it turned out to be a very interesting look into factory farming from both sides of the fence (I am, and have been, a herbivore by the way).<br /><br />The author takes you (in a non confronting way) through our current corporate run animal raising practices, and he highlights a few family operations that are doing it the old fashioned way.  I found the journey of the family farms and their struggles fascinating.<br /><br />This book doesn't make any conclusions or suggestions for you it just presents some interesting information using some good story telling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for herbivores looking for inspiration or motivation, and maybe even for open minded omnivores or omnivores curious about where their &#34;food&#34; is coming from.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie sucked monster balls, Acting Sucked. Plot was weak, I expected more but was sorely disappointed. Just plain crap
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I found myself getting too busy to read but involved in the story.  Paired with Alan Cummings read where I left off, I was able to continue while driving to work.  Even though I knew the story (I was my own spoiler...), it was still engaging, and I enjoyed going back to a chill that didn't rely on gore to frighten.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is the best FM transmitter I have ever owned. I have not ONCE heard any static through my speakers. I have only used with my iPod, not with the SD card, but it seems super easy to use. SO glad I purchased it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Totally worth the 99 cents I paid for it! It's so fun and you can make many different combinations. Hats, glasses, hair dye, a straightener, a curler, scissors, bows, shampoo, a comb, backgrounds for taking pictures. and lots more. I recommend you buy this =] One suggestion I have for the creators is to make more characters to work on. That would be awesome.  But 4 is perfectly fine. (a man, two women, and a monkey)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really like John Grisham. I know his books can be redundant but I still like it when the good guy wins and I like his style.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Really funny movie. All my friends love it a lot! I saw it two time!<br />Ted rocks! You got to see it!
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|This is my new favorite comedy. But keep in mind that this is not for children! But hilarious.  Watch it and laugh you a@# off.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My granddaughters loved it! They sat in front of the TV the whole time and didn't budge.  It was very entertaining and had a good story.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|this game is easy and fun to play when needing a few minutes to relax during the busy holiday season.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You find yourself so engulfed in the series that you can not stop reading. You want more and I will and have purchased others in the series.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|He has a good writing style and keeps me wanting to read more. I have read a few of his books and they are all different but with a nice message.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a brilliant program.  It syncs with my PC, my Notebook, my Netbook, my Kindle and my android phone seamlessly. It holds everything from web pages to simple notes to complex itineraries.<br /><br />Evernote is my &#34;go-to&#34; program for retaining information.  Thank you EVERNOTE!
0307891372|5.0|I would recommend this book to ANYONE who plays this game. It makes the game so much more easier when it comes to potions, maps, smithing and quests. It also helps if you are trying to find a certain person but can't remember where you met them. This is my favorite game on the PS3. I used this book A LOT. However, I would recommend getting the HARDCOVER over the paperback. Using the paperback will, after much use, fall apart. While, the hardcover will stay together a lot longer. It's worth paying the extra few dollars to keep it together longer, otherwise you would have to pay for replacements often with the paperback.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a sci-fi lover - but this book is amazing.  I loved it and can't wait to get more of the series.  You can see a bit of the Hunger Games stolen from this book.  I love it!
B001H5X7JS|5.0|Awesome movie.  This is a must own for anyone that enjoys laughing.....so pretty much......everyone......yes everyone should own this movie.  You will not be disappointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|You find yourself so engulfed in the series that you can not stop reading. You want more and I will and have purchased others in the series.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who wants the truth about the coward osama. These Navy Seals are incredible in what they do for us. I can't imagine the lives these guys live day to day to keep us safe and free.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is intuitive and simple to use (maybe that's saying the same thing).  As both a timer and alarm it serves its intended purpose.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I love this movie. My husband bought it because he really likes anime. We sat and watched it and loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes anime
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Wasn't sure I was going to like this show when I first heard about it, but it's so well done! I will miss it when it ends
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I purchased this for a coworker because I have Prime.  I am assuming she loves the calculator.  She has an accounting degree and has stated this is a must for her field.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|If you think you like fun you don't know until you've listened to this cd is so much more than I could have expected! I listen to it allllll the time! Worth it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This guy is AWESOME!  He is a walking understatement. I love his perspective on what he does and how he does it. I would love to meet this guy. (but not in a dark alley)
B004JZBGWI|2.0|I tried this unassuming app - and then stopped using it.  There are far better ways to keep notes than this.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! I was sooo happy to find it at half price so soon after it was released on DVD. I would HIGHLY recommend this show if you like comedies!
157421327X|3.0|As an artist, I didn't really need this guide, but it is an interesting starting point for inspiration and to see what others have developed.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|When I first started looking for a heatsink for my new build, I was initially looking at the Corsair series of watercooled heatsinks but they were all very expensive, and I had already spent more than my budget. To cut costs, I started looking elsewhere and stumbled onto this gem. I snagged it for 24 bucks and have been very impressed with it. Installing it wasn't the easiest thing in the world, but I have had to deal with worse. The price and performance make up for it, which is why I gave it a 5.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quiet<br />My i5 is running at 25C on startup<br />Comes with brackets for a second 120MM fan, which is really easy to install<br />Mounting bracket sits tightly on motherboard<br />Wasn't so big as to force me to cut a hole in the case as others have complained (I have the Antec P280)<br />I was worried about it being so massive it would get in the way of other components, everything cleared it including ram<br /><br />Cons:<br />Install was a little tedious, but you can't expect such a massive thing hanging on the side of the cpu to be easy to install
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a compact knife sharpner, OK for the price, good for ruck sack and camping.  I would recommend for the price.
B0049IHX2C|4.0|Besides packaging issues, i loved this item. It will be a Christmas gift so im just glad it wasn't damaged.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|JD is such a character.. I'm surprised he can do as many characters as he does. Was a good campy fun movie !
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I would HIGHLY recommend this show if you like comedies! This show is so funny. My whole family loves this show and a lot of my friends. I got this at a great price, and even still, I would buy this at full price.
B002UD56I6|4.0|I originally saw this movie in Amazon Prime Video and liked it.  After all MJ is a legend in the music landscape and when I got this offer for a few bucks, I thought it doesn't hurt. It's a piece of history anyway.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|The best guns and roses songs on this cd. Geat buy just wish the cover came with something cool because it is a greatest hits. Maybe a mini poster or something
B000ATQYT2|5.0|We have watched with show yearly ,but on VCR.  Now I am updated and can watch it on our new tv.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|If you want to see Michael Jackson at the very top of his game then get this video. It is Michael Jackson in total perfection.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|As I'm nearing the age of these characters, I found the movie interesting, might even buy it.. Was fun too..
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Really like the actors in this movie! I think it was worth watching. Don't know that I would watch it again but it was pretty good.
0131480057|5.0|You always look for a definitive guide that you can keep getting back to, like the old and venerable teacher, who has an answer to pretty much all the questions you come across. For Unix and Linux practising amateurs like, this is such a companion.  The writing is so lucid and enjoyable without losing the focus and rigor that I can read it in my bus ride, even without a computer in front of me.<br />Highly recommended.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect for my Harry Potter loving granddaughter!!! She will be so excited to get this collection for Christmas, I am sure a Harry Potter marathon will be in our near future!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I just recently saw this movie and thought it was a good one to keep for yearly Christmas viewing.  Thanks
0698118308|4.0|I love Eric Carle. After reading this we painted clouds with shaving cream. It was a great sensory experience. Carle's books always lend themselves to great projects and themes.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|They didn't follow the book very well. Did not explain what was really going on at all.. I was disappointed.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was great! Would watch it again! Really enjoyed it. Amazon does a great job at getting movies early
B0026IUXO2|3.0|All of the actors do an amazing job. I really liked the movie when it first came out, but when I recently watched it again after watching all 4 seasons of the Tudors - I was a little disappointed in Elizabeth. They were both written by the same man and the Tudors was much more historically accurate than Elizabeth was.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I've only been using this for a few days but I have found it to be very effective in protecting my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. It is padded on the inside and the device fit is snug. The zipper moves smoothly.
B008Y2IU12|4.0|I was reserved about seeing this but must admit I was impressed with the way it was made and with the performances, especially Kristen Stewart.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|The last book in Stephanie Myers saga is the best one, in my opinion.  She ties up a lot of loose ends, and her story makes sense, at least in terms of the world she is trying to portray.  It's apparent she did her homework on vampire mythology, because she introduces the concept of an offspring that is partly living human, partly vampire. This concept is NOT new to this book or this generation! The 1/2 vampire is well noted in literature - it has a generic name - the &#34;damphyre&#34;... or &#34;damphire&#34;.  So she has built upon an existing mythical concept, in a way that is wholy 21st Century in its style.<br /><br />The last movie (well, 2 movies) in the video sequels of the Twilight Saga is an entertaining and interesting movie.  Clearly the book, &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34; is far too large a novel to fit comfortably in a single 2 hour movie! There's enough material in the novel for 3 or 4 movies, if somebody wanted to belabor the point, so to speak.  I think the director broke the story at a good spot - and clearly this is the current trend in movies, to break up big stories into several sequels.  That may annoying to some people, but I think we'll all get accustomed to it, in time.
B000006TRV|5.0|It is Pink Floyd, enough said.  It is unbelievable.  Great job Roger, David, Nick and Richard.  You also have to own Dark Side Of The Moon.
0525952926|3.0|It was unfortunate that 30 pages were missing from the book. It was bound inproperly! I do however like Ken follett
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This was NOT Jason Bourne or anything of the such.  This was a guy hooked on steriods/virus and he needed his FIX.  There was no action until the end and then it was, &#34;that's it?&#34;.  The movied ended with the inclination that there will be another one to follow.  I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you have two hours to kill and there is nothing better to do with your life.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|This movie doesn't stop with the action.  I was surprised.  Kept me on the edge of my chair throughout.  Mark Wahlberg is truly a terrific actor.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I loved this season, I was sad through most of it and it made me cry but that's okay. I really enjoyed watching it and while its not my favorite season of supernatural I still loved it.
0316069434|1.0|I have been a long-time Michael Connelly fan but once before he wrote a real clunker, and here we are again!<br />I like to have even my down-time books to be well written, and this just is not. I did not finish it. I will never finish it. The writing is very poor and what I did read gave me no reason to continue. I knew nothing about the victim, nothing about the protagonist. I had found no reason to care what happened to either, and not the faintest curiousity about the plot.<br />I will say this for Mr. Connelly: he is consistently inconsistent.<br />I get the feeling he threw this together to have something with which to meet a deadline.<br />Save your money.<br />Try Marcia Muller.
0321701763|5.0|This book really helped me with the foundational information I needed to be successful with Adobe products. I have not only read this book, but use it as a daily reference.<br /><br />I also use the classroom in a book for Adobe Illustrator.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Just like all teamviewer software, works right away.<br />I use this software alot to maintain computers and think it is as good as any purchased software.
B009329ZF2|5.0|If you liked the game Battleship you will enjoy how they incorporated many of the things from the game into the movie.  There is a little bit you have to take with a grain of salt cause it's a patriotic movie but there is no way a crew of a few could carry a 2200 lbs projectile from one end of the ship to the other.<br /><br />I actually had the pleasure of firing/shooting the USS Missouri before she was decommissioned.  What an awesome sight when those 16&#34; guns are a blaze.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Good movie for kids and adults alike.  Great animation.  The rat had a great voice as did Mrs. Fox.  Highly recommend.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is amazing! the only but is that the cds are blue and has its name, no artwork.<br />but that is not at all important.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Pretty run of the mill action movie.  Maybe I should lower my expectations of Denzel...also, Ryan Reynolds should return to comedy if you ask me.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|What can i say about this. Its a great movie full of all the comic book heros we love. And respect.dont take my word for it see for yourself. Oh the only little problem i have with it is the guy who plays hulk sucks. They should have stuck with ed norton. Other then that. Everyone pulls there parts off just fine.
0307949486|5.0|a different approach to mystery and very readable.  Will be reading the rest of the books in the trilogy.  Thanks
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took way to long to grab my attention and once it did I was let down. Don't bother with it.

B006YXTRHY|5.0|I chose this rating because this movie and all the other Twilights  are great movies i can watch over and over again.
B004LWZW4M|1.0|This movie was like a worse version of iRobot, with apes in place of robots.  Just another excuse to overuse special effects...Shame on you James Franco, shame.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect from this book....but, I was well worth it to read this memior... Peter lays it all out there. I know that every rocker and their brother are putting out books these days, however I like this one for its honesty and he is hardest on himself throughout! Now I'm sure that there will be a Paul Stanley book refuting all that is in this book...but thats how it goes...<br />Read on and enjoy the wild life on the road with KISS in the 70's not the half band that they are now!
1609611543|4.0|I agree with what the author has to say about wheat, and I think our nation's health would be far different if it weren't a staple in most of our diets.  The author goes to great lengths to spell out the negative effects that this grain can have.  Some of the claims are strong:  storage of visceral fat, wreaking havoc on our blood sugar, and inflammation.  I have heard these before, and had cut out wheat in my diet before reading this book.  Some of the other claims (acne, anxiety, skin ailments and more) are more anecdotal in their link to wheat.<br /><br />What I don't care for, though, is that in the end it becomes a very restrictive diet for maximum weight loss.  I realize some people will like this, but not me.  Essentially, the author wants you to avoid not only wheat, but all sources of carbohydrates save the very occasional fruit.  I don't want to or need to lose weight, and I exercise vigorously.  I fuel my workouts and replenish my glycogen by eating rice or sweet potatoes as a side dish with my dinner.  I believe this to be healthier and more realistic than eating as many raw nuts (which I do enjoy and eat often), meats, and cheeses as you can.<br /><br />I also feel that the author's prescription to avoid tubers (potatoes) and rice, because they are also carb sources which stimulate the release of insulin, to make his argument against wheat weaker.  In the end, he's basically against eating anything that triggers insulin to be released.  If I were 60 pounds overweight, maybe this would be practical, but not for someone at their optimal weight simply looking to optimize their health for a lifetime.<br /><br />I do agree with his short plug for fasting.  I have found that without wheat or refined grains, I no longer have hunger pangs every couple of hours, and can easily go extended periods with only water.<br /><br />I also think the author should have placed more of an emphasis on eating quality meats.  I think giving up wheat but still eating red meat raised on grain (rather than grass-fed) and full of antibodies is not much of an improvement.  I also think that if weight loss is not your goal, eating fresh, seasonal fruits should not be strictly limited.<br /><br />I have found that works best is to follow the author's guidelines during the daytime, focusing on vegetables and protein from eggs/meat, along with a few serving of raw nuts and raw seeds.  No carbs.  However, at dinner still focus on plenty of veggies, quality meat, and a decent-sized side of sweet potatoes, brown rice, or quinoa.  This really satiates you, allows you to sleep better, and replenishes you for the next day.  This is especially essential if you workout or play sports.  In fact, I add a small amount  of carbs earlier in the day, like a banana along with protein, to my diet immediately following a workout.<br /><br />Oops, sorry for the length.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire season! Def a MUST SEE for anyone who likes action shows!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Game play:<br />There are 6 chapters to the storyline and each one has multiple levels that you have to work your way through to reach the next level.  Jumping is automatic and you control the direction that he jumps and how quickly he moves in the direction you want to move in.  Moving faster can make you jump further.  The graphics are much better on the Kindle Fire than the pictures that Amazon shows them.<br /><br />Each level has goals and they are to find your pet and save it, jump as few times as possible and collect all of the jewels.  The game is challenging so you may have to replay a level multiple times to achieve all of the goals but it is fun enough to play you won't care.  Your kids will like this one.<br /><br />Avoid jumping on the spikes and if you can jump on the monster's or the bird's head and eliminate them.<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Exit<br />* Settings - watch intro (takes you to YouTube), credits, buy music album (Takes you to the musician's website to buy the album for $5), reset all data, set control scheme, Turbo Mode.<br />* Turn off music<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game is fun and has action and it is challenging.  The graphics are very good and really much better than shown on the Amazon web site.  The music is nice also.<br /><br />I like that when you get killed you restart at the last check point instead of going back to the beginning.  This makes continuing more fun.  This game also uses no permissions and I commend the developers for that.  In this game you are trying to beat the obstacles and the monsters and birds and not trying to beat the clock.  This is nice as I hate where some games are almost unbeatable only because of the clock timer!<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />There are links to YouTube, the musician's web site and social networks so set your parental controls and turn off your WIFI.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a very good game and it is well designed.  It is a simple left to right jumping game but the controls work well and I like the graphics a lot.  I expected to see old style pixelated graphics but they are well designed and look great on my Kindle Fire.  This is a good app and a good FAOTD.  I rate it as a 5 star app.<br /><br />Your family will like this game and it will be a real time burner for them.  There are a lot of levels to play and trying to perfect your score adds to the challenge.  I don't know if it is worth $2.99 because the most fun game I own is that price but it certainly is a game that is above average and worth owning.  Get it while it is free!<br /><br />Size:  The app is 20.9 MB compressed and 27.61 MB uncompressed.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* There are none!t the controls work well and I like the graphics a lot.

B005ETKNJ0|1.0|I originally ordered this book, the regular sized version, and they sent me the mass production version even though they made no reference that it was the smaller sized version. They are the ONLY company that sent me the wrong one, and I bought all five books of this collection. I wrote a bad review, and they promised to send me the correct one if I removed it, and so I removed it, and it's been 3 MONTHS! I STILL havent received the book. They are all professional in their emails, but who cares when you pay for something you never receive?? I don't want your professionalism without your ethics!

B00AE6SS5O|5.0|What fun!! This may be my favorite HOG yet! Cute story, nice graphics, puzzles that are challenging but doable even for a no longer young person, and not a math whiz! Love it, and will look for more games by these guys! The abominable snowman is adorable... would love to play more games with him.
B00493E1GI|3.0|I have read the book so in my humble opinion it's usually a mistake to expect much of the movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Frankly, I've not watched any of their YouTube videos. You do not need the videoclips to sell this....it sells itself good enough. Excellent album, very innovative in combining music genres some would say are poles apart. Whole family (aged from 10-45) loves it!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one!

B004LWZWGK|4.0|Warner Bros Home Entertainment brings \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" home for the holidays. I can honestly say that the epic last chapter in Christopher Nolan's trilogy loses nothing in a home viewing environment. It moves along quicker than I remember when seeing it in the theater. That says a lot since I saw it three times before watching it again on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" closes out the series with Batman making a return to Gotham City after years of silence. The hero disappeared after being blamed for the death of Harvey Dent. The arrival of a deadly new villain calling himself Bane draws the Caped Crusader out of hiding. Batman joins forces with a criminal named Catwoman and the police department to bring Bane and his band of militant thugs down and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, his brother Jonathan, and David S. Goyer crafted one of the most ambitious conclusions to a film series ever witnessed on the silver screen. Everything about \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" satisfied my expectations. Things I thought I would have a problem with I ended up accepting happily. I can't think of a better way for \\"The Dark Knight\\" trilogy to come to an end.<br /><br />The audio and video quality for \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is spectacular. The high-definition picture is clean without losing any of its cinematic splendor. The 5.1 surround sound delivers all the bangs, breathing, and pummeling punches intensely. Hans Zimmer's incredible musical score blends triumphantly with the dialogue and adds a whole other level of emotion to the film.<br /><br />Over three hours of special features will keep Batman fans busy after taking in the movie. There's twelve production featurettes that cover everything from the Batcave to Gotham's underground and Wall Street. Three character featurettes focus on Bruce Wayne, Bane, and Selina Kyle. \\"Reflections\\" is comprised of three featurettes concentrating on Wally Pfister's cinematography and lighting, the location shoots, traditional vs. IMAX photography, the film's production design, and the filmmakers saying goodbye to the trilogy. An app gives you access to even more exclusive content.<br /><br />Batman fans will be pleased with \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" on Blu-ray. The three-disc combo pack comes with the feature film on both Blu-ray and DVD, special features on a separate disc, and access to a digital download of the movie for viewing on the go. This truly is one of the greatest finishes to a movie series and gives enthusiasts of the DC character the closure they desired.ing, the location shoots, traditional vs. IMAX photography, the film's production design, and the filmmakers saying goodbye to the trilogy.

0553801473|1.0|After waiting 6 years for this book I am profoundly disappointed. If possible I would give this book a 0 star rating. There is significant chapter bloat where GRRM seems to prattle on and on and on, yet not advance the plot. The \\"cliff-hangers\\" seem endless in a decidedly Lost-esque fashion. Tyrion seems to have lost something and the only explanation I have is that in taking so freaking long to write the book, GRRM himself changed and that was reflected in his writing. One of the TV themed cliff-hangers from AFFC is resolved in a wholly anti-climatic paragraph long blurb with no further exploration of that plot line. I only wish I had shown a little more restraint and waited for the library to have the book available for check out instead of buying the hard cover for myself. I recommend that if you do wish to read this book that you check it out from the library. And if GRRM manages to stave off death long enough to actually finish the series (which I seriously doubt), borrow a copy from the library.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book has an amazing plot line that makes you want to keep reading. Not only do you get many ideas for use with the one you love, but you get an amazing story that you never want to put down. You have to find out what happens next. I have had many sleepless nights reading this book and never regret a single one.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|This app brought back memories, very tragic memories! An app where the goal is to make it to the border as a jumping bean... This is a very sensitive subject. I am an undocumented immigrant, and this app reminds me of how I got here. Let me tell you aboot it, ay. Me and my buddies were all packed up in the back of a U-Haul truck, sneaking over the north Dakota border on a cold winters night, right aboot this time of year, ay. Our truck hit black ice and flipped a few times, scattering us all aboot the highway. We were pretty messed up, ay. So, all my buddies decided to go back to Canada for free healthcare, but not me, I wasn't aboot to step foot back in Canada, ay. So I made it all the way to Arizona, where all the Canadians go, never seeing my buddies again... Until I got profiled under sb1070, busted by sheriff Joe and sent to tent city... But that is another story I'll tell you aboot another time, so for now, I'm just a dreamer!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Great for the whole family.  It's a movie that can be watched every Christmas with it's message of hope and faith.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This game is awesome. I have tons of fun playing it.  It is very addicting for kids of all ages.
B00AJGAVAO|5.0|Keep in mind these are mini-series, not series. Therefore the settings change with each season. We all loved Season 1 with \\"Murder House\\", and now we get to watch the actor's/actresses from Season 1 take on new roles in an equally twisted (perhaps even scarier (Bloody Face.....)) scenario in the Asylum.<br /><br />All in all I think the twists are well thought out, the character planning is exceptional, and aside from Bloody Face and Santa, you find yourself frequently flip flopping between love and hate with each of the characters.
0545091020|5.0|I promised my daughter I would read the story before I saw the movie. Being on the road all the time, the CDs were an excellent way to achieve this.  Better than I expected! Couldn't wait to get on the road again to hear the story!
1400064287|5.0|The Heath Brothers practice what they preach. Two years after reading their book (for the first time), I still remember many of the anecdotes they shared; those case studies make their underlying and more substantive points even stickier.<br /><br />As a media trainer, I regularly see the \\"Curse of Knowledge\\" prevent spokespersons from delivering a clear message that reaches their audiences - the Heath Brothers' \\"knocking test\\" is a fun way of making that point to otherwise obstinate spokespersons. Their SUCCESs formula is an easily-remembered way to create more effective messages. Stories about a newspaper editor and an airline CEO were great ways to make the point about a message's \\"core.\\" And if you don't know what a pomelo is, you're in for an \\"ah ha!\\" moment.<br /><br />I disagree with the Heath Brothers on one point. They say that a strong message should only have to be delivered once to work (they take aim at people like me who preach the importance of repetition). I'd add a caveat that it depends on the format. For example, a spokesperson who gives an hour-long interview and only mentions their key message once will fail, since listeners who tune in later in the hour will never have heard it. But that's a small point, and I suspect we'd agree on that point more than we disagree.<br /><br />Overall, I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who needs to market a message. Made to Stick is smart and spot-on, yes, but it's also just plain fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! Have it on my phone and my Kindle HD  use it everyday and love it especially because I can make the background PINK!

B005ML9YOU|4.0|As far as I can tell this contains every Sherlock Holmes story, I have as yet found no errors in the digital transcription and each story is well indexed.<br />The Stories themselves vary in quality and readers will probably like some more than others however overall it's a classic that should not be missed.<br />You will become emersed in Victorian London and the dictionary function will improve the reading experience clarifying various terms and names that will be unfamiliar to modern readers.<br />If you have never read Holmes, some stories are available to download free read them and if you enjoy them then you will enjoy this book.<br />It may be a little more expensive than some of the other versions offered digitally however, having read all the reviews of the others I am of the opinion that the quality of conversion and completeness of content makes the additional cost worthwhile.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It wasn't what I expected, but couldn't put it down.  I'm on Book two now.  I did feel anxious when reading and sometimes had to take a day or two between readings..

B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I couldn't  continue with this book after the first few chapters. It's  basically an amalgam of stereotyped irish characters who have featured for many years in Irish literature. As an irish person I've  heard it all before many times. I did initially enjoy the writing style but it was not enough to make up for the leprauchaniness of it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The most unique fantasy novel I've read in years. I enjoyed it so much that I can't put it into words. Read it. You will not be disappointed.

B005HSL626|4.0|I was recently introduced to this game, and I like it.  I like the different game modes and being able to take it easy with Zen Mode/no bombs.  One thing I noticed is that while apps such as Facebook, Twitter apps and Words with Friends use up your battery while you're not even using the device, Fruit Ninja actually quits when you choose to quit the game.  That is a big plus, and it is a fun game.  I don't fool around much on my mobile devices, so making it easy to avoid annoyances like eating up my battery life means something to me.  The ads that so many people accept are still annoying, and will never cease to be annoying, but I will put up with them in order to play and take off a star just for forcing them on me.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|What a great book. I found it a little confusing and overwhelming at first but the pay off is worth it. After the first 150 pages you won't be able to put it down.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|LOVE it! I think that fact is amply shown by the fact that I'm giving it 5 stars! It had some language (check on IMDB for specifics) and a little immodesty, but while that would take the rating down for many movies, it didn't here. The rest of the movie made it up for it amply. :) The action is amazing, and I really enjoyed the intricate plot twists and the thought that goes into each crime! All the guys are amazing, and I enjoyed \\"getting to know\\" them, especially Charlie, who remained my favorite throughout. I can tell I'll want to watch this movie again and again in the years to come!

B000063DHL|5.0|This was my first heavy metal album. All my older friends listened to them, and I used some birthday money sent in a gift card from a relative, to buy \\"Somewhere in Time\\", on cassette. I was thirteen, in the mids 80s, riding my bike, when \\"Somewhere in Time\\" first beamed into my head through the earphones of a Sony walkman. I was hooked.<br /><br />What other band gave you history lessons wrapped in a power metal ballad? You could study for class with \\"Alexander the Great\\" and other similar historical-based songs on their other albums. I also loved how long many of their songs were and the way the song would totally change the pace or feel halfway through or segue into an extended solo before coming back to the end. I like all the songs on the album, but I had a special fondness for \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"Sea of Madness\\", \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", and \\"Alexander the Great\\".<br /><br />Pure heavy metal from the classic metal era. I still love Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time, (well) over twenty years later.<br /><br />\^^/_

B009AMANBA|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />First off, \\"Lincoln\\" is more about the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery in the U.S. and all the haggling that took place in the House of Representatives beforehand than it is about Abe Lincoln personally. The entire story takes place in the early months of 1865 as the Civil War is winding down.<br /><br />Lincoln does, of course, play a pivotal role as the central character in his proposal and backing of the Amendment (yet still, kind of not wanting the war to end before it was voted upon in order to keep the Southern delegations out of the vote). There is also a fine subplot concerning Lincoln's life with his wife and sons, all of whom are admirably played. Day-Lewis really shines in  his role as a Lincoln who is neither saint nor sinner, with a smooth, velvety, and vaguely southern(!) accent. Many of the supporting cast--most particularly, Jared Harris as Ulysses Grant--are also memorably portrayed.<br /><br />This may not sound terribly exciting to some, but the acting, storyline, scenery and everything else are so arresting that those people are likely to forget not being all that interested. Along with the vital ingredient of plot, some other best things about \\"Lincoln\\" are its setting and costume design: This film probably conveys the Civil War period better than any that I've seen. There isn't much actual showing of the war, but a couple of very brief but vivid and ultra-realistic battleground scenes really spice things up. Both in Washington and in the brief scenes elsewhere, the cinematography takes you there in a powerful way.<br /><br />Finally, this film is very revealing about the \\"buying\\" of votes in Congress and effectively shows how political processes worked and continue to work. A fascinating bit of historical and political intrigue.<br /><br />A couple of tips:<br /><br />--Younger audiences, unless they happen to have an unusual interest in political processes, are likely to be bored with \\"Lincoln.\\"<br /><br />--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players (maybe check the character list on imdb?), it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this./>--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players (maybe check the character list on imdb?), it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|What an absolute disappointment! If you want a film with adequate graphics then this is your film. If you want a film carried by 1.Michael Caine 2.Morgan Freeman 3.Gary Oldman and 4.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then this film is for you. if you want a long drawn-out bad plot that keeps you wondering when the real film will begin and let you out of the hell whole your sitting through of all 165 min, then this film is for you.<br /><br />I can't believe I waited for this film and then sat for 2 hours and 45 minutes of nothing but shallow characters (save for the actors mentioned above). this isn't a sequel, it's a curse! For anyone with half a mind that has not spent their life dedicated to video games and are so desensitized to anything save things blowing up, yes this film is a curse. All in all, I rather like Tim Burton's Batman better.<br /><br />.........Did I mention I didn't like it?
034580404X|5.0|The  three books were awesome.  What started out as what some thought to be a perverted relationship ended up being a remarkable love story.  I couldn't put the books down.  I went from one to the other barely stopping.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|By a wide range, this is the best of Dream Theater's concert DVDs.  The play list spans multiple albums, Mr. LaBrie's voice doesn't falter (unlike on certain other live DVDs, such as Metropolis Part 2 (sorry James!)), and the band was at the top of their game.  If you only want to buy one concert DVD of this band, this is the one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this series. I tore through all 3 of them in a weekend. I was hooked. Perhaps not the absolute best writing I have ever read, but the story is great and you definitely get invested in the characters. However, of the 3 books, I found this one to be the least exciting and the slowest read. Obviously, I don't want to give anything away, but personally I was a bit disappointed in the end. It felt very quickly and hastily wrapped up, as if the auther just wanted to get it done. I feel the ending, after all we had been through in the last 2 books, could have been fleshed out a little bit more and would have, therefore, been a more enjoyable experience. It felt like a bit of a let down to me. That is just a personal reaction, though. Regardless, I definitely recommend reading this series, if you are one of the few who have not yet.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I've loved the band since their 'Songs About Jane' album and they still have that distinct, stand-out, recognizable sound.  I love the jazzy sound the songs often have and I hope to one day see them live for the full experience.  Can't wait for the next one already.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I purchased this dockStub to upconvert the charge to power my iPhone 4S with my car's iSimple iphone/ipod dock. Does not work. I contacted dockStubz and they sent me replacement which also did not work. When I contacted them stating that it still does not work, they said to contact Amazon for a refund. Since the 30-day window expired, I cannot get a full refund and would need to pay for my own shipping charge.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the customer service of Cablejive. Apparently their 1 year warranty doesn't really apply if the product doesn't work at all as advertised.
B00AHSFPZ0|3.0|I love this show, but this season (8) is a little painful to watch. Becoming too much like a drama, and rarely witty anymore, which is one of the things I really love about the early seasons.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|it is fun. I would say a little disappointing when you open the doors what's inside is a little cheesy but it is a perfect game for kids.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is definite one of Dream Theater's top five releases - simply put, there are no weak tracks on the album (unlike Black Clouds) and many of the elements which attract Dream Theater fans are present.
B003FSTN52|5.0|It was very good to watch again.  We viewed the 1st season in just over<br />a week's time.  I liked it so much that I order the second season, which<br />we are watching now.
1847394078|5.0|I wanted this book because I saw the movie and loved it! But getting it through Source IE was the best choice I ever made!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game!  At first it seems to be too easy and I thought I would be bored with it quickly but, as the levels increase you have to think and learn to recognize patterns.  It became much more fun and challenging especially if you challenge yourself to finish each level in the least number of moves possible.  I also enjoy the unlimited play.  You don't have to wait for something to regenerate.  You can play until you are tired of playing.  And it's FREE!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Depressing...turns up the ugly underbelly of life without balancing it with positivity.<br /><br />Is this a metaphor for the fake surface we put on life?  Even it if were meant to be that, it's still unbalanced and inaccurate.<br /><br />If you loved Harry Potter, stay away.
0062082353|5.0|Thank-you to Chris Kyle for sharing his story.  This book just made us appreciate our awesome USA military all the more!<br />Our country is so blessed to have these unselfish, honorable men and women protecting us!
1609611543|5.0|Just over 7 months ago I was told by my medical practitioner that I most likely had a wheat/gluten sensitivity.  I did some research, found a little information and decided to give up grains.  I am never one to just take someone's word on something though, and need to dive in deeper to learn more about the \\"hows and whys\\".  I came across Dr. Davis' book on Amazon and after reading many interesting reviews decided to buy the book.  It was an eye opener for me and I only wish that I had known this information many years ago!  Knowledge is a powerful thing.  Within the first month of going completely grain free I felt a fog lift - my thought processes became clearer.  It sounds crazy but it has been so apparent to me.  The swelling in my knees and ankles is completely gone.  My face is no longer puffy - I actually have cheekbones again!  I no longer live for my next dose of Ibuprofen.  My skin is clear.  My stomach is no longer bloated and gone are the frequent trips to the bathroom.  My gums no longer bleed when I brush my teeth.  My sinusitis is almost nonexistent.  I have more energy.  I used to have frustrating mood swings - gone. I am almost never hungry between meals.  After meals I do not feel the lethargy that I used to experience.  I could go on and on, and believe me, if someone asks me about my new way of eating, I do go on and on.  And people listen.  I can't tell you how many times I have recommended Wheat Belly to friends and even patients (I'm a nurse).  No one needs to take my word on it though.  Read the book and then try going grain-free for a month.  See for yourself.  It's a small investment of time and effort with potentially huge payoffs!  Oh and by following the low carb diet info at the end of the book I have lost 45 pounds over the past 7 months.  It continues to come off slowly but I am patient and do not plan to ever change from this way of eating.  It's really too easy!! Just one last note, my husband follows this same way of eating and is right on board with me.  His rheumatoid arthritis is much improved and he has gone down a pants size.  He was only slightly overweight and has now got a much flatter abdomen.  Wonderful book!  Thank you Dr. Davis.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A heartbreaking story, but such a well written book. I immediately went and rented the movie after finishing the book. A must read.
B00001OH7P|5.0|How could any classic rock collection be considered complete without David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust?  Good tunes, good vibes and a trip back to yesteryear.
B001H1SVO8|2.0|I may be going against the grain by saying this but I absolutely hated this book and movie. Such a horrible plot line.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|You are much better to got to dropbox.com and download the mobile version. You will simply waste your time with this app.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have seen in along time.  Yes it is for children, but adults will love it as well.  This movie speaks to all of us moms out there and love and devotion we have for our family.  I laughed and cried!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Worked great splitting a signal over 50+ ft with perfect image on both sides.  What more can you ask for.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|good game for a beginner to learn on and for the more experienced player to practice with.<br /> also a great free game.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I bought this because I enjoyed the first one.  This was fine and I would purchase the next installment, if they make one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like putting puzzles together but don't have the time to put large jigsaw puzzles together.  These puzzles are the perfect size and handy whenever I have the time!
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I had been regularly working out using Jillian Michaels DVDs when I became pregnant.  After switching to light cardio only in the first trimester, I decided I still needed some sort of resistance training.  When I tried this early in my second trimester I thought it was a joke!  Compared to 30 Day Shred, this DVD is like taking a nap on your couch!  However, I am now well into my third trimester and this exercise DVD is probably just about perfect for my needs right now.  I told my husband, \\"I kept expecting it to just get easier but it keeps getting harder!\\"  I feel like it does a good job of hitting various parts of the body.<br /><br />I'm giving it four stars because the production quality is REALLY low.  And I know that doing workout DVDs means that you will have to listen to the same banter from the instructor over and over, but her constant reminders about not overextending my back get annoying.<br /><br />Generally I am pleased with this DVD, but looking forward to starting up 30 Day Shred again in a few months!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I love batman, always will. I really expected this movie to be more amazing than the Dark Knight (I love the Dark Knight) but unfortunately no. I went to the theatres right when the movie premiere and I was so excited. The movie is good, there are moments where you will be shock and amazed.<br /> For me what ruin the movie a bit was almost all the scenes and the interaction between the characters was rushed. You barely see Batman fight in hand to hand combat in the movie. He spends the majority of his time in some type of vechicle and you barely see him in the movie too because the main focus is on Bane.<br /> When it comes to Alfred I always thought of him as someone who would stand by Bruce's side no matter what. Not in this movie though.<br /> They didn't need a romantic interest, Rachel already filled that spot and now that she's dead there's no purpose for Bruce to suddenly fall in love with someone in one day i.e. Talia.<br /> I wanted the movie to end with Batman saving the day and being recognize as a hero to Gotham (being alive) and him standing on top of a tall building watching over the city. Batman does saved the day and he is seen as a hero to Gotham but he has to fake his death in order to do that and that sucks. However, at least someone takes his spot when Bruce retires.
0896898288|2.0|I liked seeing the different patterns and reading the stories behind them, but I was disappointed with the patterns. They were not traceable, the pattern pieces are on a CD at the back of the book. Each pattern contains a number of pieces and each piece must be printed on a separate piece of paper... very wasteful! So, if you want to paper piece the quilt... it is not possible with this book. I returned this book.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I mean its really good but when i hatched the sun dragon and i cant name any dragons different names... and that was when i couldnt name anymore dragons different names anymore
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love that Mumford & Sons are classic sounding. I do enjoy new stuff, but this makes me smile. Anybody that enjoys old school music, needs to sample this. No, really...
1423113454|4.0|Love the book and love the author 's work.  Wo uld recommed to any one who like this author's works.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I really love this game. It works so good on my Kindle Fire HD. I am enjoying it more than any app Ive ever had on any device. The controls work just fine for me and I love the graphics. It reminds me a little of old school Mario but not so much as to seem like a copy. This is well worth the price because its super fun and has so many levels. You'll be glad you got it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is the best murder/mystery writer alive today.  The Harry Bosh series is by far and away the greatest detective character ever created
0792839749|5.0|My grandchildren loved this movie... as did my children when they were young. It is a classic Dick Van Dyke movie!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It protects my kindle, but it's kinda clunky, heavy and gives up on self-standing really quickly. Have bought myself the elegant Verso cover as a Christmas present Whatever happens it wil be beautiful
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Ok, ok.....this is first and foremost a well-done horror series. That in itself is so difficult to pull off, as so many producers substitute gore for storyline. This show, while not going easy on the gore, is well told and for both seasons unfolds in directions you didn't expect. It is written with a dark humor that matches the grim circumstances, and at times is laugh out loud funny....if only for a moment. By way of example, episode 8 with the awesome Ian McShane as a murderous Santa Claus is both frightening and humorous, with Ian adding touches of dry humor here and there....before he kills someone, of course.<br /><br />But you can't talk about this show without mentioning the acting. The writing is crisp, the sets are creepy, the storylines are very well done, hell the whole thing is creepy/scary....but none of this would matter without Jessica Lange and Zachary Quinto. Those two knock every scene they are in out of the park. I'm guilty of forgetting what a great actress Jessica Lange is, but she is here to remind us in every episode. And name one show that Zachary Quinto hasn't made better? Maybe it's the eyebrows, but Zachary is a scene-stealer, whatever character he is playing he owns. Great series, and season 2 is better than season 1. Highly recommended!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|don't buy this it Sufis so bad I almost cried jk. but its NOT WORTH THE ENTERNAL STORAGE!  espicley<br />for the kindel fire
0374533571|3.0|I'm usually let down by movies never living up to books. This is the first time I'm rooting for the movie to be better. A friend of mine really enjoyed the book so I downloaded it ON my kindle. I read it in 2 nights. I was surprised by how short the book was. The movie will need a lot of filler that's for sure. You keep waiting for something amazing to happen, a twist or a turn but blah twists that are almost always expected happen. The relationship (I use that term loosely ) between Pat and Tiffany is not even excistant. They never speak. Run with eachother. Well she runs behind him. And suddenly they are in love? Or meant to be? I'm not buying it. Just because 2 people share in a loss and mental illness does not equal love. For me I just kept waiting for something great or special to happen that never did. Just a quick okay read for me. Nothing special.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|this app is a good game to play But when it comes to updates its bad when ever it ask me to update it ti takes forever and I'm like what is goo g on then when you try to cancel the update it wouldn't work soo...... I don't recommend u try to up date it bout the app is good!!!

0449013855|4.0|Sixteen year old Jacob Portman just wanted to be fired from his job at the pharmacy.  He hated it that his uncles had other plans; they intended for him to work in the family empire, not caring what Jacob wanted to do.  What he wanted was to spend more time with his grandfather.  He would reflect back on the magical stories he used to tell him when he was young.  A floating girl, and invisible boy, and many other impossibilities.  It was easy to believe these when he was little, but now, an older and wiser Jacob knew better.  That didn't stop him from adoring Grandpa Abe.<br /><br />One day at work, Jacob received a frantic call from his grandfather telling him that the monsters were coming for him.  Jacob rushed to his side, but he was too late.  Abe laying dying, torn open by what the police later confirmed was a wild animal attack.  With his final breaths, he told Jacob to find the bird and mumbled some other cryptic details.<br /><br />Even with the help of counselling, Jacob was not able to let go of his grandfather's horrific death.  Finally, he convinced his parents that he needed to travel to the remote Welsh island where his grandfather had lived in a children's home for war orphans.  There he hoped to find some clue to Abe's final message.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book version of this twice in the past few months.  The second time I enjoyed it so much better than the first.  This second time I was able to enjoy the wealth of detail, while the first time I was so busy trying to follow the story and time lines.  This was read by Jesse Bernstein. 9 hours  42 minutes.  From Books on Tape.  The descriptions were so vivid and the voices so well done, that I was able to visualize each of the children and photographs that Jacob looked at periodically throughout the story.  It was only later that I learned that the paper version shows the discussed photos and even images of the 'letters' which Jacob reads.<br /><br />In this novel, we find that it's not easy being a teenager no matter the time period.  Jacob has to deal with bullying at school, yet his grandfather had to deal with a war and with the monsters he keeps talking about.  Then there are the other children at the home, they have to deal with the isolation from their families as well as from a normal relationship with the rest of the population of the island.<br /><br /> Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />There is only one tiny thing that bothered me in this book, and it is not something that the target audience of 14+ would notice.  Emma leads Jacob down into a sunk boat.  They are at least twelve feet underwater, and Emma picks up a hose, clears the water from it with a little puff of air and starts breathing.  Then she hands the hose to Jacob and he breaths from it.  As a trained scuba diver, this isn't going to work.  As I said, this is a small thing, and I wasn't going to let it stop me from fully enjoying this book.<br /><br />End of Spoiler Alert<br /><br />On his website, Ransom Riggs indicated that he is working on a follow up to this book which he plans to have ready at some point in 2013.asy being a teenager no matter the time period.

B002XXLKHY|4.0|This movie was adorable, simple, and funny - a truly cute movie worth watching with the family. Well, almost. Why did they feel the need to include crass language in this?!! I guess people have different standards, but there was absolutely NO value added to this film (and arguably significant value lost) by including words like &#34;hell&#34;, &#34;damn&#34;, and the phrase &#34;Oh my God.&#34; Since others don't see these as a problem, I only take off one star. I just think they missed an opportunity for more universal approval with the exact same film.
034580404X|5.0|very handy lol... i cant wait to finish them all.  i would recommend these books to women every where  lol
B0092QITO2|2.0|I gave this movie two viewing attempts and couldn't sit the whole way through it.  Someone asks me to describe this movie and I would say a whole lot of fight and chase scenes against a blizzard like backdrop of forgettable CGI scenery and eye candy amidst characters and a story I didn't care about for a second.  Another glitzy remake with a screenplay written by a marketing matrix that would get a D from a community college freshman writing class.  Other than one or two thought provoking dialogue snippets that didn't last long this movie is Eminently forgettable.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This is a fantastic game and if you like it, then you should get hidden letters.  Well worth the money.  Thank you agile fusion.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It's ok, but not the greatest. Not the greatest songs on this one. Perhaps the Christmas one is better. Does not really teah you the chords or notes.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|One of the best albums in recent time...each track is excellent and worth listening to so definitely smart to get the whole record rather than individual tracks.
B000001E77|4.0|What you want is JB's albums, not so much compilation discs as his elongated versions of songs are where he is at his and the band's best. So here for instance you get a 13-minute version of 'Papa Don't Mess' which alone is worth the price of the disk. After all, JB can 'do no wrong'?!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a kindle and dont even really need it anymore.  So easy to read on the phone and fits in my purse so much better.  Great ap.
0425263916|3.0|My Sister bought the first novel \\"Bared to you\\" and shared it with me, it was great.  So when the second novel came out and we both purchased Kindle's I bought the second \\"Reflected in You\\" to share back.  Imagine my frustration when I learned I couldn't share it and it cost more on the Kindle than if I had purchased a paperback.  Sorry Sylvia Day but I will not be purchasing any more of your books.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Such a wonderful movie.  My kids and I could watch it over and over again.  By far one of the best Disney Princess movies.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I had very high expectations for this book, and thus I am left with a bit of a disappointed feeling. I hope, for once, that the film is better.
B006PTZNSY|4.0|I like the music but not all the songs.  There is nothing wrong with this just my taste and usually that is how it goes, buy a cd and only like 3 of the songs.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Bought the CD and DVD.  Great recording of one of the best rock bands of all time! Even 27 years after the band broke up, they still know how to rock the house!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I love all their music, and this was no exception.  Touches my heart - inspires me.  And most of all, I just love excellence, and have never heard anything less than that from Il Divo.
B009157BWU|5.0|very cute for the younger kids, the amount of commitment on the part of the crew must have been emense!!!
B008KW43TE|5.0|THIS CD TAKES A FEW LISTENS BEFORE YOU REALLY GET INTO IT!!! I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY $3.99 AT THE TIME. I ALSO LOVE HIS SONG...THINKIN BOUT U!!!!!!!!!
B001GM28HO|5.0|Got to like the Gaga.  Good songs, good beats.  The only problem is my kids took it and I have not been able to find it since.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. It was more energetic than the original series, while still maintaining the aspects that made it great.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love the Patricia Cornwell books and will read everyone I can.  As usual it doesn't disapoint and I'm very glad I got it.  On to the next one.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|super funny great holiday movie (with some quirks like real life) who doesn't like Chevy Chase ? if you don't then don't watch this!!!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I LOVE RIRI.....AND I AM CONSTANTLY PLAYING HER CD........THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE! GO AHEAD AND ORDER YOURS NOW!
B009DJB9HC|3.0|Ex<br />cell  band...especially joe Bonnamasa on guitar.But their first cd is still the best.I also recomend the live over Europe cd.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Seriously.  The single worst movie I've ever seen with the worst performance by an animated character. (kudos for the animators though)  Just to be clear - no, the language didn't bother me - been know to drop the F-bomb more than once myself...okay twice...okay, okay, too many times to count.  I simply didn't find anything remotely clever, romantic, heartrending (Hey, I almost smiled when the little furface was disemboweled.), or just plain funny about what could have been a great concept.  Could have been.  Failed miserably.  Think of it this way - watch family guy with ONLY Peter - No Meg, Stewie or Brian...not even those other ones - just a weird Boston accented manboy.  If you think that would be hilarious...then knock yourself out on Ted.  Otherwise....yaaaaawwwwnnnnnnnnn!  Take a nap...you'll enjoy it more.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I do not like the sound effects at all. I really doubt the necessity of this kind of noise bombarding our children, who are the ones who really spend time on this app.  Too irritating, anoying, clamoring, - adjectives that come to mind in describing the noise.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|interesting concept the book was better but it was still well done for such an out of the ordanary idea
B006IGZX0C|1.0|This movie was such disappointing execution of a great book. It was as if the screenwriters didn't know they'd have to leave something out of the movie. Felt like ALL the characters got short shrift and, in some cases, were not represented as they were in the book.<br /><br />I think most of the actors did a great job with their parts but their parts paled compared to the book versions of them. It made me mad to see this win awards.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|great sound quality. i love these headphones.<br />I take them with me everywhere.<br />they help me focus on my work when i'm in noisy or distracting places.
1781161313|5.0|This truly is the gold standard of science fiction technical manuals. Everything in this book is incredibly well researched. The science is outstananding, fascinating, and probable. It takes the alien franchise to hard science fiction hights that would make Asimov and Clarke (and especially Heinlein) proud. The science in this is great. The chapter on starship to starship combat is especially thrilling. Instead of the static naval battles of star trek or the dogfights of star wars, these battles are how it would actually go down. My jaw dropped. &#34;this is so realistic!&#34; It truly is realistic. It brings an entirely new dimension to the alien franchise. All of the weapons are incredibly badass, the ships are awesome. Everything you want to know about the alien franchise (except for prometheus) is contained in this volume. Everything about the colonial marines, everything about the xenomorph biology (also well handled), the nostromo, the power loader that Ripley used to shove the high queen b*tch of the xenomorphs out an airlock, and the USS Sulaco, the atmosphere processors...and that's hardly scratching the surface. There's really cool stuff in here that weren't even in the films. Even better than the star trek manuals, star wars manuals. This is the ultimate highest bar of science fiction technical manuals. Not to mention the illustrations...oh how wonderfully detailed! And when reading it, it feels like a real technical manual from the military. It feels like it was written in the alien universe!  It also contains deep social commentary about corporations, war, and even some parallels to Vietnam. Everyone must read this... if your a science buff, a military buff, a science fiction buff, a gun junkie, and if your an alien fan then reading this book should be on your bucket list. in other words, buy it now. Quit wasting time reading reviews, and pick it up. I promise you won't regret it.
B002ZG999U|5.0|my husband loves this movie and cant wait for the next one to come out (expendables 2)... he loves action/comedies....and sylvester stallone fan! highly recommend this movie, what a great buy!
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is a gift for my son who was just elected president of his fraternity. I'd give this movie 6 stars if that was possible.  I miss Belushi.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham always delivers an exciting story that you can not put down...only wish he were more prolific.  This was very good.
0307887960|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing the result of others that had used the Dukan plan. I read the book completely and determined that the recommendations were sensible and not onerous. I also like that the foods that are recommended are not part of a menu plan, but items that one would usually purchase at the grocery store.<br /><br />After several months and about forty pounds later, I am headed into phase four and am very pleased.<br /><br />I think of the Dukan plan not as a diet, but a good lifestyle change.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We were gone on vacation with no dvr. We knew we were gonna miss an important episode both my wife and I love. We found amazon never using this service before in no time we were sitting watching our favorite show you made our night thx.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|In this first season, we're introduced to CSI: LA.  Chris O'Donnell stars a G Callen and LL Cool J as Sam Hanna - partners chasing bad guys, who commit crimes against the military. Los Angeles provides a fantastic background as G and Sam often race against the clock to bring the criminals to justice. I recommend this first season as a great addition to anyone's personal library.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best apps ever. My only problem is that its not as upgraded as the Pc or Xbox (I have both), but I know this will change soon. Great job Mojang! Keep up the great work!
B000C8VE14|5.0|It was packaged super nicely, arrived on time, sounds amazing, was a perfect birthday gift for my love. Very good gift.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not read books. This book kept me on the edge the whole time. I found myself hurrying to get to the next page.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Its a superhero movie with a classic touch!. Music, visual, Tom Hardy & Gary Oldman are superb!, Thanks Nolan !!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Picture is just as good in this streaming video as when I saw it at the theatre. If you've read Susanne Collins first book in the Hunger Games series, this movie does it justice.
B000I9WW3G|5.0|i love the way Erin won't take you can't do that and make it happen . She needed the monitary gain for her family but got personal gain in the bargin... You go girl!
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I am not using this Kindle cover as purchased. I am a leather worker and wanted to make my wife a new cover for her kindle but did not have all of the materials I needed. So I bought this one and took it apart. I found it to be very well made and durable.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Tutorial is awful and the interface is not intuitive. the game plays 30 second video ads every minute so its unplayable for the most part
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|This memory card holds many pictures but it lacked something because it wouldn't lock in place inside my digital camera.  I was able to shut my camera, and once it's shut, it helps to hold the picture card in place. Otherwise, no complaints.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|i LOVED this movie. Wrath of the Titans was even better than the first i think. awesome. hope they do another one.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a really fun game and highly addicting as well. I wish there was more to play. The only complaint I have is that there is a lot of back and forth between scenes that gets a little annoying. Overall though great game.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Includes 3 Original Beetlejuice cartoons in the extras, but no behind the scenes footage. I &#60;3 this movie, Tim Burton, stop-motion animation & gore. This is an all-time classic everyone who knows anything should have in their collection. I've already watched it 5 times since I received it speedily in its padded-secure box &#60;3

B00338QENI|4.0|I did enjoy this book but at times I found some of the author's efforts to explain the relatively simple science underlying the story to be a little dry.  Still it is an important story.
B00009R86L|5.0|Just received this pad and strapped it onto my one inch wide unpadded leather shoulder strap.  Outstanding.  The angled pad allows for a more perfect fit around the shoulder and collar bone.  Other buyers here don't like the beige colored rubber.  It's not a big cosmetic issue for me.  A true non-slip and very comfortable shoulder pad were my primary reasons for this purchase.  I'll definitely buy more in the future.

B009E3EY38|5.0|My review didn't take fourteen words or more, so this here is the review you will get from me :
B00A50PE6K|4.0|For the third year in a row, the cast of Glee has released a Christmas album which features songs that are aired on the winter season finale of the series. The problem I have with the album and the previous ones is that there are no original songs on it. I have heard each and every song over and over again on radio stations and movies.<br /><br />I will give the singers (or should I say actors) credit for singing the songs traditionally. Everyone sings the songs well, but only a few stood out for me. Silent Night, The First Noel, and Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah are my favorites.<br /><br />The Complete Track list:<br /><br />1. Jingle Bell Rock - (Chord Overstreet)<br /><br />2. White Christmas - (Darren Criss and Chris Colfer)<br /><br />3. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - (Mark Salling, Jacob Artist, Chord Overstreet, Heather Morris, Darren Criss, Chris Colfer, and Melissa Benoist)<br /><br />4. Silent Night - (Naya Rivers)<br /><br />5. Joy To The World - (Alex Newell)<br /><br />6. The First Noel - (Melissa Benoist)<br /><br />7. I'll Be Home For Christmas - (Lea Michele)<br /><br />8. Feliz Navidad - (Kevin McHale)<br /><br />9. Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah - (Jacob Artist and Mark Salling)<br /><br />10. Happy Xmas (War Is Over) - (Cory Monteith)
B000OT8GCQ|2.0|I was hoping to like this book since of course the Notebook by Nicholas Sparks was such a huge success. This book was very one dimensional and elementary. The book was predictable and the characters became annoying after awhile because they were so whiny. Perhaps this is Nicholas Sparks style, but if you are looking for an interesting, unpredictable love story that wasn't written for a 13 year old, this isn't for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was so good! Surprising and very interesting, I couldn't put down my kindle! New favorite book. Now to read the next one...
0802473156|4.0|I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time, as I'm one of those people whose love language isn't obvious. The chapters on the five languages themselves were very satisfying and helpful (except for physical touch, which mentioned the obvious point that it isn't all sexual yet failed to really expand on that) and I walked away feeling much more certain. Some of the chapters afterward were helpful, but I didn't feel compelled to read them as in-depth. His approach isn't the end-all-be-all to a happy relationship, but I believe it's a huge part of it.<br /><br />Though Chapman writes the book from a Christian point of view and religion does play an appropriately heavy role, I would step out on a limb and recommend this book to non-Christians as well. The basic premise remains the same regardless of your faith or non-faith and it would be a shame to miss out on such an eye-opening concept just because of that.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This 1946 classic is aired annually on NBC, but I didn't watch it until the mid-90s when the country singer Garth Brooks was the host of it. I absolutely loved it and eventually bought the movie on VHS at a Best Buy the following summer. I later replaced it with the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD. To me, the movie is fast-paced despite its 130 minutes running time, and gives a great message.
B007URCTOG|4.0|This was a nice story and we need that now days. Saw the real people on Today show and they said it was all pretty close to the exact story.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|The original 1937 version of Miracle on 34th Street is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. It's played every December multiple times, but normally in the added color version, which ruins the film for me. It had been a few years since I seen the movie as my VHS version died years ago, but I ended up buying it on DVD, which includes the b&w and the colorized version, along with the 1955 TV-remake. Yes, the movie does gives the message that Santa is real, which may bother some people, but it is a harmless film that has great actors and dialogue.

B0084TWN9K|5.0|As always, Alice Munro's writing is impeccable; and her narratives weave together characters and themes in completely original ways. And as always, the stories are sad and bleak.  I don't think this is her best, but even her second best is better than most writers.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|I remember going with my parents and grandparents to see Christmas Vacation at the theater back in 1989 (Just writing this makes me feel old.). It is the third film out four of the National Lampoon Vacation series and it is the best out of the sequels. It later spawned a spin-off sequel with Cousin Eddie, but it was dreadful to watch. Christmas Vacation is played to death thanks to CMT and Comedy Central. I would rather watch the unedited version on DVD.

B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I'm not the biggest country music fan, but I have enjoyed watching Nashville each week, so naturally I bought the soundtrack.<br /><br />Why did I give it only four stars?<br /><br />Well, it is missing the best song, Fade Into You, from the series! I wonder why it wasn't included! Maybe it was only on the deluxe version that I saw in a Target ad. The problem is that I don't have a Target near by. It would have been nice it the producers released all 29 songs from the first eight episodes onto a two-disc set.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the eleven songs that are on the Volume One Soundtrack.<br /><br />The Complete Track List:<br /><br />1. Buried Under (3:03/ Connie Britton)<br /><br />2. If I Didn't Know Better (2:57/ Sam Palladio, Clare Bowen)<br /><br />3. Undermine (3:59/ Hayden Panettiere, Charles Esten)<br /><br />4. Sideshow (3:03/ Charles Esten)<br /><br />5. Wrong Song (3:10/ Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere)<br /><br />6. No One Will Every Love You (3:42/ Connie Britton, Charles Esten)<br /><br />7. Twist of Barbwire (3:04/ Jonthan Jackson)<br /><br />8. Love Like Mine (3:22/ Hayden Panettiere)<br /><br />9. Telescope (2:27/ Lennon Stella, Maisy Stella)<br /><br />10.

1442419814|1.0|I must say for starters that I am 38, so maybe this book is for teens only. I have read other YA novels which I enjoyed (like the Twilight Saga or The Hunger Games) but this was hard to finish. A huge disappointment. Characters are shallow and unrealistic. You don´t get to connect with them. There are no surprises, you can tell what is going to happen from minute 1. Just Terrible.
B0054N73EY|5.0|I admit, I slept on this when it came out but it is really a great album.  I miss JF's guitar and harmony but still a strong album.
1609613937|4.0|Enjoyed the update version of McDougall's original weight loss book, and I always enjoy the testimonies. However, I could have done without the crusade for animals and sea life. I know these things have their place but I just don't think it is appropriate when we are talking about health and the benefits of eating a plant based diet.
0316069434|5.0|Really enjoyed this Harry Bosch novel. I found it to be one of Connelly's best of this series.  Loved it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|great but not if you want to play on your own,  otherwise you'll be spending a lot of money because you can earn gems unless you level up and even then you only get one for every new level.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I'm no great literary critic, but I liked this book. It was well worth the bargain \\"special offer\\" price that Amazon offered for it for my Kindle. I liked the twist at the end and its slow reveal. There are some plot elements which don't really work, but overall it was a fun read.
B009KHCT94|2.0|For me this movie failed to be sufficiently funny, have good CGI graphics, or have sufficient action scenes.  The politically driven undertones are strong and difficult to ignore, though not pro-Nazi by any means.  Also it is never explained why there is earth-like gravity on the moon.  The movie seemed like a parody or spoof of movie that has never been made.
1582701709|5.0|This book plants the seed into thinking about the universe and how positive thoughts can change your life.  Stop thinking bad things, stop thinking \\"Why me?\\" and put that energy into positive things and positive thoughts.  When you do this you will find the universe will reward you with personal wealth, and happiness.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|my fiance wanted the movie so we got it for him. he thought it was a cute funny movie you could watch with the whole family
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love every song on this album and listen to them over and over. Wonderful lyrics with great rock/jazz/blues/pop sound.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars but for two things.<br />1. Possibly be given &#34;lives&#34; so when you fail a level, you can retry instead of having to start over.<br />2. There should be explainations as to what each special bubble does and how you can win it.<br />Otherwise this game is loads of fun and very addicting!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Stallone, Willis, Schwartznegger, Norris, Van Damme.... need I say more. This is an awesome movie with the best action heros who has ever done it. Looking forward to a trilogy!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you beat all the levels with 3 stars, it unlocks the third world (Walk of the Jedi) for free. I personally think it's worth the $3.00!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just when I think there is a resolution and the story can set itself and progress the writers add another twist to keep things interesting. Can't wait until the rest of the season returns
B008YWY0HK|2.0|This offering is intended for an audience to run through in a light hearted manner, but it bored me silly. I was lost in the silly girl in quest of changing her mother's mind to the wild extreme of making a deal with a witch and turning her mother into a bear, sorry it just did not resonate for me.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|This was supposed to be a sequel worth watching but it was sooooooo BORING!! It is because i love Greek Mythology that I gave this movie 2 stars and not one :(

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I started this series after reading the Shades of Grey trilogy thinking that it would be more of the same.  It took me a while to really get into the first book because I was looking for more of the same juicy plot and salacious sex scenes.  But once I really got into the first book, I was not able to put it down.  The plot was more believable, the detailing of the sex scenes much more engaging and the back and forth between Eva and Gideon made you want to pull your hair out until you got to the very end. I absolutely cannot wait until May until the third of this series is out.  What am I going to do for the next 6 months?  Overall, I would not try to make any comparisons with this book series and the Shades series.  Two very good reads both in their own rights.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was sure I would not like this book, but was I surprised.  I love it.  Give us MORE and MORE of the Ana and Christian story.  A trilogy is not enough.

B0056TYT66|5.0|I wanted a combo SATA III and USB3 card and stumbled onto this adapter. Since my ASUS motherboard does not support USB3 nor SATA III, I needed the card to connect a 3TB HDD and a SATA III SSD.  I was hesitant about whether the adapter card would work after reading the reviews, but decided to give it a try.  It installed with no problem and the system promptly recognized it.<br /><br />I must say the driver was not easy to find and did take a long time to download (20 minutes) over cable internet from the Transcend website.  The driver did install without a problem after the download completed.  I did not &#34;ding&#34; he rating because of the driver download.<br /><br />How crazy fast is this card?  My system now boots in 10s of seconds as compared to over a minute before.  I backed up 56 GB of data from the internal eSATA III SSD to the internal eSATA III HDD in less than 9 minutes, including data compression!
B007XHWROK|3.0|Believe, an album released on the year Justin Bieber turned 18 years of age, logically matches the pop-star's adult age and voice to a more contemporary, young adult sound, aimed towards much of the audience of the current radio-oriented chart pop music. The results are albeit more in tune with the musical trends of the aforementioned genre, making spotlight of the singer's voice, which has now settled into a low key tenor, while sitting semi-comfortably within the producer paradise background of the likes of Max Martin, Mike Posner, and over a dozen others.<br /><br />Now Bieber may hold the brand name recognition of the album, but his voice and personality hardly shine on any of the songs; worst of all it's somehow bizarrely beneficial for the sake of his marketing that his matured vocals cannot be immediately associated to Bieber as his originally high pitch vocals on his teen heyday used to be, but they nonetheless come off as hardly noteworthy.<br /><br />Judging by the singer's aforementioned quality, it's no surprise when the producers take the spotlight with the albeit glossy hooks and melodies that prevail the record, and given that almost no producer or composer collaborated in more than one track, there is a great variety of production styles to pick and choose from, most of which measure up beyond the often flat quality of Bieber's singing. It is because of them that a reasonable portion of the songs have the most stand-alone worthy quality in both singles and non-singles, where there are strong moments to be found in the loud, noise-gated trance synths of  'Beauty And The Beat' and 'As Long As You Love Me', or more simple acoustic blends of guitar in the Air Supply-ish ballad 'Catching Feelings' (a style of ballad production which is nowhere to be found nowadays).<br /><br />The other side of the coin, however, showcases that the rotating roles of the producers leaves holes, and occasionally flat out weak material in the album (The hit single 'Boyfriend' is easily among them), and the overall qualities that all the songs in Believe share are not particularly good ones, such as excessive compression, predictable filters, and pervasive use of melodine. One might argue that these are all common production techniques in today's pop music market, not exclusive to the record, but nonetheless these are, and will always be, unimpressive, lazy techniques not for the benefit of the audio product.<br /><br />So at the end of the day, Believe is an album that points Beiber towards a more mature audience, a sound marketing strategy from his publicists that has been seen before much too often (remember Justin Timberlake's solo breakthrough 'Justified'? it's so similar in approach to Believe it goes right down to the album's name), and while the dozens of producers shine and save the album from dull flatness, one is left to wonder whether their approach is due to commercial expectations, or plain lack of talent from the singer.' is easily among them), and the overall qualities that all the songs in Believe share are not particularly good ones, such as excessive compression, predictable filters, and pervasive use of melodine.

B009OA57MI|5.0|This game is really fun and quite challenging at times. There are so many different missions and each one is quite different from the next. It appears that all the problems that reviewers have are when using this app with the Kindle Fire. I'm on a Droid Bionic and it couldn't be running more perfect. Well worth the price if you love fighter jets! Only wish for the developer is for this game to allow you to fly back to the carrier or airport and resupply your weapons. Keep up the good work.

B007N9FKCY|5.0|Exceptionally fun game with good graphics, music and sound effects. Colorful and nicely detailed screens for a retro style old Mario/Commander Keen type game. This game is a platformer so your \\"Bean\\" can go left and right or jump up, down and all around to collect jewels and stomp baddies. Smooth gameplay is made more interesting because while jumping \\"Bean\\" must avoid spikes, push & roll things, and spin girders to achieve his goals. Controls are spot on and easy to use. Completing a level unlocks the next level. If you die you go back to the last save checkpoint which is never too far back.  Two things I especially liked is that while Bean must move ahead to complete the level, he can also bounce in place(without moving forward or backward) while you consider your next move and he can also change direction in mid-air.<br /><br />Statistics are displayed at the end of each level. There are three goals(badges) per level: to collect all the jewels, to complete the level with the least amount of jumps(there is a \\"par\\" number of jumps to achieve), and to find your missing pet cat axolotls. Good replay because achieving all the goals requires multiple playthroughs. The levels are not timed, which I like.<br /><br />Well organized menu system to easily get you in and out of the game. There is a level select option to let you replay levels or just continue your current game. You also have an option in the settings menu to control the placement of the right/left controls(4 different options: 2 separated controls buttons as well as right, left or middle placement of a combined control pad). Bean's Quest also has an actual \\"Exit Game\\" button which is on the Level Select screen.<br /><br />I almost didn't download this, but I'm glad I did. Some levels are hard and I will never complete them in the \\"par\\" number of jumps but I know my nephew will breeze right through this. Timing is a factor in stomping your enemies. Experiment with the placement of the touch screen controls to find which one works best for you; it can make the difference between finding this game fun or frustrating. If you do find the game silly, frustrating or too challenging, your kids certainly won't. Grab it for them. This is one that could keep them occupied with a family friendly game for hours.<br /><br />There are links to Facebook, Twitter and the developer's website to buy the music album, but there are no permissions.<br /><br />This single player game is well designed and implemented with good physics. It has lots of levels, good variety in challenges, and cute little characters & monsters. Totally fun and enjoyable to play. It's not just a kid's game. But if this is not the style of game you like to play you probably won't like it. It's not for everyone.

B0076DELIG|1.0|It was too detailed and rather slow. I'm very disappionted in the story line.  It's normally faster and gets to the clues better. Mr. Connelly maybe should rethink the boredom readers may have with all the logistics of different agencies and learned understanding of CSU or other depts. we are after all in 2012 with TV and previous books.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|I have found it to be a great game and very addictive, but I am having a hard time knowing what I am doing. I'm not sure how to obtain additional points or why sometimes some of the bubbles--of other colors-drop and sometimes they don't. The game has frozen up on me several times and when I loose a round the program won't automatically go back to the beginning, I have to close the entire program, go to settings, open up the program and go through the short/brief explanation of the game.<br />Like I said , I do like the game and I'm sure that these are small glitches in it. I am hoping the more I play the more I will understand.  It is very addictive .... I will conquer it !!  :)
B007UXTG8M|4.0|This is a pretty good movie about sexual addiction of a guy in NYC. And it digs a little bit into the psychology of such a person and his subsequent emotional problems, some related violence and resulting guilt. This is a NC17 movie for obvious reasons.
B00005JKL8|5.0|excellent movie...best of the performances, amazing real time war depictions. Undoubtedly one of the best. A must buy.......for all the war movie buff's

B001TLZRZW|5.0|This is a really killer album from LoG. Most people didn't like Randy having more melodic singing on an album, but it shows they can change up things a little, but not lose their real sound. This is definately an album you should get.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This film was entertaining, with impressive action sequences and a generally worth watching. That said, elements of the story line were poorly explained (including the motivation for being evil) and the whole thing was about half an hour too long.
0691130272|1.0|I report on the first edition, as nothing would induce me to buy the second.<br /><br />Crank theories, unfounded in observation, are to be expected from crackpots. They are not important and no one takes them seriously. This book is much worse, because it comes from prominent professors at leading institutions, and masquerades as real science under a heavy disguise of intimidating formulae, used to confuse and bamboozle countless students and the astronomical community at large. This is a classic example of The Emperor's New Clothes. If the treatments are intimidating enough they will blind the reader to the authors' lack of understanding, and no one will dare challenge them for fear of appearing not to have the mathematical skills to follow them. But if one takes the trouble to study the equations, one finds that very few of them have any relevance to real galaxies. In over five years of active research in this field I have scarcely found reason to refer to this book, and when I do I find mistakes and misconceptions obscured by unclear text and unnecessarily complicated formulae.<br /><br />The Oort constants are introduced in chapter 1, without any discussion of what they mean or of whether they have any meaning at all in a real spiral galaxy. Values are plucked out of the air, although data on stellar kinematics at time of writing was sparse and inaccurate (this was written before Hipparcos and very few radial velocities were measured).<br /><br />Things get worse in Chapter 2, on potential theory. The authors fill the formulae with unnecessary complication, and fail even to explain what it means to say that force is gradient of potential (it is not just the use of the grad symbol in an equation, and nor is it simpler to think of a scalar field, since it is required to think of the gradient of the potential). All they really need to say is that we are dealing with a many body problem in which we can only approximately know the potential, that therefore we can only give numerical and approximate solutions; intimidating formulae are thus irrelevant. As a treatise on numerical methods this book falls at the first hurdle, because it gives no quantitative analysis of discretisation errors. Without such an analysis, there is no way to say whether a numerical solution is valid.<br /><br />In a proper, scientific, use of mathematics, equations abstract from reality that which is essential to a solution, achieving simplification by omitting what is not essential. The authors do precisely the opposite, complicating treatments by inappropriate use of methods designed to solve other problems, and finding only solutions to non-physical potentials. There should be some reason for the choice of a mathematical method, other than randomly scratching around with formulae to see what happens, especially when methods of this sort can produce unpredictable and incorrect results in consequence of the approximations inherent in any treatment.<br /><br />In chapter 3 the authors describe epicycles, a method which harks back to Ptolemy. One could find a first order approximation for precession in a axisymmetric galaxy using Lindblad's epicycles, but the Milky way is a spiral galaxy and there is no prospect such an analysis could work. At last they observe that the Milky Way is not axisymmetric, but then they spend the rest of chapter 3 studying orbits in other unreal potentials.<br /><br />Moving rapidly on to chapter six, we at last meet with spiral structure. Here we find the winding problem, in which Lindblad tried to think of a galaxy as though it were a solid object, coming to the remarkable insight that you can't. Then there is the hypothesis of Lin and Shu that spiral structure can be explained as a density wave, \\"a wavelike oscillation that propagates through the disk in much the same way that waves propagate through violin strings or over the ocean surface\\", and the attempt to study the disc with the methods of wave mechanics. But wave mechanics applies to elastic media; to apply it to a galaxy, there would have to be a substantial repulsive force acting between stars which approach each other too closely. Someone should have told them that gravity is attractive.<br /><br />The concept of \\"heat\\" applies just as well to random motions of stars as it does to particles in a gas. Galaxies formed soon after the very hot conditions of the big bang. The time scale for Galactic evolution is given by the orbital period of stars. For stars orbiting at about the Solar radius, there has fewer than 100 orbits since formation. Damping forces (\\"dynamical friction\\") due to gravitational interaction with other stars are low at the distances between stars, so we should expect older stars to have \\"hotter\\", i.e. more eccentric, orbits. This is exactly as observed, but the authors take this as evidence that the Galaxy is heating up over time, and spend section 7.5 trying to come up with mechanisms to defeat the laws of thermodynamics.<br /><br />In this book, astrophysics has truly entered the world of fantasy. It has been called \\"A true bible on astrophysics\\". This underlines the fact that this is not a work of science. Science, unlike religion, depends on observation, not authority.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Hi Amazon, this is HELEN FERRIMAN not Lee - my husband does not do the purchasing of music !! I saw the 2cellos at the Elton John Concert here in Perth - they are amazing. I just love their music & their innovative style. I bought two CD's one for my office as background music & one for a friend who plays the Cello for Christmas. I wish them well in their prospective careers, I'm sure I speak for most of the audience at the concert they are indeed a breath of fresh air to the norm. Good on Elton for discovering them & taking them on his world tour.
B009DP9D6A|3.0|Has some pretty good tracks on it. Though it aslso has a few that you wonder if the song was finished, and a couple others that you start begging for the intro to be over. Not as good as some of his previous work, but still a good album.

159420411X|5.0|This book puts into perspective the difference when trying to predict outcomes the difference between the signal and the noise that impacts all of our thinking. Nat is a genius about recognizing how to agregate polling and predictions and use alogarithms to come closer to an independent evaluation of projections. I loved how his success rate for the 2008 and 2012 elections were so well done. The concepts flow into our own lives in how we can discern the noise that is in our own brain that distorts our ability to make better decisions and predictions of outcomes. I highly recommend Nate Silver. He is a genius.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked it because it kept me in the dark throughout the read.  Cleverly done and executed superbly.<br />Sid Wugalter
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I am a solid fan of this whole series.  Season 4 is more dark and complex as Morgana becomes more powerful and Merlin becomes more confident.  King Arthur becomes the king he wants to be.  It is such a great family series.  The humor is wonderful, the friendship between Guis and Merlin is wonderful and very satisfying.  The language is of a higher caliber than any of the American sitcoms.  There may be a &#34;hell&#34; or &#34;idiot&#34; used occasionally but that is the strongest language.  The knights are very noble.  It is a series that is thrilling from season 1, the characters are strong throughout and each season becomes more and more compelling.  I think it is the best series on TV!

020161622X|5.0|This books is phenomenal for beginner and intermediate programmers alike. I got it while starting a learn from home learning crave, and it was the best asset I could have gotten. It focuses on more than just skill and note taking (which 90% of programming books are about). This book works on many things, and tries to get multiple aspects of programming/Structure, organization, and pragmatism in your head to help.<br /><br />It has examples galore and is incredibly easy to read. It has been all over the net as the GO-TO book for programmers. Sometimes as a programmer, you work some much on your projects you forget to have some thought out dialog on methods, and the book pokes fun at it a bit. It goes in at points to talk about the depth and methodology to programming as a whole, giving you arguments for varying opinions.<br /><br />A+. Any programmer should get it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I have watched and enjoyed all three Walking Dead seasons, but Season 3 is definitely the best in my opinion. What makes Season 3 the best you may ask? Compared to Seasons 1 and 2, Season 3 has more activity, action, story, gore (a big plus in my mind), effects, intriguing characters, locales, etc. The improvement list goes on and on. If you love zombies, quality acting, and a good storyline, Walking Dead Season 3 is the right fit for you.
0345803485|1.0|Just...don't buy it. It is horribly written and has a lack of originality. This is also just a very gross book.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was okay, but I did't like it as much as the others in the series.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were nice additions. There was less Batman than you'd expect in a \\"Batman\\" movie.  It was a little long. Plenty of action. I'd still recommend it.
0545265355|4.0|I like it.<br /><br />I bought this book as a gift to my niece. it is one of the books kids/adults are crazy about nowadays.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I already loved this movie. It's nice to watch it in HD for the first time and now I have ALL the bonus features instead of just a few on the DVD version. Worth the money if you absolutely love the movie and/or comics.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|This book is very well written and the idea of the tale is interesting  but the content is excessively depressing. I personally don't like to read a book to be constantly reminded of disease, death and guilt

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was always a Star Wars fan... Since I can remember, I even wanted to be a Jedi knight.... To use a light saber.... To control the force.... But then I grew up and found out those things only happen in movies.... Too bad!<br />I had the 2004 DVD edition of the Star Wars saga and as soon as the blu-ray version came out I wanted to buy it. I finally did. My opinion:<br /><br />The video:<br />Amazing 1080p full HD video... The colors are just right! The video plays smooth even during the fastest action scenes... This is the best picture ever (I just didn't see the 4k displays yet)... I could notice no movie grain, even while watching the first 3 movies.... The whole saga was remastered to achieve the most out of blu-ray format. Speaking of video quality, it's way better than the DVD edition I had. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The sound:<br />Definitely the best audio ever.... The surround effects are just amazing! One can hear all the things happening around theirselves.... The sound really provides a really immersive experience while watching the movies. The acclaimed soundtrack feels even better... The scores really build up the mood for the different scenes of all 6 movies. It's a unique experience.<br /><br />The packaging:<br />This edition really have a wonderful packaging. The discs are stored inside a book, with really thick pages, all filled with pictures related to each film. The art itself is really well-made. Is was delighted when I first opened the box and saw the care taken to design and print this set. The overall presentation is really good.<br />Despite all the compliments made to the art, I just didn't like the way the discs are stored. There's no way to take a disc out of the \\"book\\" without risking to touch the data surface of the discs. This is a minor problem, since Blu-ray Discs have a scratch protection coating, but I just didn't like it at all. I really take good care of my movies and I just hate when you can see a fingerprint on thediscs. Because of that, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The story:<br />Lucas did a great job writing the Star Wars saga.... The story is really interesting, he can keep your curiosity and attention during almost all of the movies.... I just couldn't avoid falling asleep during the Attack of the Clones romantic scenes.... I just think these scenes were too long for the style of the series. There could be some romance on the series, but not that much.... As of the other films, I just love them. Even though I love the original trilogy, I just couldn't notice that the light saber fights got really improved in the newer movies. A sure 5 out of 5 star rating.<br /><br />The changes made:<br />I think I didn't notice all the changes made since the DVD version of these movies. I just think that the CG Yoda is way better than the old puppet one....as this is a matter of opinion, I won't discuss it here.... There are fans who hated the changes and fans that think they came for the better..... I would rate them 5 out of 5, but that's just my personal opinion.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I just love these films.... I would totally rate them 4 out of 5....<br />If you're a fan, you should buy this set.... If you're not a fan, but you like starship movies, give this a try... You won't regret it....<br />Lets see what Disney will do with the saga.... Lets hope the 7th installment is as good as the first 6..... Two bad these are not 3D movies.... But I don't really think I'll buy the digitally 3d-fied movies... I only like native 3D movies....

0544045203|5.0|I found this allegorical novel so compelling, so delightful, so well written, and such a paradoxical mix of sacred-profane and earnest-lighthearted that I was blown away. In my view, it deserves a ten-star rating.<br /><br />Despite rave reviews, I didn't read it when it first came out because I thought the plot sounded contrived: for 227 days a teenage boy drifts across the Pacific in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger and both survive. While the plot is bizarre, it works. And it works because Martel is a magician--a masterful storyteller who has thought-provoking things to say about one of life's central themes: the relationship between the stories we tell or choose to believe and our quality of life.<br /><br />In an interview, Martel said the novel's theme could be summarized in three lines: \\"Life is a story. You can choose your story. And a story with an imaginative overlay is the better story.\\"  On page 302, Pi himself explains: \\"The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn't that make life a story?\\"<br /><br />Another theme linked to story is whether we choose to believe in the phenomenon called God. Martel explores this in many ways. For example, on page 64 Pi says:<br /><br />\\"I can well imagine an atheist's last words: 'White, white! L-L-Love! My God!'--and the deathbed leap of faith. Whereas the agnostic, if he stays true to his reasonable self, if he stays beholden to dry, yeastless factuality, might try to explain the warm light bathing him by saying, 'Possibly a f-f-failing oxygenation of the b-b-brain,' and to the very end, lack the imagination and miss the better story.\\"<br /><br />On page 64 Pi also touches on the uses of adversity like sharing a small boat with a huge and oddly named tiger: \\"I will tell you a secret: a part of me was glad about Richard Parker. A part of me did not want Richard Parker to die at all, because if he died I would be left alone with despair, a foe even more formidable than a tiger.\\"<br /><br />I saw Ang Lee's excellent movie adaptation before I read the book and was glad I did for two reasons. First, it made the shipboard arrangements easier to follow. Without having seen the movie, I might have had trouble visualizing the lifeboat's set-up. Second, although you know from the get-go that Pi survives, knowing more about the plot allowed me to focus on the book's wonderful writing. Beyond the poetic and philosophical richness of his words, Martel's use of language was positively symphonic. Sometimes all the orchestra's instruments were involved. Sometimes only a section or two played. At other times a soloist carried the narrative--especially in short chapters or the list-like sections Martel used to vary tempo and narrative style. For examples of such lists, see \\"The paperwork was colossal.\\" etc. (page 89); all of Chapter 71 (202-205); \\"Everything suffered.\\" etc. (238); and \\"I clung to life.\\" etc. (241).<br /><br />Beyond that, the warmth of Pi's voice--with its unique mix of earnestness and humor--made his character so appealing that I was sad when the book ended. I will miss his company until I read the book again.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The video and audio was beautifully restored.  one of the best remastered classics.  The remastered version is almost better than most modern day movies. you just have to see it to believe it. the video is vibrant yet still retains that film feel. the video seems almost 3d and the audio feels live. much better than the old 5 Star Collection dvd set.<br /><br />the extras are great too. it includes most if not all of the content of the 5 Star Collection edition of Sound of Music.<br /><br />The only slight downer was that the music box seems a little fast on the tempo.
B008518MOW|5.0|They always tried to tell me it was the drugs or the war but know I know the truth; it was Agents J (Will Smith).<br /><br />Yes it was more of the same as the first two productions.  It is not easy trying to top the original movie let along making something coherent and excel with new one-liners.<br /><br />Yes why not time travel, revenge, and evil. Who would ever expect something hidden in a cake being brought into the jail?<br /><br />I will not go into detail as that is the fun of the movie as secrets review themselves. I was really surprised to see anyone pull off a young agent K; Josh Brolin pulled it off quite well.<br /><br />If there be a MIB 4 I\\"ll be there.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is not for those who believe that matter is all there is to existence.  I for one believe that we are much more than matter.  Science is but one way of knowing.  I've read Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Moody and many other researchers into near death experiences.  I believe that their conclusions as to the experience are valid.  Now we have someone, a neuroscientist/surgeon who has done a 180 on the subject after his own NDE.  His opinions on the subject are worth our attention.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|My family LOVES this movie...great actors and the scenery is wonderful to watch. It makes a wonderful gift to others!
630460291X|3.0|Quick delivery. Unfortunately it's a two sided disc. One side has 75 mins of the movie the other side has the remaining portion of the movie. Made watching the movie annoying bc you have to flip the disc halfway thru the movie.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I love this series. This second book maybe more than the first, as it is more a survival type book. I love the characters and the plot. I love the poetry and arts alluded to.<br /><br />Once again, this is borrowed from the library. The first book I read using Overdrive to listen and Adobe Digital Editions to read. Since that background hurt my eyes I more or less used it when I didn't understand the words the narrator spoke. In this case, the second book, I was able to borrow the Kindle version. That is much easier for me to read. But I refuse to buy these books at $10 and $11 a pop and not be able to lend them to friends as I would be able to with tree versions. I have the third in the series on hold. This time the library only has the CD and a hardback copy. Wish the library had just the Kindle versions. But it is for everything in this paragraph that this book, or the series won't get five stars as I believe the author deserves for her wonderful stories.<br /><br />I would still recommend these books for anyone from pre-teen on up. I think that they could be read aloud or listened to on CD together as a family, as there are many moments of educational opportunities. And though there is a little romance, and a pull for the main character towards two different love interests, the author kept that part quite PG. In truth, I couldn't see it get any deeper with her mixed feelings anyway. There is too much for her to learn of herself before moving into a deeper relationship.<br /><br />Great series. Can't wait for the next to be available for me at the library.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is much more than the recent movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; which was loosely based on one chapter in the book.  It's the only biography of Lincoln I've read that views him through his contemporaries and peers.  Lincoln was definitely the right man at the right time.  He was the greatest of all our Presidents to date bar none.

B009K6DKTS|5.0|I have only one comment after readi.g all of Taleb's work starting from Dynamic Hedging to Antifragile that he has at least lived a part of what he says andbelieves which is quite rare in modern world and this should be the primary reason for reading his books and works. Even his adversaries will accept this fact.

B0060QM09M|5.0|This book is a treasure. Herriot is the consummate writer. Beyond the charm in the stories of veterinary practice and, especially, calvings and lambings, Herriot's command of language makes for a joy of a read.

I have read two of Herriot's books so far and will certainly make my way through all of them. Two thumbs up!!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day was an exciting read, and I am one that does not read much, in fact you could count on one hand the number of books I have read in the last five years and have at least four fingers left.  I think that it turly did justice about the hardships and good times that the guys have while in the service.  I thank them for their service and pray for their families also.  I think that the title says it all -- NO EASY DAY.  We have to take it at the authors words that it is a &#34;Firsthand Account of the Mission That Kelled Osama Bin Laden&#34; but even if it was a fictionial account it had alot of good information about the way these type of missions may be handled.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|Even though it's fiction, this movie is very educating. It has giving me a lot of insight. The old king of the Vikings was a wise man in my view.
B007SXB498|5.0|What is left to be said about such a huge masterpiece? The magic is still there in the Kindle edition,
1469984202|5.0|As I read the first book, I thought it was going to go in a different direction than it ultimately did. With every book, I became more and more curious as to where it was going. Not your average predictable book. As a bonus, by book 5, it really got me thinking about the world we live in today (not that it was forced upon you by the author). The story line is great. It might have lagged a little in book 3 or 4 but I still enjoyed it as it's own story. I picked this up for 1.99 on a Kindle Daily Deal but it is certainly not a 1.99 read. Thank you Hugh Howey!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You don't even have to be a fan of Sci-Fi to like this series. I had only heard of Wool through the great reviews already posted up here on Amazon. Going into this book \\"blind\\" was truly a great experience, so I'm not going to tell you about the fantastic story (My jaw literally dropped open as I read faster and faster, my pulse raced with my eyes as I read the ending of Wool 1 as fast as I possibly could).<br /><br />Bottom line is for 5.99 it's a steal. I've paid far more for much lesser works. Buy this now. I haven't been this impressed with a series since Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I like it and would buy it again. To me Christina has one of the great voices of our time. I love her songs with both CeeLo and Blake Shelton I can listen to those over and over.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|So very much like all the other Bourne movies in action and pace but with no closure at the end. Like cutting someone's sentence off midword. The worst of the Bourne movies for that fact alone. All they did was escape.<br />I'm very glad I waited for this to be available as a rental. Was not happy at the extra $1 though. No rental on Amazon should be more than $4, but still glad I didn't buy it for $15. This is not a movie I want to watch again.<br />Amazon seems to be pressing us more and more to buy movies when they're released. This one was out for more than a week only to buy before a rental was offered at an inflated price.<br />I'd like to see a little more loyalty from Amazon to its customers to keep the products reasonably priced and available in the format we want.

B005JWU5JK|5.0|The mystery books and short stories written by Agatha Christie are timeless and her characters are as interesting as the plot.  Many of her delightful characters are found throughout different books, so the continuity makes it seem like you are reading about people that you know.  It's hard to imagine that murder mysteries are fun to read, but Agatha Christie's mysteries are fun to read!
0470449748|5.0|It is useful and the context is in detail. It is really cheap but good. If you think 13th edition is too expensive, this is also wonderful.

B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky is the underdog story we all know and love.  The reason this Collector's Edition is so special is that with the second disc we get to see how a no name actor'/screenwriter was able to take this story from an idea to the page to the screen.  I found this backstory to be nearly as poignant and interesting as the actual film, filled with grit and determination.  I think you will be surprised to see this side of Sylvester Stallone.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I realy like this as I love puzzles. These are quick to do and are handy. My only problem is I cant buy new puzzles from my Kindel. It keeps telling me I ne a credit card on file with Amazon. I have one why cant I buy puzzles?

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Perhaps the best thing about this series is how you can never know just what's coming next. After the shocking end to the first season (about which I won't go into detail, for those who have yet to see it), it's hard to imagine how the series could top it. But the plot twists and turns, as we learn this season, are only just beginning.<br /><br />The season premiere opens on a scene of brutal strength and violence (though followers of the books know that it's mere child's play in George R.R. Martin's Westeros). The cruel, sadistic nature of Prince Joffrey is particularly expounded upon throughout the season. Ofttimes, the villainous character in a show will garner support and sympathy from a select number of viewers, but thanks to the writing and superb acting by Jack Gleeson, the entire audience is just dying to get their chance to slap the evil prince.<br /><br />On that note, it has to be said that this show would not be what it is without its incredible cast. A particularly special find is the sheer amount of talent in its child actors. Sophie Turner, for example, plays Sansa with grace and sensitivity, effortlessly bringing the character from the naive, sometimes bratty, girl she was in season one to a matured, tragic woman in season 2. In addition, Maisie Williams hits the nail on the head with her portrayal of Arya. While in the previous season, Arya could simply be written off as the token tomboy character, she gains new, sometimes disturbing, depth when she and her two new companions, Gendry (Joe Dempsie) and Hot Pie (Ben Hawkey), are captured. From endearing banter to murderous glares, Williams has it all.<br /><br />While die-hard book fans may be disappointed with some of the changes from page to screen, the series still manages to impress. Admittedly, the dialog is a bit touch-and-go at times. At some points it seems to lag, while at others it's as melodramatic as a soap opera (e.g., \\"Where are my dragons?!\\"). However, overall, these things are only a minor annoyance- and mainly just to fans of the book series.<br /><br />Whether you've read the books or not, however, the show is a sheer pleasure to watch. The budget seems almost limitless as the locations are more remote and more stunning, the costumes are more real and immersive, and the special effects are, quite simply, art. It's impossible to simply watch this series; with every episode, you become more and more invested in the characters and their stories.<br /><br />For those who have yet to see this season and are waiting until the discs come out, be prepared to set aside a good 10-hour block of your time. Because once you start, you won't be able to tear yourself away.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I believe this is the best example of 3D quality content I could find in the market at the moment. I have a small collection of about 10 Bluray 3D videos (at the time of writing this review). With all other 3D movies I can see artifacts caused by left and right being out of sync in my LG Plasma TV + LG Bluray player. I have tried a variety of different settings to see if they will go away but they never do.<br /><br />But with Avatar the experience is different, it is completely seamless. The depth perception is awesome and dynamic scenes are truly enjoyable without any stutters or artifacts and no need to mention James Cameron's colorful wonderland in day and night.

B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It has great play time, good story and was entertaining. It is not too hard, but makes u use ur brain if on advanced level. It is not free for full version but they rarely are. This was a bit more than I would usually spend on full version, but I did enjoy it. I rated 4 stars due to price.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Game doesn't really work well. Freezes up & causes you to shut down or force close. Game has potential but a lot of bugs need to be fixed.

B001KQZ7I8|4.0|This is one of the most important books I've read this year. It definitely gives a philosophical and psychological perspective onto how humans can cope and survive almost anything by establishing or finding a meaning to their lives. The first part, which deals with life in the conecntration camps, is for lay people. The second part is more targetted towards psychologists or psychiatrists and can get a bit dense.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Been a fan since DAEMON. Doesn't shy away on the tech nor does he take shortcuts. This is well-researched (love the ravens) and makes you think about where we're headed as a society. This needs to be a movie NOW!

B008YUHQ3M|4.0|Everyone probably wants to disregard the trashing of the ultraviolet service and try it for themselves.  First of all, the digital copies you recieve are far superior in picture quality than any itunes or pc digital copy.  Secondly, you CAN now download copies of the movie to practically any device you own in hd and watch it whenever you want.  The complaints seem to be coming mostly from apple users who don't like the fact that apple doesn't support ultraviolet (they can still access it on any apple device through flixster).  Additionally, your ultraviolet account can have up to five people in it, who can share their entire uv library with each other.  Every uv movie you have on vudu is automatically available on flixster, cinema now, and vice versa on all of your computers, phones, smart tv's, xboxes, and playstations.  I have used it for a while and never had any problems with any of these features.  Yes, you may experience buffering when trying to stream hdx movies, but that is more a product of you network setup handling the large file sizes.  I have a wired network and have never had a single instance of buffering since I joined months ago.  You also have the option of switching each movie on the fly to regular or hd or sd to avoid this problem if you have a slow network.  I understand the negative reviews, as it has gotten off to a rough start, but give this format a chance for yourself, and realize that many of these comments are from people who simply want ultraviolet to go away so they can get their itunes codes back on blurays.  The best answer would be for apple to get on board and allow ultraviolet linking so everyone can watch the way they want.  Not likely to happen, but that's as much apple's fault as anyone's.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This needs to be made into a multi-hour miniseries. The tech is terrifying and detailed. Someone needs to grab this and run (if you're in a bookstore, please have the decency to pay for it 1st).

B000VK99Z6|5.0|This is British version of the classic “buddy cop” film.  Most of the humor is very subtle.  It does get a little bloody when it really did not need to.  The film, however, is worth watching more than once.  That alone earns it five stars.
B000HT386M|3.0|I rented this because I was in the mood for a comedy - you know, to laugh. It was incredibly sad, my daughter and I both bawled. Saddest movie since My Dog Skip. Cute movie but be warned, I would not consider it a comedy!

B008OJ291W|5.0|As if these ELO hits weren't great in the 1st place, they've now been perfected<br />with Jeff Lynne doing everything except strings, using 21st century technology.<br />The vocal performance on Telephone Line is worth the price alone.
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|This is a classic. It does not need to be rated. I didn't give it five stars because the voice-over by Ford was missing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It has all the best elements a movie can have... action, heroes, heroine, comedy, drama and just plain awesomeness. I may sound like a true nerd, but I never followed the Avengers or read the comic books. It definitely does not stop me from adoring this movie. Scar Jo is great and so is the rest of the cast. Chris Hemsworth... YUM!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is a great movie with a message.  Stop messing with the environment and other civilizations for the benefit of a few.  Great action, superb special effects and the story line was pretty good.  The technology behind this film was fantastic.
B005LAII08|5.0|I took my niece to see this in the theater and she loved it, which was expected for a little girl that loves all Disney movies. What I didn't expect was to love this movie as much as her. So when I saw this movie as being released in time for Christmas , I jumped at it.  Now all I got to do is try not to open it before I give it to her.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|catchy story with some good thoughtful sentences. easy to read and lighthearted enough to leave you smiling at the end. recommended by a friemd when I was out of books on my list. This was a pleasant way to spend my day

B004NS710C|4.0|For good ole Hollywood action, it's got lots of that, along with a great star, Denzel Washington.  Lots of good train action which I like 'cause I am an avid railfan, but that's where the believability stops.  While based on a true story, that train never got up to these speeds and wass eventually stopped without injury.  Hollywood realy outdid themselves by making Unstippable, &#34;unbelievable&#34;.  No train can take a curve like that, go up on one side and not go over into the storage tanks.  The engine Denzel is chasing with has only 3000 hp, yet he tells his dispatcher it has 5000, still not enough to catch two engines rated at 4,400hp each!!!  Denzel running along the tops of the grain hoppers and tank cars at nearly 60mph is also crazy.  The action was good, but the special effects were just not realistic.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|Received this copy and was concerned as the version I got no longer has the slipcase which states it provides the Itunes Digital Copy + Ultraviolet. I called Amazon back regarding this and was informed that it did include the digital versions. Removed the shrink wrap and discovered the codes inside. So while it shows digital copy on the page and the blu-ray case no longer does, you are still provided with one. Don't stress like I did when you receive it.
B00170KA0C|1.0|Not a Julia Roberts fan but I got it for my wife to view while recuperating from foot surgery. Even she turned it off.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|Great group of new and some past great mixes. Good value for the amount music you receive. Great addition to anyone's library.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I actually liked this one better than the first, but really don't know why I bothered with either one.  I guess the real disappointment was not seeing more of Jet Li, who jumps from the plane with a Chineese official.  The highlight was seeing Chuck Norris in cameos, which was good.  Otherwise, Arnold and Sylvestor gave their usual performances as well as showing their age.  It's still non-stop action with a good body count with a somewhat better story line than the first.  Seeing van Damm as a villian was interesting, but something he's done before.  Overall, good entertainment and lots of action.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is amazing! Simple as that! If you like the show then you should like the game. Got to to now. Borhoof! /)
B009VB7P6G|4.0|It was a good story in many  ways. the  importance of  relying on  others to  everyone's welfare and to  create  a family  with  those who  you  love and are by  your side regardless of whether the same blood runs through  your  veins or  not. after all friends are no  more than the family we pick  out for ourselves. with all of  the thinker bell movies id have to  say  this has so far  been my  favorite!
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Rawles recommended the movie and glad I got it.<br />What a hoot. Nazis on the dark side of the moon...
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Good science fiction with a rather predictable plot . . .alien falls for earth girl; earth girl helps battle bad aliens with help of High School geek, and save the other five survivors.  Oh, I almost forgot #5 alien girl who jumps in at the last minute to save #4 and the day.  Still, a good, entertaining movie.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|This is a cute movie, and I bought the regular blu-ray version. We got a 3D TV shortly after. I wish I'd bought the 3D version because it is one of those movies you can really tell would be fantastic in 3D.
B0085776BG|5.0|I ordered this movie when it first came out on Blu-Ray. The movie is inspirational and has plenty of action.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book, however I would not recommend it for the high school age.  It does have a lot of adult content, but does have a really good story as well.
B008LZYR0A|4.0|The Boys are back!  This is a fun &#34;single&#34; album featuring the song, &#34;Winner.&#34;  &#34;Winner&#34; is uplifting and positive.  It really fits in with the time period in which it was released (London Olympics).  It captures that feeling of the rush of Olympic competition, comeraderie and fame.  The rest of the songs are hooky and danceable.  &#34;I Started a Joke&#34; reminds me of their twinkle-in-my-eye &#34;Your Funny Uncle.&#34;  The highlight is the stirring &#34;The Way Through the Woods.&#34;  The lyrics are actually from a Rudyard Kipling poem but fit well with the PSB.  This is a hit!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great price for this set! My husband had the DVD set and he is a huge graphics person so when this came out on blu-ray, it was a must. Very happy with this product. It looks great in HD.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Ted has a great story in there somewhere, but this one is not it. Stupid action sequences and romance and sappy crap make this movie totally stupid. There could've been an amazing comedy in there but they really messed it up with too much wrapped into the script.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game!  With it being a free game it does have some ads, however it is still a lot of fun to play on the Kindle Fire.

B0063GORYU|4.0|This is one of my go to games to kill time.  Spider is straightforward to play and exactly what I would expect in a solitaire game.  My only gripe is that the latest update has gotten way more aggressive with full screen ads.
076115678X|5.0|My hairdresser bought this book in order to style my hair better and learn a bit more about how to deal with thick, curly hair. She let me borrow it, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It covers everything, and has recipes for &#34;hair potions&#34; inside. I haven't made any yet, so I can't testify to their effectiveness. Even if you don't buy the products suggested, it is still a great book, with a lot of useful tips. My favorite parts are the sections called &#34;Curl Confession.&#34; They are about women who never accepted their hair due to being made fun of in school or by family members. After trying the Curly Girl method, they learned to accept themselves for who they are. And their curly hair too! Highly recommend.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game was simple to play.  Easy to move around in, and was entertaining for both adults and young adults.
B007MU85D0|5.0|In a general sense, this album sounds like a blend of Bjork and Radiohead, but it's so much more than that. Definitely a contender for album of the year for 2012
B00000DHR0|5.0|Wow, Celine Dion sure can sing.  This album is wonderful with her soaring voice, packed with hope and emotions.  Christmas songs never sounded so good.  The topper was &#34;Ave Maria&#34;.  I could listen to it over and over. If you like Celine, and you like Christmas, this is a must have.
B00633W614|5.0|Typical Jeffrey Archer story telling, which I enjoy look forward to the continuation of the cronical.<br />Time slips away while turning the pages
B0051HNMTI|5.0|This is a great way to get started on getting into shape.  If you don't have a lot of time you can customize the workout or follow the 5 minute or 10 minute workouts.  You will feel the effects of the workout right away.  It shows you what to do and how long to do it.
0312548079|2.0|I read the reviews and thought hey maybe I would like Darcy in the sequel but I didn't. Her character is over the top, unrealistic and completely not likable at all. She moved across the world to do what? Mooch off someone else for her entire pregnancy and only for a hot second admit what a conceited so and so she really is. Where is the epiphany? The revelation of conscience ... Brrr I wanted more Rachel and Dexter and what was happening in their life.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I like movies that teach our kids not just entertain them. This is a movie the whole family will enjoy.
034580404X|5.0|I love every minute of the books I must have read each book about 6-times and am still reading them I just think the story line is great the sex is amazing not only that the way they fell in love gives me something to look forward too.
B006N9KFPC|2.0|Not the variety and quality of his first albumn.  Needs better material for this exception voice and major talent.  Hope for another, better effort soon,
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another good one in the Mitch Rapp series. I enjoyed this one just as much as the rest of the series and it may be one of my favorites thus far. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Mr. Rapp and Ms. Kennedy.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Addicting, strategy...good way to kill free time . Arcade mode is nice , however it always shows 999 as a score, maybe I'm no guru...but it's hard to beat a score that never changes.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a great game its long and worth the money great graffics and  has helpful hints when you need then so you dont get stuck. like im with a few other games and no hints so i dont play them anymore
B007L96SI6|5.0|Many favorite songs here.  She should have received way more crucial notice!  Good job.  Great voice and an exceptional talent.
B00A6N8YTU|5.0|It is one of the best gripping and mind blowing movie. Savages is a 2012 American crime thriller film directed by Oliver Stone. It is based on the novel of the same name by Don Winslow. The screenplay was written by Shane Salerno, Winslow and Stone. The film was released on July 6, 2012, and features an ensemble cast including Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.[3]
B008MM9630|4.0|I personally love this game. I am only rating 4 stars because everything is so expensive in the game. lower some of the costs and I will rate 5
1452110581|5.0|This was a great gift! It is humorous and if you have cats you will definitely relate to the poems inside. The photos are really cute too. Any cat person will love this!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I have been waiting to own this movie for quite some time now! I am very pleased with this purchase.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book was great, but about halfway through this one, I was like &#34;ok, I got that, you have sex&#34;.  It's really predictable.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and purchased it after the rental.  The depiction of the struggles, violence and corruption of the era kept my attention throughout!
B00136RUKI|5.0|This music is very personal for me. I remember when it was released and as all teens music is integrally a big part of your day. I love this and always will. The music and my memories are forever entwined.
0767903862|5.0|I needed this book for required reading for my trip to Australia--it was so much cheaper than any other venue.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The ending was somewhat predictable. It doesn't take long to figure out but  it kept me turning pages. I will definitely move to the third.
B006O6EOII|5.0|My daughter really loved this doll! It has alot of detail and was a nice edition to her monster high collection
B003UESJH4|5.0|Everyone has heard about the Prince who abdicated the throne for an American divorcee. But I had never even thought of the responsibility and hardship that it put on his brother. It made me realize my decisions affect those around me. They may have been overwhelmed when I have made a decision that was best for me without considering anyone else. The acting was spectacular and the choice for the roles was spot on.
B008AS5UAO|5.0|I KNOW THIS OPERA VERY WELL.............AND THIS RECORDING IS GREAT.  THE SINGERS ARE FIRST RATE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND  BUY IT !!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|The Coliseum  sucks as a venue . No matter the theory for player selection. The book was extremely interesting, especially for a Cub' s,Red Sox and A's. fan. Bring back Catfish.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|Flash drive's can be pricey. This is better quality then you can buy in the store for a much lower price. It also ships fast!
B0026P3G12|3.0|It's great but not a sound I listen to on a regular basis but it is beautiful. The story about the singer is itself is an inspiration .
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cry and jump.  You forget it's animated.  And the animation is spectacular.  I think it's a great movie for kids, too.
0439023521|5.0|This book is awesome.<br />And this paperback print by Scholastic is the best.<br />I was looking for the Catching Fire with paperback by Scholastic but I could not<br />find it on Amazon.
B00319ECGK|2.0|There is no doubt I enjoyed the amazing clarity of the video. It's noticeably better than the streaming version on Amazon thanks to the advancement in big screen TV (I suspect any 55&#34;+ would do). Unfortunately, I only had half of the fun because the sound level of the disc I received has only about half of what normal videos should be. I had to crank the amplifier, but the quality is not a theater like. I contacted Amazon customer service and was promptly offered to return it. She explained Amazon gets those discs from vendors like any of the stores. I'd like to think this is a one-off experience. With Amazon's policy, I'm not worried and certainly will buy more Blu ray discs. But be aware.<br /><br />Actually this is the first time I watch a Blu ray not counting the occasional glance at Best Buy floor. It's an &#34;old&#34; movie. I bought it because this movie is a milestone for Hollywood production. As such, I have very high expectation on the time spent on viewing it again. Giving it a two star is just a way to say I'm disappoint with the transfer.
B008NMT684|5.0|My kid loves this app but I'm stationed in Germany and cannot download the full version. Wish amazon would distinguish between military and non-military overseas.
0062101897|5.0|My daughter spent the afternoon absorbing as much info as possible from these pages. Still one of her favorite go-to books!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This is a classic that I had somehow never read. It is wonderfully written, emotional and a very rewarding read. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Not great. Not easy to pinpoint locations. Ok for a quick overview of a large area. Needs to have directional capabilities. Nice to be able to use the map overview offline, though.
0375423877|5.0|Great book!  The whole series is great and the lead character is just fantastic.  If you get a chance, read the whole series.
1932735410|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you are studying for the PMP Exam.  I believe this book is THEE reason that I passed my exam.  This book takes the very dry PMBOK and puts it in an enjoyable read.  They also provide great tips about approaching the exam as well as practice questions and exercises to ensure you understand the materials.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would recomend to anyone who loves zombies and the &#34;what if&#34;  this happened !!  What would you do ?
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Love the game, but need to give more free hints out. Don't want to pay for more hints. The game overall gets your mind thinking which is great.
B004LROMX4|3.0|E.T. meets Close Encounters of the third kind meets little kids running around with high power weapons.  Why is it the &#34;Hero's&#34; little boy runs around sparkling clean while the other little ones look like gutter rats.......get real......it's either a tour around the country side or fighting for their lives.  Great aliens!  Steven is this a childrens show or for adults?  Needless to say I'm a big fan of Walking Dead!
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I especially enjoyed the mystery at the heart of the novel. I would recommend to all mystery lovers.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|The DVDs arived in plenty of time for Christmas.  Savings were nice to have with the poor economic conditions of the country.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Something is better than nothing. I got this app for my kindle fire HD so I can see how much charge I have left.  I wish the charge number was displayed on the battery. Instead I have to access the app to see how much charge is there.
0316228532|3.0|It took a long time (about half way through) for me to really get into this story and to figure out how some of the characters were intertwined.  The beginning felt somehow disjointed.  But once I got past that the end was the type of compelling read I had been looking for.  Glad I stuck with it instead of giving up.
B00929G8SS|5.0|FOR FANS WHO HAVE BEEN PATIENTLY AWAITING A NEW MANOWAR CD, THE WAIT IS OVER AND THEY DO NOT DISSAPOINT!! JOEY AND THE BOYS TRULY DELIVER THE GOODS WITH THEIR BEST ALBUM IN AT LEAST 15 YRS.

B00006GO99|5.0|Product was in perfect condition! I am giving this as a gift, and have no issue with the quality. Would definitely buy from this seller again!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|very funny.. i had to see the movie again.. i would recommend this movie to anyone thinking of a movie to watch and laugh...
B007THA4FI|2.0|Was looking forward to reading J.K. Rowling, but found the book disturbingly poorly written and conceived.  I was disappointed, I really wanted to like it. I did read to the end, where it pulled all the plots and sub-plots together, however, it was too little too late.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|As someone who grew up loving horror movies and went on to be a U.S. History teacher, I am conflicted over \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\\"  Prior to watching \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,\\" I made two errors.  My first error was in reading the book (which I thoroughly enjoyed) earlier in the year.  My second error was watching \\"Lincoln\\" which was released in November 2012.  I also failed to follow the sage advice of a former student who once told me to park my brain at the door and enjoy the action when viewing such movies.<br />\\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" would have been much more enjoyable and believable (assuming one accepts the existence of vampires) if it had hewed more closely to the book.  The movie would also have benefitted from an explanation as to how vampires came to America and how they adapted to sunlight.  The use of silver to kill vampires strained my credulity.  I grew up believing that a stake through the heart was the only way to kill vampires and that silver was for werewolves.<br />While recognizing that \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is fiction, the courageous depiction of Mary Lincoln was completely unrealistic.<br />Finally, while understanding that sex sells, the brief sexuality was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the movie.  I am now glad that I did not take my granddaughters to see it this summer.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The final movie of the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy.I went to see this movie on opening night at a midnight showing.i loved it! In my opinion,the dark knight rises was the best superhero film of 2012. its far better than the avengers or the amazing spiderman.In the dark knight rises i actually cared about the characters.I even felt sympathy for the villian [Bane].I am so glad to add this to my dvd collection.
0307730697|4.0|The biography was a well written book and realistic.It  put Adam Brown and his whole life family and friends in perspective.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I think this game needs a demo because unlike people like me I don't have extra money on me or they could lower the price just a little.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great film. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to everyone.  The actors are great and the setting is beautiful.  It is a little gem and a great comedic British drama.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its really fun. puts a new perspective on where's my water. makes you think differently good for passing time.. if you like mind games get this app
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a really good book. I found myself so interested in this love story that I just wanted more. i am not much of a reader but this book I couldn't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT!! I loved the the suspense in a love story. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie  but a book is always better!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was well written and one of the best I have<br /> read about what is beyond our world. I love it.
1416987118|5.0|This book has been a hit for my older grandchildren and I'm now buying it for the younger set.  It is one of those books that they want to hear over and over for nights in a row.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Pretty good movie! It was missing something but I cant tell you what. Maybe it was how passive Meryl was? Worth a watch if you are or ever have been married.
B00999DFP0|5.0|What's not to love?  The disks were not &#34;boxed&#34; but none the less it was seasons 1-5.  Was a great Christmas gift for my wife.  I received my order in just a few days and the price was lower then Ebay!
B005LAII08|5.0|Brave is a very good movie! The animation is great & the story good. The children loved it !!  Another Disney classic in the making. Would definately recomend you buy &#34;Brave&#34;
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love very song on this album, it is wonderful from start to finish. I can't say that very often anymore. This is the rise of a relevant musician.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I found this to be an amazing read - even more so when you remind yourself that it is true.  This story is a stark reminder of how much we take for granted as Americans and how fortunate we are to have heroes who willing sacrifice everything so that we can continue to live our lives without any discomfort or interruption.  I strongly believe that all Americans should read this and thank a service member.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Even as an adult, I still love fairy tales with Cinderella being one of my favorites.  I love how Ms. Meyer has take the tale and meshed it with dystopian elements creating a thrilling adventure and a dash of romance.  It stays close enough to the original tale to recognize it, but offers up many new plot, backdrop and character elements to take it well beyond and into something new.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg and she is a mechanic in New Beijing.  It is the future and the world has peace, but it isn't a bright future for any human or human cyborg.  The world is riddled with a plague virus and there is threats of war between earth and Lunar- the country on the moon.  On a personal level, Cinder's own existence is rather bleak much of the time.  Cyborgs are treated as second rate citizens.  She lives with her reluctant guardian and the lady's two girls.  Her guardian only took Cinder into her home because the lady's husband adopted Cinder shortly before his death.  Cinder like the original Cinderella is worked hard and never appreciated.<br /><br />Suddenly, Cinder's life gets a bit more interesting when Prince Kai comes to her booth in search of a good mechanic to fix his android.  Prince Kai is not what Cinder expects.  He is friendly and kind and she doesn't want to see him look on her with disgust so she keeps her cyborg self hidden from him.<br /><br />Events progress for both of them with Cinder learning there is much more to her than she realized even as things change in her home.  For Kai, he is faced with the death of his father leaving him the new emperor when he is crowned and bringing an impatient Queen of Lunar to his palace with barely concealed threats if he doesn't comply with her demands.  The Queen plots against him even as he struggles to find a way to help his people and avoid war with the Lunar.  The friendship between Cinder and Kai is something sweet to both of them, but their secrets and differences are destined to pull them apart.<br /><br />While the plot of this book follows the Cinderella story, that by no means allowed me to feel like I knew exactly what was going to happen next or what each character was going to do or say.  For one thing, one of the step-sisters is actually a sweetie and for another the plots and intrigue of the Lunar weave through things enough that I was kept guessing.  I love stories that have plots and characters that are loaded with secrets that reveal yet another layer of secrets as they twist their way to the end.  This one was no exception.  I guessed the truth a few times based on some foreshadowing, but there were still a few shockers for me.  Then there's the fact that it ended on a cliffhanger that really deviates from the original Cinderella story.<br /><br />The world building was fascinating.  I loved the backdrop of post-WWIV Beijing that's a combo of technology and struggle after natural and economic disasters have riddled the globe.  I love the concept a human-like race living on the moon.  The social issues of cyborgs, plague research and humans was all neatly done by showing the issues and the need for reform without heavy-handing the details.  The Lunar people are another creative piece with their personal differences and different society.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn.  Cinder and Kai are easily likeable.  The story only gives them a few scenes and they are wistful and friendly with a possibility for more with the bulk of the story sticking with the issues caused by the plague and the Lunar Queen.  On Kai's part, he would like to see more, but Cinder is a realist and knows a chance with Kai is just a dream.  Although, we do leave Kai with Cinder's poor old cyborg foot.<br />The secondary characters are not flat cut out figures just used to manipulate a scene.  There are several characters that are of interest between a couple of Lunar along with the step-mother and step-sister roles that I just loved to hate, the ambiguous types like the doctorand the Emperor's adviser that I can't work out how I feel about them, and then the ones I loved like the younger step sister Peony and Cinder's android friend, Iko.<br /><br />The story is part of a series and I eagerly await the next installment in the Lunar Chronicles.<br /><br />The story is devoid of bad language, sex, and little more than mild violence, but there are moderately intense scenes caused by the plague.  I can recommend this for young and youngish readers who enjoy a futuristic fairy-tale retelling full of intrigue and just a hint of romance.and the Emperor's adviser that I can't work out how I feel about them, and then the ones I loved like the younger step sister Peony and Cinder's android friend, Iko.<br /><br />The story is part of a series and I eagerly await the next installment in the Lunar Chronicles.<br /><br />The story is devoid of bad language, sex, and little more than mild violence, but there are moderately intense scenes caused by the plague.

B00645LFA4|1.0|Such [...] I can't stand it.  Shrek has NOT been remastered in 3d, this stupid blu ray is just a copy of the footage for the 15 minute universal studios ride, and 15 minutes is what you get.  Its a travesty that either amazon, or much more likely dreamworks, is resorting to this kind of thuggish trickery to sucker a few extra dollars of revenue from faithful patrons of the franchise.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was my first Blu-ray purchase and I'm really glad it was because on top of the speedy delivery, it is the Avengers and I love all of the extra features that this 4 Disc has! Everything was in perfect condition and was nice and crisp in quality and plays so well in my laptop and in my PS3 that I have nothing bad to say about it. I love buying through Amazon--so far very little bad has happened to me by taking advantage of the deals.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Not sure what it is about this TV show, I certainly did not expect to be hooked on a show about zombies!, but I love this show!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Bosch series, but was disappointed in this book.  No real character development, and the Harry I know is not an action hero.  Leave the shoot-em-up plots to writers who cannot do any better.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of the movie. Well written and the acting was excellent. I highly recommend the movie to everyone.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I need to start out stating this one thing: I somehow managed to avoid seeing Jaws up until I picked it up on Blu Ray last month.  That being said, I can't compare it to an older DVD release or how I may have seen it in a theatre.  So with fresh eyes, the best review I can give it is that the transfer from the original film is amazing.  The sound is great, the picture is PERFECT, and it gave me the sensation that I can only imagine it was like to see it on the big screen when it first came out.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I chose this movie because i seen it before and wanted to see it again.  Not having to worry about mailing it back in or taking it back to the movie box machine.  I just upload it on my account and watch it on my game box in the comfort of my home.  I am not a collector of movies so downloading it works for me.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Better than Book One, but still not very well written. Extremely repetitive. My purpose in continuing to read this series is to try to figure out just exactly why Grey needs to control - in E.L. James' mind. -  This trilogy is not at all arousing, nor is it erotic. If you are looking for something along those lines... read the Beauty Trilogy - Anne Rice.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I started the Hunger Game Series by seeing the movie instead of reading the first book. I read both Catching Fire and Mockingjay immediately following the movie. Mockingjay is a satisfactory and realistic end to the trilogy. I definitely recommend the entire series to adults.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is challenging and realy addictive and fun. You shouldbget it and its free. Dont worry if you get addicted because it uses your head.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I bought this cd for an co-worker and she loves it.<br />She loves Whitney Houston so this made it even better
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We absolutely LOVED this movie! Very entertaining for children and adults. This has definitely found a spot in our Christmas movie library!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The author's style has you looking over the main characters shoulder while events occur. And this read make realize how important a broad spectrum of learning can be. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the style of writing. Watney came alive for me!
030759565X|5.0|I like this cookbook a lot.  I really enjoyed the spicy Dutch Baby and the Goey Cinnamon Squares were wonderful.  Although I am not from the area of the country where they are made (the midwest maybe?) I've wanted to make the goey butter cakes but all the recipes I've seen have used cake mix which I would never use.  It is nice to have a recipe from scratch.  I also want to try the pizza with asparagus curls.  The brisket recipe looks great too, although I haven't tried it yet.  I need to defrost a brisket that is in the freezer.<br /><br />My primary reason for this review though is because when I ordered the book there seemed to be a fight going on about the child content of the book and people saying it was excessive.<br /><br />First let me say I don't have kids and I'm not fond of child content where it is unecessary.  I stopped reading a well known knitting blog once when the author had a baby and went baby crazy.  People, there is not a lot of information about the author's son in her book.  I saw one small picture of her son eating something and there is some mention of her son of in the background of some of the recipes, in the header above the recipes.  It is no big deal.<br /><br />Don't let something like that keep you from getting a good and useful cookbook.<br /><br />BTW, I've never read her blog, just saw the cookbook here on Amazon and enough of the recipes to order it.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I liked this it was neat to FINALLY see how the ship crashed on the planet. The picture is beautiful on blu ray!
B007HACDLK|4.0|enough already, I liked it.  i am not going to answer these anymore.  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome! I loved it! I can't wait for the next book to come out! But... when does it come out?
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Feeling sad? Listen to this album.<br />Feeling angry? Listen to this album.<br />Feeling happy? Listen to this album.<br />Struggling to sleep? Listen to this album.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of classical music or pop, this album is really enjoyable and well worth the money.  The joy that the Piano Guys find in their work is apparent in every song.  You will not be disappointed in your purchase.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This has to be the best conversion from DVD to blu-ray I have EVER seen! I had the Alien Quadrilogy dvd box set and I sold it because this is absolutely an AWESOME box set. The picture quality from comparing the dvd to blu ray is like no other. You can see the detail of everything crystal clear! Like before on aliens even on the dvd it seemed a little grainey at times. Well it got cleaned up with this transfer. I could go on but this is the MUTHUR of all Blu-Ray sets and the SIXTY extra hours of special features and TWO bonus discs UN-FREAKING BELIEVABLE! I have NEVER seen this many extras on ANY box set before it!
142334216X|5.0|I just finished book four and get to start this one tomorrow. I cannot wait to hear how Mackala gets thru this story. I hope that Barrons is not the monster in book 4. Get this set, read it or listen to it to see what is going on.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This game is fun and really cute. There are no permissions which makes it even better! There are no timers, which helps to make it stress free! Thanks for a fun, permission free, nostalgic style game. Kudos to the developers!!
B0050R0XPA|4.0|My grandson and his father had a great time putting this together. Since my grandson received this for his  6th birthday, I think Daddy did most of the work. Anyway, they both loved it and it now sits proudly on my grandson's dresser for Christmas. It is a cute display. The whole group would be worth it if you can afford it. Lego's gets parents and children working together which today is a great thing! The only reason I gave it four stars is the price
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|A little labor intensive for me, but it works. I'd rather just have one that I could set and turn it on for the next morning if I need it, not one that you schedule for the week.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Started wataching the first movie after the second one was in the theaters.  I think the critics were a little hard on this movie.  Definently a father daughter movie.  Worth it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying this game. Still working my way up to the advanced versions, and it's a nice option to have. The tiles move easily and quickly and it automatically reshuffles.<br /><br />Pam
B000V9HW3S|5.0|Great voice, nice arrangements, very soothing way to listen to holiday classics in a new way. Favorite holiday album in my car right now. And, with it also being on the Amazon cloud, accessible at any time when my work day needs a little holiday cheer.
B00772M1F6|5.0|He sings like if he were in the 50's! Very good sound quality! If you love rock and roll, buy it!

B007MDB6L0|5.0|We let our girls get this as an early Christmas present and they loved the movie.  The story was great and so were the new characters.
6302800927|3.0|There were pauses in the movie but did get through it but didn't really care about playing it more than a couple times.
B006O3MU96|5.0|As addicting as the previous editions, I recommend this to any of the doodle jump fans out there or even those who have never played!

B0059XTU22|1.0|Peter Jackson and the rest of the film crew have horribly adapted The Hobbit into a film. A correct adaptation of The Hobbit would produce one film that is slightly over 3 hours, or produce two films where each part is 2 hours. There is no need for a trilogy where each film nears 2 and half hours. But the Jackson team decided to make a trilogy comprised of a story that is severely stretched far beyond what it should be.<br /> Positives about the film are: the visuals, the acting, and the score. Each screenshot looks amazing and is filled to its entirety. Actors assume the roles fairly well, and some create a character that seems to have walked straight off the book's page. The score is wonderful and sets tones perfectly; the soundtrack is actually worth the buy. But none of these positives make up for how long and how slow this first film is.<br /> Film makers did a horrible job at creating a film that edits out the slow parts of the book, and The Hobbit has plenty of parts where it needs to be edited in order to keep the story from slowing down. The second half of the book has tons of chapters and parts of chapters that have way too much dialogue, scenes of walking, and scenes of sleeping that are not important to the overall story. That second half of The Hobbit requires film makers to know what to cut out in order to create a film (or two films) where the viewers are on a non-stop thrill ride.<br /> A proper film adaptation would have an opening shot of Bilbo lighting his pipe as he sits outside. By the first half hour of the film, Bilbo should be at the trolls. Slightly over an hour, Bilbo should be in the cave with Gollum. An hour later, Bilbo and the dwarves should be plotting how to escape from the elves. Half an hour later, they should be preparing to fight Smaug. Twenty minutes later, the film should be over. This product of a Hobbit film can be produced when film makers cut out all the dialogue, walking, and sleeping that is not important to the overall story.<br /> Sadly, Jackson and his team do not produce such a product. They put in extra dialogue and extra scenes that are not in the book. This causes the film to be very slow and filled with tons of scenes where characters are not doing anything important to the overall story. But if Jackson and his team wanted to create three films to profit from, they had to severely stretch The Hobbit far beyond what it should be.<br /> The worst scene to be adapted from the book is when Bilbo and Gollum battle each other. The book depicts this scene as scary because Gollum is so slimy, crazy, and willing to eat anything. There is no humor in the dialogue and the scene is scary because readers do not know what Gollum is capable of nor do readers know what Gollum is willing to do so he can kill Bilbo. The Jackson team does not portray the scariness of this scene at all, and they add in humorous dialogue that under-minds the scariness of Gollum.<br /> The film also falls short with certain computer animation. The trolls, the wolves, and Gollum, do not look real because they either look to shiny, too dull, or they lack 3 dimensional aspects. These faults of the computer animation make it very easy to spot the animation, and that causes the film to lose its impact of lifelikeness. One can only imagine how poor Smaug the dragon will look in the next film.<br /> Due to such a poor film adaptation of The Hobbit, Hollywood definitely needs to consider remaking this film and it definitely needs to reconsider the validity Peter Jackson has as a director. But it is clear such considerations will not be performed because those considerations should have been made as soon as Return of the King was released. After that film, it was clear Jackson was poor at adapting Tolkien stories and it was clear that another film maker should have been assigned to film The Hobbit.<br /> A smart film maker would know how much editing The Hobbit needs in order to create a non-stop thrill ride. Such a film maker would realize you do not put in extra scenes and dialogue, you cut out irrelevant parts to create an action adventure film. And Jackson's film adaptation fails in this regard. Anyone who reads The Hobbit will realize how horrible this film is, especially since it only takes 3 and a half hours (perhaps 4) to read the book.

B006TVQU6C|5.0|I bought this case as a replacement/upgrade when my last system died because of overheating. It's a bit on the large side, but that definitely works to its advantage.<br /><br />First and foremost, this case is cavernous on the inside. Plenty of room for drives, different form factor motherboards, full-length expansion cards, you name it! Another bonus is that all of the fan mounts are for higher-flowing 120mm fans. I believe there are five, in total: one in the top, one in the bottom, two in the front, and one in the rear (though I could be wrong about that). Also useful, the internal drive bays are oriented toward the side of the case, rather than the rear (making cabling less of a headache and likely improving interior air flow). Externally, the all-black theme is simple, yet elegant. And who can complain about having front USB 3.0 ports? Not I. Overall, it has solid build quality, free of vibrations and rattling typical of lighter-weighted cases. I am thoroughly happy with this product.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I did like it enough to actually watch and not play games on my computer during the movie.<br />Very funny.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Husband loved it.  Just as described & shipped to us very very quickly.  Thanks so much for making this item available.
B008AT71WI|5.0|The original ending was originally cut out because of negative audience reactions simply because it was grim, but this version restores it as it was supposed to be. The ending adds a whole new level of emotion and depth to the film, especially Audrey's last song. Not to mention how plain awesome it is to watch the plants rampage in vivid color and sound. Compared to this version, the theatrical release seems kind of silly, as it was a last minute happy reshot for the masses. This version is for us fans.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's The Weather Channel. What more needs to be said? It is a very reliable source for my daily forecast.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|I had just recently heard the first three tracks of this recording on our local classical station, and Only classical station, here in Chicago. I caught it just before leaving for work. Well, I missed my bus and was late, thanks to this broadcast. And I really didn't care. The Four Seasons has been a favorite of mine since I was a child, but what crept through the airwaves, through my loudspeakers, and into my living room was a different ghost. I must say that that particular morning was Not a particularly good one, until I heard the first opening strokes from the strings. Then the intro dissolved into the first movement of Spring. Yes, I wept. (Put aside your rolling eyes. If music does not have the ability to move you in this way, don't bother listening to it. And I feel sorry for you). Richter had taken the most emotive, poignant parts, parts that needed repeating, ever so little, but to the greatest effect. Repeats and parts are introduced that do not exist in Vivaldi's original manuscipt, but they Could have. Nothing in it sounds foreign or obtuse for the sake of art. If this piece has been with you as long as it has been with me, you will see what I'm getting at here. In ways, Richter created a remix. A remix of memory, with artistic license, punctuating the most beautiful of parts. Like someone nudging you and saying, \\"Do that again\\". I'm not going to go on any further, except to say that this is a beautifully rendered and recorded album. I highly recommend it. If you don't like it, I'll buy your copy and pass it on to someone else. Another \\"reviewer\\" is exempt from this offer. Enjoy.

B002GYI9C4|3.0|It was a let down after reading the trilogy, and it wasn't really surprising at all. I think the end could have been much better.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: A phenomenal book, well-written and something you can devour in days. Fast-paced, had me racing to get the next one, though I have to admit, I was completely crushed to find out that Clary and Jace are siblings, but Clare still has me hoping and praying that it's somehow not true, that there's a loophole of some sort. Oddly enough, I'm almost rooting for incest because they have such an amazing chemistry on the page. I have a feeling I'll be crushed in the end, but either way, I want to find out!!!
1616960922|5.0|An interesting premise for a fantasy book.  People can change physical objects by forging them and changing their history and characteristics. The main character, Shai, has 90 days to try to forge the Emporer's soul, something that has never been done, or lose her life.  The author, Brandon Sanderson has again created a strong female character, a believable magic system and a great ending.  It is short enough to read in a day or two, makes you care about the character, keeps you on the edge of your seat and can't put it down.  My husband especially loved it.  I think it would be a great book for men or women, or young adults.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I mostly use this to watch music videos whenI have some free time, and I just wish there was more of a variety for what's on there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not like I thought it would be....I figured it out from the get go. I wish it had more turns.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|It's an interesting concept in this series, a very vivid world but I am finding by the second book that I am losing interest. I'm not interested in the main characters being together, but perhaps it is my conformity coming out. I am on the third one now, though I have put it down to read other books because I'm just no longer that interested.
B008CP93S0|2.0|This movie had so much potential and just fell flat at every turn. It was very weird and had some pretty stupid moments in it. I just didn't get it really, and I have a pretty open mind.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best one I have used. Seems to be very accurate and I like the radar animations.  I would recommend this app!
B006LSZECO|4.0|While some of my friends said they figured this out before the end, I was captivated and puzzled until three-quarters through.  Gillian Flynn's best novel so far.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is an amazing sequel. I was so sucked in I finished it in 3 or4 days.... which is pretty impressive for me. I can't wait to start the third book!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|moves too slowly in the beginning, then too many coins. prizes should be random, not obviously stacked against the player.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I had my doubts going into season two with the much too early passing of Andy Whitfield as he was the perfect choice for the role of Spartacus. Liam McIntyre stepped in and filled the larger than life shoes left by Andy and he did an excellent job of taking over as Spartacus. Andy can never be replaced but Liam brought his own style to the character and Season 2 was very enjoyable. I am looking forward to the final season, Season 3. Rest in piece, Andy.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|This was the best way to catch up on last season before this season started.  Sure I could have done online for free, but this was much easier!

031603973X|5.0|I absolutely adore this book!<br />My daughter will be so happy at Christmas because of it.<br />I simply love it.
B001K3K5MO|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time a couple years ago and I thought it was pretty good.  It's one of those movies that you just have to watch but it didn't completely knock my socks off.  I always have thought Tom Cruise is really corny!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes stories. Some versions I've seen have been hit/miss and some have been excellent. In my opinion, this version falls in the latter category. It illustrates the essence of the troubled genius and his long suffering, but stalwart, companion and friend. Can't wait to see how Moriarty will be pulled into the series. Definitely, one of my favorite series. Will be keeping up with this one.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love it !!!! it fit perfect and is very easy to carry. What I love most is all the accesorries that came with it.
030771652X|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that if you have a sister(s), this story may (or may not) affect you more than a person who doesn't have a sister(s).<br /><br />Older sister Bee has a fiancé (Todd), a great career and lives in the United States. One evening Bee gets a call from her mother in England who informs her that her younger sister, Tess, is missing. Even though Bee believes Tess has just gone off somewhere and forgotten to tell anyone; and being the over-protective big sister she is, Bee gets on a plane to make sure Tess is all right. However, shortly after Bee arrives, Tess's body is found. The police conclude that Tess took her own life. This satisfies her mother and Todd but not Bee. Bee cannot and will not accept that her sister committed suicide as Bee and Tess were the closest of sisters throughout their entire life. The fact that she also knows Tess better than anyone else, including their mother, convinces her that they are all wrong. No one will listen. Both her mother and Todd do their best to convince Bee that Tess killed herself. Regardless, Bee is determined to prove that her sister was murdered, even at the expense of losing everything and everyone, even her own life. With no one to support her - not Todd, her mother, or the police - Bee decides to investigate her sister's life on her own. She soon discovers secrets about Tess. Secrets that made Bee wonder that as close as they were, why Tess never came to her. It is the secrets that reveal various parties who all had motives to remove Tess from the picture.<br /><br />We learn more about Bee and Tess's relationship through the letters Bee is writing her deceased sister. The story of their relationship is beautifully relayed. It is written with so much thought and emotion that you can feel the love that Bee and Tess had for each other; what Tess meant to Bee; as well as the grief and loss Bee endures throughout. Not only is this a gripping story with twists and turns that keeps the reader engaged and intrigued to know the truth, it evokes the reader's emotions.<br /><br />Having two younger sisters myself, I was brought to tears several times while reading this emotionally charged novel.(less)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|So far I find it very interesting and can't wait to read it all.Seems like it will be a real page turner
0307716546|5.0|After reading Rosamund Lupton's novel \\"Sister,\\" which I absolutely loved, I eagerly awaited her new novel \\"Afterwards.\\" It did not disappoint.<br /><br />The brief synopsis of the novel is just that - brief. It's a well-executed, beautifully written, well-paced suspenseful novel told in a manner I had not expected; however, still enjoyed and appreciated. It's a heartbreaking, thought-provoking tale of love and sacrifice, and more importantly how wrong or misguided we can be about the people closest to us. I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to give the story away.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading \\"Afterwards.\\" It's not a depressing tale, but a sad one. I even shed a few tears. Read it and hopefully you'll love it as much as I do.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have this game on every device I own. It drives me crazy but I love it. I plan on getting all the levels right.

B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! Easy read, real page turner! Great story line! I recommend to anyone that like fifty shades of grey!!!
B007HACDLK|3.0|The ending was predictable, I enjoyed reading this book but was a little disappointed with ending. I will continue reading his novels, but this was not one of his best..
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a wonderful story from beginning to end. It had a refreshing military twist to it, and as usual, great characters. Bosch's daughter is getting more and more interesting and I look forward to her participating in future novels. The story involves Bosch's case from the open unsolved unit of the LAPD and even though the case is 20 years old Bosch hangs on to it like a pit bull. The victim is killed during during the riots in Los Angelos in 1992 but it isn't as simple as it originally seemed. Bosch was there on the scene in '92 but didn't have the resources or the time to do it justice. Now, 20 years later, he is determined to solve it against all odds. When his boss and his boss's boss try to stop him (it doesn't look good for the only white woman casualty to get more resources) Bosch goes off on his own time and own dime.<br />My one criticism is that I am getting tired of the stereotypic boss that is stupid, self-interested and tries to thwart our beloved Harry all the way. Does every crime novel have to have one? C'mon - be more original.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This movies look AWESOMEEE, if you are a fan of this trilogy and you did not had any of the previous movies before like me, this is the product for you, even better if you have a TV with 840 motion rate jeje totaly recomend this item.

B00004Y87O|5.0|Even though I purchased the DVD, whenever this movie comes on TV I have to watch it. I really like Kirk Russell as Snake. He's defiant and supported by a great group of actors like Harry Dean Stanton, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef, and Tom Atkins. Its not a block buster story but it sure keeps my interest. And I love the twist at the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are so many games to play. But there are so many adds.I bated the update it take away all your progress. Its ok.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is as good or better than the previous eleven. In this case, I have a sore neck from being whip lashed by the twists and turns.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The plot was ridiculous even for a comic book movie. Actually even for a comic book. Too many villians. Anne Hathaway is cute and can act, but was badly cast as Catwoman. Bane was ridiculously bad. The whole prison part of the story made no sense. The authorities response to the major portion of the plot made no sense. The interactions between Bruce Wayne and the rest of the characters made no sense. Only one of the surprises had any surprise in it at all and the reveal was pointless and badly written. So, better than Batman and Robin, but not good.
B0099114WO|5.0|really enjoyed this movie funny up lifting good story line .they need to make more movies like this . thank you
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I got one of the first copies of &#34;Standing Ovation&#34; and I haven't quit playing it since it was delivered.  She has a voice from heaven and I can just sit back, close my eyes and relax as I listen to her recordings. I have her other three albums as well and would recomend them as highly.

B005DR64OQ|3.0|If you're planning to rob a rich's man's fortress, get organized first. Take your meds at least 1 day before the deed, get sober on that day, don't take drugs or too much alcohol, don't tell too many people about it, and please leave the junkie girlfriend locked up at home (she's leaving her paw-prints everywhere)!<br /><br />This movie ought to be categorized as a COMEDY!<br /><br />I'm giving this a pass grade because of the seemingly intense emotions that the actors displayed in this movie. Nicole Kidman may have saved this movie with her good looks, but she deserves better than to star in a cheap movie like this one.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that those robbers didn't get what they wanted as they were  disorganized incompetents.

B002BWP49C|1.0|Vampires suck! Watch: [[ASIN:B003UESJBU Vampires Suck]], then watch \\"Twilight\\"!<br /><br />This \\"Twilight\\" movie looks more exciting than all the previous movies. However, I'm NOT a fan of this movie series because the characters look so cheesy. Movies often look this way when they try to bring an author's world into reel world.<br /><br />In this movie, the wolves still look like computer animations being pasted on a green movie screen and still look unrealistic. Lead actress Kristen Stewart exercises her facial muscles more often than usual, she smiles a little more than usual, makes more noise, and she seems to say more words! Bravo! Good job, Kris. Not that she was too quiet before, but somehow that Bella character demeans the actress herself... OK, whatever, I just find Edward repulsive!<br /><br />I intend to edit this review at a later time, if I can find the time! LOL!<br /><br />Recommended viewing:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003UESJBU Vampires Suck]]

B008A1NSTG|5.0|I didn't want to watch this movie at first. My mom had been bugging my dad and I to let her know when it came out in theaters so she could go see it. Well she missed it, I saw it on here one day and I made the mistake of telling her. She bugged me for a week to rent it so she could watch it.... but I had to watch it with her. lol We watched it and I was glad she told me I had to. Great cast and a great movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent movie.  The acting is fantastic.  I would recommend this movie to adults, especially adults over 50.  Younger adults will probably enjoy this movie too, especially if they have aging relatives.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|hmmmm, Rambo in fully throttle? I am still not to sure half the time what the plot is in these movies. Am I watching Rambo? Rocky? or one of the other many movies Sly has come up with? So much action and yet it never seems to go anywhere except.....Bad guy dead..... good guys come out on top and minor losses.....AGAIN. Make a movie where all the heroes die and the bad guy becomes the good guy in the end by taking his own life?? sounds weird.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We got this item for a gift for our grandchildren.  It's great fun and hard to put down.  Good for a wide range of ages.  They love the challenge!
B0044KJIIC|5.0|The ending is great when he finally dawns his new suit and becomes the man he was being pushed to be by both of his fathers. Both had their own ways or guiding him.
B005BHNCO8|5.0|This product has met my expectations. Although I have only used it a few times since my purchase it is a great item. It's sturdy even in grass, where I've had to use it most. The umbrellas are a nice size. I'm happy I purchased this kit for my start into strobist photography.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Batman coming back and kicking butt in his old age.... reminds me of..... well batman. lol Old, onry and not ready to back down to someone half his age and in better shape.....sounds like my 96 year old grandfather. lol
B0096CDG0O|3.0|So far, it is okay. The game itself is just a little dull. The turns seem too fast because each turn doesn't take long at all.
B0088TG252|5.0|This was a movie that I thought was going to be gritty.... I just wasn't aware of how gritty it was going to be. I enjoyed every suspenseful moment of this movie from beginning to end. WOW what a performance. Ryan was on point and complimented Denzel wonderfully.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|We bought this truck for our son's 9th birthday.  He loves the Bruder trucks!  They are built really well, & he still loves to play with them.  He even asked for a Bruder for Christmas.  They are very pricey, but well worth the money!
B000AP04NI|5.0|My wife got to watch this movie with me and my mom for the first time. She had never heard of it before! She was impressed with all the singing and dancing in the movie and even had me pause so she could learn some of the dancing in it. lol
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Looks like John is trying to be politically correct in his latest. His character is a black man unjustly sent to prison. I guess even autors have to try and be PC. Good story, easy read, good way to pass the time. No shocking end. Worth the read
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Batman! This was a good Batman Movie as well. Catwoman wasn't her normally cat self this time around. The outfit was good on her.
1451696191|5.0|I loved the movie just so much that I immediately ordered the book. The book is just as fantastic!!! I recommend it heartily!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I have never cried watching a movie no matter how sad it was. I almost cried watching this one. The performance that this cast gives every second of the movie is ripping. Emotionally grasping at you and making you feel for the family. I watched it 2 times, once alone and the second time with my mom. I had to get her a box of tissues.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you are watching this movie, you know what you are expecting. Tons of explosions, gunshots, tattoos, and knives, with a few gorgeous women sprinkled in. As for the plot, ummm..., there were too many explosions, gunshots, tattoos, knives, and gorgeous women to pay attention to the plot.....thinking about it, there may not have been one. Anyway, it rocked. Everything i was expecting.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|What can I say? This movie is so far out there, it takes your imagination for a ride and brings it back questioning its own sanity by the end. lol I can't wait for more M.I.B. movies if there are going to be more.
B00845PV16|1.0|I didnt even finish this movie, and I have low expectations. GhostRider 1 was pretty good. They butchered this one. They had a pretty good start with the first one. I have no idea why they didnt just make part 2 of the original.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This Robin Hood seemed a lot better than the ones in the past. Errol Flynn is my original favorite Robin Hood.... Russel Crowe is my second... sorry Kevin Costner, your now number 4 since Men in Tights is number 3. :D
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a guy! And what an adventure! This is a story of what we would all like to be doing at 100 years old! He'd had enough of being stifled and off he went back into the world and into mayhem that ended, well, won't tell you.
B00005JSGK|5.0|John Wayne movie.... need I say more? I guess I do since it won;t let me submit on those few words. hahahaha
B004P4KMSC|5.0|This is a great little truck.  My 4 1/2 year old grandson loves it.  It's sturdy, entertaining, and really nice looking.  Fine details.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Green Arrow weekly show....... I enjoy watching this show each episode. A bit corny at times, but then again most hero flics like this do tend to be a bit on the corny side at times. Other than that, the plot is good, the actors are sexy and can actually act, and the over-all sense of the show feels good to watch. :D I love it!!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|that was pretty much a wasted $4.00  the only redeaming value was Milla. The movie had very few funny parts. The trailors spoilded every funny part that could have been.<br /><br />save you money.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Gotta love a cartoon about the bad guy finding a heart. lol Especially when the kids are so cute and tag at his cold heart. The Unicorn at the fair part was awesome. lol IT'S SOO FLUFFY!!! LOL
B008YWY0HK|5.0|What an absolutely delightful movie for young and old!  I loved the \\"new\\" version of a Disney princess ... she's got a little bit of attitude, can think, has athletic skills and is a cute as a button, with sensational hair!  Completely entertaining in every respect, and a great movie for moms and daughters.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|I never get tired of watching John Wayne movies over and over. Especially a movie with Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson..... I may only be 30 years old but I remember my mom and her parents listening to Dean Martin music and Ricky Nelson songs all the time growing up. Rat Pack fan in the making as a kid. :D Both my grandpa's are big John Wayne fans and enjoy his movies, to this day my dads dad is 96 years old and loves listening to old Dean Martin and watching John Wayne movies.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writing is juvenile but the sex scenes make up for it! Very repetitive in descriptions, actions and dialogue. Only recommended for the highly descriptive sex scenes
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I love Matrix series and on blue ray picture quality is awesome. Also this pack has nice extras as well.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I HAD to read these to see what all the fuss was about. Apparently, the fuss is only about the sex because the writing is very juvenile. How many times can she (or anyone else) &#34;roll their eyes&#34; and say &#34;oh my&#34;. Very repetitive and boring... until you get to the sexy parts, then it's like a different writer took over. If it wasn't for that aspect I wouldn't have read past the first chapter of book one..
B009LXEBD4|5.0|this cd is really great. it has all her hits, we all know the words already from the radio, as well as a few new songs. the new songs are pretty good, but really i love the hits and haven't made it past listening to them over and over again yet. and of course i got two...one for me and one for mom!!
B009439HEY|4.0|Incredible re-imaging of Genesis by the fret board master.  Even the vocals at times try to emulate Peter Gabriel, which can be good or bad.  Personal favorites are Suppers Ready and all the cuts from the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Standout cuts include Miss Marlene, Good Stuff, and Weather In My Head, but all tracks are solid.  A must have item, period!!!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I got this for my mom who saw him on the show. She LOVES IT, my brother LOVE IT and I LOVE IT!!  Mom takes it in the car with her, plays it at least 5 times a week sometimes more, since it came out!<br />Phillip Phillips is an AMAZING artist, I can not wait to see what he does as he gains experience!  Really all I can say about him is WOW!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought the firts and season for my son. I never really watch the program, until seeing some of the episodes from the second season. Now the whole family is hooked. Can't wait for the 3rd season to be released on DVD.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|So first things first, this game works fantastic on my kindle fire, not sure how it would fare on a smaller device.<br /><br />The graphics are good, intentionally cartoony but crisp and clear except for the gems which look oddly more pixelated/blocky than the rest of the game.  Nice bright colors though. The controls are simple and limited, your \\"bean\\" character you control is constantly jumping at an even pace, you have left and right arrows which move the character, and as a sidescroller the screen is moved as well. Simple, yet more about timing and quick planning, not so much about button mashing; there is no time limit though so it's not stressful, but you have different goals you can achieve depending on how difficult you wish to make each level. However, I felt controlling the character was a little finicky, that may have been intentional to add difficulty though.<br /><br />Basically the game reminds me of a simplified Mario bros, or better compared to Commander Keen when you're on a pogo, so it's fun in its simplicity. However, with all the options for games I don't know if the list price is best suited, certainly worth a buck or maybe two though. I don't see any crazy permissions, or ads, or links to buy junk that is necessary just to complete levels, so it's always worth a little bit to get apps that are full games on their own, so maybe it is worth the list price for that aspect alone.<br /><br />And I've gotta say, and this might not be a popular decision (then again look at all the auto-downvoting that goes on with these android app reviews anyways, which I don't understand), but I don't see anything \\"racist\\" about this game. Being set with a theme is different from being racist; you play a Mexican jumping bean with a Mexican sombrero with a Mexican name; if that's racist I must have missed something. Merely having a few aspects of a culture doesn't make something racist, there is no negative stereotype here. You're not \\"racing to the border\\" as one troll review says (although I will admit that was kinda funny) or anything like that, you jump around collecting gems (unless there's something racist about that I've never heard of?) and end each level hitting a \\"goal\\" springboard (are springboards racist too now?). Anyways, just throwing it out there that this isn't some racist game that will teach negative stereotypes unless you wish to take it that way.oll review says (although I will admit that was kinda funny) or anything like that, you jump around collecting gems (unless there's something racist about that I've never heard of?) and end each level hitting a \\"goal\\" springboard (are springboards racist too now?).

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really. enjoy this game. I play it to pass time. I also play it before bed it puts me to sleep.
B0091QS88K|4.0|Our daughter loves playing the game, and seeing how fast she can cook the items.  I wish more levels were included for free but oh well.
B0060D31N4|5.0|Mirren and the whole cast is wonderful.  Taymore again brings us a visually exciting and deep version of Shakespeare.<br />Magic
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I am not a big movie critic, thus all you will get is my initial impression.<br /><br />I am a Star Trek, Star Wars,Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, and action movie lover.  The movie may have had silly moments where the acting skills made my eyes roll; however, I found this movie overall fun to watch and the special effects on par with modern movies.  A recommended buy for anyone who enjoys  aliens/space SCI Fi movies.
B0085W09ME|2.0|this is ok for some one who does a lot of traveling. but i don't thiank it is for me
B002CYRROY|5.0|Really Quiet Fans<br />12mm Fans hard to find<br /><br />They come with a Molex to 4-Pin adapter in case you need one.<br /><br />They are still working nicely over the 4~5months i have them installed.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This microphone made things so much easier for me to Talk . It doesn't make a lot of blanks or have a lot of static or feedback
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My family and I came across The Piano Guys just over a year ago and have been avid fans ever since.  We pre-ordered this album and have not been disappointed.  It is fantastic!  I love that my kids get as excited about the music and videos as I do.  Plus, I feel great knowing that they are listening to truly uplifting and technically advanced music that improves their minds.  My husband and I have enjoyed Jon Schmidt and his concerts in the past, but the entire family loves the Piano Guys.  As great as the album and videos are, nothing beats one of their live concerts.  If you ever have the chance--GO!
B009K6DKTS|4.0|Taleb's treatment of an essential topic in today's world is passionate erudite and well researched. He writes in accessible anecdotal language and yet conveys a compelling message that we need to heed if we are to live better personal and professional lives as well as better lives as global citizens.<br /><br />The main themes are repeated regularly but each re-visit is accompanied by new anecdotes and some new data. I love his book and at the same time I'm not sure I'd want to be his son!<br />Martin Ringer<br />Director, Group Institute International
B0055SWM08|5.0|A real gem, especially for the price. &quot;Zen&quot; is a good way to describe it. Simple concept but never really boring. Warning: far more addictive than some if your classic puzzle games - bejeweled, etc.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it. Lots of positive comments every time I talked to him. Was a big hit!
B008MM9630|4.0|enjoy the game except for how quickly you run out of energy. also can't get new updates for kindle fire.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Very Entertaining, held my niece's attention the entire time! Hilarious at times and sweet and meaningful at other moments. Very good! Highly recommend!
B000002ADT|5.0|I own only one jazz album, and it's Kind Of Blue by Miles Davis. Safe to say I'm not much of a jazz fan? Quite frankly, I have to be in the mood to listen to jazz. I love to listen to this jazz album when I want to relax, but I've discovered that I love it more and more each time in terms of musicianship and structures. This album touches all of the senses and manages to seduce the listener into a world of unique sounds highlighted by brass and bass. If there is such a thing as a 'perfect' album to have in ANYONE'S collection, it would be this one; it's an album that generates appreciation some 50+ years after it was released. For the youngsters, it's an album that they can grow into as the years pass. While all of the tracks are stellar, I particularly like BLUE IN GREEN and ALL BLUES the most. For music aficionados and particularly those who love jazz, this album is required listening. 10/10.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great clock &amp; alarm for Kindle Fire. Easy to set-up and problem-free. Don't know what the 1 and 2 star reviewers are complaining about!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Stranded on Mars by a freak dust storm, the main character keeps a journal describing his efforts to overcome near impossible odds and survive.  His survival depends on his engineering skills, his botany skills, and the fact that he is an irreverant smartass.  This last aspect gets quite entertaining at times, and I broke down laughing on more than one occasion.  Engineers should enjoy this book, as it describes how every single piece of available equipment and material is broken down and repurposed to assure survival, and the protaganist is called upon to solve seemingly implacable obstacles with thoughtful (and often wildly dangerous) technological fixes on multiple occasions.  Profanity enters into the equation, but seriously, no matter how upbeat the person is, who wouldn't break out swearing occasionally if forced to live on a world that is constantly trying to kill him?  And where the only recordings he has for entertainment are disco music and 70's TV shows?<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a deep read, but it was a fun read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Compared to Tolkien, Lord of the Rings (which I love very much), this novel is up to date in the sense of drama, but not to the same depths when it comes to background history and completeness of the universe the author has created. It is a bit like comparing the latest James Bond (Skyfall) with say en earlier film, say Moonraker. Both of these movies I will rate to 5 stars, but they are very different.<br />But maybe my view will change when I finish reading the rest.
B000AP04MO|5.0|This is a  classic movie of the time period. If you love romance, this movie is for you. Well done Al and Audrey.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This whole album is awesome! I love every song on it. The songs range in tempo where some are slower and some are faster and more upbeat. I reccommend this to anyone and everyone who likes Maroon 5!
B0094LYBT2|1.0|This movie was suggested to me by an ER nurse. She felt so strongly about the movie that we rented it that same evening. It os immediately apparent that the movie would have a great message for parents (dads) but the acting was so terrible we just couldn't make it.
B005AERS74|4.0|I bought this album because I love Overexposed. It is good, but not as good as Overexposed. This seems to be when Maroon 5 music got a little more upbeat and dancy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!!! I have it installed on my iPhone and my Kindle Fire...great way to add to your boards and kill some time.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I liked Phillip Phillips on American Idol so I thought I would give his album a try. He sounds just like Dave Matthews to be, but a little easier to understand! Lots of guitar, which I love!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this series is fantastic.  i could have been more satisfied with the ending if it had felt like we were &#34;experiencing&#34; the resolution more than being told about it.
B00797MB0O|3.0|This movie was both funny and uncomfortable. I initially liked it because the character Mavis reminded me of someone I knew in h.s. who also chased an old boyfriend around. Theron does a great job of portraying a misguided, mentally unstable character. She is the beautiful, shallow girl who never emotionally developed, hence why she is a Y.A. writer.<br /><br />She is terribly unhappy, an alcoholic who wants to believe that she is free because she has shunned marriage and family. She makes it her goal to liberate her high school boyfriend Buddy from his otherwise happy marriage and new baby. The dream of getting back together with Buddy somehow might satisfy the longing for what she never had, but could have had if she had done things differently and made different choices.<br /><br />I am rating this movie a 3 because it might be a masterpiece, not sure, still processing it. Mavis definitely represents a demographic I have seen as I am in the same age group--the beautiful woman who partied in the city, had one night stands instead of deep relationships, who focused on appearance and having a good time (which descends into alcoholism). Now she finds herself childless, unmarried, aging, and despite all the years has not developed any sort of moral compass as to what is really important in life. In that way, Mavis is very representative of a particular type of person in our culture.<br /><br />She believes everyone from her hometown is inferior yet asks herself how they can be happy with so little. She is unable to learn the lessons that she needs to in order to grow as a human being. It is comedic and tragic. Theron is truly a great actress.
B003O86FMW|5.0|love love the hunger games.  this book is fantastic.  the worst thing about it is the cliff hanger at the end.  you must keep reading!
B002VECM72|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It is heart felt and great acting.  It's a true story which makes the movie so much more special.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i really love this book series.  collins has given a fresh look and a new idea.  don't avoid this because you think the violence with children is disgusting.  you'd be missing the whole point.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Christina Aguilera is an awesome singer and I bought the movie because I enjoy listening to her sing.  The movie is sexy and it does have a ok plot but I bought it for the dancing and singing.
B004HW7JMY|1.0|This product has been supplied at the wrong region for Australia and will not work in player. Dissapointing that better region checks are not made.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Bought this movie for my husband.  The first one is definitely better (we think) but this one is good too.
B0072OFOM6|1.0|This product has been supplied at the wrong region for Australia and will not work in player. Disappointing that better region checks are not made.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I am a huge Maroon 5 fan.  I am very happy with my purchase. I think it is their best cd yet.
B003PIUC02|1.0|This product has been supplied at the wrong region for Australia and will not work in player. Disappointing that better region checks are not made at time of order.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Loved this movie! Entertaining, imaginative, adventurous. David Bowie is convincing and entertaining as the Goblin King and Jennifer Connelly's character speaks to many teenage girls.
0374531269|5.0|This book held my attention from the beginning to the end.  Hard to believe children are forced to live through such horrors. Loved the ending!
B0000AUHQF|5.0|The product arrived on time and it was in perfect conditions. I am truly satisfied with it. Thanks a lot.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|What I nice game. I really enjoyed Star Wars!!! Definitively enjoying Angryyy Birdsss!!! You should try and see for yourself
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It was funny orginal and kept me laughing. the movie over all was one I would buy and watch over and over again
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I was expecting a juvenile stupid comedy. Mostly because thats what all the previews feature. It started out that way and I laughed several times. As the movie progressed, the whole story changed into a bad love triangle soap opera between Ted, Mark Walhberg and his girlfriend Mila. I stopped laughing and started groaning. If you're looking for silly stupid comedy, look elsewhere.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I like most of Rod Stewart's new albums and his Christmas one doesn't disappoint....I am enjoying it very much....if you like Rod Stewart, you will enjoy this album!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Worth watching for the visual effects, fight scenes and special effects. Plot line was a little difficult to follow. Overall it was average.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. I am sad that I finished it and will read the next one. I'm excited to start the next.
B0086700CM|5.0|I actually really like this game a lot its fun and challenging:) the graphics are pretty neat and I love all the features of it its a great app.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is pure Connelly and Bosch.  If you are a fan you'll love it.  Great plot.  Keeps you hooked until the end.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I expected this to be really juvenile but it surprised me. Definately kept my attention even though it isn't very well written. I can forgive the writing because the action kept coming. Reminiscent of the Roman Empire in a futuristic setting.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As a Clancy fan I was not disappointed.  In addition to connecting me back to the characters I am fond of, it has a great plot that keeps you reading.  One of those books you can't put down.
B004X4QW42|1.0|There was no sound on the video download version and it was a little grainy.  The one star was mainly for the time wasted trying to figure out how to turn on the sound.
B009LREA1S|5.0|The downloading in the middle of the show needs to be fixed. If you can't fix it I will not use it.
0811870413|5.0|This has been my bible for bread making. I have copied pages so I cook from those rather than book!
B000ATQYT2|4.0|My all time favorite Christmas movie, but<br />song \\"The Love is Gone\\" is missing in blu-ray<br />version. What's up with that?[[ASIN:B008NB0SQO The Muppet Christmas Carol (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray)I have purchased from Amazon.com
0307352145|5.0|I love this book.  I'm recommending it to friends.  It explains many things I've never understood, or observed but didn't link to introversion/extroversion.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I prefer full-screen editions, but don't think it was offered.  It may be my fault and the movie itself is fine.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This did not disappoint.  Phillip Phillips is great.  I've followed him since his first Idol audition, and have waited for this, his first full CD.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|The guys and gals have really outdone themselves this time! It was great to see a grown up Peaches, to meet Sids family - especially Granny, and to see the happy ending! As always, there are several great lessons built into the story. I'm not sure who enjoyed the movie more, me or the little one!
B005NQ94KS|3.0|And boring. It jumped around so much that I never did feel a connection with the characters or the plot. After the \\"climax\\" the movie still kept moving along through 2 or 3 more years. Ugh.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is a great application.  At first I was just doodling some 8-bit or stick figures to send my wife tiny comics, but then I picked up a touch pen that worked on my android, iPhone and iPad and suddenly I had a fully featured art program.  I think something like this should come standard from the major carriers because it is so easy to use and encourages creativity.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|The game offered very little challenge. The game over in several hours.  Some new characters were introduced. Even so,the game was worth it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I picked this one up just to look at play mechanics and a week later I was still playing it.  My wife then started stealing my phone so she could play it too.<br /><br />Great purchase, looking for future enhancements.
B004EVNPGM|5.0|Awesome.  It beats most of the music out there today that only wimps & cries Boo hoo.  That is for sure.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Still lost quite a bit of functionality even on my iPad.  This is a great document viewer, and is fast even on the older iPhones.  Unfortunately it is not a replacement if you need to enter information.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I used to love this game until it lost all my progress at level 57. Started over but I cant play for more than a minute when it freezes and kicks me out. So frustrated I uninstalled it. Reported my loss of progress but all I got was an auto reply. Horrid customer service!!!!!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Much better than expected.  You have to see to believe.  You cannot take your eyes away from the screen or you will some important details to the story.  Bane does not match the Joker, but he comes very close.  5 stars
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this games its the BEST game ever!!!!!!!<br />Leps World is just like Mario and Mario is the best game u could have!!!!!!
B009PXNFQE|5.0|OMG, I have to say, this is one on P!nk's best albums yet.  All the songs on here are brilliant.  I have loved her work since she first started 'cuz you can related to everyone of her song.  She writes & sings from the heart which is what most artists don't do.  I would defiantly recommend this to anyone that LOVES music
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Quite well written, very pleasantly surprised for something that just showed up in my Amazon Kindle recommended list.  Currently reading the later entries into the story, still going strong!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie was not as good as the previous movie.  It would be hard to be the Joker played by Heath Ledger.  That was in part what made that movie so good.  But all in all, this movie is still a fairly good movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I thought it was pretty good, I really enjoyed the funny spots and of course The Hulk.  I am looking forward to the sequel.
0060734191|5.0|The way Garth Nix visualizes magic, the art of necromancy, and even death is astounding and original. The world of the Abhorsen is so rich with mystery and unique ideas, you'll read through the whole trilogy in days and then look for more.<br /><br />Each of the three books has its strengths, but there isn't a weak spot in the trilogy. This series is my first recommendation to anyone who loves fantasy. The books are equally as fascinating now as they were when I read them in my teens.<br /><br />Buy this box set, love it thoroughly (there's no question that you will), and then check out Nix's other work. I've read the Keys to the Kingdom series, which I also recommend, and can't wait to move on to his other books!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film, the action, the story, the ending of this trilogy.  I can't wait for Superman as I believe he is the best superhero.
030759565X|5.0|I've been devoted to this blog for a couple years now, and am thrilled to own the cookbook. I've made several of Deb's recipes, and every recipe I've made has always worked perfectly and been delicious. She is a reliable 'brand.' The best part of her recipes - for me at least - is the fact that most are family friendly, but are also sophisticated enough to serve to guests. This is a balance I am always looking for, as I have a toddler, and Deb must get that since she also has a toddler. I should also mention that I used to promote cookbooks for a rival publisher, and NEVER buy cookbooks from other publishers, but I made an exception for this one. I love it and I know you will too!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Just perfect for hooking up my older backup drive to my new IMac. Installed it quickly and have been taking it for granted ever since.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|This product is exceptional technically in audio and visual reproduction of the Academy award nominated film.  Purchasing this film if you like it is a good idea.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Great movie for a fun girl's night in!  With a half decent plotline, giving the main characters a depth you wouldn't expect from this kind of movie.
B000000OQF|5.0|The best ablum ever....powerful music & words that are still on in today's world as Welcome to the jungle...<br />All the 5 together were a soul mate band , so talented  singer and musicians...<br />Guns and Roses have that capability to create songs by putting down lyrics that actually mean something..for them<br />and that can be interpreteted by everyone,  songs that make you think.<br />songs that you can listen many times..without being bored ..because it's real music, not like some others band<br />who put down some words just to sell and that just don't mean anything.<br /><br />Guns and Roses are Great, Real SINGER & MUSICIANS , just Great, Real ARTISTS
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|YAY! OH HOW I DO LOVE THIS FLICKAROO!  And wow.  this is annoying.  7 more words are required. and done.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This latest release could be argued is their best work ever.  Their musicianship is unparallelled in this album and the concept album is just perfect.  Saw them in concert this year in Bridgeport - they were un-believable.  Having the string group on stage with them was truly awesome and lent a different feel to their live performance...it was not a recorded back track but actual live performers on stage.  Very cool. From the opening track Caravan to the mind blowing, heart touching conclusion The Garden, this album is just hit after hit for RUSH fans of all ages.  I believe I read they are going to be recording 1 or 2 shows live for another DVD/Blu Ray release - I will surely buy that when it comes out.  I know these guys are getting up there in age but man they still can rock.  Congrats on FINALLY getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I know they said it did not matter to them but I think something inside is saying 'Finally'.  They sound like they will graciously accept the honor and if there is a R&R HOF Induction concert and they are playing I know I will do my best to watch...
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Hands down one of the best testosterone-fueled cult classic flicks ever. The fake blu ray menu intro idea is smart too
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The whole presentation is wonderful ! The picture images are so clear.<br /><br />The special features disc was enjoyable also.<br /><br />We were surprised to recieve the extra disc that can be used on regular T V along with the blue ray disc.<br /><br />Thanks for offering this beautiful classic.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham....what an imagination!  Just when you think you are on the right track, it's off in another direction.  Great read.
B000084HAJ|5.0|Fabulous soloists, choir, orchestra and not at least the Basilica di San Marco, Venice!! A really divine experience. Relax and enjoy!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I've only read the first two in the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; series, but enjoyed this one. There are a lot of twists, turns and action.  He's a great character to follow on adventures!  Looking forward to the next one.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I like being able to stream the content. It looked great even on a low speed connection over seas.<br /><br />thanks
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is all hype. I know there are true followers of Angry Birds, but I am not one of them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game - beautiful graphics and music, and the puzzles are just challenging enough. And the issues with the multiple requests to rate the game seem to be fixed. I was asked politely, just once. Nicely done!
B0045XKJBI|5.0|I don't think this series can really be explained. It is a phenomenon that I am baffled by, but truly enjoy
B003VR5PPY|3.0|I was realy enjoying this game. New to a game reading like a book or TV show.  But OOH how I hated the end. Won't give it away but it reminded me of reading a book and missing the last chapter.  What a shame cause it was an interesting game.

B005DMNS4A|5.0|I have owned the vinyl, the 1996 CD and now the 2011 Deluxe CD version. This is the best, clearest and most balanced of the lot. Nothing shrill or brittle (unlike a lot of cds  AND some remastered discs too!) This was done with loving care...it's Townshend's baby, so he was trying to get it perfect this time. It is. No need to say how good the actual body of work is because this is-if you are a Who fan-in their top three...a masterpiece. Why get it if you already have the 1996 version?...clearly better sound, you will hear things that were partially buried in the mix, there's more space where there needs to be, better imaging...an all around sonic treat!  Give your 1996 cds away to your 17 year old nephew...he'll appreciate The Punk Meets The Godfather (and all the rest!)
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This was downloaded to my kindle and I have to say I have watched it at least a dozen times since
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I received this in good time, my only problem was that it might have been a little defective as it is a little bit tough to insert the camera memory card in the one. piece.  Other than that, it works just fine, but that is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game was okay, but I found a better, more user friendly version quickly and removed this one from my system
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have read every single DeMille book published and thoroughly enjoyed each and every one.  Until now....that is!  I kept looking at the book to make sure I didn't buy a travel guide of Yemen.  The story dragged on and on with very little action until the Panther was dispatched on almost the last page.  Being a native New Yorker, I loved the John Corey character in previous editions, but this time I got very tired and disgusted of his wise-cracks in each and every paragraph.  I'm not sure that I look forward to the next DeMille book.
