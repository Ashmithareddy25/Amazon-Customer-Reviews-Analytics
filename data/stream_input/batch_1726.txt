B0015346OM|5.0|I did expect to find the horrors of war in the book and just hoped I could make it through.  I found it horrific but did make it through. What I did not expect was such an accurate portrait of tribalism and political backwash.  The unexpected part of the book was the tremendously well researched and objective descriptions of the mental and cultural positions of the Somalians, the warlords, the diplomats and the soldiers.  I only hope this is required reading for all our Dept of State and military leaders.  The logic of tribal cultures is not logical to democratic nations and will not respond to the promise of freedom or the threat of military action.  This lesson will be repeated over and over in the Middle East and Africa until we realize we can't free them from their feudal ways.  Only they can change themselves.  At the same time, it does do some good to take out a few warlords and his henchman who are particularly cruel and inhumane and give the people room for change! Go Black Hawks!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play the PC version on my laptop and think that the conversion from PC to Aneroid is great. It obviously took a lot of time and effort to make which is probably the reason it came out later than for Apple products. If you love MC but are on the go a lot, this app is great. I have this same app for my iPad and personally believe its better for Kindle Fire. Reason is because the Kindle has great size proportions that apply to the far apart controls. I hope this review brought you everything you need to know. Peace gamers.<br />~S.K.

0679805273|4.0|We bought this based on a P!nterest idea that has your child's teachers (from his or her first grade level) up until high school or college) sign it like a yearbook.  So someday when your child is 18 or 22 they can open it and see personal notes from teachers that elicit the fond memories of toddler-hood and elementary years.  If you're going to get this for your graduating child someday, get it when they're little and have their teachers sign a note as they end their school year.  Just find a good hiding place for it for 18-22 years.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I consider myself pretty informed, but I had no idea that I was so ignorant about the subprime mortgage crisis. This postmortem of the financial system is both entertaining and alarming. I found myself rooting for the market to go bust and vindicate the few clear headed individuals with the wherewithal to actually learn something about the subprime bond market.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|so far I feel that this is one of the best places to get your weather from. It's fast and easy. you can get it from any location. now you don't have to use the Tv. I rate about four stars.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This version is very versatile.  Love the plans included in the program. The voice which reads to you us not metallic like others I've heard. Very easy to listen to.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It reminds me of Peter Parker from spider man. and by the looks of its cover it looks pretty cool. so I would rate it about four stars.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|So, I discovered Firefly in what is likely the opposite way of many.  I love Nathan Fillion in Castle, so I started looking into his filmography.  After watching all of the too few episodes of Firefly and the movie, Serenity, in a ridiculously short period of time, I count myself among the Firefly fans!  This show has the perfect amount of humor, adventure, action, and darkness.  Watch it and you will not be disappointed!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Hilarious. Fun. Really entertaining. I really liked this movie and would watch it again. The storyline was cute, the animation really well-drawn, and those little yellow things are so funny. That's all that needs to be said. Watch it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|like that i can choose how i want to play fun like having options  and can play different levels of strength
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Sylvia Day's, Reflected in You:  A Crossfire Novel, was a great extension of Bared to You.  I was a bit concerned after reading the first book because I thought it was a lot like 50 Shades of Grey but I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns in this book.  I did have to go back and almost re-read the first book because I had forgotten some of the details.  The characters are quite complicated and I found myself taking sides throughout the book.  Day offers a lot of passion filled love scenes and enough drama to keep me wanting more.  All in all, I couldn't stop reading when I started and was sucked in immediately; however I was a bit frustrated by the fact that the 3rd book won't be out until Spring!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of the most funniest most beautiful books I have ever read I hope you feel the same way for beautiful disaster.
B007TK77QE|1.0|While the story was intriguing, and I am a huge HP fan, who couldn't fault that series, I found this book very difficult to get into and follow.  In the early pages I was turning back to refer to who was whom.  More than once I felt like giving up on the story, or worse, going straight to the back to see how it ended.  Very pleased I didn't in the end though.<br />Long, drawn out sentences with unusual words, made me think more than once that JKR was trying to get her word count up.<br />I had read other reviews before making my purchase, and didn't want to believe them, hoping I could add something more positive, which, sadly I can't.<br />If you are into gossip and the sad way that people fill their daily lives, this book may be to your taste, but its not my preferred style.
B0079J27SS|3.0|Here we have a great conductor of the old school leading a fabulous and refined orchestra in Mozart's last six great symphonies. And it does not disappoint. Although this is decidedly `big-band' Mozart, unencumbered by any vestige of historic practice, it has its own merits of grace, proportion and supreme balance. Just don't expect it to sound like - say - Mackerras's fine set. That doesn't worry me, I grew up with this performance style and it seems to me still valid; there is always more than one way of playing great music, after all. So, that's 5 stars for the music...<br /><br />And one star for the sound. Sorry. Like all of EMIs 2012 remasterings, this is very much a lost opportunity to transfer some of EMI's vast and irreplaceable classical archives onto modern, high-resolution digital sound. That's being charitable; in actuality, EMI has butchered the sound. Any competent sound engineer avoids lossy signal processing unless absolutely necessary. Instead of this sensible practice, we have here the analogue tape masters converted to (merely) 96KHz/24bit format, DSP including ghastly open-ended CEDAR noise processing when they feel like it, A/D conversion and analogue domain filtering (!) before final DSD mastering.<br /><br />Any idiot can tell you the consequences of this. Or, better still, listen to the analogue vinyl originals on a good high-end system. On vinyl, all sorts of nasty RIAA EQ, compression and cutting problems affected the sound, so SACD should be a far superior representation of the master tape. Shouldn't it?  If done well, the answer is yes. But on the EMIs, the original vinyls blow these SACDs out of the water, big-time.<br /><br />It's the subtle, low-level stuff that suffers here due to EMIs poor practice, of course. The sound is scrubbed of all that nasty ambience, air, hall sound and detail. Instead, we get a sterile, antiseptic and airless simulacrum of the sound. And, worst of all, the strings screech rather than glow.<br /><br />That's it for me, I'm afraid. The sound has ruined for me this entire series of recordings. I just hope they come to their senses at some time in the future, and convert as directly as possible from analogue tape master to DSD, with the minimum of additional signal intervention; this is, after all, now accepted good practice, and it's what virtually everyone else in the business of remastering golden-age analogue classics now does.<br /><br />If they don't do it right, though, we lose a generation of fine sound and great performances. That's just tragic.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was interested from the beginning.  My daughter couldn't read it because she has just had a baby and the content bothered her.  I liked it though.
1469984202|5.0|This is the first self-published book I have ever read, and I admit to having had my doubts.  (I'm a Harvard grad and a former English major, so I will dutifully confess to the occasional bout of literary snobbery.) Now, having blazed through the entire thing in fewer than 10 days, I can honestly say that every single publishing house editor who turned this down should be fired.  Now.  It is inconceivable to me how someone could read this and not see how good it is.  Howey is a compelling, lucid writer, and the story grabs you by the throat from the beginning.  The characters are terrific, the story immersive and propulsive, the world well thought-out.  I've heard this compared to the Hunger Games, and that feels right.  I couldn't put those books down either.  Howey deserves every cent he earns on these books.  I just hope he decides to write a sequel, because I am dying to know what happens next in that world.  Bravo!
1432794426|5.0|Thought-provoking and eye-opening, this is a book to pull off the shelf again and again in pursuit of the increasingly fleeting truth of Michael Jackson's life. \\"Defending a King\\" is both well-researched and appropriately respectful of the late pop icon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent writer brought an engaging series to an meaningful end.  All three books were well written and she kept the story line intact throughout.  I purchased the kindle version and it was fine-no complaint- and I am glad to have it my digital libtrary for future re-reads.
B007M45PMU|5.0|what a great buy.  never heard of them except listening to the samples on Amazon and reading the reviews.  bought it on a whim and don't regret it at all.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual, Lee Child has done a good job of developing characters and plot, with just enough twists to keep from being too predictable.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is great. I've gotten a perfect score on almost all the levels except the last few boxes. I think its an awesome app. No glitches at all. Woos great on kindle fire.

B0098VXE50|3.0|This is a very pretty film that I found to be very boring. My wife liked it better but this could have been so much better with a different choice in cast and directors. The actress from the Twilight series is especially bad. She mumbles throughout and she always looks as if she just woke up. The real star of this movie is the special effects. They dominate every scene and seem to be used as a replacement for good script and acting.
B0088TG252|5.0|Denzel does it again! Ryan is awesome! Best movie I have seen in a long time. Get the popcorn and put up your feet and ENJOY!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|A real joy of a film. Wes Anderson created a delightful slightly off kilter world where the mundane becomes monumental and this movie very much reminded me of the \\"The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters\\". Anderson always seems to draw the best from the actors in his films but he's really outdone himself here. I don't think any actor stole the show but its amazing that this is the first film roles for the two primary child actors.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|I cant get this app to download!!!!!!!! however I'm gonna feel dealt stupid if this doesn't work on kindlefires ..... please help someone!!!!!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is remarkably faithful to the book, which I read after seeing the movie. Both motivated me to acquire the last two volumes.  If other viewers are fearful about the theme of \\"children killing children\\" in the movie, they might find that reading all three books of the trilogy leads to a positive and hopeful conclusion.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|This is one of the must haves for blues.  I love playing this for people and having them guess who it is.  Noone does.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|The story weaves back and forth through time, but the connections among the several stories are subtle and hard to follow--especially on Kindle when one cannot page back and forth easily to check. However, the worst part of the book for me was how fatalistic it is. Sigh.
B0080R7Q70|4.0|It's been a while since the Flower Kings of had an album out.  (2007)  Since then, they've acquired a new drummer in Felix Lehrmann.  Felix seems to fit the band well both in playing and personality.<br /><br />The opening track is the 25 minute \\"Numbers\\", which is somewhat reminiscent of old-school Genesis. A nice mix of rock/jazz/metal/etc  That's the good thing about the Flower Kings, they mix it up and incorporate several styles.  The rest of the album follows suite, but the tracks aren't nearly as long.  (Only about 5-7 minutes.)<br /><br />One added bonus, is the bonus DISC.  I personally find the tracks on the bonus disc quite entertaining.  They're pretty upbeat for the most part and give you that \\"feeling\\" that only the Flower Kings can.  (Don't know what you call it?  Someone will have to invent a word for it?)  Funny thing, someone mentioned that \\"Fireghosts\\" (on the bonus disc) sounds kind of like Neal Diamond.  In a humorous way, it's sorta true.  (Don't let that scare you.  I've been to 2 Neal Diamond concerts.  They freakin' ROCK!)<br /><br />If you're already a Flower Kings fan, you should already have this.  If you don't, you SHOULD.<br /><br />So that's it.  My reviews are lame.  The album isn't.  Buy it.  It's a good deal, especially considering it's a double disc.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A story that keeps your interest throughout. I loved the writing and descriptions, the stories of the child's foster homes, the significance of flowers, the relationships of the characters. Thank you Vanessa Diffenbaugh for a favorite book over this last year of reading.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with this movie the story lagged on and the action was short for my taste was hoping for more of a story.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I WAS CAPTURED AT THE START OF THIS STORY AS I'D NOT READ A FORMAT SUCH AS THIS. IT WAS INTRIGUING SWITCHING FROM PAST TO PRESENT AT AN UNRELENTING PACE. THE WRITER DRAWS YOU IN AS YOU GO DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE UNFOLDING OF IT'S HORROR. I BEGAN TO FEEL THE RAZOR-SHARP EDGE OF EMOTION AND FOUND MY READING BEGIN TO RACE PERHAPS  IN AN ATTEMPT TO SOMEHOW MOLLIFY THE CHARACTERS.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE...THIS IS NOT A BOOK TO BE READ AT BEDTIME. IT IS RAW, GRAPHIC AND MOST DISTURBING. YES, IT IS FICTION BUT ONE WOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN LA-LA LAND TO NOT KNOW IT IS ALL TO TRUE .<br />.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I was disappointed, The first Ghost Rider was a 4 star movie much better actors than the second movie I would think that Nicolis would have chosen a better movie to act in..
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is fun and easy to play but on my phone (Sprint evo) the menus don't fit the screen so it cuts off the bottom where the buttons are to continue playing. it won't let you scroll down either so I can't download room content like it wants you to. which means I can't open any new rooms besides the first 3. so I'm stuck and its very frustrating that I can't press the download button. it also takes forever to select one of the rooms, I feel like I have to click on the room a ton of times for it to actually open. if they fixed these problems then it would be a 5.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Great movie the special affects were outstanding, the acting was outstanding the story was impressive and all over terrific movie I hope there will be a second one.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!! IT IS NOT A ROMANTIC COMEDY! IT IS SOOOOOOO DEPRESSING! don't waste your time on this piece of junk! they are good actors, but the storyline sucks, because they do not end up together. When they are not together in the movie, the other parts bore your socks off. It just goes from bad to worse. I don't know how the critics can call this a romantic comedy! It makes me really mad when they say \\"Romantic comedy\\" on the back of the movie and then it is not even romantic! They do that for lots of bad movies.
B000002J0B|5.0|I realize it is somewhat presumptious to say it, but I believe the best rock music critics have to at least give serious consideration to the idea that Houses of the Holy is Led Zeppelin's Magnum Opus.  I think I was a HS senior when this album came out.  I don't recall the month of its release.  At any rate, I was a senior when I walked into the record store in Arvada Plaza (in Colorado) and bought it along with Dark Side of the Moon.  I played the hell out of it.  The Rain Song is quite possibly the most beautiful song performed a rock band I have heard in my lifetime.  I am not someone who uses dumb pop-psychology phrases like \\"in touch with my feminine side\\" but I get watery-eyed whenever I hear The Rain Song.  It may also be that any music that reached into you, as it were, during your teens, stays with you forever...

B000JQUKKU|5.0|The book was really good, I think it was better than the movie. I would recommend this book to adolescents or adults. I'm a 13 year old boy, and I saw the movie so I thought I might try the book. It really surprised me that the book was way better than the movie. I loved it and I would read it everywhere and at anytime. I read the book whither my brother and he's nine, and he loved the book. The book is hard to understand but you will figure it out as you keep reading. I hope my review helped you think about what to read next, and if you chose this book I hope you enjoy it.<br /><br />  Thank you.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Terrific graphics and gets more and more challenging as you tour the ancient empires around the mediterainian.  The directions are a little spartan so I had to figure out some things which was a minor annoyance.  Bottom line: if you like match 3-type games, this is a very good one.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|\\"Kingdom\\" is too grandiose.  Call it a neighborhood.<br /><br />Wes Anderson's films always remind me of the saying about Chinese food:  you feel full enough while seated at the table, but half an hour later you're hungry again.<br /><br />I would like to like this movie.  In fact, I'd like to like several of Wes Anderson's movies.  They generally start with an intriguing premise and a talented cast.  Opening scenes promise a strong story, characters we can relate to, situations that touch our emotions.  But then, somewhere along the line, the storyline blurs, characters lose their focus, connections between scenes become tenuous or downright missing.  The original concept becomes muddied, the victim of a director who can't seem to maintain his interest in a central theme for enough minutes to add up to a feature film.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom is like a book you pick up expecting a novel and instead find yourself reading a collection of vaguely related short stories.  There's no lack of humor or cleverness or emotional highlights.  But the pieces don't add up to a whole.  Call it light entertainment, which has its place in the world, to be sure, but it's disappointing if you're looking for in-depth character development or intellectual stimulation or cinematic excellence.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a trilogy! I enjoyed reading this book and the others and was sad as I was getting to the end. I found the book full of suprises and odd twists!<br /> Crazy story showing the twists of humanities thinking during an apocolyptic event! I thought ok people are depsperate but evil? I found the ideas scary and often thought provoking!! Maybe the sci-fi in the book sounds 'out there' but it makes you wonder about our future and all of the 'what ifs' as science and technology evolves today and the future of man!
B000VNMMWA|5.0|Great movie, after I got introduced to this one I just had to have it for my collection! Action packed and one of the funniest films I've seen in a while.
B001M5UDGS|2.0|Joss Whedon's 43 minute long movie, \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\", was not one of my favorites and I am not so sure that I would consider watching it again. The short film was a musical, comedy, drama, and tragedy combination which starred Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day. The actors portrayed the parts of good and evil, although you may be shocked to find which is good and which is evil by the end of the movie. Joss Whedon's production was too immature, the music was corny, the acting was awful, and the ending was not all that great.<br /><br />Joss Whedon's film, \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\", was way too juvenile for older viewers. If you are like me, you will find the good and evil part of the film to be immature and something a twelve year old boy might enjoy. Although I am personally not a fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", you might find this film to be good if you enjoy the \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" series. The television series and short film are similar to some of the episodes in the series.<br /><br />Another aspect of this short film that I am not a fan of is the music. The music seemed to me like it was out of place and ultimately corny. The choice of music reminded me of a pre-teen Disney channel movie. Although I have to admit I am not a fan of musicals, this movie might be your type if you enjoy singing along with your movie.<br /><br />The third thing that I did not care for in \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" was the acting. I am a fan of Neil Patrick Harris but I thought his role as Dr. Horrible was not one of his best. Captain Hammers' role obnoxious and Penny was the best actor in the short film.<br /><br />My fourth and final problem I had with the short film was the ending. The ending was shocking and unexpected, and not what most viewers would want to happen. Captain Hammer begins to date Penny, but will Dr. Horrible get her back and seek revenge on Captain Hammer?<br /><br />The 43 minute long movie, \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\", is a movie you will either love or hate. It all depends what type of movies you like to watch. If you enjoy a musical, comedy, drama, and tragedy combination than this short film is definitely for you.

B008G8SFGO|1.0|Question - can you name a group of men at least two of whom are old enough to be grandfathers, who prance around in spandex and high heels with their faces painted up like it's halloween?  Answer - Kiss.  I'm embarrased for them.  With a catalog as extensive (and very full of high quality songs I might add) as theirs, why do they insist on pretending it's still 1978?  Here's an idea - take off the makeup and tour smaller venues, and play a mix of electric, acoustic, retro and new songs.  That way I could attend without worrying about being embarrased if I run into someone I know there.  It's time to grow up, fellas.  I did, why can't you?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I almost gave this book 4 stars, and had I written my review right after I finished, I would have. The writing is really well done, but I was going to subtract a star for how quickly and neatly it gets wrapped up at the end. But since I finished the book, I can't stop thinking about the Silos and all the characters. There is just something about the way this book is written that really resonated with me.

B0015DWJX2|4.0|As author of [...] I read this book as research for my own, which was set on the neighboring island of Jersey during the occupation. I found a lot of useful references in here for my own novel. But more importantly here I found this book to be a funny and enjoyable romp.<br /><br />If I had any criticism, it would be that the ending came too quickly and seemed rushed, but this was by no means a major disappointment.<br /><br />I really liked the main character, but found her romance with Dawsey (where did that name come from?) to be a little forced. The real strength of this book was in the humorous writing of the letters. These are the memories that I will take from this highly enjoyable read.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|As author of [...] I read a lot of historical fiction leading up to writing my own novel. While this is not classic historical fiction, this is one of the most original books I've ever read and is a modern cult classic in the making. The person who recommended it to me said that it was the best book that they had ever read-quite a recommendation. While I wouldn't be quite so effusive with my own praise I can certainly say I enjoyed it, although some parts certainly more than others.    My favorite of the 6 novellas in one that comprise Cloud Atlas is the modern day story starring the hilarious, elderly book agent, Timothy Cavendish. This was beautifully written and charming and hilarious in equal measure.    The detective story with Luisa Rey was also entertaining. The forays into future worlds were very ambitious, and to a large extent successful. The more successful being the replicant type story set in a future Korea.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game! it is very addicting because you just don't know what will happen next and so you have to keep playing!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It takes a while to form a positive behavioral habit. I'm not there yet with this app, but it has the potential to help me manage my entrepreneurial insights outside of my regular occupation.  I have work related information and time management tools; I can use this app to manage things on the side!
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Having noticed more and more Jack Reacher books at my local airport, I thought I'd give one a go. It was awful. I thought publishers were supposed to read books before letting them loose on unsuspecting customers. I will not be reading any more Jack Reacher books. Life is just too short.<br /><br />The books failings are too many to spend time listing them all, but a quick rundown includes:<br /><br />1) Ridiculously unbelievable characters<br />2) Badly researched plot<br />3) A constant stream of \\"no doubt about it\\"<br />4) Inconsistent abilities of main character (crack shot who hits people at 100 feet with a pistol and then misses from 10 feet)<br /><br />Painful.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Great move.  I would recommend it for a family movie or to watch with a significant other.  Amazon was good at streeming it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Its free as long as you play carefully and for short peroods. Its like most free to play games that let you pay money to save time  or skip the process of waiting for more coins if you've spent them. Letting the coins be completely free would be inauthentic and make the game less challenging and each coin would count less if you had infinite coins and remove the challenge. Even in real life you only have so many coins in your pocket and the developer should make money somehow if you want more coins.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|Definitely a page turner, I could not put it down and everyone should read it to appreciate their own mind power.  The story was  intricately woven between the current mind state, the imagination and then the dreams of the main character. If you were not paying attention you would not know what vein  you were being fed from to form this memorable story and all the pieces that bring it together. BRILLIANTLY DONE!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|10/10<br /> This book has amazing plot and development<br />I couldn't stop reading it is one of the best books I have read.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was an awesome movie and one I would watch again and again.  Great plot and the characters are fantastic.  I got the four disc combo pack on Amazon for a great price and for a lower price then I was able to get anywhere else.  Great purchase!

030758836X|4.0|\\"Isn't that what every marriage is, anyway? Just a lengthy game of he said, she said?\\" Is the gist of Gillian Flynn's thriller, Gone Girl. On the morning of Amy and Nick 's fifth anniversary, Nick arrives home to find his wife gone and his home in shambles. Something horrible happened to Amy and all eyes focus on Nick. He has to be the murder, doesn't he? Told in first person accounts by Nick and Amy, Flynn offers us a glimpse into the lives of two terribly damaged people. In the closest of relationships, we see people for who they really are. And sometimes, for better or worse really is the worst.<br /><br />Gone Girl is a great example of the unreliable narrator. Each character has their own agenda. They'll lie, cheat, steal, and even murder to get what they want. In real life we wouldn't want to be in the same room with them. But that's what's great about fiction. For a few ours we invite despicable characters to play with our thought, but when the hours are up and the book closes they leave and our lives are unscathed, if only 'til the next book.<br /><br />Other unreliable narrator examples: Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Nabokov's Lolita, Palahniuk's Fight Club & Homes' The End of Alice

B000FC13MM|5.0|This trilogy is awesome.  I first came across it when my Dad gave me the hard copy of Sabriel which he got from a library book sale.  It's extremely entertaining and the 2 different worlds or rather three different worlds in this series are well developed.  I lost my hard copy, so I decided to buy the kindle version.  I've read it and the rest of the trilogy multiple times.  It's one of those stories you can keep coming back to.
0307959856|2.0|I was bought this book for a present and was so excited.  Being a big Austen fan but new to P.D James (but having only heard great things) I was really looking forward to getting lost in a book full of loved characters and suspense. Unfortunately I was always waiting for the book to get going.  The problem, for me, was that I honestly didn't care about the person who was murdered or most of the characters involved.  The characters involved were not anyone who we really cared about, were developed, or who were integral to the plot.  I feel like the author really got her grove in the last 50 pages but it just seemed the rest of the novel was a superfluous attempy for P.D James to showcase her skills and knowledge of Austen.  Unfortunately I wouldn't spend money or time on this book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|From the first page this book will grasp you and not let you go. Chris is a true American hero
B0035V35PI|5.0|What was the last good ninja movie? No, I mean a ninja movie that was true to the genra? Exactly there are none. This is by far the best ninja movie EVER made. I never heard of Rain before this movie but I love him (no homo). I love him for being apart of something that was forgotten about and was almost lost to us. There is not much I can say about the illness of this movie that hasn't already been said. I hate to say it but this will probably be the last ninja movie made Because anything not like this will fall short so nobody might as well not even try if its not like this.

B004SBQGHS|3.0|Please Amazon update this already. I'm tired of Google Play telling me there's an update available and I can't do anything about it. It's a pretty big one too. You've updated the other Angry Birds so what's with the delay. If you're gonna make the App Store available for all Android devices you really need to keep up with Google Play. People on Kindles may not know what's going on but everyone else will.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I can't believe the book is over!! So unpredictable and so addicting. I was so emotionally invested in this book... and I was left furious! Can't believe the ending! Must read!
B0026NBZEY|4.0|I simply loved \\"Tipping the Velvet\\" written by this author so I decided to try \\"Affinity\\". Not sure what to think -- except it is one strange tale! The lesbian overtones were terribly subtle. In fact, it is possible that if you did not know in advance about that fact you would not suspect. I thought the story dragged a bit but I perservered as I was simply too curious about the ending. I won't give it away - but let's just say that it was just a tad predictable - and then again, perhaps not. This book left me a bit puzzled and a little disappointed as well. I give it four stars for being well written - 3.5 would have been my overall rating. Not high up on my list of favorites but I guess it was interesting enough. Would I read another from this author? Probably -  because of her other book \\"Tipping the Velvet\\".
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|My son ask me for this book, he told me he will like it electronically, It´s easier to read, make comments and available at any time in his Galaxy tab. So i decided to buy it and inmediately he began to read  this interesting book.

B0078XHAB4|4.0|Brilliant book. Could relate to it completely after having a miscarriage myself and the book kind of helped me in some aspects. Although  Very confusing to begin with but managed to get the gist after a few chapters. but found the ending rather predictable. Could of had a better spin to the ending

1451638450|5.0|Here comes a very small spoiler from page 1- as soon as Byerly knocked on Ivan's door on page one I knew I was glad I had bought this book. The intertwining of plots involving these two characters in A Civil Campaign was marvelous fun so it set the tone for a great romp through this book. Some of the characters in this book are familiar and yet the balance of which characters are focused on completely changes the tone of this book from the others. The plot has plenty of twists and turns to hold your attention and the characters are highly entertaining. I could not put it down. I laughed a lot! And I am so pleased to see Ivan taking the lime light in his own right! So I give Bujold five stars, but I give Baen Books 1 star for not releasing directly to Kindle via Amazon. If you go to their site you find sets of instructions for a variety of really cumbersome many-step ways to get the ibook, including some that let you arrive at having it on your kindle but nothing allowing the book to download straight onto the Kindle for iPad as Amazon does it. Baen's options read like a laundry list of cumbersome 1995 options. However, I am not scoring the book based on my complaints against Baen Books because I think these scores need to be about the book and the author and not about a beef with the vendor. So Lois gets five stars and Baen gets one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season One was Good, Season Two was even better, but Season Three is proving to be the best so far! Episodes run really well on newer computers, streaming over the internet. Sound quality and picture quality are good.

B000PKW73S|5.0|This book was chosen as one of my book group reads and I must admit about groaning before starting it and going into it with a biased view.  I do not like Clint Eastwood movies and associated this book with a Clint Eastwood movie (even though I haven't even watched it) so I thought it would be everything I hated about an old fashioned, bodice swelling love story.<br /><br />I could not have been more off the ball on this.  I could not help compare the book to the classic book, Love Story by Erich Segal as it was set over a short period, it was pithy and to the point.  I thought the writing style was just divine as it flowed like a chocolate fountain and was so descriptive that I could picture each location as if I were there myself.  I am so glad he kept it short and to the point as it did not allow all the unnecessary sloppiness that is usually inserted in these types of novels and it kept it true to the short time period (a few days) that the love element actually happened.<br /><br />I have a confession!  I actually shed a tear and felt my heart breaking for the two main characters as I so wanted a happy outcome for them, even many years later.  I usually hate happy endings but this is one book that I wanted to have one.  I wasn't actually disappointed though that it didn't have a happy ending as the actual ending was just true to the overall story.  Sorry can't say more as do not want to insert a spoiler.<br /><br />So, a pleasant surprise from my original bias and a movie I now want to watch.  I guess I will try and get the book group together after the discussion to watch it.  5 out of 5 from me and if it can make a cynic like me cry then everyone else will be weeping buckets of tears!

0385535147|1.0|Cut out the middle 2/3 of book and you have a John Grisham story.  Waste of time, and not very entertaining.
0553801473|1.0|WARNING! SPOILER ALERT: The author should spend less time with the hbo series and more time with decent writing. This series started out great. It has become nothing but a mishmash of drivel by book 5.  Too many characters with no substance.. Nothing but pages of mindless meaningless words that drag on but do not advance the storyline.  If the author had stuck to the major characters and expanded upon them instead of killing them all off, the book could have been on the level of Tolkein's work. That comparison has now been lost. What is left to look forward to after the author has killed off Ned Stark, Caitlyn Stark, Joffrey, Robb Stark, Brienne,and a host of others.  Now we're left with Jon Snow stabbed 4 times and no knowledge of his fate at the end of book 5.. Is he dead or not? This is tiresome. The few remaining characters need to 'grow up' in the next book and the Stark children should be returned to Winterfell with the help of Jon Snow to rebuild. It would be perfectly legit for Tommen or some king to release Jon from his vows to the blackwatch so he could stay on as their protector along with perhaps Sam as their Maester and help Gilly raise both 'babe's, or something along those lines.  I'm just weighted down with the total chaos of this series. I keep waiting for the author to understand that we have no reason to have any kind of attachment to the books or characters when we know he's just going to kill them off anyway.. So why bother? Enough of the frivolous killing off good characters. Something good needs to happen and stay happened. lets MAKE SOME PROGRESS! I'm so disgusted with this series that I'm pretty much done with it.. If it remains this stagnant I won't be buying anymore. there was enough good material in these 5 books to have made 2, possibly 3 great books but the inclusion of so much drivel and wasted characters has expanded it to really tiresome reading. Just way too much froth. It's beginning to sound juvenile and in no way written by the same person who started the series. This author is losing his audience to anger and a angry audience won't buy his work anymore. No one wants a constant let down.  Just my humble opinion.ame person who started the series.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I've just retired my third pair of PX21s and I'll never purchase another Turtle Beach product so long as I live. A cheap piece of plastic broke on the first two pairs connecting the headphone to the band, meaning the headphones won't stay on your head anymore. Both times they broke I was just pulling the damn things off. On my third set, after about six months of use one of the wires on the inside pulled loose (I'm assuming) as the sound in the right earphone cuts in-and-out as I move my head. They will not fix this, categorizing it as wear-and-tear.<br /><br />I'm just done with this company at this point. These things are cheaply made and the company does not stand by its product. Apparently wires working themselves out as I sit on the couch for six months is a routine thing with this product. Spend the extra $20 and get the Sony Brand wireless headphones. You'll be sorry, otherwise.

B00846TRHY|5.0|Machine Gun Preacher follows Sam Childers as he changes his life from a vicious gang biker to a hopeful and helpful preacher. His journey to save the children of Sudan from the LRA (Kony) is powerful and motivational.<br /><br />First, the story is very emotional and effective; it shows how Childers changed his life, through religion, for the better and if shows the atrocities that have occurred and continue to occur in Sudan. And, although religion is a significant part of the film, Machine Gun Preacher does not force religion on to the audience, which I think some viewers will appreciate. This is the type of film that can make you happy for a moment, and make you sad, or even cry, the next moment; for example, watching the kids play soccer with a baseball as Childers tried to teach them to play was heartwarming; conversely, watching a young boy chase after his dog and accidentally hit a explosive was heartwrenching. The film also works as an action film as it uses some intense action/shootout sequences to push the story along. Gerard Butler, as Childers, was brilliant. Michael Shannon, as Donnie, was also excellent, despite his limited screen time. The music was also great, and the film was shot beatifully.<br /><br />Overall, Machine Gun Preacher is a brilliant film with a powerful message. As of 11/12/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.<br /><br />Machine Gun Preacher has strong violence and gore (including graphic violence towards children), and a brief sex scene. (no nudity, but you can see the movements)
B008KE3960|5.0|Amazon did a great job with this one. There is some parts to the game that you can pay for but in no way are they necessary to enjoy thhis unique title. Just think of flight plan meets turret defense.
0984380213|2.0|in my view the book is over hyped.  it would be great for someone just out of college-but then they would probably not have the authority to implement<br />the basics outlined in this book.  if you have more than two years of survivorship in sales this book restates the obvious.

Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, you can not go wrong.<br />Getting my movies in the combo pack, it allows everyone in the family be able to watch the movie.

B001U3Y5XE|2.0|Our 8 year old son received Lego Creationary for his birthday. He loves Legos and is very capable of following directions and completing Lego sets on his own, HOWEVER, this game is TERRIBLE.  You are given an assortment of basic bricks, nothing specialized, and then are to try to create images that are on the cards.  Let me give you some examples of what are on the EASY level cards: clouds, catapult, fire station, space ship, turtle, London Bridge, a bee, a church, a sparrow, a farm, a backhoe.  These aren't super complicated items, but imagine trying to build a turtle out of square bricks, no legs or eyes, and no good way to make a shell.  Overall I would NOT recommend this game... my son and wife are currently sitting at the table just building random things out of the pieces, but that's about all it's good for.

It sort of reminded me of Jodi Picoult because you had to wait until the very end to find out what the secret was. Once I got into it I found it difficult to put down and when I got close to the end I stayed up late to finish it.

0553801473|4.0|George R. R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE saga continues with the much-anticipated fifth in the series, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. For those not familiar with the series, these are the books on which HBO's Emmy award winning television series, GAME OF THRONES, is based. (The first book in the series is titled, A GAME OF THRONES.) Martin's series is peopled with what I consider to be some of the best characters in modern literature. These are multidimensional personalities with genuine emotions. The villains are not evil through and through, and no hero is without blemish. This, along with the fact that Martin is utterly vicious to his characters, leaving the reader with the feeling that no one is safe within these pages, makes these volumes a must read for anyone even remotely interested in the fantasy genre. That said, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is not flawless. Even for the initiated the first two hundred pages can be quite confusing. Martin doesn't give us any reminders as to where any of these characters left off in previous volumes. Many of the most loved characters were not in book four, A FEAST FOR CROWS, and so their plot threads date all the way back to A STORM OF SWORDS, released in 2000. My memory just isn't that good. I would have enjoyed the story much more if there had either been a recap prior to the beginning of the story, or at least some explanatory dialogue to help refresh the reader's mind. Even after completing the book, I'm still not sure what Tyrion's goal was at the onset of the story. All this to say that once I got into the flow of the story I couldn't pull myself away from it. Martin is masterful when it comes to interweaving plot lines, deceptions, betrayals, lost loves, and fantastic action and suspense. Much of the focus for nearly all of the characters falls on Daenerys Targaryen, the would-be queen of the seven kingdoms who is now the \\"Mother of Dragons.\\" Everyone either wants to manipulate, use, or defeat the young woman with a will of fire.And though she is the focal point for so many, she is unaware of the scheming and infighting across the sea to the lands which she may one day rule. Readers beware, there are some significant shocks in the second half of this tome, and they are very well worth the wait. If you've read the previous four volumes, your wait will be well rewarded. If you've never read this series, I encourage you to get started with A GAME OF THRONES. You won't regret it.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|Found this movie very enjoyable. It was entertaining to the end. There were great characters, an original story line, and had what I like to call a \\"Pixar\\" moment.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Initially this book was somewhat confusing due to an overload of charachter introductions.  Once I had sorted out who was who and how the charachters were either related or interconnected it became very intriguing.  Being an Australian I found the concept of the Parish Council a little bemusing.  Once I realised they hold more power and importance than just a \\"church group\\" I began to understand the attraction of gaining  the seat vacated by Barry's death.<br />Although there is not a single likeable character in this book (with the exception of the dead man and perhaps he is only likeable due to the fact that no one likes to speak ill of the dead)I felt compelled to keep reading just to uncover the extent of their depravities.<br />The ending is tragic which is in keeping with general feel of the book.  If the point of this book is to highlight the inequalities in society and the failure by governmennt systems to protect/rehabilitate/integrate disadvantaged individuals then Rowling has achieved her aim.

B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|An entertaining dynamic between two awkwardly sweet characters steer this film into a unique mood.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience.<br /><br />Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) work at the Yankee Pedlar Inn and are determined to find evidence of the paranormal within its walls before it goes out of business in its final days.  They have a refreshingly platonic friendship that isn't blurred by the typical nudity-harbingering sexual tension so common among horror ilk.  These two have a natural and playful chemistry; you instantly know that they care about each other and, in effect, it makes viewers care about them.  Already this is a solid victory for any horror movie.<br /><br />Claire is a somewhat awkward but super-nice young woman with a childish verve who finds listening to others to be exhausting, instantly slouching like a dropped marionette.  Luke is a nice, quirky guy who likes getting to know the hotel guests.  Their dynamic is nothing short of cute and it comes with some funny accidental scares.  The director clearly went out of his way to make Paxton look childishly cute whenever possible.  The characters were so well written that I could seriously watch this movie as a dramedy without any horror elements, just to watch Luke and Claire's interactions.  It's all done very well and they're so likeable.<br /><br />They want to find proof of Madeleine O'Malley's haunting.  During the process Claire starts hearing things and some cheap scares really made me smile.  Claire does an overnight ghost recording and picks up on something spooky.<br /><br />TV star Lee Jones (Kelly McGillis) is in town for a convention.  She is a bit distant, in a superior way, but subtly maternal.  She offers her spiritual knowledge and turns out to be a medium.  Some limited communication with \\"the other side\\" reveals a room in the hotel where something awful happened that Claire must not enter because she \\"cannot save\\" Madeleine.  The tone shifts from light-hearted to serious as the style of the scares follows suit.  Stranger, graver things start happening involving the hotel guests and further investigations by Claire and Luke.<br /><br />The scares seem simple--like they're meant not to be terrifying, but only jumpy--as if this was made so that preteens could have a \\"good\\" horror movie that won't leave them traumatized.  This is still enjoyable to adults, though.  There's no creepy, dreadful vibe whatsoever.  It's more like you look forward to things, like with a good mystery novel, than dread them.  \\"Spooky\\" elements are simply clich&eacute;s executing perfectly; as if this movie was a \\"how to\\" manual for future horror filmmakers.<br /><br />The camerawork was good; simple, but well-placed and effective.  The movie demanded no more than they gave.<br />Let's be clear.  The horror \\"story\\" wasn't very good. While I loved the character-driven premise and it carried the movie effortlessly, the horror story itself never really felt like it moved forward and it certainly met us with no resolution at the end whatsoever.  However, I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience.save\\" Madeleine.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This was fun for me for awhile then got a bit tedious, however it gets five stars because it seems like it can keep the niece and nephew occupied indefinitely.  The content is all very age appropriate, and with some element of reasoning and experimentation needed to successfully complete the puzzles, it doesn't seem as detrimental, maybe even encourages some spatial reasoning, so letting the kids play with this &#34;indefinitely&#34; isn't as irresponsible as it might seem at first.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Rama (Iko Uwais; Merantau) and his SWAT team infiltrate the dangerous, goon-ridden lair of a criminal Demigod, Tama (he's like an Indonesian Javier Bardem).  Tama's building is festooned with dangerous tenants and Tama's bodyguards.  Like Dredd 3D, this movie is basically set up like a 90s videogame.  The SWAT team enters the building and conquers it one \\"level\\" (i.e., floor) at a time until they reach the \\"the last guy.\\"  For whatever reason this building is basically unguarded and without surveillance on the outside, but loaded with danger on the inside which, again, adds to the videogame appeal.<br /><br />Led by SWAT Sgt. Jaka (Joe Taslim; Dead Mine, The Fast and the Furious 6), the first few levels offer no challenge as they essentially just restrain (for future arrest) drug dealers, junkies and petty criminals.  But when somene hits the alarm, all criminal hands on deck are alerted to the police invaders.  We also learn, much to Jaka's surprise, that this mission is off the books and they can't call for back up.<br /><br />Initially, the action focuses on gunfights.  I was less than thrilled with the occasional shaky camera-work during gun fight scenes, but it didn't terribly interrupt my enjoyment and this never happened during the martial arts scenes--and martial arts are basically all we get for the next hour!<br /><br />Brutal, technical, graphic and gory.  There's some good use of slow motion footage, glorious axe-impaling action, close-up gun shots to the face, and more discharged ammunition than the Morpheus rescue scene in The Matrix.  Iko Uwais truly shocks and impresses during his first fight, a wide-shot tonfa-knife fight with about ten opponents and we get to see every single stab, kick and crush as he unleashes a flurry a supremely fast and elaborate, but clearly observed techniques.  VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!  The best part is that if they used any tricks, like wire work or 1.2x film speed, I can't tell.  They also kept the choreography, while utterly brutal, practical.  No jump spin kicks or gratuitous acrobats.  Just a flood of flesh-lacerating strikes including one of the most unique neck breaks I've ever seen!  Iko Uwais doesn't look like much, but he has truly proven himself to be a martial arts movie star!<br /><br />Then there's Mad Dog (Vayan Ruhian; Merantau).  This guy is tiny.  I mean like young boy who doesn't play sports tiny, by American standards.  However, when he and Jaka (who is MUCH larger) fight you find his power shockingly credible.  They both handle complex choreography very well, Mad Dog much better than Jaka, and they produce a fight with techniques executed from realistic positions that I doubt I've ever seen on film before.<br /><br />When Rama gets to the drug prep and processing floor, every single drug handler could have been the master of a martial arts school.  While this would be comically annoying in most American action hero-driven releases, I didn't mind a bit.  Why?  Because it added yet more action to a movie that seems to be non-stop action and the fight quality never majorly dropped with the insignificance of the opponent (i.e., those stunt men cast as drug handlers #1-12).<br /><br />Mad Dog versus Rama and another tough guy...that was a treat.  Mad Dog may be small, but he fights like a rabid Chihuahua on steroids that just won't die!  Despite his tiny size, very clever choreography permits him just the right stance, credible momentum and position to throw or unbalance much larger, stronger opponents.  Rama is also small, but notably larger than Mad Dog.<br /><br />This movie was AMAZING!  IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  If you enjoy seeing truly innovative choreography that actually manages to make sense of small fighters demolishing larger and numerous opponents then you should really turn to movies by Jeeja Yanin (Chocolate, Raging Phoenix) and Tony Jaa (The Protector, Ong-Bak but not Ong-Bak 2 or 3).rutal, practical.

B007REV4T8|4.0|\\"Skyfall\\" isn't a perfect movie, but it is extremely enjoyable on many levels, even for someone who's not a great fan of the James Bond series overall, like me.<br /><br />Some men who've played Bond relied too heavily on looks and charm, creating a jokily amusing but shallow character. There's nothing shallow about Daniel Craig, a gifted actor whose charm lurks below his rough surface, whose humor is drier than Death Valley in mid-summer, and who gives Bond complexity and substance that's been lacking in the franchise since the Sean Connery days. His affectionate sparring with the equally talented Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss at the British spy agency MI-6, and the decision to reveal something of Bond's early life, provide an emotional center that enables the viewer to feel invested in the characters rather than merely watching them romp through one improbable action set piece after another.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the theft from MI-6 of a computerized list of the identities of every NATO agent embedded in a terrorist group. M wants Bond to recover the list before the embedded agents' true identities are revealed and they are all killed. The theft of the list becomes publicly known, leading to a painful parliamentary investigation with M in the dock before a grandstanding MP, trying to justify her leadership at MI-6 and the British taxpayers' continued funding of an \\"old-fashioned\\" intelligence agency like MI-6 in an age of cyber-terrorism.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing staged action sequences that did not look computer generated or as though they'd been filmed in front of a green screen. I was pleased to see such an escapist franchise address questions of failure, legacy, aging, abandonment, and our desire that we and the institutions to which we have devoted our lives remain relevant . . . and include an fairly long quote from a Tennyson poem. This Bond has a past, a present and a future.<br /><br />I don't want to give the impression that the movie isless fun than it is. The action sequences, travelogue photography (Turkey, Shanghai, Macau and Scotland) and  Bond beauties are entirely up to scratch. Javier Bardem is juicily malicious as the villain. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, perhaps best known for his work with Joel and Ethan Coen, captures exquisite images, visual textures and moods as usual--the man is years overdue for an Academy Award. I liked everything about the ending.<br /><br />There were parts of the movie I thought could have moved a little faster, the genius psychotic cyber-villain seems a bit tired as a plot device, and the shifts from introspection to escapism were sometimes a bit jarring; hence four stars instead of five. But overall a very enjoyable outing. This probably won't be a favorite of people who like their Bond all-escapist, but for people who prefer a bit of thought and emotional engagement mixed in with their spectacle, definitely worth the price of a ticket.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love this hilarious, Very R rated movie. I never buy movies, but this one is special. Could not do anything to improve on it. It is a very funny comedy. That is out of the box, but not to far out. It is so good. My boyfriend never likes movies but we both could not wait till this one came out. I pre ordered it right after we saw it. As soon as amazon offered it.

0451232852|5.0|Fall of Giants will meet all of your expectations if you are a fan of Ken Follet. If you haven't read any of his books before but are a fan of historical novels, this is a good place to introduce yourself to his work.<br /><br />Fall of Giants is packed with historical detail and three dimensional characters. Character development is the key element that moves this novel along.<br /><br />If this novel was simply a recital of historical events with characters hung about like ornaments, I couldn't have made it through the 900 plus pages that the paperback edition weighs in at. But Follet incorporates the characters into the historical events and trends, while allowing them and their relationships to evolve in ways that you can believe. Many in ways that might surprise you. Some in ways that will surely move you.

My 8 year olds LOVE it. They sit with it in deep concentration for HOURS!  Every adult that comes by also gets drawn into it.  For those with patience and concentration it is really something else, we have come across nothing like it.<br /><br />This is by far the best present anyone has ever given, and I look forward to making this my standard gift this next year for all birthdays we are invited to.<br /><br />Now that we are hooked onto this, if anyone knows other such puzzles, please post.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|This very strange and crazy story about Lincoln hunting and killing vampires, except for one that he befriends, is clearly not meant to be taken seriously.  Also, you will find the friendly vampire's haircut anachronistic, and the sequence with the horse stampede is not believable or even photographed well.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT THERE WERE PAGES AND PAGES OF NOT SO INTERESTING FACTS. AND TOO MANY CHARACTERS TO KEEP UP WITH.. I AM A FAN OF  GRISHAMS AND WILL BUY MORE OF HIS BOOKS , BUT THIS IS NOT HIS BEST ONE.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|What is it with this director?  The story is very good, but everyone sounds like they're reading from a page and the buildings don't look real.  Kids don't pose like that, people don't walk like that, nothing seems natural at all.  I guess that's fine if you are into Wes Anderson.

B004132HZS|5.0|This is a fantastic take on the Sherlock Holmes franchise;  the stories are extremely faithful to the original characters while putting them in modern situations.  What if Sherlock Holmes had to deal with the internet, cell phones and GPS?  The original stories' Watson/Holmes characters and their \\"bromance\\" is faithfully reproduced in this series, as well but without getting weird.  The acting is spectacularly good and the production values are movie quality.  I convinced my teenaged son, who hasn't read or seen adaptations of the original novels or stories, to watch an episode with me and he was instantly hooked.  He said, \\"Sherlock Holmes is like a combination of Doctor Who and Gregory House.\\"  Which he is!  The amount of sex and swearing is a bit more than Doctor Who, a bit less than House, and far far less than Torchwood, so as a 48-year-old woman I can watch this with my son without embarrassment.  I am buying the first two seasons for all my family members this Christmas;  I know they'll love them.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The game looks very cool, and I have been a fan of the Angry Birds franchise for a while, so of course I immediately bought it, the only problem is that the installation keeps failing.

Just wondering<br /><br />But Criminal Minds shows another award-winning season with this DVD release! Absolutely the best crime drama on TV, hands down! I liked the extras on the DVD, showing how some shows went from concept to creation, and the gag reel!<br /><br />Quoth the Raven

B00979CS50|5.0|This is Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their best. If you loved the lyrics and HEAVY guitar of Ragged Glory, Everyone Knows This is Nowhere, Live Rust, etc., you'll love this. I hope I can still bring it when I'm Neil's Age. His Best CD since Ragged Glory for this style of Neil. How does he do 15-26 minute songs with extensive guitar breaks without boring and sounding repetitious? This is the mark of a genius, which Neil is. If you look at his body of work and variety of styles, He's up there with dylan, and as a guitar player, he can do more with one note or chord than many can do with a hundred: a VASTLY under-appreciated and underrated guitarist.

B007HU7NBK|2.0|I was a Duran Duran super fan growing up and loved John Taylor more then any other band member and was therefore super excited to buy his autobiography.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham has come through again with his latest legal thriller The Racketeer.  While not perfect, this one is entertaining as usual & a real joy to read.  The complicated plot, decent character development, good pacing, and sufficient twists & turns are all pleasing to the reader.  My only critique is that the story is so complex it is not always believable.  Readers who have enjoyed the last few Grisham books should find this one well worth thier time and money.

I just bought the sixth book and I'm looking forward to many many more in this series.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, the things they do are believable and the stories are just plain interesting.  Not many authors are able to accomplish all three of these things.<br /><br />On top of great stories, they are well written.  There are no weird phrasings to trip up the eyes and I don't think I found more than 2 or 3 typos in five books.<br /><br />I'm going to buy a hard copy of this for the bookshelf and later reading.

B0052TDGQO|2.0|I have to agree with the two- and three-star reviewers.  We all like Scotty as a young man and we like his voice.  I watched Idol and was a fan all season.  He seems like a great young man and I hope he hangs on to his values.<br /><br />The problem with the album is the songwriting.  It is clear from listing to it that the producer was in a big hurry to record Scotty and capitalize on the Idol success.  The song writing was incredibly weak.  I also found the instrumentals to be lacking any real imagination.
0316228532|5.0|I saw snippets from two reviewers saying \\"don't pick up this book if you don't like sad books\\" and \\"I read the first 100 pages and won't be finishing it.\\"  There is something true in each of those statements, however it will be a great loss to those who are too influenced by them and thus miss the opportunity to understand and feel what this book will make you understand and feel.  After 100 pages I had remarked to a friend that it was enjoyable to read so far because it was very well-written and sharp-witted, but that I hoped it got less dreary soon.  It didn't necessarily get cheery, but the storylines and characters certainly got compelling, thought-provoking and emotion-provoking.  What I thought of as \\"dreary\\" early on became something else - something I can't name, something which made me think that the world is not always so nice a place, and that it's good to have compassion for others in it.  Neither of these messages are delivered by being pedantic or using cliches, though.  Instead they are conveyed by simply telling the stories and presenting the characters as-is, almost as if it's a documentary or bit of journalism, and letting the stories and characters' actions lead you to your own reactions and conclusion. In the end, there is a lot to learn by letting yourself be put into the minds of the characters, especially the teens, as incredibly well as JK Rowling does.<br /><br />I'm very happy to see Rowling be able to move on beyond Harry Potter now.  As outstanding and influential as the HP series was, this book shows clearly that Rowling has much more to offer the world through her writing.  At the same time, I also now see that part of the brilliance of Harry Potter was Rowling's ability to be inside the minds of adolescents and teens (no easy feat; I'm the dad of three teens, I know), and that's something she has carried with her to this new novel.  The setting of that insight in this book is almost anti-magical, anti-fantasy though - which makes it avery different kind of book, and one I think is very well worth reading.

They start experiencing weird things after someone moved into a house across the street. This is not a bad idea for a sequel, and there are certainly a few scares, but all in all the fourth entry of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is more silly than scary.<br /><br />As you know, everything is shot in a \\"found footage\\" style, trademark of this franchise. In \\"Paranormal Activity 4,\\" a high school girl Alex Nelson (Kathryn Newton) and her friend Ben (Matt Shively) record strange occurrences in the house, using laptop computers. They also frequently chat via webcam. The latest entry's story is set in 2011.<br /><br />They may employ new video recording devices, but it seems the filmmakers have used up ideas to scare the viewers. I think most of us are now accustomed to sudden loud noises and things popping out. It is the easiest way to scare people, and it works, well, maybe for the first twenty minutes. Then it gets repetitious and predictable, especially when the film has virtually no story to tell.<br /><br />Strangely, neither Alex nor Ben is really interested in checking the recorded images that would show (and do show to us) what is going on in the house. OK, maybe files did not open (so conveniently), but even so, there are still so many creepy events that happen to the unsuspecting characters. If \\"that thing\\" should fall from above right in front of me in my house, I would immediately run away and move out.<br /><br />But they don't. OK, I know, this is a film, not reality. Sadly, the film's visual and narrative styles that once claimed to be real have become tiresome and contrived. With the franchise's initial novelty wearing out, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" has run its course.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game....I can play it with my 4yrs old niece cuz she love planting the flowers...very fun. And love the graphics ...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First of all,this is not the type of book i normally read.  But I was curious.  Surprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is so nice to know what really happened.  And i really don't feel like any government secrets were jeoparidzed or any security breached.  My sincere thanks to all vets who protect our country every day but a special thanks to this seal for his service and sacrifices and for setting the record straight!  Very well written!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I found the book to be well written,  original and creative.  A story about the first human being to use counting and the results of his introduction of time keeping on Earth. An entertaining and thought provoking read.  I rate it with 5 stars.
1423124111|5.0|Amazon currently has this book \\"under review\\" and are only sending folks on to other sellers who offer it at a substantially higher price than I paid Amazon for it less than 2 weeks ago. I can not imagine why. The copy I ordered at a great price from Amazon came only 10 days after ordering it, and that's due in part to a weekend being in the way.<br /><br />The book is MAGNIFICENT! I have always had a special place in my heart for the Disneyland Attraction posters, and a meticulously silk-screened print of my favorite (The original 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA exhibit that was in Tomorrowland from 1955 to 1966) hangs in my living room. This book shares hundreds of them from ALL the Disney parks, reproduced in a glorious art book manner. Look, it's only 144 pages yet weighs over 3 pounds from the heaviness of the glossy paper and the fancy art-house printing of it. Classy and high-quality! This is a wonderful, wonderful book.
1423124111|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I must admit that when I first got it, I felt that it was a little too big. After opening it, I was really impressed with the size and quality of the pictures.  I loved reading about the background of the posters. Anything Disney is a love of mine! Would definitely recommend this to others.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|\\"The Avengers\\", directed by Joss Whedon, is based off of the Marvel comics. Characters that many know and love, such as Iron Man, Captain America, and The Hulk, are brought to life before our very eyes. Yes, there have been movies about all three of these magnificent characters, but they have never before come together in a way quite like this. Watching \\"The Avengers\\", I found the details rather hard to follow, simply because I have never been a big comic book fan. Sure, I have seen my share of super hero movies, but I never opened myself up to the breathtaking skill of the Marvel comics.<br /> Like any movie based off of one thing or another, one must be familiar with the background. I, however, was not. Many people who have seen \\"The Avengers\\" have at least seen one - if not more - of the heroes in previous action. For me, it was all new. I enjoyed the movie very much so, but I couldn't help wondering if I could have had a better take on it having seen the other movies prior to watching \\"The Avengers\\". For example, Loki tries turning Stark into one of his minions by targeting his heart. The thing is, Stark doesn't have a heart, which is shown in \\"Iron Man\\". How, then, is one like myself to know that when they have not seen the movie? Sure, is expected that one watching \\"The Avengers\\" has seen all the previous Marvel comic men in action, but that is not always the case. I feel they should have been more descriptive in this, even if it simply included a small back flash, as they include for Captain America.<br /> As the movie progresses, \\"The Avengers\\" are gathered together to stop Loki and his force of evil from taking the freedom of humans. \\"Freedom is a lie,\\" as Loki told the people of Germany as he had them all kneel before him. Upon the death of their mutual friend, both Captain America and Stark begin to full accept the fact that they do need to work together in order to complete the task that is at hand. In the end, they band together to destroy the evil thatis leaking into the city of Manhattan through a portal, which, inevitably, leads to space.<br /> Stark has a revelation in the last ten minutes of the movie, realizing that he will be the one to save the city. While one of his teammates can close the portal, Stark must take the missile rushing towards the city and send it through the portal before it is closed. By doing this, he is risking his life. It is as if Stark's revelation changed him, for the better, in the end. Isn't that how most movies end? All together, \\"The Avengers\\" was a brilliantly created movie, leaving all who watch it to bask in the glory of a job well done. I would, ultimately, recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of their history with comic books.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Of Monsters And Men is a great new band, and My Head is an Animal is an amazing album, so for that reason i highly recommend buying this.<br />The vinyl itself is actually really good, probably the best new vinyl I've bought. It is perfect for either listening to or playing. One thing I wanted to see when I was buying was more description of the vinyl, so here it is. It comes as a gate fold, double pink vinyl, with 3 songs on each side. The gate fold fold is the same as the paper CD case for this album. It is overall a great purchase.

B008458O3S|3.0|Game play:<br />The game advises you that it uses Amazon Circle; it tells you that you can turn it on if you want to.<br /><br />You are connecting like colors of train stations and goal stations. You draw a connecting track with your finger. There is no limit to the track you can draw and no score. When the track is complete the train will run and make the trip. You can adjust the speed of the trains with a slider switch to adjust their velocity.<br /><br />If you draw a track that is impossible to travel or has a gap the train crashes and disappears. As you complete a city a new city section is available to you and you start having obstacles in the way like boulders. If you accidently skip a piece of track you can just draw it into place and it works fine.<br /><br />Every tile can only hold two pieces of track but if you redraw the same path twice it will become a single piece of track. You can also use erase and undo to remove your tracks or even shake the smart device and the track will disappear. The game will allow you to move multiple trains to a station or even split the tracks from one source to multiple stations. You can cross the tracks, just don't time the train motion so they crash.<br /><br />Main page:<br />* Start the game shows you a list of cities you have to play in and only Abbotsford is open and listed.<br />* More games - opens a massive list of games from many developers as well as the Amazon Appstore and the Amazon Browser links to purchase each one.<br />* Options - Switch players, set volume, set color blind version, turn off visual FX, unlock all puzzles, and erase player data. You have to complete the game to unlock the expert mode.<br />* Credits not only lists the credits but links you to the Amazon Appstore and Amazon browser.<br /><br />What I like:<br />This is an intriguing strategy and puzzle game that is fun to play. The controls work well and game play is fun and easy. The graphics are adequate and the sound effects are OK. The game gets more challenging as the game progresses.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The game is OK but there is no score or timing. You can make the track as long or as short as you want. The challenge comes to get the right color trains into the right color train terminals. I wish there was a scoring system or a bonus to lay the track as short as possible to earn a bonus.<br /><br />The game contains multiple links to the web to Amazon so turn off your WIFI or put your phone into airplane mode. The links to Amazon allow purchases of games and merchandise if you are set up in that mode of shopping. Keep your children off the web unsupervised and stop unwanted purchases.<br /><br />After turning the game on multiple times it asks you to like the game on Facebook. This creates a link to you so that they can send you messages on new games. (Also so your friends can see the messages on your board.) The game then starts asking you to try out new games like Pixel Twist and it gives you two buttons to touch to get it or not get it. Your children have a 50/50 chance of getting it for you. Even though the game is free you have not had the opportunity to test it and check the permissions. Such doorways to download items should not be available in a game.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a fun and challenging game to play. I like how the game gets gradually more difficult instead of immediately becoming almost impossible like some games. I also like how there are small tutorials along the way to help you learn new items when they are needed. There are a lot of puzzles, 100 main puzzles and 50 bonus puzzles.<br /><br />The app is worth the $.99 they are asking for it. The only thing I don't like is the multiple links to the web and to Amazon. This is a nice children's game and the links forces you to turn off the WIFI or go into airplane mode for safety reasons. I also don't like all of the links to the web and the pop up Facebook request. The pop up request to try a game iscompletely unnecessary. I don't like how developers put this type of action into the later phases of a game so first time reviewers will not see it by playing only a few levels and provide a higher rating. Later on your children can find it and use it. This is a good example of why it is necessary to play the game and test all aspects of it so you can find all the surprises. Definitely turn off your WIFI.<br /><br />I rate this game as a 3 star game. It is a good puzzle game and fun to play and as a game it is between a 4 and 5 star rating. If it had a point gathering system to make you be more efficient in laying the track and a little more action it could be rated higher. The multiple links to the web and asking to try games dropped the score.<br /><br />Size: The compressed size is 12.1 MB and 23.75 MB when uncompressed.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents<br />* Network communication - full internet access<br />* Network communication - view network statecompletely unnecessary.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|This is my kind of humor.  Not high-brow, but not slap-stick either.  It's an ingenious blend of irony, subtlety, and gore parody.  Kudos to the writers and director.  Watch it....you'll laugh, trust me.

B008KGPEQG|3.0|This is a memoir presented in the way we often remember things - fragments out of sequence, some specific and very detailed events that we regard as significant, lists of things, memories of people and ghosts of others. He is writing in a cold harsh winter in New York, and as he says at 64, in the winter of his life. The recollections are written in the second person, an unusual style in literature, but I'm surprised that more memoirs are not written this way, for in the storytelling in our heads we often talk to ourselves that way: `now where on earth did you put that?'; `you should go over and say hello'; or my regular, `you idiot'.<br /><br />If there is a theme in this book, it is the way we experience the world through our bodies, though ironically through bodies that we can never fully see in the way that other people can. We feel like an integrated physical being, but we can only ever look at bits of ourselves, even in the mirror or a photograph. Three dimensional holograms will be extraordinary for more than just the technology.<br /><br />Auster recalls the physicality of childhood, the hugs and body contact, the bumps and bruises, scars whose causes are both vividly remembered and long forgotten. There are the teenage years of raging hormones and sexual discovery, and early manhood where trying to make sense of relationships often ends in failure and the occasional unwanted infection. There is a confident middle age, but now he feels he is getting old and his body is no longer capable of doing everything it once could, and it is showing signs of wear and tear. He has acquired habits that are not good for his health but he is now too old to change his ways - the vice is just too nice.<br /><br />Food is one of the corporal pleasures and he remembers childhood meals and treats, listing all his favourite things, many now abandoned unless tempted in the boredom of an airport lounge. If you want to know why Americans are the unhealthiest people in the rich world, there are plenty of clues here. In contrast, Christmas dinners with his wife's family are a simple affair and the menu has never varied over the years. The meals tie the family closer even as the years change the characters and separate them geographically.<br /><br />He is a lover, not a fighter. He has been fascinated by girls from boyhood and is lonely and adrift without women in his life. Sleeping alone he feels bereft and one of the great pleasures of his life, both emotional and physical, has been the constant companionship of his current wife, to whom he has been married for over thirty years. It was love at first meeting and they share much in common. He muses that she is a better version of himself. Throughout his life it has never been the physical attraction of women that arouses him, though he says his wife is beautiful (always wise to insure yourself in print). Rather, it is the `inner spark' of a woman that beguiles him, something about her character and intellect, the very thing that he sensed when he and his future wife met after a literary seminar, or that surprised him when Sandra, a Parisian prostitute, recited long passages of Baudelaire.<br /><br />One of his favourite ways to engage his body with the world is walking. He walks regularly in his native New York and in cities around the world as he travels. He is out in all sorts of weather, his body exposed to extremes of temperature, to the wind and sun, icy air and brewing storms. He says that walking is integral to his ability to write, an observation that many writers have made, but in the end he has very little to say about this linkage.<br /><br />At a few points in the book he pauses to tell us that he is writing, as winter howls or closes in silently outside. Going over the events of his life he is always scribbling in the background, increasingly making it a daily routine, and after marriage it is in parallel to his wife's literary work. But how do the often mundane events of his lifelead to this feverish obsession with getting words down on paper? There is no clue whatsoever. We get the dull and diurnal, but no idea how they transubstantiate into the occasionally sublime.<br /><br />At one period in his life he is feeling very low and his ability to write seems to have deserted him. He goes to watch a rehearsal by a group of eight dancers. They rehearse without music and each of their pieces is interspersed with the choreographer explaining what she is trying to do. The explanations confuse and bore him, but each time the dancers move he is spellbound. There is something about their movements that inspires him, gives him a sense of freedom and possibility. It is a turning point in his life, after which he is able to return to productive writing. But what was it about those dancers and their movements that lit the spark? As happens too often in this memoir, words fail him. He describes the incident in a matter-of-fact way, says it changed his life, then slips into the next memory. The reader is left bewildered in the wings.<br /><br />There are deaths, of family and friends, increasing in number as he gets older. He confesses that he cries more often at films and novels than he does at the deaths of other people. Age makes him more conscious of his own mortality, but he senses that it also makes him more accepting. For many years he suffered panic attacks, fearsome and terrifying, so unlike the calm he sees in those sliding into death. Perhaps death is most feared when we realise that we have not really lived.<br /><br />Paul Auster writes well, but for me too much of this latest memoir reads like short entries in a diary, dot points for some future exposition. His life is often dreary - that is true for all of us - but he very rarely explores why some memories remain important to him. It's an odd shortcoming in a writer. When he attempts an explanation, his interpretive skills are insufficient and we can only wonder what he was trying to convey. His account of why he gave up driving is the only point in the book where I felt he was revealing a truth about his character, but otherwise self-reflection is in short supply. Perhaps a future biographer will turn this material into something far more telling.

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a novel in three parts. In the first, the narrator Dell Parsons recalls the events leading up to the imprisonment of his parents when he was fifteen and living in Great Falls, Montana. In the second, he depicts his young life in Canada, working for a man with a violent past in a remote town in Saskatchewan. In the final part, Dell is sixty-six years old, still in Canada, and on the verge of retirement from teaching. He recalls his last meeting with his twin sister Berner and tries to draw out some meaning from the events recounted in the first two parts of the story.<br /><br />Dell's father, Bev Parsons, is retired from the air force after having been caught in an illegal smuggling racket. Bev tries his hand at selling cars, then real estate, but in an attempt to make better money he revives his smuggling operation, this time linking a group of Cree Indians with a buyer on the Great Western Railway. Dell's mother, Neeva, is a teacher whose Polish immigrant parents disowned her after she got pregnant and married Bev. She regrets the marriage and longs for a more cultured existence than the one she experiences in Great Falls. Dell's twin sister is also keen to get away and links up with a tearaway boy named Rudy, hoping he will be her passport to freedom. Dell himself is focused on his interests of chess and beekeeping, and looking forward to senior high school.<br /><br />Bev's smuggling operation goes awry so he decides to rob a bank in order to get the money that he owes to the Indians. Neeva, against her better judgement, decides to go along with him. The pair are no Bonnie and Clyde, and a local newspaper describes the ensuing heist as a comedy of errors. Bev and Neeva end up behind bars, Berner heads off into the night and Dell is left alone and bewildered. The family is no more.<br /><br />Mildred, a friend of Dell's mother, collects Dell and drives him over the border into Canada so that he can stay with Mildred's brother Arthur and begin a new life.In fact Dell spends most time with an odd and menacing character named Charley. Dell works as a cleaner in the hotel owned by Arthur and very slowly is taken into Arthur's orbit. Dell later learns hunting and butchering with Charley, and is also befriended by Florence, a local artist and Arthur's girlfriend. Arthur has a dark past and ran away from a career at Harvard to escape the police. He settled in Fort Royal in Canada, but after Dell has been living here for a while, two men from Arthur's past come from Chicago to seek him out. Arthur ends up murdering the two men and runs off. It is Florence who then rescues Dell and sends him to her brother in Winnipeg where Dell finally returns to school and builds his future life.<br /><br />Dell never saw his parents again after the day they went to jail, and his mother committed suicide there. Dell later married, though he and his wife had no children, and generally he has led a happy life in Canada. In the end he visits his dying sister back in the United States. She has been a heavy drinker and has a cancer that is rapidly killing her, though after a series of failed relationships she is finally living with a man who is good to her.<br /><br />Despite the bleakness of his youth, and the tumultuous events that saw him uprooted and set adrift in Canada, Dell has remained forward looking and determined. His view of life - though he does not articulate it in this way - is a mixture of the Buddhist ideal of living focused in the present and the existentialist idea that life has no intrinsic meaning and that it is our role as individuals to give it significance. To survive and be content, Dell says, you need to tolerate loss, avoid cynicism and keep a sense of proportion in your life. Sometimes it can be hard to see the good, but it is always there if we are willing to look with unclouded eyes.<br /><br />Dell experiences some harrowing things for a young teenage boy, but he never surrenders to despair. When the bigger picture is grim, he focuses on the detail of the world around him and maintains a curiosity about life and the way nature works. It might be wrong to call his approach optimism, but in the end that is what it looks like.<br /><br />Richard Ford's prose is clear and finely etched. Both Great Falls and Fort Royal, small towns with little going on, come alive in Dell's story. The wide open spaces of these lands contrast with the densely cluttered thoughts and fears that run through Dell's mind. Dell is saved by the kindness of strangers - Mildred, then Florence - but his ability to make an ultimately happy life for himself is down to his capacity to build on the cards he is dealt. His sister Berner doesn't fare so well, in many ways embodying the weaknesses of her mother, though she is cheerful as death looms.<br /><br />This is a long and detailed novel. The key events - the bank robbery and the murders - are spelled out by Dell in the opening pages, so there are no big surprises on that score. Instead, the novel is a study of how a young boy comes of age under dire conditions, and how good can win out over evil and tragedy if we approach life in a particular way.<br /><br />Dell is reconstructing events from a long time ago, both explaining how they seemed to him at the time and how he understands them in retrospect as a mature man. It's a difficult technique but Richard Ford manages it very well and the voice throughout is authentic and convincing. Ford captures the period (the early 1960s) well and the behaviour of the female characters in particular evinces the division between the older generation still adhering to pre-war values and the sixties generation seeking a new way to be. Oddly, Dell fits into neither side of this divide, instead charting a course through life that is at once idiosyncratic and instructive.

6304884419|5.0|I'm amazed that 19 years (and numerous viewings) after this movie came to life, I find myself writing a review. Perhaps it's because this film serves as a time machine to my childhood. I can't begin to tell you folks just how accurately this film portrayed the 1960's in NYC neighborhoods. From the clothes, cars, music, - all too obvious - to the \\"not so obvious\\" dangerous bus hitchhikes, stick ball and \\"Johnny-on-the Pony\\" games we used to play day in and day out. This movie is an absolute gem. I knew people like this growing up in Brooklyn. I went to school with many \\"wannabee Sonnys\\", some of who are not around today. The message behind this story is ageless and I'm grateful to Misters Palminteri and DeNiro for bringing it to the screen.

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|First, I'm NOT going to compare this to BOB.  This series should stand on its own and, quite honestly, it comes up short.  Far short.<br /><br />For me, the biggest issue is that the main characters weren't well defined early on.  It wasn't clear which were the \\"main three\\" until quite late in the series.  I found it difficult to tell them apart -- it would have helped if each had been given some distinguishing feature.  When there was a battle scene and someone died, I found myself wondering who it was until we finally got to a daylight scene and I could (usually) figure out who was missing.<br /><br />Which brings me to the large number of night scenes and the chaos that ensued in most of the battle scenes.  There's no doubt that war is chaotic.  However, the challenge for screenwriters and directors is to focus that chaos -- to keep the viewer's attention focused on a character or an issue or something so that we have a thread to follow through the fog and chaos.  Instead, there was a constant theme of lots of people running around, lots of people being blown to bits and little sense of what was happening to whom.  I found myself admiring the special effects rather than actually getting \\"into\\" the battles -- and when you start thinking about SFX in a movie, the director has lost you.<br /><br />I agree that there is an anti-American bias that doesn't do our vets justice.  No one is suggesting that the American GIs were perfect.  But, other than the one scene in which the Japanese use civilians as human shields, we aren't privy to the atrocities committed by the Japanese, only those ostensibly committed by Americans.  We are repeatedly told the Americans must \\"kill the Japs\\" but not told that it was dishonorable for Japanese to surrender and, on many islands, nearly every Japanese soldier would fight to the death rather than be captured (taking as many Marines with him as possible).<br /><br />Finally, the movie suggests that most Marines came back scarred for life by their experiences. My father was a WWII Marine.  He, like the overwhelming majority of WWII vets, returned to a grateful nation, settled down, went to college on the GI BIll (many of them), got jobs, married (or not), had kids (or not), and went on to live productive lives.<br /><br />The Marines who sacrificed so very much in the Pacific, including the far too many who never made it home, deserve better than this effort.  If The Pacific was meant to \\"honor\\" them someone needs to teach Hanks/Spielberg the meaning of honor.
B000024JEX|4.0|I really love the playing of the trio and the song selections.  I very much like the way Jarrett  phrases the basic tune to each of these mostly standard selections.  I have one very critical point.  Jarrett's constant noise making while he plays is very irritating.  I have 1000's of jazz records and generally prefer live performances to studio recordings of any style of music including classical and rock in addition to jazz.  I have no problem with incidental noise and the occasional grunt or howl, but Jarrett's frequent whining to the music is just too much.  Since he plays to a live audience, and is a professional musician (of astounding talent and ability), he should have more empathy with his audience.  It may sound arrogant, but I think that he ought to be more disciplined for the benefit of his audience.  It is not unusual for jazz musicians to make noise when they are really in the groove, but Jarrett's noise making is loud, whiny, and constant.<br /><br />With being on the  go and living with a family, I frequently use earphones/headphones which emphasizes the ridiculous noise that Jarrett makes.  By comparison, Glenn Gould hums and sings, Bud Powell hums and grunts etc, but no one brings it the to level of Jarrett.  I wish he would get this under control.  Maybe if you were there, you might not notice it or remember it, but when it is on the recording, you hear it every time you play it.<br /><br />Despite all of this complaining, I listen to Jarrett's trio playing standards with some frequency.  he really is one of the greatest jazz piano players of our time.  He has technique to spare and a level of taste that is beyond compare.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I purchased this product to protect against drops, due to the testing up to 2 meters.  The first time I dropped my phone, from a distance of about 5 feet onto my living room laminate wood floor, the screen of my iphone went dark.  Case came partially unsnapped, but did not break. Had hoped for better protection for the price I paid for this and I have had it less than a month.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|I love the fact that one can download albums from amazon and then just drag them into iTunes.  I didn't know this until my sister told me and this is the second album that I have done this with.  I like the songs and as a Bon Jovi fan, you just can't go wrong with this album.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This was well worth the nominal charge.  It's accurate, and tells you in terms of activity how much power you have left.  And i really like that you can have it give an audio warning at specified points, ex &quot;You are at 60%&quot;.  It's a very helpful app.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|We bought this book as research material for my daughters Science report.  We found it informative and engaging.

Read this and be educated.
B0068FYZIO|4.0|Schindler's List starts at the time in history immediately after German y defeats Poland.  The Jews in the country are forced to register with the government and abandon their homes.  They are moved to designated communities called ghettos and are no longer allowed to own businesses.  Mr. Schindler, a business man, proposes a contract with some wealthy Jews.  They give him their money, since they cannot use it anymore, and Mr. Schindler purchases a factory.  He employs many of the Jews at his factory so that they may earn the basic living essentials, as they have no use for money in the ghettos.  When the ghettos are invaded and the Jews transported to a work camp, Mr. Schindler makes a deal with the director of the camp to take his workers back to the factory in exchange for some of the profits.  The workers are thrilled to get out of the harsh conditions of the work camp where anyone can be shot and killed at any time for any or no reason.  Once word gets out about Schindler's factory, he acquires many more workers that would have likely been killed at the camp.<br /><br />Eventually the government shuts down the work camp and all of the Jews are going to be sent to the concentration camp Auschwitz.  Mr. Schindler devises a plan to open an ammunition factory and employ all of the Jews from the work camp and his previous factory.  He makes a list of all of the Jews he wants to employ at his factory.  When the trains come to transport them to the factory in Czech Slovakia, the train with the women is accidentally sent to Auschwitz.  Mr. Schindler bribes the director at the concentration camp with gold if he will relinquish his workers.  They are transported to the factory and seven months later the war is over and they are free.  Mr. Schindler was a good man who saved eleven hundred Jews from uncertain death at concentration camps.<br /><br />This movie directly relates to world religions because it was one of the most integral times in, not only Jewish history, butalso world history.  It exemplifies the degree of oppression the Jews faced under Hitler's rule.  Over six million Jews were killed in the holocaust directly because of their heritage and religious beliefs.  Schindler's List was a great example of the horrible treatment and murder of Jews during the holocaust and was able to give me a realistic depiction of what life was like during that time.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although the neurosurgeon author provides excellent scientific evidence of an afterlife, the description was nearly incomprehensible.  The extraordinary personal experience does not translate well into an understandable description.  For something that was more real than life, it had many of the qualities of a dream.  Perhaps that is what makes it so believable and possibly, true.  What person alive could describe the wonders of complete love and acceptance without limits?

B008458O3S|4.0|this game loaded and played fine on my kindle. I like games that make you think and are a bit of a challenge - but aren't ridiculously hard to do and this fits the bill. perfect to kill a few minutes and always a thrill when you figure out a puzzle that had stumped you.(
B008B8A9V8|4.0|If you,, like so many of us knitters are only using 1 cast on and 1 bind off for all your knitting, then this book will expand your repertoire . While the pictures are good, they are static and I'm afraid we are all getting  spoiled by You-tube. I bought the ebook, I can call it up on my laptop and use it while knitting. I am trying different COs and BOs on swatches as suggested by the book, so I think it was a worthwhile purchase. One thing I am unhappy about is the the book states that the book jacket has a quick reference list of all the COs and BOs with their advantages...but that is not part of the ebook.

0307592731|5.0|If you are easily offended and feel the need to judge people for their past actions, then you might not like this book. You might be shocked by her wild sex life, drug use, and adulteries committed before she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. Best pass it by if you are this kind of person. Godspeed.<br /><br />But, if you admire guts and unsparing honesty, if you want to read the well-written, wrenching tale of redemption of a woman pushing her body and mind to the limit, then you must explore Ms. Strayed's book. I checked it out of my library, and loved it so much I am buying my own copy (despite the fact that I usually avoid Oprah recommendations like the plague). Simply said, this book speaks to me, and I deeply admire Ms. Strayed for her courage. So few would have the guts to do what she did and write so baldly of her life's mistakes and devastating losses.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. You might love it, you might hate it. But it is worth the read.

B00979CS50|5.0|I admire Neil Young like I do very few other artists. I admire above all, maybe, his willingness to do whatever it is he wants to do, when he wants to do it, critics, fans, anyone else be damned. As a result, sometimes I have been damned. Certainly, he has released a number of records I have little personal attachment to. I haven't lost any sleep over that; I doubt he has either. I can pick and choose from among them, there a lot to choose from. I can say, however, without the slightest hesitation that anything with Crazy Horse is something I want. And most of those I love. I love this one. For my money, Psychedelic Pill is Neil's best since [[ASIN:B000002LMK Ragged Glory]]. And since that is one of my 3 or 4 favorites, I mean this to say a lot.<br /><br />I generally don't bother reviewing things that have more than 30 or so reviews already posted. By that time, pretty much anything I might want to say about a book, record, movie will certainly have been covered and I don't usually feel any burning desire to read through them all to check. In this case I make an exception, if only because I want to share how much I love this. Unless you are very young (lower case y) and / or a complete novice with NY&CH, then you know already how you feel about them and if you haven't purchased this already, then a) they aren't your cup of Neil, b) you are hoping someone gives it to you as a present, c) you're broke, or d) you're on the fence for some odd reason. Get off that fence - this is great, wonderful, loud, fuzzy, committed, ambling, adled, magnificent Neil:<br /><br />20 minute songs! (Heck, for that matter, it could almost be almost 1 two-disc song! Except for a couple of them...)<br /><br />Magisterial 1, 2 and 3 note solos! (And you and I both know that Neil can pull more emotion out of one note than 99% of flashy guitar players can pull out of their entire careers - combined)<br /><br />Meandering lyrics! (While Neil has written his share of terrific lyrics, you and Iboth know that while you might well listen to NY&CH for the singing, you're not really here for the lyrics...)<br /><br />Massive fuzz, barely controlled (and not always) by the Horse! (Is it live or is it memorex? What's the difference with Crazy Horse?)<br /><br />Crazy Horse pure and simple allow Neil (force Neil?) to soar, scream and connect with the internal organs in a way he rarely is able to without them. They are magnificent and with them, Neil Young is great. Like they are here.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm not ready to say that the Crossfire series is better than 50 Shades, but I will say that it is equally as good.  I was counting the days until the second book was released, and I was not disappointed.  The only problem I now have is that book 3 won't be available until next year.

However when i try to load an image or any file or anything, all i get is a blank screen, that says browsing... Its to much of a hassle, and i am tired of messing with it. im not happy, and do not recommend this app to anyone.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|So it's free and it wont go on my kindle!? Why is this!? Please let it be for my Kindle. I dont want to buy it when it a lot of people are getting it free! Sometimes I wish the kindle will let me download the google play store app...Then maybe it would let me have it for the kindle...for free!

143350393X|4.0|Excellent bible and I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the words of Christ are not in red.  Each page is very very light paper so be careful opening pages as it is easy to tear. The content is otherwise amazing and it is nice to read and have detailed explanations of words and context on the same page that you are reading. The ESV is the closest you will get to an English translation that matches the original language but still simple enough for the modern English language and even for those new to the bible.  You also get free online access to ESV dot com where you have access to free maps, illustrations and notes to use for bible study, presentations and preaching.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|\\"Prometheus\\" starts out being quite interesting and absorbing with the visual effects. Unfortunately as others have already stated, the story degenerates into a replication of the original \\"Alien\\" movie with Sigourney Weaver. If you like Science Fiction movies for their special effects, you won't be disappointed. Even so, I was let down by the repetition of the classic \\"Alien\\" plot.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Very happy with the box set. Have never had all the Blue Oyster Cult albums before (I lost interest after Fire Of Unknown Orgin, which I did like.<br />Box set is pretty flimsy though, and the booklet could have been much better. Sound quality on all the albums is good to excellent. Overall, well worth<br />the price to get all their Columbia albums at once.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|A romance story but much more.  A man's story of military rules, violence  and shred thinking.  The villain was always changing.

0142000655|5.0|Recently I reintroduced myself to the work John Steinbeck.  From my school years I am familiar with his \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" and \\"The Pearl,\\" but that just scratches the surface of the 27 novels written by this Pulitzer Prize winner.  I've set myself a goal to read my way through his creativity, and this book so far is my favorite of his.  In fact, it might be one of the best books I have ever read.  It is a book that is magnificent in scope, beginning with a strong reference to Cain and Abel from \\"The Bible,\\" to covering the United States from east to west, mostly focusing on the Salinas Valley in California.  It's basically the story of two families: the Trasks and the Hamiltons (Steinbeck's ancestors; he even appears as a minor character); and the two opposites: good and evil.  From whorehouses to family farms, Steinbeck has covered a lot of ground in these 600 plus pages as he writes with deep feeling, strength, and brutality.  One short section on how to start and drive a pre-World War I automobile is magnificence in a nutshell.  Steinbeck believed that this was his greatest work, and with ample justification.

B006Z21ZJC|5.0|If you're new to Maiden this may not be for you, there are some classics missing.  But if you're already a fan this is a must have.  The mix of songs is great and the quality is top notch.  I wasn't bothered by the quick cuts and screen boxes others have mentioned.  YMMV<br /><br />My only complaint is that Dave Murray's guitar wasn't very loud at all.  I'm not sure if it was an oversight during the mix or a problem with my stereo system but it's definitely annoying.<br /><br />A must own for Maiden fans.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I think the best movies are movies that take a standard formulaic story or plot and are able to do something original with it. It seems, for example, like there are a lot of movies being made these days about heartbreak told from the male perspective, where the supposedly \\"standard\\" gender roles are reversed. It is the male character who is a hopeless romantic, who believes in true love, and is looking for his soul mate, while the female character just wants to keep things simple, and is afraid of anything smacking of too much commitment (no labels). This movie takes that somewhat standard material and does something fairly original, or at least interesting, with it.<br /><br />The movie is, I guess, technically a romantic comedy, but it is not your standard romantic comedy. Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with romantic comedies. I admit there are times when I have a fever that only a romantic comedy can cure, but before you judge me too harshly, you should know I can also bench press like 70 pounds...so...you know, there's that. I guess the point I am trying to make is that this movie will, I think, appeal even to those who do not ordinarily enjoy romantic comedies. It was quite funny in places, and the \\"love story\\" (I know it was not supposed to be a \\"love story\\") avoids most of the sentimentality that can be slightly nauseating in standard romantic comedies.<br /><br />I enjoyed that the story was told in a non-linear way. I am not sure why exactly, but I think it made the movie much more interesting. I think one reason might be because we are all so trained by now in what to expect from a movie like this that we can see what is coming a mile away. If this movie were told in a linear way there are really only two ways it could end. SPOILER ALERT: I give away the ending here. Either the guy winds up getting the girl in the end, or, she leaves him, and he is depressed for awhile, and then decides to finally follow through with that plan he has been holding off on for so long (in this case, to become an architect), and then, after he has got his life together, he meets someone else. This movie chose the latter option obviously, but the point is, if you start this story at the beginning there are really no surprises for the viewer since they already know it can only end one of two ways. By telling the story in a non-linear way you can have lots of surprises: How did they meet? What went wrong?, etc.. I know, reading my description, you are probably thinking: \\"Wow! Two whole surprises!\\" The fact is, there were more than two surprises, but I am suffering from a failure of imagination at the moment. Normally my brain is an endless stream of brilliant insights, but it seems to have momentarily dried up. I apologize.<br /><br />This review is going off the rails fast. Time to be serious. The acting in the movie was excellent. I really like Zooey Deschanel and she was perfect for this role. I also like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and I cannot resist putting in a plug here for one of his movies that I think is one of the best movies ever made. If you have not seen [[ASIN:B000FVQM2Y Brick]] do yourself a favor and watch it. It is brilliant. Back to (500) Days of Summer. The movie is quite funny. I found myself laughing throughout.<br /><br />The movie also raises some interesting questions. For example, how, in the age of greeting cards, pop psychology, and romantic comedies, do we distinguish between our \\"real\\" feelings, and the way we think we are supposed to feel? How do we know that our feelings are genuine? I actually think this is a real problem in our culture. It was a good stroke having the main character work for a greeting card company since greeting cards tend to be associated with sentimentality and false emotion. Another interesting question raised by the movie, What is love? That might seem like too big of a question for a movie to deal with, and it is. One should not expect deep answers to the question from this movie. I also think that to really explore that question honestly the movie would have had to go much darker than I think it wanted to. I think that what most people call love is probably a mix of many things, and some of them are not necessarily positive (obsession, jealousy, possessiveness, etc.). Nevertheless, the movie raises the question in a way that I think most romantic comedies do not, even if it winds up giving a somewhat stock answer (\\"you know it when you feel it\\").<br /><br />The one complaint I had with the movie is with the ending. SPOILER ALERT AGAIN (that's two spoiler alerts for those keeping count). The movie was so original in some ways, I was a little disappointed that the ending seemed fairly pedestrian. The main character has his heart broken, we see him in his depression, going to the store in his bathrobe, then we see the standard montage where he starts working on his architecture again, applying for jobs, and getting his life back on track. This is the standard formula. Heart break is the catalyst that finally forces people to pursue their dreams. We have all seen that story a million times. I realize that this is often what really happens in real life. It has happened to me twice. I had my heart broken and then finally decided to do something I had been wanting to do for years but was too lazy, too caught up in my own inertia, or whatever, and it eventually turned out that those heart breaks were really positive events in my life. So I understand why movies follow this script, but I was a little disappointed anyways and I will tell you why.<br /><br />There is a scene in the movie where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is sketching while watching his little sister play soccer. He has just had his heart broken and as soon as that scene came up I thought \\"Here we go! He is going to get back into architecture and get his life back on track! I know exactly how this story is going to end, there are no more surprises.\\" Then it cut to what he was actually sketching and, to my surprise, it was a picture of Summer (Zooey Deschanel) holding a bloody knife, and a dead, bloody body in the background, and I thought, \\"Yes! This movie forced me to jump to a hasty conclusion, and then stomped on it\\". I really love it when movies do that, when they play with the expectations of the audience, and with the familiar tropes, in order to surprise. I was so happy to see that bloody knife (never thought I would say that again).<br /><br />But it was only temporary. The movie wound up going the traditional route in the end. It was not a huge problem for me. It certainly did not ruin the movie for me, and I cannot really imagine any other ending that would have been any more satisfying. I just got so excited when I thought they were going to dash my expectations that I was disappointed when they did not. All in all, I think this movie is definitely worth watching. Especially if you happen to have a fever that only a romantic comedy can cure.ovie.

B0000019PA|5.0|I picked this up after reading about Amanda Palmer's influences on her wikipedia page.<br /><br />I am really impressed.<br /><br />They strike me as an amalgamation of several bands, but I can't put my finger on the exact combo. That might be because their sound transcends so many other bands from that era.<br /><br />The amazing combination of acoustic guitar with a variety of horns is haunting at times.<br /><br />The lyrics are intense, sometimes a bit on the overly negative side, but there can be no doubt that this band feels what they sing.<br /><br />One of my faves. Can't get these songs out of my head!

0670026182|5.0|Truly the most beautiful cookbook I've ever owned. Katie's incredible photos and the layout make this book a collector's item. I almost hate to use it for fear of messing it up, but I will definitely make the recipes. I've not heard of a lot of the dishes, probably because they are Irish and Australian, but I'm very eager to try them. This would make a fantastic Christmas gift for anyone who loves cooking and photography.
0393327345|4.0|Alienation / disassociation / dysfunction.  I am Joe's amateur book review.<br /><br />Meh.  You have all seen the movie.  The book is better, and worse.<br /><br />The author has delivered us a study in the unreliable narrator and done it with punchy sentences and colorful scenes.  What could have fallen flat, like a creative writing exercise transcends the gimmick and, in the end, satisfies.  It is entertaining and novel and, even if you have seen the movie (you have) you will enjoy the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't put it down. I couldn't believe how it ended and was ready to read the next book. The movie was emotionally charged and the book was even better. Definitely a must read.
0307352145|4.0|It was on Writer's Voice on my local college radio where I first heard about Susan Cain and her book \\"Quiet\\". I stopped whatever I was doing on my 'puter', got up to raise the volume and listen to her.<br />I then went to my favorite online bookstore, amazon - to 'wish' this book, to either buy it or to borrow from the library! I just spotted her book last week at the library, so naturally I got it to read. Less than one week: done!<br />To make this review a bit shorter than I originally thought, here is the nutshell. Both extro and intro have some fine gifts to give to the world, and knowing intros have gifts, is a wonderful insight, as well as knowing that intros are at least half the world's population.<br />Thank you Susan for a great book!

B005LAIH54|3.0|I truly enjoy the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.....However, I did not enjoy this Wrath of the Titans as well as I did Clash.....To my opinion, the movie had no strong story line....The only thing good about the movie which also has a lot of bad acting.....is the CG...They were great....I would rent before buying the disc.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app! Does exactly the job and it's free, I use this app all the time with no problems.
B009WJ2XT6|3.0|I agree that the music is not the sort of thing we've come to expect from the likes of John Barry or David Arnold at his best (Tomorrow Never Dies), but this is not really a James Bond film. The score has its own rewards and is appropriate for this particular film. As was done with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, only hints of the Bond theme are woven, often very subtly, into the music. Only in one cue, Breadcrumbs, is the veil momentarily ripped away entirely(and appropriately considering the content of the scene). Then we hear the James Bond theme played unabashedly for a few moments during what amounts to an amusing interlude, a nod to the past, and (please) hope for the future. Then the music and movie get back to the dark business at hand.<br /><br />I find the more I listen to Skyfall, the more interesting the score becomes. Some of the action cues are very good, and there is also a nice instrumental version of Adele's title tune heard in \\"Komodo Dragon\\".<br /><br />I say the score is appropriate because, although the movie contains the Bond elements, it is not like a \\"normal\\" Bond movie. Dark and psychological,leavened by flashes of humor, this third of the Daniel Craig films seems to complete an origin trilogy, with Bond finally becoming the 007 we know and love at the end. I'll be as vague as possible and say only say that the final scene of Skyfall has a welcome, familiar look to it, as if everything gets back to \\"normal\\" in Bond 24. Even in the gunbarrel closing, Craig seems to be imitating the Connery/Bob Simmons pose.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I didn't know exactly what level of performance I'd be getting from the PP1, but given the positive reviews and the low cost I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />The PP1 is very, very compact; slipped into a pocket, it doesn't remind you it's there.<br /><br />My first concern was ease and safety of use of such a small tool, but I found that not to be an issue.  Unless you're being careless - not a safe quality to possess when wielding even a dull knife - you should have no issue with using the PP1 effectively.  The 'thumb slot' gives good purchase by which to maintain a secure grip.<br /><br />My second concern was the sharpness it would afford to a blade.  I have an old, very dulled Browning 504 knife that it quickly restored to a near razor's edge in just a couple of minutes.  That, from an $8 sharpener, is a win in my book.<br /><br />There are certainly tools out there that will do the job faster and/or give an even sharper edge, but not at this price and in this compact a form-factor.
0547564651|5.0|Tough has written a brilliant book. He combines a solid synthesis of a range of scholarly work with useful examples. In an era that fetishizes No Child Left Behind's high-stakes testing, Tough pushes back firmly, if gently, arguing persuasively that other aspects of a child's education, especially those relating to character development, may well matter more. Though I've read (indeed, written about)some of these questions, I learned a lot from the book. It's indispensable reading for anyone with an interest in how our chilren are educated.

B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal adaptation, but if you're here, you know that. Everyone on here is b*tching about the quality of the 1995 Special Edition, but it's perfectly fine. The color is rich and warm and just the way it should be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book after the movie which sort of helped me situate the action and characters. But that is about all what the movie did for me. There is so much more in the book, so many details that make the story much more interesting than I was actually expecting.<br />So, it is time to get to the next one...
1451673442|4.0|Very inspiring book, I am still working to get a full understanding of how to effectively use it but for sure it is helping me to realise how lucky I am and how good my life has ever been, is and will be in the future.
B008C1O8CA|1.0|I heard them on a television program and liked the harmony but was disappointed when I received the CD and and every other line in the first three songs included 4-letter words.  I would not want to be playing this CD with children around.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This was a funny book about the whimsy and wisdom of cats.  It was light reading and cat owners can probably related to a lot of the short stories and<br />poems. I enjoyed reading it
B0083SBMBM|5.0|First and foremost I must confess that I am not an authority on Marvel comics nor can I tell you whether or not Joss Whedon's adaptation holds true to the history behind each character.  What I can tell you is that I am a super hero movie junkie.  I am a sucker for enticing action sequences and if things get blown up along the way even better.  In The Avengers you get that and so much more.  The whit and humor behind each of these characters is spot on and I had no idea I would laugh so much in a movie such as this.<br /> If each of the lead in movies such as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are base hits then The Avengers is a home run.  While you don't necessarily need to have seen each of these movies to understand the basis behind The Avengers it certainly helps.  You not only get an understanding as to the characters themselves but you already have a feel for the tension and teamwork to come. The only Avenger who does not have a plausible movie franchise built behind them is The Hulk.  (I am in no way taking into account the deplorable 2003 and 2008 attempts at taking on the franchise).<br /> One of my favorite roles in the previous movies as well as The Avengers was that of Agent Phil Coulson.  To me he was the heart of the team.  He unabashedly believed in \\"The Avenger Initiative\\" and with a straight face delivered some of the best lines in the movie.  While mocked at times its Agents Coulson's death that ultimately brings the unwillingly Avengers together.<br /> The first twenty to twenty five minutes of the movie are used as a set up letting us know that the Tesseract (an energy source) has been stolen by Loki (brother of Thor).  Nick Fury, Agent Coulson and the Black Widow all disseminate to pull together the main players, Tony Stark, Captain America and Bruce Banner.  With that the Avenger initiative is an initiative no more. In the remaining 114 minutes Thor joins the action as well as Hawkeye returns just as we and the team witness the afore mentioneddeath of Agent Coulson.<br /> It's been noted that Paramount spent around $260 million dollars to make The Avengers.  I have no idea what percentage of that went towards the salaries of the cast but it was worth every penny.  Thanks to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth we already have a connection to the respective characters that they embody.  Add to that illustrious mix of Mark Ruffalo, Scarlet Johansson, Tom Hiddleston and Jeremy Renner and you can see why I unabashedly love this movie.  No amount of special effects can make up for a bad cast and thankfully in The Avengers we never have to worry about that.<br /> Pulling together all of the essential elements from the cast, action sequences, movie score, and last but not least the writing Joss Whedon gives you the ultimate movie experience.  I have watched this movie at least fifteen times and never bore of it.  One would think that after a while the scenes would get methodical but I still get excited.  (it helps that the score by Alan Silvestri sets the pace perfectly).  Do yourself a favor and set aside a couple of hours and prepare to be amazed and entertained.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Since I picked up this series a little over two weeks ago I haven't gone to bed before 1-2am...this book did not disappoint!!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|The story, set in the late 21st century, centers around the crew of the spaceship Prometheus as they follow a star map discovered among the remnants of several ancient Earth cultures. The crew, seeking to find out the origins of humanity, arrive on a distant planet discovering an advanced civilization and a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.<br /><br />As most of you out there know; Prometheus is, actually, a prequel of sorts to the Alien movies. While the story precedes the events of the first Alien film, it's not directly related to the series. It takes place in the same universe, so to speak, but explores its' own storyline. While fans and critics alike disliked the movie for trying to go in its' direction, it's being mentioned across the internet that 20th Century Fox is pursuing a followup to this movie to be released no later than 2014, with Ridley Scott again taking Directorial duties.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It was a visual masterpiece. A real sight to behold.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very addictive. I don't like having to spend real money to get more trinkets. been freezing a lot lately. on small screen very hard to use download buttons.

B0000039QA|5.0|Biggie was legendary after his life was sadly cut short.  But man, his impact is tremendous.  He is one of the rappers who set the bar high for hip hop.  Hip hop completely dead now days, I wish modern day rappers would stop ruining a great artform.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book is a good read you can put this book down and return to it and not have to reread the last page to pick up the plot.
0307959856|1.0|this is one of the worst books i have ever read. the story is weak, predictable and just plain silly. i hate it when an author tries to create intrigue and mystery by using 'secret confessions.' the writing is poor, boring and unnecessarily wordy. There are so many stupid references to 'having refreshments.' ridiculous. it is a very pathetic attempt to try and write like Austen and i absolutely rolled my eyes at the reference to characters in Emma. so dumb. don't waste your time and money on this one.

B006JJBFK0|4.0|First of all, very beautiful music. Fans of Nightwish, Operatika, Thalion, and Leaves' Eyes will appreciate.<br /><br />Four stars only because I find it difficult to get used to an Alto/Mezzo lead; very unusual. I keep finding myself thinking \\"bring it up a third or a fifth.\\" It just doesn't sound quite right to me, as if the low tones of the heavy metal music are overpowering her voice. It is hard to understand her sometimes, as the voice blends into the music. Perhaps if the vocals were turned up; I just find the lack of contrast with the Alto voice making this album a little harder to appreciate. This is the band's first album with the singer, and I suspect as time goes on, she will learn to better incorporate her voice into the music.<br /><br />That said, it is still very beautiful music. It isn't \\"cheesy,\\" and though a keyboard is used for the \\"orchestra\\" parts, it doesn't sound too fake, as is the problem with a lot of symphonic metal. I run into a lot of \\"cheesy\\" symphonic metal, those trying to \\"copycat\\" other bands. This isn't that.<br /><br />If you like symphonic metal, put this on your list.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|I went into this movie thinking it must be bad (because of the reviews) but as I watched this movie and thought to myself, shouldn't the name have been Snake instead of Snow...  and how come Snow has 1 eye too many???  All he was missing was the eye patch.<br /><br />If you liked escape from New York or Escape from L.A. you will feel right at home with this one.  I think Guy Pearce does a super job in this movie, the cheesy comments, the comebacks!<br /><br />I was actually sad that the movie ended because I wanted more!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Always been a fan of Owl City's music, but never bothered digging deeper into their stuff. I stuck listening to the few tracks that had music videos on YouTube, until I saw this on sale and jumped. Great album with a lot of awesome songs, I actually found myself listening to the whole thing. Literally. I don't think there is any songs on this that I don't like, and that's rare and awesome I think because there is enough variety in here to keep you coming back again and again. To the point that each song started to grow on me one at a time after I got a little tired of my clear favorite (Metropolis).
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Something half expected and something very unexpected brings this story to its conclusion.  Mockingjay is a sad but fitting end to a great trilogy.
B004SBX112|5.0|Lots of fun and funny birds and complex and wierd groups to knock down.  A little harder than the original version.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Yes, I'm one of the few who still buy CD's, so when I find a group I love, I have to have the album!!  I found out about the Lumineers last winter, and I have to say that this album in its entirety is awesome!!  It's very folky, almost reminiscent of my grandma's time.  The songs are catchy and so fun!!  Can't wait for the next album!  :)
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I was not expecting this game to be such a hit, me and my son love it, I always have a great time playing it.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Although \\"Afterglow\\" starts differently from \\"Black Country Communion\\" and \\"2\\", it finishes considerably stronger. Big Train, This is Your Time, Afterglow, Dandelion, The Circle, Common Man, The Giver, and Crawl are all great songs. Some reviewers have drawn comparisons to music from The Who and Led Zepplin. I hear the Zepplin likenesses, but not so much The Who. Glenn Hughes is magnificent on the vocals, and, in some ways, this seems like another \\"Glenn Hughes\\" album (many of which are also excellent).
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is my son's favorite game, he's not even 3 years old and he plays it so good that I think any dad should try it with their kids, I mean it gets harder and harder but it's really an awesome game, I think the obstacles in this game can really stimulate your kid's mind helping him develop his brain functions.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are re-animated back again to tear each other apart in this action pack thriller. This one will completely throw you off the edge because it's starring a newcomer deadly soldier andrei &#34;the pitbull&#34; and the fights that they do are way vicious then the first movie. That was just an introduction to these universal soldiers of course. Van Damme like always, plays the part of the hero and his entry is way dramatic which makes him more like a real soldier. Dolph in the other hand was like a spark that caught me off-guard when Van Damme was killing all the bad guys. THESE SOLDIERS KNOW WHEN TO WAGE WAR!!!
1936608898|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Despite the random Americanisms (I am Australian) I really enjoyed the book and the slight challenge of absorbing information a little new to me.

B0063GORYU|4.0|The keyboard on the Amazon Fire is klunky, which distracts from the game play.  Otherwise the feature set is just what I was looking for!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I hesitated before giving the book a rating. I wouldn't go to two stars - the author is too talented for that. But I can't go to five, as the author also has some quirks, at least in this, his first book, that can be very distracting.<br /><br />Some of these quirks have been mentioned before; examples include<br /><br />The main character continually reminding us how dirt poor he is; and then constantly spending every last penny he's got.<br />The main character continually reminding us that this isn't \\"some story\\"; (And the author apparently missing the irony in the statements.)<br /><br />The author uses so_many_analogies. I respect his writing, I really do, because fact is, Rothfuss can turn a word! But there's a point where I start wondering, is he over-writing? Is he doing this to impress us? I just didn't get it.<br /><br />I was a little disjointed by some of the very modern conversations by some of the characters. If you read George R.R. Martin or Robert Jordan, et al - the characters speak in a way that fits the world they've created. But Rothfuss uses things like a \\"span\\" which, I guess is a week, but then his characters refer to days, minutes, years; why not just be consistent and call a week a week? He'll also use idioms, unique to his world like \\"safe as houses\\" that the characters might say, but then intersperse them with modern day idiomatic expressions. Again, for me, it'd jar me out of the story at times.<br /><br />My last gripe, is that the narrator (or other people who are speaking) would continually say how hard it is to describe something (or someone) and then proceed to do just that. At length and they'd use the technique over and over again.<br /><br />Having said all of the above, you might think I didn't like the book - quite the contrary, I found the story quite gripping. I liked Kvothe, particularly when he was at his most self-deprecating. I really enjoyed finding out the \\"truths\\" that Rothfuss painstakingly details in both the \\"before\\"and \\"after\\" setting. How he got the nickname \\"The Bloodless\\" for example, was a pretty early reveal. He does this continually through the book and I didn't find the story predictable at all. There were times when I thought for sure it would go a particular way, and then didn't, and for purely logical reasons.<br /><br />Yes, there were times when I thought the plot points were contrived (particularly the constant poverty stricken nature of the guy - why didn't he just play the lute more at the Eolian, where Ambrose obviously didn't have any say?) - but overall, I really enjoyed the plot.<br /><br />I imagine if I were to write the short version of this review, I'd say this:<br /><br />Rothfuss is a master word-smith; but, he needs to tone it down a bit. It's almost as if his words are to him what the \\"candy\\" is to the sweet-eaters in the story. (Ha! I end with an analogy!)<br /><br />Oh, and I'll be buying the rest of the series. ;) Four stars it is, then!

B008MG1E4A|2.0|The author correctly points out that Saudi Arabia is governed by a brutal corrupt and despotic regime that keeps its people subjugated and impoverished.  But he forgot to point out that this is possible only with the support and military backing of the United States.  In effect the US makes sure the people of that country remain subjugated, for which the government, i.e., the Saudi family, makes sure the US receives the country's oil resources at favorable prices.  Osama Bin Laden, a member of the Saudi family, seeing that the US corrupted his own family at the expense of his country's people, first turned against the Soviets and then the US and his own family in order to free and/or avenge the subjugation of his countrymen. He's not my hero, but he's not what the propaganda says he is either. Bin Laden also sought revenge for what he says was the murder of over half a million Muslim children by the United States [...] when the Clinton administration bombed various parts of Iraq's infrastructure and then enforced an embargo which they knew would impoverish and deprive hundreds of thousands of children of food, medicines, and sanitation facilities causing hunger, starvation, malnutrition, sickness and death among the population, but mostly children.  The US claimed that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the destruction of the twin towers on 9/11, but never offered any proof that he was involved in any way.  Bin Laden celebrated the event but denied he was responsible for it.  The bulk of the evidence in my view suggests that 911 was probably an inside job.  Thousands of experts around the world, including over 1,500 American pilots, architects, structural engineers, demolition experts, physicists, chemists and other scientists have petitioned the US for an honest and proper investigation to explain all the evidence that contradicts the official story, (such as why Building 7 collapsed at freefall speed, even though it was never hit by any airplane).  No such investigation has taken place.  So while the Obama administration celebrates and takes credit for the murder of Osama Bin Laden, those who committed crimes against the children of Iraq, and the people of Saudi Arabia, and the American people, and our troops and others who were unwittingly induced to participate in those crimes, have yet been brought to justice. I feel sorry for the author's parents who tried to do their best for their son. Unfortunately what they couldn't do is teach him how to think for himself.  Or maybe they did succeed.  The book appears to be written by a professional writer, probably the imbedded journalist.  I'm sure this book will inspire a lot of kids to follow in the author's footsteps. They will become elite professionals who will do what they are asked to do, which, unfortunately, is unlikely to forward the cause of freedom.  The book is a very well written piece of propaganda, which not surprisingly leaves out the essential truth and significance of the operation.

B008M34INW|2.0|I love Mel Gibson for his many top notch movies.<br /><br />I just didn't think 'Get The Gringo' was a good movie. It had the setting to be a special Movie, but I feel it was far below Mel Gibson's standards. I think Mel was fine but the screenplay was below average.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|its not the worst...its better than youtube. just get it if you want to, and if you don't, don't get it
B0075LTOR2|5.0|This box set contains no booklet, no story or essays, nothing to grasp. All you can do is listen to the music itself, and it sounds incredible. The remastering itself is what attracted me to this set, because I had heard so much about it. The dynamic range is incredible, the transfer is incredible, and the packaging is incredible, especially for the price. A very convenient way to get it all in one place, and to put all of this work in one package at less than a hundred dollars, you shouldn't even think twice.

If that doesn't sound appealing to you, don't do it. But if you're even slightly interested and have the money for it, don't hesitate. The packaging is beautiful, the first five albums and the rarities have been remastered and they aren't as extreme as the ones on Midlife. It's literally perfect. You could make four more incredible albums just off the B-sides and rarities included. All of that being said, it's missing a few harder to find songs, but it's nitpicking at this point. Future box set compilers should take note, this sets the bar.
0316019984|5.0|This item was a gift for my nephew. I knew it was a pop up book, but it was so incredible! When I received it and opened it I was amazed and satisfied with my purchase. My nephew loved it too. This is s wonderful gift for any child who collects comic books.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|I'm a fan of consistencies, especially with packaging. Taking a cue from the Beatles remasters (as many others, such as the ABKCO Rolling Stones ones, I'm sure), these, the Paul McCartney ones, and the newly released Beach Boys ones all look great. The remasters are fantastic, I'm in the camp of finding the original releases more important than remixes (for the most part). I got this for around eighty dollars, and it's definitely worthwhile if you can get it around there. Some Time in New York City, Mind Games, and Walls & Bridges are all unjustly maligned in my opinion, and I find them all worth revisiting. His story is probably more well known than his music after the Beatles (besides Imagine, obviously), but there isn't an album here I don't love or recommend.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|The reason I titled this review Quantum of Sleepiness is that even though I watched it 2 weeks ago I am having trouble remembering much about it.  No, I'm not suffering from dementia or consciousness altering substance use.  Its just that in the normal topography of life, this movie did not make much of an impact... I'll tell you what is bleeding trough my memory, though, slowly... On general James Bondness I'll give it a 4.5-it did satisfy the general urge to have a wounded, arrogant, cute, smokin' hot insanely sneaky-capable badass good guy fix- that much I can tell you.. And there were a few choice scenes with Dame Judy Dench as M.... And there was this bad guy who had a great sinister creepy vibe about him, in a French way... Oh yeah, that's right there was a modicum of emotional release/possibly forgiveness/letting go at the denouement that briefly garnered my interest.. Beyond that, not too much impact.  Oh wait, there was a naked woman covered in oil, it's flashing back on me now. There you have it- if you need a no brainer JB film that won't tax you too much on any front but will give some wan degree of nostalgic comfort via images of our favorite british action figure, see it!
B001FBJULI|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase the reissues due to all of the reports of pressing errors, but after purchasing Brotherhood at a record store and seeing that it was fine, I went ahead and ordered the others through here. I have all of them now, and I just wanted to let everyone know that they've been fixed. We all know that these are all worth five-stars, no need to elaborate on that. If you haven't bought them yet or had faulty ones that haven't been replaced, it's worth it now.

0345535421|5.0|A Clash of Kings is the second book in George R. R. Martin's excellent, epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. Those new to the series should certainly begin with the first book, A Game of Thrones, rather than this book but, very briefly, it takes place in Westeros and is a mammoth tale of treachery, greed and war about the various threats that plague the Seven Kingdoms south of the Wall.<br /><br />Beginning right where A Game of Thrones left off, in A Clash of Kings the Seven Kingdoms are in danger of being torn apart by civil war as each of the families seek to claim the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, the Night Watch are given the additional burden of sending a reconnaissance force north of the Wall to investigate the Wildings who live there. Further trouble lies in the East where Daenerys Targaryen has fled accompanied by Jorah Mormont, her few remaining loyal followers and three newly hatched dragons.<br /><br />This is another fantastic book in this immense series. Martin has put so much thought into the series and, unlike many fantasy writers, this includes thought about the characters as well as the plots. Both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings are real character driven yarns and, despite the massive cast featured in each of them, everyone comes across as being fully-developed and convincing. This concentration on making the characters believable and relatable is also reflected in the fact that this series is far grittier than many fantasy sagas. Martin really brings out the squalor and strife that plague the people of the Seven Kingdoms. A Clash of Kings is a brutal and exciting book that hooked me from the very beginning.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire is one of my favourite fantasy series and I would recommend it wholeheartedly to fans of The Belgariad, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Lord of the Rings and other classics of the genre.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Exactly what I expected.  A brand new controller that was delivered quickly and was in perfect working order I do not have any complaints.
0061433063|5.0|Tiffany Aching is a trainee witch and has served as the main character in The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith and I Shall Wear Midnight. Although not technically part of the 'proper' Discworld series, Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching novels are set on the Disc, predominantly in the Chalk and Ankh Morpork, and are in keeping with the general tone and aesthetic of the series. The reason that these four novels are generally excluded from the main Discworld cannon is that they are classed as children's books and so are more often found in the Teenage section of bookshops rather than the Fantasy section. I, however, believe, like many long-term Pratchett fans, that such a distinction is artificial and that the Tiffany Aching stories are just as worthy of being read and appreciated by adults as all the rest of the great books that Sir Terry has written so far.<br /><br />The title of I Shall Wear Midnight comes from a quote in A Hat Full of Sky attributed to Tiffany Aching: \\"When I'm old I shall wear midnight, she'd decided. But for now she'd had enough of darkness.\\" It's fitting therefore that the Tiffany Aching in this book is more grown-up and facing far more perilous dangers in this novel than she has in the previous three.<br /><br />It's not easy being a witch but Tiffany Aching has always done her best, but just recently her best doesn't seem to be good enough anymore. An ancient evil has arisen, an ancient evil that drags up stories about wicked old witches and makes the very act of wearing a pointy hat seem like a decidedly bad idea. There's worse yet to come, as this particular ancient evil is hunting down one witch in particular - our Tiffany of course - and he's finally been able to track her down .<br /><br />I Shall Wear Midnight is another fabulous Discworld novel filled with adventure, laughs, witches and magic. It has been a delight to watch Tiffany grow and develop her powers and to find her witchy place in the world. This is the darkest novel featuring her to date as Tiffany is here forced to shoulder the full responsibility for her steading and all the human failings that come with it. There are some excellent cameos from Discworld regulars to enjoy here: the Nac Mac Feegles, Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and even Death all pop up to help Tiffany achieve her moment in the sun. Terry Pratchett is a master of fantasy but he's also a fantastic humorist and this book had me laughing out loud in many places. Despite the humour, this latest outing for Tiffany Aching is actually quite profound and emotional on the subject of good versus evil and on the idea of growing into one's responsibilities. I Shall Wear Midnight is the perfect ending to a wonderful series of books.
B001CXDNWG|4.0|It is a good album for Limp Bizkit fans.  It contains some songs that were not played on the radio. Nevertheless, it is pretty cool.
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the first book in George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin actually began the series back in 1996 and has published five novels in the saga so far, but A Song of Ice and Fire is experiencing a surge in popularity at the moment as Sky TV have begun showing the HBO adaptation of A Game of Thrones. I'm stuck with pauper TV unfortunately but was intrigued by the trailers for the show and so decided to read the books.<br /><br />The plot of A Game of Thrones in particular, and the overarching story of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole, is incredibly detailed and involved but, by way of extreme summary, it is a tragic tale of treachery, greed and war that threatens the unity of the Seven Kingdoms south of the wall. Set in a fabulous world scarred by battle and catastrophe during over 8000 years of recorded history, A Game of Thrones tells of the deeds of men and women locked in the deadliest conflicts and the terrible legacy that will ultimately be left for their children. As a terrible winter swirls in the lands beyond the wall, the undead and the neverborn prepare to invade the realms of men...<br /><br />This is an absolutely staggering book. There is so much detail as to character and plot that I had to almost battle to keep it straight in my head - the genius and creativity of George R. R. Martin astounds me. A Game of Thrones is a fairly epic book at well over 800 pages, but it grabbed me from the very beginning and I absolutely raced through it as I got swept along by the battle and intrigue. This is a fantasy novel clearly but it is still dark and gritty and Martin manages to keep a chilly, melancholic tone hovering over the characters as they make decisions which threaten the very balance of their world. While the fantasy staples of dragons, monsters and magic are present in this world, Martin keeps them very much in the background as he concentrates on the human relationships and interactions between his sprawling cast of characters.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is perhaps not the best read for the faint-hearted or for those with weak stomachs but I absolutely loved it and believe that George R. R. Martin has now taken over from Raymond Feist as the benchmark by which I will judge fantasy writers. If you're after an intelligent fantasy novel that is rather light on magic but brim full of murder, mayhem, warfare and political intrigue then A Game of Thrones is an absolute must-read.<br /><br />I should warn you: don't make the same mistake I did and buy only the first book in the series - after finishing A Game of Thrones I can pretty much guarantee you that you'll want to race straight on into A Clash of Kings!wling cast of characters.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is perhaps not the best read for the faint-hearted or for those with weak stomachs but I absolutely loved it and believe that George R.

B004P1JEWU|5.0|The same as with the previous two books in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, I enjoyed this one just as much. Maybe a little more, considering a certain character I hated with a passion, finally got we he had coming to him. Unfortunately, two other well-loved characters are also murdered, but my absolute favorite one manages to survive to make a re-appearance in the next book in this fantastic series. I know I said it in my previous reviews, but I can't stres enough how super impressed I am with this author's writing. His imagination clearly has no limits. The cliffhanger ending was completely unforseen, but has me excited to read the next book in this series!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|it is boring and I hate it. who would play this? bleck.<br />it is a waste of time. DO NOT GET THIS HORRID APP
034580404X|5.0|I didn't buy this set right away because I almost never care for the ones that get so popular but Im glad I did. It was a good read. I would however like to know more from Christians side. Another set should follow from his side of everything. Thered be a lot of psychology with it...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the story and was surprized. By the ending. Never suspected thetwists and turns it had..will passit on to my daughter to read.
B009A9ETFE|5.0|I absolutely love HIM and this band has become one of my favorites as soon as I started listeing to them. Ville Valo has the most beautiful melodic voice I have ever heard and the sound of HIM is so unique and awesome and I just love it. I love every song on this album and have been listening to it nonstop since I got it! I put it on every night when I go to bed and I can fall asleep easily listening to Ville's melodic voice. Love HIM and love Ville Valo <3
B007VDPE32|5.0|His music is almost always great. I don't understand why he is not more popular. My favorites are Jericho, Montauk, Perfect Man, Respectable Dive. However, I think Rufus does his very best on his own with no help from producers. He shouldn't try to be popular, just keep being himself.
B009329ZF2|5.0|battleship was very interesting movie wanted to see rihanna act good thing she was not the only star lol lots of aliens and lots of action give it a chance and check it out you will enjoy it
B0076DCT2G|2.0|80 percent of the book, could be condensed to a quarter of the pages devoted to it. Expected more from DeMille.

0143039482|3.0|I was looking forward to reading it because I read Steinbeck a long time ago and enjoyed his witing. This book, however, was a struggle for me to fininsh. There were people in the book group who liked it. I guess I'd have to say it is okay.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It is a total waste of space! Forget the one star I give it a no star. But I have to admit it did work for a little while. I mean who wants an app that crashes! If the game did not crash I would give it five stars! I loved this game. And now........I cant even get it on my computer!!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|While critics are not impressed, this is a well written complex work but the very dark point of view feels as a burden the reader must carry.  It reminds me of Elizabeth George's What Came Before He Shot Her, another tumble of characters living in fear, poverty, and despair.  The inevitable comparison to Potter is that while he, too, lived a dark life, he had the magic to rise above, literally and figuratively.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The President's Club is absolutely a Five Star read.  The authors have written a moving tribute to the Presidents for whom the Office transcends beyond the individual.  What a great history lesson about our government.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|So glad they made this one. Hope to see them together again. There movies where very good on there own.  BUT, together they are the best.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching this VN era movie.  It was good insofar as being an action and war movie.  But, what truly set it apart for me was that it contained both the triumphs and the errors that occur in the midst of kaos.  The people portrayed faced difficult challenges and improvised on the spot to meet the pain head on.  This is clearly one of the better war movies I have seen.  Too many are simply violent for the sake of violence, or just anti war messages that disregard the truth for the sake of a making a buck and altering the viewers' opinions on a war.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Yes, H. G. Rider had already written his Allan Quartermain novels as well as She, but the birth of the first action hero wasn't until 1912 with Edgar Rice Burroughs's science fiction fantasy (published in a mens magazine) A Princess of Mars (two years before Tarzan the Ape Man). Here we see the first super hero/fighting man that inspired not only Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Rocky Jones, Commando Cody, Captain Kirk, Luke Skywalker and Starbuck but also inspired Superman, Batman, Captain America, Green Lantern, The Lone Ranger, Thor, Iron Man, Green Hornet and Indiana Jones (with a little Allan Quartermain dashed in for flavor!). Larger than life heroes battling impossible odds, possessing special skill sets or an arsenal of weaponry (usually \\"borrowed\\" from the bad guys) and then there's the beautiful princess that needed rescuing and the arena of death plot device are all from the feverish mind of Mr. Burroughs.<br /><br />John Carter, a Virginia gentleman dies in a cave during an Indian War and then wakes up on Mars wearing only his birthday suit, which is okay because everyone else on Mars (Barsoom) prefers their birthday suits as well (harnesses and insignia are usually all any of them wear) and then he goes about conquering the bad guys that later inspired Ming, the Draconians, the Cylons, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Emperor and even Darth Vader; this list is endless because it would also include Sinestro, Lex Luthor, Ra's Al Ghul, Red Skull, Dr. Doom, The Mandarian, Loki, Baltar and Butch Cavindish. You see where this is going...<br /><br />There are fifteen-foot tall, four-armed creatures with nasty underbitten tusks, flying skiffs, swordplay, incredible jumping and wicked explosions...oh, and the incomprable Dejah Thoris being kidnapped as a matter of routine (much the way Jane was in Tarzan); there are cavalry officers, apache Indians, warring tribes, psycho priests, forgotten gods, dictators, assassins, thieves, mad doctors, chessmen, would-be rapists, warriors, weird mating rituals, great white apes, vast deserts, inter-special mating (and the children thereof) and the occasional introduction by Mr. Burroughs himself. And that's just the 11 books that comprise the Martian Tales.<br /><br />This movie actually blends elements of the first three books, A Princess of Mars, The Gods Of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, and is a feast for the eyes. The imagery reflects the literature in many areas, regardless of the usual theatrical changes experienced from the translation of book-to-screen. I was thoroughly impressed, moreso because I've grown bored with Disney's inability to rise above dorky kiddie fare; however, Disney allayed all of my fears of a dumbbed-down travesty and gave me something that sits proudly among the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of celluoid if which it inspired. Of course, Disney now has Marvel and its lengthy host of heroes and villains to lavish the screen with like the Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man and Thor).<br /><br />Herein lies the swordplay of Flash Gordon and Luke Skywalker; herein lies the much-lusted after princesses Ardala, Aura and Leia (don't forget Padme, can't forget her!); herein lies the grandiose battles of Mongol, Tatooine and all points spaceward; herein lies giant monsters and deadly arenas that leering villains like Ming, Count Dooku, Killer Kane, the Klingons or Jabba the Hut are entertained with prior to their downfall; herein lies the skiffs, gadgets and back backs of Commando Cody, Buck Rogers, Bobba Fett and Imperial Biker Scouts; herein lies the genesis of so much that we take for granted.<br /><br />I've heard people tell me that John Carter rips off Star Wars, Star Trek and blah blah blah, but this only shows the limits of a literature-starved America within the vast wasteland of dullness.<br /><br />John Carter, cavalry officer of Virginia, Warlord of Barsoom and betroved of the incomprable Dejah Thoris is the great-great-grandaddy of all the action heroes of the 20th Century pop culture.<br /><br />Thank you, Disney, for doing something totally cool!<br /><br />A Princees of Mars was previously made as a low-budget Scy Fy TV movie (2009) starring the still lovely Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris and Antonio Sabato Jr. as an Iraq War-era John Carter; nothing at all like the recent John Carter but rather faithful to the plot of the first book.<br /><br />John Carter is Charlton Heston's real name but he changed it so it wouldn't be confused with the Burroughs's character; Heston's career seemed to parallel his literary namesake (Colonel George Taylor of Planet of the Apes is another of those classic action heroes).<br /><br />There is an even longer pedegree of the origin of the great action hero of legend (King Arthur, anyone?) we could delve into, but we'll leave this exploration for now and revel in the excitement of yesterday's hero exploding on the screen today.<br /><br />5 stars and beyond!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is 7$ but it is worth every penny!!! I have a kindle fire and it works perfectly on it!!!
0061743526|5.0|This classic novel by Harper Lee is about a young girl, Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed \\"Scout\\"), growing up in Depression-era Alabama with her widowed lawyer father, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem. The story vividly describes race relations in the South in the 1930s. The novel describes how Atticus's decision to take on a controversial rape case affects the family's relationships with the townspeople in their hometown, fictional Maycomb, Alabama. The novel also describes Scout's struggles in growing up such as dealing with school and her curiosity about a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. One of the best parts of the novel was Atticus Finch giving the closing argument in the rape trial. Atticus states that, in the eyes of the law, everyone is equal. The novel was published in 1960 during the Civil Rights Movement. Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the novel, and it was made into a 1962 motion picture starring Gregory Peck.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Harry Potter series, but I didn't enjoy this book. I think it was clearly because the only character I could even kind of like died in the first chapter. I'd skip it if I had to do it again.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book totally blew me away.  I was pulled in by each character's sheer will of existance.  Proving that each and every person who touches our lives is an intricate and complex person dealing, living and wanting their own things.  That we are each integral parts of others existance as well as their undoings.  The book touched me and stuck with me when I was away from it and it haunted me long after I had finished it.<br /><br />The lives of Charlie, Sam and Patrick as well as each and every one they cross, love and avoid will have you wondering if you yourself have been the importance of being someone's life or their lifeline.<br /><br />I recommend it with a full box of tissues...

B009A9EPLM|5.0|It saddens me to see there are reviews that try to compare John Williams recent output to that of his past. As a serious orchestral composer, I have watched and listened to him grow artistically in a manner reminiscent to our masters of the past 300 years of music history. He's not going to write music like he did 30 years ago. His orchestration style has become more dense and focused, his melodic lines longer and more complex, his harmonic palette ridiculously advanced. This is master craftsman and our nation's greatest living composer at work. And in LIncoln, those talents are openly displayed. The music is simply breathtaking, beautifully orchestrated and as dense as ever. Yet the clarity of line as of late never ceases to astound the ear. At times I feel Williams channeling Mozart or Ravel. What I mean is that there is a richness and complexity to the music yet every line is crystaline and seems that it inevitably had to sound like this.<br /><br />The Chicago Symphony plays with precision and sweeping dynamics, reaffirming their status as One of the Five. Easily one the year's best scores. I was particularly stunned with Malice Towards None and it's passionate string lines. Highly recommend this one. Like Waxman, Goldsmith, and Korngold, John Williams' music functions as a strong support or emotional center to the image its written for as well as standing up as serious concert music. A remarkable feat.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a long story that has enough going on, creatively expressed to keep the reader's interest from beginning to end.  The character development creates people who are loveable, hateable and some who put you in a position of being caught between the two extremes.  Not a big surprise coming from Stephen King but definately a relief for those of us looking for a book we don't want to put down and just can't wait to pick up again.  Thanks Stephen! :)

B004MYFV0O|5.0|I have been successfully painting for many years now which is my passion.  Drawing and perspective always seemed a bit daunting as I now realize that I had never been taught the basics.  I could seldom draw successfully from imagination alone without the use of references which is severely limiting.<br />Having had  no formal art training, my weekly art lessons as an adult with various teachers never covered all the areas comprehensively enough to give me drawing confidence.<br />This book is so easy and refreshing to follow and has given me a new outlook and enthusiasm for drawing for the sake of drawing.<br />I think this book can be of great assistance to many artists beginners or advanced who are lacking knowledge of the drawing basics.  I'm sure that my paintings are going to be positively influenced by my new-found skills.<br />A very enjoyable book!

B0096PAA6E|3.0|I have to admit, I fell on the Gary Clark Jr. Hype train that came sweeping across the nation in 2011. Here was a guitarist that had some killer raw hill-country-esque blues guitar songs, excellent energy, a killer voice, and a terrific backing band. When I heard Bright Lights, it sealed the deal with me. I watched his performance from this year's Bonnaroo, and I was also sold. This guy was killer. So, when I heard that the debut album would be dropping on October 22nd (my birthday, to be exact), I knew I had to get it. I was firmly convinced that this guy is the \\"real deal.\\"<br /><br />Then I heard the album.<br /><br />And while I still believe he's got some goods, it changed my opinion of him completely. While I do think he's a demon guitar player, I think his detours into R&B are complete missteps. Which resulted in an inconsistent and jumbled mess of an album. Just what exactly is he trying to prove on here? Is he a Texan-raised blues guitarist? Or is he a John Legend soul singer? Well, on this, he's trying to do both. And while I do respect an artist for wanting to bring diversity, the R Kelly-esque songs with Auto Tune (Really?) and drum machines do ABSOLUTLY NOTHING FOR ME WHATSOEVER. They're just dreadful to listen to. The keyboards sound glitchy and out of tune, the drum beat sounds ripped straight from Fruity Loops, and the over-production of it all really sickens me. It sounds more like Babyface and R Kelly than a guy proclaiming to be \\"the next Hendrix.\\"<br /><br />That being said, there are 8 good tracks that are worth your time. Ain't Messing Around is fantastic Muscle Shoals soul funk with killer guitar playing. The tone even sounds Hendrixian. When My Train Pulls In is a fantastic minor-keyed blues rocker, with one of the best guitar solos you will ever hear. Bright Lights is....well, Bright Lights. Not much else needs to be said other than it burns. Travis County is a good Stones-ish rocker, quite surprising from this guy. Glitter Ain't Gold has a Stevie Wonder boogie to it, along with a VERY fuzzy bassline. Numb might be the heaviest thing on here, a stomping riff and dirty dirty production. Finally, the medley of Hendrix and Allen Collins is absolutley amazing, and it all ends with Next Door Neighbor Blues, a Mississippi-delta blues song with dobro and bass drum. Very cool.<br /><br />The other songs, stay away from. Especially the title track and The Life. Those are the worst insults on the album, something that sounds like top 40 Usher B-sides. Download the good stuff, people, maybe the next time, Gary will realize what he's great at.Stevie Wonder boogie to it, along with a VERY fuzzy bassline.

B008OOYALE|5.0|great game the only thing I have problems with is it freezing up. I still give it five stars because it is so addicting
B007IXWL2C|5.0|An excellet series of books.  I believe many readers of book 1 would stop too soon, thinking it was a high grade porn book.  Though there is quite alot of sexual intimacy in book 1, I saw the book as a study of a man and women from different walks and upbringings in life and how each change to finally complete an engrossing love story.
0066620996|4.0|Although it was often repetitive, the scope of the research is worthy of reading.  There is so much that combats conventional wisdom about \\"what makes a great company\\" that you're constantly hoping for the next big surprise.  I love reading business biographies, and this has a number of associated stories throughout.  You learn about the companies that \\"look good\\" yet aren't nearly as profitable as other, more understated companies.  You realize that the big offices and powerful motivational seminars aren't worth much.  In fact, you'll end up treating them as counterproductive.<br />Just hearing that what makes a successful company is based on a continual \\"turning of the wheel\\" is important to reiterate.  It takes great leaders who are looking for a long-term commitment to the success of their organization. -SG
B009XY97VC|5.0|A truly worthy followup to Archangel. Every bit as epic and enjoyable. If you're a Two Steps From Hell fan, you will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Well written, but a little too gory for me. The author certainly brought the characters to life. So much so that you could almost hear the hungry stomachs growling and feel the pain of losing a loved one in a senseless battle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not only about erotism, but also about what is behind Grey's attitudes towards life. This is what makes this book so good and I can't wait to read the next one: Book two.[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like her other two books, Mockingjay is really well written. However, I never finished this one, because it was too violent for me. I had bought all three of her books without understanding the subject, then waded through the first two. This one I put aside. I admire the writing talent and the imagination.
030759565X|5.0|So much fun to flip through. I'm pumped to try the ribs. Not all of the recipes are right for me - and I've adapted some for my own liking - but I still love the book.<br /><br />I tried the leek latkes to start. It's gotten me thinking about other stuff I can do with veggies / latke's
B0013F1D02|3.0|The overall story was pretty good, but it was unnecessarily violent. This is not a kids' movie. I could have done without Robert De Niro prancing around in womens' underwear as well. I enjoyed it - the ghosts were funny - but it could have been a lot better.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is stunning in every way, beginning with its raw, believable renditions of the 19th, 20th, 21st and even the 22nd and 24rd centuries! Not to mention its raw, bloody violence and its lush eroticism. The film is nearly 3 hours of tension and drama, eased only a little by a comic drama involving elders trying to escape a nursing home. The film has the same characters - played by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, a wonderful Doona Bae and others - meeting each other (reincarnation is assumed) through the centuries. During each age, the characters struggle with a crisis - from post-apocalyptic barbarity to hyper-mechanized servitude, to African slaving, to the doomed relationship of homosexual lovers. There is something so over the top about each of these intertwined episodes - they are so memorably imagined and original: a car plunging into the depths of a river; a futuristic hydrofoil skimming the surface of an ocean; an ancient observatory unfolding its petals; computer screens magically forming in thin air; a gruesome factory abattoir; a dormitory for waitress slaves. The makeup that allowed the actors to play so many parts was wonderful - making Asians into Caucasians into Blacks - in ways that were sometimes obvious and sometimes not!  Tom Hanks outdid himself, convincingly playing characters with numerous accents, personalities and ages. But Doona Bae, as a \\"replicant\\" waitress who awakes to the horror around her, was the star of the film. Her vulnerability and dawning awareness were masterfully depicted.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a tour de force - a brilliant movie that reimagines the same human struggles continuing over the ages, and human relationships surviving the limits of death and disintegration.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I read this novel a few days ago and I found it beautiful but I think it is more slow than \\"The secret keeper\\", but I really recommend you this book. The history is about women that love and the brotherhood so, it really worth it!
B007FZ7R7W|3.0|Its ok .But wayyyyy too much autotune on every song. And the new songs are all techno based and dont even sound right because he is a r&b artist.  He can do better
B005KELR3A|4.0|Used this for my new Paperwhite for about two weeks now.  It's a great fit.  Seems durable, cushioned, and I love the grip on the patterned portion.  I'd recommend in every sense except that there's no way to charge the Kindle while leaving it in the case because the zipper doesn't go around far enough on the top/bottom.  My other Belkin case for my Kindle 2nd gen allows me to leave the device in the case, leave a small section of the zipper open, and charge while keeping it protected.  I'd recommend a new design that allows that.  Otherwise, definitely satisfied.

B00633W614|1.0|I bought this book with high hopes. I did enjoy the first book, but, oh my, was this one awful. Trying to come out with one too soon?  Or?? I don't know, first the whole plot is so preposterous and yet so predictable.  The entire time there is the overwhelming feeling of having read this before, &lt;Sigh>. So bad.  This is one to either wait for a paperback, or a used paperback, or give it a total pass.
075669812X|4.0|They'll be discontinuing Ninjago in 2013, so this will make a neat collector's item in the future.  Includes a minifigure but the book as a whole maintains a better appearance if you leave him where he is....You can get him out without damaging the cover though. Photos of every Ninjago character, dragon and set as well as detailed bios and vital information on how to be a ninja.  Although this is smaller than the Harry Potter edition of this kind, it's a full book and your Lego fan is unlikely to be disappointed. This was intended for my 7 year old and eventually he'll get it-I really like this book.

B004LROUW2|4.0|It is a long book. The first time I read it, it was only a chapter per night. I am halfway through the book for the second time and it is holding up well. It is not a story to be rushed through. It is a leisurely stroll, in my opinion.<br />As for the translation, I am not sure. My wife is fluent in Japanese, which is the language she read. We have conversations about this, and other Murakami books, without too much misunderstanding.<br />I liked it and look forward to reading more from this author.

0812992784|1.0|I never followed Rushdie to know him as a person. I read his Satanic Verses, and being a non-beliver, it mad me angry that he intentionally and purposly, without any contest to the story, tried to insult some one whom people belived as their prophet. If it was not fatwa and banning of his book, he may not have reached these super heights. He talks about 'creativity', 'freedom of speech' shamefully. Will he call my comments as my freedom, if I describe his mothers genitals and his father's animal sex acts, or his sisters private parts. He is a criminal but with a talent. In his book Joseph Anton, he frankly admits what he actually is- a hyper, trouble maker, selfish, disloyal to his country England, his father, and every one who ever loved him or taken care of him. He is a base, low life but has talent of writing. He is a blot on education and civilization. [[ASIN:0812992784 Joseph Anton: A Memoir]]

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good Grisham, even if a tale based 100% on fiction.  He keeps you in suspense as to where its going until the end and certainly different from his usual lawyers story. Continues to show why he is one of the country's most popular writers.
B0091V6TF4|3.0|I would have bought this even though I have most of the songs if they had included Skyfall....a great Bond song. Worse Bond song: jack White's Die Another Day. Not even close to a Bond song. He is seriously overated anyway.
B007P7UF06|1.0|Neither my wife or I found this film engaging; in fact we got about half way through and stopped watching it.  The quality of the blu-ray disk is nearly perfect.  The images are clear, the colors vibrant, the sound stage nicely spread out considering the age of the film.  We just didn't like the director's constant cutting, extreme close ups and extraneous camera movement that didn't seem to add anything.  We also found it hard to emotionally engage with the characters.  We love musicals, we love the music for Camelot we just did not care for this movie.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Good time killer while I am at work. I can see what deals I can find while I am on lunch and break...
B009GEOLM4|1.0|I must have missed the \\"Animated\\" portion of the description for this movie before I ordered it.  My wife and I were quite disappointed that it was a cartoon.  On the positive side, Amazon refunded my money for the purchase and I plan thoroughly review the description next time before I even put a movie on my Watchlist.

1416955070|4.0|First I would like to say that I am a book addict, I buy and read any book that catches my attention since the age of six and that was a looong time ago. But if the author doesn't capture my interest from the first pages, he lost me; therefore I do not read every crap ever written. I have my standards. And this book I read twice...<br />City of Bones drives us in a fantastic world, where all important supernatural beings are present. You have nephilims, werewolves, vampires, fairies, warlocks all mixing in a very intricate maze. The characters are very well described, enough details to allow you to visualize them. Well, I can say the book cover is a plus, catches your eye instantly, great choice by the way, and the whole runes/marks thing that cover the nephilim skin/body is something new. Better that the 'sparkling vampires' from the Twilight series.<br />Magnus Bane is by far my favorite character, unusual in a colorful/ intelligent way but the whole story is concentrated on the duo Clary-Jace.<br />Two missing things: first of all Clary needed to be able to fight a little; she is big-mouthed but mainly a liability in battle, not ok. Secondly, Jace's change of personality when he meets his/their father seems a little forced, but this is just my opinion.<br />The rest of the characters like the gay sensible Alec, Amazonian but affectionate Isabelle, the nerd (soon to be vampire) Simon and the librarian werewolf Luke have their panache so overall a very interesting reading.
B008OOYALE|3.0|fun game but there is no way I can give five stars to reward such greed. when you first buy land it is only a dollar or so. but as you buy more they up the price even though the plots of land are the same size. they are hoping you get hooked and spend more and more money. its fun if you have money, otherwise kind of slow.
0553801473|5.0|I normally don't review anything, but I have jump in to say that people obviously don't understand what Martin is about in the series.  Sure this book did not move the plot much, but there is so much insight into the characters and that's really what the series is about.  If you want a nice straight forward story, go read something else.  I can read another five books of him barely moving the plot as long as he keeps writing this way.  I have an attachment to all the characters (whether it be good or bad) and I love it.  Sure, it has some boring moments, but alas most books do that are this long.<br />Also all these people that skip chapters...why even bother, this series is not meant for you.<br />So if the journey is more important than the destination, then you will probably like this book.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Who else can make songs about breakups so catchy? In line with other TS albums so if you liked those you won't be disappointed.
B0086700CM|1.0|I'm sorry, but I could not understand how this game works.  It looked like it could be fun, but I could not make the character perform the way it probably should.  If there is a reviewer who can give me a better idea, please do so.  If I can figure it out, I will give it an updated review.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting to read about how the SEALs took down Bin Laden and his organization.<br /><br />I know there is quite a bit controversy about this book, it did seem hastily written and just focused on getting the one story out. All in all it was a good read and very engaging, but just read like a punctuated recounting of one man's greatest hits (though I'm sure Mr. Owen has plenty more stories).<br /><br />Good to hear the &#34;real&#34; story about the Bin Laden raid, too bad it has probably cost this man the respect of his piers and will not get acknowledgement from the govt. powers that be.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is good, although I liked Hunger Games a bit better.  The Katniss/Peeta dynamic is a bit less solid (which may only be due to familiarity). It's still fast paced and an easy read.  All-in-all, it's quite good and well worth the read.

This actually came out way before I was born and I am so happy I was able to discover this album in it's full length. Everyone should purchase this beautiful album by Whitney Houston who it will never be another of.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|For those of you who have read Lost on a Mountain in Maine you'll find this novel equally as satisfying. Trish, 9-years-old-going-on-10-and-big-for-her-age, steps off the trail to pee and decides to take a short-cut back to her mother and brother. Of course she gets lost and, of course, something is tracking her. Something not so nice. This is Stephen King, right? The class read the Bottom of the 9th & Save Situation twice before we finished it. They loved it.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I have enjoyed most of the culture novels. Space opera at its best. The last three books have been ok though and I think this one was good. An extra effort though<br /> is needed to recapture the brilliance of Phlebas.

B0085RQLXK|4.0|Let's face it - we will never get another A+ Aerosmith album like \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Pump.\\"  The band is too fractured for that, and it's nothing short of a miracle that after years of failed attempts we saw a new album at all.  And with the possible exception of Rush, it's damn near impossible to find a band who makes music 40+ years into their career that ranks among their very best work.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" has a 45-minute album's worth of material that ranks from pretty good to quite good.  What does the remaining 25 minutes suffer from?  Overwrought balladry and Joe Perry's lead vocals.  And while much of the album rocks hard, there's also an unfortunate lack of big rock hooks, which is really what prevents this album from ranking among the band's best.  But this didn't need to be their best to still be pretty damn good.<br /><br />\\"LUV XXX\\" starts things off right.  It's pure sexy rock with a great groove and one of the album's better hooks, and would be a welcome set opener for the supporting tour.  It's likely no coincidence that the writing credits read simply \\"Tyler/Perry,\\" and one can only help wonder what kind of album this may have been if all songs carried similar credits.<br /><br />\\"Oh Yeah\\", penned solely by Joe Perry, continues the rock & roll party, and let's all thank Steven Tyler for insisting that he sing the lead vocals instead of Joe (more on that later).  On \\"Beautiful\\", it's evident that the band came to the table with the verses while an outside writer brought in the chorus, but it works.  And \\"Tell Me\\", penned entirely by bassist Tom Hamilton and carrying a noticeable Beatles influence, has the distinction of being one of the album's only enjoyable ballads.<br /><br />Over the next six tracks, we see the blend of near-greatness and mediocrity that modern-day Aerosmith has become known for.  \\"Out Go the Lights\\" and \\"Legendary Child\\" share not only a melody but also a sense of raw rock & roll fun, and rank astwo of the album's best tracks (sadly, the latter is an outtake from nearly 20 years ago).  \\"Street Jesus\\" and \\"Lover A Lot\\" are right up there, too, with the former serving as one of the band's most energetic blasts of rock boogie since the 70's.  But then we have \\"What Could Have Been Love\\", a largely outside-written melodramatic ballad that's basically a rewrite of \\"I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\" mixed with Jourey's \\"Open Arms\\", and \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\", a country-fied duet with Carrie Underwood.  The songs are practically interchangeable in their mediocrity, making you yearn for ballads that actually felt genuine (\\"What It Takes\\", \\"Cryin\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, the album never really recovers after this.  Ballads \\"We All Fall Down\\" and \\"Another Last Goodbye\\" should have been shelved or saved for other projects, while Joe Perry's rocking \\"Freedom Fighter\\" and psychedelic \\"Something\\" both suffer from his lead vocals.  Of the album's last five tracks, only the mid-tempo \\"Closer\\" (with a rare songwriting credit to drummer Joey Kramer) is worthy of inclusion on the album.  Oh, and deluxe-version bonus track \\"Sunny Side of Love\\" is much better than any of these songs.  Couldn't have one of the album's many producers fought for its inclusion?<br /><br />All its flaws considered, \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" is still a 3.5/5, B-grade album simply because there's enough good material to latch onto, especially for anyone who didn't want the lackluster \\"Just Push Play\\" or covers-only album \\"Honkin' On Bobo\\" to be known as the band's latest work.  Overall this is a step back up for the band and one worth checking out.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|Entertaining, somewhat goofy at times, unbelievable at times, really cool at times. Would not watch it again even if it was free.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was hard to put down, very intense relationships. I found myself staying up late to read.<br />I would read more books by this author.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|The movie is more bs than turkey bacon...<br /><br />It was more awkward than a family vacation to a nudist colony.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is an awesome game. There are multiple enemies, friends, and items to have and use. However, there aren't as much items to make or find unlike the PC version. If I'm wrong tell me please.
B0063M22QO|5.0|You can spend hours playing this game and for those who spend time alone it really helps keep your mind sharp!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|riodan has done it again. he never ceases to thrill shock and astound me with his complex and stimulating content. he has not dropped the ball of briliance in his book either. percy jackson and his demigod friends have started on their biggest most dangerous quest yet. i thought this was the last book in the heros of olympus searies but i was wrong. i wait with bated breath for the next book
B005Y423ZC|5.0|A fabulous performance from Adele who is so talented but very real and incredibly entertaining too.  Adele sounds as wonderful live as she does on disc.  To understand her music and her, this is a must to watch and you will treasure it amongst your collection of her work.  Brilliant performance and very good value too.
1439156816|5.0|This is one of the few books about writing that I found interesting enough to actually read. I am not surprised.
B009JNXK88|2.0|Control problems hold this back.<br />Which for a game that requires both speed and precision is fatal.<br />Pass this up unless they fix it up.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I like this game as well as others by team lava. It takes awhile to get things going but if you have neighbors giving gifts and playing with your dragons it helps out a lot!<br /><br />Edit 5/25/13:<br />This game used to be good, but now there are very few updates from team lava for the kindle fire. If you go the dragon story forums you will see updates for ios and android every week, but nothing for kindles. I would not recommend this game, it's a waste of time.
B00866H7SS|3.0|the story was good I was too busy enjoying the book I had not realize I was on the end of the book.<br />ending was not the way I expected it,like on fifty shades. If I were to compare I'd still choose fifty shades although this bared to you was more revealing than fifty.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It leaves you waiting for the next book, and wanting more.  How long until the next book is on the shelves?
B002N7P23I|1.0|I think the title says it all....if you want to watch the movie in English, then just rent the HORRIBLE American version \\"Quarantine\\".  This original Spanish film is very good, suspenseful, even heart-breaking at times, but in SPANISH...not dubbed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have so much respect for the Navy Seals and now for the Marines and Army.  Chris Kyle did a great job conveying all the work that our armed forces have done and are doing overseas.  So glad we have people like this on our side.
030759565X|5.0|I'm a longtime reader of the Smitten Kitchen blog, so I had high hopes for this cookbook.  I made the roasted chicken and potatoes last night- perfection!  I love roast chicken and always find something to gripe about with each recipe I try, but this worked beautifully. Time was right, technique was good, results were delish.<br />I read cookbooks like novels, and I love the thoughtful stories and intro notes for each recipe.  Deb is an incredible writer who is passionate about food, and it shines through.<br />I want to make every single recipe in this book.  Looking forward to many more successes!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Yes, This is my favorite  Android game.  I had not been introduced to nonograms previously.  The puzzles become more challenging, and it took me a long time to solve all the Shogun level puzzles.  Every now and then this game has been updated to add some new puzzles for free.  I have never had a problem with this game misbehaving.  The only thing I can think of which would be more helpful would be if I could somehow, for example by a snapshot or color, mark when I am following a possible, but not yet proven to me selection of boxes.  It would be helpful in solving the most difficult  puzzles. (Redo would also be nice.)  Until then, I guess I'll just have to use my brain.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|I am a long time Rush fan and a follower of progressive rock and metal.  I love the musical and tonal variety of Clockwork Angels.  Just wish some of the melodies and songs stuck with me.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Really strong release.  The softer and slower songs are probably my favorite - somewhat entrancing while staying utterly singable.  Recommended.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is a Dream Theater classic, especially for those of us who favor melodic prog rock.  Octavarium, the final track, is monumental with many call backs to Kansas, Styx and ELP.  And Panic Attack brings a pounding range that balances well between The Answer Lies Within and (one of my favorite DT songs) I Walk Beside You.
1432794426|5.0|Kudos to Dr. Moriarty, who has allowed MJ fans and non-fans alike to have an opportunity to know and understand and appreciate MJ as a true human being, rather than just as a celebrity. Through her research and her non-judgmental writing style, Dr. Moriarty presents us a book that has never been written on MJ before.<br /><br />A 500 page is a thick book, but it is full of thick, insightful observations that are thought provoking. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how MJ, as a matter fact, tried his very best to make our world a better place. Again, thank you Dr. Moriarty!
B007704HO6|5.0|I had read the report in the press and thought yes, must give that a try. What a wonderful story after all the doom and gloom in our World. It was one of the few stories that has brought genuine tears to my eyes after 60+ years of reading.......But, tears of pure joy. A must read for animal and people lovers everywhere.
B00428LIXO|3.0|It's a very stronge toy, not very educational and my son do have alot of fun with it, he just love hitting everything. The downfall I have with this product is that it don't hold his interest for a long time, it should have soft parts for teething babies and the handle is a bit fat for his little hands
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even a month after finishing these books I find myself still thinking about them, the people, the events.  I haven't read many stories that left such an impression
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  We like both British and Indian humor and found some parts funny especially when the visitors arrive in India.  It is a light-hearted movie and would give it 3.5-4 stars (mostly because I liked the scenes of India)
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This is a fun game, but this is a old version. The version on Google play is now up to 1.3.0, I wish that Amazon would keep up with the current versions. At the least, let us have access to the apps on other sites, so we can update to the current ones. Disappointed in Amazon for the first time..
B0013KTGAG|4.0|A couple years ago I heard a review on this movie.  Described as a well done sci-fi brainy thriller and a legit sleeper, we decided to give it a rent.  I now own the movie.  Great concept and execution if you ask me.  Who would have guessed that a sunburn could be so detrimental?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer, good read, pretty typical John Grisham but still very good. Lived up to the expectation that I have from this author.
1936608618|5.0|This book is a must read for any endurance athlete looking to train smarter, faster and stronger. I have been a strength and conditioning coach for over 20 years, am a Master Level Pose Coach and have seen more success in my athletes using MacKenzie's method of training than with any other program. The book provides everything you need for skill based training including nutrition, training guides and all of the pictures will ensure you do the movements correctly.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I put off reading this book due to many negative reviews and the characters being so much younger than myself but it was actually an entertaining read.<br />There were however many words (10) I had to look up on my Kindle dictionary (I read a lot and rarely need to look anything up). Not words pertaining to sex either! LOL I thought that was a little weird for a steamy novel but hey whatever.<br />I am reading book two and plan on reading the entire trilogy. Glad the girls at work talked me into reading it after all.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Have you ever seen anyone look at a cobra and think, I'm just gonna cuddle with it? Have you ever seen a deep sea diver decide, I'm going to take off the suit that ensures my head isn't crushed like an egg by the intense water pressure at the ocean floor?<br /><br />Though quite pretty at times, this movie was riddles with terrible writing and poor decisions. You know when someone in a horror movie says, \\"let's split up\\" that someone is going to die. This sort of writing is generally unacceptable, unless you're watching something like Scream 18 or Bride of Chucky. Those are movies where that level of lazy writing can be accepted under the fun of camp and too much blood. Some like it, some don't.<br /><br />This movie makes all those decisions without any of the camp. It might be better termed, \\"What happens when we let children who have been dropped on their head go into space.\\"<br /><br />I don't just want my money back. I want Riddley Scott to hand it to me himself with an apology for what he has done.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this on my kindle fire.  Good graphics, I like knowing how full or empty my battery is. I have never had any problems.

6305546797|5.0|The limited edition may be the way to go for Halloween. It's the cheapest way to get the extented tv version. Dare I say, it's the by far the best. Purist will complain, but the 12 additional minutes really set the tone for the film. If you love the original Halloween, GET THIS VERSION!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  Great way to keep those to do lists on the kindle.  Easy to use and convenient.
0385523912|5.0|I'm not even sure what to say to express how great this book is..if you are curious at all about North Korea this book is full of stories that will suck you in and make it hard to put the book down. I am a slow reader and read it in 24 hours. It is so unbelieveably sad to read about the craziness that occurs in North Korea, all at the hands of an evil regime. This book will stay with you and you won't forget it..Highly, highly recommend.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This season was even better than the 1st.  Each episode leaves you on the edge of your seat.  Great directing and costumes!
B001FA0W5W|3.0|Taleb's 'Fooled By Randomness' is nothing short of an awareness-raising collection of anecdotes, cautioning the dangers of overlooked randomness. Every chapter provides ample details to inform the reader of unforeseeable events - both good and bad.<br /><br />  Before I delve too deep into the review of this book, I feel it's important to know who the reader is. For instance, financial structures and markets are far from my comfort zone. I am not an overly-active reader with an obnoxiously expansive vocabulary. I am an engineering student (mediocre at best...) who decided to read this book in order to gain an understanding of how randomness intertwines with the market. If you are someone of great intelligence in regards to stocks and the markets, this review is probably going to be irrelevant to you. Otherwise, this review is written from the standpoint of an average guy.<br /><br />  The first thing to know before reading this novel is the structure of the book itself. There are fourteen chapters in which Taleb does a good job hammering the point home - borderline beating a dead horse. The chapters themselves are well-written but seem to have no particular order to the book as a whole. For instance, if you were to read the book backwards (chapter 14 on down), I don't think you would ever noticed you were reading it in reverse - though the overall point and theme would have been received just as well. I'm not sure if that's a sign of an incredibly well-written book or a unorganized collection of thoughts and stories. Also, Taleb has a tendency to use 13 words to describe a 2 word event. Albeit very descriptive, every sentence could probably be reduced by half. Taleb is clearly the intellectually superior between he and I, for I have to look up every third word he writes.<br /><br />  Initially, this book grabbed my attention. All of the facts were interesting and really got me thinking about the role randomness not only in the markets, but in our everyday lives.<br/>The opening chapters compared two brokers with two different personal as well as professional approaches towards life. One being high-risk and high-reward while the other was conservative and consistent. My emotional side liked the high-risk trader, while my logical side related to the conservative trader. After all, Hollywood has done such a good job painting such a skewed perception of high-risk traders. We often see the rewards people (actors) reap after risking almost everything - high stakes, high adrenaline, last minute decisions - but it all pays off in the end, right? Wrong. Hollywood doesn't show the aftermath of the  99.5% of those people who lose. Thus, my logical side relating to the conservative trader. Taleb creates some of the best analogies I have ever read. As a matter of fact, if it weren't for his analogies, I probably wouldn't understand the book. Once again, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing...<br /><br />  The most important concept that I took from this book was the notion of Survivorship Bias. We all have it (most to a large extent), yet we hardly ever acknowledge it. In a nutshell (and without spoiling any of his original details/theories), survivor bias is the thought process of `oh that will never happen to me'. It's the notion that we are exempt from certain undesirable outcomes. When buying a lottery ticket, we all envision the most rewarding although lease likely outcome - winning big. In reality, it's quite the opposite. Taleb references this often unaccounted-for bias quite often - each time making the stakes a little more interesting. Second behind survivorship bias, I thought his perception of induction was also informative. We, as humans, tend to induce information that can't be induced. Some systems would rather have wrong data than no data at all - this is a very dangerous method. Some information is just not meant to be induced.<br /><br />  Taleb spends a good amount of time (about two and a half chapters) criticizing other wealthy people. He likes to use his Monte Carlo simulator analogy a lot, and with that, he starts to pick apart other people's wealth. If we were to run the course of the people's lives one million times, what are the chances they would still be millionaires? For most of them, the number would be minute. Although I understand his point, I can't help but to notice an undertone of envy and/or anger towards these `lucky' few.<br /><br />  All of these stories convey one message: randomness can - and will (more often than not) - appear when it is least convenience. It is always important try to acknowledge obscure events, or at least leave room for error in their cause. In one section of the book, Taleb informs us everything is subject to randomness - including evolution. According to Taleb, there are 6 characteristics that make a person a fool to randomness:<br />1. An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs<br />2. A tendency to get married to positions<br />3. The tendency to change their story<br />4. No precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in negative events<br />5. Absence of critical thinking<br />6. Denial<br />In chapter 5, he explains his reasoning for each of these traits and why they make one a fool to randomness. I agree with his reasoning and in my opinion, most of these traits make a person a fool in general...<br /><br />  In conclusion, Taleb does a  great job informing the reader on just how much randomness is actually in our lives. We should always try to recognize that randomness attributes mostly to success. Most people spend a lifetime trying to be successful, when in reality, we need to spend that time trying to minimize the variability of the outcomes of our situations. We should also try to analyze most important decision logically as opposed to emotionally. We need to set goals and not pay attention to the surrounding `noise'. As Taleb says, remember that your personal behavior is the only thing randomness can't control.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Our boys love it.  We have serveral of the angry birds video games and they love all of them.  Price was good too.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I have no idea what the writer was thinking. One of the silliest, most stupid premises for a movie that I have seen. I guess I am old school, but to sully the memory of one of our greatest presidents in this inane movie is an insult to American history. Just plain awful!!!!!!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I think it is important to say up front that I am 42 years old and have never been a huge Rolling Stones fan.  Sure, I've liked some of their music in passing but that was about it.  I don't think I've ever purchased a Stones album before and I've never really sat down and listened to hours of Stones music in a sitting until I got a pre-release version of this set and decided to give them a try.  So, this is a review from a casual / new Rolling Stones fan.  I see some reviewers here are already complaining about some songs being edited and how the remasters were done, for me I don't have enough Stones chops to notice any of that.  For better or for worse, I'm basically reviewing this as a Stones virgin.<br /><br />With all of that said I liked this set, more than I thought I would.  The 50 tracks take the Stones from their very beginning through today and I think the audio quality on the tracks all sound amazing.  I would have to guess that I had heard, and was pretty familiar with, about 30 of these tracks before I listened to this set, which is truly amazing from just hearing the band on radio.  These guys have truly pumped out some great music over the years and I'm wondering if feeling like I was more in the Beatles camp over the Stones had kept me from enjoying some pretty good tracks.<br /><br />As someone who does now own any other Stones material I have to say that this is a perfect primer for fans like me.  I'm sure some of the older fans will complain that it is just another repackage job, and that may be a fair argument until you realize that you're probably not the people they're looking to sell this to.  Buy the two new tracks on iTunes or here on Amazon and be happy.  For me, this set really has opened my eyes and taken my respect for the Rolling Stones up a notch.  It really is amazing that the sound, and Mick's voice, have kept up so well over the years.  The latest Aerosmith record showed Steven Tyler's voice showing it's age, but here Mick seems pretty much ageless.<br /><br />I am not sure exactly how the track listing was picked here, but I think it pulls a good assortment of music from the Stones catalog, I'm sure it's missing some tracks people think should be here and maybe that's true.  For me, as a new convert, I'm pretty sure I'll be going back through the old catalog to find out what else I've been missing out on.  So for the longtime fans that get aggravated with constant repackaging and ask why the labels do it, the answer is two-fold.  The first, and obvious, answer is to pull as much profit as they can out of a band.  The second, and one that applies to me, is to get new people interested in the music.<br /><br />The bottom line for me here is if you're like me and have just enjoyed a Rolling Stones song from time to time on the radio this is the set for you.  My only caution is, like me, you may realize you've been missing out on some great music and now be opening your wallet to start going through a back catalog that is extensive!  I just looked it up on Wikipedia and it says the Stones catalog \\"consists of 29 studio albums, 17 live albums, 30 compilation albums.\\"  So much music and so little time!etty much ageless.<br /><br />I am not sure exactly how the track listing was picked here, but I think it pulls a good assortment of music from the Stones catalog, I'm sure it's missing some tracks people think should be here and maybe that's true.

B009AJDDQU|3.0|The special effects were wonderful and Fassbender was excellent as David, but the new protagonist is nowhere near  \\"Ripley\\". The Alien franchise is one of my favorite series and I will continue with this prequel, but the magic of Sigourney Weaver as the heroine has no competition from 'Prometheus'
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|It is a bit amazing to me that this CPU has only dropped $3 in price since I purchased it in 11 months ago.  It probably shouldn't surprise me though as it is still one of the best and fastest CPUs on the market.  It is rated for 3.4Ghz and I've been running it overclocked at 4.2Ghz without a problem.  Just make sure you get a good cooling fan!<br /><br />One note and something I originally missed, Intel has two models the i7-2600 and this one the i7-2600K.  The K is vital if you want to overclock as the non-K units are locked down and won't let you play around with the speeds.  Make sure you get the \\"K\\" version if you want to push the CPU to its limits and get the most speed that you can!<br /><br />The bottom line is I love this CPU, it's fast, the cost is reasonable and it has been rock solid stable even overclocked.  Love it!
B006ZNRD06|1.0|You cant film anything you can only watch stuff! it might be me but DONT DOWNLOAD THIS STUPID APP. worst app ever.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|I had a hard time with this book - not because it wasn't another beautiful piece of work by a brilliant author, but because it felt almost voyeuristic to have such a front row seat to his inevitable decline into the foggy, cancer-ridden entries at the end.  It's an intimate and honest portrayal of death and dying from an author that was taken far too soon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the computer version and MINECRAFT is my favorite computer game. I played this before but when l got it on my kindle it was better than on the phone (Because it was updated). The only part that I hate is that you have to pay again to update (I might be missing somthing though). MOJANG IS THE BEST! #1GAME! l'm going to be waiting for Mojangs next game!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Perfect for all Star Wars and Angry Birds fans! It is expensive but worth it! I recommend this game to everyone!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed the kitchen house very much. Sometimes all the different names of so many charecters got a bit confusing. It is a good read and an interesting time in our history. Pick it up! Janet B.
0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and I can't wait for the third! If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey then I think you will love this too. I really liked both, independently, and I don't really think you can compare the two... or atleast I don't like to compare them. I for sure liked the way it was written, in everday language that was easy to understand and straight to the point. Totally check it out!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG! Can't put it down :) It's deliciously naughty Not for everyone maybe!The story is well written and the characters are awesome
B000MQPKVG|4.0|knowing that he later made 2001 and Clockwork Orange, it is fascinating to see this sumptuous period movie by Kubrick.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Could give you more gold but I love it . Shouldn't be Internet based but w.e & it should be easier to connect to friends
B006JJBFK0|5.0|As an avid Gothic/Symphonic metal fan who's favorites include Nightwish, Leaves Eyes and Lacuna Coil, I must say I am extremely impressed with this album.  The sound is Heavy yet deep with symphonic elements; it makes me think of the instrumentally heavier songs of Nightwish's \\"Dark Passion Play,\\" but with vocal power to rival Tarja's.  If you area fan of old Nightwish, such as Oceanborn, or Century Child, then this album will get you very excited.<br /><br />If Xandria continues to make music such as this, they will dominate this genre with ease: they have all the proper elements in place, they just need to stay creative and passionate.  I will be watching them very excitedly.<br /><br />All of the other five star reviews on this album are spot on: Wonderful music!
0375413405|4.0|This is the book for you!  LOL - an excellent cookbook - the recipes are laid out in a different (than most of us are used to) way, but very workable.  There are some lovely meals waiting to be made in here!!

B007L6VR12|5.0|So i bought this DVD, without even seeing the movie, only the trailer. I saw that 96% of critics loved the movie, so i just had to get it.( i also heard from friends that it was good). Let me tell you, i watched this with my mom, and dad who i convinced to wacth cause bill murray, bruce willis, and Edward Norton were in it. At first they thought it was a strange movie, but i thought it was amazing. Well done, and worth the $15. This is one of the best movies i have ever seen. The music is well done in the movie, and the actors are perfect. I will be watching this movie for years to come, and would highly reccomend it to any movie or film lover. It has some really funny moments, and ever scene is well done. GO BUY!
098478280X|5.0|Excellent book. Provides a review of basic programming practices.<br /><br />None of the questions I was asked in the interview were verbatim from the book, but the concepts and ideas I learned from this book helped me offer better solution.

B007TK77QE|1.0|A big disapointment. So negative.  Not one single thread of positiveness or cheerfulness..<br />I brought this book, cause her other books were excelent.  Irrespective that Harry Potter were a fairytale, and this book for &#34;grown-ups&#34;.  This book just leave you down in the dumps. Morbid....  A pitty, cause JK Rowling is an excellent writer....

B009AZZEU2|5.0|WOW...welcome back, boys!<br /><br />If ever there was an album worth waiting sixteen grueling years for, it would be this one. King Animal is SO much more than what I expected it to be. I was prepared for an average album, even a letdown, given the understandably tremendous hype. However, I'm happy to report that Soundgarden is back in the biggest possible way. This is no publicity stunt, they truly sound reborn!<br /><br />I'll even go out on a limb and say this is their best collection of songs yet. There's plenty here that will have 90's era fans spellbound. \\"By Crooked Steps\\" is vintage Soundgarden, a riff-driven rocker with soaring vocals and eerie guitar effects. \\"Taree\\", written before the band's 1997 breakup, is a catchy, haunting dirge. \\"Black Saturday\\" sounds like it could have easily been on Down on the Upside. And \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" harkens back to Badmotorfinger.<br /><br />But for me, there are two songs that truly transcend anything they've ever done, \\"Bones of Birds\\" and \\"Rowing\\". The former is, by far, the most chillingly wistful tune I've ever heard, while the latter is a stunning slow burner with a KILLER bass line that builds and builds, with some very touching lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Rowing is living and living is hard<br />but living beats losing all that we are<br />and all that we know of and all that we feel<br />and all we remember, imagined or real\\"<br /><br />That part sent shivers down my spine...<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm (obviously) more than impressed with this release, and not because I want to like it. This is very powerful music, capable of getting the emotions stirring, and we should be grateful that the band remains focused and committed to perfecting their craft. I hope that SG fans, old and new, will enjoy this fine effort as much as I have.<br /><br />Thank you, Soundgarden. It's great to have you back.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|I never got why anyone liked Stewart in the Twilight movies. I never thought she was anything more than average looking and never saw any acting from her that Jane Doe couldn't do.<br />My daughter pestered me to see this movie, so one saturday when my wife was gone visiting her sister I made popcorn and sat down to watch this movie with my 10 year old baby girl.<br />It was a decent adventure for awhile as Chris Hemsworth fronted the first half of the movie and Stewart kept her mouth shut.<br />But then, she began to try and act.<br />Kristen Stewart was horrible giving her little \\"we have to fight\\" speech. Granted, the writers were as much at fault for that dialogue, but in my opinion, she just cannot act. I picture her trying to do Shakespear and cringe.<br />I thought my daughter wanted to see the movie because she was a Stewart fan, but it turned out it was Chris Hemsworth she was into. We had a good laugh over that.<br />It was a pity that Charleze Theron played the role as the evil queen. I didn't like her character, but she, at least, CAN act. And she's far better looking than Stewart.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|The difference between this man compared to say Neyo, Bruno Mars or Usher...he goes where the others are afraid to. He sings about what's exactly on his mind in a poetically crude and unapologetic way. If you or I spoke the lyrics to a woman, she'd probably walk off, but coming from Abel? Audio aphrodisiac. This man is a genius.<br /><br />I was skeptical at first since I already had all his previous mixtapes which make up the majority of \\"Trilogy\\". Sure it's remastered but how much better can it be?...turns out...significantly better. Don't get me wrong, the original recordings will always have it's underground grittiness that I love, kinda like vinyl vs cd, but in the remastered version reveals sounds and textures not previously experienced both in the music and in Abel's vocals. There are also some extras thrown in here and there. The new tracks are pure gold and are akin closer to the style of \\"House of Balloons\\" and \\"Thursday\\"<br /><br />If you are a fan of The Weeknd, you will love his first official album. If you are not yet familiar with his work, get this album..you won't be disappointed.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As a child of the 50's, my dad served in this time period.  I found the stories a fascinating interlocking puzzle.  I had forgotten about the Berlin Airlift.  I knew about the Russians and their brutality.  War is a nasty business. I am now waiting for the next book!
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|What a fantastic read. I couldn't put this one down. Some interesting concepts from a brilliant writer, and so many of the quotes from this book have made their way into my diary to remind me of the things that matter most in life e.g: \\"It is never to late or to soon, it is when it is supposed to be\\",\\" with endless time nothing is special, with no loss or sacrifice we can't appreciate what we have\\" and  \\"There is a reason God limited our days, why ? to make each one precious\\".<br />I highly recommend this book to all ages. It is simply brillant.

B004DL5K2K|5.0|Blizzard of Ozz is the first solo album by Ozzy Osbourne. It was originally released in 1980. This reissue came out in the Spring of 2011.<br /><br />When Ozzy left Black Sabbath (or was fired, depends on who you ask), he was unsure if he was going to continue on musicially. Fortunately, he made the decision to keep going, and it is a choice that has proven to be the right one on more than a few occasions. For his first solo album, Ozzy put together a band that included guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads (former Quiet Riot), Lee Kerslake (former Uriah Heep), Bob Daisley (former Rainbow), and Don Airey (a guy who has played keyboards with damn near everybody.)<br /><br />The Blizzard of Ozz album hit stores in the UK in late 1980, and it would arrive in American stores early the following year. Sales figures were impressive, and the album was subjected to a variety of positive reviews, although Ozzy was not without his share of detractors. The album has a spotty re-issue history over the years, including at least one release that had re-recorded drum and bass tracks! But, how does the album itself hold up all these years later?<br /><br />Put simply, Blizzard of Ozz is one of the masterpieces of the heavy metal genre. Ozzy came out of nowhere following his parting ways with Black Sabbath, and released a classic for the ages. The track on here everyone knows is Crazy Train, which has become one of the most popular metal songs of all time. Many other hits appear here, including stuff like I Don't Know and Mr. Crowley. Underrated masterpieces galore also grace this album, ranging from soft ballads and melodic material to straight-up rockers. It is very rare that an album doesn't have a single weak track, but Blizzard is one of those records. The true star of this show is guitar legend Randy Rhoads, who had his life cut short in a plane crash at age 25, not long after releasing 2 records with Ozzy.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, chances are you are already familiarwith how great the album is, and you may even already own a copy. This reissue is definitely worth investing in, even if you already bought one of the earlier CD reissues. This restores all of the original recordings, so there is no re-recorded junk or anything like that. Sound quality is the best of any release of the album so far, and I definitely noticed some little subtleties in the mix that were brought out in this version I did not notice on my older release. Additionally, there are 3 bonus tracks - a non-album B-side, a remixed version of Goodbye to Romance, and a guitar solo from Randy Rhoads. It's a great album to begin with, but these bonuses are the icing on the cake. If I have one complaint, it's that there is a lot of stuff from this era (bootlegs, live recordings, even a few unreleased tracks) that was not included here as bonus material. Still, I can't complain too much.<br /><br />All in all, this is the best release to date of one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Even if you already bought it in some shape or form over the years, this is the release to own. Best sound quality on any version so far, and the remastered sound quality is superior to any earlier CD release. Bonus tracks only sweeten the deal. Needless to say, this reissue comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0385535139|5.0|Again this is a hit!  I would definitely recommend it to Grisham readers.  Can't wait for another new one to come out.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|Beyond Magnetic is an EP from Metallica. It was released in late 2011.<br /><br />Over the years Metallica has been the quintessential heavy metal band, and one of the most famous worldwide. In the 80s, they were the kings of thrash. In the 90s and early 2000s, they experimented with alternative rock and nu-metal sounds, much to the dismay of many fans. Finally, 2008's studio release, Death Magnetic, brought the band back to its classic sound, and won back many an estranged fan.<br /><br />When Metallica makes an album, they go all out with the recording process, and needless to say, many tracks don't make the final cut of an album (did you know that much of Re-Load was just leftover tracks from the Load sessions?) Such was the case with Death Magnetic. This EP features 4 tracks from the sessions that didn't make it on to the final record, in a relatively raw, unmixed state.<br /><br />I think it is safe to say that, if you were a fan of the Death Magnetic record (and it looks like most of the band's long-time fans were), you're going to be in for a real treat with these tracks. You get 4 great, hard-rocking thrash tunes that, sadly, didn't quite make the final cut of the Death Magnetic album, Despite it, these are by no means \\"throwaway\\" tracks. Whether they top any cuts that made the final album is open to interpretation, though I doubt any fan will be disappointed in them.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it is that this EP seems like something of a wasted opportunity. The band should have included the 2 non-album tracks recorded around the same time as Death Magnetic - Remember Tomorrow (Iron Maiden cover) and 53rd and 3rd (Ramones cover), since you can't get these on a Metallica release of any kind. As is, this is a great EP with some awesome tunes on it. But if they had thrown those two songs on, it would have been perfect.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning, that despite these tracks being fairly raw and unmixed, the sound quality and production of thetracks on here is still solid. I don't think any fan will be complaining about audio quality.<br /><br />All things considered, it's a few measly bucks for 4 of the best Metallica songs in years. I think that is a small price to pay to get the awful taste of Lulu out of your mouth. I wish they had included Remember Tomorrow and 53rd and 3rd, but those omissions shouldn't deter you. Beyond Magnetic is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|So many people say so many stupid things about this band. But this box set is filled with love and put together with love, and if you don't get that, you never really \\"got\\" the Beatles.
B006UG90RM|4.0|A Different Kind of Truth is the twelfth studio album from Van Halen. It is their first album since 1984 to feature David Lee Roth on vocals, and their first recordings to feature bassist Wolfgang Van Halen (Eddie's son.)<br /><br />For the course of the last year, rumors have been spreading like wildfire regarding the \\"new Van Halen album.\\" It has been a long an interesting year, full of anticipation and a number of judgments based on the few songs that had been released prior to the record itself. The actual album was finally released in February of 2012.<br /><br />Many of the early reports were of doubt, which seemed to be largely (and for no good reason) fueled by reports that the songs the band was putting together for the new record were re-recorded demos from the band's earliest days, prior to the release of their self-titled 1978 debut. Even I was doubtful about how this record would turn out after hearing Tattoo, the first released track from the then-forthcoming album.<br /><br />Let me say, right from the get-go, people are making the huge mistake of comparing this album to the band's first two albums. Nothing compares to those, and that is a foolish thing to do. The album fits in better with the latter few Roth albums, and should be evaluated on its own merits - not because it \\"isn't as good as the debut.\\" Seriously, what IS!?<br /><br />If anyone lacked optimism about this new release, it was me. But after giving it a few listens, I came to a conclusion I was not expecting to come to - this is actually a pretty damn good album! The material here easily slays any non-Roth Van Halen album, or any Roth solo album. It is not necessarily an \\"instant classic\\" or anything like that, but there are some great tunes on here. This is the best Eddie Van Halen has played since the glory days of the band. And, of course, Roth gets plenty of chances to show off that classic sense of humor. It is tough to describe the overall sound of the record, as it falls somewherebetween the straight-up rock of the first two albums and the ultra-glossy overproduced 1984. The record is not quite a happy medium, but what they they have done here works. It might take a few listens for the record to grow on you - so don't be quick to judge it after your first listen.<br /><br />I for one am tired of seeing people bash the current version of the band for no good reason. So what if some of these songs are re-worked/re-recorded demos? I don't care, the music kicks ass! And what is the deal with people bashing Wolfgang and wanting Michael Anthony back? I miss Mr. Anthony as much as the next guy (particularly his backing vocals), but this record is great on its own merits, and Wolfgang is a fantastic bassist who stands on his own.<br /><br />Overall, my doubts have been shattered, and if you give this record a chance, yours will too. Van Halen has released what is their strongest album in nearly three decades. And needless to say, it comes STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

B0085RQLXK|3.0|Music from Another Dimension. Aerosmith's 15th studio album.<br /><br />Aerosmith has had a long and interesting odyssey through the world of rock and roll. Even with their 70s heyday long behind them, the group has managed to remain relevant, and still tours and remains a fan favorite worldwide.<br /><br />Music from Another Dimension is an album that has been very eagerly awaited by many a fan, largely because the album is the band's first in 8 years (and their first album of all original material in 11 years.) Only further adding to the eagerness is the participation of Jack Douglas, the producer who was responsible for the band's classic 70s sound (he had also participated in the sessions for the band's most recent album, 2004's Honkin' on Bobo.)<br /><br />But if you're reading this review, there is only one question on your mind. Is this new release from Aerosmith actually any good?<br /><br />Yes and no.<br /><br />Firstly, the good. There are plenty of upbeat, funky rockers on this album that would have been right at home on the band's late 80s/90s albums. Steven Tyler and the boys keep that sound alive, and surprisingly, they still sound great, full of energy on every track. When this album is at its best, it is quite possibly the best the band has sounded since the 80s. Tracks like Street Jesus and Oh Yeah are instant favorites. Legendary Child, the single/radio hit released from the record that has been getting radio airplay for the past few months, is a great tune as well. Guitarist Joe Perry even gets to try his hands at lead vocals on a few tracks, and surprisingly, these actually ended up being a few of my favorite songs on the record!<br /><br />But sadly, the album is far from perfect. The biggest flaw is the one you have already read in everyone else's reviews - There are TOO MANY BALLADS. Not only that, but most of the ballads feel like second-rate clones of I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing, the Trevor Rabin composition they did for the Armageddon soundtrack back in the 90s. The album itself is FAR TOO LONG (non-expanded editions clock in at around 70 minutes), the band would have been better off relegating at least 4 songs to B-side status. And while we're at it, did we seriously need a duet with Carrie Underwood?<br /><br />And there you have it. When this album is at its rocking best, it is tough to beat. When it descends into ballad territory, it becomes predictable and stale. This coupled with an overlong run time cripples a release people had high hopes for. With Jack Douglas on board, I think we were hoping for something that sounded like a lost 70s Aerosmith record. Instead, we get something that sounds like a lost 90s Aerosmith record - and you wouldn't even know Douglas produced it unless someone told you otherwise.<br /><br />Final Verdict: For die-hard Aerosmith fans only. 3/5 stars
B0094BB4TW|1.0|so I log on to Facebook and someone that I did not care for in high school had a picture of us together, being tagged in that photo made it seem like I was that douche's friend , Facebook is stupid I hate the association to friendships and I stop using it,
B005MW8CLK|4.0|Gish is the first album by the Smashing Pumpkins. It was originally released in 1991.<br /><br />The Smashing Pumpkins quickly won over audiences in the 1990s with an alternative rock sound all their own. Billy Corgan and his bandmates created something unique that remains loved and widely listened to. I have no reservations in saying that, of all the various alternative band that surfaced in the 90s, the Smashing Pumpkins were the most unique out of the lot.<br /><br />The band formed in the late 80s and was together until around 2000, releasing a number of albums, featuring no shortage of great tracks. Their greatest success came with the release of their 1995 album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Much of the band's early work, however, remains overshadowed by the success of that classic record. 2011 saw the reissue of the first two albums in the band's catalogue, 1991's Gish and 1993's Siamese Dream.<br /><br />Revisiting Gish two decades after its original release, how does it measure up? To put it simply, Gish is a very good record, and even spawned some early hits for the group in the form of Siva and Rhinoceros. However, it is clear in this early period, the band had yet to really decide on what kind of sound they would pursue and make their own. As a result, the album is a bit on the uneven side and lacks the focus and expertise of their later records. As such, we get a little bit of everything on this record - indie-flavored rock, psychedelia, melodic ballads, straight-up rockers, the list goes on. Some of the tracks tend to drag on too long, and on some it really isn't clear what the band was trying to do. Yet, I still really enjoy this album. It isn't the best album in the Smashing Pumpkins catalogue, but fans will still want to pick it up.<br /><br />There are two CD reissues of the album. Sadly, there is no \\"compromise\\" amongst them. The single-disc version is fairly inexpensive but includes no bonus tracks. The \\"deluxe\\" reissue has a ton of rare bonus tracks, including demos, remixes, unreleased tracks, live tracks, Peel sessions, and everything in between. It even includes a DVD of a vintage performance from the Gish period. This is what angers me, however. At $25 on average in stores I have been to, the release is too expensive. I don't see why the record company could not release a 2CD version sans the DVD, as the bonus material on there is pretty good. Die-hard Smashing Pumpkins fans will probably shell out the cash regardless, for the sake of the DVD and bonus material disc.<br /><br />All in all, this is a solid reissue of a great debut album from one of the 90s most talented bands. This reissued deluxe edition is overpriced, however the bonus content and remastered sound makes it worth investing in if you are a big-time Pumpkins fan. Strongly recommended!

B002NZTZ8S|2.0|I recently purchased The Polar Express... again. The plot is cloying, the central theme revolving around cardboard characters. The backgrounds are exquisite. The faces of the characters are likely frightening to younger children and are extremely off-putting, in particular, the character of the main female lead. Plot points are made with a sledge hammer... repeatedly, but as my wife said, for little kids, that might be appropriate. But some of the scenes would probably frighten little kids.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I like Tom Hanks, I like Christmas and I like Christmas movies. This one though seems geared to getting Christmas presents, characters are introduced and leave. The subplot labored, all in all, unless you are a fan of commercial Christmas, I would suggest giving this a wide berth.

1439127700|4.0|This is an interesting account on the relationships (or lack of) between the incoming and the outgoing President since Truman, including many times the influence and active participation of the living ex-Presidents. While written in a catchy style, the reader will need some knowledge about US politics and history to fully grasp the detailed analysis presented, otherwise you might end up just getting the \\"current President ask the previous one for advice\\" message (as another reviewer pointed out). The history buff will be delighted to read how such world-shaping events like the Cuban missile crisis developed within the White House, but then again will wait in vain to hear a detailed analysis on the JFK assassination.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-researched and important piece of US history that deserved to be told in this manner - recommended.

B004S9AK3G|5.0|A wonderful sequel to Pillars Of the Earth, this second book World Without End shines a light on the living conditions of the 11th Century. The Catholic Church hierarchy sounds pretty similar to what we hear about the Vatican today in the 21st century; many priests who do help/care about their fellow man and many who are only interested in their own schemes, disguised under that umbrella \\"it is God's will\\". We forget how many millions died of the Black Death plague, England lost almost HALF of its population during the several outbreaks. Am I right in thinking that Merthin was one of the carriers of the plague from Europe. Also thank you Mr Follett for the meaning of quarantine.<br />Historically, I found this book extremely interesting, esp. the hidden letter at the end revealing what may have happened to Henry II. I am not a builder but found the details of cathedral construction interesting, how the stone arches are constructed and the octagonal spire, thanks to the Italians and French already using those techniques in their own countries.<br />I highly recommend this book for school students, it will bring their history lessons alive but also to the general reader; could not put it down.

She sets out to build her own destiny.<br /><br />It also highlights the problems facing many teens & mothers in a fantasy way. Great for any child or mom.<br /><br />She is the first noble born Princess in Disney to wield a weapon. She is also the first to NOT have a love story. I love how they not only designed the character, but also how her personality and story comes alive.<br /><br />Although not the BEST Disney movie I've seen, its pretty close. I felt it was both cute, funny, and heartwarming at times. The darkness our heroine faces is of her own doing, which is also different from most Disney movies.<br /><br />Im sure any Disney lover will find this enjoyable.
0312641893|4.0|I enjoyed this new look into the future, I especially liked the cyborg twist made into this 'Cinderella' novel. It was slightly predictable, but it still worked very well for me.<br /><br />One thing that I just have to mention, is that I kind of hope she doesn't end up with Kai. She deserves even better, and he has proven himself weak in my eyes. I heard something about a street fighter in the next book. Very promising.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|There were parts of the novel that did not seem to be the \\"Original\\" Reacher. I wondered at times if Mr. Child had \\"help\\" in parts of the book.

B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Brilliant book. Good from start to finish. Would recommend to anyone that likes romance and the paranormal. A book to get lost in. I love the whole series
B007J7LFTW|5.0|Excellent album.<br />Not that \\"Thick as a Brick\\" needed a sequel but, since Ian decided to do one, he really delivered it.<br />Prog fans: I highly recommend it!
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I bought this toy for my 6  year old daughter's birthday after introducing her to the Gremlins movie. She fell in love and continuous wished she had a \\"Mogwai.\\" It's cute, makes the cute noise from the movie, and she plays with it occasionally. She loved it the minute she opened it. So far, so good.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Unfortunately this book was formulaic, somewhat choppy, and too much of the same thing we got in the last few books. I'm a Scarpetta fan but she has started to be too insecure and indecisive-not her trademarks.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|I think that Lotus, is really a fun cd and have some good songs.<br /><br />The duets with Blake Shelton and Celo are great. Like alaways happens, there's a few songs that I wont listen in a while.<br /><br />But songs like, Just a fool, Circles, Your Body, Blank Page, Army of me, Best of me, are the Christina we use to know.<br /><br />The only problem is that I was expecting that this album was a truly explicit \\"album\\", but when you listen to \\"Your body\\" and \\"Shut up\\", there's nothing explicit and it supposed to be, which I dont understand, cause \\"Circles\\" is really unrated, so I dont get the deal.<br /><br />That's why i gave a 4 stars.
0307887448|1.0|Ready Player One takes place on Earth in the near future (around 2040) when the planet is in steep environmental decline.  Hunger now plagues a majority of the population, and homelessness and crime are rife.  In order to cope with the drudgery of their existence, most people on the planet spent a majority of their free time in a virtual reality called the Oasis.  The Oasis is basically a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMO) with the \\"game\\" part being optional, as people can also shop in the Oasis and spend time with friends there.<br /><br />The novel begins with the death of one of the richest people on the planet and the creator of the Oasis, James Halliday; a man who had become a living legend for his creation.  Halliday, a socially awkward genius who became reclusive towards the end of his life, leaves behind a will that bequeaths all of his possessions, worth billions, to the winner of a contest he created within the Oasis.  The contest requires an encyclopedic knowledge of 1980s pop culture and of Halliday's personal obsessions with that decade in particular.<br /><br />Thousands of people take on the challenge, ultimately spending years studying the source material.  After five years, the contest has not been won, and here begins the plot - a first person narrative of the winner of the contest describing how he won and some of the important people he met along the way.  Throughout the book, Halliday is described with reverence, his every minor interest explored, his favorite arcade games mastered by thousands.<br /><br />My issue with the novel is this: in a world on the brink of collapse where poverty has become the norm, a man who creates a distraction from this hell is elevated to god-like status.  Thousands of very intelligent people spend years of the their lives studying pop culture in order to win the contest he created.  And Cline presents this with no sense of irony or cynicism, no critique of the forces that have driven the planet to these extremes, no mention of any work done by anyone to change things.  No, Cline instead glorifies these untold thousands who devote their lives to winning a contest worth a lot of money.  The only character who shows any awareness or concern about the state of the planet expresses her desire to spend the winnings to feed the hungry - not to address the problems that have created world wide poverty and environmental devastation.  Her desire is so underdeveloped as to relegate her to the status of a little girl who wants to save homeless puppies.<br /><br />Cline presents hundreds of pages of minutiae relating to the 1980s, casting an approving eye on those who spend their lives lost in a game.  The result is a book - not just the world he creates - that is morally and emotionally bankrupt.  For those like Cline who share an obsession with the pop culture of the eighties, the book has a lot of entertainment to offer.  But for those who want more than to reminisce on the good ol' days, for readers who delve into dystopian fiction to explore how people might struggle to survive in a bleak future, the book has nothing to offer.
B0070XB0N6|5.0|Sat down with the intent of reading by myself. My boys got interested and have been fans of Neil Gaiman ever since.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am always excited when Grisham gets back to legal thrillers.  Other books are ok, but his legal thrillers are really special.  Munchkin
1451627297|5.0|It was a real treat to read about a period of \\"history\\" that I actually lived through as a teenager and remember.  Stephen King is such an amazing storyteller that I never wanted to put the book (kindle) down.  I don't think any other writer could have made me interested in the lives and choices of Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife, and I was fascinated by their (King's) stories.<br />The concurrent experiences of the first person \\"writer/time traveler\\" made the book much more interesting than a simple history of Lee and Marina Oswald would have been. King also did a great job of weaving the \\"culture\\" of Dallas in the early 60's into the stories, especially for an Easterner (like me) who's never been to Texas.<br />11/22/63 was so good that I made an effort to read it more slowly when I realized that I was more than three quarters of the way through it.  I didn't want my enjoyment of the great story to end!<br />I highly recommend this book.
B003F0VM6I|5.0|i heard a song from this album from a friend and just had to have it.i think its a must for metal  fans.this was ahead of its time for the year it was produced.
B004U52VPS|3.0|it is hard to put everything back to the box, if you loose track of how the pieces came originally in the box, and normally you will never now because your kid already opened :)
B00A17AD36|5.0|I rarely buy full albums, but I bought this one even after having all these mp3s for free.  That is a testament to how excellent this collection is.  It's so rare to find something that's so well put together and where all the parts put together have such high quality.<br /><br />All these albums have a very specific mood and tie so well to the other albums.  Each song flows into each other song in a seamless way.  They were designed to be played together...they were designed to be played in the order they're set up.  And not as an afterthought of \\"Well...let's put this one here...and this one there...\\" No.  I've been a huge fan of R&B all my life and this is a masterpiece to me.<br /><br />This is up there with Aaliyah's self-titled and Maxwell's Embrya.  It makes you feel subdued the whole time...taken.  I would venture to say it's one of the top ten R&B albums every created.  For me it's in the top 5.
B00846REIS|2.0|Is this becoming THE thing to write about now? The entire book is about sex...just like 50 Shades except no bondage. I HATE the F.. word and that is all they can seem to say.<br />Two stars is generous....

0385344333|2.0|I love the Reacher books, however this one just goes on and on.  Jack Reacher is not the Jack Reacher that I have come to know and Love.  There is no action, no excitement.  This is the worst of the series.
034537410X|3.0|I found it to be a plus that the book was free of dream interpretations and other spirituality-related things. Dreams and lucid dreaming are scientific phenomenon that too often get tangled up in woo.<br /><br />The suggested exercises in the book are enjoyable. You are to record dreams, and recognize any unusual things that would make you aware that you are dreaming. These \\"dreamsigns\\" can be put into four different categories, and you can keep track of the most common type of dreamsigns. Along with testing your dream state (periodically examining situations to see whether you are dreaming), this is supposed to help you realize when you are dreaming.<br /><br />They are enjoyable, but not especially effective. What typically happens is that in a dream I decide that I am not dreaming, and I integrate any dreamsigns into what I think is reality. I dreamed about pink kittens and thought \\"isn't it interesting that cats are the only animal that have naturally pink fur\\". I've been recording dreams since age 13 and have always been able to recall them in detail; supposedly those are good starting points.<br /><br />The exercises for wake induced lucid dreaming are especially frustrating. You are supposed to meditate for awhile and eventually you will be able to get out of your body and walk on the ceiling. I've been doing this type of meditation for about 10 years, and have never experienced wake induced lucid dreaming.<br /><br />The book reads like an infomercial in some parts, with lots of testimonials about how after doing what the author says, or buying his products, the person was able to have lucid dreams. There are also testimonials about how amazingly vivid and life-changing the dreams were.<br /><br />The best advice the book gives is to wake up a few hours before your actual wake-up time, get out of bed for a few minutes, and then go back to sleep. If you have a partner that wakes up early, or a pet that demands breakfast at 4am, or have to take morning pills,these annoyances can help you!<br /><br />THIS was what got me to finally have lucid dreams. They are not intense or life-changing and I don't really get to do whatever I want. They are almost always of flying, and I'm always in the position I'm sleeping in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book  went into  a lot of detail so you felt like you knew the charters and what they were going through  .
0374214913|1.0|A complete waste of time.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book when I read the title and then read the description in the fly leaf. This should have been a much better book. The plot was bland. The prose was something out of high school. Sadly, I think people will buy this book for the same reason's I did. A book about a fantasy, bookstores and geeks. How could you go wrong?<br /><br />Its reasuring that this is a shared sentiment.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|How does he keep putting out books that grab you from the beginning and leave you wanting for more when you are finished.  Best writer around!!!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and the Third season did not disappoint.  There were twists and turns just like in previous seasons and more shocking reveals.  I find the acting great and the writing very captivating and I am not a tween, teen or 20 something (although all those age groups would love it).  If you've watched Seasons 1 and 2 then it's a no-brainer, you must get Season 3.  If you haven't seen any of them, by them all for someone as a holiday or birthday gift or for yourself.  If you know someone (or you) likes Vampire Diaries, The Twilight Series, Gossip Girl, 90210 etc..its got a great mix of all of these with total suspense and new mysteries each episode.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book held my attention all the way to the end. A few little unexpected twists and turns at the end. That is Mr.Child's writings and we should expect them however, they still surprise me.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|\\"Your gonna pay me for a service that I'm gonna preform. Your gonna give me the particulars of her schedule, her habits. I'll act on them accordingly. I won't give you any details on those activities because the less you know the better for everyone involved.\\" Chris (Hirsch) is in debt bad. He owes the wrong people a ton of money and thinks the only way out is to kill his mother and collect the insurance money. He hires a man named Killer Joe (McConaughey) to take care of the job. When Chris can't come up with the money needed to hire him they work out a deal. Chris soon changes his mind. I am a McConaughey fan...yeah I said it. I'll deal with a shirt off scene in every movie because I like his style and his movies are entertaining. This one is no exception and may be my favorite role of his yet. He is so sadistic and evil in this but also keeps his charm so you don't fully hate him. He is both over the top and laid back. The movie itself is very very violent and bloody but I have to admit that I loved it. There is some humor in this and you laugh when you know you shouldn't but thats the sign of good humor. This is a movie that could have been one dimensional but with the cast and writing it really goes deeper and while not a movie that makes you think the whole time it does keep you guessing what will happen next. If you can handle this movie then I say watch it. I really liked it. Overall, a very entertaining dark movie that I really liked but it not for everyone. I say A-.

B0042RJWTC|2.0|Some episodes played through, but others were glitchy.  In some cases, you could not play through the episode.  It would stop and you could not fast forward to get past the glitch.  The disks appeared sort of transparent.  You could see the print on the other side through the playing side.  I don't know if that was the problem.  I returned this item and received a full refund, which I do appreciate.

1439152802|4.0|I have read all three of Morton's previous novels and she quickly became one of my favorite authors.  I have to say that I enjoyed her previous ones a bit more than this one.<br /><br />At some point, about half way through, the story seemed to become very slow.  This did not, in any way, diminish the quality of her writing or the overall story. (And by the way...the info given that may not seem important IS!) So I kept reading and I'm so glad I did! The plot is brilliant! I'm so impressed with how Morton can take a simple story and add such twists and turns that has me either gasping or shaking my head in amazement by the end of the novel.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a satisfying and well written story...do yourself a favor and be sure to read this one, in addition to her previous three, if you haven't already done so.
0316056863|1.0|This book is extremely badly written, is insanely boring and quite stupid. This is neither a memoire, nor a biography - it is a mix of simple lame narrative with some trying to be funny self-help useless advices.  I got an impression that Fey just wanted to write something for the sake of know - using her popularity to make more money with very little effort and I cannot believe I fell for it! I have not laughed once while reading this book.
B002M2T1UO|2.0|Just received 11-12-12 , nice boxed set and looks like plenty of extras .<br />Everything seems fine , untill I pulled dvds out of pockets .<br />Most have several scratches and many have what I guess to be glue spots .<br />Guess I'll have too watch all of them right away to see if they are good or bad .<br />At $70, you get what you pay for , crap .

B007R12TNQ|5.0|A real cute movie that a family can enjoy together. the chipmunks are so cute and I love the man over them.
0767802470|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it and the last time I saw it.  Watching how the U-Boat Crews probably lived, fought, and died in WWII is what this film is all about.  Very easy to follow the subtitles.  Awesome acting and combat scenes.  The quality of this movie is apparent from the very beginning to the very end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story. The writing is spellbinding and intense.  Why on earth would they need another glowing review?  There are already so many.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Not sure why this movie didn't do better at the Box Office but pretty sure it was because there were no gays, lesbians, smokers, blacks, or anti Christian actors cussing and wearing pants below their waists.  This is a wholesome movie with a combination of romance, action, adventure, and future Star Wars type fantasy all combined in to one perfect example of how a Great Movie will remain in my Library.  Clean Entertainment. Not one cuss word.  Wow.  What a concept for success in America today.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book.  My heart ached for the pain that both of the main characters had endured during their childhood.  The ending was a happy surprise.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  Other reviewers are right, it does allow you to get better items and upgrades for money.  You must set parental controls if you have a child playing it and you must use restraint if you are an adult.  The game can be played without spending any money,  just takes longer to expand or get certain items.  Personally I am addicted to it and will only spend money on it when they have a sale.

B004ZMXTRA|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out! I used to have it on DVD, but then my sister moved out! But I love the beat of the drumline and I love the competition of each schools drumline. It's my favorite part of the halftime show during high school friday night football! Definitely a fave music movie. I will keep watching it over and over and over again, because it will never get old! I purchased this movie on Amazon because I was craving it for a little while and I wanted to watch it NOW! So, purchasing it off of Amazon is good for a right now type of situation.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The author does a great job of portraying domestic violence as well as mental illness is the best way possible. I think this book is honest and such a page turner. You rally behind the main character and only want whats best for her.
0891419063|5.0|Favorite WW 2 memoir along with Company Commander, Bootprints, Tank Driver and Quartered Safe Out Here, You Can't Get Much Closer than this and Goodbye Darkness.  Horrible events told by an intelligent sensitive man.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book because it was different from my ordinary book choices.<br />For me, some of the fiction was a little difficult to believe, and it prevented me to get lost in the story.<br />I would still choose it again, and my book club found that it did stimulate a nice discussion.
0807014273|5.0|I read this book many years ago for my high school English class. I was looking for something small to take on a trip recently, and saw it on the bestseller list, so I bought myself a new copy. It was as relevent to me today as it was back then, and I hope to apply some of Dr. Frankl's concepts in my own life, and use them as I advise others in crisis. I gave a copy to a friend going through great and long term suffering, and she absolutely loved it. She was very inspired, and although her suffering continues, I have noticed a great improvement in her health already.<br /><br />This is a book which draws on universal truths celebrated and taught by all major religions. It would make excellent interfaith reading material, and is also useful in combination with sacred texts to teach and bring context to religious practice and belief in modern time.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Receiving this parcel instantly brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />The shipping time took shorter than expected. *Bonus, indeed! Upon arrival, the items came nicely packed in a box. It was further wrapped in with a cardboard, ensuring that it doesn't get squashed during the shipping.<br /><br />The Piano Guys were superb. If you've heard them on YouTube, you'll know that they're good. The CD quality is certainly better than that you hear on YouTube.<br /><br />In short, I'm glad I got it! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really interesting premise and great characters. A great read for those who enjoyed the Harry Potter series and are looking for a fun escape.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|Of the albums thus far, this III one feels the most focused of the bunch. Without any over-layered tracks, each song has a unique feel independent of the other tracks. Alice's lyrics are darker, while the driving beats by Ethan suit her vocals perfectly.<br /><br />I was hoping to not be disappointed, and this album is excellent! The first time I heard Affection was while I was driving with the bass up, and DAMN, what a great song. Ethan is surely underrated as a producer, and what's not to love about Alice's use of her voice?<br /><br />My favorite album of the year with only a month left to go.<br /><br />Notable tracks: Affection, Plague, Child I Will Hurt You, Wrath of God
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book details one of the main characters reasons for his behavior and reveals a brand new twist to their relationship; a new perspective to keep one guessing.Good reading.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Other reviewers have said it, but I'll confirm the themes: the third Hunger Games novel has no depth. It creates tension and builds to crescendo time and time again - then just skips over the action with a gauzy \\"she spent weeks recovering in the hospital wing\\" throw-away. Characters that showed promise in the first two books are treated as two-dimensional cardboard stand-ups in the third. Really, nothing interesting happens. Or if it does, Collins gives it a teasing sentence or two of poor explanation. Katniss makes a bold move when she has a chance to execute President Snow - how exciting, what happens next? Oh - we fast forward several weeks and everything's resolved. Everything as in, well, NOT whatever you want to know because the author is too busy finishing the book to add any explanatory details at all.<br />This book is full of really awkward turns of phrase and lots of dangling scenarios and character development, too, if that's your cup of tea. The only way this hot mess makes sense is if you say it's confusing, meandering and full of holes because that's what war and violence do to people. Is it a clever demonstration of the effect of war on the human mind? No, that's giving it too much credit. If that connection IS there, it's accidental, not intentional, based on how poorly the story is constructed. It's just a serious of swings - and misses.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|A remake of the Alien series with not much drama. Acting was OK if only pedestrian. Special effects were perhaps the best part of the movie.

030758836X|1.0|Ok, I'm old. However, this author forgot to write the ending! How does this happen? I won't read her again.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|The last song on Down on the Upside was titled \\"Boot Camp\\". One of the most beautiful Soundgarden songs and viewed by SG nuts like myself as the perfect ending. Needless to say, I always hoped they'd get back together or at least sell a damn t-shirt I can wear to prove my age. When `Live to Rise' came out, I got online to find a good oven to stick my head into, but I refrained. To have Soundgarden grouped with the horrendous music on the Avengers soundtrack was horrifying. I was freaking out about this new album. Will life as I know it end?<br /><br />Will Cornell ask Timbaland for help in \\"dropping\\" beats? Will Kim Thayil be arrested by Homeland Security? Will Ben Shepard calm down? Will Matt Cameron implode from being too awesome?<br /><br />The answer is a resounding no! And it shows! King Animal is simply awesome. My first impression was disdain, at the `you know my name' -esque titled `Been away too  long'. Yeah, it starts off okay, slightly meh, and then 2 minutes in, you know Soundgarden is still Soundgarden.  The euphoria for me peaked about two minutes in, and lasted all the way through the album. Glad you're back, guys! Thanks!!!!<br /><br />Favorite song - By Crooked Steps
B005XN0SGU|2.0|well i am not quite one too buy apps, but you see I really loved the idea of reading my comics on my kindle fire HD. i shopped around and around looking for a decent free app (for I am cheap!!) and had no luck. Finally i saw this app, screen shots looked great, UI seemed smooth, you know, the usuall components of searching for the best app to fit your needs. So i opened up my dusty old digital wallet and forked over the ones and zeros. I was on my way to digital comic wonderland!<br /><br />When I first got used to the app it was everything I had hoped and dreamed.  Untill about a week ago when my reading experience came down to reading a page and then having the app force close on me. then of course it dosent open back up where you left off on the book, so your stuck trying to find the page you left off on without any sort of thmbnail preview, just page numbers. I usually don't give bad reviews because it's just not worth the time and effort. But, in this case im not mad, I'm dissapointed... you know the feeling app maker, you know. Im dissapointed because I love you.<br /><br />Please have an update in the near future, I just don't wanna be let down again, my ticker just can't take it anymore...<br /><br />Forever yours<br /><br />Me..
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Another great experience with John Corey and Kate.  Timely also given events in our world.<br />As with all DeMille's work - great writing.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Until Moonrise Kingdom, The Royal Tennenbaums was my favorite Wes Anderson movie.  Moonrise has many of the same elements that made RT such a great movie:  Outstanding cast, great script, intricate sets, but Moonrise elevates them all into a charming examination of the human condition.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An inspiring book and \\"eye-opener\\" about the war.  Adam Brown was a dedicated Navy Seal and deserves recognition.<br />Thisi was also a story about the importance of good friends and family.

B000W93CHC|3.0|I did enjoy this book quite a bit.  I read the Pillars of the Earth and absolutely loved how each character spans decades and you see how they transform yet remain true to themselves.  I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how life would be effected by the plague and how it must have impacted the psyche of the people of the time.  All that said, the book was far too formulaic since it seemed just like Pillars of the Earth, just a hundred years later.  And the end was slightly anti-climatic because it felt like the true climax of the book came a hundred pages earlier.  I actually think that if you haven't read Pillars, you will more fully enjoy this one because you won't see any of the twists coming.  With that said, if you want a good read that will be entertaining this is the one.
0812992784|4.0|It was not how it was supposed to be. But for writing The Satanic Verses Salman Rushdie was sentenced to death by people who had no jurisdiction over him and had not read his book. This was endorsed by many people who were not able to read. His book was not the point. Rushdie was a pawn in a geo-political game, in which the politicians of Muslim indignation considered Islam to be insulted, and wanted to impose their rulings on everybody else. It took nine years before he was considered safe enough to get out of hiding. The threat did not really go away till 2002, another four years. Joseph Anton is the story of those years of survival mostly in isolation  and extreme insecurity.<br /><br />Rushdie starts by giving his background, how he became a writer and how he developed the ideas for his books. The story of the fatwa begins with Ayatollah Khomeini's pronouncement  of 14 February 1989. Rushdie went into hiding in his own country, the UK. In its streets extremist called for him to be murdered. Politicians wavered. Somehow, many in the media considered it the death threat the result of provocation by him, even of his character.<br /><br />So Rushdie defended his book. It did not work.  After a year or so, in 1990 he was tricked into a \\"reconciliation\\" with Islam. He regretted it nearly as soon as he had done so - Rushdie is not a religious person - and it did not bring him the promised benefit of withdrawal of the fatwa. Rushdie shows how his defence evolved. It went from the freedom of literature - \\"the world of books\\" in Rushdie-speak - towards freedom of speech in general, and increasingly, simply liberty.  Rushdie does mention Hindu fundamentalism, does not mention, though, Christian fundamentalism.  His struggle was with some defenders of \\"Islam\\". Thus, in the sphere of ideas, the conflict became straight jacked in the so- called clash of civilizations.  At that level it was unsolvable. \\"Islam\\" cannot be insulted or appeased, people can.<br /><br />But Rushdiehad to live on. How can one survive nine years of isolation, and even manage to co-parent one's child, have a love life, face the cancer of one's first wife?  Rushdie records everything. We even get illnesses and deaths of his friends and supporters. Not unique things that people face, but Salman Rushdie had to come to terms with these under appalling circumstances. The incidents show a world much shrunk. His main prop was that he was a family man. He promised his eldest son to write a book for him. Even then it took him some time to realise that this was the way to neutralize the fatwa, to continue, indeed re-start, writing. Rushdie describes this realisation in detail.<br /><br />He came up for fresh air during his visits to the USA. It is also here that the book loses some of its steam. In the USA Rushdie was lionised by the cultural elite. One gets names of celebrities, but they add little to the developing story.<br /><br />Except in one field, and that was where their input mattered most. The fatwa was a geo-political move; it was  stopped by geo-political pressure exercised mainly by the UK and USA. In September 1998 the fatwa was put on hold by the Iranian government. Its effects, and the threat to Rushdie's life, were still felt much till, roughly, 2002. By then, Muslim fundamentalists had other problems, being put on the defensive in the aftermath of 9/11 2001.<br /><br />We are used to the Salman Rushdie as the master of magical realism, fertile imagination and unbelievably nimble sentences. But he had arrived in such an absurd place that to describe it sober language sufficed. He expresses the alienation that he felt by using throughout the third person for himself. Rushdie describes his behaviour during these years and explains his motives . It is an autobiography, though, and, curiously given Rushdie's interest in renaissance Florence,  one is reminded of the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini's 1558 attempt. In his determination to practise his art, Rushdie,like Cellini, is a towering figure both in his personal life and in his account of it. Other people fill the space only when the author/subject is not there - which does not happen often in an autobiography. This is not to imply that Salman Rushdie is not grateful to the people who in various ways kept him alive. He is, profusely so, but the book is about him - and his art.<br /><br />It is a great book in the first, and a good memoir in the second half. Joseph Anton illuminates a decisive moment of our times, the return of religious fundamentalism on the world stage after a long absence. Individuals were crushed, lives were taken. But Salman Rushdie is still here. Luckily, we can expect more books from that great enchanter.
0446580848|2.0|John Corey is a grizzled former NYPD detective thrown into the fight on terror. And in previous outings, I have enjoyed him and the historic situations he is placed. But with The Panther, being in John Corey's head and hearing his endless quips is exhausting. He is so caustic and irreverent that he loses credibility and my interest. I frequently wished that someone would take him out and that the more interesting Paul Brennan would run off with Kate Mayfield...both, by the way, are largely thrown away as characters. For fans or first time DeMille readers, if you plan to read this novel, I would suggest finding an abridged version because it is overly long and terribly repetitive. It regurgitates plot explanations ad nauseam giving no credit to the intelligence of the reader.<br /><br />In substance, two devices are missing versus the far superior The Lion's Game: placing Corey primarily in New York works for this character versus bouncing around Yemen which is a bit fantastic and having a more engaging villain who actually shows up on more than a few pages. Some of this is explained by the fact that DeMille got trapped by his own narrative from the previous book which involved a CIA plot that remained unresolved for the Corey and Mayfield characters. All of this produced a very boring book from an author renowned for pumping out pulpy but solid thrillers for the beach or plane.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther was a readable,current book. DeMille takes one through the current terrain and difficulties of Afghanistan.At the same time he speaks of the culture and people of this region.<br />A most enjoyable book.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|My 5 year old loves this app. He is the main one who plays it. I dont realy play it much because Id rather play the real thing. But has great tables and graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Terrific game, perfectly challenging, relaxing, but occasionally INFURIATING!  on top of which, no unnecessary permissions or scary networks, no ads or extra purchases. My only request would be hints that tell you if you are on the right trail instead of giving the entire solution. Can't wait till the next quell (please!!!! ) &amp;yeah I've already got reflections.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|If you have not read any of the Jack Reacher Series by Lee Child I would recommend you get after it. I have finally finished all 17 books in the series and can actually get some sleep. You cannot put these books down once you start the 1st page!!! The down side is the rest of my reading now seems a bit boring.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This is a really good film! Lindsay Lohan was so cute in this movie, & I actually like this version a little better than the original 1961 version. I say this, because it's probably the parents that makes it better. The original version was pretty good, too, but the parent's were kind of uptight in the original version. No offense! & plus, this version is more heart-warming & very extraordinary. I appreciate you for allowing me to offer my support to you!
B000V63BEU|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of Marley's greatest hits that brings together the creative talents of some fantastic music artists. I was never a big Reggae fan until I heard this CD. This CD has been added to my all-time favorites of my music collection. A must have if you are a fan of the late great Bob Marley, or Reggae music.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham scores with another book featuring a growing twist of fate for the main character that essentially makes him a lawless man. Intriguing, suspenseful and above all enjoyable.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I usually love Nelson De Mille, love his previous work, love his books, BUT! this one is not my favorite!  He has too much of a geography lesson on the middle east and not enough \\"on the edge of my seat action\\".  I am 39% through (on my Kindle) and wish it was just OVER!
0345803485|4.0|When I first started hearing about this series, I'd decided not to read it because my kink factor is pretty low.  A friend of mine had read them and told me it wasn't anywhere near as twisted as she'd expected, and she loaned me her books.  The story and characters are a bit dark, and I found Anastasia to be irritating in the way that only young twenty-something girls can be, but I found these books to be incredibly easy and enjoyable to read.  I blew through them in less than a week and enjoyed them for the most part.  Christian was at times overbearing and arrogant, but when he was vulnerable, he broke my heart ... and when he was hell-bent on seduction, he was irresistible.  I really did try to like Anastasia ... I think she was just too much like some of the young women I'm acquainted with for me to do much more than tolerate her.
B004I9G486|1.0|i don't hate it because i can't use it. i want to return it and i'm waiting for them to get back to me as to how. saying i like it, love it or hate it wouldn't be fair. it doesn't work for my car.
B003JTHWPA|1.0|This was the most awfully boring book I've ever read!  It was for a discussion group or I wouldn't have read most of it.  Had no idea it was a classic, but now wonder what made it so. All of our discussion group thought the same thing!

B009CPJHY4|4.0|I wished they gave us subtitles (English).  Also, my slow computer didn't handle full screen presentation well, but the only other option was the original size, which was tiny.  I wish there are some middle options.
034580404X|5.0|I was hooked on this book after the first few chapters. I fell for the hype and finally broke down and read it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think some people are really not seeing this story for what it really is. Its entertainment. It is not meant to emulate life because there woudldn't be a story. Was your own love life this interesting? Probably not. And if so, I'd like to read your memoir. I loved all the things that some people are seeming to dislike about the story. I'm 24 years myself and just thinking about my first time and first few relationships, I was very naive and innocent as well. I didn't know all there is to know about sex, or all the tricks to the trade. I think that's what you have to remember and think about when you are reading this story. From beginning to end, I felt my eyes couldn't read this story fast enough. I do hope that that author will seriously put her energies into writing this from Christian's point of view. That was definately a teaser for me. I kept turning the pages looking for the next chapter. Overall this book waw really good and you should definately give it a chance. And do have the second book ready after you finish the first because you won't be prepared for the ending. You have been warned.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great special effects and great cast of actors.  True to form and based on the comic book charcters.  Will probably add to my 'own' collection!
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Meh.  To be fair, I am a fan of Mr Depp odd works(Ed wood anyone??) Set in the colorful but oftentimes psychedelic pastels of 1970s New England, we watch in amazement as young Barnaby Collins, disturbed from several millennium of slumber, tears thru several construction workers who mistakenly disturb his grave site. Bad move for them! That was the most violent scene in the whole movie.  The rest of the movie ambles along quite nicely, a leisurely jog in the park if you will, with a few plot twists thrown in for good measure. The plot was as thin as a buffet line after someone cuts a big one. . I actually did fall asleep several times while watching. Not that I was bored, ok I was. my new 55 inch tv made it look hotter than it was. I do recommend viewing in HD for the best viewing experience.  Overall? Meh.
B008D30K7E|5.0|A fantastic read. Uplifting energetic and refreshingly different, not to mention exceedingly difficult to put down! Definately worth a read.
141659521X|5.0|Albert Einstein said the definition of 'insanity' is \\"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\\".  You'd think that with the body count and stealth reputation Mitch has garnered his years of service that people would learn.  They don't.  Idiots.  In 'The Last Man' there is some pretty rampant corruption going on in Afghanistan (big surprise there) and one of our most important intelligence brains has been kidnapped. This man holds more secrets than Bill Clinton's belly button and he must be found at ALL costs.<br /><br />Enter Mitch stage left.<br /><br />Unfortunately even Mitch isn't above becoming a target and thus enters the first of three huge surprises.  And I'm not being my usual superfluous soul either. You will be floored when you find out who is sent to assassinate Mitch and the second huge shocker comes very soon after that.  I've been a fan of Flynn's since I cracked open one of his books years back, and one of the many things I've enjoyed is how he writes his books right \\"to the edge\\".  But even I was surprised at how far he went with #3.<br /><br />OK enough with the \\"you won't believe this\\" moments of this book, on with the story.  As I've stated earlier the peaceful and serene country of Afghanistan is being run by some corrupt individuals.  I know, I know, hard to believe.  But the guys who think they are in charge have no idea they are being played by someone much larger.  And smarter.  Mitch is sent over to sort through the bull and comes face to face with some politically correct paper pushers.  While reading about Mitch blowing apart the head of some terrorist is a thrill, hearing him decimate someone at a conference room table is a very close second.  He lays the pimp hand down and it's stirring each and every time.<br /><br />In this story we hear a bit more of the infighting between the leaders of Afghanistan and how politics is pretty much the same worldwide. It's a bit more bloody over there though as the opposing party tends to use bullets instead of ballots. Hanging people instead of hanging chads. \\"Red\\" and \\"blue\\" over there means something totally different. Vince throws in a story within a story and we get a great view of just how murderous and deadly it is over there. On that note let me mention that there are a few scenes of torture that are pretty raw. They're so raw in fact that even when they're only alluded to, it's tough because your brain is going to make you remember.<br /><br />'The Last Man' is everything you would expect from Mitch. Our chiseled warrior is getting a bit older but the only proof you have of that is his driver's license. His enemies, foreign and domestic, would do well to remember that.  They won't. But even a 75% Mitch is better than most of us at 99.9%.  Let me go back and quickly touch on something I just said: \\"his enemies, foreign and domestic.\\"  I make no apologies that I really do hope and wish that we have someone like Mitch Rapp alive and well working for us. The events in these books are based on reality and I feel so much better (even if it is an illusion) that there is someone out there willing to kill anyone who is a threat to us. ANY. ONE. Foreign or domestic. Terror is terror. Evil is evil. War is hell, but it's nice to know that someone is willing to stand toe to toe with the devil and say \\" not on my watch, not. on. my. watch\\".<br /><br />Major props to Mr. Flynn for doing what he does best while dealing with serious medical problems.  Major props to Mitch for letting this reader escape, yet again, into a world where the good guys win.  At least for a little while.  Maybe.sing party tends to use bullets instead of ballots.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is written in an interesting manner, with perspectives of both the murder suspect (the husband) and his victim (the wife). It has enough story and suspense to keep you interested, and gradually reveals more detail about what happened until you can pretty much figure it out on your own, although from the very beginning it's not very hard to guess what happens. I found the ending annoying but not surprising.<br />One thing I didn't really like was how the \\"clues\\" early in the book tend to \\"lie\\" - if you are trying to figure out what happened, you can't necessarily depend on what is said in the book to be the truth, as the situation changes as the book goes on. I prefer mysteries that don't mislead you in these situations.<br />Overall I enjoyed it as a casual read.

B00A12VJZM|1.0|I will not pay for and get ripped off by this extravagant, pricey rehash of songs I already have.  Except for a couple of \\"new\\" songs, probably from their vault of unreleased songs, they are not giving me anything new and that I have not heard before.  I am a long time Stonehead, having followed them from the early 60's and seeing them live in NYC and at Altamont (I won't get into that debacle), and have their original vinyl albums with their valuable album covers still intact.  I do not like anything re-edited, unless it was intially released in mono and converted to stereo.  I prefer to hear songs performed the way I originally heard them on the radio, minus subsequently added licks.  I am a purist.<br /><br />How many greatest hits collections do they need to release?  I have a few of them already and it seems that they have them squeezed together into this three disc download.  I don't buy cd's anymore, for storage issues, and download all my music these days.  Are the Stones that desperate and hard up for money to add to their already huge treasury, that they need to try to scam us into buying this \\"same old song\\" collection?  If they are they should generously donate their huge profits to victims of Hurricane Sandy and/or the homeless and hungry worldwide.  I'm not buying into this.  Sorry Mick, even with your London School of Economics business brain, your one percenter mentality doesn't do anything for me. As for Keith, he lives in New York with his Staten Island (which was devasted by Sandy) wife, and he should open up his wallet as well.  I've already donated.

I love to backpack but, at 70, I don't think I would want to attempt the trail by myself as Cheryl did.  I am only 1/4 of the way through the book. It is well-written and engrossing. Having read more, I become a little disgusted with her immature behavior toward food, water, and money, but it is still a good read.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|So I did listen to his first two free ep's but I refused to listen to the last one he put out because the sound quality was trash on the other MP3s. He definitely ensured these were on point. I already enjoyed the two albums I did hear but the sound quality was trash. I spend good money on my audio equipment and when I play MP3's I really hear the imperfections. Most people enjoy crappy MP3's but not I. They make my ears bleed.<br /><br />IF you want the best quality out, buy this cd. If not just continue listening to the trashy A$$ free Mp3 version he put out for free. Dont be an idiot and spend money to buy the MP3's again from amazon.....CD or bust.

B009KHDT0C|1.0|One of the top 5 worst films I have ever ever ever had the displeasure to snooze through. The tone established during the first few minutes is promising. After that, it finds new lows to sink to with each scene - well, I slept through the last half so maybe it redeemed itself. Honestly, this thing actually made me feel kind of sick like I was getting the flu or something. Yes. It's that bad. And I hate saying it because I adore JD and admire TB's other films. WTF happened ??? Bad writing! Bad make up!! Sheesh. I'll shut up now cuz I'm sure u get the pic. It's BAD.
B0042U2HN2|5.0|This 9-disc set includes both piano concertos, the violin sonatas, the cello sonatas, the piano trios, the piano quartets, the piano quintet, and various solo piano works.  The performances and recordings (some dating back to the mid-1950's) are all first-rate.  Rubinstein was careful to maintain his technique even into his 70's and 80's and the piano-playing here is formidable.  His partners in the chamber works are also distinguished musicians: the (young) Guarneri quartet, Piatigorsky, Szeryng, and Fournier.  It is a shame that more of the solo piano works were not included, although we do get the Ballades and Piano Sonata No. 3.  The biggest surprise for me was the two excellent versions of the concertos, both recorded in the 1950's.  These performances are as good as any in the catalog, and finer than most.  Notes are not included with the set.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Page Turner that holds the interest. Provides great imagery. Kudos to the author for the female hero character. I appreciated the subtle hints of affection and the love theme without there being sex.
B000025706|5.0|This 9-disc set includes the mature solo piano concertos in performances by Andras Schiff and the Salzburg Camerata Academica under Sandor Vegh.  The piano sound is notably more recessed than in other versions, giving more attention to the orchestral half of the musical dialog.  Additionally, the Bosendorfer piano used by Schiff produces a sound that will not be confused with a modern Steinway.  Schiff's performances are very fine, occasionally adding slight ornamentation and trills to the solo part.  The orchestra under Vegh is nearly ideal, and the recording quality (across several different venues) is very fine.  Note that this set does not include the two-piano concerto, the three-piano concerto, or the four youthful arrangements of piano concertos by other composers.  Schiff also performs No. 12 and No. 14 in versions without wind parts.  Notes for the set are included.<br />There are many other excellent versions of these works in the catalog.  Schiff can be compared alongside Uchida, Barenboim, and Brendel, but first choice in these pieces has to go to the immensely satisfying Perahia set.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Cast of characters are all awesome and well played by the respective actors, however, Hulk and Ironman smashs this one into the record books.  If Marvel continues to devolop the Super Universe of its characters into the rolls as written in the comics, there's no telling when this infinite voyage will ever end.  Are the Inhumans and Black Bolt in the works?  Keep up the fine work.

B008GFI4KY|5.0|If you are looking for an album that is a musically innovative masterpiece, then this is not what you want. If you want to listen to music that is classic, feel good, unpretentious rock n roll, then look no further. This album is a breath of fresh air for my ears, in a time when musicians seemingly replaced their guitars for computers and midi keyboards. I might not be the best critic, I'm just you're average joe whose lovin this music....

1416550534|4.0|My favourite of her books, is the Secret Garden. This one lacked a little in the story line, but very readable. She has a way of only giving you a glimpse of what has happened, or will happen, which wets your appetite for reading a few more pages, and then something else happens, so you want to read even more. I wouldn't miss her books for the world, long may she keep writing. I am dying to start the Secret Keeper. Susan M

0446573027|2.0|I really don't t think this is a good thriller or even a thriller. At the book's end you'll cry because that end is laughable. I didn't read the last 20 pages of a book with 500! This is a good plot? or just a boring one.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|This review is about the new 3 disc set and not the music itself, (Which as any self respecting ELP fan already kows this is the classic of all classics!).<br /><br />OK that being said, I really only purchased this new set for the 5.1 disc.<br /><br />Disc #3 sounds pretty good, decent separation between channels, (Could have been a tiny bit better spaced though), good bass and not over the top on the treble. Disc #3 also has all of the 2012 stereo remixes in DVD quality.<br /><br />Disc #2 is the cd quality of the remixes, interesting stuff and I'll leave it open to personal tastes but I enjoyed them. Certainly won't replace the original version but it's a nice change if your a fanatic like me.<br /><br />Disc #1 is definitely an improvement over my late '90's Rhino cd.<br /><br />The packaging is a tri-fold with a slim booklet with nothing terribly new other than some info right off the start about  Steve Wilson who was in charge of the remastering process.<br /><br />So overall a worthwhile purchase and I'm basically happy with it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is the best of The Walking Dead to date.  The first episode is nothing but action that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Highly recommended.
B008FPZQQU|1.0|This review is about the new 3 disc set and NOT about the music, (If you're an ELP fanatic then you'll probably agree that this is a stone cold classic).<br /><br /> I only bought this version for the 5.1 surround disc and nothing more, and if that's your intention you may want to think twice before ordering!<br /><br /> Disc 3# -<br />The surround mix is set up as:<br />Center - Vocals.<br />Front L & R - Drums & Bass.<br />Rear L & R - Mostly keyboards.<br />This is a very logical mix for a 3 piece band, however I think that the rear separation is way too \\"tight\\", in other words not enough distinct space between the rear left & right speakers to give us that special ear candy, you know? (Does anybody remember Quad?). However to be honest the sound does jump out at you from every speaker in the room, so it's actually quite impressive just the same.<br />BUT - My biggest complaint is that they COMPLETELLY OMITTED Clotho, Lachesis & Tank and replaced those key tracks with some useless jam called \\"Rave Up\\"... Are they nuts?<br />They also have an alternate ending for Knife Edge, and that's totally inexcussable and they never should have realeased this butchered version in my opinion!<br />The last 2 pages of the liner notes do explain that they lost some of the master tapes, so that's why they didn't include the entire record. Well what kind of excuse is that? So my question is then why release it at all? Should of had a warning sticker on the cover like \\"Loyal Fans Beware, Incomplete Album!\\", you know?<br /><br /> Disc #2 sounds very good, especially by today's standards, containing alternate mixes which would be intersting & enjoyable to any ELP fan (Like me), especially the 2 takes of Lucky Man, very cool.<br />And the sound is very crisp too, different that what I'm used to though it's okay and I don't mind at all, (After all these are intended to be alternate takes & mixes and are supposed to sound new, fresh & different, right?).<br /><br /> Disc #1 is the original album, and is also very clean sounding with great dynamic range, though \\"bright\\". As any loyal follower of this album you would already know that it's always been a rather \\"dark\\" sounding record; Definitely not gloomy in any way, just not too bright... But now it's a bit trebley and/or modern sounding to my ears.<br />That being said, what the heck gave them the right to change the original sound? I'm sorry but that's just not acceptable!<br /><br /> I really am disgusted and simply can't beleive it, just look at what they have done, what a mess! Another example of the record companies screwing the fans I suppose. And did the band approve this? I certainly hope not, but if so shame on them too!<br /><br />PS: If you already own the (Awesome Sounding) Brain Salad Surgery on Rhino DVD audio then at least you have a killer 5.1 version of Lucky Man as a bonus track.<br /><br />Otherwise continue to enjoy the correct sounding music on your late '90's Rhino or the later Victory versions, both sound a lot closer to the original vinyl.

B008AT9XOC|2.0|I absolutely HATED the ending of the this new Director's cut. Everybody and I mean everybody dies, except for the plant. What I did like was the deleted scenes of utter mayhem with Oscar worthy special effects / miniatures. To see these deleted scenes you have to get this version. And it doesn't have the option of 'alternate endings'. So to get the 'HAPPY ENDING' that we've all grown accustomed to since the film's release 30 years ago, you must stick with the original dvd. To see the extras, get this version.

A very interesting story about a subject I find very interesting.

B007REV4YI|5.0|It was rumored over the last two years that the Bond series was in trouble and after 22 films and nearly five decades, the end of Bond would have been heartbreaking. Daniel Craig's bond was a different cut from Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. He was meaner and less capable of making fun of himself. The Bond series has always adapted with the culture and the current situation of the world, but the current world wasn't ready to make light of terrorism.<br /><br /> Bond always was more than gadgets and action. He seemed to do his job with a smile and cockiness that somebody who knew they were gonna win would wear. Well, thank goodness that the 23rd film of the series was made and this year, 2012, is the 50th anniversary of the longest running and most successful film franchise. \\"Skyfall\\" proves that it is much deserved.<br /><br /> The moment that the movie begins, you hear that hint of the familiar Bond theme song and the most ejects you into a breathtaking, intense and amazingly filmed chase scene. Nothing needs to be explained. With the words of M (Judi Dench), nestled away at England's Mi6, you understand the importance of the target. It was an early sign that the screenplay was going to be spectacular. As good as the opening sequence is, it is a shadow of what the movie holds for its viewers.<br /><br /> One of the most amazing things about \\"Skyfall\\" is how quality of an action movie it is. The Director, Sam Mendes, had done smaller movies like \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Road to Perdition\\", \\"Revolutionary Road\\" and \\"Away We Go\\", but \\"Skyfall\\" is a whole other entity. Possibly the use of Mendes was a highly successful attempt to not only get a beautifully filmed movie and a quality one, but also a Bond grounded in reality. Never once did the movie exceed that realm of possibility. Bond doesn't leap off of a cliff and jump into a plummeting helicopter, or slide on a motorcycle under a helicopter blade chopping into the ground or do anything superhuman. He's a man and the first thing that ruins a good action movie is an audience member who roles their eyes.<br /><br /> The effects are real. The stunt work is top notch. Daniel Craig, in fact, did a lot of his own stunts, adding to the films realism. The screenplay is fantastic and rich like a Bond movie should be. The Director, Mendes, may have not done much action in his career, but I have a feeling he may have just added a new wrinkle to his resume.<br /><br /> Easily, \\"Skyfall\\" is the best movie that Daniel Craig has been in and if you forget about the fact that 1962's \\"Dr. No\\", 1964's \\"Goldfinger\\" or Roger Moore's best \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\", had less technology to work with and still made great films, \\"Skyfall\\" is the best of the entire series. Then to take it a bit further, it may be the best action movie since \\"Die Hard\\", \\"Indiana Jones\\" or \\"Lethal Weapon\\". Like those films, \\"Skyfall\\" proves that keeping action movies grounded in reality and letting the audience know the man behind it, with all his flaws and quirks is a winning combination. Don't miss it.man and the first thing that ruins a good action movie is an audience member who roles their eyes.<br /><br /> The effects are real. The stunt work is top notch.

0345803485|4.0|I don't know how many people know this was originally Twilight fan fiction turned into something else, but that's why I decided to read it - plus all the hype.  I bought the series after I became hooked on reading the first book from a friend and being the nerd that I am decided this was the cheaper route to buy the trilogy.<br /><br />Here's how I felt reading the books:<br />Book 1: Christian is a jerk - see ya sucker<br />Book 2: Christian isn't so bad I find him charming<br />Book 3: No, I was wrong; he's a bit of a jerk with some charm<br />Overall: Who has this kind of stamina??<br /><br />I found the ending a bit disturbing.  But I enjoyed the preview of Christian's version and I look forward to reading that as a whole book when it comes out.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|As many other other reviewers out there on the net have pointed out, 'Koi No Yokan' is a Japanese phrase that describes the sense one gets when they know they will fall in love with someone. It's a beautiful concept and one that, when paired to what Deftones deliver sonically, gives the listener a direction for where the music is intended to take them internally: higher planes. Deftones don't want you to remain here on earth, they want to lift you up to that place where existential experience is beautiful, meaningful. It's debateable whether this 'phase' intended to begin with White Pony, but it certainly reached its peak with Diamond Eyes, in itself a dynamically powerful record, a perfect record. Koi No Yokan is, for me, on par with Diamond Eyes. It is that good.<br /><br />Deftones were classed as nu-metal when Adrenaline came out but they have never been a band to give into the angst and rage of their contemporaries. Tool decimated religious orders, and Rage Against the Machine decimated political orders, but Deftones just existed creating riffs and sounds that made people stop and tilt their heads. They gradually changed approaches, intending to rise above petty emotionalism and take you on an auditory journey. Originally that started with headbanging but somewhere along the line they realised people might want to hold up a candle instead.<br /><br />With Koi No Yokan, Deftones work to build atmosphere, which has become an essential part of any Deftones album. When Chino and the rest talk about 'dynamics', you hear it in play with tracks that are built to create an album as a whole. Carpenter and co create moshworthy riffage, responding to Chino's crooning, (and leopard screams) - his voice is a true instrument in itself. But none of the album is distasteful, it's all deliciously 'accessible' for new listeners. There are rest sections, hard sections, beautiful sections. Where Deftones excel are replacing aforementioned rage and angst with another emotion - love. Love is a strong theme for this band, whether it's love for a downed bandmate, for the experience of highs and lows of life, or for a lover. Love can be beautiful, powerful, but also heavy. To my knowledge, they are the only metal band that does this as successfully as they do.<br /><br />Brief breakdown of songs (note that my Australian release came with Swerve City as the first song):<br />1. Swerve City - Punchy syncopated guitar punches introduce you to Koi No Yokan. It's typical Deftones fair with some new dynamic to Chino's approach to vocals and some spacy atmospheric work in the latter half of the song. 4/5.<br />2. Romantic Dreams - A schizophrenic song with a few different colours to show. What begins as one those painfully urgent emotional sounding Deftones tracks kicksteps back and forth between reflection and aggression, then once again with a simply and catchy chorus. One of my favourite tracks. 5/5.<br />3. Leathers - Another spacey introduction hides a big fat right hook. Perhaps this should have been the opening track, it would have suited it. A heavy track, but with a beautiful primary chorus followed by a vocal enhanced secondary chorus. One of the first released to the public. Like something from Diamond Eyes. 5/5.<br />4. Poltergeist - This is perhaps the most straightforward track on the album, bringing nothing new to fans but it sounds like it belongs as one of the better songs off their self-titled albums. I like the lyrics personally and it carries a bit of energy and is more speedy than others on the album. 4/5.<br />5. Entombed - Perhaps the 'Digital Bath' or 'Change' of Koi No Yokan, Entombed is one of the softer, slower efforts. A pretty song, the band really asks you to be gentle with them here. 4/5.<br />6. Graphic Nature - Another classic harder Deftones song, with some great jazz-styled drumwork. Another song where Chino delves into someones mind. The chorus is awesome, perhaps one of the better songs. 5/5.<br />7. Tempest - This has to be one of Deftones best songs to date. There's not much to say as it was one of their first-released to the public along with Leathers. Catchy riffage, absolutely beautiful vocal work and a perfect blend of soft and hard in the one song. 5/5.<br />8. Gauze - Another classic Deftones rocker, and reminds me of something they might have done from Saturday Night Wrist. A churning and angry lead in with a beautiful chorus. A high energy track that heightens the listening experience. 4/5.<br />9. Rosemary - The softest and longest track here with a beautifully slow lead in, this song sucks you right in. A really spacey and pretty song that's perhaps the embodiment of the 'Koi No Yokan' ideal. The 'Passenger' of today. 5/5.<br />10. Goon Squad - Don't let the name fool you, the song is fun, aggressive and energetic, perhaps a little bit like 'CMND/CTRL' but with greater dynamics. It's surprising to see songs plastered at the bottom of the tracklist that could fit anywhere on the tracklist order realistically. Typical Deftones, a moshpit-pleaser. 5/5.<br />11. What Happened to You - A newer sounding dynamic for the Deftones. Another beautiful song with a newer sound we haven't really heard from them before - more atmosphere and an almost pop feel to it. Not a bad thing here, a nice closer! 4/5.<br /><br />I would not say this is their 'opus' or a 'masterpiece', but it's CLOSE. As you can see, there is no bad song here. Perhaps we will consider it a masterpiece in 10 years time. But, I would say it rates on par (if not better) with Diamond Eyes as their strongest overall effort. For Deftones fans, this is truly a treat. Don't just listen. Feel.

B009LA1QW6|4.0|Track by track review<br />1.Ride 4/5: the first single of the album, and also greatest video, it's not one of those songs you want to hear everyday, it's one of those songs that makes you feel something, like relief, when you need it, this kind of instructions written by Lana to make us feel better when we need it...<br />2.Cola 5/5: the mos criticized of the track list, it's not just a perfect song because of the metaphors in the lyrics, but also because of the vocal range in Lana's voice, just makes you feel like if you were listening to pervert angels.<br />3.American 3/5: it's not Lana's track list if it doesn't have a song to talk about the american life/dream, my personal lullaby and a very relaxing song.<br />4.Body Electric 5/5: When Lana song this track months ago, everybody knew it was something not just dark, but also beautiful, the perfect example of Lana's style, that makes you feel Lana's soul inside out<br />5.Blue Velvet 4/5: Part of the promotion for the H&M Sweaters, Lana makes a beautiful but short cover of a classic jazz song and gives it her sweet and sadcore wave.<br />6.Gods & Monsters 5/5: A very cinematographic cut of the album, makes us desperately wait for what it think would be a wonderful video, a beautiful track that reminds me of the originality of Lana in this musical world that we live in.<br />7. Yayo 4/5: Lana remakes one of the favorites of her pre-born to die era, not as good as the original version in my opinion, beautiful ballad.<br />8. Bel Air 5/5: One of the most loved of the track list, and also next Lana's single, makes us ride on a trip to the actual Paradise, a beautiful good bye to the second part of the greatest official debut in 2012.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I recommend this to everybody who is a science fiction fan. This will just open your appetite to what is to come. Great x-tras as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was totally captivating through all of the chapters.  I was hooked from the first page to the very last.  Suzanne Collins has a terrific imagination and is a good author.  I recommend these books to everyone of all ages.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved \\"Still Alice\\".  It was written from the point of view of the patient.  I felt as though I knew her and was experiencing what she did with her.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|She knocked it out! I have given this album a listen already and I absolutely love it. I have been a fan of hers since Stripped, and while that album is regarded as her best album to date by many, I have loved all her work since then, yes even Bionic. I am not going to get into a big long technical review, but all I will say is that the ballads in this album are PHENOMENAL! \\"Blank page\\" left me moved and in awe of how amazing this woman's voice is. I was actually underwhelmed with \\"Your Body\\", but it's grown on me since and I love it too! If you're an Aguilera fan you'll love this album. There is something for everyone, check it out!<br /><br />Personal stand out tracks for me:<br />Army of Me<br />Make The World Move<br />Your Body<br />Let there be Love<br />BLANK PAGE -  (My fave so far)<br />Best of Me -(Beautiful song)<br />Just a Fool - (Amazing country sounding song)<br /><br />*I bought the Deluxe Version and definitely can say that it's worth the extra money - \\"Light Up the Sky\\" and \\"Empty Words\\" are great little Ballads! Although  I wasn't feeling \\"Shut Up\\" on the deluxe(it's dedicated to all her haters (she has many) ;), but the Remix to Your Body is pretty fierce!
B005HSL626|4.0|Grandkids said this was really fun both agreed on this.<br />We recieved in good time and package was in good shape.<br />Thanks
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie was visually stunning but poorly written and directed. I am a sci-fi fan but this movie was horrible. The story made no sense, unbelievable characters and unrealistic reactions to situations.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Finally a book that gives you the reason you can't loose weight dispite following the government guidelines for \\"healthy eating\\".  Every diabetic or prediabetic should read it and take the information seriously.  Be informed about how your eating habits impact your health.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This is not going to be a long review.... I agree mostly with the positives.  I have listened to the entire CD 4 times now,  and with each  each time it grows and grows on you!!  I say all and all I am happy i purchased it , I feel its great entertainment for $9.99<br />I really am not turned on m by the \\"in another dimension \\" talking in the beginning or end.... but ?? thants not going to make me dilike it!!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|So it only took like 20 years for this movie to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  It's about as faithful as one can ask a movie to be for a comic.  Any more faithful, and this would've turned into Sin City with all the first person narrative (not taking anything away from that movie though).
B001EBWING|2.0|I thought this movie would be a lot better to tell you the truth. I found it to be rather boring at times. Being that its a classic movie I thought it would have a better plot! I guess I would give this movie a 2 star, for being so boring!<br />I would not recommend this movie for somone looking for an adventure and action movie!
B00361R2VU|4.0|I really liked this once the action started getting going. So, a little slow to start, but it was fun with the \\"all-of-a-sudden\\" action. I love the jump out at me scares!
141659521X|5.0|Mitch Rapp is a hard-core agent, the kind of agent Jack Bauer tries to be, and the kind of man you definitely want to have on your side.  As we read in Vince Flynn's newest Rapp novel, The Last Man, Mitch Rapp is the last man you want to come after you if he's not on your side!<br /><br />Flynn's two prior novels, American Assassin and Kill Shot, took readers back to the Rapp's roots, setting up the background for Rapp's career and solidifying the reputation he comes into in the first novel (third chronologically), Transfer of Power.  The Last Man takes place at the end of the series, following Pursuit of Honor.  Not only does it bring us up to date with Rapp, it brings us right up to date with today's headlines.<br /><br />Rapp is called in to assist with the investigation of the disappearance of a deep-cover operative in Afghanistan.  His disappearance gets the attention of the CIA due to their fear that, if the secrets in this one agent's head were revealed, many agents in the field would be compromised.  The whole thing seems fishy to Rapp from the start, and as he continues his investigation, he is targeted by an assassin and gets in the middle of an intragovernmental mess.  But true to what we know of Rapp, he overcomes injuries and setbacks and doggedly pursues truth and justice.<br /><br />Flynn doesn't disappoint with his detailed fighting action, believable political intrigue, and plot twists to keep the reader guessing.  I can relate to Rapp's intolerance for terrorist coddling, and his frustration with bureaucratic garbage.  Sure, he makes rash decisions, but he's always right in the end.<br /><br />Fans of Mitch Rapp will be delighted by The Last Man.  Readers who have never read Flynn's books will love it and will want to go back to the beginning to read them all.  All will wish and hope that the USA has someone like Rapp to call on when we need him.<br /><br />Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think I've read everything John Grisham has written so far, and I've enjoyed them all.  If you've enjoyed his previous courtroom thrillers, you will like this one as well.
6300181251|5.0|This is a real classic! I have watched this movie often since it came out in the early 60's and it's always a treat. The acting by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh is superb, it doesn't get any better than this. Don't be fooled by the remake with Vince Vaughn. It doesn't hold a candle to this one. A great Alfred Hitchcock film that doesn't age!
B008458O3S|5.0|Surprisingly good game with very few rules. Starts simple but quickly escalates. Unlike other users, I like the fact that there is no clock and no score. This makes for a game which is simultaneously challenging and relaxing.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is a gripping true story of the intervention of one man during the holocaust. Especially meaningful for us as my wife's ancestors were in the camps.
B00488SU02|5.0|Love this movie. Amazing just amazing. It opened my eyes in so many ways. Kevin spacey was brilliant in this movie.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|For my money, you can skip this depressing stuff.  Not much redeeming value - performances are o.k.  Spend your money on something better.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Lee Child has come up with another Reacher thriller while filling in some background on Jack Reacher and his Army days.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I had an older dvd set that was a gift but my first disk got destroyed.  So I order another one and played all of them and they look great.  Different package than my first one is the only difference.
159562015X|4.0|This book was really helpful in not only finding out my personal strengths but those of the rest of the office as well. We were able to see how each person's strengths can help out the office as a whole.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|Outstanding. Frightening. Entrancing. Could watch again and again.  Special effects remarkable.  Story line spellbinding. Each character is unique to the story line and the way they are intertwined generates a movie that maintains your interest.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love how easy it is to view and repin! The pages are easy to view in the Kindle browser, too.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really thought they would get back together. But overall great book as always Nicholas Sparks keeps you wondering till the very end.
1401322786|1.0|Thanks to a relative who gifts me new Mitch Albom novels as they appear, I am all too familiar with the author's creative arc.<br /><br />While Mr. Albom is free to write all the spun sugar he likes, and his reading public is free to overdose at will, for those of you who have never cracked one of his covers and might still be able to save yourselves, let me summarize the category.<br /><br />Mr. Albom likes to write about Matters of the Heart and the Lessons Life Hands Us. He has covered aging, loss, and now Time. Mitch has a particularly predictable writing style. He presents cultural archetypes (wise old codger, appreciating my old mum too late, life is short) as if they are brand spanking new, and as if they must be explained patiently and as simplistically and, Dear Lord as repetitively, as possible to his fellow human beings. Who obviously have never considered these astonishing life lessons ever before!<br /><br />Opening a Mitch Albom book is like opening a deluxe box of Belgian chocolates, only to find...not gorgeously concocted and presented delights, but a large mound of plain white sugar. He's done all the digesting for you.<br /><br />I don't care for being spoon fed obvious, saccharine messages. If you do, these books are for you.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the best Kate Morton yet. Starts a little slow and then you can't stop reading. A daughter seeks to investigate a secret only her dying mother knows.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is everything it is expected to be.  Just Wonderful Music.  Started watching them on U-tube and was glad to see they finally released a CD.  Loved their rendition of all the songs.  Just wished the CD had lot more of their music.  Looking forward to seeing what they do next.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I didn't get it at first... its repetative nature makes it seem very boring on first listen. But after opening myself up to its the subtlety and minimilism of its tone, I have discovered great beauty in it. Its the only album I can listen to any time and always have a positive experience... studying, writing, making art, thinking, meditating... its perfect for almost any situation. I have listened to this, and the album, On Land, more than any other album I own, because, frankly, I love bands like Radiohead, Sigur Ros, and other bands with similiar ambient influences, but all of them can dissapoint in the wrong moments. This album is ageless precisely because there is so little to it. Its simplicity is its child like wonder.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Great movie for those who like this type of films. Just dont like the fact that I was forced to buy a combo pack that included DVD and digital copy. All I wanted was just the Blu-Ray. Came in 1 day on std shipping.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Streaming quality was good - had no quality issues.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, I like movies that combine fantasy with history - steampunk etc. And are also set against a grey/dark palette of colors for the most part. So this movie fits the bill.<br /><br />Now would I watch it again; probably with a date. It's a fun watch.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|kathy reichs has done her usual competent job.  nothing unexpected or different from her usual format - well-written but not compelling.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I liked this movie. There's great fast paced action and lots of excitement throughout. Nice having all the charactors together to fight evil. Tame enough for the kids to watch as well. I think most people who are into actin adventure movies and comic book type themes would enjoy seeing this!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and has all of the functions one would need -- better then basic and it's free!  great job.
B009KYXEY6|2.0|The 3 deluxe tracks-- \\"Without You\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Lucky Ones\\"-- are listed on the tracklisting, but are NOT INCLUDED!! ...If I would've known this was the case, I would've just bought the Paradise EP.<br /><br />I can't return this because the CD is consider opened now!! ...This is borderline fraud, if not outright fraud.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good book, but for more about the actual experience and less filler, read \\"Two Minutes At The Gate.\\" Here on Amazon also.
0307960471|3.0|With all the previous reviews, there's no reason to outline the plot and risk spoiling the surprising ending (if that truly is the ending). Phantom continues the line of Scandinavian detective novels featuring world weary, scarred (literally and figuratively in this case), psychologically impaired, but brilliant and dogged detectives willing to cut through bureaucratic and legalistic obstacles in the pursuit of the guilty party. All this takes place in the bracing and oft gloomy weather patterns of northern Europe. The pattern is consistent with the genre. A thrilling and enticing introduction, a somewhat belabored middle section as clues and false trails are planted and interspersed with suspenseful moments, and a final rush of a \\"can't put the book down\\" climax, but here, interestingly, an ambiguous ending. To me, that's a good thing, as pat resolutions can be unsatisfying. Nesbo fans will enjoy this well written novel.
0446580848|4.0|I love all of the John Corey books and this is no exception, however, it is a little different than the others.  The action takes place in Yemen, \\"the anus of the earth.\\" and instead of fast-paced action from page 1, like the other books in the series, this book spends hundreds of pages giving the reader a background of Yemen and its tribes and politics, the crisis that is the Middle East, terrorism (especially the bombing of the Cole), Al Qaeda, Predator drones used for surveillance or armed with Hellfire missiles and the American defense and espionage groups who are operating there. The book virtually drips with Corey's cynicism with regard to the American anti-terrorist groups, especially the CIA (spooks).  Some readers found all of this \\"back story\\" to be a bore but I found it fascinating.  John Corey's smart mouth became tiresome at times but after reading every book Nelson DeMille has written about this character, I was expecting it. One thing I really liked was the way DeMille brought Paul Brenner (introduced to readers in The General's Daughter and Up Country) into this story.  Brenner is a very likable character and, though he and Corey are quite different, they work well together.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story for others but I found the ending disappointing though it was a set-up for the next John Corey/Kate Mayfield novel.  In general, I am happy that I read the book and recommend it to others though it is not the John Corey book I would recommend another reader to start with.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Fun game...great for eye-hand coordination.  Good graphics and cute characters.  I've bonded with these little penguins and find myself wincing when they get 'whacked'.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|Re-doing my review as I now have a full US boxed set (not from Amazon - I actually purchased from Walmart.com).  I have listened to most of the albums now, and can give a more detailed SQ review.<br /><br />Cosmetics:  It's a very nice looking set.  A flip-up box (be careful taking the slip cover off, however), and the LPs are all sealed in plastic and look to be the same as the individual LPs being sold, sans the big sticker.  Packaging is imo acceptable - not the 60's thick stock paper, but not the 1980's flimsy stock paper either.  Basically, if you've bought a modern vinyl LP, it's very similar packaging.  The jackets are replicas of the UK pressings, for the most part.  And the vinyl is 180g and also replicates the UK labels from the 1960's.  The book is quite nice, heavy, and well made.  Overall a very handsome set.<br /><br />Sound quality:  I'll break this up into two sections.  First and foremost is \\"how do these sound?\\".  I'm very pleased with what the Abbey Road engineers have done, with what they had.  From a technical standpoint, it's been said that these are 24/44.1k digital source - very similar to the USB stick but with no limiting (means less LOUD).  I've compared most of these LP's with 1987 CD's, a BC13 (Blue Box), and 2009 CD's.  Imo these LP's are significantly better than the CD's.  Comparing them with the 2009 CD's specifically, they are less loud, more engaging, less cold and clinical.  This obviously depends on your turntable setup, of course.<br /><br />Comparing it with a BC13 is harder.  The BC13 generally is brighter (higher treble), but also has weaker bass.  For the remasters, it's generally the reverse.  So they sound different but generally neither one beats the other imo.  If you have a BC13, these new LP's won't replace them, they just compliment them.<br /><br />The big issue I have right now, and the reason for three stars, is the problems I'm having with the actual vinyl pressings themselves.  More than half of my LPs have \\"non-fill\\" issues - it's a pressing defect that shows up visually as a stitching pattern, or \\"a string of pearls\\", in bright light.  Audibly, you hear it as a ripping sound in one channel, almost like your stylus is going over a brush.  Some of these defects are barely audible, but on some songs it's very distracting.  For example, on my copy of Revolver, \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" has quite a few non-fill defects and it basically ruins that particular song.<br /><br />Again, I did not buy it at Amazon, but so far it sounds like US pressings in general are affected by this - I guess as time goes on and more reviews are put up, we might know more.<br /><br />12/2/2012 update:  After doing a deep dive on all my LP's, I ended up with 8 LP's with issues - 7 being non-fill (that tearing sound in the left channel) and one being heavily noisy, even after a wet cleaning.  Of the 7 with non-fill, I can live with 2 of them as they are minor / in places not very noticeable.  But the other 5 are imo unacceptable, so overall 6 LP's that I need to somehow exchange or else I need to return my boxed set.fill\\" issues - it's a pressing defect that shows up visually as a stitching pattern, or \\"a string of pearls\\", in bright light.

B00A12Z264|5.0|She is, indeed, &#34;The Voice!&#34; Wonderful album with breadth and depth. The tracks are fun, high-energy, introspective and heartfelt.  XTINA is back!!! ; )
1594745692|4.0|This is a very fun deck, the art is very cool with a retro 1950's feel to it. The card themselves are printed are a very hard and durable paper. Very good quality and worth the price. The Box they come in is also well made and thematic.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|This is one of the very few CD's I can actually listen to all the way through. I only bought it for \\"Drink, Drank, Drunk\\" but have fallen in love with the entire CD. Amazing. These guys rock! \m/
1594481938|3.0|The amazing part of this book is that Nick Hornby is able to take such a depressing and sensitive topic of suicide and created a hilarious book that has you laughing after every page. I felt that emotion of the book was its strongest factor. By using a first person narrative, but switching the perspective between the different characters, you are able to get inside all of the character's minds. It also helps with character development because you can read what one characters reaction was to something that happened or something another character said. I thought a major weakness of the book was due to the fact that the book was told from the point of view of multiple characters. I felt that sometimes something would happen, and then in the next section the same plot would be retold from a different point of view. This slowed down the book, and sometimes made me just want to ditch the book. Also, if you like a book that has constant action and moves very fast, this is not the book for you. The book has a few major plot points, and really develops on them. This book would be good for teenagers who enjoy reading humorous books that have detailed plots. This book deals with issues such as suicide, pedophiles, and disability. Hornby is able to work in these serious topics into a funny book. A major part of the book that I liked is why the characters wanted to commit suicide. Some are huge, like having a son with a disability, and some are small like getting dumped by your boyfriend. The book really shows how everyone reacts to different events differently, and that everyone has different tipping points. It also deals with the fact that some can be saved and others cannot. The top of the Toppers House is used as a location of doubt. It is used as symbol of the deciding moment of life. Nick Hornby is able to effectively show that the roof is the main focal point. A long way down is a good and humorous book, but sometimes it is a slow read and sometimes feels a little bit insensitive.
0553345834|4.0|- There was a day when an MBA would be a sure ticket to riches and a promising career. However those that have succeeded in business always tend to have a competitive edge. In What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School: Notes from a Street Smart Executive by Mark H. McCormack, the author takes you into the no nonsense business world. He has made it in his own business and now he shares the secrets of his success.<br />As he outlines in the beginning, he tries to convey the people skills and the gut instinct needed to navigate the shark infested waters of business.<br />He divides the book up into three sections: People, Sales and Negotiations, and Running a Business.  They are the key ingredients to make it in the business world. More than book smarts, you need people smarts.<br />McCormack believes in getting to know your colleagues and observe their body language, how they conduct themselves, and their honor. Time and time again he notes that you need to listen. To work hard and have a pattern that will keep you focus on your goals. The cover notes that over a million of these books are in print, hopefully today's leaders will remember these timeless truths and reinvigorate the entrepreneurial spirit.
B009VB97EY|2.0|It was entertaining.....but lacked in the writing.  I would recommend it for watching it home, but glad I didn't see it in the movies.  Wish the romance part was more apart of it then all the dancing?
B00942S4OY|5.0|Love this album I also like their first album as well too.. Can't wait to see their 2013 tour.[[ASIN:B006OITIQE Up All Night]]
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This series has a lot going on. It is busy with horror!! I am rooting for the inmates and I am scared by some of the malevolent characters...but that is so much fun.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is about a dysfunctional superhero team that comes together with some guidance to face an alien who wants to take over the earth as king and wants to bring forth an army of aliens to help him. Great concept, a lot of superheroes, and I wondered how the creators were going to pull this off. They more than pulled it off. I was so impressed, and the movie was excellent!<br /><br />I love to watch movies that takes me away from normal. This movie had the flying worms, the alien armies, all kinds of fight scenes, and mind tricks, and the great part for me is that MOST of it made sense. It wasn't crazy by your pants, lets do anything under the sun.<br /><br />It flowed well and I followed the story easily. The one issue I had was when the hulk first appeared, and he was trying to kill Black Widow after the explosion on the ship. Why try to kill her? I watched the hulk as a kid, and he was always kind towards kids and women. So, for him to go after Black Widow was confusing. Other than that, I had a full understanding of the movie.<br /><br />All of the superheroes were fun to watch. The Hulk was scary sometimes, funny, and amazing [loved how he took down that worm]. I really liked Black Widow. I like a woman who doesn't need a man to save her. Damsel in distress does not exist for this lady. Iron Man was awesome, like always. Hawkeye was sexy! I was cheering for him when he came back to the good side. Captain America seemed a little more dark, more serious, but I enjoyed the character still. And Thor was cool. I dug the lingo that he spoke, and it was a great change to Stark's quick speech and wit. I was even impressed with Fury. He held his own, and he wasn't a slouch. Solid, great characters.<br /><br />So, overall the movie was very good to me. I can see why people loved it so much. I know I did.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|[This review is of the standard three disc (50 tracks) edition]<br /><br />Fifty years after forming, the Rolling Stones release 'GRRR!,' a career retrospective that, imo, is far superior to their 40th anniversary release, 'Forty Licks,' though it's debatable whether it's really essential for owners of that set, even with the two new tracks and slightly better sound. Like that previous collection, it serves as both a great introduction to the band for newcomers, and as a nice compilation of their most essential tracks for the casual fan. But, even more so than that last set, it also serves as a remarkable historical document for the more serious fan, showing the evolution of one of rock's most important bands.<br /><br />The key advantage that this collection holds over 'Forty Licks'--besides the fact that it's ten tracks longer--is that the track sequencing is in chronological order (though the Summer of Love-era \\"She's a Rainbow\\" is placed with the early 70's tracks for some reason), and shows just how far the band had come in just a few short years, from a charismatic R&B covers act with an attitude to one of the biggest and most influential bands in the world. There are 24 tracks from the 60's, twelve from the 70's, seven from the 80's, three from the 90's, and four from the 21st century--two being brand new--providing a pretty comprehensive overview of their career.<br /><br />The sound quality on 'GRRR!' is stellar, with none of the clipping (distortion, basically) common to a lot of modern day reissues of older material, as it appears this collection uses the same versions as were on the excellently remastered albums released over the past decade or so (though edited in some cases)*. The songs do seem slightly louder than on their remastered studio album counterparts and 'Forty Licks,' but the dynamic range is not affected as far as I can tell. The quiet parts are still quiet, and the loud parts are still loud, thankfully.<br /><br />The two new tracks, \\"Doomand Gloom\\" and \\"One More Shot,\\" didn't do much for me initially, but the patented Stonesy sleazy swagger of both tracks is beginning to grow on me, as some of the band's best material have had to do in my case over the years (including almost all of 'Exile,' an undeniable masterpiece...not that I'm comparing). Within seconds of playing each song, there's no mistaking just who's performing them.<br /><br />The one major negative about this set is that, like 'Forty Licks,' many of the tracks here are in edited form. I would have preferred to pay a few extra bucks for an extra disc if it meant getting the full versions, but considering this is a collection of their hits, which are usually presented in edited form on the radio anyway, this shouldn't be a huge deal to the casual fan, who are probably the main target of this release.<br /><br />Even though hardcore fans will own most of these songs already, it's still awesome to hear--with pristine sound--the progression of this inimitable band over the years, so I definitely recommend 'GRRR!' for both them and for those who just want the band's essential tracks in one place. It's amazing to think that the Stones are still going strong after 50 years, with no signs of letup in sight. To me, they are the perfect \\"anytime\\" band. Morning, noon, night, rain, snow, whether you're happy or sad, it's the perfect time for some Stones.<br /><br />Though they will probably always be known as the second greatest band of rock's golden age, no band defined--and still define--rock and roll like the Stones. They exude--ARE--rock and roll. And there's no better evidence than this collection.<br /><br />(*Edit--Someone in the comments section brought to my attention that the more recent remasters, such as 'Some Girls' and 'Sticky Fingers,' do contain clipping. I've compared many of the mid-late 60's tracks here with their 2002 remastered counterparts, and they appear the same to me, with no clipping. I'm not hearing any clipping on the 'Some Girls' and 'Sticky Fingers' tracks here either.)

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a great read and is a must for anyone growing up in the 80s that played video games.  The story was quick paced, funny, and full of nostalgia for those of us that look back fondly on our wasted youth spent in arcades or in front of the Atari.

386521584X|3.0|The only reason I don't give the full five stars review is because I don't think the print is good enough. I'm sure they could do better. Another reason is because I got this book at $120 and now you can buy it for just $35!!! the same 2008 issue and everything.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best documentary photography books.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett has become one of my favorite writers, and Winter of the World is one of the reasons.  It grasps you from the opening chapter and keeps you on the edge of your seat through the end.  I would say it was even better than Fall of Giants, and that's saying a lot.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 is awesome!  I'm really glad Amazon makes it available.  Very cool to be able to watch it without having to subscribe to satellite or cable and pay for a bunch of channels that I never watch. Thumbs up to Amazon!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout DVD is the most amazing thing anyone can ever try!!!! I never really though that workout videos could give anyone results, but I was wrong. Really wrong. This thing is for real. So I bought this DVD because running was getting boring and given that it was starting to get dark really early (daylight savings), I didn't want to accidently get hit by a car or something (especially in my neighborhood). And also seeing that Jillian Michaels is one tough trainer, I decided to give it a try. I \\"previewed\\" Level 1 first to see what I was getting myself into and it seemed easy to me. Honestly, it didn't look that hard. But once I actually starting doing the workout, I was dead by the end of it. Dripping with sweat, while the workout girls smiled away. It was frustrating just seeing them standing there all happy, while I'm laying on the ground beyond tired. But I decided to keep going with the workout.<br />Now this DVD has 3 Levels, and each one gets harder, but that's what makes it work. I did each level for 2 weeks before moving on to the next one. After doing just Level 1 and 2 for 4 weeks, I lost 10lbs. Now that may not be a lot to some of you, but it is in my book. Especially for this workout being only 25-30 Mins long. Right now I'm on Level 3 and I'm hoping that by the time I complete the entire workout, I'll have lost at least 5+ lbs more.<br />This 30-day Shred really works and if you stick to it, you will see results. But you have to commit. Don't half-ass the workouts. Make it seem like each day is your \\"last chance workout\\" and you'll start to see your body change right before your very own eyes.
1439153663|3.0|Not badly written but a trite, not very original story. Engrossing for a while, but deteriorates into predictable soap<br />opera. Too much like The Help and not really worth the time to read it.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|And it really is a ghost story that isn't for children at all. It is a little surprising that the first big budget animated version of this story is also the scariest version ever filmed. Putting the Disney name before the title probably misled some into thinking this version was made especially for kids. I love the whole film but the part with the ghost of Christmas past is pure magic. If the scene with the shrunken Scrooge being chased through the streets by the black carriage seems out of place it's because it's not in the original story. Also the ghost of Christmas present dissolving into a skeleton is another new addition to the original. These things add thrills but they're not Dickens.
1423140605|5.0|I love Rick Riordan.  I have a bachelor's degree in English and taught such for nine years.  His writing style is intelligent enough to satisfy my English degree snobbery, but also fun enough to satisfy my sense of fun.  These are great books to get middle school boys into, but start all the way back at Lightning Thief or the story might not make sense.  Warning: this one has a total cliffhanger ending and I am already dying for the next one!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|\\"Stories are a different kind of true.\\"<br /><br />RECAP:<br /><br />Five year old Jack and his Ma have spent the last five years living in ROOM. Jack doesn't know anything other then what his Ma has taught him and what he has learn from TV. To Jack ROOM is the world and there is no OUTSIDE. He spend his days doing different things with Ma and then hides in WARDROBE when Old Nick comes to visit. Old Nick is not very nice but Jack has to be quiet and hide from him.<br /><br />When Ma makes the choice of finally revealing to Jack that the world is bigger then just ROOM life as Jack knows it changes forever. Ma is shutting down and Old Nick is terrible. Jack must save Ma and she has a plan. Although he is scared he will do it for Ma.<br /><br />Will Jack and Ma finally be able to get out of ROOM? Or will Jack refuse to leave?<br /><br />MY TAKE:<br /><br />This book was written as if being told by Jack so you spend the whole time in his head. And although it was a good concept I found it a little disconcerting when at points he sounded like a five year old and others he sounded like an adult.<br /><br />Through Jack you learn about the life he and his mother have been living and everything after their escape. It is truly a very sad one and although he doesn't know what's happening you do and automatically feel sorry for the life he's had to be brought up in. The journey Jack takes when he finally is able to see the OUTSIDE is one that you comprehend and expect. Taking a person from the surroundings they were born and raised in and putting them in today's society can be disconcerting to anyone but more for a child. Seeing him adjust to the new people in his life and new environment is amazing.<br /><br />Throughout the book I found myself wondering what made the author write this book in Jacks perspective and realized that in every book you read you only get the adult perspective. Never the child's perspective and it's what made the book so unique.<br /><br />I did like the book and the concept of the child's perspective but I couldn't get my head wrapped around the writing and behavior of the child and at times the mother. I understand that in order to be able to understand the behavior you would need to know about their sufferings but that's the case with every book. In this book you just don't feel the connection just the sympathy of their situation. The mother is at times very rude and selfish when she is trying to be helped and the boy is rude and gets away with it. Even in their situation, a little bit of discipline wouldn't have been bad.<br /><br />All in all an Okay read. I would recommend it because it is a different perspective of a crime that is still sadly committed in today's society.the book and the concept of the child's perspective but I couldn't get my head wrapped around the writing and behavior of the child and at times the mother.

B009AMAMF2|4.0|How do you even begin to write a review for Cloud Atlas? I saw it two days ago, and woke up at 4:15 this morning, thinking about how to organize my thoughts into a coherent assessment.<br /><br />I will probably fail.<br /><br />If I were to attempt to sum up the movie in a single paragraph, I would say that it deals with how souls change over time. We are shown six distinct time periods. Several actors appear as six different characters across these six moments in time. Oh, the time periods all feature different genres too. I would imagine the movie is attempting to make us question the meaning of life itself, and how it might be represented on some sort of eternal scale. It's like watching the offspring of [[ASIN:B00005JKJA Mulholland Dr.]] and [[ASIN:B004FVHBXY Inception [Blu-ray]]] playing on a holodeck, featuring six worlds across 500 years, using a [[ASIN:B004FHCH96 Memento (10th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]-style narrative.<br /><br />In order to make sense of the movie and give it an accurate grade, I would have to read the book (unlikely), and watch it at least one more time (very likely when the Blu-ray is released). For now, I'll document my thoughts to see whether subsequent viewings change my opinion.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book by David Mitchell, who reportedly wrote stories for the six different time periods, utilizing six different genres, and then drew them together as the story progressed. That structure reminds me of Dan Simmons' [[ASIN:B001VFB5RA The Hyperion Cantos]], although I doubt it matches Hyperion in terms of quality. I highly recommend Hyperion to anyone who appreciates Cloud Atlas. In terms of subject matter, I'm reminded of the [[ASIN:0553565214 Daggerspell (Deverry Series, Book One)]] series, written by Katharine Kerr. It also jumps around in time, across centuries, and uses the theme of souls being continually drawn to one another. I wonder whether Mitchell is a fan?<br /><br />The six time periods used in the movie are 1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144, and the twenty-fourth century.<br /><br />Through these six stories, we learn that the souls of some of the characters involved also travel through time. However, they may change from male to female, and change race, or sexual orientation. Some souls are evil in every setting, while others switch from evil, or neutral, to good. I won't reveal any of that information because it's better to discover it for yourself.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the movie is the way the story keeps switching from one time period to another. Instead of showing each story arc from beginning to end, we are often shown two or three minutes in one time period before jumping to another. This has the effect of making it clear that the characters (or souls) exist in several or (in some cases) all of the time periods, and that's a good thing. But it also prevented me from becoming too emotionally attached to any of the characters. I found that I didn't really care about their struggles.<br /><br />The earliest story takes place on a ship (South Pacific), and moves through a hotel in the 1930s (Scotland), to San Francisco in 1973, a party set in an English hotel in the present day, before visiting the future (Neo Seoul) and far future. So you'll see two period pieces, a sequence that reminded me of [[ASIN:B000LV6VZQ The Streets of San Francisco - Season One, Vol. 1]], a story set in our current time, a science fiction segment that looks like [[ASIN:B00845MRKE Blade Runner 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (4-Disc Blu-ray / DVD +Book +UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack)]], [[ASIN:B000OPPBEQ The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B000QTD368 The Fifth Element (Remastered) [Blu-ray]]], and a post-apocalyptic tale set more than 300 years in the future.<br /><br />Technology ranges from primitive to futuristic, with the final segment being a curious blend of both.<br /><br />The strongest of the stories are the final three chronologically. In 2012, Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) is a book publisher who desperately needs money. This segment features a lot of humor and had the audience laughing throughout. The Neo Seoul story features Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae), who is aided in her quest by Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess). Here we see plenty of futuristic shots and an elaborate chase scene which would fit well in any science fiction movie. The final segment sees Zachry (Tom Hanks) meet Meronym (Halle Berry). Although the two are from vastly different backgrounds, they form a bond. It's here that the biggest struggle between good and evil takes place, and it shows how Zachry's soul evolves from what it once was.<br /><br />None of the stories are straightforward. Most are not properly resolved. I think the point is not the quests themselves, but the overall passage of the souls of the recurring characters.<br /><br />I'm probably not making much sense.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is something you need to experience for yourself, but only if you are the kind of person open to analysis and repeat viewings. This is not a coherent story with a linear structure. If you do decide it's for you, try to enjoy the individual scenes for what they are. If you are anything like me, you'll reflect on what you have seen over the next few days and things will start to take on some kind of meaning. It's certainly one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings I have ever witnessed.<br /><br />Overall provisional score 3.5/5cally.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series has everything: History, romance, intrigue and a bit of comedy added in with Maggie Smith!  My husband and I couldn't stop watching it---we found ourselves hating to go to sleep because we wanted to watch just one more episode.  I now have coworkers \\"hooked\\" as well and we are all anxiously awaiting Season 3.  Also, can't beat the Amazon price!
B0015AARJI|1.0|this controller was 100 percent different than an original controller AND the picture that he is advertising. its a knockoff. very stiff in the joysticks. there is no PS symbol in the middle. favors only 4 directions, left right up and down. horrible for fifa. ended up crapping out completely after about 3 months where my player would just run in one direction and i was unable to turn off the stupid controller. ended up just smashing the controller into pieces and throwing it away. thanks for nothing dude.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|While Angry Birds can be a bit repetitive, it's also addicting.  I have to say, I find Bad Piggies even more addicting. The ability to create your own machine, however you want, to try and get to the end is fun and inventive. I appreciate that there isn't just one way to solve it, it's all about finding your own way to solve it.  This is a fun game and it's completely addicting as always.  I would definitely recommend this one.
B001IASHWY|5.0|Both of the Hellboy movies are awesome!  The script is great, the effects are great, the characters are great...  We love the sarcastic humor and Hellboy's kitties. :)  I don't understand why Hellboy isn't as mainstream as Spiderman and X-Men, etc.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I am always waiting for Patricia Cornwell's latest book.  This one was not her best. It is not awful, just not as mesmerizing as many of her previous books. The victim from the dinosaur dig seems disconnected. Her inclusion seems to be more about providing a good name for the book than anything substantial. The book is interesting but not as intense as I expect from Ms. Cornwell.
0091922348|4.0|Although some of the recipes are a bit complicated, its a great book and so far I have loved it.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I really enjoyed the first season of AHS and eagerly anticipated American Horror Story Asylum.  The first episode - good - compelling characters and a sinister atmosphere at the asylum.  The second episode - ok - I didn't like it as much as Episode One, but I chalked that up to character and story development.  That takes time.  The following episode(s) - horrible.  Gratuitous images, torture porn, storyline that is offensive to almost every religion, race and sexual preference.  I can't watch anymore, I'm sorry to report.

B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Cute story, with interesting twists, though some of the twists were lost opportunities to create suspenseful &#34;oops-es.&#34; The main character (Maggie) is not quite believable in that her combination of inquisitiveness and naivete should get her in more trouble than it does. Still, it is fiction. Was a pleasant read.
B005LAII1C|1.0|I am stunned that my favorite super-actor, Mark Wahlberg would actually make such a ridiculous dud of a movie.  If you like this guy as much as I do ... stick with THE SHOOTER, THE FIGHTER, INVINCIBLE - all great!  Save the bucks on this one.  Sorry, but what in the world was he thinking??!!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the first book, love the second. But for some reason this second one makes me heart flutter and tears come to my eyes every time I read it. Yes I have read it several times.

B0052CK5PQ|2.0|I have been wanting to get this book since last year but have always resisted buying it because it was too expensive in any bookstore that I seen it in. I recently got a kindle and it was very reasonably priced so I got it pretty much straight away and I couldn't wait to get it started.<br /><br />I had heard (and read in many reviews) that this was a very funny book and one that really made you think. When I started reading it I didn't really find it funny and I'd like to think I have quite a good sense of humour. I found parts of the book very insulting and very contradictory with other parts of the book. To be honest I think if it was classed as purely a book about her life and upbringing (which is what a good portion of it is about) then I maybe would of warmed to it more, but I was expecting funny book about what it's like to be a woman in this day and age and whilst it kind of did touch on that subject a bit it was nothing like I had expected.<br /><br />However everyone does have a different sense of humour, maybe I just don't \\"get it\\". In my opinion I would say stay away from this book if you're looking for a book to make you laugh about issues relating to women in this day and age but if you're looking for a book about Caitlin Moran and her life then go for it, it would be a great read.
1455527475|2.0|Finished this book last night.  Maybe it's because I'm from Wall Street and the Investment Banking industry, but I was expecting a lot more bombshells and instances of completely egregious behavior.  Instead what you get from the author is a book that's mainly about his 12-year career at Goldman and anecdotal stories here and there that have been in the public domain since the Financial Crash of 2008/2009.<br /><br />Overall, 2 stars and not a recommended read.
030746363X|4.0|As a physician and a scientist I read this book with a high level of skepticism.  I looked up the references and found some of his conclusions to be acceptable but others as weak science.  So I did decide to follow his diet.  After 5 months I have lost 40 pounds.  I have been using weight watchers and was stuck and had actually gained weight.  So why did it work?  Well a couple of his rules really makes sense.  The most important is that all calories are not equal.  For my body if I eat 100 calories of something with sugar my body turns it into fat.  The concept of slow burn carbs appears to work for my body. The next most important point is that you have to just eat the same thing over and over again.  Being a good cook I have been able to create a series of meals that I really enjoy and I loose weight on.  Thus, I really do not ever feel hungry and I really enjoy what I am eating.  This is not to say that I do not enjoy my once a week cheat day.  I am such a type A person with an on/off switch.  I have not cheated once in the past 5 months other than on my cheat day.  Why? Because if I want to cheat on something I just put it on my list and eat as much as I want on my cheat day.  I have yet to check my cholesterol etc, I plan to do it afar 6 months but my cholesterol etc has always been good.  Finally, what about exercise.  Well this is where I do not agree with the book. I work out hard and enjoy it. I usually do 4-5 days a week doing a variety of workouts including swimming, boxing, cross training and weight lifting.  Again another point that is a key to this book is this is what works for my body and I just had to find the right formula of diet and exercise for me.  The rest of the book about sleep and sex is highly suspect and I did not but skim it and laugh.  This diet is not for everyone but it is something I can easily do for my life it just makes sense to my body. I hope you find these comments helpful and encourage everyone to find a lifestyle of healthyeating and exercise that works for you.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This movie is really great, the CGI is great & there should be a new Tinkerbell movie called \\"Tinkerbell and The Arrival of Peter Pan\\" and Periwinkle, Tinkerbell & their friends should be in this movie, & Periwinkle & Tinkerbell really should go with Peter Pan!

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have been a Cornwell fan for years. One of the things that I enjoyed was the wonderful detail.  However, in this novel there was so much of it, on every line about every thing that it overshadowed the entire story.  The plot was unusually slow as a result and never quite took off. (At least for  me)<br /><br />It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't her best by a long shot.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|I tried this product from Amazon, delivery was delayed and there was no tracking no provided so<br />i could not follow up( It was mentioned in the fine print that the product tracking cannot be done as it comes by snail mail), Since it is made with a really light coloured material,it tends to get dirty very very fast, wouldn't recommend to people who have a rough usage, also it does not protect the bezel on the top as it is exposed, the card pocket is not very useful.<br />It is well constructed, seems tight at first but loosens up subsequently, the leather feels nice in the hands.All in all an avarage product but not something great.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|While I have read a few different books on the SEALs and modern day military combat, I have never been one to read biographys.  However, since this book was about a SEAL Team Six operator, I figured I'd read it.  I'm sure glad I did.<br /><br />I thought the book was simply amazing and gave a great insight into the life of Adam Brown.  He was not only a great American hero that died fighting for and defending our freedom, but he was also a devoted husband, father, and all around good guy.  It was very inspirational to read his story and to hear of all the various hardships he overcame in order to be successful and the best that he could be.<br /><br />I could not put this book down and highly recommend it to everyone.  You don't have to have a strong interest in the military to enjoy this book.  It can be an inspiration to anyone.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors is fabulous.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers was born to play this role and his selection as Henry is just one example of the brilliant casting work done for this series. The acting is top-notch. The costumes and jewelry are something to behold. The stories take the viewer in right from the start. The scenery, both real and computer-generated, is wonderful.<br /><br />This series is close behind The Sopranos as far as overall entertainment excellence.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I've only read the first few chapters but so far it's very interesting. There is so much information in this book. It's much more than just a book on losing weight, (which was the reason I bought it) the book goes into great detail about the origin of the wheat plant and studies that have been done on humans and animals involving wheat. Like I said, I've only read the first few chapters but I'm very impressed so far and can't wait to read the rest.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I heard many rumors that this series was just like re reading 50 shades I pick it up out of curiosity and actually enjoyed it!!! While the 2nd book has more aspects of 50 shades it still presents the characters differently as well as gives them more background!!! I am going to die waiting til May for book 3 but cannot wait

159514188X|4.0|What if the girl you had a crush on committed suicide? And what if she sent you cassette tapes to listen to, with 13 reasons why, or rather 13 people implicated -- and you're one of them?<br /><br />That's the premise behind Asher's novel, a suspenseful tale of high school rumors, betrayal, loneliness, love and more. Told in intertwined 1st person narratives between Hannah (the girl) and Clay (her admirer), readers get a sense of Hannah's gradual decline into despair and Clay's growing frustration, sadness and anger over her decision.<br /><br />Although the narratives are differentiated by italics / normal font, I did have to re-read sections to be clear on voice. Chalk it up to my late-night reading or lazy reading or too-fast reading, but this is a book that requires paying attention. However, a theme comes through loud and clear: every action, every word matters.<br />Lisa Ard<br />Author of the Dream Seeker series and Saving Halloween

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I noticed that a lot of people have given this book less stars then the previous two books.

Give this series a shot and you will love it too!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|As a faithful Kay Scarpetta fan, I felt that The Bone Bed was a good read without much character development.  On one level, I enjoyed the character's \\"inner voice.\\"  However, at times, it was annoying and disrupted the flow of the story.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The story was way too long in unfolding.  The story was good, but the outcome was fairly predictable. I am a huge fan of Nelson DeMille, but his last few efforts have failed to excite. John Corey is a great character but I felt his sarcasm was overdone.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this book was great!! It was an easy read with a very clear storyline. It followed her first book great and I cannot wait for the third one, just sorry we have to wait so long.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|The viewing quality was great through my ROKU was just a little bummed as it wasn't as thrilling as the advertisement made it out to be.  I think the maker could have made it a little more thrilling and chilling but it was alright.  I don't want to buy it though.

Otherwise, its a great game on iphone. I'm going to play it on their instead. If I knew there were this many glitches during the game I wouldnt have bought it. So my advice? Stick with the iphone version instead.or get it on something other than kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! To all the people who say it is a porn book are only 50% right, its has the best plot/story line I have ever read. I would read this over and over again just for the thrills, emotions, and confusing scenes that have played out in my head! Well done

B003F3NEBG|5.0|Previously we've owned the Special Edition (the two disk set with extra features on the making and casting of the original BBC mini-series).  We love that edition and have watched it on numerous occasions.  However, the difference between watching the Blu-ray version and the regular DVD is like the difference between real life and a grainy photograph.  The only thing I found a little cumbersome was when watching the whole series in one sitting, rather than having a brief pause between each episode (as the Special Edition DVD set has it) we are required to either watch or fast-forward through the introduction of each episode (theme music, credits, etc...).  But even with all that, it's still well worth it.<br />As for the version starring Keira Knightley, I've watched it, but I can't stomach watching it again.  Ms. Knightley is no Miss Elizabeth Bennett.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great read.  Actually enjoyed it a little more than \\"Under the Dome\\".  Part love story, part historical fiction, part sci-fi...It was a page turner from the word go.  Nobody can pull the reader in like King.  His prose gets better with age.  His skill at story telling endures.  As long as I don't have to hear him bloviate on his personal political views, I'm good.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|I was skeptical of this movie, thinking it was just another Transformers special effects thing.  But I saw one of those Starz reviews that talked about how the director impressed on the actors about what the military does for us.  So we went to see it in the theater when it was out.  Yes they did work in some hokey Battleship game deal where you shoot the coordinates &#34;B-15&#34; stuff, but it had a little logic behind it.  Not to be a spoiler, but I really like the way they brought in &#34;the old guys&#34; to save the day. This movie does honor the military.  If you liked Independence Day, you might just like this one too.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|I felt that the story left a lot to be desired. So what I'm supposed to get from this movie is that there is power in being the fairest? Could've been much better.

0316223239|3.0|The book that I am reviewing is Room by Emma Donoghue.  The story is about a 5 year-old boy named Jack who has lived in a room with his mother since he was born.  Jack and his mother are being held against their free will, but to Jack this life seems normal because it is the only life that he knows.  Jack's mom is determined to keep her son happy.  She does what ever she can to teach him to read and keep him safe so he will learn and grow.  To Jack he is fine in this room because he is with his mother who he loves very much.  Overall, I feel that the book is thoughtful and creative and sends various messages throughout the story.  It is very interesting for me to see the way we live in a different light.  For example, to Jack, weekly supplies to his room on Sundays are exciting and he doesn't understand the reason for these deliveries.  He also doesn't realize the torture that his mom has to endure.  This is also a great story because you can see how close a mother and son can be. The thing that I liked best about the book is that the story was unpredictable.  For this reason I couldn't stop reading.  It can definitely be said that Emma Donoghue knows how to grab the reader into her book.  I found it interesting that the idea of the story has a scary concept, but since Jack tells the story, it doesn't seem scary to me at all.  There are many things that I like about the book, but on the other hand, there are some things I would have done differently if I were the author.  One thing that I was not fond of is how the book is laid out.  I feel that the whole first half of the story could have been condensed.  To me the majority of the first part of the book seems to be just descriptive details of the characters and how they live rather than an actual plot.  At the half waypoint of the book I was getting a little bored.  It seemed at this point that the main problem in the book had already been resolved, however, as you read on, you do see a reason for the second half of the story.  Life inside the room is not easy for Jack and his mom, but neither is life outside of the room.  The second half of the book allows the reader to sympathize with Jack and his mom just as much as you do in the first part.  As for the target audience of the book, I feel that the book is a great read for many different kinds of people.  However, it is definitely not the best book for younger children to read.  Not so much in the sense of bad language, but more for the reason that there are some ideas that only maturity can help one understand.  I feel that this is a good book for a reader that is in high school or older.  I also think that moms could really relate to the relationship between Jack and his mother.  Overall I really enjoyed reading Room.
0634060384|5.0|Some have maintained that this book contains far fewer tunes than the original fake book. Perhaps, but it has many tunes that you will need on a jazz gig and if you can learn and memorize the changes to most of them, you should have no problems figuring out changes to songs not listed here on the fly! Highly recommended!

B0068ZZ6CI|3.0|I saw Rammstein's Made In Germany Tour and thought it was one of the top three concerts I have ever seen.  I bought this MP3 thinking it would contain the music they performed while on tour.  Unfortunately, this MP3 lacked the vibe from their concert is a more toned down version.  I am not sure what Rammstein was going for with this cut but would have preferred to hear their concert live instead of what I purchased.
0316077046|3.0|I read Beautiful Creatures, the first book in the series, a few months ago and I loved every little detail about it. Especially the setting appealed to me. A small town where everyone and their grandma knows you and your family (like...literally!) and a boy who fit in the picture all his life until...he doesn't anymore. Throw in a cute and tragic love story and the book is for me. I bought Beautiful Darkness right after I finished Beautiful Creatures but somehow put it off until now. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I still find the story in general amazing. All the little secrets in Gatlin that are uncovered throughout the novel always surprised me and kept me reading. I think Ethan is a great character. Not only is he absolutely nice and friendly and polite and funny (perfect boyfriend-material), but his development also is described so thoughtfully. During these two books and all the experiences Ethan makes the reader can really see him grow and make decisions that become more mature with every step he takes. Same with the other characters especially Link and Ridley. After finishing Beautiful Darkness I felt like I knew them all in real life.<br /><br />The plot in this book was very different from the one in the first book which took me some time to get used to. There were so many new and different settings and characters and I didn't expect the story world to expand the way it did.<br /><br />What I really didn't like in the book, though, was Lena. My favorite character from the first book turned into the most annoying one in Beautiful Darkness. Throughout the first 100 pages I was close to putting the book down quite often just because I couldn't stand Lena's behaviour. I mean, it was okay for her to act the way she did and totally reasonable, but still. Fifty pages to me would clearly have been enough to show her state of mind.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't like this book as much as i liked the first one as it was very hard for me toget through the first 100 or so pages. After that, though, it was okay, I just felt like I couldn't really get into it anymore. I'd recommend continuing the series anyway, though, because the ending of this one made me look forward to number three so much. From what you can guess from Beautiful Darkness in my opinion makes reading Beautiful Chaos unavoidable :)
0385535147|5.0|I listened to this book on audio. The narrator did a great job.<br /><br />I have been somewhat disappointed in the last few Grissom books, but have to admit I enjoyed this one. The plot took off in a direction I did not anticipate and it was fun listening to it unfold. If you like Grissom, you will enjoy THE RACKETEER.

B0042KA4VO|5.0|I am really enjoying this series. When I watched the first episode of season 1, I wasn't sure how I felt about it. By episode 3, I was hooked. I'm into season 2 now and it just gets better. I am a mature women and find the Vampire Diaries to be thoroughly entertaining and very well written. I ration myself by watching one episode each time I hit the treadmill. There are days I want to continue exercising for a few hours just so I can watch more.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Recently the northeast was hit by Hurricane Sandy.  In eastern Pennsylvania we had the Frankenstorm, lots of wind, no power for 5 days.  Thank goodness for A Dance with Dragons, in book form and kindle form.  It was a lot easier to hold the kindle and I managed to keep it charged with the neighbor's generator.  I danced with dragons during the entire blackout.  This world of Ice and Fire is a wonderful place to lose yourself, an alternate reality when it is cold and dark and you have a cat under the covers with you.  The whole series of books are a delight.

1451620829|4.0|I read a lot of rock autobiographies (Mötley Crüe, Pete Townsend, Keith Richards), and I always approach them with a contradictory mindset:  on the one hand, I assume that the stories are at least somewhat exaggerated in order to enhance their star-power appeal...but on the other hand, I feel like I have to take them at more-or-less face value, because otherwise, what's the point of reading them at all?  Given that, and my lifelong devotion to all things Kiss, I found Peter's book to be at times astonishing, entertaining, hyper-emotional, and just plain raw.<br /><br />To date, Peter's former bandmates Paul Stanley and (especially) Gene Simmons have had the biggest microphone when it comes to tailoring the \\"truth\\" in Kisstory.  They did all the work, Peter and (lead guitarist) Ace Frehley were lazy and drugged out, etc. etc.  Ace's memoirs (\\"No Regrets\\") helped tell his side of the story, but many fans were disappointed when he didn't dish a little MORE dirt in those pages.  Well, fear not:  in \\"Makeup To Breakup,\\" Peter serves up heaping platters of dirt, sometimes to the extent that he comes across as moving beyond a \\"bitchy\\" category into full-blown nastiness.  The thing is...he's also incredibly hard on himself, and for every instance that he manages to smear Paul and Gene (and Ace, as you read on), he also takes a lot of - credit? - for the ways he HIMSELF screwed up.<br /><br />Peter's drug addiction was hidden from fans for decades, but with the cards laid on the table for him (thanks, Gene!), here he admits exactly how MUCH drugging he was doing, and it's really astonishing:  mountains of cocaine, by his own admittance 5 grams a day, and not just him, but basically EVERYONE in the Kiss Kamp BUT Paul and Gene.  Manager Bill Aucoin, his lover Sean Delaney, all the crew, producer Bob Ezrin...EVERYONE was doing blow.  His wives (both Lydia and Deb), his friend John Belushi...it was constant.  Does Peter take the blame for this?  He does.  But as he does, he also paints a really accurate picture of how inescapable and \\"normal\\" it all was.  For me, the most telling point Peter made was that the four guys in the group were necessary to keep it all going: all the money, the drugs, the lifestyle...so that, if you wanted drugs, you placed an order with someone on the crew, and a whole bag was just delivered to your door:  coke, pills, booze, you name it.  Want women?  Here's a suite in the hotel with 50 of them, just come on in and take 2 or 3 at a time, then go back later for more.  All the hangers-on, from the manager on down, relied on the band for their own lifestyles, and so had to keep the members happy.  One of the interesting insights Peter makes about this extravagance is that really EVERYONE in Kiss was an addict...it just wasn't always drugs.  With Peter, it was, and for Ace, it was booze.  Gene was addicted too, though:  to sex and power.  Gene has always maintained that he voraciously consumed women, but Peter makes it real in a way Gene hasn't so far.  And Paul?  To read Peter tell it, Paul was basically addicted to...himself.  His narcissism was profound, and he used that to exercise power within the band, and the broader company that Kiss became.<br /><br />Peter occasionally lapses into some rather wincing crudity when he really lets go:  witness his referral to (current Kiss guitarist) Tommy Thayer as \\"Paul and Gene's butt boy.\\"  Ouch...that's just crass.  But he's had a long time to build up some venom, and until now, his story has only really been told in Gene's books, ex-wife Lydia's book, and interviews with Gene and Paul.  Now, he gets his say, and he holds back no punches.  The result is a whirlwind of emotion, faith, regret, and vitriol that helps balance the scales in terms of the way Kisstory is/will be written.  This isn't a book written by a current \\"rock god\\" who sees himself as bigger and badder than everyone else; it's a book written by a 67-year old man who cringes at some of his ridiculous behavior (he and Paul, naked at Gene's door, serving their balls in champagne glasses to Gene's groupie), but who doesn't hold back on CALLING himself ridiculous, and that's incredibly refreshing.  For me, this is the best of the Kiss memoirs thus far; I'm interested to see how Paul remembers these events when he finally gets around to doing HIS book.
B008G59IKO|5.0|&iexcl;UNO! delivered a more classic Warning/Nimrod era Green Day sound and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with the arrival of &iexcl;DOS! six weeks later. I didn't have much to go on other than the fact that the band called the album a \\"Party Album\\" and a \\"Dirty Rock\\" record. So what exactly is &iexcl;DOS!?<br /><br />First off, this record is very different from &iexcl;UNO! in that it has a ton of energy. Most of the songs pack a punch and the record as a whole is almost unrelenting in terms of pace. This isn't the same punk energy that you would have found on the early Green Day albums. This is something different and clearly inspired by early 70's rock. The first comparison that comes to mind for me would be The Rolling Stones \\"Exile on Main St\\", but there are about 200 albums from that era you could list that Green Day could have taken inspiration from here.<br /><br />Lyrically this could not contrast the serious political messages in American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown more. Although the content is just as real, it is different because the focus is more internal and self glorifying topics. From \\"F*** Time\\" to \\"Makeout Party\\", the guys were clearly just trying to have fun on this and not taking themselves or the lyrical tone too seriously. This record seems to be an authentic reflection of the rock star element of their lifestyle, for better or worse. The lyrics provide a window into Billie Joe's excessive lifestyle and mindset during the last few years which can be really interesting. Part of me is glad to see them let loose here and just write songs they enjoy and not care about repercussions, but some listeners on a moral high horse may be turned off by the lyrics.<br /><br />So how's the music? Overall it's catchy, and well written. There are definitely just as many fantastic songs on here as on &iexcl;UNO!. That said, it's really hard to compare the two because these tracks are blisteringly fast reinterpretations of 70's singalong rock songs--not pop punk. The tracks \\"Lazy Bones\\", \\"Baby Eyes\\", and \\"Ashley\\" are probably the best constructed songs, and there should be no surprise that these tracks also sound the most like classic Green Day tracks. Another highlight for me is \\"Wow! That's Loud\\" which has a chorus on it that will make any fan of The Who squeal with delight. The only two songs which break from this aforementioned fast pace are \\"Nightlife\\", which shows Green Day experimenting collaborating with a female rapper, and \\"Amy\\", which is a gorgeous acoustic track about the late Amy Winehouse.<br /><br />Overall I have to say I really enjoy this record. I feel the casual Green Day fan may have a negative reaction to this album because there's no \\"singles\\" and they probably never heard the Foxboro Hot Tubs project, or have a great appreciation for late 1970' rock. Selling over 60 million albums worldwide, Green Day has become a household music brand name at this point. This brand name correlates with a certain amount of refinement and production that this record simply does not have, and that lack of polish is the exact point of this record!<br /><br />As a rock music junky I absolutely love this record, but for marketing purposes this record maybe should been a second Foxboro Hot Tubs album. I say that because that's really the context you should listen to this album in. If you haven't heard that Green Day side project, grab it now. Grab it BEFORE you listen to &iexcl;DOS!. You will enjoy this record much more.<br /><br />All in all this is a really fun Rock `n' Roll record and that's all it was meant to be. Don't take it too seriously and might have a really good time; I did!\\"Lazy Bones\\", \\"Baby Eyes\\", and \\"Ashley\\" are probably the best constructed songs, and there should be no surprise that these tracks also sound the most like classic Green Day tracks. Another highlight for me is \\"Wow! That's Loud\\" which has a chorus on it that will make any fan of The Who squeal with delight. The only two songs which break from this aforementioned fast pace are \\"Nightlife\\", which shows Green Day experimenting collaborating with a female rapper, and \\"Amy\\", which is a gorgeous acoustic track about the late Amy Winehouse.<br /><br />Overall I have to say I really enjoy this record.

B00A14SQBU|1.0|See the Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore film \\"Music & Lyrics\\"...CA has morphed into the Haley Bennett character Cora Corman...priceless! On the off chance that Christina meant this as satire... kudos! If not...wow.
0743297334|1.0|I am an avid reader but I had never read Hemingway before. I don't get it. This book read like a ten year old wrote it. I realize this was written when hex was in his 20's and this was supposedly a new writing style but it sure didn't feel like a modern classic. JMOO.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game brings back memories of being avoid and losing all your quarters. But this is one better you don't lose any money. It may be slow to generate coins but I can wait
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of Grisham's best but still an enjoyable read. Sudden shift in the plot lost me for a short time but Grisham brought me back within a few chapters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app, it's very useful for determining how much charge is left in my Kindle Fire HD. It also gives you a plethora of other information, some of which I'm not sure why I need, but it's cool to look at anyway. And it will be fun to exlore.<br /><br />The only thimg I didn't like was the ads in the free version, so I bought the pro version.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I have to say that I discovered Craig within this book, not on his late, late tv show. I just don't stay up that late, however, since reading his book<br />and enjoying it, I have made the effort to watch hm on his show as well as in concert. I consider Craig one of best stand up comedian today. If you don't<br />know him, make the effort and you won't be disappointed. Thanks Craig!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This movie was amazing.<br />I have a little sister who is really into Tinker Bell and loves all the movies but this one has to be her favorite. This one made me cry with all the twists it had.<br />I am so glad that I rented this movie.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Movie was just ok.  Definetly a rent and not a buy.  Very slow in parts and didn't finish the way you might want it to.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app has become one of my most invaluable apps! It has come in handy while fishing to show a variation on tying, in camping to rig up some canopies using different techniques, and also to just show off the cool knot app! Def must buy!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Different than other renditions of Sherlock Holmes but captures the near psychotic nature of the character.  Very good will be watching more.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My kids and I are enjoying this game but wish things were not as expensive. There r a few glitches and upgrading is more expensive to do then buying new places...which is weird. But we r slowly moving along. Invite me suddenlyhope
B00920HMNM|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3UL3NF1GL06XU]]Donald Fagen is a great artist and this is a great album, which you should buy. However, before you purchase the vinyl version, you may like to hear about my experience.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie has become a staple for the holiday viewing...Very Well Done...  I would recommend this movie to all families...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The beginning is a bit slow-ish, but then as some of the characters are established and the action really sets in it becomes an easy page-turner. The end gives resolution but leaves you wanting more. It's a good series, especially if you like post-apocalyptic/dystopian fiction.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Oh well, I have heard about this movie since the 80's and finally decided to see it.  It was great even decades after its release.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|good cast very entertaining great shots of england great story line enjoyed every moment hope that they make more asap
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed read more about Gideon and Eva......  the book was great, I can't wait for the next book, to see where those two go from here.<br />If you liked<br />\\"Bared To You\\", you will love this one...
0385535147|4.0|In this novel, you sometimes are not sure who to root for.  Some nasty pieces of work, and some nasty things done to people, but sometimes people deserve what they get.  And there is that big payoff that does not seem to legally belong to anyone.  Finders Keepers.<br /><br />Malcomb Bannister was a small town lawyer in Virginia, struggling to get by.  Then a \\"friend\\" in DC gets him involved doing the legal paperwork for a real estate transaction.  It looks like a nice fee for his firm until someone starts laundering money through the trust account.  His mistake at that point was being too honest.  He could have grabbed a few million from the account and ran - transfer the money to Panama? - he could have sent it to an account of his own in the Seychelles.  Instead he gets involved in a RICO prosecution.  He is a small fish but gets snared in the net and ends up with a 10 year sentence in a federal prison where he becomes a jailhouse lawyer.  Now he has a plan.<br /><br />This is a twisted plot.  The FBI is trying to solve a high profile murder.  Malcolm offers them a deal- the name of the gunman and his motive in exchange for a commutation of his sentence and a new identity (he knows things that they have no hope of finding out).  Nobody trusts anyone else.  Malcomb knows all the legal angles - he was not a jailhouse lawyer for nothing.  Everyone ends up with a little something (except that one poor sod who was the gunman).  Malcomb and a few choice friends end up with a lot.  The wheels of justice sometimes go off the track.<br /><br />I must say that the plot was different than most mysteries, or legal procedurals if you prefer to call it that.  You do get an inside look at prisons and jails.  Walk straight - you don't want to end up in one, especially in a third world country.
1451696191|4.0|(Originally on my blog, The Reader's Commute)<br /><br />For those of you who are late to the party like me, and haven't had the chance to read the book (or see the delightful movie - more about that later), Wallflower is an epistolary novel by Stephen Chbosky.  The book is told in letters, written by the narrator, Charlie, to an unnamed \\"friend.\\"  The story is set in the early 90s (which is something I totally dig, as can be seen in my last review for The Adults), where people still wrote letters and received mix-tapes  and had to (gasp) talk on home telephone lines!  Charlie is beginning his freshman year of high school, and he's very nervous about it.  Aside from losing his best friend the year before, Charlie deals with a lot of internal emotional trauma, which certainly effects his narrative voice.<br /><br />This was what was most shocking to me: the voice.  I had always assumed, from what people had told me about the book, that I would be reading the voice of a nerdy, shy teenager.  Instead, I was reading a sometimes-endearing, but also terribly-heartbreaking account of a troubled boy.  Sure, I understood Charlie's formative experiences and adored the beautiful quotes that are so often quoted on people's Facebook pages, like:<br /><br />  \\"So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.\\"<br /><br />I loved these moments.  I appreciated them.  But this book had a level of intimacy that made me uncomfortable in a way.  Believe me, I've read subject matter that has been much worse and much more explicit than this, but it was the innocence of this narrator that really tripped me up.<br /><br />I was reminded of an exercise that I did in my memoir writing class, where I had to stare another person in the eyes for sixty seconds.  It was an uncomfortable task, because I'm not used to doing that (who is?).  It was alarming, allowing someone to look me in the eyes for that long - it's almost like I felt defenseless.  However, I also felt incredibly connected in that moment, realizing I'm existing with that other person.  So maybe that sums up how I felt about Charlie and his narration.<br /><br />I read this book in a single afternoon.  When I finished reading, I kind of curled up into a ball on my bed and felt weird.  I imagine this sounds like I didn't like the book; really, I think it takes a very good book to make you feel that way.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|First off I am rating the quality of the set here.  We already know the Beatles are 5 star all the way.<br />These albums are cut from 24 bit low rate sampled masters and do not have the superior stereo image of the original fully analog pressings.  Recommend just getting the CDs instead.  The sound character of the albums is what I would call neutral with balanced frequency response.  On some material Bass particularly is more realistic. The new mastering is similar to the CD Box set though with less compression  and I like it. So that part is good.  I agree that the overall sound is good when compared to other vinyl that comes from low sample rate digital masters but it could have been so much better. The bad thing is that on a good stereo system these pressings do not sound as good stereo image wise as what fully analog Beatles pressings do.  NOWHERE near it.  The image is flat with no spatial characteristics whatsoever.  On a cymbal the effects are especially pronounced. That is to be expected from digital 24 bit/44.1 Khz sampled material.  The WOW factor is just not there.  There is NO way these are from 192/24 masters and Abbey admits it.<br />Mobile Fidelity vinyl sourced from analog masters BLOWS them away with superior stereo image and Mobile Fidelity is not known as the best sound quality vinyl out there for the Beatles.<br />The inexperienced listener who has never heard real sound and has a cheap stereo may not notice it though and may be happy.  That person would still be better off with CDs though.<br /><br />The package itself is beautiful though and looks wonderful to my eye.  I love the book. The reason for buying vinyl in the first place is to get the benefits of 100% all analog sound.  These don't provide it.  It is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into this.  But it was wasted because of a fundamental technical error in using a low sample rate digital master.  If not analog they could have at least used a 192/24 bit and things would have been all right.  If you are a digital person do not bother wasting the money on high maintenance vinyl.  The 2009 CD box set is cheaper and provides better value.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fasciating reading.  Historical details nicely woven into the stories of the characters. Interesting interweaving of the lives of the main characters.
